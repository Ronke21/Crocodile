<text>The first HMS &quot;Zulu&quot; was a Tribal (or F-) class destroyer launched 16 September 1909 at Hawthorn Leslie Shipyard and commissioned in March 1910. She was mined during the First World War, on 27 October 1916 off Dover in a minefield lain by the Imperial German submarine &quot;UC-1&quot;. Her stern was blown off and sank, but the forward section remained afloat. It was towed into port and attached to the stern of , which had been torpedoed, to form a new destroyer named .

==Construction and design==
&quot;Zulu&quot; was one of five Tribal-class destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in January 1908 under the 1907–1908 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy. The Tribal-class destroyers were to be powered by steam turbines and use oil-fuel rather than coal, and be capable of , but detailed design was left to the builders, which meant that individual ships of the class differed greatly.

&quot;Zulu&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Normal displacement was , with deep load displacement . Six Yarrow boilers fed steam to Parsons steam turbines, giving and driving three propeller shafts. The main high-pressure turbine drove the centre shaft, with the outer shafts being fitted with low-pressure turbines, together with cruise and astern turbines. The outtakes from the boilers were fed to four funnels. Range was at .

Gun armament consisted of two guns, with two torpedo tubes comprising the ship&#x27;s torpedo armament. The ship had a complement of 71.

&quot;Zulu&quot; was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie&#x27;s Hebburn, Tyneside shipyard on 18 August 1908. Construction was slowed by industrial action, and the ship was not launched until 16 September 1909, with the ship crossing the River Tyne on launching, colliding with a jetty. After successful sea trials in December 1909, &quot;Zulu&quot; was commissioned on 19 March 1910.

==Service==
On commissioning, &quot;Zulu&quot; joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. She remained part of the 1st Flotilla until 1913, when she transferred to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Portsmouth. In October that year, the Tribals were officially designated the F class, and as such the letter &quot;F&quot; was painted on the bows of the class. In February 1914, the Tribals (including &quot;Zulu&quot;), whose range was too short for effective open sea operations, were sent to Dover, forming the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.

On the outbreak of the First World War the 6th Flotilla formed the basis of the Dover Patrol. &quot;Zulu&quot; captured the German sailing ship &quot;Perhns&quot; on 5 August 1914, and collided with sister ship in both August and September that year. On 24 April 1916, &quot;Zulu&quot; took place in a large scale operation off the Belgian coast to lay mines and nets, in an attempt to limit use of the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge to German U-boats. &quot;Zulu&quot; and laid lines of dan-buoys to mark to positions for the minefields and nets to be laid. In total, 1,565 mines were laid by the minelayers &quot;Princess Margaret&quot;, &quot;Orvietto&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Biarritz&quot;. The minefield probably caused the loss of one U-Boat, , although at the time it was thought that four or five German submarines had been sunk. The destroyer was badly damaged by shellfire from German coast-defence batteries, while one drifter, &quot;Clover Bank&quot;, was sunk by a mine.

On 8 November 1916, &quot;Zulu&quot; was sailing from Dover to Dunkirk when she struck a mine, laid by , that exploded under the ship&#x27;s engine-room. Three men were killed, and the ship″s stern broke off and sunk. &quot;Zulu&quot; was towed to safety in Calais by the French destroyer .

It was decided to join the front end of &quot;Zulu&quot; with the stern of &quot;Nubian&quot;, another Tribal-class destroyer that had had her bows blown off by a torpedo during the Battle of Dover Strait on the night of 26/27 October 1916. Although these ships were not of identical design, the two sections were joined at Chatham Dockyard to produce a new destroyer, that commissioned on 7 June 1917.

<doc id="986909" wikidata="Q2744702" url="?curid=986909" title="Bearded lady">
<text>A bearded lady (or bearded woman) is a woman with a naturally occurring beard normally due to the condition known as hirsutism or hypertrichosis. Hypertrichosis causes people of either sex to develop excess hair over their entire body (including the face), while hirsutism is restricted to females and only causes excessive hair growth in the nine body areas mentioned by Ferriman and Gallwey.

== Background ==
A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. The condition is called hirsutism. It is usually the result of polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess testosterone and an over-sensitivity to testosterone, thus (to a greater or lesser extent) results in male pattern hair growth, among other symptoms. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually androgen excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis. In some cases, a woman&#x27;s ability to grow a beard can be due to hereditary reasons without anything medically being wrong.

There are numerous references to bearded women throughout the centuries, and William Shakespeare also mentioned them in &quot;Macbeth&quot;:

However, no known productions of &quot;Macbeth&quot; included bearded witches.

== Race ==
Charles Darwin&#x27;s ideas on sexual selection that influenced the perception of women with excess facial hair were applied differently across race. Women of color who had excess facial hair were actually perceived as evidence of human&#x27;s evolution from apes, whereas white women with excess facial hair were perceived as diseased. A beard on a white woman challenged her sex and medical condition, whereas a beard on a woman of color challenged her species.

Some famous bearded women were Krao Farini and Julia Pastrana.

==Entertainment ==
Notable examples were the famous bearded ladies of the circus sideshows of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Barnum&#x27;s Josephine Clofullia and Ringling Bros.&#x27; Jane Barnell, whose anomalies were celebrated. Sometimes circus and carnival freak shows presented bearded ladies who were actually women with facial hairpieces or bearded men dressed as women, both practices being lampooned by comedian and former circus performer W.C. Fields in the 1939 film, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man.&quot;

<doc id="986915" wikidata="Q475323" url="?curid=986915" title="HMS Zulu (F18)">
<text>HMS &quot;Zulu&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy and the second ship to bear the name. Built in Glasgow by Alexander Stephen and Sons, her keel was laid down on 10 August 1936, she was launched on 23 September 1937 and commissioned on 7 September 1938.

&quot;Zulu&quot; was sunk by German or Italian aircraft on 14 September 1942, off Tobruk. Some sources credit Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers from StG 3 with her sinking, but the ship&#x27;s commanding officer testified she was sunk by a combination of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built by other nations and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Zulu&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine guns. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with an above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

===Wartime modifications===
Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals&#x27; anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace &#x27;X&#x27; mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast. and two, single 2 pounder guns were mounted on the bridge wings.

== Construction and career ==
Authorized as one of seven Tribal-class destroyers under the 1935 Naval Estimates, &quot;Zulu&quot; was the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 10 March 1936 from Alexander Stephen and Sons and was laid down on 27 August at the company&#x27;s Linthouse shipyard. Launched on 23 September 1937, &quot;Zulu&quot; was commissioned on 6 September 1938 at a cost of £351,135 which excluded weapons and communications equipment that would be furnished by the Admiralty.

During 1940 she developed engine trouble and was dry docked for repairs and degaussing. She returned to service in early March when she was employed escorting convoys around the Western Approaches. In June 1941, she sailed to Falmouth for a refit. Following this, she was attached to Force H at Gibraltar.

In April 1941 she was assigned to provide Atlantic convoy defence as part of the RN&#x27;s 4th Destroyer flotilla. On 22nd May 1941 she joined military convoy WS8B as local escort during its passage in the western Approaches together with HMS Cairo, and the destroyers HMS Cossack, Bridge, Maori, Ottawa (RCN), ORP Piorun (Polish), Sikh &amp; Restigouche (RCN). On the 26th May she was detached from the escort to relieve the destroyer escorts of HMS King George V during her search for German Battleship Bismarck. on the 27th she carried out torpedo attacks on Bismarck with destroyers of RN&#x27;s 4th destroyer Flotilla.

Later the same day, &quot;Coventry&quot; was heavily damaged by Junkers Ju 88s of Lehrgeschwader 1. Dead in the water, on fire and with 63 killed she was scuttled by gunfire and torpedoes from &quot;Zulu&quot;. Aircraft continued to attack &quot;Zulu&quot; and she was badly damaged and left without engine power an hour later. According to her commanding officer, the attack was carried out by a combination of Ju 88s and Ju 87s.

The type II Hunt-class destroyer, &quot;HMS Croome&quot; came alongside to take off the surviving personnel, save for a towing party and &quot;Zulu&quot; was taken under tow by &quot;HMS Hursley&quot;. By 19:00 hours and a hundred miles from Alexandria, it was clear she was sinking and the towing party was recovered after a strafing pass by an enemy aircraft. Soon after, &quot;Zulu&quot; rolled to starboard and sank in position . Across both attacks, twelve men were killed, twenty-seven were missing and one was wounded.

<doc id="986926" wikidata="Q2606618" url="?curid=986926" title="Richard Seymour">
<text>Richard Vershaun Seymour (born October 6, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for the New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders. He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, and was drafted by the Patriots sixth overall in the 2001 NFL draft.

Seymour played in seven Pro Bowls, was named to five All-Pro teams, and was a member of three Super Bowl-winning Patriots teams. During his career, Seymour was considered to be one of the best defensive linemen in the NFL. Seymour was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2022.

Seymour was selected to the Pro Bowl both as a 3-4 defensive end and as a 4-3 defensive tackle. He occasionally played fullback on short yardage and goal line situations. However, it was stopped when he suffered a knee injury on a one-yard Corey Dillon touchdown run against the San Diego Chargers in October 2005. After his football career, he became a professional poker player.

==Early life==
At Lower Richland High School in Hopkins, South Carolina, Seymour won first team All-Region honors, first team all-area honor. As a senior, he was voted the team&#x27;s best defensive lineman, was a team captain, won an All-Area Player of the Week award, led his team to four All-Area Team of the Week honors, and finished the season with 8 sacks and 83 tackles.

==College career==
Seymour attended the University of Georgia, where he played for the Bulldogs from 1997 to 2000. He was part of a defensive line that consisted of four future first-round draft picks: Seymour, former Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Marcus Stroud, New Orleans Saints defensive end Charles Grant, and former Patriots teammate Johnathan Sullivan.

A housing and consumer economics major, Seymour was a four-year letterman at Georgia who played in 41 games for the Bulldogs, starting 25. He finished his career with 223 tackles (106 solos), 9.5 sacks, 25.5 tackles for losses and 35 quarterback pressures.

He was a first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection in 1999 and 2000. As a senior, Seymour was named a first-team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association and Walter Camp Football Foundation.

Seymour appeared in nine games during his 1997 freshman year at right defensive tackle, made two tackles and had a quarterback pressure. He also appeared in every game in 1998 as a sophomore and made 4 starts, finishing fourth on the team with 69 tackles (32 solos), 4 sacks and 14 quarterback pressures.

In 1999, as a junior, Seymour started all 11 games at right defensive tackle and led the team with 74 tackles (38 solos), including 10 tackles-for-loss, four sacks and seven quarterback pressures. He also intercepted a pass. He was named SEC defensive player of the week for his performance against the South Carolina Gamecocks. In that contest he collected six tackles (5 solos), including a pair of sacks, three stops for minus 12 yards and a pressure that resulted in an interception in a 24–6 victory.

As a senior, Seymour started ten games at right defensive tackle, recording 78 tackles (35 solos) and a team-leading 10.5 tackles for loss, and 1-1/2 sacks plus 13 quarterback pressures. He earned SEC player of the week honors following his performance versus the Tennessee Volunteers.

==Professional career==

===New England Patriots===

====2001–02====
Seymour was drafted by the Patriots in the first round (sixth overall) of the 2001 NFL draft. On July 24, 2001, the Patriots signed Seymour to a six-year, $14.3 million contract. He played in 13 games in his 2001 rookie season, starting 10 of them, amassing three sacks mainly as a 4-3 defensive tackle. Seymour missed the season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals as well as two late October games with a leg injury. In Super Bowl XXXVI, Seymour started at defensive tackle and earned a Super Bowl ring for the Patriots&#x27; victory over the St. Louis Rams.

The 2002 season saw Seymour starting all 16 games at 4-3 defensive tackle in his second season in the NFL, collecting 5.5 sacks and an interception en route to his first Pro Bowl appearance. Seymour also had a presence on special teams, blocking field goals in back-to-back November games against the Oakland Raiders and Minnesota Vikings.

====2003–04====
With the Patriots defense moving to a 3–4 in 2003, Seymour moved outside to defensive end in the scheme and was also named a defensive team captain for the first time in his career. Despite missing a game against the Denver Broncos in October due to a leg injury, Seymour finished with a career-high eight sacks and 57 tackles in 15 games played (14 starts). He was twice named AFC Special Teams Player of the Week, after blocked field goals against the Miami Dolphins in Week 7 and the Tennessee Titans in the divisional playoffs. Seymour and the Patriots would go to win their second championship in three years, defeating the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII.

Seymour was elected to the 2004 Pro Bowl and was a first-team All-Pro selection following the season.

Seymour started all 15 games he played in during the 2004 season, but missed the final regular season and first two playoff games against the Indianapolis Colts and Pittsburgh Steelers after injuring the MCL in his right knee in Week 16. He also recorded the first touchdown of his career on a 68-yard fumble return against the Buffalo Bills in Week 4. Seymour&#x27;s tackle and sack numbers dipped slightly from the previous season to 39 tackles and five sacks, but he was still named to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and was again a first-team All-Pro choice. Seymour earned his third Super Bowl win with a Patriots victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX, a game he started.

====2005–08====
Entering the final year of his rookie contract, Seymour held out of the 2005 offseason minicamps and missed the first four days of training camp in hopes of securing a new contract. While the Patriots did not fulfill Seymour&#x27;s request, they did give him a pay raise for the 2005 season in order to end his holdout. In April 2006, Seymour signed a three-year, $30 million contract extension through the 2009 season.

Seymour&#x27;s 2005 season began with the defensive end recording two sacks and averaging more than five tackles in the first four games before suffering a left knee injury playing fullback in a goal line situation against the San Diego Chargers in Week 4. He missed the next four games, returning on November 13. Seymour finished the season with four sacks and 46 tackles, and was named to his third-consecutive first-team All-Pro team as well as his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl, but did not play due to injury.

The 2006 season was the third consecutive in which Seymour endured an injury; a left elbow injury suffered in Week 7 lingered throughout the season and cost Seymour a start in Week 8, but Seymour still appeared in all 16 regular season games and the playoffs. Seymour was fined $7,500 by the NFL for stepping on Indianapolis Colts offensive tackle Tarik Glenn during a November 5, 2006, game. Seymour was reportedly angered that Glenn was diving for his knees. Regardless, Seymour professed his regret for the incident and stated he would apologize to Glenn at their next meeting. Seymour, who also had a groin injury and admitted he was not 100 percent, tallied four sacks, 40 tackles, and a blocked field goal on the season. He was named to the 2007 Pro Bowl, his fifth straight, and was a second-team All-Pro selection. However, he did not play in the Pro Bowl for the second straight season.

In the 2007 offseason, Seymour had surgery on the left knee he had originally injured more than two years prior, an injury he said had hampered his conditioning and play during the 2005 and 2006 seasons. The surgery kept Seymour out of training camp and the preseason, and eventually the Patriots decided to keep Seymour on the Physically Unable to Perform list, keeping him out at least the first six weeks of the regular season. Seymour was activated from the PUP on October 27, and played the balance of the regular season and the playoffs, including Super Bowl XLII, a loss to the New York Giants. Recording 23 tackles and 1.5 sacks, Seymour was not named to the Pro Bowl or the All-Pro team for the first time since his rookie season.

The 2008 season proved to be a much healthier one for Seymour, who started the first 15 games, only to miss the season finale against the Buffalo Bills with a back injury.

===Oakland Raiders===

====2009 season====
On September 6, 2009, the Patriots traded Seymour, who was entering the final year of his contract, to the Oakland Raiders for a first-round pick in the 2011 NFL draft that the Patriots would use to select Nate Solder. Seymour refused to report to the Raiders in the days following the trade, reportedly unhappy about being traded to the team.

The &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, and National Football Post all claimed that on or before September 10, the Raiders sent Seymour a formal letter ordering him to report within five days or risk being placed on the reserve/left squad list, which would prevent him from playing for any team in 2009, and thus would prevent him from achieving free agency until he played out his contract in 2010. The &quot;Herald&quot; reported that Seymour was in fact in possession of that letter. The next day, on September 11, he was placed on the team&#x27;s exempt/left squad list.

On September 12, the &quot;Globe&quot; reported Seymour reported to the Raiders after the &quot;Herald&quot; had reported that Seymour felt &quot;blindsided&quot; by the trade. Seymour said there were &quot;personal issues&quot; concerning his family and that an NFLPA grievance filed on his behalf, which claimed the Raiders were not allowed to send him a five-day letter, was a &quot;procedural thing.&quot; The NFLPA dropped the grievance shortly after, calling it a &quot;moot point.&quot; He did report to the team on September 12, and started in the team&#x27;s first game on September 14 in which he recorded six tackles and sacked Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers twice. He went on to start all 16 games of the 2009 NFL season, recording 47 tackles and four sacks on the year.

====2010 season====
On February 24, 2010, the Raiders gave Seymour the franchise tag. The Raiders and Seymour negotiated a long-term contract, but Seymour opted to sign a one-year deal worth $12.4 million on June 19, 2010.

Throughout the 2010 NFL season, he was a starting left defensive tackle next to Tommy Kelly on the Raiders defensive line. He was ejected during a game in Pittsburgh on November 21 for punching Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger. He was later fined $25,000 for his actions. For his play, Seymour was selected to his sixth career Pro Bowl, but did not play due to a hamstring injury and was replaced by Kyle Williams. He was ranked 66th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

====2011 season====
On February 17, 2011, Seymour agreed to a two-year, $30 million contract extension, making him the highest paid defensive player in the NFL. On opening day of the 2011 NFL season, still at left defensive tackle next to Tommy Kelly, he recorded 2 sacks and 3 tackles as the Raiders defeated the Denver Broncos. He recorded 29 tackles and 6 sacks during the season. Seymour was one of four Raiders selected to attend the 2012 Pro Bowl.

====2012 season====
On November 2, Seymour was fined $15,750 for hitting his former teammate, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel.

On February 8, 2013, the Raiders voided the rest of Seymour&#x27;s contract, effectively making him a free agent. The contract stipulated if Seymour did not meet a certain amount of allotted playing time the Raiders would have the option of voiding the final year of the deal. Due to an injury, he missed the final eight games of 2012 and was not able to meet the required amount of playing time. He was set to make $19.12 million in 2013; he counted as $13.71 million of dead money for 2013. After he became a free agent, he drew interests and received offers from multiple teams but was mostly tied to the Atlanta Falcons. It was reported that if he was unable to get the contract he was seeking he would retire.

<text>The music of the Cayman Islands, a Caribbean island chain, includes a wide selection of international pop music as well as unique folk styles. The Cayman National Cultural Foundation, established in 1984, helps to preserve and promote Cayman folk music, including the organisation of festivals such as Cayman Islands International Storytelling Festival, the Cayman JazzFest, Seafarers Festival and Cayfest. There is also a Pirate&#x27;s Week Festival. The Cayman JazzFest, founded in 2004, is a well-known jazz festival, that draws on the islands&#x27; &quot;deep connection&quot; with jazz.

The official national anthem of the Cayman Islands is &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. &quot;Beloved Isle Cayman&quot;, words and music by organist Leila Ross-Shier is the official national song.

The fiddle is a popular folk instrument. Christmas music is an important part of the Cayman folk tradition, and it consists of &quot;serenading&quot;, or group singing of Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. Instruments include the fiddle, accordion, mouth organ, &quot;grater&quot; and drums.

There is a Cayman Music &amp; Entertainers Association which represent local musicians&#x27; interests, and professional studios such as Hopscotch Studios offer recording and post-production services. Several local popular musicians are well known, including Business Time, Natasha Kozaily, Bona Fide, Cloudburst, The Barefoot Man, Chuck and Barrie a.k.a. Sea N&#x27; B, Heat, and Nicholas Johnson.

<text>In combinatorics, the symbolic method is a technique for counting combinatorial objects. It uses the internal structure of the objects to derive formulas for their generating functions. The method is mostly associated with Philippe Flajolet and is detailed in Part A of his book with Robert Sedgewick, &quot;Analytic Combinatorics&quot;, while the rest of the book explains how to use complex analysis in order to get asymptotic and probabilistic results on the corresponding generating functions.

During two centuries, generating functions were popping up via the corresponding recurrences on their coefficients (as can be seen in the seminal works of Bernoulli, Euler, Arthur Cayley, Schröder, 
Ramanujan, Riordan, Knuth, , etc.).
It was then slowly realized that the generating functions were capturing many other facets of the initial discrete combinatorial objects, and that this could be done in a more direct formal way: The recursive nature of some combinatorial structures 
translates, via some isomorphisms, into noteworthy identities on the corresponding generating functions. 
Following the works of Pólya, further advances were thus done in this spirit in the 1970s with generic uses of languages for specifying combinatorial classes and their generating functions, as found in works by Foata and Schützenberger on permutations, 
Bender and Goldman on prefabs, and Joyal on combinatorial species.

Note that this symbolic method in enumeration is unrelated to &quot;Blissard&#x27;s symbolic method&quot;, which is just another old name for umbral calculus.

The symbolic method in combinatorics constitutes the first step of many analyses of combinatorial structures, 
which can then lead to fast computation schemes, to asymptotic properties and limit laws, to random generation, all of them being suitable to automatization via computer algebra.

== Classes of combinatorial structures ==
Consider the problem of distributing objects given by a generating function into a set of &quot;n&quot; slots, where a permutation group &quot;G&quot; of degree &quot;n&quot; acts on the slots to create an equivalence relation of filled slot configurations, and asking about the generating function of the configurations by weight of the configurations with respect to this equivalence relation, where the weight of a configuration is the sum of the weights of the objects in the slots. We will first explain how to solve this problem in the labelled and the unlabelled case and use the solution to motivate the creation of classes of combinatorial structures.

The Pólya enumeration theorem solves this problem in the unlabelled case. Let &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) be the ordinary generating function (OGF) of the objects, then the OGF of the configurations is given by the substituted cycle index

:formula_1

In the labelled case we use an exponential generating function (EGF) &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) of the objects and apply the Labelled enumeration theorem, which says that the EGF of the configurations is given by

:formula_2

We are able to enumerate filled slot configurations using either PET in the unlabelled case or the labelled enumeration theorem in the labelled case. We now ask about the generating function of configurations obtained when there is more than one set of slots, with a permutation group acting on each. Clearly the orbits do not intersect and we may add the respective generating functions. Suppose, for example, that we want to enumerate unlabelled sequences of length two or three of some objects contained in a set &quot;X&quot;. There are two sets of slots, the first one containing two slots, and the second one, three slots. The group acting on the first set is formula_3, and on the second slot, formula_4. We represent this by the following formal power series in &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_5

where the term formula_6 is used to denote the set of orbits under &quot;G&quot; and formula_7, which denotes in the obvious way the process of distributing the objects from &quot;X&quot; with repetition into the &quot;n&quot; slots. Similarly, consider the labelled problem of creating cycles of arbitrary length from a set of labelled objects &quot;X&quot;. This yields the following series of actions of cyclic groups:

:formula_8

Clearly we can assign meaning to any such power series of quotients (orbits) with respect to permutation groups, where we restrict the groups of degree &quot;n&quot; to the conjugacy classes formula_9 of the symmetric group formula_10, which form a unique factorization domain. (The orbits with respect to two groups from the same conjugacy class are isomorphic.) This motivates the following definition.

A class formula_11 of combinatorial structures is a formal series
:formula_12
where formula_13 (the &quot;A&quot; is for &quot;atoms&quot;) is the set of primes of the UFD formula_14 and formula_15

In the following we will simplify our notation a bit and write e.g.

:formula_16

for the classes mentioned above.

== The Flajolet–Sedgewick fundamental theorem ==

A theorem in the Flajolet–Sedgewick theory of symbolic combinatorics treats the enumeration problem of labelled and unlabelled combinatorial classes by means of the creation of symbolic operators that make it possible to translate equations involving combinatorial structures directly (and automatically) into equations in the generating functions of these structures.

Let formula_17 be a class of combinatorial structures. The OGF formula_18 of formula_19 where &quot;X&quot; has OGF formula_20 and the EGF formula_21 of formula_19 where &quot;X&quot; is labelled with EGF formula_23 are given by

:formula_24

and

:formula_25

In the labelled case we have the additional requirement that &quot;X&quot; not contain elements of size zero. It will sometimes prove convenient to add one to formula_21 to indicate the presence of one copy of the empty set. It is possible to assign meaning to both formula_27 (the most common example is the case of unlabelled sets) and formula_28 To prove the theorem simply apply PET (Pólya enumeration theorem) and the labelled enumeration theorem.

The power of this theorem lies in the fact that it makes it possible to construct operators on generating functions that represent combinatorial classes. A structural equation between combinatorial classes thus translates directly into an equation in the corresponding generating functions. Moreover, in the labelled case it is evident from the formula that we may replace formula_23 by the atom &quot;z&quot; and compute the resulting operator, which may then be applied to EGFs. We now proceed to construct the most important operators. The reader may wish to compare with the data on the cycle index page.

=== The sequence operator ===

This operator corresponds to the class

:formula_30

and represents sequences, i.e. the slots are not being permuted and there is exactly one empty sequence. We have

:formula_31

and

:formula_32

=== The cycle operator ===

This operator corresponds to the class

:formula_33

i.e., cycles containing at least one object. We have

:formula_34

or

:formula_35

and

:formula_36

This operator, together with the set operator , and their restrictions to specific degrees are used to compute random permutation statistics. There are two useful restrictions of this operator, namely to even and odd cycles.

The labelled even cycle operator is

:formula_37

which yields

:formula_38

This implies that the labelled odd cycle operator 

:formula_39

is given by

:formula_40

=== The multiset/set operator ===

The series is

:formula_41

i.e., the symmetric group is applied to the slots. This creates multisets in the unlabelled case and sets in the labelled case (there are no multisets in the labelled case because the labels distinguish multiple instances of the same object from the set being put into different slots). We include the empty set in both the labelled and the unlabelled case.

The unlabelled case is done using the function

:formula_42

so that

:formula_43

Evaluating formula_44 we obtain

:formula_45

For the labelled case we have

:formula_46

In the labelled case we denote the operator by , and in the unlabelled case, by . This is because in the labeled case there are no multisets (the labels distinguish the constituents of a compound combinatorial class) whereas in the unlabeled case there are multisets and sets, with the latter being given by

:formula_47

==Procedure==
Typically, one starts with the &quot;neutral class&quot; formula_48, containing a single object of size 0 (the &quot;neutral object&quot;, often denoted by formula_49), and one or more &quot;atomic classes&quot; formula_50, each containing a single object of size 1. Next, set-theoretic relations involving various simple operations, such as disjoint unions, products, sets, sequences, and multisets define more complex classes in terms of the already defined classes. These relations may be recursive. The elegance of symbolic combinatorics lies in that the set theoretic, or &quot;symbolic&quot;, relations translate directly into &quot;algebraic&quot; relations involving the generating functions.

In this article, we will follow the convention of using script uppercase letters to denote combinatorial classes and the corresponding plain letters for the generating functions (so the class formula_51 has generating function formula_52).

There are two types of generating functions commonly used in symbolic combinatorics—ordinary generating functions, used for combinatorial classes of unlabelled objects, and exponential generating functions, used for classes of labelled objects.

It is trivial to show that the generating functions (either ordinary or exponential) for formula_48 and formula_50 are formula_55 and formula_56, respectively. The disjoint union is also simple — for disjoint sets formula_57 and formula_58, formula_59 implies formula_60. The relations corresponding to other operations depend on whether we are talking about labelled or unlabelled structures (and ordinary or exponential generating functions).

==Combinatorial sum==
The restriction of unions to disjoint unions is an important one; however, in the formal specification of symbolic combinatorics, it is too much trouble to keep track of which sets are disjoint. Instead, we make use of a construction that guarantees there is no intersection (&quot;be careful, however; this affects the semantics of the operation as well&quot;). In defining the &quot;combinatorial sum&quot; of two sets formula_51 and formula_57, we mark members of each set with a distinct marker, for example formula_63 for members of formula_51 and formula_65 for members of formula_57. The combinatorial sum is then:

:formula_67

This is the operation that formally corresponds to addition.

==Unlabelled structures==
With unlabelled structures, an ordinary generating function (OGF) is used. The OGF of a sequence formula_68 is defined as

:formula_69

===Product===
The product of two combinatorial classes formula_51 and formula_57 is specified by defining the size of an ordered pair as the sum of the sizes of the elements in the pair. Thus we have for formula_72 and formula_73, formula_74. This should be a fairly intuitive definition. We now note that the number of elements in formula_75 of size n is

:formula_76

Using the definition of the OGF and some elementary algebra, we can show that

:formula_77 implies formula_78

===Sequence===
The &quot;sequence construction&quot;, denoted by formula_79 is defined as

:formula_80

In other words, a sequence is the neutral element, or an element of formula_57, or an ordered pair, ordered triple, etc. This leads to the relation

:formula_82

===Set===
The &quot;set&quot; (or &quot;powerset&quot;) &quot;construction&quot;, denoted by formula_83 is defined as

:formula_84

which leads to the relation

:formula_85

where the expansion

:formula_86

was used to go from line 4 to line 5.

===Multiset===
The &quot;multiset construction&quot;, denoted formula_87 is a generalization of the set construction. In the set construction, each element can occur zero or one times. In a multiset, each element can appear an arbitrary number of times. Therefore,

:formula_88

This leads to the relation

:formula_89

where, similar to the above set construction, we expand formula_90, swap the sums, and substitute for the OGF of formula_57.

===Other elementary constructions===
Other important elementary constructions are:
*the &quot;cycle construction&quot; (formula_92), like sequences except that cyclic rotations are not considered distinct
*&quot;pointing&quot; (formula_93), in which each member of is augmented by a neutral (zero size) pointer to one of its atoms
*&quot;substitution&quot; (formula_94), in which each atom in a member of is replaced by a member of .

The derivations for these constructions are too complicated to show here. Here are the results:
===Examples===
Many combinatorial classes can be built using these elementary constructions. For example, the class of plane trees (that is, trees embedded in the plane, so that the order of the subtrees matters) is specified by the recursive relation

:formula_95

In other words, a tree is a root node of size 1 and a sequence of subtrees. This gives

:formula_96

we solve for &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) by multiplying formula_97 to get

formula_98

subtracting z and solving for G(z) using the quadratic formula gives

:formula_99

Another example (and a classic combinatorics problem) is integer partitions. First, define the class of positive integers formula_100, where the size of each integer is its value:

:formula_101

The OGF of formula_100 is then

:formula_103

Now, define the set of partitions formula_104 as

:formula_105

The OGF of formula_104 is

:formula_107

Unfortunately, there is no closed form for formula_108; however, the OGF can be used to derive a recurrence relation, or using more advanced methods of analytic combinatorics, calculate the asymptotic behavior of the counting sequence.

===Specification and specifiable classes===
The elementary constructions mentioned above allow us to define the notion of &quot;specification&quot;. This specification allows us to use a set of recursive equations, with multiple combinatorial classes.

Formally, a specification for a set of combinatorial classes formula_109 is a set of formula_110 equations formula_111, where formula_112 is an expression, whose atoms are formula_113 and the formula_114&#x27;s, and whose operators are the elementary constructions listed above.

A class of combinatorial structures is said to be &quot;constructible&quot; or &quot;specifiable&quot; when it admits a specification.

For example, the set of trees whose leaves&#x27; depth is even (respectively, odd) can be defined using the specification with two classes formula_115 and formula_116. Those classes should satisfy the equation formula_117 and formula_118.

==Labelled structures==
An object is &quot;weakly labelled&quot; if each of its atoms has a nonnegative integer label, and each of these labels is distinct. An object is (&quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;well&quot;) &quot;labelled&quot;, if furthermore, these labels comprise the consecutive integers formula_119. &quot;Note: some combinatorial classes are best specified as labelled structures or unlabelled structures, but some readily admit both specifications.&quot; A good example of labelled structures is the class of labelled graphs.

With labelled structures, an exponential generating function (EGF) is used. The EGF of a sequence formula_68 is defined as

:formula_121

===Product===
For labelled structures, we must use a different definition for product than for unlabelled structures. In fact, if we simply used the cartesian product, the resulting structures would not even be well labelled. Instead, we use the so-called &quot;labelled product&quot;, denoted formula_122

For a pair formula_123 and formula_124, we wish to combine the two structures into a single structure. In order for the result to be well labelled, this requires some relabelling of the atoms in formula_125 and formula_126. We will restrict our attention to relabellings that are consistent with the order of the original labels. Note that there are still multiple ways to do the relabelling; thus, each pair of members determines not a single member in the product, but a set of new members. The details of this construction are found on the page of the Labelled enumeration theorem.

To aid this development, let us define a function, formula_127, that takes as its argument a (possibly weakly) labelled object formula_128 and relabels its atoms in an order-consistent way so that formula_129 is well labelled. We then define the labelled product for two objects formula_128 and formula_125 as

:formula_132

Finally, the labelled product of two classes formula_51 and formula_57 is

:formula_135

The EGF can be derived by noting that for objects of size formula_136 and formula_137, there are formula_138 ways to do the relabelling. Therefore, the total number of objects of size formula_139 is

:formula_140

This &quot;binomial convolution&quot; relation for the terms is equivalent to multiplying the EGFs,

:formula_141

===Sequence===
The &quot;sequence construction&quot; formula_79 is defined similarly to the unlabelled case:
:formula_143
and again, as above,
:formula_144

===Set===
In labelled structures, a set of formula_136 elements corresponds to exactly formula_146 sequences. This is different from the unlabelled case, where some of the permutations may coincide. Thus for formula_83, we have
:formula_148

===Cycle===
Cycles are also easier than in the unlabelled case. A cycle of length formula_136 corresponds to formula_136 distinct sequences. Thus for formula_151, we have

:formula_152

===Boxed product===
In labelled structures, the min-boxed product formula_153 is a variation of the original product which requires the element of formula_57 in the product with the minimal label. Similarly, we can also define a max-boxed product, denoted by formula_155, by the same manner. Then we have,
:formula_156
or equivalently, 
:formula_157

===Example===
An increasing Cayley tree is a labelled non-plane and rooted tree whose labels along any branch stemming from the root form an increasing sequence. Then, let formula_158 be the class of such trees. The recursive specification is now formula_159

===Other elementary constructions===

The operators

and 

represent cycles of even and odd length, and sets of even and odd cardinality.

===Example===

Stirling numbers of the second kind may be derived and analyzed using the structural decomposition
:formula_160

The decomposition

:formula_161

is used to study unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, and in the derivation of the statistics of random permutations. A detailed examination of the exponential generating functions associated to Stirling numbers within symbolic combinatorics may be found on the page on Stirling numbers and exponential generating functions in symbolic combinatorics.

<doc id="986935" wikidata="Q650486" url="?curid=986935" title="Metric (band)">
<text>Metric are a Canadian indie rock band founded in 1998 in Toronto, Ontario. The band consists of Emily Haines (lead vocals, synthesizers, guitar, tambourine, harmonica, piano), James Shaw (guitar, synthesizers, theremin, backing vocals), Joshua Winstead (bass, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums, percussion). The band started in 1998 as a duo formed by Haines and Shaw with the name &quot;Mainstream&quot;. After releasing an EP titled &quot;Mainstream EP&quot;, they changed the band&#x27;s name to Metric.

The band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?&quot;, was released in 2003. &quot;Live It Out&quot;, released in 2005, was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize for the &quot;Canadian Album of the Year&quot; and for the 2006 Juno Awards for &quot;Best Alternative Album&quot;. Their third studio album, &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot;, was recorded in 2001; it was initially planned as their debut album, but was delayed for many years and finally released, with some changes, in 2007.

Metric&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Fantasies&quot; was released in 2009. It was shortlisted for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize for &quot;Canadian Album of the Year&quot;, and won the &quot;Alternative Album of the Year&quot; at the 2010 Juno Awards. Metric also won the 2010 &quot;Group of the Year&quot;. The fifth Metric studio album, &quot;Synthetica&quot;, was released in 2012. The band won two awards at 2013 Juno Awards: &quot;Alternative Album of the Year&quot; for &quot;Synthetica&quot; and &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; for Shaw. The art director/designer/photographer Justin Broadbent also won an award for &quot;Recording Package of the Year&quot; for &quot;Synthetica&quot;. Metric&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Pagans in Vegas&quot;, was released in 2015, and their seventh album, &quot;Art of Doubt&quot;, was released in 2018. Their eighth full-length record, &quot;Formentera&quot;, was released on July 8, 2022. Their ninth LP, &quot;Formentera II&quot;, was released on October 13, 2023 via their label MMI and Thirty Tigers.

In 2023, Metric ranked 41st on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s The 50 Greatest Canadian Artists of All Time.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Haines was born in New Delhi, India, to American-born parents, and was raised in Fenelon Falls, Ontario. She grew up as a dual citizen of both Canada and the United States. Her father, poet Paul Haines (best known for his lyrical collaboration with Carla Bley in the 1971 jazz opera &quot;Escalator over the Hill&quot;), often made cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to, and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt.

Haines attended Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan (future member of Stars and Broken Social Scene), and Kevin Drew (future member of Broken Social Scene). Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA. Haines attended the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992–1993, at Toronto in 1995, and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995–1996. She distributed in 1996 an early album titled &quot;Cut in Half and Also Double&quot; with a limited number of copies. The album included songs written and recorded during her student years.

Shaw, who was born in England and raised in Ontario, was attending a Boston music school when he befriended singer Torquil Campbell and Chris Seligman, both future members of the band Stars. Campbell convinced Shaw to apply to Juilliard Music School and the two moved to New York City. After a three-year classical music education at the institution, Shaw decided that his musical interests lay elsewhere; Shaw and Campbell returned to Toronto.

In the summer of 1996, Haines and Shaw met at Toronto’s Horseshoe Tavern. Bonded over a mutual distaste of the music scene, they began dating and writing songs together. In 1997, Shaw released the studio album &quot;Life on the Clock&quot; which featured Haines singing on some songs. Shaw also moved to Montreal where Haines was living. In 1998, calling themselves Mainstream, the pair self-released the five-song &quot;Mainstream EP&quot; with an overall downtempo and electronic feel.
At some point in 1998, they changed the band&#x27;s name to Metric, which was originally the name of a sound that Shaw had programmed into his keyboard while working on a song.

In the fall of 1998, Shaw, Haines, Campbell, and Seligman moved back to New York City, where they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Struggling financially during their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile roommates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio.

That same year, the band signed a development deal with Warner Bros. Records. A producer in London listened to the demos they recorded in this period and offered to bring Metric to the United Kingdom for a possible record deal. Eager to escape from the crowded conditions of the loft, Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records.

With the help of the producer Stephen Hague, Metric recorded a set of new wave/synthpop drum machine paced songs. The pair tired of recording demos, and in November 2000 returned to their Brooklyn loft to put a band together; they recruited Joules Scott-Key (a native of Flint, Michigan) as their drummer and Jarrett Mason as their bassist.

===&quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot; (2001–2002)===

Metric continued to work on their debut album in the first few months of 2001. Now dubbed &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot;, they developed a more musically layered and mature sound than the earlier &quot;Mainstream EP&quot;. Haines and Shaw completed the album in April and by this time had found a new label for their release, the Los Angeles indie label Restless Records. However, the album, produced by Shaw, was delayed for years by the label. It was finally released in 2007 on Last Gang Records.

&quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot; included the uptempo songs &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot;, &quot;Raw Sugar&quot;, and &quot;Soft Rock Star&quot;, as well as downtempo songs &quot;White Gold&quot;, &quot;The Twist&quot;, and &quot;Rock Me Now&quot; (which included falsetto singing by Shaw and spoken-word vocals by Haines in a manner reminiscent of &quot;The Mandate&quot;, and had an overall jazzy vibe). &quot;Parkdale&quot;, featuring trumpeting by Shaw and a fanfare intro, concerned the Parkdale, Toronto neighborhood. When the track titled &quot;Rock Me Now&quot; was reworked, it had been stripped of its intro &quot;bubble&quot; sounds, as well as an additional vocal part was added to the bridge. The title track was also reworked during the chorus, in which, Haines vocalizes &quot;If this is the life, why does it feel so good to die today?&quot; and the synths get a more &quot;heavier&quot; feel.

In the same year, the band released &quot;Static Anonymity&quot;, a five-song EP which they sold only at Metric performances and on their official site. Three tracks from the EP were also included on &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot;.
Metric up to this time had been for the most part a studio band; live shows could not reproduce the synthesizer-centered and drum machine-driven sound of the recordings. After recruiting a drummer to allow a stronger, more engaging live presence, Metric performed in New York in early spring and late summer 2001. They handed out handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, and later gave away the music on the internet.

In August 2001, the television commercial &quot;Be Afraid&quot;, advertising Polaroid&#x27;s I-Zone Pocket Fortune film, used music from the song &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot;, with the line &quot;Why does it feel so good to die today?&quot; changed to &quot;Why does it feel so good to fly today?&quot;.

In March 2002, Metric performed at Canadian Music Week. The band&#x27;s performance was criticized in an article in University of Waterloo&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Imprint&quot;, where the reviewer referred to the band&#x27;s music as &quot;derivative, pretentious, boring pap at its most mediocre&quot;.

By the end of 2002, Metric had gained another bandmate: the bassist Joshua Winstead (a native of Texas), who was in town performing with long-time friend Scott-Key in the local music scene.

Throughout the summer of 2007, four new songs were road-tested by the band, tentatively named &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, &quot;The Hooks&quot;, &quot;Stadium Love&quot;, and &quot;Up in Flames&quot;. On October that year Metric played a live webcast show on Myspace&#x27;s &quot;Hey Play This&quot; programme, playing requests sent in by fans.

Haines and Shaw performed an acoustic version of &quot;Help I&#x27;m Alive&quot; on January 22, 2010 for the Canada for Haiti telethon. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K&#x27;Naan&#x27;s song &quot;Wavin&#x27; Flag&quot; to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti.

On May 11, 2015, Metric released &quot;The Shade&quot;, the first single off their upcoming album. The single marked a noted departure for the new record from Metric&#x27;s more guitar oriented synth rock, and leaned more heavily on synthesizers, with electronic and pop stylings.

==Music style and perspectives==
Metric&#x27;s music style has been described as indie rock and alternative rock, with elements of new wave, post-punk revival, synthpop, and dance-rock. Sounds generated by synthesizers are prominent in their songs.

Their sound evolved from the mellow/downtempo style of their early EPs and &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot; album, to the new wave style of &quot;Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?&quot;, then more hard rock on &quot;Live It Out&quot;, then to the accessible indie rock of &quot;Fantasies&quot;, and to the more grandiose of &quot;Synthetica&quot;, and then the electronic of &quot;Pagans in Vegas&quot;, later fusing this with their gothic rock and new wave styles for &quot;Art of Doubt&quot;. Some of their songs (like &quot;IOU&quot;, &quot;Succexy&quot;, &quot;Combat Baby&quot;, &quot;Monster Hospital&quot;) include anti-war messages.

The band also recorded many covers from artists like Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Pet Shop Boys, The Church, Death from Above 1979, Brenda Lee, Tom Waits, Neil Young, Blondie, The Strokes, Morrissey, Tame Impala and Elliott Smith. They also released many acoustic versions of some of their own songs on deluxe versions of some of their albums.

==Touring==

Her other keyboard is a Nord Wave with a custom built stand. James Shaw plays guitar and Winstead plays bass. Both Shaw and Winstead occasionally play a synthesizer each, and also sing backing vocals. Joules Scott-Key plays drums.

<text>Loretta Purdy Spencer (born June 20, 1937) is an American politician who served as the 66th mayor of Huntsville, Alabama. Her first term began October 4, 1996, and her last term ended on November 3, 2008.

==Early life==
Spencer has been a resident of Huntsville since age 7. She graduated from Huntsville High School, and holds a bachelor of science degree from the University of Alabama. Spencer was the first woman mayor of Huntsville, and the first woman mayor of one of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;four main cities,&quot; which also include Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery. When Spencer was first elected mayor in 1996, she was the co-owner of a local funeral home. Spencer is a former teacher in the Huntsville City School System. Spencer, who is divorced, has two children and four grandchildren.

==Mayoral career==
Spencer first ran for mayor in 1996, after then-mayor Steve Hettinger announced he would not seek another term. Spencer was supported by Hettinger, leading her runoff opponent, Larry Mullins, to attack both as agents of the status quo. Facing a field of ten opponents, Spencer made the runoff, which she won by a convincing 66%–34% majority.

During her first term, Spencer garnered editorial praise for rejuvenating Huntsville&#x27;s economic development. &quot;The Huntsville Times&quot; stated that her &quot;string of recent successes is a whiff of the famous optimism and spirit that characterized the city for decades.&quot; At the end of her first term, Spencer was re-elected without a runoff, taking 58% of the vote.

In 2004, Spencer won a third term. During the 2004 campaign, Spencer came under attack on several issues. First, she was criticized for the state of Huntsville schools. She was also criticized for allegedly favoring the wealthier southern areas of Huntsville over the northern neighborhoods with larger minority populations. This criticism may have been reflected in voting results, in which Spencer failed to carry precincts in north Huntsville. Although forced into a runoff, she won that runoff with 55% of the vote.

In January 2007, Spencer was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Huntsville/Madison County Chamber of Commerce. Later that year Spencer was embroiled in controversy when the fire chief she had appointed resigned after only 18 months on the job. It emerged that he resigned after Spencer confronted him over alleged sexual harassment for his conduct toward a city employee, for which the city was later sued. In 2008, this suit was settled, and the city reportedly was not required to make any payment to the plaintiff.

Among the accomplishments for which Spencer claims credit are a Target Distribution Center, and the construction of Toyota&#x27;s V-8 engine plant in Huntsville. She points to the opening of two new schools, and in her third term, the rebuilding of one high school, with others in the planning stages. Spencer’s plan for tax incentive districts, she asserts, have provided $75,000,000 for capital improvements to Huntsville City Schools. Spencer advocates volunteer involvement, and points to her own work in volunteer efforts such as the United Way, Community Free Clinic, Huntsville/Madison Co. Botanical Garden, and the Boys &amp; Girls Club.

In early 2008, Spencer found herself in election-year controversy when questions were raised about her conduct in the city’s role in relocating a homeless shelter from downtown Huntsville to a residential district several miles away. Residents near the proposed new location complained that Spencer committed the city to the move without notice to them, and homeless advocates complained that the new location was too distant from other services used by the homeless.

==Return to private life==
Former Huntsville city councilman Tommy Battle announced that he would challenge Spencer in the 2008 mayoral election. Spencer announced that she would seek a fourth term in 2008. In the municipal election on August 26, 2008, Spencer led Battle by 14,871 votes to 14,486. However, two minor candidates received 673 votes, preventing Spencer from attaining a majority, forcing a runoff with Battle. In that runoff, on October 7, 2008, Battle decisively defeated Spencer, by a vote of 21,123 votes or 56 percent for Battle, to 16,821 or 44 percent for Spencer. In her concession speech, Spencer said, &quot;You have set the bar high with me. You bought into what we wanted to do, and I am so proud of you for it, because you don&#x27;t do it alone.&quot;

<doc id="986940" wikidata="Q3100989" url="?curid=986940" title="Chinese Immigration Act, 1923">
<text>The Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, also known as the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Act&quot; (the duration of which has been dubbed the Exclusion Era), was a Canadian Act of Parliament passed by the government of Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, banning most forms of Chinese immigration to Canada. Immigration from most countries was controlled or restricted in some way, but only the Chinese were completely prohibited from immigrating to Canada.

The act was repealed in May 1947 after World War II, due to Canada having been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==History==
Before 1923, Chinese immigration was heavily controlled by the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; of 1885, which imposed an onerous head tax on all immigrants from China.

After various members of the federal and some provincial governments (especially British Columbia) put pressure on the federal government to discourage Chinese immigration, the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; was passed. It went into effect on 1 July 1923. The Act banned immigrants of Chinese heritage from entering Canada except those under the following titles:

* Diplomat
* Foreign student
* &quot;Special circumstance&quot; granted by the Minister of Immigration under Article 9 of the Act (This is the class that former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson&#x27;s family fell under.)
* Merchant

Because Canada became a signatory following World War II of the United Nations&#x27; Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with which the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot; was inconsistent, the Canadian Parliament repealed the act on 14 May 1947 (following the proclamation of the &quot;Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946&quot; on 1 January 1947). However, independent Chinese immigration to Canada came only after the liberalization of Canadian immigration policy under the governments of John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson, first by the elimination of restrictions based on national origins in 1962, followed by the establishment of the world&#x27;s first points-based immigration system in 1967.

==Redress and legacy==
Since the 1 July Dominion Day holiday coincided with the enforcement of the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act&quot;, Chinese-Canadians at the time referred to the anniversary of Confederation as &quot;Humiliation Day&quot; and refused to take any part in the celebration.

On 22 June 2006, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized in the House of Commons. The first phrase of the apology was spoken in Cantonese Chinese, despite the overwhelming number of affected Chinese who are versed in the Taishanese dialect. He announced that the survivors or their spouses will be paid approximately $20,000 in compensation for the head tax.

On 15 May 2014, then-Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark apologized in the Legislative Assembly. The apology motion was unanimously passed and aims to make amends for historic wrongs. Unlike the federal apology, no individual compensation was provided. However, $1 million was promised to be put into a legacy fund which would help legacy initiatives. The formal apology went through a three-month consultation period with various parties to help ensure that the apology was done properly.

On 22 April 2018, then-Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia Gregor Robertson issued a formal public apology.

The Act and its legacy have been the subject of an acclaimed documentary film and work of historical fiction:

* &quot;Lost Years: A People&#x27;s Struggle for Justice&quot; (2011) by Kenda Gee and Tom Radford
* &quot;The Red Tiger&quot; (2019) by Chuck Lim 
The centenary of the bill&#x27;s commencement was marked on 1 July 2023; a national remembrance ceremony was held by the Senate on 23 June, while proclamations and memorial ceremonies were held in communities such as Calgary and Halifax. The newly-founded Chinese Canadian Museum in Vancouver also opened to the public that day.

<doc id="986944" wikidata="Q1559974" url="?curid=986944" title="Hurricane Carla">
<text>Hurricane Carla was the most intense tropical cyclone landfall in Texas in the 20th century. The third named storm of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3. As a tropical depression, it strengthened while heading northwest. The system was upgraded to a tropical storm on September 5 and reached hurricane intensity on September 6. On September 7, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico, passing northeast of the Yucatán Peninsula. On the morning of September 11, Carla became a category 4 hurricane when winds reached 130 mph (282 km/h). Carla made landfall at 2 p.m. on September 11 near Port O&#x27;Connor, Texas as a category 4 hurricane with a peak intensity of 145 mph (125 knots). Traveling inland, the storm was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13, while centered over southern Oklahoma. Carla&#x27;s remnants reached the Labrador Sea, Canada and dissipated on September 17, 1961.

While crossing the Yucatán Channel, the outer bands of Carla brought high winds and local flooding in western Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula. In Texas, wind gusts as high as were observed in Port Lavaca. Tornadoes spawned in the state, including an F4 tornado near Galveston, Texas, resulting in 60 buildings destroyed, eight deaths and 200 injuries. 

Throughout the state, Carla destroyed 1,915 homes, 568 farm buildings, and 415 other buildings. Additionally, 50,723 homes, 5,620 farm buildings, and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage. There were 34 fatalities and at least $300 million in losses in Texas. Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana, causing the destruction of 140 homes and 11 farms and other buildings, and major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings. Minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748 homes and 75 farms and other buildings. Six deaths and $25 million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla. Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states, especially in Kansas, where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned five people. Overall, Carla resulted in $325.74 million in losses and 43 fatalities.

==Meteorological history==

As early as September 1, a tropical disturbance – an area of convective activity – was observed tracking westward across the Caribbean Sea within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, an anticyclone was situated over the western Caribbean Sea at the upper-tropospheric levels. Surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on September 3. Thus, it is estimated that a tropical depression – a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than – developed about northwest of Barranquilla, Colombia at 1200 UTC. Initially, the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data. At San Andrés, winds shifted west at about , while barometric pressures dropped to . The Weather Bureau Office in Miami, Florida issued its first bulletin at 1600 UTC on September 4, while the depression was centered about east-southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua.

It is estimated that sustained winds reached at 1200 UTC on September 5, thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named &quot;Carla&quot;, while located just northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. A reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that Carla was continuing to intensify, with surface winds of . Radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone, with convective bands extending about outward from the center. Around 0000 UTC on September 6, Carla passed near Swan Island, which reported a barometric pressure of about and wind gusts of from the southwest. Based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100 UTC on September 6 – namely a barometric pressure of – a bulletin issued by the Weather Bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had &quot;probably reached hurricane intensity&quot;. According to post-season analysis, Carla reached hurricane status at that time. 

Shortly after becoming a hurricane on September 6, Carla curved northward in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. At 1200 UTC on September 7, the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane while located east-northeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico (actual use of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which was developed in 1971, was not in effect). Shortly thereafter, Carla crossed the Yucatán Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico. A strong high-pressure area forced Carla to resume its original northwesterly course. Early on September 8, the storm strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane while located just north of the Yucatán Peninsula. Thus, Carla was the third major hurricane of the season. Carla was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 10, while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. Operationally, at 0000 UTC on September 11, Carla strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane while located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Six hours later, the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of . However, a 2018 reanalysis concluded that Carla did not reach Category 5 intensity, and in fact only had maximum sustained winds of , and this has been officially incorporated into HURDAT.

Late on September 11, Carla reached its minimum barometric pressure of . Later that day, the storm struck Matagorda Island, Texas (seven miles south of Port O&#x27;Connor) with winds of . Carla rapidly weakened inland, and degenerated to a Category 2 hurricane on September 12, while passing just east of Port Lavaca. Six hours later, the storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane near Shiner, shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm between Taylor and Coupland. Beginning late on September 12, the storm curved just east of due north. After reaching Oklahoma early on September 13, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located over rural Johnston County. The extratropical remnants of Carla moved rapidly northeastward and brought heavy rainfall to some areas of the Great Plains and Midwestern United States. By September 14, it entered Canada near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It then continued swiftly northeastward across Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador, before the remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea on September 17.

==Preparations==
Occurring a year after Hurricane Donna, officials in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September 7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September 8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600 UTC on September 9. An estimated 500,000 people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation in the history of the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90–100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall.

==Impact==
Carla spawned 21 tornadoes, the largest hurricane-related tornado outbreak on record at the time. However, it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, which spawned at least 120 tornadoes. Throughout its path, 43 fatalities and about $325.74 million in damage were attributed to Carla. Most of the impact occurred in Texas, where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category 4 hurricane.

===United States===
====Texas====

Abnormally high tides and storm surge was reported along the coast of Texas, reaching at least above mean sea level at many coastal areas between Sabine Pass and Port Aransas. The highest tide reported was at Port Lavaca, with large wave heights including in Matagorda, in Port Aransas, in Freeport, in Texas City, and in Galveston and Sabine. Because the storm was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, Carla produced strong winds, especially near its path. The strongest sustained winds include in Matagorda, in Victoria, and . Additionally, the highest wind gust observations include in Port Lavaca, in Matagorda, and in Aransas Pass, Austwell, Edna, Port Aransas, and Victoria. Carla produced heavy rainfall in Texas, peaking at in Bay City. Other significant precipitation totals include at Scholes International Airport at Galveston, in Downtown Galveston, in Wharton, in Liberty, in Dickinson, in Flatonia, in Columbus, in Hallettsville, and in Smithville.

The most significant property damage occurred between Port Arthur and Corpus Christi. Port O&#x27;Connor, lying nearest to the location of Carla&#x27;s landfall, was virtually destroyed. In Columbus, the &quot;Ranch Drive-In&quot; theater is destroyed by the storm and was never reopened after 6 years of operation. In Victoria, the highest sustained wind speed was , while gusts reached . About 4,260 homes were damaged, with around 500 severely damaged or destroyed. 43 businesses and 26 public buildings were also significantly impacted. Damage in the city of Victoria reached $10 million. Of the 21 tornadoes spawned by Carla, eight of them in Texas caused significant impact. On September 11, an F2 tornado near Bay City destroyed two radio towers and damaged several buildings. An F3 tornado injured three people and caused the destruction of one house and impacted three others in Jacksonville, resulting in $25,000 in damage. Another F3 tornado in Channelview, located east of Houston, injured 22 people, destroyed 18 homes and six commercial buildings, damaged 40 additional homes, and caused $200,000 in damage. In the early morning hours of September 12, a violent F4 tornado moved across Galveston Island along a 1-mile long, 100-yard-wide path (it crossed into Galveston Bay as well), severely damaging 200 buildings, of which 60-75 were destroyed, and causing eight deaths and 200 injuries. This was the first of only two known violent tornadoes ever spawned by a hurricane with the other one happening during Hurricane Hilda in 1964. A few hours later, an F3 tornado in the area destroyed six houses and extensive, but lesser, damage. In Hardin, another F3 tornado damaged six homes. Several structures sustained impact during yet another F3 tornado in Fulbright. The final tornado occurred during the late afternoon hours of September 13 in Latex. It caused F2 damage, two injuries, and resulted in $2,500 in losses after damaging two houses and three garages.

Then little-known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the weather bureau building in Galveston during the storm, live on-site storm coverage that would be imitated by later reporters. This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane. Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that &quot;literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes&quot;, according to a fellow reporter. Broadcasting live at the Weather Bureau Office in Galveston, Rather asked a meteorologist to outline the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic. He then held the map over the black and white radar screen, which put the size of Carla into perspective, saying that Carla was the size of the Gulf of Mexico. CBS was so impressed with Rather&#x27;s work that he was offered the position of correspondent. Throughout Texas, Carla destroyed 1,915 homes, 568 farm buildings, and 415 other buildings. Additionally, 50,723 homes, 5,620 farm buildings, and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage. There were 460 injuries according to the American Red Cross, though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number, 465. The storm caused 34 fatalities in Texas. Causes of death include 20 people drowning, eight from tornadoes, four electrocutions, and one heart attack. Overall, damage in the state was &quot;conservatively&quot; estimated at $300 million. A breakdown of damage indicates $200 million incurred to property and $100 million to crops, mostly from unharvested rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus.

====Louisiana====

We have suffered hurricane, tornado, and floods, but we in Texas are a bold and brave people.&quot; After his report to President John F. Kennedy and Congress, $55 million was approved in aid for Texas, though Kennedy later requested an additional $65 million. President Kennedy issued a disaster declaration for Texas, allowing all jurisdictions in the state to apply for public assistance. The president also declared 6 parishes in Louisiana a disaster area. Helicopters deployed 88 United States Marines to Galveston to patrol devastated areas. A United States Navy task force composed of medical and construction work teams was also sent to the area. Members of the United States National Guard assisted refugees in returning to their homes and worked to prevent looting.

Owing to the hurricane&#x27;s intensity and destruction, the name Carla was retired after his season, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Carol for the 1965 season.

<text>James Michael Tyler (May 28, 1962 – October 24, 2021) was an American actor best known for portraying Gunther on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. Prior to acting, he was an assistant film editor and production assistant. His early works included being the production assistant for &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;. He also portrayed Oscar Bevins in the 1997 thriller film &quot;Motel Blue&quot;.

==Early life==
James Michael Tyler was born on May 28, 1962, the youngest of five children, in either Greenwood, Mississippi or Winona, Mississippi.

When Tyler was ten years old, his father, a former USAF captain, died. Just one year later, when Tyler was age eleven, his mother died. Afterwards, Tyler moved to Anderson, South Carolina to live with his sister. Tyler graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1980.

He graduated from Anderson College (now Anderson University) in 1982 with a two-year Associate&#x27;s degree and subsequently graduated from Clemson University with a degree in geology in 1984. During his time at Clemson, he was a member of a student theatre group, the Clemson Players. This experience sparked his interest in becoming an actor. He received his Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Georgia in 1987.

==Career==
In 1988, he moved to Los Angeles and became an assistant film editor and production assistant. The same year, he was a production assistant on the film &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot;. In L.A., he also worked at Guitar Center and a coffee shop called the Bourgeois Pig. It was here that he met his first wife, Barbara Chadsey, whom he married in 1995.

From 1994 to 2004, James Michael Tyler played Gunther on the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. Gunther was a coffee shop worker at Central Perk who had unrequited love for Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston. His real-life experience as a barista gave an assistant director on &quot;Friends&quot; the idea to put him behind the counter of Central Perk to make the set seem more &quot;authentic&quot;. This led to a ten-year career with appearances in 148 of &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; 236 episodes; he is the show&#x27;s most-frequently-appearing recurring character actor.

The night before his first appearance on &quot;Friends,&quot; a hair-stylist friend asked if he could practice bleaching on Tyler&#x27;s hair. Tyler agreed, and the makers of &quot;Friends&quot; loved it so much that what should have been a one-off look ended up becoming part of his character. He ended up having to bleach his hair every week for ten years. 

In honor of &quot;Friends&quot;″ 15th anniversary in 2009, Tyler officially opened the temporary Central Perk pop-up replica in London. It was open for two weeks from September to October and fans could apply for tickets to receive a free coffee and see memorabilia from the show. He appeared in the unaired pilot satire sitcom &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Watching&quot;, playing himself on the set of Central Perk.

In honor of &quot;Friends&quot;″ 20th anniversary in 2014, Tyler made appearances at a Central Perk replica in SoHo.

Tyler appeared in the BBC/Showtime sitcom &quot;Episodes&quot; (Series 2, Episode 6) as himself playing an ice hockey coach, when Matt LeBlanc tries unsuccessfully to get the other main stars from &quot;Friends&quot; to appear in the promotional video for the fictional television show &quot;Pucks&quot;.

He supported the Lili Claire Foundation and AIDS Project Los Angeles charities.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Tyler married Barbara Chadsey. The couple separated in 2003, and in 2014, he filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. He married Jennifer Carno in 2017.

==Death==
Tyler was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, but did not publicly disclose his illness until June 2021, shortly after the release of &quot;&quot;. The cancer metastasized to his spine, leading him to use a wheelchair. He died of complications from the disease at his home in Los Angeles, California, on October 24, 2021, at the age of 59.

===Music video===
==&quot;If You Knew&quot; spoken word performance==
In July 2021, producers Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise, along with two-time Emmy Nominee Tim Labonte and Grammy Award winner Alan Boyd, conceptualized and created a short film for Tyler&#x27;s spoken word performance entitled &quot;If You Knew&quot;. 

Tyler&#x27;s recording had been featured on a 2016 tribute album to The Beach Boys&#x27; lyricist Stephen Kalinich called &quot;Be Still&quot; that Gomes, Watrous, and Boyd had also produced. The Recording Academy placed the collection on the Official Ballot for the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album. Tyler also composed the music for the recording.
The new video for &quot;If You Knew&quot; was produced to honor Tyler and also create a fundraiser for the organization that was working closely with him, the Prostate Cancer Foundation. All the streaming proceeds of the video, and Tyler&#x27;s original recording, are being donated to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

<text>This is a list of English [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]].

==Prototypical prepositions==
The following are single-word prepositions that can take a noun phrase complement following the preposition. Prepositions in this section may also take other kinds of complements in addition to noun phrase complements. Prepositions marked with an asterisk can be used transitively or intransitively; that is, they can take noun phrase complements (e.g., &quot;he was in the house&quot;) or not (e.g., &quot;he was in&quot;).

== Intransitive prepositions ==
The following are single-word intransitive prepositions. This portion of the list includes only prepositions that are always intransitive; prepositions that can occur with or without noun phrase complements (that is, transitively or intransitively) are listed with the prototypical prepositions. Note that dictionaries and grammars informed by concepts from traditional grammar may categorize these intransitive prepositions as adverbs.

== Conjunctive prepositions ==
The following are single-word prepositions that take clauses as complements. Prepositions marked with an asterisk in this section can only take non-finite clauses as complements. Note that dictionaries and grammars informed by concepts from traditional grammar may categorize these conjunctive prepositions as subordinating conjunctions.

== Postpositions ==
The following are postpositions, prepositions whose complements typically precede them. Note that some grammars classify prepositions and postpositions as different kinds of adpositions while other grammars categorize both under the heading of the more common variety in the language.
*
* (&quot;archaic&quot;)
*
* (also prepositional)
* (usually prepositional but occurs in phrases like &quot;ten years on&quot;)
* (usually prepositional but occurs in phrases like &quot;the world over&quot;)
* (also prepositional)
* (usually prepositional but occurs in phrases like &quot;the whole day through&quot;)

==Complex prepositions==
The following are prepositions that consist of multiple words. They are categorized according to their structure.

===Preposition + preposition===
* 
* 
* 
* (&quot;formal&quot;)
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* (&quot;informal&quot;)
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 


===Preposition + (article) + noun + preposition===
English has many idiomatic expressions that act as prepositions that can be analyzed as a preposition followed by a noun (sometimes preceded by the definite or, occasionally, indefinite article) followed by another preposition. Common examples include:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
===Other complex prepositions===
The following complex prepositions do not follow either of the common structures for complex prepositions.

* (or &quot;a la&quot;)
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
==Archaic, dialectal, or specialized==
The following prepositions are not widely used in Present-Day English. Some, such as &quot;bating&quot; and &quot;forby&quot;, are archaic and typically only used to convey the tone of a bygone era. Others, such as &quot;ayond&quot; and &quot;side&quot;, are generally used only by speakers of a particular variety of English. Yet others are generally only used in specialized contexts, such as &quot;abaft&quot; in nautical settings and &quot;dehors&quot; in law.

==Plot==
=== Series overview ===
===Season 1===
Bernardo Elizondo owns a ranch where he lives with his wife, Doña Gabriela; his daughters, Norma, Jimena, and Sara; Norma&#x27;s husband, Fernando Escandón; and his father-in-law, Don Martín Acevedo, a retired and paralyzed military officer.

Norma and Fernando&#x27;s marriage was arranged by Doña Gabriela to hide the fact that Norma had been a victim of rape. However, the marriage is in name only and has not been consummated due to Norma&#x27;s trauma. Furthermore, Gabriela is in love with Fernando, which is why she forces her daughter to marry him to keep him close.

Although Bernardo is in love with Libia Reyes, a humble young woman, he knows he cannot marry her because Gabriela, a despotic and old-fashioned woman, would never grant him a divorce. Despite this, Bernardo is determined to break away from everything to live his love with Libia and decides to formally introduce himself to the young woman&#x27;s brothers: Juan, Óscar, and Franco Reyes. Although they initially disapprove of the relationship, they eventually accept it, considering that their sister&#x27;s happiness depends on it.

Unfortunately, Bernardo has a horseback riding accident and dies. At the same time, Libia discovers she is pregnant and, upon learning of Bernardo&#x27;s death, decides to go to the Elizondo house to claim the money that is rightfully hers. However, she is frightened and unsure whether she should go. When she finally arrives at the ranch, Doña Gabriela humiliates and scorns her family. Desperate, Libia flees and ends up committing suicide by jumping off a bridge.

When the Reyes brothers learn what happened, they vow to avenge their sister&#x27;s death. To do so, they go to the Elizondo ranch, posing as construction workers hired by Doña Gabriela to build a cabin intended for Norma and Fernando. This plan is made possible with the help of Eva Rodríguez, the Elizondos&#x27; housekeeper, who also seeks revenge against Gabriela, as she was forced to give up her only daughter, Ruth, for lacking the means to support her.

Upon meeting the Elizondo sisters, Óscar Reyes tries to convince his brothers to abandon their plans for revenge and instead seduce the sisters to &quot;pay them back in kind.&quot; However, his true intention is to obtain the Elizondos&#x27; money to improve his financial situation. His brother Juan disagrees with this plan but changes his mind after meeting Norma, as the two feel an immediate attraction.

This attraction makes Juan completely forget his plans for revenge, although the relationship between him and Norma will face numerous obstacles that they must overcome together.

===Season 2===
Twenty years after coming together, the life of the Reyes Elizondo family is prosperous and peaceful. The family known as one of the most influential in the city of San Marcos, where they live and do business. However, their idyllic life shatters after Erick and León Reyes, the twin sons of Juan and Norma, are accused of murder. This accusation is only the first of a series of successive events that arrive to disrupt the lives of Juan &amp; Norma, Oscar &amp; Jimena, Franco &amp; Sara. The new generations of Reyes, the now-grown children of the respective couples, will also face challenges that will change their lives forever.

<doc id="986986" wikidata="Q1638597" url="?curid=986986" title="Hurricane Hattie">
<text>Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching peak intensity as a Category5 hurricane. The ninth tropical storm, seventh hurricane, fifth major hurricane, and second Category 5 of the season, Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of . It weakened to Category4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November1.

Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to on Grand Cayman. The country of Belize, at the time known as British Honduras, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane. The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge. The territory governor estimated that 70% of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000 people homeless. The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. Overall, Hattie caused about $60 million in losses and 307 deaths in the territory. Although damage from Hattie was heavier than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people, the death toll from Hattie was considerably lower as a result of early warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 12 people.

==Meteorological history==

For a few days toward the end of October 1961, a low-pressure area persisted in the western Caribbean Sea, north of the Panama Canal Zone. On October 25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low; the next day, a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance. At 0000 UTC on October 27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of . Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of . The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about southeast of San Andres, or east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.

After being classified, Hattie moved steadily northward, passing very near or over San Andres Island. A station on the island recorded a pressure of and sustained winds of , which indicated that Hattie had reached hurricane status. Late on October 28, a Hurricane Hunters flight encountered a much stronger hurricane, with winds of in a small area near the center. At the time, gale-force winds extended outward to the northeast and to the southwest. Early on October 29, a trough extending from Nicaragua to Florida was expected to allow Hattie to continue northward, based on climatology for similar hurricanes. Later that day, Hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the Cayman Islands and western Cuba. Around that time, a strengthening ridge to the north turned the hurricane northwestward, which spared the Greater Antilles but increased the threat to Central America.

With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24 hours. Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on October 29, the center of the hurricane passed about southwest of Grand Cayman, at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around across Florida. Early on October 30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of . The storm&#x27;s minimum central pressure continued to drop throughout the day, reaching by 1300 UTC; a lower pressure of was computed at 1700 UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters. Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the Swan Islands. Late on October 30, Hattie attained peak winds of , concomitantly with a minimum central pressure of , about east of the border of Mexico and British Honduras. This made Hattie a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a reanalysis of the 1932 season revealed that Hurricane Fourteen had a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie. Additionally, Hattie was the strongest October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

Hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of Belize City on October 31, with an eyewall of about in diameter. Based on a post-season analysis, it was determined that Hattie had weakened to winds of before moving ashore. During landfall, a ship anchored between Belize City and Stann Creek registered a minimum central pressure of . The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November1 as it moved into the mountains of Guatemala. During its dissipation, Tropical Storm Simone was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala, however, later analysis concluded that Simone was not a tropical cyclone at all. Later, Tropical Storm Inga formed from a complex interaction with the remnants of Hattie and nearby disturbed weather.

==Preparations==
Upon initiating advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau noted the potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small vessels to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.

Hurricane Hattie first posed a threat to the Yucatán Peninsula and British Honduras on October 30 when it turned toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the potential for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

==Impact==

Despite predictions for heavy rainfall in the southwestern Caribbean, the hurricane&#x27;s movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast than anticipated. In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck San Andrés Island, located offshore eastern Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of and gusts of . As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner &quot;Admirar&quot;, anchored in one of the island&#x27;s bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961 USD) in San Andrés. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south.

In the northwestern Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least of rain were reported on the island, including in six hours. Winds on Grand Cayman were below hurricane force, and only minor damage occurred due to the rain.

The interaction between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of across most of Florida, with a gust of reported at Hillsboro Inlet Light; the winds caused some beach erosion in the state. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to Brunswick, Georgia.

Later, Hattie impacted various countries in Central America with flash floods, causing 11 deaths in Guatemala and one fatality in Honduras. The Swan Islands reported wind gusts just below hurricane force, resulting in minor damage and one injury.

===British Honduras===
Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide of up to 14 feet (4.3m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000 people located at sea level; its only defenses against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10 ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over , and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as . When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm.
High winds caused a power outage, downed trees across the region, and destroyed the roofs of many buildings. Governor Colin Thornley estimated that more than 70% of the buildings in the territory were damaged, and more than 10,000 people were left homeless. Some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane. The hurricane destroyed the wall at an insane asylum, which allowed the residents to escape. High waves damaged a prison, prompting officials to institute a &quot;daily parole&quot; program for the inmates. Hattie also flooded the Government House, washing away all records. All of Belize City was coated in a layer of mud and debris, and majority of the city was destroyed or severely damaged, as was nearby Stann Creek. The hurricane left significant crop damage across the region, including $2million in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber, cocoa, and bananas. The year&#x27;s production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged. About 70% of the territory&#x27;s mahogany trees were downed, as were most citrus and grapefruit trees. The hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region. Damage throughout the territory totaled $60 million (1961 USD), and a total of 307 deaths were reported; more than 100 of the fatalities were in Belize City, including 36 who evacuated to a British administration building that was later destroyed in the storm. The government of British Honduras considered Hurricane Hattie more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people; the lower death toll of Hattie was due to advance warning.

==Aftermath==

After Hattie struck, officials in Belize City declared martial law. A manager of United Press International described Belize City as &quot;nothing but a huge pile of matchsticks,&quot; and many roads were either flooded for days or covered with mud. Doctors provided typhoid vaccinations to 12,000 residents in two days to prevent the spread of the disease. Due to the high death toll, officials ordered mass cremations to stop additional disease from spreading. At the city&#x27;s police station, workers provided fresh water and rice to storm victims. Many residents throughout British Honduras donated supplies to the storm victims, such that an airlines manager described it as &quot;taxing... manpower and facilities.&quot; One airline allowed donations to be flown to Belize City at no cost. The city&#x27;s three newspapers were unable to operate due to lack of power after the storm. By November5, Belize City&#x27;s post office reopened on a limited basis, and all business initially remained closed. About 4,000 homeless residents from Stann Creek were moved by boat to the northern portion of the territory. Many homeless people from the Belize City area set up a tent city on bushland about inland, which was initially intended to be temporary. In December 1961, barracks were erected near a Red Cross Hospital to house the homeless in the camp. The site was named Hattieville and became a proper city, with utilities installed in the subsequent decade.

About 200 British soldiers arrived from Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order. At least 20 people were arrested in the day after Hattie struck. The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide £10,000 in aid. The Save the Children fund sent £1,000 to British Honduras, and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory. Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance. The USS &quot;Antietam&quot; remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six Marine helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide of food. The United States government allocated about $300,000 in assistance through the International Development Association. The Canadian government provided C$75,000 worth of aid, including food, blankets, and medical supplies.

In 1962, Jimmy Cliff released his breakthrough single, &quot;Hurricane Hattie&quot;. By Hattie&#x27;s one year anniversary, private and public workers repaired and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20 million in loans. In the days after the storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.

Due to the destruction and loss of life attributed to the hurricane, the name Hattie was retired by the weather Bureau following the season, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Holly for the 1965 season.

<text>Charlie Hunter Trio is the debut album by jazz guitarist Charlie Hunter. It was released by Prawn Song Records, a label owned by Les Claypool. Claypool produced the album, and his former bandmate, Jay Lane, played drums. Dave Ellis joined in on saxophone. Hunter played a seven-string guitar.

==Production==
The album was recorded by Claypool for one hundred dollars.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic wrote that &quot;the trio provides an interesting, yet accessible, groove-driven, funky, improvised jam for a new generation of jazz fans.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;Though deceptively clean, its diffuse, fusiony compositions don’t fully convey the group’s sass and spirit — only &#x27;Dance of the Jazz Fascists&#x27; ... comes close.&quot;

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
* Charlie Hunter – seven-string guitar
* Scott Jensen – trumpet
* Dave Ellis – tenor saxophone
* Miles Perkins – double bass
* Jay Lane – drums
* Scott Roberts – congas
* Andre Marshall – bells, cow bell

<text>CSS &quot;Charleston&quot; was a casemate ironclad ram built for the Confederate Navy (CSN) at Charleston, South Carolina during the American Civil War. Funded by the State of South Carolina as well as donations by patriotic women&#x27;s associations in the city, she was turned over to the Confederate Navy and defended the city until advancing Union troops that threatened Charleston caused her to be destroyed in early 1865 lest she be captured. Her wreck was salvaged after the war and the remains have been obliterated by subsequent dredging.

==Construction and description==
James M. Eason was awarded a contract by the State of South Carolina to build a larger ironclad at Charleston in November 1862 after he finished the casemate ram . Funds were also contributed by the city&#x27;s &quot;Ladies&#x27; Gun-boat Association&quot;, which led to &quot;Charleston&quot;″s nickname of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Gunboat&quot;. He began construction the next month and completed the ship in September 1863.

&quot;Charleston&quot; was long overall and had a beam of . Her depth of hold was and she had a draft . The ship had a displacement of . &quot;Charleston&quot;″s propulsion system is unknown, but her engine had a diameter of and her propeller was in diameter. At any rate, she was credited with a speed of . The ship was armed with two smoothbore guns at the ends of the ship, probably Dahlgren guns, and four muzzle-loading Brooke rifles on the broadside that fired projectiles, which would make them guns although their exact type is unknown. &quot;Charleston&quot; was also fitted with a wrought-iron ram. The ship&#x27;s armor was thick. All together, her ram and armor weighed . Her crew numbered 150 officers and enlisted men.

==Service==
Once completed, &quot;Charleston&quot; served as the flagship of the CSN&#x27;s Charleston Squadron together with the rams and &quot;Chicora&quot;. Her only captain was Commander Isaac N. Brown. The ship was set on fire and blown up with of gunpowder in the Cooper River on the night of 17/18 February 1865 to prevent her capture by the Union Army once the city was evacuated by the Confederates. The wreck was salvaged to a depth of below low water by Benjamin Maillefort in 1872–73 and the site has been thoroughly dredged to deepen the channel, destroying any remains. Its last known location was at

<text>George Clifton James (May 29, 1920 – April 15, 2017) was an American actor known for roles as a prison floorwalker in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967), Sheriff J.W. Pepper alongside Roger Moore in the James Bond films &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), the sheriff in &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976), a Texas tycoon in &quot;The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training&quot; (1977), and the owner of the scandalous 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team in &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
James was born in Spokane, Washington, the son of Grace (née Dean), a teacher, and Harry James, a journalist. He grew up in Oregon in the Gladstone area of Clackamas County.

James was a decorated World War II United States Army veteran. He served as an infantry platoon sergeant with Co. &quot;A&quot; 163rd Infantry, 41st Division. He served forty-two months in the South Pacific from January 1942 until August 1945. His decorations include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.

==Career==
James became well known for playing the comic-relief role of Louisiana Sheriff J.W. Pepper in the James Bond films &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Man With The Golden Gun&quot; (1974). He played very similar characters in both &quot;Silver Streak&quot; (1976) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980). Years earlier he portrayed a serious character in &quot;The Reivers&quot; (1969), opposite Steve McQueen, playing a mean, corrupt country sheriff. Two years earlier he had portrayed a hard-nosed Southern prison floor-walker in &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; (1967). In &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974) he portrayed one of the first passengers aboard a luxury liner to realize there was a serious problem with the ship.

James appeared in the uncredited role of the district attorney who prosecuted Al Capone in the film &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987). He played a Navy master-at-arms in &quot;The Last Detail&quot; (1973), starring Jack Nicholson, and Chicago White Sox baseball team owner Charles Comiskey in &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988), a drama about the corrupt 1919 Chicago White Sox.

Despite being born in the Northwest and spending much of his life in New York (where he was an Actors Studio member of long standing), James was cast as a Southerner in many of his screen roles, such as his appearances in the James Bond films, and as powerful Houston lawyer Striker Bellman in the daytime soap opera &quot;Texas&quot; from 1981 to 1982.

In 1965, he played “Sam Hare”, a slimy, blackmailing salesman on the TV Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in the episode “The Lady” (S10E27). He guest-starred again as Tenner Jackson, a successful poker player later killed for his winnings in the episode “The Wrong Man” - alongside Carroll O’Connor (S12E7). Later, he played the train passenger Wilkes on the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episode &quot;Snow Train&quot; (1970).

James again portrayed a Southern character when he played Sheriff Lester Crabb, a temporary one-off replacement for regular Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) in the second-season &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot; episode &quot;Treasure of Hazzard&quot; (1980). He appeared on 13 episodes of the sitcom &quot;Lewis &amp; Clark&quot; in 1981–1982. Other television credits include the 1976 private-eye drama &quot;City of Angels&quot; and the miniseries &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1976). He appeared in two episodes of &quot;The A-Team&quot;: as murderous prison warden Beale in the first-season episode &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; (1983) and as corrupt Sheriff Jake Dawson in the second season&#x27;s &quot;The White Ballot&quot; (1983). In 1996, he played the role of Red Kilgreen on &quot;All My Children&quot;. James appeared in the 1979 pilot episode of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; playing the part of a highway cop. 

His other film roles include those of a wealthy Montana land baron whose cattle are being rustled in &quot;Rancho Deluxe&quot; (1975) and as the source who tips off a newspaperman to a potentially explosive story in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990). James was featured a number of times by writer-director John Sayles, including &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988), &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sunshine State&quot; (2002).

James&#x27; last known film appearance was in &quot;Raising Flagg&quot; (2006), although he had been cast in a starring role to appear in the feature film &quot;Old Soldiers&quot;, playing a true-to-life elderly veteran of World War II. Production on that film was halted in 2016.

==Personal life==
James married twice: to Donna Lea Beach from 1948 to 1950, with whom he had one child, and to Laurie Harper, from 1951 until her death in 2015, with whom he had five children. He resided in Gladstone, Oregon, and died from complications of diabetes on April 15, 2017, aged 96.

<text>Muchachitas (English title: &quot;Girls&quot;) is a Mexican telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa for Televisa in 1991. The telenovela was also shown on Univisión in the early 1990s.

It stars Alejandro Camacho, Cecilia Tijerina, Tiaré Scanda, Emma Laura, Kate del Castillo and Laura León.

==Plot==
Four girls (Mónica, Elena, Leticia and Isabel) enroll in an art academy to pursue their dreams of careers in acting and singing. The four are from different backgrounds:

*Monica is wealthy but humble and sweet. She dates Rodrigo, who works under her father at their supermarket and drives a taxi on the side. When Rodrigo is framed by Monica&#x27;s cousin Federico and sent to jail for industrial espionage, she stands by him, but she cannot forget her previous boyfriend Roger, who was also the object of attempted murder by Federico.
*Elena is poor and tough. She was Rodrigo&#x27;s first girlfriend, but Rodrigo dumped her for Monica, causing a rift between the two girls. Later, however, it is revealed that Elena&#x27;s father is also Monica&#x27;s biological father; their respective mothers, also active in theater, had been friends and rivals.
*Isabel is middle-class and selfless. She lives with her widowed father. She gets involved with Pedro, who turns out to be married, but though Pedro&#x27;s terminally ill wife forgives her and entrusts her with the care of their daughter, Betty, she distrusts Pedro.
*Leticia is a middle-class social climber, who is not hesitant to speak her mind and to pretend to get on with rich men. She eventually &quot;marries&quot; Federico, not realizing that the wedding has no legal effect (the license was not properly filed). She is later sent to work for her grandmother, who was also once a social climber but has mellowed and grown wiser.

<doc id="987013" wikidata="Q6942413" url="?curid=987013" title="Music of the former Netherlands Antilles">
<text>The music of the former Netherlands Antilles is a mixture of native, African and European elements, and is closely connected with trends from neighboring countries such as Venezuela and Colombia and islands such as Puerto Rico, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Haiti, Martinique, Trinidad, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. The former Netherlands Antilles islands of Curaçao and Aruba are known for their typical waltzes, danzas, mazurkas and a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it.

The remaining islands are much smaller than Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao. They are Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Saba. Sint Eustatius has little nightlife, with only one nightclub (the zouk Largo Height Disco) as of 1996. The inhabitants, &quot;Statians&quot;, hold impromptu street dances called &quot;road blocks&quot;, using booming car stereos. Saba has a number of dances at various restaurants, including a wide variety of hip hop, calypso, soca, kompa, zouk, bouyon, reggae and merengue. Sint Maarten has a well-known Carnival tradition featuring music and dance, held in mid-April and culminating in the traditional burning of King Moui-Moui, as well as a number of nightclubs and casinos featuring music; popular &quot;spots&quot; where locals go to dance include Boo Boo Jam and Lago Height, both located on the northern (French) part of Sint Maarten; the most popular recent casino band is King Bo-Bo, known as the &quot;King of Calypso&quot;.

== Modern Aruban music ==
Music is very closely connected to the Aruban culture, and plays a major role in holidays, carnivals and informal celebrations. Carnival music originated in Trinidad in the late 18th century, and combines romantic themes, calypso-inspired tunes, and drums from tumba. Other Aruban celebrations that are based around music include Dera Gai, Dande, Gaita and Aguinaldo.

== Music of Curaçao ==
== Traditional music on Bonaire ==
The island of Bonaire is known for an array of dances, including the Bari and Simadan. Imported polka, carioca, rumba, merengue, danza, joropo, jazz waltz and mazurka are also popular. The Baile di Sinta is a popular fertility dance, performed around a maypole. Traditional African work songs on Bonaire evolved over time into ritual songs with complex dances, instrumentation and polyphony.

The Bari, performed during the festival of the same name, as well as at other times, is led by a single singer who improvises lyrics commenting on local events and figures (such a singer is similar to a calypsonian). Confusingly, the Bari dance, which is performed during the Bari festival, is accompanied by a bongo-like drum called a Bari. The first part of the dance features men competing in a stylized, ritual dance for women, followed by a part where the couples dance, though they don&#x27;t touch (it is similar to tumba).

After the sorghum harvest in February through April, the Simadan festival is held to celebrate, with the wapa, a rhythmic, shuffling dance, accompanying the celebration. Simadan&#x27;s traditional songs include three call-and-response forms, the Dan Simadan, Belua and Remailo. These use instruments including the bari, wiri, karko, quarta, guitar, triangle and clapping.

<text>In mathematics, a combinatorial class is a countable set of mathematical objects, together with a size function mapping each object to a non-negative integer, such that there are finitely many objects of each size.

==Counting sequences and isomorphism==
The &quot;counting sequence&quot; of a combinatorial class is the sequence of the numbers of elements of size &quot;i&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ...; it may also be described as a generating function that has these numbers as its coefficients. The counting sequences of combinatorial classes are the main subject of study of enumerative combinatorics. Two combinatorial classes are said to be isomorphic if they have the same numbers of objects of each size, or equivalently, if their counting sequences are the same. Frequently, once two combinatorial classes are known to be isomorphic, a bijective proof of this equivalence is sought; such a proof may be interpreted as showing that the objects in the two isomorphic classes are cryptomorphic to each other.

For instance, the triangulations of regular polygons (with size given by the number of sides of the polygon, and a fixed choice of polygon to triangulate for each size) and the set of unrooted binary plane trees (up to graph isomorphism, with a fixed ordering of the leaves, and with size given by the number of leaves) are both counted by the Catalan numbers, so they form isomorphic combinatorial classes. A bijective isomorphism in this case is given by planar graph duality: a triangulation can be transformed bijectively into a tree with a leaf for each polygon edge, an internal node for each triangle, and an edge for each two (polygon edges?) or triangles that are adjacent to each other.

==Analytic combinatorics==
The theory of combinatorial species and its extension to analytic combinatorics provide a language for describing many important combinatorial classes, constructing new classes from combinations of previously defined ones, and automatically deriving their counting sequences. For example, two combinatorial classes may be combined by disjoint union, or by a Cartesian product construction in which the objects are ordered pairs of one object from each of two classes, and the size function is the sum of the sizes of each object in the pair. These operations respectively form the addition and multiplication operations of a semiring on the family of (isomorphism equivalence classes of) combinatorial classes, in which the zero object is the empty combinatorial class, and the unit is the class whose only object is the empty set.

==Permutation patterns==
In the study of permutation patterns, a combinatorial class of permutation classes, enumerated by permutation length, is called a Wilf class. The study of enumerations of specific permutation classes has turned up unexpected equivalences in counting sequences of seemingly unrelated permutation classes.

<text>The music of Curaçao is known for typical waltzes, danzas, mazurkas and a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it.

== Classical and traditional music of Curaçao ==
The tumba is the most internationally renowned kind of Curaçao music. Tumba is the name of an African-derived rhythm, as are &quot;seú&quot; and tambú. The Curaçao-born composer Jan Gerard Palm (1831–1906) was the first composer to write music for the lyrics of tumba&#x27;s. There are traditional lyrics associated with different tumba songs, but they are sometimes scandalous and accusatory, and are thus not always sung. Tumba was known as early as the 19th century, and it is now a popular part of the Carnival Road March.

Besides tumbas, there is a very rich tradition of Antillean waltzes, mazurkas, danzas and pasillos that are popular in Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba. This music is often referred to as the Classical Music from Curaçao and Aruba. Well known composers of the Netherlands Antilles are Jan Gerard Palm (1831–1906), Chris Ulder (1843–1895), Joseph Sickman Corsen (1853–1911), Paul de Lima (1861–1926), Jacobo Conrad (1879–1918), Rudolph Palm (1880–1950), Charles Maduro (1883–1947), John Palm (1885–1925), Toni Palm (1885–1963), Jacobo Palm (1887–1982) Albert Palm (1903–1958), Edgar Palm (1905–1998), Wim Statius Muller (1930), Robert Rojer (1939) and Randal Corsen (b. 1972). Aruba is well known by its composers Rufo Wever (1917–1977) and Padu Lampe (b. 1925).

Traditional work songs were very diverse on Curaçao, where they were sung in seshi (semi-Papiamento) or Guene. Lyrics were apentatonic.

Tumba is the name of an African-derived rhythm, as are &quot;seú&quot; and tambú. Traditionally, Afro-Curaçaoan rhythms were often played in the &quot;muzik di zumbi&quot; style, which included instruments such as the benta (bow harp), gogorobi (rattlers) and flute, which created an ethereal sound.

Tambú (sometimes called the Curaçao blues) was first sung by slaves (mostly women) expressing pain and sadness, usually accompanied by the tambú drum and the &quot;agan&quot; (a piece of iron or ploughshare) or &quot;chapi&quot; (a hoe), along with clapping (usually only by the women in the audience).

Previously, drums were outlawed for slaves, and the &quot;bastèl&quot;, a large calabash in a water barrel, was used instead. It is accompanied by an erotic dance that involves no physical touching. The dance was so racy that the government and the Roman Catholic Church sought to end the practice.

The &quot;seú&quot; was performed during the harvest festival during traditional times, but is now continued during annual parades in the city of Willemstad. Formerly the seú was a march through the fields, during which the workers brought the crops to the warehouses, the men playing drums, kachu and chapi, while the women carried produce on their heads. It was accompanied by a dance called &quot;wapa&quot;, which gracefully re-enacted the movements associated with planting and harvesting, often including work songs in Guene, the old slave language. As traditional agriculture began dying out with modern industrialization, the seú too began to fade away. The Curaçao Department of Culture now organizes an annual parade in Willemstad on Easter Monday, which sees as many as 2500 people or more participate.

== Modern music on Curaçao ==
The local Papiamento (Papiamento Song) record industry emerged after the 1950s. Three men were instrumental in this renaissance: Jules de Palm, Rene de Rooy and Pierre Lauffer. They published under the pseudonym Julio Perennal, including a cancionero and a manifesto that called for more Papiamento songs to be written. Many did so, recording throughout the &#x27;50s in a mixture of styles, including Cuban and Dominican genres including son montuno, bolero, pambiche, merengue and guaracha. Nowadays the Tumba is especially popular particularly in the Carnival period. Also Ritmo Kombina (literally meaning &quot;combined rhythm&quot;) is a combination of different types of music. It is very popular among the young crowd in Curaçao and is played throughout the year.

<text>The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) is a regional educational accreditor recognized by the United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. As of 2022, the organization oversees approximately 750 public and private degree-granting educational institutions in the Southern United States. Its headquarters are in North Druid Hills, Georgia, near Decatur, in the Atlanta metropolitan area.

SACS accredits educational institutions in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, and educational institutions for U.S. students in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America.

There are a number of affiliate organizations within the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. One affiliate organization is the Southern Association of Community, Junior, and Technical Colleges.

==Commission on Colleges==
The first SACS was founded in 1895 and is made up of Council on Accreditation and School Improvement and the Commission on Colleges, which existed since 1912. It also works with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors.

The SACS Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredits universities and colleges in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Latin America (Extraterritorial).dead link

Every six months, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges publishes an online report on its accreditation actions, including reaffirmations of accreditation and public sanctions of institutions of higher learning. The reports include specific public sanctions of schools and statements disclosing why those institutions have been placed on sanction.

The Commission on Colleges accredits both public and private institutions of higher education in the United States, including some community colleges as well as four-year institutions. As a regional accreditor, SACSCOC accreditation extends to all of the educational programs offered at the accredited institution.

Institutions in Latin America accredited by SACSCOC include the Mexican universities of Fundación Universidad de las Américas, Puebla; Universidad de las Americas, A.C.; Universidad de Monterrey; Tecnológico de Monterrey; Instituto Centroamericano de Administración de Empresas (INCAE or the Central American Institute of Business Administration) in Costa Rica and Nicaragua; and Keiser University Latin American Campus in Nicaragua. The SACSCOC has also accredited the American University in Dubai and the American University of Ras Al Khaimah.

==Council on Accreditation and School Improvement==
SACS CASI accredits over 13,000 primary, middle, and secondary schools, and school systems located in the SACS region. In 2006, AdvancED was established with the unification of SACS CASI, NCA CASI, and NSSE. Today, SACS CASI acts as an accreditation division of AdvancED, now known as Cognia.

On December 9, 2018, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools had excluded Bennett College from its membership due to failure of completion of the chapter 13, section 1 of the Principles of Accreditation. During the same year, they have suspended membership of the Loyola University New Orleans for the same reason and set up special committees to Johnson University and Prairie View A&amp;M University for the full year. Due to this process, Memphis Theological Seminary was denied reaffirmation and was put on warning for a year, citing the lack of financial responsibilities and institutional planning.

The SACS had also put full year and half year warnings on the Denmark Technical and Roanoke–Chowan Community Colleges, citing lack of governing board characteristics, as well as financial federal and state responsibilities and conflict of interest, among others. The SACS also had denied faculty change to Ferrum College and a change from private to public to the Florida National University.

In 2018 a merger between College of Biblical Studies and Crossroads Bible College had been proposed and accepted with the common name of the institution will be College of Biblical Studies-Houston per Substantive Change Committee. During the same year, a merge between Keiser and Walford Universities was also called in. As of 2019, the institution is called Keiser University as was agreed upon by the Substantive Change Committee.

<text>Kallang ( is a planning area and residential zone located in the Central Region of Singapore.

Development of the town is centered around the Kallang River, the longest river in Singapore. Kallang Planning Area is bounded by Toa Payoh in the north, Geylang in the east, Marine Parade in the southeast, Marina East in the south, the Downtown Core in the southwest, Rochor, Newton in the west, and Novena in the northwest.

Throughout its history, Kallang was home to several national landmarks, some of which were built along the banks of the Kallang Basin, including the old National Stadium as well as the country&#x27;s first purpose-built civil airport, the Kallang Airport. The famous Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave have roots traced to the former National Stadium, which hosted 18 National Day Parades, as well as numerous notable cultural and sporting events. As such, Kallang played a pivotal role in Singapore&#x27;s aviation and sporting histories.

Today, Kallang is best known as the location of the Singapore Sports Hub, which is home to the new National Stadium and the Singapore Indoor Stadium. The new National Stadium hosted the National Day Parade in 2016, while the Singapore Indoor Stadium frequently hosts concerts and performances.

==Etymology==
The area of what is now Kallang first appeared in an 1830 survey map of Singapore as &quot;Kilang&quot;. By 1838, the place name was spelled as &quot;Kelang&quot;. The modern-day &quot;Kallang&quot; is in use since 1842, even though the alternative spelling &quot;Kalang&quot; is also utilised in some instances.

The Chinese and Tamil names for Kallang are &quot;加冷&quot; and &quot;காலாங்&quot; respectively. Both are direct transliterations of the English/Malay name. The Chinese word &quot;加冷&quot; is generally based on Cantonese (pronounced as &quot;加冷 gaa-laang&quot;) transliteration of the word &quot;Kallang&quot;. Kallang was also nicknamed &quot;火城&quot; (&quot;fire city&quot;) by the Chinese community because it was the site of the Kallang Gasworks.

==Geography==
===Location===
Situated towards the southeastern shore of Pulau Ujong, the perimeter of Kallang Planning Area is made up of Toa Payoh in the north, Geylang in the east, Marine Parade in the southeast, Marina East in the south, the Downtown Core in the southwest, Rochor and Newton in the west, as well as Novena in the northwest. Starting from the north in an anti-clockwise direction, the boundaries of Kallang Planning Area are marked by the Pan Island Expressway (PIE), Central Expressway (CTE), Bukit Timah Road, Tekka Lane, Northumberland Road, Gloucester Road, Race Course Road, Rangoon Road, Serangoon Road, Syed Alwi Road, Jalan Sultan, Beach Road, Ophir Road, East Coast Parkway (ECP), Fort Road, Mountbatten Road, and Sims Way. Kallang Planning Area is part of the Central Region of Singapore.

Although by definition a single &quot;planning area&quot; according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the Kallang/Whampoa New Town as per the Housing and Development Board (HDB) also includes the estate of Whampoa, located within Balestier subzone of the adjacent Novena Planning Area. Kallang/Whampoa is the only HDB town that spans across two separate planning areas.

===Statistics===
Occupying an area of 9.17 square kilometres, Kallang Planning Area is ranked 32nd among the 55 planning areas in terms of total area, ahead of Bukit Panjang Planning Area and behind Punggol Planning Area. It is ranked 18th in terms of population size, ahead of Queenstown Planning Area and behind Punggol Planning Area.

With an area of 7.99 square kilometres, Kallang/Whampoa New Town is ranked 9th among the 23 new towns in terms of total area, ahead of Bukit Batok New Town and behind Bukit Merah New Town.

===Subdivisions===
Kallang Planning Area consists of nine &quot;subzones&quot;, as officially established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for urban planning purpose.

It is noteworthy that while the Old Kallang Airport Estate along Old Airport Road and Dakota Crescent is often associated with Kallang for historical reasons, it is officially placed under the subzone of Aljunied, part of the adjacent Geylang Planning Area, for urban planning purpose.

Similarly, the industrial zone bounded by MacPherson Road, Aljunied Road, the Pelton Canal and Pan Island Expressway (PIE) is part of the Kallang Way subzone. Despite the name of this subzone, it is now part of Geylang. Previously, this area formed part of the now-defunct Kallang mukim.

The subzone of Farrer Park belongs to the adjacent Rochor Planning Area, even though the eponymous open field historically known as &quot;Farrer Park&quot; (now called &quot;Farrer Park Field&quot;) is located within Kallang.

While the subzones of Little India and Kampong Glam constitute parts of Rochor, many developments often associated with these two areas are located within Kallang, resulting in an &quot;overspill&quot; effect. &quot;Little India&quot; and &quot;Kampong Glam&quot; often refer to their respective cultural districts that are larger than the URA-defined subzones and extend into Kallang.

The subzone of Lorong 8 Toa Payoh was known as &quot;Kallang&quot;, possibly due to its location on either side of the Kallang River. The subzone was later renamed to its current name, taken after a nearby road of the same name, and is a constituent part of Toa Payoh Planning Area.

===Geology===
Kallang sits on the Kallang Formation which consists of soft marine clay, loose alluvial muddy sand, loose beach sand, soft peaty and organic mud, and coral. Aside from the eponymous Kallang, the Kallang Formation is also found in other parts of Singapore, particularly at river valleys, as well as around river mouths and coastal regions.

===Terrain===
The terrain of Kallang is generally flat and low, with elevation no more than 15 metres above sea level.

Though not located within Kallang Planning Area, the geographic point of Bukit Kallang (also spelt as &quot;Bukit Kalang&quot;) is a hill in the Central Water Catchment and has an elevation of 97 metres. Bukit Kallang is situated at the southeastern corner of the Upper Peirce Reservoir, west of the TreeTop Walk suspension bridge, and within the territory of the former Ulu Kallang mukim. The Bukit Kalang Service Reservoir maintained by the Public Utilities Board (PUB) is within its vicinity, so is the source of the Kallang River, the Lower Peirce Reservoir.

===Water bodies===


The Kallang River is the main waterway that meanders through Kallang. The source of the Kallang River is the Lower Peirce Reservoir (formerly known as the &quot;Kallang River Reservoir&quot;; renamed in honour of Municipal Engineer Robert Peirce in 1922) and the river mouth is located at Kallang Basin, near to the Merdeka Bridge. Flowing for more than 10 kilometres, the Kallang River is the longest river in Singapore and drains areas as far north as Bishan and Ang Mo Kio.

The Kallang Basin is an enclosed bay in Kallang, and is a popular location for water sports. The Singapore Sports Hub is located on the eastern bank of the Kallang Basin. In 1977, the Singapore government embarked on a ten-year-long clean-up project for the Kallang Basin and the nearby Singapore River, transforming them into the clean waterways of today. The Kallang Basin area used to form part of mainland Singapore&#x27;s southeastern coastline, as evident from the location of Beach Road. Kallang River used to empty into the Singapore Straits at Kallang Basin, as did Rochor River and Geylang River. One of the Republic of Singapore Navy&#x27;s (RSN) Bedok-class mine countermeasures vessel is named &quot;RSS &quot;Kallang&quot;&quot;, as part of a series of vessels named after Singapore&#x27;s coastal regions.

Kallang is also drained by the Geylang River, Rochor River, Rochor Canal, Marina Channel, Sungei Whampoa and the Pelton Canal, the latter two of which are tributaries of the Kallang River. These aforementioned waterways, together with the Singapore River and Marina Bay, make up the Marina Reservoir that has a catchment size of about one-sixth of mainland Singapore&#x27;s land area.

Kallang constitutes part of the Drainage Catchments of Bukit Timah, Geylang, Stamford Marina and Kallang, as per the Public Utilities Board (PUB). Kallang Drainage Catchment only extends into a small part of the Kallang Planning Area; it also encompasses areas belonging to the planning areas of Toa Payoh, Serangoon, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Central Water Catchment and Bukit Panjang.

Due to the high concentration of waterways in Kallang, many bridges were constructed to cross over these rivers and canals. Some famous bridges found in Kallang include the Merdeka Bridge, Benjamin Sheares Bridge (Singapore&#x27;s tallest and longest bridge; reaches its highest point of 29 metres at Kallang Basin) and the Tanjong Rhu Footbridge (the first suspension bridge in Singapore).

==History==
===Boundaries===
The present-day boundaries of Kallang Planning Area are established by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for urban planning purpose. Prior to the creation of &quot;planning areas&quot;, Singapore was divided into two types of survey districts by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA): &quot;mukim&quot; in rural areas and &quot;town subdivisions&quot; in the city. There were two mukim that bore the name &quot;Kallang&quot;: Kallang and Ulu Kallang.

====Kallang mukim====
The mukim of Kallang (alternatively spelled as &quot;Kalang&quot;) was roughly bounded by Upper Serangoon Road, Serangoon Road and the Kallang River to its west; Upper Paya Lebar Road to its north and east; Paya Lebar Road to its east; and Geylang Road to its south. The areas that once belonged to the former Kallang mukim are now split among the planning areas of Serangoon, Toa Payoh, Geylang and Kallang. On the other hand, the areas that now form Kallang Planning Area were shared by the now-dissolved mukims of Toa Payoh, Geylang (formerly spelled as &quot;Gelang&quot;), Kallang and various town subdivisions. The modern boundaries of Kallang Planning Area therefore differ from those of the Kallang mukim.

====Ulu Kallang mukim====
A vast region at the upstream of the Kallang River was part of the mukim of Ulu Kallang (also written as &quot;Ulu Kalang&quot;). &quot;Ulu&quot; is a Malay term which translates to &quot;rural&quot;, &quot;remote&quot;, &quot;upstream&quot; or &quot;origin&quot; – a reference to its location at the upper reaches of the Kallang River and its relative lack of development. Within the boundaries of Ulu Kallang were Upper Peirce Reservoir and Lower Peirce Reservoir. Ulu Kallang mukim bordered the adjacent mukims of Ulu Pandan in its southwest, Tanglin in its southeast, Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio in its east, South Seletar in its northeast, Mandai in its northwest, and Bukit Timah in its west. The territories which once constituted Ulu Kallang are now shared among the planning areas of Central Water Catchment, Bukit Timah and Bishan, the first of which remained as one of the least developed places in Singapore. In several historical maps, this mukim was labeled as &quot;Upper Kalang&quot;.

===Landscape===
The present landscape of Kallang is the result of extensive land reclamation carried out over multiple phases. Prior to land reclamation, the original southeastern shoreline of mainland Singapore was situated at the Kallang Basin area, near where Tanjong Rhu Road and Beach Road are today.

In August 1931, the Public Works Department was tasked to lead the land reclamation project at the eastern portion of the Kallang Basin for the construction of the Kallang Airport. A total of 339 acres of mangrove swamp was reclaimed, and the project cost was estimated at around 9 million Straits dollars. The land reclamation lasted from May 1932 to October 1936.

In June 1932, another land reclamation project began at Beach Road. The aim was to create a foreshore to the immediate south of Beach Road between Stamford Road and the Rochor River.

From 1963 to 1971, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) led a massive land reclamation project in the northern part of the Kallang Basin. The swamps and mudflats were filled in using earth sourced from the leveled hills of Toa Payoh. Before land reclamation, the Kallang Basin was a large swamp that stretched as far north as today&#x27;s Bendemeer Road at its greatest extent; numerous islands existed along the course of the Kallang River and its tributaries.

Between 1966 and 1975, the East Coast Reclamation Project led by HDB formed new lands at Tanjong Rhu in southern Kallang, as well as the adjacent communities in Marine Parade. In 1979, Phase VI of the project extended the Tanjong Rhu coast southwards, forming what is today&#x27;s Marina East.

===Settlements===
Historically, Kallang was home to some of Singapore&#x27;s earliest settlers. Numerous villages could be found at the Kallang Basin area before modern developments took place: Kampong Kallang Pasir, Kampong Kallang Pokok, Kampong Kallang Laut, Kampong Kallang Batin, Kampong Kallang Rokok, Kampong Bugis, Kampong Soo Poo (also the name of a now-expunged road, located off Kallang Road) and Kampong Koo Chye.

Today, some of their legacies are still seen – roads such as Padang Jeringau and Kampong Bugis that branch out from Kallang Road directly reference these expunged villages.

In the 1950s, housing in Singapore was insufficient for its growing population. A large portion of the population was living in slum-like places with poor sanitation. As the city area became congested, the colonial government decided to build new public housing estates to tackle the problem. One of the plans was to develop Kallang into Singapore&#x27;s equivalent of the Hyde Park, as reported by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in an article dated 11 March 1955. These residential developments are known collectively as the &quot;Old Kallang Airport Estate&quot;, located along Old Airport Road and Dakota Crescent. The low-rise residential blocks at Dakota Crescent are known for their unique architecture.

===Significant events===
On 4 December 1919, Singapore witnessed its first-ever aircraft landing at the Farrer Park Field, when Captain Ross Smith and three other crew members touched down in a Vickers Vimy en route to Darwin, Australia. This event kickstarted Singapore&#x27;s aviation journey.

On 17 February 1942, the troops of the British Indian Army officially surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army represented by Major Fujiwara Iwaichi at the Farrer Park Field as part of an event now called the &quot;Farrer Park address&quot;. Captain Mohan Singh later declared the formation of the First Indian National Army and openly recruited volunteers to fight against the British Raj for the independence of India.

On 29 June 1946, one of the Dakota aircraft belonging to the Royal Air Force (RAF) crashed at the Kallang Airport in a thunderstorm, killing all 20 that were on board. Officially named in 1957, Dakota Crescent and Dakota Close serve to commemorate this aviation disaster.

On 13 March 1954, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation aircraft operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) crashed and exploded as it attempted landing at the Kallang Airport, killing 33 passengers and crew.

On 15 August 1955, the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) campaigned for self-governance at the Farrer Park Field.

On 18 March 1956, some 20,000 people gathered at the Kallang Airport complex for a &quot;merdeka&quot; (Malay for &quot;freedom&quot;) rally organised by then-Chief Minister David Marshall. The event later turned into a riot, causing at least 50 cases of injuries. This riot discredited Marshall in the eyes of the British, thereby hindered Singapore&#x27;s independence progress and led to Marshall&#x27;s subsequent resignation.

Described as &quot;the worst and prolonged in Singapore&#x27;s post-war history&quot;, the infamous 1964 Singapore race riots broke out in Kallang on 21 July 1964, at the intersection of Kallang Road and Padang Jeringau, around the former Kampong Soo Poo.

On 23 February 1970, a time capsule was buried at the old National Stadium by then-Minister for Finance Goh Keng Swee. The capsule was never found despite more than three years of search. On 15 February 2016, a new time capsule was laid underground at the Singapore Sports Hub. It is expected to be unearthed in 2040.

The old National Stadium that once stood on the same plot of land as the current Singapore Sports Hub was the ceremony venue for the Southeast Asian Games in 1973, 1983 and 1993.

The old National Stadium hosted the National Day Parade (NDP) a total of 18 times (in 1976, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006).

From 1986 to 2000, former Singapore Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong held their annual National Day Rally at the Kallang Theatre.

On 20 April 2004, a section of Nicoll Highway collapsed in an accident now known as the Nicoll Highway collapse. The road itself and surrounding area sunk in, snapping gas, water and electricity cables, thereby cutting off power in the nearby Suntec City and Marina Bay areas. Tenants and residents of Golden Mile Complex were evacuated. The completion of the Circle Line was pushed back by a year, and the original site of Nicoll Highway MRT station which was 100 metres away from the current station had to be abandoned. The section of tracks between Promenade MRT station and Stadium MRT station had to be realigned. The collapse killed four people.

During the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, the archery, tennis and football games were held at Kallang Field, Kallang Tennis Centre and Jalan Besar Stadium respectively.

The opening and closing ceremonies of the 2015 Southeast Asian Games were held at the new National Stadium. Numerous matches also took place at various venues across Kallang.

On 9 August 2016, the new National Stadium hosted the 2016 NDP – the first NDP in the new National Stadium, and the first NDP held in Kallang after a decade of hiatus.

===Raffles&#x27; landing===
There is a dispute pertaining to the exact location where the founder of modern Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles, first landed on mainland Singapore in 1819. Even though the Raffles&#x27; Landing Site by the Singapore River is generally believed to be the original landing point, other sources challenge that claim. Based on the record in the Cho Clan Archives, Raffles could have landed at the Kallang Basin instead, in what is today&#x27;s Kallang Riverside Park.

==Landmarks==


Kallang is home to numerous &quot;historic sites&quot; of Singapore, as officially designated by the National Heritage Board (NHB). These include the Central Sikh Temple along Towner Road, the former Kallang Gasworks along Kallang Road, the Merdeka Bridge along Nicoll Highway, the Balestier Plain along Balestier Road, the old Kallang Airport along Stadium Link, the historic Farrer Park (now called &quot;Farrer Park Field&quot;) along Rutland Road, as well as the Jalan Besar Stadium along Tyrwhitt Road.

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has identified numerous areas in Singapore as &quot;conservation areas&quot;, a few of which can be found in Kallang. These include the Former Kallang Airport Conservation Area and the Jalan Besar Conservation Area, where structures of historical, architectural and cultural significance are carefully conserved. The Geylang Conservation Area extends partially into Kallang, consisting mainly of shophouses fronting the stretch of Geylang Road between Sims Way and Lorong 1 Geylang.

===Modern landmarks===
Arguably the most famous landmark in modern Kallang is the Singapore Sports Hub, comprising the new National Stadium, the Singapore Indoor Stadium, the Kallang Wave Mall, and several other sports facilities. Built at an estimated cost of S$1.3 billion, the Singapore Sports Hub frequently hosts national and international sporting, cultural and entertainment events.

The Merdeka Bridge crosses over the Kallang Basin at the mouths of the Kallang River and Rochor River. Initially conceived as the &quot;Kallang Bridge&quot;, the Merdeka Bridge was considered as a symbol of Singapore&#x27;s aspiration for independence in the 1950s. A pair of stone lions called the &quot;Merdeka Lions&quot; once stood at each end of the bridge from 1956 to 1966. These lion statues are now standing at the SAFTI Military Institute.

The Kallang Airport was Singapore&#x27;s first purpose-built civil airport, operating from 1937 to 1955. Hailed as the &quot;finest airport in the British Empire&quot;, it was also praised by renowned aviator Amelia Earhart as &quot;an aviation miracle of the East&quot;. Several structures of the Kallang Airport were gazetted for conservation on 5 December 2008. Today, the complex is fenced off from public access.

The Golden Mile Complex along Beach Road is a prominent landmark in the area. It was one of the Singapore government&#x27;s first urban renewal projects, combining commercial and residential spaces into one building. It was described by famous English architectural critic Reyner Banham as &quot;an exemplary type of megastructure&quot;. The congregation of the Thai community at Golden Mile Complex also gives it the nickname &quot;Little Thailand&quot;. The surrounding area is termed &quot;the Golden Mile&quot;, a strip of high-rise commercial land fronting the Kallang Basin.

Chwee Kang Beo Temple (水江庙), which means ‘Water River Temple’ has been at the present location since the late 1940s. It is a unique landmark along Kallang riverside, at Upper Boon Keng Road.

The Central Sikh Temple is Singapore&#x27;s first Sikh gurdwara, originally established in 1912. Its current site at Towner Road was officially opened in November 1986.

The Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple along Serangoon Road was gazetted as a national monument on 10 November 1978.

The main factory building of the former National Aerated Water Company along Serangoon Road has also been gazetted for conservation, and will be integrated into a future residential development.

===Old landmarks===


The Kallang Gasworks was the first of its kind to be built in Singapore to supply gas for street lighting. Constructed in 1862, the facilities were operated by the Singapore Gas Company (now called &quot;City Gas&quot;) and produced gas uninterruptedly for over 130 years, except for brief pauses during World War I and World War II. It was decommissioned on 23 March 1998, and all operations were taken over by the Senoko Gasworks in Sembawang. Today, a sculpture titled &quot;Spirit of Kallang&quot; by Singaporean artist Lim Leong Seng is standing in the Kallang Riverside Park to commemorate the Kallang Gasworks.

Built on the runway site of the former Kallang Airport prior to the development of the old National Stadium, the now-demolished Kallang Park was a large public park that consisted of children&#x27;s playgrounds, a fountain gifted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), carnival booths and the popular Wonderland Amusement Park. Originally proposed by then-Minister for National Development Ong Eng Guan under &quot;Project Lung&quot;, the Kallang Park was the first attempt at redeveloping the lands previously occupied by the Kallang Airport.

Kallang was also the location of three of Singapore&#x27;s most iconic amusement parks: New World Amusement Park, Gay World Amusement Park and Wonderland Amusement Park. The first was situated near present-day City Square Mall; the second was located on the open field bounded by Geylang Road, Sims Way, Kallang Airport Way and Kallang Airport Drive; and the third was part of the old Kallang Park.

Perhaps the most iconic of all historic landmarks in Kallang was the old National Stadium, once located on the same site currently occupied by the new National Stadium which is part of the larger Singapore Sports Hub. The old National Stadium played host to numerous cultural, sporting and national events, including the National Day Parade (NDP) for a total of 18 times. Celebrated as be the birthplace of the famous Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave, the old National Stadium was home to the Singapore FA (nicknamed &quot;the Lions&quot;). Today, the shopping mall at the Singapore Sports Hub is named &quot;Kallang Wave Mall&quot;.

==Politics==
===Current jurisdiction===
The political representation of Kallang in the Parliament of Singapore is split among three electoral constituencies as of the 2020 Singapore general election. The vast majority of Kallang forms part of Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency (GRC); part of Kampong Java subzone comes under Tanjong Pagar GRC; and the entirety of Tanjong Rhu subzone is part of Mountbatten Single Member Constituency (SMC). These constituencies are held by Singapore&#x27;s ruling People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP).

Jalan Besar Town Council is responsible for the maintenance of the areas that come under Jalan Besar GRC; Tanjong Pagar Town Council maintains areas belonging to Tanjong Pagar GRC; and Mountbatten SMC is administered by Marine Parade Town Council. The main office of Jalan Besar Town Council is located in Kallang, at 70 Geylang Bahru.

===Former jurisdiction===
From 2011 to 2015, large parts of Kallang were part of the short-lived Moulmein-Kallang Group Representation Constituency (GRC), which was co-led by then-Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim and then-Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew. The area bounded by Sungei Whampoa, Serangoon Road, Balestier Road and the Central Expressway (CTE) formed part of Whampoa Single Member Constituency (SMC). Tanjong Rhu was under Mountbatten SMC. Both Moulmein-Kallang GRC and Whampoa SMC came under the administration of the now-dissolved Moulmein-Kallang Town Council, which was headquartered at the same Geylang Bahru office currently used by Jalan Besar Town Council.

Between 1959 and 1991, Kallang mostly came under Kallang SMC. Its Members of Parliament (MP) included Suppiah Dhanabalan, who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for National Development during his service as MP for Kallang SMC. Other constituencies that historically covered various parts of Kallang included the now-defunct Geylang West SMC, Jalan Besar SMC and Kolam Ayer SMC.

==Economy==

===Commercial===
Unlike most Singaporean towns, Kallang does not have an integrated town centre. Instead, its commercial activities are largely concentrated at the Singapore Sports Hub, as well as within the subzones of Lavender and Crawford.

The Singapore Sports Hub vicinity is home to two shopping destinations, Leisure Park Kallang and Kallang Wave Mall, as well as a cultural venue, the Kallang Theatre. Other than retail outlets, Leisure Park Kallang also has a cinema, an ice skating rink and a bowling alley. Various other shopping malls such as the City Square Mall along Kitchener Road, Mustafa Centre along Syed Alwi Road and Aperia Mall along Kallang Avenue are also situated within the boundaries of Kallang.

In recent years, areas along Beach Road and Jalan Sultan have seen new commercial developments, such as The Concourse and City Gate, due to their close proximities to the adjacent Central Area.

The high rent in the Central Area also makes Kallang an attractive location for offices, particularly office spaces along Kallang Avenue, Lavender Street and Beach Road. Examples of renowned companies that have offices in Kallang include German automotive firm Continental AG, American technology company Micron Technology, Japanese consumer goods manufacturer Lion Corporation, American fast food group Yum! Brands, French energy management and automation solutions corporation Schneider Electric, and the Singapore-based environmental solutions enterprise Hyflux.

===Industries===
Kallang is currently home to numerous light industrial estates. Many heavy industry factories have been relocated away from this area to promote residential and commercial use. Today, most of Kallang&#x27;s industrial estates are clustered at Kallang Avenue, Kallang Bahru, Kallang Place, Kallang Junction, Kallang Sector and Kallang Way. There are plans to redevelop Kallang&#x27;s industrial zones into mixed-use developments, including a hub for high-value and knowledge-based businesses called the &quot;Kallang iPark&quot;.

Prior to modern developments, Kallang was home to a booming shipbuilding industry, particularly due to its coastal location and the presence of numerous waterways in the area. Shipbuilding companies were found around present-day Upper Boon Keng Road and Jalan Benaan Kapal (literally &quot;Ship Construction Road&quot; in Malay). In particular, the latter was the location of the first purpose-built marine industrial estate in Singapore, before the area was transformed into a sporting and lifestyle precinct. Across the Geylang River, numerous shipbuilding companies, including John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company and Singapore Slipway, once straddled the coast of Tanjong Rhu.

==Infrastructure==

===Education===

The following educational institutions are located within Kallang:
*Dunman High School
*Hong Wen School
*Bendemeer Primary School
*Farrer Park Primary School
*NorthLight School
*Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre

3 Geylang Bahru Lane was frequently used by the Ministry of Education (MOE) as a temporary school compound, and hosted such schools as Victoria School, Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School, SJI Junior and CHIJ Katong Convent. This site is now used by the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) as its office.

The current site of NorthLight School used to be the former Balestier campus of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).

===Healthcare===
The following hospitals are located within Kallang:

*KK Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital
*Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced an upcoming polyclinic in Kallang, expected to be ready by 2020. The polyclinic will be housed in a 10-storey facility and integrated with a chronic sick unit, the first of such integrated healthcare building in Singapore.

===Community spaces===

Managed by the People&#x27;s Association (PA), each &quot;community club&quot; or &quot;community centre&quot; (CC) serves around 15,000 households.

The following CCs are located at Kallang:

*Geylang West Community Club
*Jalan Besar Community Club
*Kallang Community Club
*Kampong Glam Community Club
*Katong Community Centre
*Kolam Ayer Community Club
*PAssion WaVe @ Marina Bay
*Pek Kio Community Centre

The PA headquarters is also situated in Kallang, along King George&#x27;s Avenue.

===Parklands===


The Kallang Riverside Park is a riverine park located at the mouths of the Kallang River and Rochor River. The sections on either side of the Kallang River are managed by the National Parks Board (NParks), while the section along the western bank of the Rochor River was absorbed into Gardens by the Bay as part of Bay Central Garden.

The Marina Promenade on the western banks of the Kallang Basin and Marina Channel links Kallang Riverside Park in the north with Marina Centre in the south. It forms part of the Bay Central Garden of Gardens by the Bay.

Kallang Park Connector is part of the Park Connector Network (PCN) managed by NParks, running from Bishan Road in the north to Sims Avenue in the south, largely following the course of the Kallang River. Constructed in 1995, it is the first park connector of its kind to be built and forms part of the Central Urban Loop. As their names imply, these park connectors aim to form a continuous loop which will eventually connect all the major parks within Singapore. Kallang Park Connector runs parallel to the Kallang River, except for the section around Woodsville Interchange. It serves as a link between Bishan–Ang Mo Kio Park and Kallang Riverside Park. Spanning 7.87 kilometres, Kallang Park Connector is the third longest park connector in Singapore, after Coastal Park Connector and Jurong Park Connector which are 15 kilometres-long and 9.4 kilometres-long respectively. Points of interest along Kallang Park Connector include Kallang River @ Bishan–Ang Mo Kio Park, as well as the Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront. Plans to further rejuvenate the Kallang riverside, including the construction of bridges and underpasses to facilitate seamless connection across major traffic junctions, have been proposed.

Other park connectors that run through Kallang include Geylang Park Connector, Pelton Canal Park Connector, Whampoa Park Connector and the Tanjong Rhu Promenade.

East Coast Park is a coastal park that straddles the southeastern coast of Singapore, extending from Marine Parade to Tampines. Aside from serving the areas that it is located in, East Coast Park also serves various nearby communities like Kallang. East Coast Park can be accessed via Fort Road from Kallang.

Located within the subzone of Kampong Java, at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Cavenagh Road, was the Kampong Java Park. Like the Kallang Riverside Park, this park was maintained by NParks and featured a large pond as its centrepiece. In August 2018, the Kampong Java Park was permanently closed to facilitate the construction of the North–South Corridor (NSC).

===Security===
The responsibility of maintaining security in Kallang is split among three police divisions of the Singapore Police Force (SPF): Central Police Division, Bedok Police Division and Tanglin Police Division. In particular, the Tanglin Police Division has its headquarters located in Kallang, along Kampong Java Road.

The following police establishments are located within Kallang:

*Cairnhill Neighbourhood Police Post
*Kallang Neighbourhood Police Post
*Kampong Glam Neighbourhood Police Post
*Kampong Java Neighbourhood Police Centre
*Kolam Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post

From 1970 to 2007, the Kallang Regional Base along Stadium Lane on the northeastern bank of the Kallang Basin served as the headquarters of the Police Coast Guard and its predecessor, the Marine Division. Its operations were subsequently relocated to Brani Regional Base on Pulau Brani as a result of the planned damming of the Kallang Basin and Marina Bay to create the Marina Reservoir.

The headquarters of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is located on Kallang Road, next to Lavender MRT station.

===Fire department===
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) operates two fire posts in Kallang:

*Boon Keng Fire Post
*Mountbatten Fire Post

The Mountbatten Fire Post along Kampong Arang Road was opened in June 2001, becoming the first fire post in Singapore.

The upcoming Kallang Fire Station along Guillemard Close is slated for completion in 2019. It will enhance emergency response to key areas in Kallang, including the Singapore Sports Hub, as well as the waterfront regions around Marina Bay and along the Kallang River.

The former Serangoon Fire Station was built in 1952 and ceased operations in 2001. It was based at 1370 Serangoon Road, in Bendemeer subzone.

During the colonial era, Singapore&#x27;s fire fighting duty came under the Singapore Fire Brigade. By 1909, three fire stations were set up across Singapore, including the now-demolished Kallang Fire Station (&quot;not to be confused with the similarly-named new Kallang Fire Station on Guillemard Close&quot;).

===Postal service===
Three of the post offices managed by the Singapore Post (SingPost) are based in Kallang:

*City Square Post Office
*Crawford Post Office
*Towner Post Office

SingPost&#x27;s Kallang Delivery Base is located along Jalan Lembah Kallang.

==Housing==
As a result of Kallang&#x27;s prime location just outside the Central Area, the urban planning strategy and land use policy therefore differ from towns that are established primarily for residential use (e.g. Pasir Ris and Choa Chu Kang). Housing precincts appear to be &quot;discontinuous&quot; and &quot;scattered&quot; in Kallang, as compared to the aforementioned towns with &quot;clustered&quot; and &quot;concentrated&quot; residential neighbourhoods. In Kallang, lands set aside for residential developments may be punctuated with commercial, industrial or lifestyle areas, resulting in a disjointed town layout.

Kallang is the main constituent unit of the Kallang/Whampoa New Town as defined by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). It is the only HDB town to extend across two separate planning areas (i.e. Kallang and Novena). Previously, Kallang was classified as an &quot;estate&quot; but HDB later reorganised the area and promoted it to &quot;new town&quot; status.

The first few residential precincts in Kallang, constructed by the HDB, were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Some housing blocks are planned to be reconstructed under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) to redevelop Kallang where the demographics are dominated by the middle-aged.

New residential blocks which are around 30-storeys high are now prominent in the skyline of the area, with more being planned to be built under the new HDB construction policy. A notable major redevelopment is underway in the Old Kallang Airport Estate, where many of the low-rise blocks are currently unoccupied. New estates along Bendemeer Road and Upper Boon Keng Road are also popular options.

Kallang/Whampoa is the fourth most expensive HDB new town in terms of rental prices. The rental price of a median 4-room HDB unit in Kallang/Whampoa is S$2500, compared to the national average of S$2120.

Aside from public housing (flats) built by HDB, condominiums that provide high-end living options can be found primarily in Tanjong Rhu, an affluent neighbourhood in southern Kallang. The precinct is in extreme close proximity to the Central Area located across the Kallang Basin and Marina Channel, as well as Gardens by the Bay (Bay East Garden). Condominium clusters can also be found along Saint Michael&#x27;s Road and Moonstone Lane, within the subzone of Bendemeer.

Car-free residential area will be piloted in the subzone of Kampong Bugis, at the mouth of Kallang River. These new blocks will be part of a fenceless pedestrian-friendly waterfront community that was announced by the government in 2013. Around 4000 new housing units will be ready by 2030. Soil treatment work at the former Kallang Gasworks site began in November 2018 and is expected to conclude in July 2022.

The following HDB precincts are located in Kallang:

*Beach Road Gardens
*Bendemeer Court
*Bendemeer Light
*Bendemeer Ville
*Boon Keng Ville
*City View @ Boon Keng
*Crawford Court
*Di Tanjong Rhu
*Dorset View
*Farrer Park Gardens
*Farrer Park View
*Geylang Bahru Riverpoint
*Geylang Bahru Ville
*Golden Beach Vista
*Kallang Heights
*Kallang Residences (&quot;under construction&quot;)
*Kallang Trivista
*Kent Ville
*Lavender Gardens
*McNair Spring
*McNair Towers
*Saint George&#x27;s East Gardens
*Saint George&#x27;s Towers
*Saint George&#x27;s West Gardens
*South River View
*The River Vista @ Kallang
*Towner Heights
*Upper Boon Keng Riverview

==Transportation==
The location of Kallang on the fringe of the Central Area is evidenced by its mature network of roads and developed public transport system. In addition, the headquarters of the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is situated along Hampshire Road, in the Kampong Java subzone.

===Road network===
Unlike towns which have a high concentration of housing developments, the roads in Kallang were not named using the numeric system. The name &quot;Kallang&quot; can be found in roads like Kallang Road, Kallang Bahru, Kallang Tengah, Kallang Sector, Kallang Pudding Road, Kallang Walk, Jalan Lembah Kallang, etc. Flyovers that bear the name &quot;Kallang&quot; are Kallang Bahru Flyover and Kallang Way Flyover. Expunged roads that had the name &quot;Kallang&quot; included Kallang Close and Kallang Square.

Several roads opposite Saint Andrew&#x27;s Village took their names from gemstones: Moonstone Lane, Opal Crescent, Topaz Road, etc.; some roads in Bendemeer subzone were named after saints: Saint Michael&#x27;s Road, Saint George&#x27;s Road, Saint Barnabas Lane, etc.; roads in the Kampong Java precinct were named after British locations: Dorset Road, Kent Road, Cambridge Road, etc.; some roads took their names from the villages that once stood in the area: Kampong Bugis, Padang Jeringau; some road names reference the former Kallang Airport and its aviation history: Old Airport Road, Dakota Crescent, Kallang Airport Way, Old Terminal Lane, etc.; roads within the Singapore Sports Hub reference the National Stadium: Stadium Boulevard, Stadium Walk, Stadium Place, etc.; roads within the Old Kallang Airport Estate are numbered in the Malay language: Jalan Satu, Jalan Empat, Jalan Enam, etc.; roads around the Lavender area were named after generals and admirals from Britain and France, as well as famous battle sites: Maude Road, Beatty Road, Jellicoe Road, Flanders Square, Somme Road, etc.

Woodsville Interchange along the triple-point boundary of Kallang, Geylang and Toa Payoh is a major traffic interchange consisting of at-grade junctions, the Woodsville Flyover and the new Woodsville Tunnel. Seven roads converge at Woodsville Interchange: Bendemeer Road, Serangoon Road, Upper Serangoon Road, MacPherson Road, Jalan Kolam Ayer, Jalan Toa Payoh and the Pan Island Expressway (PIE). The latest upgrading works were completed in January 2012.

From 2014 to 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) carried out a series of road improvement works in Kallang, including the widening of several major roads and traffic junctions in the area, as well as the construction of the Nicoll Underpass that links Sims Way, Nicoll Highway and Stadium Drive. These works aimed to support the development of the Kallang riverside, Singapore Sports Hub and Kallang Industrial Estate.

The Singapore Underground Road System (SURS) was a proposed underground ring road that would encircle the Singapore city centre. Part of the suggested route included a section within Kallang, near Nicoll Highway, Lavender Street and Balestier Road. First conceptualised in the 1980s, the plan for the SURS was abandoned in August 2017.

====Major roads====
The following roads connect Kallang with other parts of Singapore:

*Balestier Road connects Kallang with Novena;
*Serangoon Road links the ethnic neighbourhood of Little India to Kallang;
*Upper Serangoon Road is the northern extension of Serangoon Road and links Kallang with Potong Pasir, Bidadari, Serangoon and various other towns in northeastern Singapore;
*Bukit Timah Road connects Kallang with Tanglin, Bukit Timah and the western parts of Singapore;
*Jalan Besar connects Kallang to Rochor;
*Victoria Street links Kallang with the Central Area;
*North Bridge Road links Kallang to the Central Area;
*Beach Road links Kallang with the Central Area;
*Nicoll Highway is a semi-expressway that connects Kallang with the Central Area;
*Republic Boulevard connects Kallang with Marina Centre;
*Sims Avenue links Kallang to Geylang;
*Geylang Road links Geylang to Kallang;
*Guillemard Road links Kallang and Geylang;
*Dunman Road connects Kallang and Katong;
*Mountbatten Road links Kallang with Marine Parade and the Singapore east coast;
*Meyer Road links Kallang and Marine Parade;
*Fort Road links Kallang and the East Coast Park;
*East Coast Park Service Road links Kallang and the East Coast Park;
*Marina East Drive links Kallang and Marina East;
*MacPherson Road links Kallang with MacPherson.

Other major roads that run within the boundaries of Kallang include Kallang Road, Kallang Bahru, Geylang Bahru, Boon Keng Road, Upper Boon Keng Road, Lavender Street, Crawford Street, Republic Avenue, Kitchener Road, Bendemeer Road and Tanjong Rhu Road.

====Expressways====
The following expressways pass through Kallang:

*Central Expressway (CTE) links Kallang to the Central Area, Bukit Merah, Ang Mo Kio and Seletar;
*East Coast Parkway (ECP) links Kallang to Marine Parade, Bedok and Changi Airport;
*Kallang–Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) links Kallang to Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol;
*Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) links Kallang to Marina South and the future downtown extension at Marina Bay;
*Pan Island Expressway (PIE) links Kallang to Changi Airport, Tampines, Bedok, Geylang, Toa Payoh, Clementi, Jurong East, Jurong West and Tuas.

KPE consists of a 9 kilometres-long tunnel, which is the longest subterranean road tunnel in Southeast Asia. During its construction, the KPE tunnel was the world&#x27;s sixth longest underground road project. Originally envisioned as two separate expressways, the 2.8 kilometres-long Kallang Expressway (KLE) and the 9.2 kilometres-long Paya Lebar Expressway (PLE), they were officially combined into one in 1991. Plans to build the KLE surfaced as early as 1981, and would have become the shortest expressway in Singapore if it was not merged into the KPE.

The future North–South Corridor (NSC) will link Kallang and the city centre with northern Singapore. The section of NSC within Kallang will be fully underground.

===Public transit===

====Rail====

Rail transport in Kallang exists as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT). Kallang has the largest number of MRT stations outside of the Downtown Core, at 12. At present, five MRT lines have stations in Kallang: East West Line, North East Line, Circle Line, Downtown Line and Thomson–East Coast Line.

The following stations are currently in service:

* Kallang
* Lavender
* Little India
* Farrer Park
* Boon Keng
* Nicoll Highway
* Stadium
* Mountbatten
* Bendemeer
* Geylang Bahru
* Tanjong Rhu
* Katong Park

A 16 kilometres-long &quot;Kallang Line&quot; was mentioned in the 1996 White Paper published by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). This MRT line was supposed to run along the banks of the Kallang River, connecting Ang Mo Kio MRT station in the north with Lavender MRT station in the south. The plan to build the Kallang Line was later shelved.

On 20 April 2004, a section of the Circle Line tunnel collapsed during construction. This accident became known as the &quot;Nicoll Highway collapse&quot; and happened west of the Merdeka Bridge, near present-day Nicoll Highway MRT station.

====Bus====
Kallang is served by an established bus network that connects the area with other parts of Singapore. Unlike other towns, Kallang does not have its own feeder bus services which ply between the neighbourhoods of Kallang, likely due to the relatively fewer housing precincts in Kallang as compared to other new towns that are established primarily for residential purpose.

Lorong 1 Geylang Bus Terminal is the only bus terminal located in Kallang. It sits opposite Kallang MRT station, along its namesake Lorong 1 Geylang. The Kallang area has no bus interchange or Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).

The former Crawford Street Bus Terminal was situated near the traffic junction of Crawford Street and North Bridge Road. Bus services that used to operate from this bus terminal were moved to Lorong 1 Geylang Bus Terminal when it ceased operations in 1998.

===Air travel===


Kallang played a significant role in Singapore&#x27;s aviation history, being the location of the country&#x27;s first aircraft landing and home to its first purpose-built civil airport, the Kallang Airport.

Opened on 12 June 1937 by Sir Shenton Thomas, the then-Governor of the Straits Settlements, Kallang Airport had the advantages of combined facilities for both land and marine aircraft. It was hailed as the &quot;finest airport in the British Empire&quot; at that time.

During its 18 years in service, the Kallang Airport played host to numerous high-profile celebrities such as Governor of Singapore Sir John Fearns Nicoll, former Premier of China Zhou Enlai, and renowned Chinese businessman and philanthropist Tan Kah Kee, among others.

Due to an increase in passenger traffic, the Singapore International Airport (modern-day Paya Lebar Air Base) was later built in Paya Lebar to replace the Kallang Airport which eventually ceased operations in 1955. The airport&#x27;s terminal building was conserved alongside the hangar, gate posts, lamp posts and several other buildings. The terminal building was subsequently converted into the People&#x27;s Association (PA) headquarters on 1 July 1960. The organisation occupied the building until 6 April 2009 when it moved to its current location at King George&#x27;s Avenue, also in Kallang. Other groups that used to be based at the Kallang Airport site include the Singapore Youth Sports Council, the Public Works Department (the predecessor of CPG Corporation) and Central Manpower Base (CMPB). The conserved Kallang Airport complex is currently unoccupied and restricted from public access.

Today, legacies of the old Kallang Airport remain. Roads such as Old Airport Road (named as such because it was the eastern boundary of the Kallang Airport), Kallang Airport Drive, Kallang Airport Way and Old Terminal Lane bear reference to the Kallang Airport. A signboard with the words &quot;Kallang Airport&quot; is standing at the junction of Old Airport Road and Cassia Link, in front of 95 Old Airport Road. Dakota Crescent, Dakota Close and Dakota MRT station are named after the Douglas DC-3 &quot;Dakota&quot; aircraft that used to frequently land at the Kallang Airport, and serve to commemorate an aviation disaster in 1946. The residential precincts on either side of Old Airport Road are collectively called the &quot;Old Kallang Airport Estate&quot;.

The conserved Kallang Airport building was one of the hosting venues of the 2011 Singapore Biennale. The decision to hold this art festival at the old Kallang Airport was controversial, with negative opinions surrounding the building&#x27;s poor ventilation and inaccessibility.

There are plans to redevelop the Kallang Airport area into a commercial hub, along with the nearby Kallang riverside. This proposed plan is known as &quot;Old Airport Square&quot;, as envisioned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Master Plan 2008.

Predating the Kallang Airport, Singapore&#x27;s first aircraft landing took place at the Farrer Park Field on 4 December 1919, when Captain Ross Smith touched down in a Vickers Vimy along with three other crew members.

==Sports==


Kallang occupies an important position in Singapore&#x27;s sporting culture and history, particularly due to the several iconic sports locations sited within its boundaries, as well as the numerous high-profile sporting events held there. Famous sports facilities include the old National Stadium, the Jalan Besar Stadium, the Farrer Park Field, and the Singapore Sports Hub.

Kallang is notable for being the location of the former National Stadium (nicknamed the &quot;Grand Old Dame of Kallang&quot;) and the new Singapore Sports Hub which was built on the same site to replace the former. The latter is the flagship development in Kallang and includes the new National Stadium, the Singapore Indoor Stadium, the OCBC Aquatic Centre, the OCBC Arena, the Kallang Wave Mall, the Singapore Sports Museum, the Sports Hub Library, as well as several other sports facilities. The Singapore Sports Hub is the only &quot;Tier 1&quot; facility under the Sports Facilities Master Plan. The Singapore national football team is based at the new National Stadium.

Aside from being a traditional location for hosting the National Day Parade (NDP), the old National Stadium also played host to numerous notable cultural and sports events, including those of the Malaysia Cup, where loud cheers and stamping of feet gave birth to the famous &quot;Kallang Roar&quot;. The famous &quot;Kallang Wave&quot; is a type of Mexican wave that often took place in the old National Stadium during those games. Both the Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave are considered to be symbols of national unity. The 1973, 1983 and 1993 Southeast Asian Games used the old National Stadium as its ceremony venue.

The future Kallang Football Hub will replace the current Kallang Field, and is expected to be ready by the third quarter of 2019. It will incorporate three full-sized football pitches, four sheltered futsal pitches, a running track and a gymnasium. Other than serving as an alternative training ground for the Singapore national football team, the Kallang Football Hub will also be open to the public.

The Kallang Field located along Stadium Boulevard hosted the archery events during the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. The adjacent Kallang Tennis Centre, which is a frequent training ground for the Singapore national tennis team, hosted the tennis games.

The Kallang Ground is another sporting venue located in Kallang, and has played host to several One Day International cricket matches. In more recent times, it is mainly used to host domestic competitions and minor international matches such as those between Singapore and Malaysia. Kallang Ground was home to the Singapore national cricket team for 21 years.

Other sports facilities located along Stadium Boulevard and constitute the Kallang Sports Centre include the Kallang Practice Track, Kallang Lawn Bowl, Kallang Squash Centre and Kallang Netball Court.

Jalan Besar Stadium is another iconic sports stadium located in Kallang, within the close proximity of Jalan Besar, hence its name. Jalan Besar Stadium is considered to be the &quot;birthplace of Singapore football&quot;, and is where the Football Association of Singapore is based. During the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, the stadium hosted the football games.

Swimming pools managed by Sport Singapore are located at Kallang Basin Swimming Complex and Jalan Besar Swimming Complex, along Geylang Bahru Lane and Tyrwhitt Road respectively. The Singapore Swimming Club along Tanjong Rhu Road was established in 1894 by a group of Europeans.

Also maintained by Sport Singapore and located within Kallang, the Farrer Park Field (formerly known simply as &quot;Farrer Park&quot;) along Rutland Road is an amalgamation of one soccer field and one rugby field. Previously, it was home to the Singapore Sporting Club and Serangoon Road Race Course, the latter of which was Singapore&#x27;s first race course. The nearby Race Course Road and Race Course Lane bear witness to the site&#x27;s horse racing past. The Farrer Park Field is also a significant location in Singapore&#x27;s football, aviation and political histories. It will be vacated by mid-2020 for future residential development.

The Kallang Basin is a favourite location for water sports like dragon boating, water skiing and canoeing. Located at Stadium Lane, the Kallang Water Sports Centre provides boat rental and various related services. In addition, the nearby Singapore Sports Hub also has a dedicated Water Sports Centre that provides similar services.

Operated by the People&#x27;s Association (PA) and located along Rhu Cross, PAssion WaVe @ Marina Bay offers water-themed activities. It is the first &quot;Specialist CC&quot; and the eighth Water-Venture outlet in Singapore, built to replace the Water-Venture (Kallang) which was located at 4876 Beach Road. The facility of the former Water-Venture (Kallang) currently houses the Kallang branch of the Waterways Watch Society (WWS).

The northeastern section (Turn 1, Turn 2, Turn 3) of the Marina Bay Street Circuit is located in Kallang. The Marina Bay Street Circuit is the venue of the annual Formula One (F1) Singapore Grand Prix. Several F1-related developments, such as a grandstand and first aid facilities, are also situated in Kallang.

The former headquarters of the Singapore Sports Council (the preceding entity of Sport Singapore) was located at 15 Stadium Road. Currently, the Sport Singapore headquarters is situated at 3 Stadium Drive, within the Singapore Sports Hub.

Kallang was the hosting site for numerous matches of the 2015 Southeast Asian Games. The new National Stadium was the venue for its opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the host for the athletics and football matches. Netball, basketball, fencing, indoor volleyball, as well as the billiards and snooker games were conducted at the OCBC Arena. The Singapore Indoor Stadium held the badminton and table tennis matches. The OCBC Aquatic Centre was the location of the diving, swimming, synchronised swimming and water polo games. The Kallang Squash Centre, Kallang Tennis Centre, Kallang Ground, Kallang Field and Kallang Practice Track hosted the squash, tennis, archery, softball and marathon games respectively. Jalan Besar Stadium also conducted the football games, in addition to the new National Stadium.

==Future developments==
The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has proposed to transform Kallang into a lifestyle and commercial hub, with the Kallang River and Singapore Sports Hub as the centrepieces of the town.

===Residential===
Over the next two decades, around 100,000 new housing units will be built. Kampong Bugis will be developed into a car-lite waterfront community. New housing estates are also planned at Dakota Crescent, Lorong 3 Geylang and the area now occupied by the Farrer Park Field.

===Lifestyle===
A new promenade along the Kallang River has been announced. It aims to seamlessly connect areas at the upstream of the river such as Bishan to the Downtown Core. More specifically, the construction of underpasses and bridges have been proposed as viable options to improve the connectivity at major traffic junctions.

===Connectivity===
Two new Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations, namely Tanjong Rhu MRT station and Katong Park MRT station, on the Thomson–East Coast Line are under construction. Once ready by 2023, these two stations will serve southern Kallang, particularly the affluent communities along Tanjong Rhu Road.

The upcoming North–South Corridor (NSC) will enhance connectivity between Kallang, Toa Payoh, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun and Woodlands. It is slated for completion in 2026.

===Amenities===
The upcoming Kallang Fire Station situated at the junction of Guillemard Road and Guillemard Close will be the 22nd fire station operated by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), with a target completion date in 2019. Other than hosting the fire department, Kallang Fire Station will also house a Home Team Joint Facility, which will act as a key command for the Home Team during major event standbys and joint operations in Kallang.

A new 10-storey polyclinic will be built in Kallang by 2020, as announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH). It will be located near the junction of Serangoon Road and Balestier Road, adjacent to Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital.

===Master Plan 2014===
According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Master Plan 2014, the following lands in Kallang will see future redevelopment:

*Geylang Bahru Industrial Estate along Geylang Bahru Terrace is marked as a residential site, as is the land currently occupied by the Kallang Distripark;
*Land parcels on the eastern bank of the Kallang River, along Old Terminal Lane and Stadium Road, are marked as hotel sites;
*Lands around the conserved Kallang Airport complex are marked as &quot;white&quot; sites which allow for more flexible planning (white sites are rare outside of the Central Area);
*Lands along Nicoll Highway, Republic Avenue and Republic Boulevard are reserve sites, as are the lands between the Kallang River and Kallang Place, as well as those along Jalan Benaan Kapal and Stadium Crescent.

==Popular culture==
Kallang is heavily featured in the 2008 sports film &quot;Kallang Roar the Movie&quot;, of which the events leading up to Singapore winning the 1977 Malaysia Cup take centrestage. Filming took place at the old National Stadium where some of the football matches happened.

The 2016 Mediacorp drama &quot;Hero&quot; is set primarily in the residential precinct of Dakota Crescent, within the Old Kallang Airport Estate.

<doc id="987036" wikidata="Q3243642" url="?curid=987036" title="Hurricane Flora">
<text>Hurricane Flora is among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history, with a death total of at least 7,193. The seventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Flora developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone on September 26 while located southwest of the Cape Verde islands. After remaining a weak depression for several days, it rapidly organized on September 29 to attain tropical storm status. Flora continued to strengthen, reaching Category 3 hurricane status after moving through the Windward Islands and passing over Tobago, and it reached maximum sustained winds of in the Caribbean.

The storm struck southwestern Haiti near peak intensity, turned to the west, and drifted over Cuba for four days before turning to the northeast. Flora passed over the Bahamas and accelerated northeastward, becoming an extratropical cyclone on October 12. Due to its slow movement across Cuba, Flora is the wettest known tropical cyclone for Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The significant casualties caused by Flora were the most for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Basin since the 1900 Galveston Hurricane.

==Meteorological history==

A disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone turned into a tropical depression on September 26 while located about southwest of the island of Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands. Upon forming, the depression had a poorly organized circulation with banding features to its north and east. The depression moved west-northwestward, and the system failed to organize significantly by a day after developing. On September 27, the banding features dissipated, though the area of convection around the center increased. Satellite imagery was unavailable until September 30, during which there were not sufficient ship reports to indicate the presence of a low-level circulation. The depression continued west-northwestward, and it is estimated it intensified into Tropical Storm Flora on September 29 while located about east-southeast of Trinidad, or about north of Cayenne, French Guiana. Operationally, advisories were not initiated until a day later.

Flora quickly intensified after it became a tropical storm, and early on September 30 it attained hurricane status. Later that day, Reconnaissance Aircraft confirmed the existence of the hurricane, with the flight reporting a well-defined, circular wide eye. One observer noted Flora to be the best organized tropical cyclone over the previous two years. Flora passed directly over the island of Tobago late on the 30th with winds of . The hurricane continued west-northwestward as it entered the Caribbean, and early on October 2 its winds reached . Thirty hours later, Flora intensified slightly further and attained peak winds of while located about south of the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
After turning to the northwest, Hurricane Flora maintained its peak strength, and made landfall in Sud, Haiti, late on October 3 as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale with gusts from . The calm of the eye lasted for up to 70 minutes in one location. After quickly weakening to a hurricane, Flora turned more to the west in the Windward Passage, and restrengthened slightly to strike southeastern Cuba about east of Guantanamo Bay with winds of . A high pressure system to its north turned the motion of the hurricane to a westward drift, causing it to weaken quickly over land. Flora neared the north coast of Cuba on October 4 before turning to the south. It executed a cyclonic loop and entered the coastal waters off Granma Province. An anticyclone to the west of Flora turned the hurricane to the north, bringing it ashore near Santa Cruz del Sur on October 7 with winds of around . Flora initially turned southeastward over central Cuba, and late on October 8 a short-wave trough turned the hurricane northeastward, bringing it into the coastal waters of the Holguín Province. Flora remained a hurricane while drifting over land due to abundant moisture and a favorable upper-level environment.

After passing over the southeastern Bahamas early on October 9, Flora began to restrengthen, and on October 10 it again reached hurricane status while located south of Bermuda. The hurricane gradually weakened as it continued northeastward, and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on October 11. Flora gradually lost its convection over the north Atlantic Ocean, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 12 while located east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant dissipated the next day.

==Preparations==
The Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico, issued a hurricane warning for Trinidad, Tobago, and the Grenadines south of Saint Vincent in the cyclone&#x27;s first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized the danger of the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands to remain at harbor and for shipping in the path of the hurricane to advise extreme caution. People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.

On October 2, two days before it made landfall on southwestern Hispaniola, the San Juan Weather Bureau issued a gale warning from Barahona in the Dominican Republic to Sud-Est, Haiti. Advisories recommended small craft in the southern portions of the countries to remain at port. Later that day, the gale warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning in southwestern Haiti. On the day of when Flora made landfall, advisories recommended all citizens on beaches and in low-lying areas west of Santo Domingo to evacuate. Carmelo Di Franco, the provisional Director of Civic Defense for the Dominican Republic, organized safety procedures and the dissemination of tropical cyclone bulletins from the San Juan Weather Bureau. Di Franco also organized for the transmission of hurricane emergency information to citizens, believed to reduce the loss of life. On the afternoon before the hurricane struck, the head of the Haitian Red Cross prohibited radio broadcasts of tropical cyclone advisories for fear of panic among citizens. As a result, many thought the hurricane would miss the country.

Officials at the Cuban National Observatory issued radio bulletins on the hurricane, which included the position of Flora, its intensity, direction of motion, and necessary warnings. By the time the hurricane left the island, more than 40,000 had been evacuated to safer areas.

The Weather Bureau predicted Flora to turn to the northwest after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though the eye of the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane&#x27;s large size.

==Impact==

Throughout its path, Hurricane Flora resulted in more than 7,000 deaths and about $773.4 million in damage (1963 USD$,  USD). It is estimated that, if a hurricane like Flora had struck in 1998, it would have caused over 12,000 casualties.

===East Caribbean===
Hurricane Flora passed Barbados a few days after Hurricane Edith moved through the area. The two hurricanes resulted in about $65,000 in damage (1963 USD), primarily to fishing interests.

About four hours before the eye of Hurricane Flora moved over Tobago, the large hurricane began producing heavy rainfall throughout the island. Two hours later, strong winds began affecting the island, and while moving across the island Flora produced winds of up to . While moving past Tobago, the hurricane produced rough surf and tides above normal. The hurricane sunk six ships between 4 and 9 tons in Scarborough harbour. One crew member drowned while attempting to save his vessel. Heavy rainfall caused a large mudslide from Mount Dillon onto a road leading to Castara. This was considered the most well-known mudslide on the island. The strong winds caused severe damage to coconut, banana, and cocoa plantations, with 50% of the coconut trees being destroyed and another 11% being severely damaged. 75% of forest trees fell, and most of the remaining were greatly damaged. The passage of Hurricane Flora destroyed 2,750 of Tobago&#x27;s 7,500 houses, and damaged 3,500 others. The hurricane killed 18 on the island and resulted in $30 million in crop and property damage (1963 USD).

Winds on Trinidad reached with much higher gusts of over . Heavy rainfall and strong winds in the northern mountainous region lowered the visibility to zero. Due to the mountain range on its northern coast, damage on the island was minimal, totaling to $100,000 (1963 USD). Two people on the island died due to drowning. When Flora passed the island and the winds turned to the southwest, many small boats in the westward facing harbor were sunk. Near Chaguaramas, nine boats were destroyed and eight were damaged. Additionally, several large vessels sustained damage and resulted in them being intentionally sunk. Damage in Grenada was minor, around $25,000 (1963 USD), though six people died due to drowning. Rough seas and higher than normal tides were reported along the south coast of Puerto Rico, though no damage or deaths were reported there.

===Dominican Republic and Haiti===

Flora produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds in the Dominican Republic. The highest rainfall amount reported was at Polo Barahona. Flooding from the hurricane, considered to be the most extensive on record, greatly damaged bridges and roads, with many roads left unpassable for several months after the hurricane struck. Over in the western portion of the country were flooded. The hurricane caused about $60 million in damage (1963 USD) and over 400 deaths.
While moving across southwestern Haiti, Hurricane Flora produced winds of up to near Derez, while the capital city of Port-au-Prince reported peak winds of . Intense rainbands dropped torrential precipitation estimated at over in Miragoâne, with one location recording over in three days. One location in the southwestern peninsula recorded of precipitation in 12 hours. The storm surge on the southern coast is unknown, but estimated to exceed . Flash floods from the hurricane washed out large sections of several towns, while mudslides buried some entire towns, resulting in many deaths. Heavy rainfall led to river flooding along the Grise River, which crested at above normal. The flood waters created new channels and washed away entire banana plantations.

Strong winds in southwestern Haiti from the hurricane damaged or destroyed hundreds of trees. The path of Flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula. The strong winds left entire villages roofless, with many buildings entirely destroyed. The combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. Many of those who died in southwestern Haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds. In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.

About 3,500 people were confirmed dead, with several thousands missing at one report five months after the hurricane. It is estimated the passage of Hurricane Flora killed around 5,000 people and caused between $125 million and $180 million in damage in Haiti (1963 USD).

===Cuba, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Florida===
Strong northerly winds from Flora eroded the northern beaches in the Cuban province of Camagüey by up to . Santa Cruz del Sur reported strong southerly winds and rough seas. Winds in Cuba reached . Due to its slow movement across Cuba, the storm dropped extreme rainfall amounts on the eastern side of the island. Isolated locations in Cuba received over of precipitation, with Santiago de Cuba recording , which is the highest rainfall total measured on Cuba from any rainfall event on record. Strong winds and flooding caused significant damage to crops in the region. The storm destroyed about 25% of coffee, 10% of the corn, up to 15% of sugar crops throughout the country, while at least a majority of banana and orange crops were lost. Further, Flora destroyed an estimated 50% of winter rice crops in Camagüey and Oriente provinces – roughly 25% of production nationally. Approximately 50% of cotton was lost in Oriente Province, which produced about half of Cuba&#x27;s cotton crop.

Many citizens were left stranded at the tops of their homes. Floodwaters damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes throughout Cuba. A tabulation complete through October 20 indicated that the storm damaged approximately 21,000 homes and destroyed more than 11,000 others in Oriente Province alone. Throughout the country, the hurricane destroyed as many as 30,000 dwellings. Many bridges, highways, and railroads, particularly in Oriente Province, became impassable due to flooding, landslides, and washouts. However, much of the damage was incurred to secondary highways and railways. Overall, Flora caused about $500 million in damage in Cuba and approximately 1,750 fatalities.

Heavy rainfall fell across the island of Jamaica due to southwest flow into the mountains on Flora&#x27;s southern periphery over several days. The maximum amount recorded was at Spring Hill persistent, which led to numerous landslides across the eastern portion of the island. Damage to the island totaled $11.9 million (1963 dollars). Rough seas from Flora affected the Bahamas and the southeastern Florida coast on October 5 as the hurricane stalled over Cuba, keeping small craft in port, and hurricane-force winds affected Ragged Island later that day. Rainfall amounts peaked at at Duncan Town, in the Bahamas. Damage to the island archipelago reached $1.5 million (1963 dollars).

==Aftermath==
In Tobago, the great agricultural damage from Flora caused the crop plantations to be abandoned. As a result, the economy of the island changed towards tourism. The destruction of the Tobagonian rainforests resulted in a continual decline of agriculture on the island due to animals previously in the forest eating the crops for food. The passage of the hurricane reduced the height of the rainforest canopy above by half. Twenty-five years passed before the canopy reached its previous height.

In the Dominican Republic, damage reports were largely unknown by a month after the hurricane passed the island, primarily in the western provinces. There, roads were still impassable, large areas remained without electricity, and helicopters could not land in remote areas due to mud, silt, and up to of water in all landing fields. One official estimated several months would pass before survey teams could obtain information on loss of life and overall damages.

The government of Cuba implemented further restrictions on ongoing rations, including adding rations on sugar for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. Amidst a political crisis between Cuba and the United States, the Cuban Red Cross refused aid from the American Red Cross, referring to the offer of aid as hypocritical &quot;by a country [the United States] that is trying to destroy us [Cuba] with economic blockades and other measures.&quot; The Soviet Union delivered large quantities of food, medicine, and other supplies vital to recovery, while the other satellite states in Europe promised aid. China sent medicine and powdered milk totaling about $200,000 in value while also contributing the same amount in cash.

Due to the severe damage and loss of life the hurricane caused across the Caribbean, the name &quot;Flora&quot; was retired from the rotating list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names by the Weather Bureau in the fall of 1963. It was replaced with &quot;Fern&quot; for the 1967 season.

<text>Crushington is a town beside the Inangahua River in the West Coast region of New Zealand. 

The settlement is located three kilometres inland from Reefton, on the Lewis Pass road (State Highway 7) between the West Coast and north Canterbury.

The town was originally settled for quartz-mining at the Globe Mine, and was named for the pervasive sound of quartz being crushed by twenty stamps driven by a turbine water wheel.

Reed quotes G.G.M. Mitchell: &quot;Hour after hour, day after day, month after month for several years this crushing-battery kept pounding away at its job. Then one day the mine closed down and the battery stopped working at midnight. So inured had the children of Crushington become to the tremendous noise made by the battery that local history records that there was no sleep for any child of Crushington, so strange was the effect of the unusual silence on them.&quot;

Crushington was the birthplace of athlete John Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Lovelock, who went on to win a gold medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the 1500 m.

<doc id="987039" wikidata="Q58808" url="?curid=987039" title="Siberian Traps">
<text>The Siberian Traps () are a large region of volcanic rock, known as a large igneous province, in Siberia, Russia. The massive eruptive event that formed the traps is one of the largest known volcanic events in the last years.

The eruptions continued for roughly two million years and spanned the Permian–Triassic boundary, or P–T boundary, which occurred around 251.9 million years ago. The Siberian Traps are believed to be the primary cause of the Permian–Triassic extinction event, the most severe extinction event in the geologic record. Subsequent periods of Siberian Traps activity have been linked to a number of smaller biotic crises, including the Smithian-Spathian, Olenekian-Anisian, Middle-Late Anisian, and Anisian-Ladinian extinction events.

Large volumes of basaltic lava covered a large expanse of Siberia in a flood basalt event. Today, the area is covered by about of basaltic rock, with a volume of around .

==Etymology==
The term &quot;trap&quot; has been used in geology since 1785–1795 for such rock formations. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (&quot;trappa&quot;) and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.

==Formation==

The source of the Siberian Traps basaltic rock has been attributed to a mantle plume, which rose until it reached the bottom of the Earth&#x27;s crust, producing volcanic eruptions through the Siberian Craton. It has been suggested that, as the Earth&#x27;s lithospheric plates moved over the mantle plume (the Iceland plume), the plume had earlier produced the Viluy Traps to the east, then the Siberian Traps in the Permian and Triassic periods, and later going on to produce volcanic activity on the floor of the Arctic Ocean in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and then generating volcanic activity in Iceland. Other plate tectonic causes have also been suggested. Another possible cause may be the impact that formed the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica, which is estimated to have occurred around the same time and been nearly antipodal to the traps.

The main source of rock in this formation is basalt, but both mafic and felsic rocks are present, so this formation is officially called a Flood Basalt Province. The inclusion of mafic and felsic rock indicates multiple other eruptions that occurred and coincided with the one-million-year-long set of eruptions that created the majority of the basaltic layers. The traps are divided into sections based on their chemical, stratigraphical, and petrographical composition.

The Siberian traps are underlain by the Tungus Syneclise, a large sedimentary basin containing thick sequences of Early-Mid-Paleozoic-aged carbonate and evaporite deposits, as well as Carboniferous-Permian-aged coal-bearing clastic rocks. When heated, such as by igneous intrusions, these rocks are capable of emitting large amounts of toxic and greenhouse gases.

==Effects on prehistoric life==
One of the major questions is whether the Siberian Traps were directly responsible for the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event that occurred 250 million years ago, or if they were themselves caused by some other, larger event, such as an asteroid impact. One hypothesis put forward is that the volcanism triggered the growth of &quot;Methanosarcina&quot;, a microbe that then emitted large amounts of methane into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, ultimately altering the Earth&#x27;s carbon cycle based on observations such as a significant increase of inorganic carbon reservoirs in marine environments. Recent research has highlighted the impact of vegetative deposition in the preceding Carboniferous period on the severity of the disruption to the carbon cycle.

This extinction event, also colloquially called the Great Dying, affected all life on Earth, and is estimated to have led to the extinction of about 81% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species living at the time. Some of the disastrous events that affected the Earth continued to repeat themselves five to six million years after the initial extinction occurred. Over time, a small portion of the life that survived the extinction was able to repopulate and expand, starting with low trophic levels (producers) until the higher trophic levels (consumers) were able to be re-established. Calculations of sea water temperature from &quot;δ&quot;18O measurements indicate that, at the peak of the extinction, the Earth underwent lethally hot global warming, in which equatorial ocean temperatures exceeded . It took roughly eight to nine million years for any diverse ecosystem to be re-established; however, new classes of animals were established after the extinction that did not exist beforehand.

Palaeontological evidence further indicates that the global distribution of tetrapods vanished between latitudes approximating 40° south to 30° north, with very rare exceptions in the region of Pangaea that is today Utah. This tetrapod gap of equatorial Pangaea coincides with an end-Permian-to-Middle-Triassic global &quot;coal gap&quot; that indicates the loss of peat swamps. Peat formation, a product of high plant productivity, was reestablished only in the Anisian stage of the Triassic, and even then only in high southern latitudes, although gymnosperm forests appeared earlier (in the Early Spathian), but again only in northern and southern higher latitudes. In equatorial Pangaea, the establishment of conifer-dominated forests was not until the end of the Spathian, and the first coals at these latitudes did not appear until the Carnian, around 15 million years after their end-Permian disappearance. These signals suggest that equatorial temperatures exceeded the thermal tolerance for many marine vertebrates at least during two thermal maxima, whereas terrestrial equatorial temperatures were sufficiently severe to suppress plant and animal abundance during most of the Early Triassic.

==Dating==

The volcanism that occurred in the Siberian Traps resulted in copious amounts of magma being ejected from the Earth&#x27;s crust—leaving permanent traces of rock from the same time period of the mass extinction that can be examined today. More specifically, zircon is found in some of the volcanic rocks. To improve the accuracy of the age of the zircon, several variously-aged pieces of zircon were organized into a timeline based on when they crystallized. The CA-TIMS technique, a chemical abrasion age-dating technique that eliminates variability in accuracy due to lead depletion in zircon over time, was then used to accurately determine the age of the zircons found in the Siberian Traps. Eliminating the variability due to lead, the CA-TIMS age-dating technique allowed uranium within the zircon to be the centre focus in linking the volcanism in the Siberian Traps that resulted in high amounts of magmatic material with the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.

To further the connection with the Permian–Triassic extinction event, other disastrous events occurred around the same time period, such as sea level changes, meteor impacts, and volcanism. Specifically focusing on volcanism, rock samples from the Siberian Traps and other southern regions were obtained and compared. Basalts and gabbro samples from several southern regions close to and from the Siberian Traps were dated with the argon-argon method. Feldspar and biotite were specifically used to focus on the samples&#x27; ages and duration of the presence of magma from the volcanic event in the Siberian Traps. The majority of the basalt and gabbro samples dated to 250 million years ago, covered a surface area of on the Siberian Traps, and occurred within a short period of time with rapid rock solidification and cooling. Studies confirmed that samples of gabbro and basalt from the same time period of the Permian–Triassic event from the other southern regions also matched the age of samples within the Siberian Traps. This confirms the assumption of the linkage between the age of volcanic rocks within the Siberian Traps, along with rock samples from other southern regions to the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event.

==Mineral deposits==

The giant Norilsk-Talnakh nickel–copper–palladium deposit formed within the magma conduits in the most complete part of the Siberian Traps. It has been linked to the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which occurred approximately 251.4 million years ago, based on large amounts of nickel and other elements found in rock beds that were laid down after the extinction occurred. The method used to correlate the extinction event with the surplus amount of nickel located in the Siberian Traps compares the timeline of the magmatism within the traps and the timeline of the extinction itself. Before the linkage between magmatism and the extinction event was discovered, it was hypothesized that the mass extinction and volcanism occurred at the same time due to the linkages in rock composition.

<doc id="987047" wikidata="Q6942017" url="?curid=987047" title="Music of Bermuda">
<text>The music of Bermuda is often treated as part of the Caribbean music area. Its musical output includes pop singer Heather Nova, and her brother Mishka. Collie Buddz has also gained international success with reggae hits in the US and the UK.

The island&#x27;s musical traditions also include steelpan, calypso, choral music, as well as an array of bagpipe music played by descendants of Irish and Scottish settlers; the biggest bagpipe band on modern Bermuda is the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band. Bermuda is also the home of one of the most popular Caribbean music groups in the United States, the Bermuda Strollers.

The islands are also home to gombey dancers, reggae, gospel music, drum majorette bands, jazz and other styles.

== Folk music ==
Bermuda is home to several folk traditions, including pipe bands, the &quot;gombey&quot; dance and a ballad song.

=== Gombey ===
The Gombey dance is an iconic symbol of Bermudan culture. It mixes elements of British, West African and indigenous New World cultures. Traditionally in Gombey, dancers are black and male (though in modern times, female groups have emerged) and their father has to have been a Gombey dancer. They perform in groups of 10-30 in wild masquerade costumes with brilliant colors and odd angles, meant to evoke the plumage of tropical birds; they are sometimes based on Bible verses. &quot;Gombey&quot; dances are taught orally, through family members. The dances are energetic, and grow swifter gradually, while the spectators become more wild and energetic. The &quot;gombey&quot; tradition is at its liveliest during the Christmas season, and is also performed during Boxing Day, Easter, New Year&#x27;s Day, football and cricket matches and other festivals and celebrations.

The word &quot;Gombey&quot; is related to the Bahamian &quot;Goombay&quot;, a similar dance tradition. It also refers to a specific drum of African origin (see List of Caribbean drums). In addition to the Bahamian Goombay tradition, Gombey is similar to some other Afro-Caribbean styles and celebrations (such as the Mummers). Afro-Caribbeans brought to Bermuda as slaves or convicts during colonial times introduced other Caribbean traditions.

=== Ballad ===
Bermuda&#x27;s ballad tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, though it remains popular among a devoted subculture on the island. The Bermudan ballad is characterized by &quot;wry, self-deprecating humor&quot;, often improvised, and concerned with the rapid change of Bermudan culture.

The most famous Bermudan balladeer is Hubert Smith, a popular local composer who performed for many visiting royalty and foreign heads of state. He is also the composer of &quot;Bermuda Is Another World&quot;, an unofficial anthem for the island.

=== Bagpipe music ===
Bermuda has a strong Scottish and Irish cultural presence, and is home to well-known bagpipe bands that draw on those traditions, especially the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band. The bagpipe tradition was brought to Bermuda by Scottish and Irish soldiers from the 18th to the 20th centuries.

There were, until relatively recently, two major bagpipe bands in Bermuda, the Bermuda Cadets Pipe Band and the Bermuda Police Pipe Band. Both bands formed in 1955 and disbanded in 1992, the same year the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band was formed. Other historically important bagpipe bands include the Salvation Army Young People&#x27;s Band, which dates back to the 1930s.

== Choirs ==
Religious choir singing is also popular on Bermuda. Well-known choirs include the Roman Catholic Diocesan Choir, the Mt. Zion Male Voice Choir, as well as the non-church choirs Philharmonic Choir and Post Office Choir.

== Calypso ==
Calypso first became a part of Bermuda music in the 1940s and 50s. It was imported from Trinidad and Tobago. The Talbot Brothers were the island&#x27;s first major calypsonians; they organized as a group in 1942, and began touring the United States by the early 1950s.

Norman Luboff followed in the footsteps of Jamaican-American calypso singer Harry Belafonte in popularizing Trinidadian calypso. Luboff de-emphasized the saucy, ribald side of calypso and created a popular form that appealed to the masses. His signature song is &quot;Yellow Bird&quot; which became very popular in the 1960s. Genuine Bermudian calypso can only be found on the fine &quot;Bermuda Gombey &amp; Calypso 1953-1960&quot;. A detailed history of Bermuda calypso and gombey written by Bruno Blum can be read in the CD booklet (available online in both French and English). Artists include Sidney Bean, The Talbot Brothers, Reuben McCoy, Hubert Smith, The Four Deuces, Al Harris, Erskine Zuill and jazzman Lance Hayward, the first musician ever produced by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.

== Rock ==
Being close to the United States, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll is also popular. Bermuda&#x27;s most famous rock group was The Savages, a garage band that are considered important in the genre, especially by collectors, and foreshadowed 1970s punk. Their biggest single was The World Ain&#x27;t Round, It&#x27;s Square.

== Steelpan ==
Steelpan music was invented in the late 1930s in Trinidad, and was brought to Bermuda by a number of groups, including the Esso Steel Band, who moved to Bermuda in the 1950s. Esso became known for arranging Western classical music for the steelpan. In the 1960s, local choral traditions were merged with calypso and steelpan to create a distinctively Bermudian style.

Paul A.W. Smith and De Onion Patch Crew are a new steelpan group who perform newer hits like soca and R&amp;B music on steelpan.

== Music institutions ==
Bermuda is home to the Bermuda Ballet Association, which was founded by Patricia Gray in 1962, with support from Ana Roje. Other music institutions include the Bermuda National Youth Jazz Ensemble and the Bermuda Philharmonic Orchestra. There is also a Bermuda Folk Club. There is a Portuguese Cultural Association which promotes the culture of the large Portuguese population on Bermuda, especially tradition folk dances of the Azores. The Bermuda Philharmonic conductor is Gary Burgess, a former opera singer. Bermuda has also produced notable classical musicians in Marcelle Clamens, an opera singer, mezzo-soprano Jane Farge, pianists Peter Carpenter and Karol Sue Reddington, and Joyce Mary Helen DeShield.

<doc id="987057" wikidata="Q4927945" url="?curid=987057" title="Hurricane Cleo">
<text>Hurricane Cleo was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the third named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season. Cleo was one of the longest-lived storms of the season. This compact yet powerful hurricane travelled through the Caribbean Sea and later hit Florida before moving offshore Georgia into the Carolinas, killing 156 people and causing roughly $187 million in damage. Major damage was seen as far north as east-central Florida, with the heaviest rains falling along the immediate coast of the Southeast United States into southeast Virginia.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on August 15, 1964, moved westward, not organizing into a tropical depression until around east of Barbados on August 20–as reported by a Navy reconnaissance plane. It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane the next day with a minimum central pressure of 993 mb. Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a Category 3 hurricane. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of on August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic. It maintained that intensity for 18 hours, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough to move on to the Southwest Peninsula of Haiti. The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.

Cleo weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before hitting southern Cuba on August 26. It crossed the island quickly. Shortly after emerging from the north coast of Cuba, Cleo restrengthened to a hurricane, having weakened to a tropical storm while over Cuba. Cleo quickly intensified to a Category 2 hurricane before hitting the Miami, Florida area on August 27. It weakened to a tropical storm while over Florida later that day. The center moved offshore between Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida, before moving back onshore near Savannah, Georgia on August 29 without any increase in intensity. Its northward path along the Florida coast was unusual for the month of August.

Cleo continued to weaken as it moved through the Carolinas, drifting through as a tropical depression. After bringing heavy rain through the area, Cleo exited into the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk, Virginia, and quickly intensified to a tropical storm again on September 1. The following day, Cleo became a hurricane again, but it remained well offshore and did not cause any further damage. Cleo was last noted on September 5 northeast of Newfoundland.

==Preparation==
Early on August 21 hurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados and the Windward Islands. On August 22 hurricane warnings were in effect for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with hurricane watches in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. By August 23, hurricane watches remained in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued for Jamaica on August 24. By August 26 a hurricane watch had been raised from Key Largo, Florida to West Palm Beach, Florida. In advance of Cleo, the second stage of the Titan II/Gemini 2 launch vehicle was taken down and stored in a hangar on August 26 to protect it from the storm. Early on August 27, hurricane warnings extended northward to Cape Kennedy, Florida with gale warnings northward to Daytona Beach, Florida. Hurricane warnings were in effect northward to Brunswick, Georgia early on August 28 with a hurricane watch in effect between Brunswick, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. The hurricane watch for portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts continued into August 29.

==Impact==
===Guadeloupe===
Official reports from Guadeloupe indicated 14 dead, 40 injured, 1,000 homes destroyed and extensive damage to the island&#x27;s infrastructure. The hurricane devastated sugar and banana plantations. One C-124 aircraft delivered seven tons of relief supplies to the island.

===Greater Antilles===
Moderate to heavy rains fell across Puerto Rico, peaking at at Matrullas Dam. The outer bands of Cleo produced peak sustained winds of at Point Tuna, Puerto Rico. Offshore Puerto Rico on its initial penetration of Cleo on August 23, a Lockheed WC-121N Super Constellation used as a reconnaissance aircraft experienced its port wing tip fuel tank and portion of wing torn away by extreme updraft turbulence, which injured six of its crew. While trying to exit the storm, the starboard tip tank and larger portion of wing were torn away by extreme down draft turbulence. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Cleo led to the wettest known 24‑hour period recorded for any site within the Dominican Republic for any month, with falling at Polo. Les Cayes, Haiti was leveled as the storm struck the town. The aircraft carrier U.S.S. Boxer arrived off the coast of Hispaniola on August 29 to provide medical aid and evacuation services to those in the worst impacted areas of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Damage in Cuba was minimal because the hurricane had weakened and moved through quickly.

===Florida===

The hurricane was the first to directly strike Miami since Hurricane King in the 1950 season. Cleo intensified rapidly just prior to landfall, bringing sustained winds of with gusts to to the Miami area, due to moving over water temperatures of 30 to 32 degrees Celsius and its compact size. Lightning was observed within the eyewall at the National Hurricane Center. The pressure fell to 967.6 mb (28.57 inches) in North Miami. Major damage was constrained to a wide strip from Miami to Melbourne, in the form of broken glass, interior flooding, uprooted trees, overturned aircraft, power failures, and agriculture. Cleo cut power to 620,000 homes and businesses in southeast Florida. In Miami Shores the electricity was out for five days. At least two dozen fires blazed across Miami. About a quarter of the grapefruit crop was lost within the Indian River citrus producing region. The storm surge reached between Miami and Pompano Beach. The highest rainfall total measured within Florida was at Stuart.

The Sebastian River Baptist Church had its roof torn off during the cyclone.
Minor damage occurred north of Melbourne. Heavy rains fell along the east coast of the state, along and east of its track. Three tornadoes were reported with the storm within the state borders.

Cleo caused the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News&quot;, one of South Florida&#x27;s biggest newspapers, to miss publishing, the only time that happened in its history. Storyland, a popular children&#x27;s theme park in Pompano Beach, was destroyed and never rebuilt. A disaster declaration for Florida was made on September 8. Florida Atlantic University&#x27;s grand opening to students was delayed six days due to Cleo.

===Southeast United States===
Heavy rains spread up along the Georgia coast into the Carolinas and southern Virginia in association with the weakening tropical storm. Interaction with a frontal boundary to its north led to significant rains across extreme southeast Virginia to the left of its track exceeding in the Norfolk metropolitan area. This helped lead to double the average rainfall for the month of September for southeast Virginia. Seven tornadoes were reported within South Carolina, while North Carolina witnessed three tornado touchdowns.

===Retirement===

The name &quot;Cleo&quot; was later retired by the Weather Bureau. It was replaced with &quot;Candy&quot; for the 1968 season.

==Aftermath==
After surviving Cleo&#x27;s wrath in the Bahamas, a survivor came up with the idea of a floating hospital designed to help out areas after a catastrophe. A husband-wife pair who survived Cleo bought a retired luxury liner for such a purpose 14 years later, and it was put into service in 1982. Virginia Beach, Virginia fought to build a drainage canal to help drain the Lynnhaven flood zone after Cleo&#x27;s flooding rains struck the region. Over the objection of those in North Carolina, the canal was built. The result of the creation of this canal was an increase in salinity of nearly fivefold from pre-canal levels, which decimated aquatic vegetation in Currituck Sound by 1998. As a result, black bass disappeared from Currituck Sound.

<doc id="987067" wikidata="Q6942403" url="?curid=987067" title="Music of the Turks and Caicos Islands">
<text>The music of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] is best known for its ripsaw music. It is accompanied by an array of instruments, including maracas, triangles, box guitar, conga drums, goat and cowskin drums, accordion, concertina and, most prominently and uniquely, the carpenter saw.

The saw is scraped with a metal object, such as a screwdriver, to produce a unique sound; this is called &quot;ripping the saw&quot;. The use of the saw (which is the origin of the term &quot;ripsaw&quot;) is of uncertain origin, but may be in imitation of the Dominican and Haitian guiro or traditional African instruments such as the shekere and djembe.

A closely related style called rake and scrape is known in the Bahamas, closely associated with Cat Island, the home of many Turks and Caicos islanders, who moved there looking for work in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Many Bahamian musicians are from the islands, including The Cooling Waters, Sly Roker, Bradley Dean, Marvin Handfield, Perry Delancy, and Leo Jones. Many of these expatriates have since returned to Turks and Caicos, bringing with them Bahamian junkanoo music.

Modern ripsaw pioneers include Tell and the Rakooneers and Lovey Forbes, who created a new style called combina in the early 1980s, using genres from across the Caribbean and the US as inspiration; these included jazz, calypso, soca and reggae.

==Musician institutions==
The organisation TUCA helps to promote Turks and Caicos folk music and dance. The Turks and Caicos Music and Poetry Festival is a major annual event, attracting such artists as (in 2004) Chaka Khan, Maxi Priest, Boyz II Men, Joe, Shocking Vibes Band, TCI All Star Band and Blakout Crew. The first First Annual Turks &amp; Caicos Ripsaw Festival was held in 2003.

<doc id="987070" wikidata="Q5947766" url="?curid=987070" title="Hurricane Hilda">
<text>Hurricane Hilda was an strong tropical cyclone that ravaged areas of the United States Gulf Coast, particularly Louisiana. In addition to its damage inland, the hurricane greatly disrupted offshore oil production, and at its time was the costliest tropical cyclone for Louisiana&#x27;s offshore oil production. Due in part to flights made by the National Hurricane Research Laboratory, Hilda became one of the most well-documented storms meteorologically in the Atlantic. Lasting for seven days as a tropical cyclone, Hilda caused US$126 million in damage and 38 deaths. It was the tenth named storm, sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season.

Hilda developed over the southern shores of Cuba on September 28 as a tropical depression, tracking westward in an area of favorable conditions and reaching tropical storm intensity the next day. Once situated in the Gulf of Mexico, Hilda strengthened into a hurricane and began a slow trawl northward, rapidly intensifying to its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on October 1, making it a Category 4 hurricane. Slight weakening occurred as Hilda made landfall on the southern Louisiana coast on October 3. After reaching land, the hurricane took a sharp turn eastward and rapidly weakened as a result of land interaction and the presence of cool, dry air. The weakened remnants of Hilda merged with a cold front a day after landfall and dissipated on October 5.

Originating near Cuba, the cyclone intensified while moving through the Gulf of Mexico, and became a Category 4 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico before striking Louisiana in early October. In combination with a frontal zone located across the Southeast United States, the hurricane spread heavy rains through the South through the Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic States. Hilda led to significant damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as $126 million (1964 USD) in damage, and 38 deaths.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Hilda can be definitively traced back to a tropical wave that trekked across the western Caribbean Sea during the last week of September. However, a loosely defined mass of clouds east of the Lesser Antilles on September 23 was potentially associated with the formation of Hilda. Tracking westward, the area of convection gradually intensified, with hints at a well-defined circulation as the system tracked over Haiti on September 27. By 1200 UTC on September 28, the disturbance had become sufficiently defined to be classified as a tropical depression south of Cuba. Tracking generally westward, the depression crossed Cape San Antonio, Cuba on September 29, intensifying to tropical storm strength in the meanwhile before moving into the northern Yucatán Channel. Favorable conditions for tropical cyclone development in the western Caribbean, including the presence of abnormally high sea surface temperatures, allowed for the further strengthening of Hilda.

Hilda&#x27;s crossing of western Cuba slightly disrupted the intensification of the tropical cyclone, but strengthening resumed shortly thereafter. Upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico later of September 29, Hilda began to track very slowly at an average speed of , later meeting the threshold of hurricane intensity at 1200 UTC on September 30. During that time, atmospheric conditions over the Gulf of Mexico rapidly improved; a preexisting belt of strong wind shear, which would have inhibited further cyclonic strengthening, disintegrated coincident with Hilda&#x27;s passage of the gulf. Rapid intensification ensued on October 1, and by 0600 UTC that day Hilda became a major hurricane. Twelve hours later, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of based on reconnaissance flights. During this phase the storm was centered roughly south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Around the same time, an abnormally strong trough centered over Mississippi began to sharply curve the forward motion of Hilda towards the north.

Following peak intensity, further strengthening was inhibited due to the emergence of a high pressure area over the United States Gulf Coast. The presence of this system injected dry air into Hilda, gradually weakening the hurricane. The once prominent eye of the storm clouded over as a result of this advection. During the evening hours of October 3, around 23:00 UTC, Hilda made landfall on the central Louisiana coast near Calumet with a minimum pressure of and maximum sustained winds of , making a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air; by 0600 UTC on October 4, Hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity. The same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced Hilda eastward, resulting in the storm&#x27;s merging with a cold front and thus transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. These extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before they were last noted north of The Bahamas on October 7.

==Preparations==
The first hurricane watches or warnings issued by the Weather Bureau in association with Hilda were issued on October 1, when the agency issued a hurricane watch for the coast of Louisiana to Mobile, Alabama. This prompted the Texas Department of Public Safety to issue a standby alert for the Texas coast. On October 3, the Weather Bureau upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning, and expanded it to include the entire Texas Coastal Bend eastward to Mobile, Alabama. As Hilda neared the coast, the scope of the warning was narrowed to include only areas of the Louisiana Gulf Coast eastward to Mobile, Alabama and a gale warning for an extent of the United States Gulf Coast from Mobile Bay to Panama City, Florida. By the afternoon of October 4, hurricane warnings were lowered but gale warnings remained in place.

Evacuation of offshore oil platforms began as early as September 29. The majority of the 2,000 oil workers were evacuated on September 30 and October 1. Along the United States Gulf Coast, approximately 150,000 people evacuated. The U.S. Office of Civil Defense and three companies of the Louisiana National Guard were assigned to areas of the coast expedite the evacuation process. Areas lining Lake Pontchartrain were almost entirely evacuated. Re-purposed boxcars were used to move 3,400 evacuees northward from New Orleans and Franklin, Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation order was placed for a section of the coast of St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, with shuttle buses assisting in evacuating refugees to Opelousas, Louisiana. The United States Red Cross transported 10,000 cots to evacuation centers in Opelousas to serve the evacuees. Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana were sites of mass exodus with Hilda approaching the coast. Evacuation out of Cameron was disrupted by the lack of a bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway, and thus had to be conducted via ferry. Heads of cattle were among those evacuating from Cameron Parish in fears of a repeat of Hurricane Audrey, which had killed 35,000 cattle. Similarly, all residents of Pecan Island, Louisiana were evacuated. In Grand Isle, Louisiana, approximately 80% of the population evacuated.

Though not directly at threat from Hilda, residents of Sabine Pass, Texas were evacuated to nearby towns in fears that roads linking the city to the mainland may be cut off by the hurricane&#x27;s storm surge. A permanent off-shore drilling platform offshore of Galveston, Texas was brought back to shore. Schools along the coast of Louisiana including Nicholls State University and Tulane were suspended in anticipation of the hurricane. In Jackson, Mississippi, a federal disaster office was opened to coordinate preparation and relief efforts for Mississippi. The United States Atomic Energy Commission delayed a detonation of a nuclear bomb in the Tatum Salt Dome near Hattiesburg. The United States Navy scrammed planes from its air stations in Meridian, Mississippi and New Orleans, Louisiana in anticipation of Hilda.

The motor ship &quot;Cornelia B III&quot;, carrying a truck on deck, encountered Hilda&#x27;s rough surf and winds as it traversed the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the truck being washed overboard. As Hilda tracked northward through the Gulf of Mexico, the storm threatened an estimated $350 million worth of offshore oil drilling facilities. Hilda would become the most destructive tropical cyclone to Louisiana&#x27;s offshore oil industry at the time of its impact, accruing losses over $100 million. Strong winds and heavy surf destroyed thirteen oil platforms and damaged five beyond repair. All but one of the lost oil rigs were built to withstand a &quot;25-year storm&quot;, with the other constructed to withstand a &quot;100-year storm&quot;. Oil spills resulting from the affected rigs released 11,869 barrels of crude oil into the gulf. Despite widespread evacuation of offshore drilling platforms, the 14 crewmembers of the &quot;Ocean Driller&quot; managed to ride out the storm, at times withstanding winds as high as .

===United States===
====Gulf Coast====
=====Louisiana=====
The majority of deaths associated with Hilda in Louisiana were a result of tornadoes spawned by the hurricane in its outer peripheral rainbands and squall lines, which began tracking across the region on October 3. Six tornadoes and two waterspouts occurred in Louisiana due to the hurricane. Despite tracking for only near Larose, Louisiana, a violent F4 tornado killed 22 people and injured 165 others, destroying 35 homes in the process. Automobiles in the path of the twister were also damaged. Debris picked up by the tornado was found away in the Coteau-Bayou Blue area, or 3 miles east of Houma. This was the second of only two violent tornado ever spawned by a hurricane with the first one coming from Hurricane Carla in 1961. No other tornado in the state resulted in deaths, though multiple twisters in the New Orleans metropolitan area caused extensive damage to several automobiles and buildings and injured five. The same tornadoes also knocked down power lines, knocking out power in localized areas. KLEB was knocked off the air as a result of these outages.

Data from the hardest hit areas along the central Louisiana coast remains sparse due to the small population density of the area. Storm surge unofficially peaked at at the Point Au Fer Reef Light. At the mouth of the Mississippi River, tides reached as high as above mean sea level. The strongest wind report was from Franklin, Louisiana, where a station clocked sustained winds of . Near the coast in Erath, a high water tower succumbed to Hilda&#x27;s strong winds and collapsed onto an adjacent town hall where civil defense personnel were operating. The incident resulted in the deaths of eight and six injuries. Although there were no stations to report the intensity of winds in Erath, winds away in Abbeville reached . Hilda&#x27;s sharp curve eastward after landfall and the advection of cold air from the north resulted in gusty winds over the New Orleans area, causing waves to break and spill over the seawall protecting the city from Lake Pontchartrain. The resulting waterfront flooding damaged fishing camps and other shoreline property. Elsewhere in southeastern Louisiana, strong winds stripped pecans and other nuts off of trees.

Despite Hilda&#x27;s intensity at landfall, much of the damage attributed to the hurricane was a result of heavy rains associated with the storm and its interaction with a nearby frontal boundary. Rainfall caused by the storm peaked at northwest of Jeanerette. The strong winds and rain caused extensive crop damage; 98% of Louisiana&#x27;s sugar crop sustained some measure of damage. Although most of the state&#x27;s cotton crop was harvested prior to Hilda&#x27;s landfall, the heavy rains flattened unpicked cotton in southern Louisiana, resulting in US$10 million in damage. Overall, the effects of Hilda in Louisiana destroyed or heavily damaged nearly 2,600 residences and inflicted minor damage on an additional 19,000. The United States Red Cross estimated that about 5,000 people were injured and that of those 357 were hospitalized.

=====Elsewhere=====

Effects in Texas were minimal, with gusts peaking at near High Island, Texas and areas of the state receiving trace amounts of precipitation at most. Damage was limited to the portions of the coast which were hit by a minor storm surge peaking at above mean sea level at Freeport. Some piers and arterial beach roads adjacent to the coast were damaged. Portions of Texas State Highway 87 on the Bolivar Peninsula were inundated by floodwater. Minor property damage occurred, and no persons were injured in Texas.
Tracking across the southern areas of Mississippi, Hilda and later its remnants brought torrential rainfall to central and southern portions of the state. The McComb-Pike County Airport received of rain, the highest precipitation total statewide. The heavy rains resulted in record rainfall totals for the month of October in several locations and flash floods. However, the majority of damage in the state was a result of strong northerly winds, which caused power outages and was destructive to the state&#x27;s pecan and corn crops, which had been nearing harvest. Cotton crops that were harvested prior to the passage of Hilda were largely damaged. Power outages knocked out 460 telephone circuits and over 30,000 individual telephones. Strong winds also uprooted and felled trees and their limbs in addition to as well as a tall radio mast near Moss Point, Mississippi. As a result of Hilda, 20 people were injured and damage exceeded $50,000. Three of those injuries were a result of a tornado which struck areas of Pearl River County, destroying a home, two barns, and a pumping station. Across Mississippi, over 14,000 homes were damaged, of which 3,000 were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed.

Interacting with a cold front as it traversed Alabama, the remnants of Hilda caused gusts as strong as in Mobile and Baldwin counties, downing telecommunication lines, uprooting trees, and shattering windows. Piers lining Mobile Bay were either destroyed or damaged. Five people were injured in those two counties. Strong winds in Russell and Lee counties damaged or destroyed several buildings, injuring four. In addition to straight-line winds, three tornadoes occurred across six counties in Alabama, with one injuring three people after damaging five homes, a hospital, and a plant. Although rainfall peaked well inland at , damage as a result of rain was limited to the coast, where the combination of high tides and rain resulted in minor coastal inundation. As the remnants of Hilda moved across the Florida Panhandle on October 4–5, rough surf was produced, with high tides causing minor tidal inundation along the Florida coast. One person drowned in the high surf produced by the storm off of Pensacola, Florida on October 4. Squalls in western and northern Florida produced heavy rain, with a maximum occurring in Wewahitchka, which received . The precipitation produced localized flooding in the Tallahassee area. The squalls also produced strong winds, at times gusting to near Pensacola. A station at Naval Air Station Pensacola clocked a gust. These winds caused minor damage limited to uprooted trees and broken limbs.

====East Coast====
Rainfall from the remnants of Hilda extended as far northeast as Delaware as a result of the remnants interacting with a frontal boundary that extended across the United States East Coast. Extremely torrential rains fell over Georgia, peaking at south of Waynesboro. The largest precipitation totals occurred in the state&#x27;s northeastern extremities, where widespread totals of or higher were reported. The rains resulted in flash flooding, causing extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure across Georgia. The excess floodwater caused streams to overflow their banks. At least 30 bridges were washed away by these swollen streams, and several county roads were washed out. The most considerable damage was reported in northeastern Georgia, coincident with the high rainfall totals there. Damage in Rabun County alone exceeded US$100,000. In addition to infrastructure damage, thousands of acres of farmland were inundated.

Torrential rainfall continued northeastwards into the Carolinas, with statewide rainfall peaking at and in North and South Carolina, respectively. The rains in North Carolina exacerbated preexisting flood conditions which had previously caused widespread agricultural and infrastructural damage as well as soil erosion. Though not directly a result of Hilda&#x27;s remnants, they were likely influenced by the storm&#x27;s interaction with a frontal boundary. Already overflowing rivers and streams rose even further, reaching near-record levels. Raleigh experienced severe flooding, and roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes due to dangerous floodwaters. Two cars in mountainous regions were swept into inundated areas during the floods, resulting in one death. Several tornadoes in six counties were also reported, injuring two. Extensive wind damage was reported in Wayne County.

Heavy rains in South Carolina from October 4–6 resulted in localized flash flooding, particularly near streams. In mountainous regions, runoff from precipitation caused the Keowee, Saluda, and tributaries of the Broad River to swell, inundated and causing substantial damage to adjacent agricultural land and roads, in addition to breaching several small dams. The flooding triggered landslides, killing one person. Counties in the coastal plains of South Carolina also experienced farmland, road, and residential damage due to the heavy rains.

==Retirement==

After the season, the Weather Bureau retired the name &quot;Hilda&quot; from future use in the Atlantic basin. It was replaced with &quot;Hannah&quot; for the 1968 season.

<doc id="987073" wikidata="Q2478274" url="?curid=987073" title="Tara Browne">
<text>Tara Browne (4 March 1945 – 18 December 1966) was an Irish socialite and heir to a part of the Guinness fortune. His December 1966 death in a car crash was referenced in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.

==Early life ==
Browne was the younger son of the 4th Baron Oranmore and Browne, who was also the 2nd Baron Mereworth, and Oonagh Guinness. His father, Lord Oranmore and Browne, was an Anglo-Irish peer and member of the House of Lords who served in that house for 72 years, longer than any other peer up to that time (ending only by eviction during government reforms in 1999). His mother, Oonagh Guinness, was an heiress to the Guinness fortune.

Browne was a member of Swinging London&#x27;s counterculture of the 1960s and had stood to inherit £1 million at age 25. In August 1963, at age 18, he married Noreen &quot;Nicky&quot; MacSherry; the couple had two sons, Dorian and Julian.

For his 21st birthday, he threw a &quot;lavish&quot; party at Luggala, the Gothic Browne family seat in the Wicklow Mountains, where &quot;two private jets flew the 200 or so guests to Ireland, including John Paul Getty, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones [and] Jones&#x27; then-girlfriend Anita Pallenberg.&quot;

Browne induced his friend Paul McCartney&#x27;s first LSD trip in 1966, at Browne&#x27;s home in Belgravia.

His life was captured in Paul Howard&#x27;s biography &quot;I Read the News Today, Oh Boy&quot;, published in 2016.

==Death==
On 17 December 1966, Browne was driving with his girlfriend, model Suki Potier, in his Lotus Elan through South Kensington at high speed (some reports suggesting in excess of 106 mph/170 km/h). He was under the influence of alcohol and other drugs at the time. Browne failed to see a traffic light and proceeded through the junction of Redcliffe Square and Redcliffe Gardens, colliding with a parked lorry. He died of his injuries the following day. Potier claimed that Browne swerved the car to absorb the impact of the crash to save her life.

Browne&#x27;s body was brought back to Ireland and buried on the Guinness family&#x27;s Luggala Estate. His grave is one of three situated on the shore of Lough Tay, next to an ornamental building known as the Temple; the two other people buried there are his unnamed baby brother, who was born and died in December 1943, and his half-sister. 

Following his death, his estranged wife launched a public legal battle for custody of their two young children; Browne&#x27;s mother also sought custody. A judge eventually ruled that the boys should live with their grandmother.

==&quot;A Day in the Life&quot;==

The death of Browne inspired some of the lyrics of the song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by the Beatles, which was released on their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In a 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, John Lennon said, &quot;I was reading the paper one day [...] the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car. That was the main headline story. He died in London in a car crash.&quot; Lennon, who was a friend of Browne, read the coroner&#x27;s verdict into Browne&#x27;s death while composing music at his piano. It was this news which inspired him to write the following lines:

In 1997, Paul McCartney gave a different explanation of these lines: However, in his 2021 book &quot;The Lyrics&quot;, McCartney confirmed that the lyrics were about the death of Tara Browne.

<doc id="987077" wikidata="Q4252980" url="?curid=987077" title="Quantum dot laser">
<text>A quantum dot laser is a semiconductor laser that uses quantum dots as the active laser medium in its light emitting region. Due to the tight confinement of charge carriers in quantum dots, they exhibit an electronic structure similar to atoms. Lasers fabricated from such an active media exhibit device performance that is closer to gas lasers, and avoid some of the negative aspects of device performance associated with traditional semiconductor lasers based on bulk or quantum well active media. Improvements in modulation bandwidth, lasing threshold, relative intensity noise, linewidth enhancement factor and temperature insensitivity have all been observed. The quantum dot active region may also be engineered to operate at different wavelengths by varying dot size and composition. This allows quantum dot lasers to be fabricated to operate at wavelengths previously not possible using semiconductor laser technology. One challenge in the further advances with quantum dot lasers is the presence of multicarrier Auger processes which increases the nonradiative rate upon population inversion. Auger processes are intrinsic to the material but, in contrast to bulk semiconductors, they can be engineered to some degree in quantum dots at the cost of reducing the radiative rate. Another obstacle to the specific goal of electrically-pumped quantum dot lasing is the generally weak conductivity of quantum dot films.

Devices based on quantum dot active media have found commercial application in medicine (laser scalpel, optical coherence tomography), display technologies (projection, laser TV), spectroscopy and telecommunications. A 10 Gbit/s quantum dot laser that is insensitive to temperature fluctuation for use in optical data communications and optical networks has been developed using this technology. The laser is capable of high-speed operation at 1.3 μm wavelengths, at temperatures from 20 °C to 70 °C. It works in optical data transmission systems, optical LANs and metro-access systems. In comparison to the performance of conventional strained quantum-well lasers of the past, the new quantum dot laser achieves significantly higher stability of temperature.

Newer, so called &quot;Comb lasers&quot; based on quantum dot lasers have been found to be capable of operating at wavelengths of ≥ 80 nm and be unaffected by temperatures between -20 °C and 90 °C, and allow higher accuracy with reduced fluctuations and less relative intensity noise.

In development are colloidal quantum dot lasers, which would use quantum confinement to change the optical properties of the semiconductor crystals (≤ 10 nm in diameter) through solution-based rearrangements of quantum dots.

<doc id="987081" wikidata="Q3246589" url="?curid=987081" title="Hurricane Celia">
<text>Hurricane Celia was the costliest tropical cyclone in Texas history until Hurricane Alicia in 1983. The third named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season, Celia developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on July 31. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwestward, crossing over western Cuba on August 1 and becoming Tropical Storm Celia. Heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding, leading to five fatalities. The storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, and due to the warm sea surface temperatures, Celia intensified into a hurricane later that day. Storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of Florida, especially the Panhandle, causing eight people to drown. On August 2 and early on August 3, Celia slightly weakened, however, the storm underwent rapid intensification and deepening, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane at landfall with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) later on August 3.

In Louisiana, tides caused minor coastal flooding. Minor erosion damage was reported along Highway 82 in Cameron Parish. Late afternoon on August 3, Celia made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Impact was the worst in Nueces County, which observed gusts as high as . In Corpus Christi, about one-third of houses suffered severe damage or were destroyed. Additionally, about 90% of the buildings in downtown were damaged to some degree. Celia weakened as it continued further inland and dissipated over New Mexico on August 6. The remnants of Celia brought up to of rainfall to the state. Overall, this storm caused 28 deaths and $930 million (1970 USD) in damage.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa in late July; a weather station in Dakar, Senegal observed a wind shift on July 23. The system moved quickly across the Atlantic at and reached the Lesser Antilles by July 28. The wave then continued moving rapidly westward across the Caribbean Sea. However, falling atmospheric pressures over the Southern United States eroded a subtropical ridge, causing the system to decelerate by July 30. Around that time, a closed circulation began to organize in the northwestern Caribbean between the Cayman Islands and Swan Island. At 0000 UTC on July 31, a tropical depression developed about 90 mi (145 km) west-southwest of Grand Cayman. The depression strengthened while heading north-northwestward, though a reconnaissance aircraft could not complete its mission on July 31 due to the depression&#x27;s proximity to Cuba.

On August 1, at 0000 UTC, the depression reached tropical storm intensity as it made landfall in western Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. A weather station in Cape San Antonio recorded a minimum barometric pressure of . After reaching the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 1, warm sea surface temperatures caused the storm to undergo rapid deepening. Later that day, the storm was named &quot;Celia&quot;, based on a reconnaissance flight observing tropical storm force winds. Satellite imagery indicated that Celia was becoming significantly more organized, and at 1800 UTC, the storm became a hurricane with winds. The storm reached an initial peak intensity with winds of from 0000 UTC to 1200 UTC on August 2, before slightly weakening. Celia&#x27;s pressure continued to drop, however, as its wind speeds remained steady, reaching a minimum of . Due to Celia&#x27;s steady west-northwestward motion across the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center marked that the storm &quot;aimed at the Corpus Christi area like a wild beast stalking its prey.&quot; Early on August 3, it weakened slightly further, with winds of and a pressure of .

As it turned towards the coast, Celia began to intensify very rapidly later on August 3, including a decrease in pressure in only 15 hours, and strengthened quickly right up to landfall along the Texas coast. At the time of landfall, which took place at 2100 UTC on August 3, Celia attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Celia &quot;maintained strength for an unusually long time&quot; after moving inland, weakening to a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on August 4. Early on the following day, the storm further weakened to a tropical depression. Celia dissipated over western Texas at 1800 UTC on August 5, though the remnants persisted until reaching New Mexico.

==Preparations==
In the Gulf of Mexico, oil rig crew workers began leaving and headed for land. Residents of Texas coastal towns of High Island, Port Bolivar, and Gilchrist were evacuated further inland. The National Hurricane Center also issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the coast of Texas in anticipation of the storm. At 1600 UTC on August 2, a hurricane warning was posted from Palacios to Port Arthur. About six hours later, the warning was extended southward to Rockport. The hurricane warning was expanded further southward to Corpus Christi at 1000 UTC on August 3.

Celia was initially forecast to stay well north of Corpus Christi. However, on August 3, the forecast depicted a direct hit on the city. With little warning, many residents did not have enough time to make correct preparations.

==Impact==

Celia caused 27 fatalities, four in Cuba, eight in Florida and 15 in Texas and left $930 million in damages. Corpus Christi, Texas suffered the worst impact, with at least 85% of all the structures in the city damaged, with 90% of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed. Additionally, about one-third of houses were severely damaged or flattened.

===Cuba and Florida===
As a tropical depression, Celia dropped heavy rains over western Cuba, resulting in major flooding. Four people drowned and another man was electrocuted in the water when he tried to retrieve a downed power line. While over the central Gulf of Mexico, strong rip currents and large swells affected Florida, measuring up to in the Panhandle. In Escambia County alone, at least 12 lifeguard rescues occurred. Pensacola Beach was closed to the public on September 3, after several rescues on the previous day. Eight people drowned due to adverse water conditions in the Florida Panhandle.

===Texas===

The most severe damage was in Corpus Christi and Aransas Pass. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and it damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Initially, losses were estimated to have reached $434 million. However, due to lower insurance rate of coverage, the original insured losses, $310 million, were tripled, rather than doubled. Thus, the damage toll was revised upward to $930 million in 2011. Damage to crops was slightly more than $8.8 million. In addition, Celia caused 15 fatalities and injured 466 others. The most severe damage occurred in the streaks of damage, not by tornadoes, but a series microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15-minute span. Survivors of the storm described the downbursts as &quot;rocket shells&quot; exploding. However, areas between the streaks suffered surprisingly little damage, mainly ornamental due to debris from the homes nearby. Celia dropped heavy rains as it made landfall. However, due to the small size and fast movement of the storm, precipitation was not widespread. At the time of landfall, much of Texas was suffering from a drought. Most areas received .

In Alvin, a small tornado caused the destruction of a few fences and moved a pickup truck. Downed trees caused slight property damage in Amistad Dam, a municipality in Val Verde County. Gusts between were reported within the Aransas County portion of Aransas Pass. In Artesia Wells, minimal damage occurred to property, reaching only $5,000. The storm damage some homes and 15% of crops in Austwell. Losses in that section of the city reached an estimated $20 million. Minor damage was inflicted on weak structures and shingle or metal roofs in Crystal City. Impact on trees and crops were minimal. Thus, the reported wind speeds of were considered &quot;doubtful&quot;.

Property damage in Del Rio was about $1 million, with wind impacts mostly to roofs, mobile homes, signs, boats, windows, trees, and homes under construction, while some businesses and homes were flooded. In Frio County, a tornado spawned in the Dilley area toppled utility poles, destroyed several chicken houses, and blew the roof of a house away. In addition, two farm houses were deroofed and several outhouses were damaged. Another tornado spawned nearby caused &quot;considerable&quot; damage to the Dilley Civic Center, destroyed machine sheds, unroofed outbuildings, and felled many electrical poles. Throughout Dilley, there was $250,000 in property damage and $350,000 in crop losses. An estimated $50,000  was inflected to property in Eagle Pass. Strong winds in George West caused damage to 90% of trees, some houses, and cotton crops. Damage estimates in the city range from $250,000–$500,000. In Gregory, property losses was about $1 million, while there was about $25,000 in damage to crops. Near Lake Corpus Christi, a man died after he was struck by debris from his house, which was hit by a tornado. Two other people were injured by that tornado and several homes were destroyed. The storm spawned at least 2 other tornadoes, those neither caused any known damage.

Damage in Langtry was very minor, reaching only $600. A tornado in Port O&#x27;Connor, destroyed a boat storage shed, which was owned by Cooperative Weather Observed Bill H. Young. In Refugio, a rancher observed wind gusts up to . About $707,500 in damage occurred to property, while crop losses reached $425,000. One injury was reported after a person was struck by flying glass. Wind gusts up to in Sandia damaged every house, 90% of cotton crops, and caused 1 fatality. Although wind gusts of were observed in Taft, only $5 million in property and $500,000 in crop damages were reported. In Tilden, the storm brought maximum sustained winds up to . As a result, the entire city lost telephone and electrical services and there was &quot;lots of damage&quot; to trees, 80% of houses, and roofs. Property damage reached about $3.4 million, while there was also $25,000 in crop losses. Property losses in Uvalde reached $100,000, while damage to crops was estimated at $250,000. Additionally, a tornado was spawned in Yoakum, though it apparently caused negligible impact.

====Nueces County====
The highest tides produced by the storm lashed Nueces County. Tides were and mean sea level at Port Aransas Beach and the Port Aransas Jetty, respectively. The heaviest rainfall totals observed from the storm also fell in Nueces County, with of precipitation reported in Robstown. Because rainfall was relatively light, minor, if any flood damage occurred. Strong winds were reported, with winds gusts measuring as high as and at the Corpus Christi Weather Bureau Office and Aransas Pass, respectively. Further inland, wind gusts were estimated to have reached at Robstown High School, as the oil derricks on the property, built to withstand winds of , were knocked down.

Due to high winds, 85% of the total property damage caused by the storm occurred in Corpus Christi, with 90% of the buildings in downtown either damaged or destroyed. About a third of the houses in the city had serious damage or were destroyed. The University of Corpus Christi, a private institution located on Ward Island, suffered so much damage that it could not afford to rebuild, and it was sold to the State in 1973. Just northeast of the Corpus Christi International Airport, several hundred mobile homes were ripped into small fragments, and the remains were scattered for hundreds of yards. Facilities owned by the Southwestern Bell Corporation (which later became AT&amp;T) suffered $10 million in losses. Another telephone company in the area, General Telephone Company, estimated $700,000 in damage occurred to its business. At the United States Army helicopter repair center in Corpus Christi, there were about $5 million in damage. Around 800–900 family housing units at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi were considered uninhabitable, indicating $35 million in losses at that location.

Two large Sunoco oil tanks and another owned by Humble Oil burned after possibly being struck by lightning. Approximately $17 million in losses occurred to both companies. Heavy property damage was also reported in rural areas, totaling slightly more than $20 million. At least 75% of the buildings in Port Aransas were damaged. Overall, 74% of property losses associated with Celia were in Nueces County.

===Elsewhere===
While crossing the Gulf of Mexico, Celia produced tides above normal on the southwestern coast of Louisiana. As a result, slight erosion of Louisiana Highway 82 occurred in Cameron Parish between Johnson Bayou and Holly Beach. No damage or fatalities were reported in that state. After dissipating, the remnants of Celia produced up to of rain in New Mexico, though no other impacts in the state are known.

==Aftermath==
Following the storm, then-President of the United States Richard Nixon declared seven counties in Texas as disaster areas – Aransas, Bee, Jim Wells, Live Oak, Nueces, Refugio, and San Patricio – allowing affected residents to be eligible for federal relief. Immediately, then-Governor of Texas Preston Smith sent National Guardsmen to the area to patrol and assist with recovery. About a week after the storm, Governor Smith stated that the most urgent need was financial assistance, and designated the American Red Cross as the official relief agency. The American Red Cross chapters in Colbert and Lauderdale counties in Alabama announced that they were accepting donations to send to southern Texas.

In Corpus Christi, officials applied to pollution control officers for permission to burn of debris. The University of Corpus Christi (UCC) suffered so much damage that repairs were not affordable. In May 1971, the Texas Legislature passed a bill to establish a Texas A&amp;I campus in Corpus Christi. Two years later, after local residents raised approximately $1.8 million to support the school, the UCC transferred its properties to Texas A&amp;I University (now known as Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi).

In addition, most homeowners insurance policies refused to write insurance for areas considered to be &quot;high risk&quot; along the Texas coast, prompting the state government to form the Texas Catastrophe Property Insurance Association, now known as the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. Today, TWIA offers coverage to the 14 coastal counties of Texas and a small portion of Harris County near Houston, Texas.

===Retirement===

Due to the severity of damage caused by the hurricane, the National Hurricane Center retired the name &quot;Celia&quot; following the 1970 season, and it will never be used again for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Carmen&quot; for the 1974 season.

<text>The province of Ferrara (; ) is a province in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. Its capital is the city of Ferrara. As of May 2023, it has a population of 338,143 inhabitants over an area of . The province contains 23 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;), listed in the list of &quot;comuni&quot; of the province of Ferrara. Its provincial president is Gianni Michele Padovani.

==History==
The province of Ferrara is believed to have been first settled in by the Romans at the site &quot;Forum Alieni&quot;, although remains of the coastal port of Spina have been unearthed near Comacchio by archaeologists. Ferrara was first mentioned when it was conquered by Germanic tribe the Lombards in 753 CE, and the Byzantine Empire lost its rule over the city. It was gifted to the Holy See by the Franks in either 754 or 756 CE, and was led by the Bishops of Ravenna. Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries started reclaiming Podeltan lands in the 9th century.

In 1055, the partially independent town of Fererra was given imperial powers, but was led by Matilda of Tuscany from 1101 and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1158. Members of the House of Este took control of the city during the 13th century, and formed a university in Ferrara in 1391. Walls were built around the perimeter of Ferrara in the 15th and 16th centuries. It joined the Papal States in 1598. Its citadel was occupied by the Austrians in 1831 after the Italian United Provinces were formed, and the Austrians occupied the city in 1847. On 21 June 1859 the Austrians left the city of Ferrara and it was able to join the Kingdom of Italy.

In 1921, Italo Balbo joined the newly created National Fascist Party and soon became a secretary of the Ferrara fascist organization. He began to organize Fascist gangs and formed his own group. They broke strikes for local landowners and attacked communists and socialists in the region. His success in Ferrara set in motion the rapid rise of Fascism in northern Italy and played an important role in the transformation of Fascism into a major political movement.

==Geography==
The province of Ferarra is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. It is the most northerly province in the region to abut onto the Adriatic Sea. The Province of Rovigo in the Veneto region lies immediately to the north and the Province of Mantua in Lombardy to the northwest. To the west lies the Province of Modena and the Province of Bologna, and the Province of Ravenna lies to the south. The provincial capital is the city of Ferrara, which is situated on a branch of the Po River about northeast of Bologna.

<doc id="987094" wikidata="Q3243984" url="?curid=987094" title="Hurricane Fifi–Orlene">
<text>Hurricane Fifi, later known as Hurricane Orlene, was a catastrophic tropical cyclone that killed over 8,000 people in Honduras in September 1974, ranking it as the third deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record, only behind Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and the 1780 hurricane. Fifi is also the first billion-dollar hurricane not to make landfall in the United States. Originating from a strong tropical wave on September 14, the system steadily tracked west-northwestward through the eastern Caribbean. On September 16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fifi just off the coast of Jamaica. The storm quickly intensified into a hurricane the following afternoon and attained its peak intensity on September 18 as a strong Category 2 hurricane. Maintaining hurricane intensity, Fifi brushed the northern coast of Honduras before making landfall in Belize the following day. The storm quickly weakened after landfall, becoming a depression late on September 20. Continuing westward, the former hurricane began to interact with another system in the eastern Pacific.

Early on September 22, Fifi re-attained tropical storm status before fully regenerating into a new tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Orlene. Orlene traveled in an arced path toward Mexico while quickly intensifying into a Category 2 hurricane before landfall. The storm weakened after landfall and dissipated fully during the afternoon of September 24 over the mountains of Mexico. Along its path, Fifi impacted nine countries, leaving over 8,200 fatalities and $1.8 billion (1974 USD; $  USD) in damages. Most of the loss of life and damage occurred in Honduras where rainfall from the hurricane, peaking around , triggered widespread flash flooding and mudslides.

In a single town, between 2,000 and 5,000 people were killed overnight after a massive flood inundated the area. Fifi brought continuous rainfall to the area for three days, hampering relief efforts in what was the worst disaster in Honduras&#x27; history at the time. In nearby Guatemala, an additional 200 people were killed by severe flooding, making Fifi the worst hurricane to impact the country in nearly 20 years. Following the catastrophic damage wrought by the storm, relief agencies from around the world flew in emergency supplies to assist the hundreds of thousands of homeless people. Countries closer to Honduras, such as the United States, set up city donation centers that would send supplies to the country. In efforts to prevent the spread of post-storm diseases, the government allowed the burning of bodies as they were recovered. In a single day, up to 6,000 bodies were burned. Due to the extreme damage and loss of life, the name was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names and has not been used since.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Fifi originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 8. As the storm entered the Atlantic, satellite imagery showed that the system was already well-developed. Traveling westward, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea by September 13. Soon after emerging into the Caribbean, convective activity quickly increased. The following day, a US Navy reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system and found a developing low-level circulation. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) until late on September 15; however, in the Atlantic hurricane database, it was determined that it had become a tropical depression during the afternoon of September 14. The NHC initially forecast the depression to continue its west-northwest track, eventually brushing Cuba, although the storm never took the northerly turn.

The depression continued to organize as it turned westward, and late on September 16 the system intensified into Tropical Storm Fifi while just south of Jamaica. As it moved due west, the storm intensified, attaining hurricane status roughly 24 hours after being named following the formation of an eyewall feature. At that time, the storm was asymmetrical, with gale-force winds extending up to to the north and up to to the south. The storm turned slightly southwestward, and by September 18, Fifi reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; ). This made Fifi a high-end Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, which had been adopted the previous year. Around this time, the hurricane had nearly doubled in size, with a gale diameter now covering an area across.
Although earlier in the season Hurricane Carmen had attained Category 4 status in a similar location, Fifi was unable to intensify further due to its proximity to land. Most of the southern portion of the circulation was inhibited by the mountains of Honduras as it passed within of the coast. Fifi maintained its peak intensity for roughly 24 hours until it began to weaken shortly before making landfall near Placencia, Belize with winds of . After moving inland, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm and further deteriorated into a tropical depression once it moved over southwestern Mexico late on September 20. Two days later, the former hurricane emerged back over water near Acapulco, Mexico, becoming the third known tropical cyclone to traverse Central America and enter the northeastern Pacific hurricane basin. When it moved back over open waters, Fifi re-attained tropical storm status; however, it only maintained this intensity for 18 hours before being renamed Orlene. There is disagreement amongst tropical cyclone forecasting agencies as to the role Fifi played in Orlene&#x27;s development.

After the formation or merger of the systems, Orlene began to intensify. During the afternoon of September 23, the storm intensified into a hurricane as it quickly traveled towards the north-northeast. Shortly before making landfall, a small eye developed within the center of the hurricane, resulting in the NHC upgrading it to a Category 2 storm with maximum winds of . However, the EPHC reported that the storm peaked with winds of . Rapid weakening took place following the storm&#x27;s landfall, degenerating into a remnant low just six hours after moving inland. The remnant system persisted for several more hours before dissipating over the mountains of Mexico.

==Preparations and impacts==
===Greater Antilles===
On September 15, the Government of Jamaica began preparing for potential impacts from the storm. Residents were advised to be aware of possible rain squalls in association with the storm. Additionally, small craft advisories were issued due to rough seas produced by the then-tropical depression. Passing south of Jamaica as a tropical storm, Fifi brought heavy rains to the mountainous island, exceeding in some locations. Severe flooding affected parts of Kingston, leaving some areas under of water. Damages from the storm amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars, although no loss of life was reported. In nearby Hispaniola, the system produced moderate rainfall that triggered flash flooding. Small craft advisories were also issued for portions of southern Cuba as Fifi bypassed Jamaica. Ships were advised to remain in port throughout the Cayman Islands as residents began to prepare for hurricane-force winds.

===Honduras===

Fifi first became a threat to Honduras on September 17 when the storm reached hurricane strength, at which point forecasters revised their forecasts to anticipate landfall in Honduras or Nicaragua on September 18 or 19. In response, officials in Honduras urged hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate from coastal and flood-prone areas. Despite the warning, relatively few heeded these evacuation orders, likely playing a role in the large loss of life following the storm.

During the first day of the hurricane&#x27;s onslaught, the region experienced winds of up to and unrelenting rainfall. The first reports of damage from the Honduran government via radio stated that 14 people had been killed while over 100 were missing. In just 24 hours, 182 towns and villages were completely destroyed. According to the Red Cross, between 800 and 1,200 people died within 12 hours of Fifi&#x27;s landfall in Honduras. Buses driving through mountain passes skidded off the sides of cliffs due to slick roads, killing numerous people. Flash floods destroyed thousands of homes and isolated numerous towns. Waves, reaching in height, destroyed moorings and grounded numerous ships.

Continuous rain fell throughout September 19, resulting in widespread mudslides that killed over 2,000 people. A large mudslide blocked the Choloma River, preventing water from the river and the accumulated of rain caused by Fifi from reaching the ocean. The waters were released from this natural dam on September 20, when a concrete bridge broke upstream and tore through the mudslide. The torrent of water flowed down the valley, triggering a massive flood. The city of Choloma was decimated, with an estimated 2,800–5,000 people killed out of a population of 7,000. The flood occurred during the nighttime, so most residents were unaware of the impending catastrophe.
Other towns along the coast suffered similar fates as Choloma. In Armenta, roughly 400 families disappeared after a large landslide buried the town. However, the town is hardly known by people in the country and reports from the area were scarce. Another coastal town, Omoa (population of 2,500 to 3,000) was completely destroyed overnight on September 19. All of the residents were assumed to have perished; however, like Armenta, few people know of the town and estimates of the fatalities in it ranged from 30 to 3,000.

Although by this time the storm was situated inland over Mexico, its circulation continued to produce thunderstorms over Honduras, hindering rescue efforts. Nighttime rescues were prevented by dense fog blanketing most of the mountain valleys. The city of La Ceiba, population 53,000, was completely isolated from surrounding areas. Many were feared dead as newspapers reported bodies floating down rivers.

The death toll rose by the hundreds every day; at one point, the official death toll was estimated as high as 10,000. There is still uncertainty in the total number of fatalities due to Fifi. In general, however, most estimates range from 8,000 to 10,000. Overall this ranked Fifi as the second-deadliest Atlantic hurricane on record at the time. It was eventually lowered to third after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 wrought similar destruction in the same region, leaving between 11,000 and 18,000 dead.

Throughout the country, Fifi inflicted nearly $1.8 billion (1974 USD; $  USD) as part of what was, at the time, the worst natural disaster in Honduras&#x27; history. Due to the damage that Fifi caused, Fifi is the costliest Atlantic Hurricane to reach a maximum of Category 2. In certain coastal regions, only structures built on higher elevations were left standing. Many cities were more than 80% destroyed. Fifi demolished over 10,000 well-constructed homes throughout Honduras. An estimated 150,000 people were left homeless due to Fifi. However, the Honduran government estimated that between 350,000 and 500,000 were left homeless. The country&#x27;s banana crop was completely destroyed by the hurricane; as a result, its economy was severely affected.

===Elsewhere in Central America===

Officials in Belize and Guatemala rushed to complete emergency precautions for the approaching hurricane. Much of Central America north of Nicaragua was impacted by the hurricane. Rainfall reaching affected areas as far north as Campeche, Mexico. At Chinandega, Nicaragua, rainfall from the storm amounted to over a four-day period. The heavy precipitation led to significant flooding across the country as dozens of rivers exceeded their banks; hundreds were left homeless. The communities of La Conquista, Dulce Nombre, San Gregorio and San Vicente were isolated by flood waters after roads leading to them were washed away. In Chiquito, Izapa and Tamarindo, more than ten homes were destroyed and 50 people left homeless due to the storm. After the Río Coco overflowed its banks in Jinotega, 120 homes were destroyed, leaving 113 families homeless. Numerous other communities sustained similar damage throughout the country, especially near the Honduras border. Hundreds of people in the town of Wiwili clung to treetops and roofs along the Coco River.

Although the storm made landfall in Belize, the country suffered considerably less damage than in nearby Honduras. However, winds up to were recorded. The combination of winds and torrential rains damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in Belize. Waves along the coast reached above normal. Although torrential rains exceeding fell in nearby Honduras, only fell in the country. The country&#x27;s $800,000 banana crop was completely destroyed by the storm. Despite the severity of the damage, there were no reports of fatalities in Belize. In Guatemala, the weakened storm brought extreme rainfall that caused extensive flash flooding. Numerous bridges, roads and homes were washed away or destroyed. At least 200 people were killed, making Fifi the deadliest in the country in nearly 20 years. In El Salvador, the outer bands of Fifi produced flooding rains that killed at least ten people.

===Mexico and Arizona===
As Fifi tracked over Central America, the outer fringes of the storm produced of rainfall as far north as Campeche. Mexico sustained little or no damage from Hurricane Fifi. Once re-designated as Hurricane Orlene, however, the storm impacted the Pacific coast of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. There were no reports of casualties or major damage. In Acapulco, reports indicated that of rain fell within a six-hour span. Remnant moisture from the hurricane brought minor rainfall to portions of Arizona.

==Aftermath==

===Response and assistance===
In the wake of the storm, relief agencies and the Honduras government were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the disaster. Rescue planes flown throughout the country reported that hundreds of bodies were floating in rivers and water covered areas once occupied by towns. For the first three days, relief efforts were generally minimal due to the extremely poor state of the roads across Honduras. Numerous countries send tonnes of aid to the battered country, although it was initially stockpiled by the government until it could be properly distributed. By September 24, planes filled with relief supplies were being flown to Honduras from the United States, Cuba, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Venezuela. Relief crews, overwhelmed by the number of bodies, began taking desperate measures to prevent the spread of diseases. An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 bodies were burned by September 24.

Four helicopters supplied by the United States, from the Panama Canal, quickly began rescue missions. They airlifted survivors from flood waters and placed them on elevated land areas. The crew members reported that the people were desperate to get on the helicopters and during one mission, 34 people crowded on to one of the aircraft, which has a normal capacity of 15. Food packages dropped to survivors were fought over, some people reportedly fighting each other with machetes for the supplies. During several of the later rescue missions, people died from starvation and malnutrition on board the helicopters. From nearby Belize, Britain deployed 57 soldiers with motorboats to rush food to survivors in flooded regions. A group of 41 Cuban medical experts, including 21 doctors, treated nearly 900 in a period of two days.
By September 24, more than 350,000 people sought refuge in shelters set up throughout the country. Red Cross volunteers were overwhelmed by the number of families requesting help to find missing relatives. Relief planes sent by the United States were initially delayed by continued inclement weather. Several days after the storm&#x27;s passage, they were able to land in the country. These planes were loaded with food, clothes, water, medicine and other emergency supplies. Juan Bautista described the disaster wrought by Fifi as &quot;the worst moment in the nation&#x27;s 150-year history since independence.&quot;

Donation centers were set up throughout major cities in the United States by the Honduran Government. They planned to fill three planes and five or six ships with supplies that would be brought to the country. In Miami, Florida, governor Reubin Askew asked all residents to donate to the Red Cross or Salvation Army to help those affected by the hurricane. In St. Petersburg, Florida, a team of 14 doctors was sent to the country on October 9. Other doctors set up fund drives, one set for $50,000; however, officials in Honduras believed that this would be nowhere near the necessary funds for what would become a multibillion-dollar disaster. Numerous other nations and relief agencies joined in the effort to aid Honduras in what was considered one of the largest relief operations in history. Days after the storm, brigades, deployed by the Honduran military, began to reach the hardest-hit areas as floodwaters started to recede.

From Miami alone, 14 tons of relief goods were donated to Honduras. Roughly a month after the storm struck, the United States had donated roughly 1.8 million pounds (816,000 kg) of relief supplies. Government agencies also began working on plans to revive the broken economy. An initial plan costing $5 million to restart the agricultural business was set up and another $15 million was set to be given out as a two-year loan. One group of people from a Baptist church in Texas spent $30,000 on a custom-designed food wagon to distribute food to the people of El Progreso. In some areas, residents did not know how to use certain supplies, such as toilet paper and tea bags, due to their culture and isolation from urban areas. &quot;...a British helicopter team dropped toilet paper and tea bags to the people of El Progreso, who are unfamiliar with both items. Using the toilet paper as wrappers, the villagers smoked the tea.&quot;

In Honduras, the Red Cross and other relief agencies quickly attempted to unload planes to assure that supplies would reach victims. However, some of the supplies were hoarded by the Honduran military as they quickly went to unload the planes. One of the incidents took place after a plane carrying supplies from Argentina landed and the military forced the volunteer members away from the plane. Once in the hands of the military, the fate of the supplies was unknown. As the full amount of supplies did not reach victims, reports of people starving to death surfaced. Eventually, relief crews found these reports to be true as they distributed food to those who survived.

Following the storm, the country&#x27;s economy suffered for two years. During this time, the annual deficit reached $200 million, against the annual income of $153 million.

===Rebuilding===
In 1977, a large-scale reconstruction project involving six villages across Honduras began. The first of the six project areas contained 121 homes with an average of 25 square meters of space. It was located along an important highway in northern Honduras; however, the rebuilding was initially delayed by erosion issues. The second plan consisted of 127 homes roughly a mile south of the first. The third, consisting of 26 concrete homes, was placed in the city of El Progreso. This project was determined to house the most people per home, roughly seven occupants for a preliminary total of 182 people. The fourth was the most isolated of the six planned constructions. In a rural area far outside urban regions, 92 homes were planned to be constructed. The fifth project, consisting of 33 homes, was placed close to the first project, having a similar access to the major highway. The final housing project, and largest, was set up south of the destroyed town of Choloma. A total of 600 homes, all built on concrete blocks and doubled up, were placed in this housing project.

On October 3, 1974, Guatemalan businessmen Dionisio Gutiérrez and Alfonso Bosch died when they went by plane to support the victims of Hurricane Fifi–Orlene in Honduras. The plane was carrying a shipment of medicines that had been collected by the Rotary Club of Guatemala but was crashed by weather conditions and cargo near the village of Las Nubes. The descendants of the deceased, owners of companies such as Pollo Campero, Avícola Villalobos and Empacadora Toledo created the Juan Bautista Gutierrez Foundation to centralize a series of social projects that they had carried out for several years.

===Retirement===

On account of the severe damage and high death toll from the hurricane in the Atlantic basin, the name &quot;Fifi&quot; was retired at the end of the 1974 season. It will never again be used to name a tropical storm in the basin.

<doc id="987097" wikidata="Q16180" url="?curid=987097" title="Province of Forlì-Cesena">
<text>The Province of Forlì-Cesena () is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its capitals are the cities of Forlì and Cesena. The province has a population of 394,273 as of 2016 over an area of . It contains 30 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) and the provincial president is Davide Drei. Although located close to the independent Republic of San Marino, Forlì-Cesena does not share a land border with the sovereign state.

==History==
Forlì was founded by the Roman consul Marcus Livius Salinator, and it was connected to the Via Aemilia in 188 BCE. By the 12th century CE, it had become a Ghibelline commune and military garrison. The Holy See initiated a small attempt to rule Forlì in 1278, but the family of Ordelaffi led the city from 1315 until 1480. The city was later governed by Girolamo Riario and his wife, Caterina Sforza; during this period, the Holy See attempted to regain control but was unsuccessful. Spanish Pope Alexander VI ordered his son Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois, to Forlì and other communes in the region; Borgia successfully gained control of Forlì in 1500, but lost it in 1503, after the death of Alexander VI. Until the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, it remained under the rule of the Holy See.

Cesena was first owned by the Romans until the fall of Rome when it was taken by the Byzantine Empire. Following this, it was owned by archbishops of Ravenna. During the period of issues between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Holy See took over Cesena from the Ordelaffis. Antipope Clement VII&#x27;s troops almost completely destroyed Cesena in 1377, and the Pope gave the city to the House of Malatesta. After the House of Malatesta controlled the city from 1378 to 1465, the Holy See regained control of Cesena. Leonardo da Vinci designed the port Cesenatico. It remained under papal rule until Italy was unified.

In 1921, there was a rapid advance of the Fascist movement in the region triggered by issues connected with agrarian reform. Buildings belonging to the republicans and socialists were seized or burnt down by Italo Balbo, and on July 29, he and his men moved throughout the provinces of Ravenna and Forlì, burning every socialist organisation headquarters in a night of terror which was later called the &quot;column of fire&quot;. This was a pivotal moment in the advance of Fascism in northern Italy.

On 16 April 1992, the Province of Rimini was formed from the Province of Forlì&#x27;s southwestern municipalities. The remaining part of the Province of Forlì was renamed the Province of Forlì-Cesena.

==Geography==
The province of Forlì-Cesena is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. Along with that of Rimini, it is the most southerly of the provinces in the region and it abuts onto the Adriatic Sea for a short distance. The province of Ravenna lies to the north. To the west lies the Metropolitan City of Florence and, further south, the province of Arezzo, both in the region of Tuscany. In the southeast the province borders on the province of Rimini. The role of the provincial capital is shared by the two cities of Cesena and Forlì, the latter of which is situated on the bank of the Montone river about southeast of Bologna.

<doc id="987101" wikidata="Q2618972" url="?curid=987101" title="Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients">
<text>The landscape for instant messaging involves cross-platform instant messaging clients that can handle one or multiple protocols. Clients that use the same protocol can typically federate and talk to one another. The following table compares general and technical information for cross-platform instant messaging clients in active development, each of which have their own article that provide further information. 

== General ==

== Operating system support ==

==Connectivity==

==Privacy==
Some messaging services that are not designed for privacy require a unique phone number for sign-up, as a form of identity verification and to prevent users from creating multiple accounts.

Some messaging services that do not solely focus on a mobile-first experience, or enforce SMS authentication, may allow email addresses to be used for sign-up instead.

Some messaging services offer greater flexibility and privacy, by allowing users to create more than one account to compartmentalize personal &amp; work purposes, or not requiring personally identifiable information for sign-up.

To find out if the software has end-to-end encryption, see &quot;media&quot; table below.

* 1: Apple iOS doesn&#x27;t allow screenshot protection.

===Screenshot security===


==Message handling==

==Media==

== Backup and restore messages ==
Official status to guarantee support for backing up and restoring messages.


==Miscellaneous==
Messaging services can operate around different models, based on security and accessibility considerations.

A mobile-focused, phone number-based model operates on the concept of primary and secondary devices. Examples of such messaging services include: WhatsApp, Viber, Line, WeChat, Signal, etc. The primary device is a mobile phone and is required to login and send/receive messages. Only one mobile phone is allowed to be the primary device, as attempting to login to the messaging app on another mobile phone would trigger the previous phone to be logged out. The secondary device is a computer running a desktop operating system, which serves as a companion for the primary device. Desktop messaging clients on secondary devices do not function independently, as they are reliant on the mobile phone maintaining an active network connection for login authentication and syncing messages.

A multi-device, device-agnostic model is designed for accessibility on multiple devices, regardless of desktop or mobile. Examples of such messaging services include: Skype, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts (subsequently Google Chat), Telegram, ICQ, Element, Slack, Discord, etc. Users have more options as usernames or email addresses can be used as user identifiers, besides phone numbers. Unlike the phone-based model, user accounts on a multi-device model are not tied to a single device, and logins are allowed on multiple devices. Messaging services with a multi-device model are able to eliminate feature disparity and provide identical functionality on both mobile and desktop clients. Desktop clients can function independently, without relying on the mobile phone to login and sync messages.

<text>The non-existent Buenaventura River, alternatively San Buenaventura River or Río Buenaventura, was once believed to run from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean through the Great Basin region of what is now the western United States. The river was chronologically the last of several imagined incarnations of an imagined Great River of the West which would be for North America west of the Rockies what the Mississippi River was east of the Rockies. The hopes were to find a waterway from coast to coast, sparing the traveling around Cape Horn at the tip of South America.

==Domínguez, Vélez de Escalante and Miera==
In 1776, two Franciscan missionaries Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante sought to find a land route between Santa Fe in Nuevo México to Monterey in Alta California. They were part of what has become known as the Domínguez–Escalante expedition, a ten-man expedition including Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco (Miera) acting as the cartographer. On September 13, they encountered what is now called the Green River in modern day Utah, a southward-flowing tributary of the Colorado and named it &quot;San Buenaventura&quot; after the catholic saint Bonaventure.

At that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante&#x27;s journal correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today&#x27;s White River? – which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south. So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name.

After establishing contact with a branch of the Ute (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called Lake Timpanogos (various spellings), now called &quot;Utah Lake,&quot; the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the Sevier River) flowing from the south-southeast, and turned toward the west at the point where they encountered it. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream--the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake (Sevier Lake) and beyond. The Sevier Lake has no outlet, so the indigenes may have been referring to the west-flowing Humboldt River, which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers.

Despite Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante&#x27;s doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depict the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake in west-central Utah. In an accompanying note to king Charles III of Spain, Miera recommended building several missions in the area and mentioned the possibility of a water way to the Pacific Ocean, via the Buenaventura or the Timpanogos River: the river Miera depicts on his map as flowing west from the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Although Miera documented a correct description of the GSL given to them by the indigenes the Spanish assumed that what they thought had been described was incorrect and interpreted their description of the &quot;extremely salty&quot; lake as the ocean and assumed that the description of the river flowing from &quot;Lake Timpanogos&quot;, which is the Jordan River flowing between Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, was of a waterway to the Pacific.

The error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as Alexander von Humboldt, who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalanté expedition to prepare his maps in 1804 and 1809. Zebulon Pike used Humboldt&#x27;s maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810. Aaron Arrowsmith in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to &quot;Lac Sale&quot;. These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante.

==Timpanogos and Los Mongos rivers==

Beginning in 1819, maps began showing two rivers that arose from the Great Salt Lake and Sevier Lake. The northerly one was that which connected Miera&#x27;s outlet from the Great Salt Lake to the Sacramento River and was referred to as the &quot;Timpanogos River&quot;. In 1822, Henry Tanner posited another outlet from the Great Salt Lake, the &quot;Los Mongos&quot; River that was the source of the Rogue River (Oregon). In 1825, Jedediah Smith, explored areas the north of the GSL, but did not find the Los Mongos. He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were unsuccessful in finding &quot;R. Timpanogos&quot;. However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the &quot;R. Timpanogos&quot; as &quot;R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos&quot;. So, when, in 1841, John Bidwell embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific.

==Extending the Buenaventura West to the Pacific==
There had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage. When Francisco Garcés drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the Sierra Nevada, and he drew the &quot;San Felipe&quot; or San Joaquin River originating beyond the Sierras in the Great Basin and flowing to the Pacific Ocean, in or near San Francisco Bay. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole Viceroyalty of New Spain (1784), they extended the &quot;San Felipe&quot; almost to the Sevier Lake. A similar map was published in 1820 by Sidney E. Morse showing the Rio de San Buenaventura flowing into a lake, the western limits of which are unknown. This map shows the &quot;Supposed river between the Buenaventura and the Bay of Francisco, which will probably be the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific&quot; toward this lake, but quite not connecting with it. A map by J. Finlayson (1822) shows a Rio de S. Buenaventura originating near the &quot; source of the Rio Colorado&quot; and emptying into a salt lake the western limits of which &quot;are unknown&quot;. This same map indicates that an uncharted Rio de San Filipe crosses a range of mountains at 122 degrees west longitude.

Other cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and &quot;Lac Salado&quot; to the Pacific Ocean. Henry S. Tanner&#x27;s influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay. This map also shows two rivers flowing from Lake Timpanogos, (Utah Lake) one to San Francisco Bay (the R. Timpanogos), the other to Port Orford, Oregon (the Los Mongos R.) where the Rogue River enters the Pacific. A similar map by Anthony Finley was published in 1826 A map by Thomas Bradford (1835) shows a river flowing to San Francisco Bay (labeled as &quot;Port Sir Francis Drake&quot; in a region Bradford called &quot;New Albion&quot;) from the south end of Lake Timpanogos. There is no reference to Rio de San Buenaventura. An 1844 map by James Bowden shows a landlocked Buenaventura wrapping around the southeast side of a &quot;doubtful&quot; Lake Timpanogos.

==Explorations to find the Buenaventura==
The Great Salt Lake (GSL) was first seen and reported as very saline by white North Americans in 1824, apparently independently by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Upon learning of the GSL, explorers began equating Lake Timpanogos on the maps with it and, apparently unaware of the fact that saline lakes such as the Great Salt and Sevier Lakes have no outlets, began efforts to find the rivers flowing from them west to the Pacific as promised by maps such as Tanner&#x27;s.

In 1825, William H. Ashley attempted to float the Green (Buenaventura) River to either what was called &quot;Salt Lake&quot; (actually Sevier Lake) on Tanner&#x27;s map, or the Colorado River, to which the fur traders suspected it flowed. He started in present-day Wyoming, and after passing through the treacherous Gates of Lodore, aborted the trip prior to entering Desolation Canyon. Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL. 

After Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura. In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake. Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further. He encountered the Sevier River on its northeast-flowing stretch, and assuming it continued to flow north to Utah Lake, dismissed it as the possible Buenaventura and continued southwest to Southern California. In 1827 and 1828 he tracked the western flank of the Sierra Nevada in its full length, without registering a river that passed through the range, but he heard the Sacramento River referenced as the &quot;Buenaventura&quot; by Luis Antonio Argüello. A map by Albert Gallatin (1836), based on information from Smith&#x27;s travels, labels the Sacramento River as the Buenaventura and equated Lake Timpanogos with the GSL, but did not try to connect the two.

In the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer. He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet. He instead followed the entire course of the river upstream to its head. 

The Buenaventura River&#x27;s existence or non-existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when John Charles Frémont, with Thomas Fitzpatrick and Kit Carson as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the Columbia River to Sacramento, California via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at Walker River, he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist. Upon later finding the Salinas River flowed into the Pacific at about the same point the maps depicted the mouth of the Buenaventura, Frémont concluded that it was the source of the legend and applied the name &quot;Rio San Buenaventura&quot; to it.

After Frémont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, President Polk was reluctant to accept his conclusion. However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Frémont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, directed their ambitions to a transcontinental railway, which was completed in 1869, after the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the American Civil War.

<doc id="987110" wikidata="Q16228" url="?curid=987110" title="Province of Parma">
<text>The province of Parma () is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its largest town and capital is the city of Parma.

It is made up of 47 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;). It has an area of and a total population of around 450,000.

The province is bordered by the province of Reggio Emilia to the east, the Piacenza to the west, Lombardy&#x27;s provinces of Cremona and Mantua to the north and by Liguria&#x27;s provinces of La Spezia and Genoa and Tuscany&#x27;s Province of Massa-Carrara to the south.

== History ==
In 1861, Italian provinces were established on the French republican model.

Italian Fascism saw the end of elections in the province of Parma in the 1920s until the end of the Second World War.

==Geography==

The province is divided into three zones from north to south: the &quot;pianura&quot; (plains), the &quot;collina&quot; (hills) and the &quot;montagna&quot; (mountains). The Po river acts as a boundary with the nearby province of Cremona in the plains. The main centres of the &quot;collina&quot; and &quot;montagna&quot; are situated along the course of the main rivers, which descend from the Parmesan Apennine Mountains. Roughly, each zone comprises one third of the total area.

=== The plains ===
The part in the North of the Province comprises Parma, Fidenza and various smaller towns, and covers from the Po river to the foothills at an altitude of 50 to 100 m amsl. This area has a continental climate, with cold winters (minimum temperatures around −1 °C in the city centres, −3 °C to −4° in the countryside on average) with an average of 45 to 60 cm of snow each year, hot and humid summers (maximum temperatures over 30 °C on average). During autumns and springs it is not uncommon to encounter fog, with an average of 31 days of fog a year in the city of Parma and higher values on the countryside, particularly in the area close to the Po river. During summer, thunderstorms with heavy rain and hail can hit the area. This is the part of the Province that hosts the vast majority of the industrial production, while the rest of the land is extensively used to grow crops, mainly wheat, tomatoes (with Mutti and various other producers based here) and alfalfa to feed the cows whose milk is used to produce Parmesan cheese.

=== The hills ===
The centre part of the Province comprises only smaller towns, built in the valleys along rivers or on top of hills for defensive purposes, from the foothills to where the Apennine begin to grow into fully developed mountains, between 100 and around 700 m amsl. Many of those towns are built around medieval castles, such as Bardi, Torrechiara, Compiano and many others. In this area the climate is slightly different from that of the plains, with less foggy days, milder temperatures (higher minimum temperatures during winter and lower maximum temperatures during summer due to its height that makes it less prone to Temperature inversions. Here, cultivated fields and wide woods coexist, mainly because part of the land is owned by families no longer living in the area, as big chunks of the population migrated to the plains or to other nations, mainly the United States, the United Kingdom and Argentina, over the course of the 20th century.

=== The mountains ===
The southernmost area of the Province is occupied by the ridge of the Apennine, with mountains ranging from 1000 m to the 1850 m amsl of Mount Sillara, Mount Losanna and Mount Marmagna. Due to the geographical nature of this mountain range, the Parmesan side, facing North, has considerably longer nights than the rest of Pianura padana and the Italian Alps, even during summer. In this area the climate is Alpine, with long winters, temperatures frequently reaching double digits negatives and snow falling from October to May, typically leaving the tops snow-free only from mid June to the end of September. During the summer months temperatures reach the lower 20s°C only when intense heat waves hit the region, while minimum temperatures are in the 5–8 °C range, depending on the altitude. Almost daily thunderstorms develop on these mountains during summer, rarely being snow thunderstorms. The mountains are almost completely covered in forests to a height of about 1500 m amsl, where grass, heather and various berries predominate. Two main towns are located in the valleys between the Apennine mountains: Bedonia and Borgotaro, historically in control of commercial traffic through the passes to Liguria (Passo del Tomarlo, Passo della Cisa, Passo del Brattello, Passo del Bocco and others).

==&quot;Comuni&quot;==

The province of Parma comprises 47 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;). The 20 largest of these are:

==Cuisine==
Parma is famous for its &quot;prosciutto di Parma&quot;. The whole area is renowned for its salami production (particularly the well known &quot;salame Felino&quot;), as well as for the Parmesan cheese and some kinds of pasta like &quot;gnocchi di patate&quot;, &quot;cappelletti&quot; (or &quot;anolini&quot;) in &quot;brodo&quot; (a kind of round &quot;tortelli&quot; stuffed with a filling made of stewed donkey, Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, cooked and served in hot broth), &quot;tortelli&quot; with different stuffing (&quot;erbetta&quot;, potatoes, pumpkin, mushrooms, chestnuts, &quot;tortél dóls di Colorno&quot;) and &quot;chicche&quot;.

==Transport==
===Highways===
There are two main highways that go through Parma: A1, to Milan to the west and to Bologna to the east, and A15, to La Spezia and the sea to the south.

===Airport===
The Province of Parma is served by the Giuseppe Verdi Airport.

===Railways===
The province is crossed by the Milan-Bologna railroad, one of the most important in Italy, with a station in Parma. The latter is the starting point for the following lines, connecting the city to the Tyrrhenian Sea, Alps and the Po River delta:

* Pontremolese line, with a branch to Fidenza and Fornovo di Taro
* Parma-Piadena-Brescia
* Parma-Suzzara (held by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna Srl.

The station of Fidenza is an exchange point for the lines:

* Fidenza-Salsomaggiore Terme
* Fidenza-Cremona

==Sport==
Parma FC was founded in 1913. It is a Serie B football club renowned in Italy and Europe for its successes including three national cups, a European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup, two UEFA Cups, a European Supercup and an Italian Supercup. It plays in the city&#x27;s stade Ennio Tardini which used to host up to 29,000 spectators but is being renovated in 2008 after the club was demoted to Serie B. In spring 2009 the team was promoted again in the top league (Serie A). Crociati Noceto play in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, the fourth tier.

Parma is also home to two rugby union teams in the top national division, Overmach Rugby Parma and SKG Gran Rugby.

Parma Panthers is the Parma American football team for which John Grisham&#x27;s book &quot;Playing for Pizza&quot; was based.

Also volleyball, women&#x27;s basketball and baseball have large popularity in the city and have scored relevant successes.

<text>Hurricane Eloise was the most destructive tropical cyclone of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the Virgin Islands. The depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of Puerto Rico. Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter, but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making landfall over Hispaniola. A weak and disorganized cyclone, Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea; upon striking the northern Yucatan Peninsula, it turned north and began to re-intensify. In the Gulf of Mexico, the cyclone quickly matured and became a Category 3 hurricane on September 23. Eloise made landfall along the Florida Panhandle west of Panama City before moving inland across Alabama and dissipating on September 24.

The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths. Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities. As Eloise progressed westward, it affected Cuba to a lesser extent. In advance of the storm, about 100,000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region. Upon making landfall in Florida, Eloise generated wind gusts of 155 miles per hour (249 km/h), which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area. The storm&#x27;s severe winds, waves, and storm surge left numerous beaches, piers, and other coastal structures heavily impaired.

Wind-related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia. Further north, torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far-reaching flooding event, especially into the Mid-Atlantic States. In that region, an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post-tropical storm; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes several years prior. Across the United States, damage amounted to approximately $560 million. The storm killed 80 people along its entire track; due to the severe damage, the name &quot;Eloise&quot; was retired from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists.

==Meteorological history==

The origins of Hurricane Eloise trace back to a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on September 6, 1975. Satellite imagery indicated that the system was initially disjointed and poorly developed, although there was evidence of a low-level circulation. The disturbance tracked westward for several days as it slowly matured. On September 13, a ship called the &quot;Gulf Hansa&quot; recorded winds of around and seas in association with the system. Shortly thereafter, a reconnaissance aircraft found a center of circulation east of the Virgin Islands, and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC.

The depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened. On September 16, the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise; accordingly, the first advisory on the system was issued by the San Juan Weather Bureau office. While in the vicinity of a strengthening anticyclone aloft, Eloise became better organized, and the storm rapidly intensified and reached Category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named. The cyclone soon made landfall on the Dominican Republic, inhibiting further development. Although initially predicted to remain north of land, the storm moved across northern Hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern Cuba. After 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain, Eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 17.

The cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern Caribbean on September 19, passing Jamaica to the north as it moved away from Cuba. Despite favorable upper-level conditions, its interaction with land—combined with the weakening of a ridge to the north—left the storm&#x27;s center distorted. Eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until September 20, when it approached the Yucatan Peninsula and began to re-intensify. The storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching trough. Between September 17 and September 21, however, reports on the storm were scarce, leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, Eloise quickly organized. The trough enhanced the wind divergence over the storm&#x27;s center, allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about south of New Orleans, Louisiana.
On September 22, the cyclone intensified to attain Category 2 strength, and became a major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast. Several ships penetrated the storm&#x27;s center during its passage through the gulf. The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm, aiding meteorologists in their forecasts. Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg). It moved ashore along the Florida Panhandle near Panama City on September 23. Shortly after making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. Just six hours later, it had weakened into a tropical storm, while situated over eastern Alabama. It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24. The depression transitioned into an extratropical storm over Virginia, and became indistinguishable by later that same day. The remnant moisture, however, merged with a weather front to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.

==Preparations==
In advance of Hurricane Eloise, warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. A hurricane warning was declared for parts of the Dominican Republic about 12 hours before landfall. A &quot;hurricane emergency&quot; was put into effect for the Oriente Province of Cuba, while a &quot;state of alert&quot; was issued for the Camagüey Province. Cubana de Aviación suspended all flights to Oriente.

On and before September 15, there was still uncertainty as to whether Eloise would impact the United States. However, officials in Florida began taking precautionary measures. When the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near Mobile Bay. Contrary to predictions, by late on September 22, the storm had turned northeast, and some residents of Florida were still unaware of the storm&#x27;s threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance. As a result, evacuations were delayed to an extent. During the morning hours of September 23, civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter. Due to the intensity of the approaching hurricane, evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough, despite the initial delay. It was reported that 99% of Pensacola residents along the beach had left their homes, and overall, 100,000 people evacuated from areas in Louisiana through Florida.

A statement issued by the National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.

==Impact==
===Caribbean Sea===

As a weak tropical depression, the storm brought of rainfall to portions of the Leeward Islands, including St. Kitts and St. Martin. More minor amounts of precipitation fell over the northernmost islands, and winds were light in these areas.

Despite being only a tropical storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at in Dos Bocas. Other totals of were common. The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages. Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though Utuado, with a population of 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a &quot;total disaster&quot;; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away. The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out-of-service.

As the storm proceeded westward, it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern Hispaniola. Widespread flooding impacted Haiti and the Dominican Republic, leaving a total of 25 people dead. Although the most intense winds remained offshore, a gust of was recorded at Cape Engaño. Puerto Plata on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain. Following the storm, electricity was turned off due to the danger of electrocutions. Despite the storm&#x27;s effects across Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, no monetary damage totals are available.

Rain and wind from the storm affected the southern Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and the northern Yucatan Peninsula. Since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas, no significant damage was reported. Eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in southeastern Cuba, inflicting $65,000 in damage. Personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm.

===Florida===
Eloise came ashore along the coast of northern Florida as a Category 3 storm producing winds of with gusts that reached 155 mph (249 km/h). Sustained winds were likely higher, but due to the sparsity of recording stations, few official records exist. The winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century. Hurricane-force winds occurred from Fort Walton Beach through Panama City. Along the coast, tides ran above normal, peaking at . Hurricane Eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland. In general, rainfall ranged from ; at the Eglin Air Force Base near Valparaiso, however, the hurricane dropped of precipitation. The heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storm&#x27;s track, and a number of locations to the east of Eloise&#x27;s center picked up less than of rain.

Damage from the hurricane was widespread. Fort Walton Beach, where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, was hit particularly hard. In some areas, the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds. The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand. Throughout northwest Florida, an estimated 8,000 people suffered storm-related losses, and 500 businesses were completely destroyed. An article in the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; reported that &quot;Cottages, motels, restaurants, convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles, lines and busted mains.&quot; A shrimp farm at Panama City, the first of its kind, was effectively lost. The storm destroyed the farm&#x27;s prospective initial harvest, of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures. The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover, followed by a quick and steady rebound. By the spring of 1976, the company became confident in financial success and full recovery.
The storm caused severe beach erosion in Bay County; approximately of sand was removed. Storm-related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the Panama City Beach area. The most severe damage was concentrated in a area of the shore east of the hurricane&#x27;s eye, and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates. Much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining, which was compared to that of the New England hurricane of 1938. Although Eloise was not abnormally strong, the geography setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses. Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $50 million.

The first major storm to strike the region in 40 years, Hurricane Eloise did not directly kill anyone in the state of Florida. However, four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane; two of them were related to heart attacks. Numerous people sustained injuries, largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts. Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $150 million. In the storm&#x27;s aftermath, a study of the hurricane&#x27;s effect on aquatic animals living in the &quot;swash zone&quot; (the immediate area where land and the ocean meet) of Panama City Beach was conducted. The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm, the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore. However, the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter. Also along the shore, the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers, including the total destruction of a extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span. A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage, along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B. Miller Pier at Panama City Beach, which lost its end section to the storm.

===Elsewhere in the United States===
As the hurricane progressed inland, it passed over eastern Alabama, generating strong winds. A gust of was recorded northeast of Ozark. Winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around to . Precipitation in Alabama peaked at . The high winds resulted in severe damage to property and crops, amounting to $100 million. Eloise cut power and telephone service in the area, and in Geneva County, several people sustained storm-related injuries. As in Florida, the weakening hurricane spawned a number of tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia. Preliminary reports indicated that every county in southeastern Alabama received some damage from the storm. The strong winds uprooted trees and knocked down powerlines. Heavy rain associated with the storm caused a leak in the Alabama State Capitol building roof. Gusty winds, moderate to heavy rainfall, and low pressures extended into Georgia, Louisiana, and to a lesser extent, Mississippi.
The remnants of Eloise interacted with another weather system, producing widespread precipitation across the Eastern United States, including portions of the Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic states, and New England. The deluge was &quot;almost continuous&quot; during the period between September 22 and 26 according to a statement by the National Weather Service. One of the highest rainfall totals in association with the storm occurred in Westminster, Maryland, where of rain were recorded. Elsewhere, or more of precipitation fell throughout parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. At least 22 states received rainfall from Hurricane Eloise and its remnant moisture. Nearby Hurricane Faye may have also contributed to the heavy rainfall, although this connection was never confirmed. In Washington, D.C., of rain contributed to the wettest September on record since 1934. The excessive rainfall led to extensive flooding throughout the region, in some areas exceeding 50- to 100-year levels.

Pennsylvania and New York bore the brunt of the flooding, which culminated in loss of life and severe property damage. Along the central Southern Tier region of New York, the storm damaged or destroyed over 700 structures. Flooding throughout the Northeastern United States disabled over a dozen water plants and at least 16 sewage treatment plants, prompting a boil-water advisory in Pennsylvania&#x27;s capital city of Harrisburg. Infrastructure further south also suffered; in Maryland, the Monocacy River—a tributary of the Potomac—swelled to above flood stage, inundating the city of Frederick and compromising the city&#x27;s supply of fresh drinking water. A final downpour of rain on the night of September 25–26 led to an additional of rain in central Maryland triggered severe flash flooding. In some cases, this onslaught affected the same areas that were still recovering from Hurricane Agnes several years earlier, including Ellicott City, Elkridge, and Laurel, where two major rivers breached their banks and engulfed nearby areas. Many homes and businesses were lost, along with numerous vehicles; in the aftermath, looters entered on boats to access the devastated cities. The floodgates at the Rocky Gorge Dam in Laurel were opened, forcing 500 residents downstream to leave their homes.

The consequences of the flooding rains were the worst seen in areas of the interior Mid-Atlantic states since Agnes, and comparisons were often drawn between the two hurricanes. In Pennsylvania alone, flooding from the remnants of Eloise forced 20,000 residents out of their homes; thousands further south in the Washington, D.C. area, where severe flooding impacted the city&#x27;s southern suburbs, also fled to seek refuge. Further, many motorists throughout the region became stranded on highways inundated by floodwaters. Four Mile Run and nearby streams overflowed and &quot;tumbled through residential neighborhoods&quot;. Hundreds of families in the Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia area suffered flood-related losses. Across the Northeastern U.S., the storm system killed 17 people and inflicted $300 million in damage. An instance of a storm-induced fatality is the death of a man in White Plains, New York, who was killed by waters raging across the Hutchinson River Parkway. Agriculturally, the extended period of wet weather threatened a range of crops, including the Rhode Island apple crop, of which 35% was feared to have been destroyed, and corn and sweet potato fields in North Carolina. With ground too moist for farm machinery to operate on, harvests were postponed.

==Aftermath==
After touring the disaster area, Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted, &quot;I think we&#x27;re going to have to take a long, close look at some of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won&#x27;t be able to be built back in the exact location where they were.&quot; Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data.

On September 26, President Gerald Ford approved the declaration for Florida, and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm&#x27;s flooding rains progressed northward. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm-ravaged areas. Over $430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92,000 families; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course. In Maryland, Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state&#x27;s 23 counties under a state of emergency. 

On account of the severe damage caused by the hurricane, the name &quot;Eloise&quot; was retired at the end of the 1975 season. It will never again be used to name a tropical storm in the Atlantic basin.

<text>The music of Suriname is known for kaseko music, and for having an Indo-Caribbean tradition.

==Kawina==

Kawina originated around the 1860s, after the abolition of slavery. The vocals are typically call-and-response, and it is accompanied by all kinds of typical Surinamese percussion, such as the skratji.

Like many South American music genres, the rhythm of the &quot;kawina&quot; originates in Africa. African slaves took their religions, such as Winti, and music with them to Suriname. To dissipate the time, the slaves sung during the work on the plantations, often in a typical pattern of one voice that asks for, and is answered in unison (&quot;call-and-response&quot;). The music was performed so rhythmically that it became a dance. In the beginning, the lyrics were religious.

After abolition of slavery, it became entertainment music, with lyrics that are more socially critical in tone. From then on, &quot;kawina&quot; is performed by orchestras containing about ten band members, on various Surinamese percussion instruments. Typical instruments are the double-skinned drums, the &quot;zigzag&quot; or shaker and the &quot;kwa-kwa bangi&quot; (idiophone). The vocals have always remained in the call-and-response pattern. If a drum kit forms part of the occupation, it is called &quot;kaskawi&quot; - a subgenre that arises in the 1970s. In the following years, kawina also mixed with other musical genres such as kaseko and rhythm and blues.

==Kaseko==

The term &quot;Kaseko&quot; is probably derived from the French expression &quot;casser le corps&quot; (&quot;break the body&quot;), which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance. Kaseko is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles derived from Africa, Europe and the Americas. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum) and snare drums, as well as saxophone, trumpet and occasionally trombone. Singing can be both solo and choir. Songs are typically call-and-response, as are Creole folk styles from the area, such as kawina.

Kaseko emerged from the traditional Afro-Surinamese kawina music, which was played since the beginning of 1900 by street musicians in Paramaribo. It evolved in the 1930s during festivities that used large bands, especially brass bands, and was called Bigi Poku (&quot;big drum music&quot;). In the late 1940s, jazz, calypso and other importations became popular, while rock and roll from the United States soon left its own influence in the form of electrified instruments.

==Maroon music==

Surinamese Maroons escaped slavery prior to its abolition in 1863, hiding in the dense jungles of the area, and formed communities like the Aluku, Saramaka, Ndjuka, Matawai, Kwinti and Bakabusi Nengre. Their traditional sung stories are called &quot;mato&quot;, and there are also popular Maroon musics called aleke and seketi. Traditional dances include &quot;awasa&quot;, a women&#x27;s social dance.

==Javanese-Surinamese music==
Gamelan music

Gamelan music is the well-known Javanese traditional music in Suriname. This type of music is commonly used to accompany dances, songs and scenes. The Gamelan music is originally from Indonesia and it is common in Javanese cultural activities. A Gamelan orchestra generally consists mainly of metallic xylophones, gongs of several sizes and a drum. There are different types of Gamelan orchestras. The most recent development in Suriname&#x27;s Gamelan music is the inclusion of western musical instrument in a Gamelan orchestra.

Pop Jawa

In modern Javanese music, Pop Jawa has become very mainstream. Pop Jawa consists of western instruments mixed with Javanese vocals.

==Hindi-Surinamese music/Baithak Gana==
Indian music arrived with immigrants from South Asia. This originally included folk music played with dhantal, tabla, sitar, harmonium and dholak, later including tassa drums. Music was mostly Hindu songs called bhajans, as well as filmi. The tan singing style is unique to the Indian community in Suriname and Guyana.

Alioko is also a very popular form of religious music that developed through different cultures and made its way to Suriname. Using drums and forms of guitars they communicate with the spirits and gods through this ( al- ee- ock - oh ) music.

Recorded Indian music in Suriname began with the release of &quot;King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe&quot; by Ramdew Chaitoe, in 1958. Chaitoe became very popular, and his music, which was religious in nature, left a lasting influence on future performers. However, no one very successful arose following Chaitoe, until 1968, when Dropati released &quot;Let&#x27;s Sing and Dance&quot;, an album of folk and religious songs that remains extremely popular.

In 1958, East Indian music finally made its debut on the recording industry with the release of an album of devotional songs, by Ramdew Chaitoe of Suriname. His album titled, &quot;King of Suriname&quot; and &quot;The Star Melodies of Ramdew Chaitoe&quot; was quite appropriately named, as it made him a household name with East Indians not just in Suriname, but throughout the Caribbean. Although his songs were religious in nature, the use of the strong beats of the dhantal and dholak, coupled with his own creolised version of Hindi often had many listeners dancing as if it were a pop song. In fact, one song, &quot;Raat Ke Sapna,&quot; would go on to become a huge dance hit in the decades to follow.

Although the release of King of Suriname presented a breakthrough for East Indian music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe in the years to follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult East Indian music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing &amp; Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati&#x27;s songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the East Indian community. Dropati&#x27;s epic songs such as &quot;Gowri Pooja&quot; and &quot;Lawa&quot; became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing &amp; Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling East Indian albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of the release of these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove East Indian music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the East Indians of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non-religious form of East Indian music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal &amp; tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing &amp; Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular.

Hindustani Classical music in Suriname

With the help of Government of India, the &quot;Indiaase cultureel Centrum&quot; was established under Embassy of India in Paramaribo. Many teachers visited on deputation and promoted Hindustani classical Music. Prof. Kinot, Ms. Sujata, Ut. Md. Sayeed Khan, Mr. Ardhendu Shekhar, Mrs. Rita Bokil and a few more teachers came. Prof. Rajesh Kelkar (from historic Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda), while working with the Cultural centre, expanded teaching of music to Nickerie (247 km from capital) and other places with missionary zeal. His efforts took Indian music into interior villages of Suriname. His services were longest in Suriname.

<text>The province of Piacenza () is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its provincial capital is the city Piacenza. As of 2016, it has a total population of 286,572 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 111.38 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city Piacenza has a population of 102,269, as of 2015. The provincial president is Patrizia Barbieri and it contains 48 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;). The province dates back to its founding by the Romans in 218 BCE.

==History==
Piacenza was founded by the Romans for military purposes in 218 BCE. It was conquered by Carthaginian Hasdrubal II in 207 BCE and the city was sacked in 200 BCE by the Gauls. A key city in the region, it was destroyed by barbarians but the town was rebuilt under the rule of bishops in the 10th century. By the 12th century, the city was a free &quot;comune&quot; and it later fought against Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor as part of the Lombard League. In the Renaissance period it passed from French, to papal, to Viscontis, to Sforzas rule. Pope Paul III formed the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza and Piacenza became part of this duchy. It voted for a union between it and Piedmont in May 1848; this union was enacted in 1859.

In October 2012, it was confirmed that the province of Piacenza would be merged with the province of Parma in 2014 to become the Province of Piacenza and Parma, despite controversy over the chosen name. However, after the dismissal of premier Mario Monti, the provincial union was cancelled.

==Geography==
The province of Piacenza is the westernmost of the nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in northwestern Italy. It is bounded on the east by the province of Parma, and to the north by the province of Cremona, the province of Lodi, and the province of Pavia in the region of Lombardy. The province of Alessandria lies to the west in the region of Piedmont, and to the south lies the province of Genoa, in the region of Liguria.

The northernmost part of the province is largely flat but the southernmost two thirds are hilly and extend to the Ligurian Apennine Mountains; the highest point in the province is the peak of Monte Bue which is above sea level. The alluvial Po Plain is agricultural land and there are many vineyards growing grapes from which the eighteen wines of the region are made. There is some light industry, mostly in the mechanical sector, and some of this is linked to the agriculture sector.

<doc id="987132" wikidata="Q1576258" url="?curid=987132" title="United States Constabulary">
<text>The United States Constabulary was a United States Army military gendarmerie force. From 1946 to 1952, in the aftermath of World War II, it acted as an occupation and security force in the U.S. Occupation Zone of West Germany and Austria.

==Reason==
The concept of a police-type occupation of Germany arose from the consideration of plans for the most efficient employment of the relatively small forces available.

The speed of redeployment in the fall of 1945, and the certainty that the occupational troop basis would have to be reduced speedily, dictated the utmost economy in the use of manpower. The basic principle of the police-type occupation—that the lack of strength in the forces of occupation must be made up for by careful selection, rigid training, and high mobility—cannot be attributed to any single individual, or indeed to any single agency. Before any plans were worked out for the organization of the United States Constabulary, units of the United States Army assigned to occupational duties in Germany had experimented with the organization of parts of their forces into motorized patrols for guarding the borders and maintaining order in the large areas for which they were responsible. In September 1945, the G-2 Division of European Theater Headquarters put forward a plan, which was carried into effect towards the end of the years for the organization of a special security force known as the District Constabulary. In October 1945, the War Department asked European Theater Headquarters to consider the feasibility of organizing the major portion of the occupational forces into an efficient military police force on the model of state police or constabulary in the United States.

Ideas crystallized rapidly. At the end of October 1945, General Eisenhower, announced to the proper authorities that the population of the United States Zone of Germany would ultimately be controlled by a super-police force or constabulary. In early November, the strength of the proposed constabulary was announced as 38,000. Planning was well advanced by the end of 1945, when the European Theater Headquarters notified the War Department that the constabulary would be organized as an elite force, composed of the highest caliber personnel obtainable under the voluntary re-enlistment program, and that it would be equipped with an efficient communications network, sufficient vehicles and liaison airplanes to make it highly mobile, and the most modern weapons. During the paper stage, the organization was known by a series of names. &quot;State Police&quot; was discarded for &quot;State Constabulary.&quot; Then it was thought that &quot;State&quot; would be confusing, as the main United States Zone of Germany had been divided, for purposes of civil administration, into three states, or Länder. When the organization emerged from the planning stage, it was known as the &quot;Zone Constabulary,&quot; but before it became operational it was named &quot;United States Constabulary.&quot;

==Command and staff==
On 10 January 1946, Major General Ernest N. Harmon, wartime commander of the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions and the XXII Corps, was appointed Commanding General of the United States Constabulary.

At the direction of Lieutenant General Lucian K. Truscott, Commanding General, Third United States Army, a small group was detailed to assist General Harmon in carrying forward the planning for the new force. Its headquarters was established at Bad Tölz. Theater Headquarters had already announced the principle that the Constabulary would be organized along geographical lines to coincide as nearly as possible with the major divisions of the German civil administration, in order to facilitate liaison with the German police and United States Offices of Military Government. Thus, there would be one Constabulary Headquarters for the entire United States Zone, a brigade headquarters at each of the capitals of the three German &quot;Länder,&quot; and group, squadron, and troop headquarters established at points selected for ease in performing the mission. Theater Headquarters had also directed that the organization charts of the Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron would be used in planning the organization of the Constabulary.

The primary unit of the Constabulary, the troop, was organized on the pattern of the mechanized cavalry troop used in the war. In view of its tasks of road and border patrolling and its police-type jobs, the Constabulary needed a greater number of hand weapons and light vehicles, such as jeeps and armored cars. Each troop was divided for patrolling purposes into sections or teams, each of which was equipped with three jeeps and one armored car serving as a command vehicle and as support in case of emergency. A mobile reserve of one company equipped with light tanks was established in each Constabulary regiment. Horses were provided for patrolling in difficult terrain along the borders and motorcycles for the control of traffic on the super-highways (Autobahnen). Static border control posts were established at the crossing points.

==Uniforms==

The uniform of the Constabulary trooper was designed both to make him easily recognizable and to distinguish him as a member of an elite force. The &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; shoulder patch consisting of a circular yellow shoulder patch with the border of the patch and the letter &quot;C&quot; in the middle being in blue. A red lightning bolt appeared diagonally angled downward from right to left in the center of the &quot;C&quot;. The yellow, blue, and red combined the colors of the cavalry, infantry, and artillery. Their motto was &quot;Mobility, Vigilance, Justice.&quot; To make the troops more distinctive they were given US Cavalry bright golden yellow scarves, combat boots with a smooth outer surface designed to be spit shined, and helmet liners bearing the Constabulary insignia and yellow and blue stripes. One ex-member of the force remembered being called a &quot;circle C cowboy&quot; by soldiers from American regular army units.

==Creation==
To create a high morale in the Constabulary as quickly as possible, elements of the 1st and 4th Armored Divisions and certain cavalry groups were assigned to form the basis for the new organization. The units converted into Constabulary squadrons and regiments included armored infantry, field artillery, tank, tank destroyer, antiaircraft battalions, and cavalry squadrons.

The Constabulary was also called the &quot;Circle C Cowboys&quot; because they had approximately 300 horses on duty in Berlin, the U.S. Zone of Germany, and Austria, with two veterinarians to treat them.

==Organization==
The VI Corps Headquarters became &quot;Headquarters, United States Constabulary&quot; on 1 May 1946. The 1st Armored Division, activated at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in June 1940 and one of the first American divisions to fight on the other side of the Atlantic, supplied many tank and infantry units. The 4th Armored Division furnished the three brigade headquarters for the Constabulary.

These veteran units, seriously depleted by redeployment, now approached a task quite different from that of waging war, but one demanding initiative and high standards in training and discipline. Some of the combat units assigned to the Constabulary were carried temporarily as mere paper organizations, redeployment having taken all their officers and men. Other units had up to 75 percent of their allotted strength, but all the units taken together averaged only 25 percent of their authorized strength.

In February 1946, Constabulary Headquarters was established in Bamberg. During the period when tactical units, released from the Third and Seventh Armies, were being redesignated as Constabulary units, the main tasks were training and reorganization. Continuous training was prescribed for the trooper so that he might attain an acceptable standard of discipline and all around efficiency in the use of weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment.

==Education and training==
Early in the planning stage the need for a Constabulary School became evident.

The Constabulary trooper, it was seen, must know, not only the customary duties of a soldier, but also police methods, how to make arrests, and how to deal with a foreign population. A school was also needed to develop among the members of the Constabulary a spirit which would lift them towards the required high standards of personal appearance, soldierly discipline, and unquestioned personal integrity. The Constabulary School was established at Sonthofen, Germany, in a winter sports area at the foot of the Allgau Alps. This citadel had been formerly used as a Nazi school to train youthful candidates for positions of leadership in the Party. The curriculum for Constabulary officers and noncommissioned officers included instruction in the geography, history, and politics of Germany. The technical and specialist training for the trooper included the theory and practice of criminal investigation, police records, self-defense, and the apprehension of wanted persons. The trooper&#x27;s indoctrination in the mission of the Constabulary gave him a knowledge of his responsibilities and the functions of the Constabulary. The Constabulary School had standards comparable to those of Army Service Schools in the United States. A graduate of Sonthofen was qualified, not only to perform his duties, but also to serve as an instructor in his unit. By the end of 1946, 5,700 officers and enlisted personnel had been graduated.

A Trooper&#x27;s Handbook was written to cover the basic rules to be followed by him in the execution of his duties. To prepare this manual, the Constabulary obtained the services of Colonel J. H. Harwood, formerly State Police Commissioner of Rhode Island.

The training program, as originally planned, aimed at the progressive development of the Constabulary so as to attain a common standard of efficiency throughout the organization. 1 July 1946 was set as the date upon which the Constabulary would become operational and, in preparation for that day, the training program was divided into three phases. During the first phase, prior to 1 April, attention was concentrated on the training of cadre and on the establishment of regimental and squadron headquarters so that the Constabulary would be prepared to receive the approximately 20,000 men expected to fill the ranks. During this phase, the emphasis from the point of view of control by the main headquarters was shifted from the squadron to the regiment, since each of the latter directed three of the former. The second phase, between 1 April and 1 June, was a period of intensive training in the duties of both individuals and units. The final phase was planned as on-the-job training during June. The last phase, however, was not completed because of delay in receiving reinforcements.

The Constabulary became operational on 1 July 1946 as scheduled, despite the fact that its training program had not been completed. Changes in the redeployment rules caused the loss within a few weeks of 8,000 troopers, 25 percent of the total strength. During the first two months of operations 14,000 men, or 42.7 percent of the total strength, were lost through redeployment. The replacement and training task at that time were staggering. To make matters worse, there was a critical shortage in the Constabulary of junior officers during the late summer of 1946. This delayed the Constabulary in attaining the desired standards in discipline and operations, and was the cause of many changes in operational techniques.

Despite all of these difficulties, the Constabulary attained its goal of selecting high caliber personnel. The main reason for seeking troopers of high caliber and for giving them higher ratings than are available in other military organizations was the realization that the Constabulary was only as good as the individual trooper. Small groups of two or three troopers operated far from their headquarters and were empowered with unusual authority in matters of arrest, search, and seizure. In conducting their daily duties, they faced many temptations, such as those offered by persons willing to pay almost any price for immunity after crossing the border, or for illegal concessions in the black market. Maintaining high standards in the Constabulary was all the more difficult because most of the combat veterans had gone home and had been replaced by men in the age group of 18 to 22 years.

==Mission==

The mission of the United States Constabulary was to maintain general military and civil security, to assist in the accomplishment of the objectives of the United States government in Germany, and to control the borders of the United States Zone.

The Constabulary set up a system of patrols throughout the entire area and along the borders. The territory to be patrolled had an area of over 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) and included nearly 1,400 miles of international and interzonal boundaries, extending from Austria in the South to the British Zone in the North, and from Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Zone in the East to the Rhine River and the French Zone in the West. Approximately the area of Pennsylvania in size, the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany had similar contours, with flat lands, hills, mountains, and forests, crisscrossed by many rivers and streams. More than sixteen million German people lived in this area, and it included many cities of considerable size. The entire Zone was covered by a network of roads, while here and there were the Autobahnen—the four-lane express highways.

==Operations==

At first the Constabulary tried to patrol everywhere in the Zone.

Troopers traveled on country roads, through small villages, over narrow and rough mountainous roads. They moved up and down the streets of large cities like Munich and Stuttgart, and of the smaller ones like Fritzlar, Weiden, Hof, and Passau—names which have become as familiar to the Constabulary trooper as Pittsburgh, Akron, Richmond, Clay Center, and Abilene. Wherever patrols operated, they were in constant communication by radio or telephone with their platoon or troop headquarters, which were in turn linked in a chain of communications reaching up to Constabulary Headquarters. The telephone lines used by the Constabulary were, for the most part, those of the German system, although some military lines and equipment were also available. In addition to radio and telephone, the Constabulary was hooked up in a teletype system, which was the most comprehensive and effective communications network operated by the United States Army in Europe.

In the performance of their mission, Constabulary patrols visited periodically the German mayors (Bürgermeister), German police stations, United States investigating agencies, and other military units in their areas. They were always prepared to assist any one or all of these. Like the State police units in the United States, Constabulary patrols worked closely with the municipal, rural, and border police, even though the German police were part of the administration of an occupied country. The Constabulary troopers became acquainted with the local policemen, received reports from them of what occurred since the last visit, and worked out with them methods of trapping criminals and of forestalling possible disturbances.

As they roamed their beat in their yellow and blue striped jeep, each pair of Constabulary troopers was usually accompanied by a German policeman who rode in the back seat. The German policeman knew some English and the troopers were trained at the Constabulary school to understand a number of German phrases useful in police work. If the patrol investigated a disturbance in a German home, the troopers stood by while the German officer made the arrest. If they apprehended suspected displaced persons outside their camp, the troopers again stood by while the German policeman handled the situation. If the offender was an American or Allied soldier or civilian, the troopers made the arrest. This procedure built up the prestige of the new German police in the eyes of their own people.

Border control was an important element in the security of the United States Zone. On 1 July 1946, the Constabulary replaced the troopers of the 1st, 3d, and 9th Infantry Divisions at the many static control posts along the borders. At these border posts, often in isolated locations, Allied soldiers met and exchanged greetings across the red and white barricades as they performed their duties of customs inspection, passport control, and law enforcement. During the second half of 1946, 120 border posts employing 2,800 Constabulary troopers turned back from the border over 26,000 undocumented transients. An additional 22,000 illegal crossers were apprehended by patrols within the ten-mile (16 km) border zone and turned over to military government. As the patrols of the Constabulary increased, illegal crossings showed a downward trend because travelers became aware of the regulations and the effectiveness of the Constabulary in their enforcement.

==Modernization==
As a result of continuous study of crime statistics, emphasizing the location and time of commission, the patrolling of the interior areas of the American Zone was modified so as to provide for more frequent visits to disorderly areas than to the relatively quiet localities.

The potential sources of trouble were judged to be, not in rural areas where peasants gazed in wonder at Constabulary patrols, but in areas where large urban populations scrambled among ruins for food and for jerry-built shelter. Here the patrols, passing every two hours, found that they were missing the real disturbances. Night reports of holidays and weekends told of assaults, robbery, and other serious crimes being perpetrated, but too often the Constabulary was not on the spot to act. Operating procedures were changed to provide for concentration on the high-incident areas at critical times. In large cities, tanks, armored cars, and jeeps of the Constabulary paraded in the streets in considerable numbers to show the Germans that the Americans meant business, and were properly trained and equipped to meet emergencies.

==Troopers&#x27; lives==
As the Constabulary trooper became accustomed to his duties, he gained more confidence and self-assurance. He possessed a thorough knowledge of police functions; he learned not to abuse his authority. No situation seemed insoluble. Consequently, two or three men could answer a call for assistance where formerly a section or more had gone out.

In the &quot;Kaserne&quot; the trooper had the recreational facilities and comforts which constituted his home life in Germany—Service Men&#x27;s Clubs with their snack bars and entertainments, motion pictures, American Red Cross facilities, and trans-Atlantic telephone service. The trooper whose family lived in a military community found living and recreation within his means. All members of the Constabulary and their families had the possibility of wide-ranging travel in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy.

During the first six months of its activities the Constabulary made 168,000 patrols in jeeps, tanks, and armored cars, and on horseback and on foot. Its troopers traveled on these patrols more than five million miles, mostly in jeeps. The mileage covered by the vehicles of the United States Constabulary was equivalent to nine vehicles circling the earth every twenty-four hours. The mileage covered by foot patrols was equivalent to circling the globe once each week. The liaison airplanes of the Constabulary flew more than 14,000 hours on 11,000 missions during the first six months&#x27; period.

In 1946, the Constabulary made many swoop raids, known officially as &quot;check and search operations,&quot; against displaced persons&#x27; and refugees&#x27; camps and the German population. No raids were made unless requested by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, military commanders, military government, or investigative agencies which had reason to suspect black-market or subversive activities. The trooper operating in the municipalities was a deterrent to the individuals and groups who were the mainstay of the black market. In six months, 2,681 black-market transactions and 173 subversive acts were uncovered in Constabulary operations.

The Constabulary assisted military government in the reorganization and development of the German police force. The Constabulary realized that its task would be greatly simplified with an increase in the strength and efficiency of the German police, a rise in the self-confidence of German police officers, and a gain in their prestige in the eyes of the civilian population. The ties between the two law-enforcement agencies steadily became stronger. The Constabulary left the less important matters in the hands of the German police and concentrated more and more on the apprehension of major criminals and black marketeers. Eventually, the United States Constabulary played mainly the role of adviser and supporter, ready to assist the German police on call.

==Equipment==
From the beginning, the Constabulary set high standards for itself.

===Vehicles===
The troopers were selected from the best soldiers available, and it was desired that all of them be volunteers. They were to be trained as both soldiers and policemen. They were to operate in an efficient, alert manner calculated to inspire confidence and respect in all persons they met, whether Germans, Allies, or Americans. Next to its need for well-qualified men, the Constabulary depended most, for success in its mission, upon its system of communications and upon vehicles suited to the needs of the job and to the condition of the German roads. Better radio equipment was being furnished at the end of 1946, though it was not yet of the standard of that used by State Police and Highway Patrol forces at home. The German telephone system, hampered by a lack of spare parts, was not in good condition. The jeep, while excellent for combat, did not prove to be the best vehicle for Constabulary patrol work. There were far too many accidents and some of them were undoubtedly due to defects in the design of the jeep with reference to the road conditions encountered. The jeep&#x27;s best points were that it had the power and the sturdiness to travel German roads, then in a bad state of repair. If the roads were better maintained, the sedan would be a more satisfactory patrol vehicle. The Constabulary also made use of the M8 Greyhound armoured car and M24 Chaffee light tank.

To maintain its mobility, the Constabulary waged a constant struggle to overcome deficiencies in its transportation facilities. The vehicles originally issued to the Constabulary, numbering approximately 10,000, were taken from the large concentrations of combat motor vehicles left behind by units returning to the United States for demobilization. Many of these vehicles were already worn out in the campaign and many others had deteriorated in disuse. The original condition of the vehicles placed a severe test upon the Constabulary which, at the time it was inaugurated, had no service elements.

===Weaponry===
The standard shoulder weapons of the Constabulary included the .30-06 cal M1 Garand rifle, .30-cal M1/M2 carbines, and .45-cal M1/M1A1Thompson submachine gun or M3 grease gun. Additionally, each Constabulary member was issued an M1911A1 .45 pistol. The standard 13-man (reconnaissance) patrol had seven rifle and five sub-machine gun armed men.

==Strength==

The US Constabulary consisted of up to 38,000 men organized into:

* Headquarters, United States Constabulary,
**Located first at Bamberg then moved to Stuttgart.
* Three Brigades,
**1st, 2nd and 3rd
* 10 Regiments,
** 1st through 3rd and 5th through 9th, assigned to the brigades.
** The 4th Regiment, an independent unit with:
***Two squadrons in Austria and
***One squadron in West Berlin.
Controlling:
** Thirty Squadrons.
***Each battalion-size squadron had five (at first) and then later on only four company-size troops.

==Disbanding==
The Constabulary was disbanded in 1952, after Germany had developed its own police forces. Many of the Constabulary troopers returned home and joined local and state police forces.

As the perception of the threat to border security changed from one of criminal activity to a potential invasion by the Soviet Army, the border operations mission along the Soviet zones in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria was taken over by armored cavalry units of the U.S. Army.

While the Constabulary did not have a direct successor, its duty of close cooperation with German authorities is now maintained by Military and Civilian Police Officers of the U.S. Armed Forces. A strong working relationship continues to exist today between German Police Forces and United States Forces Europe Police who operate out of U.S. military installations throughout Germany. Joint patrols involving U.S. Military Police, U.S. Army Civilian Police, and local German Police are still relatively commonplace throughout towns near U.S. military installations in Germany. These patrols are directed at enhancing the safety and security of military and German communities by instilling a culture of mutual trust and cooperation between U.S. and German Police forces.

A small monument to the U.S. Constabulary was erected in 2008 on Patch Barracks in Germany.

<text>The first HMS &quot;Mersey&quot; was a 20-gun sixth-rate post ship, launched in 1814; she was re-rated as 26 guns in 1817. She was launched too late to see action in the Napoleonic War, though she nevertheless had a long and distinguished career that took her to Halifax Station in 1818 and then the South American station in 1824 until her departure in 1827, when she was then deployed to the Caribbean station from that year until 1831. She was eventually broken up in 1852.

<text>The second HMS &quot;Mersey&quot; was commissioned in 1858, six years after the first &quot;Mersey&quot; had been broken up. She and her sister ship the &quot;Orlando&quot; were the longest wooden warships built for the Royal Navy. At 336 feet in length, HMS &quot;Mersey&quot; was nearly twice the size of HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, the flagship of Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar. At 5643 tons displacement, she was certainly a large and impressive looking ship in her day. She was heavily armed, and in comparison to many of her counterparts was quite fast with an approximate speed of 12½ knots, achieving 13½ on trials.

The length, the unique aspect of the ship, was actually an Achilles&#x27; heel of the &quot;Mersey&quot; and &quot;Orlando&quot;. The extreme length of the ship put enormous strains on her hull due to the unusual merging of heavy machinery, and a lengthy wooden hull, resulting in her seams opening up. They were pushing the limits of what was possible in wooden ship construction:

In 1875 &quot;Mersey&quot; was laid up and sold for breaking. Some of her masts were installed on , which was then being refitted at Portsmouth.

They were relatively modern, in that they were the first cruisers that had discarded their sailing rigs in the design, that was synonymous with the old wooden warships, and were now solely steam powered warships. She was built at Chatham Dockyard and launched on 31 March 1885, but had a relatively mundane career and was sold for breaking in 1905.

<text>HMS &quot;Mersey was a [[monitor warship type|monitor]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Originally built by [[Vickers]] for the [[Brazilian Navy]] and christened Madeira&quot;, she was purchased by the Royal Navy in 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War along with her sister ships and .

==Service history==
&quot;Mersey&quot; had a relatively successful career in the First World War and had two prominent incidents. At the Battle of the Yser in 1914, off the coast of Belgium, she bombarded German troops as well as artillery positions. In July 1915, she was towed to the Rufiji River delta in German East Africa, where she and &quot;Severn&quot; then assisted in the destruction of the German light cruiser .

On 6 July 1915 the two monitors undertook an extended engagement with the Königsberg, which had taken shelter in the shallow waters of the Rufiji Delta. The &quot;Mersey&quot; had its fore 6in. gun disabled in this initial action. Returning on 11 July the two monitors caused extensive damage to the German ship, forcing it to be scuttled.

The monitor later went to the Mediterranean and served on the River Danube.

Five crew died between January 3 and January 6, 1919. They are buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Bucharest War Cemetery.

In 1921, she was sold to the breakers.

<doc id="987142" wikidata="Q3241883" url="?curid=987142" title="Hurricane Anita">
<text>Hurricane Anita was a powerful tropical cyclone during the otherwise quiet 1977 Atlantic hurricane season, and the latest first named storm on record since tropical cyclones were first named in 1950. The first tropical cyclone of the season, Anita developed from a tropical wave on August 29 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. It tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development, and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on August 30. Initially, Anita was forecast to strike Texas, though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest. The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane. It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico, and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. Anita was the first major hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Eloise of 1975.

The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52 inches (445 mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5 mph (7 km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230 miles (370 km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.

With a ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

Hurricane Anita maintained its strength as it approached land, and at 1100 UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, about 145 miles (235 km) south of Brownsville, Texas or 80 miles (130 km) north of Tampico, Mexico. Moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar, Anita was the most intense hurricane to strike the nation from the Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and on September 3, about 25 hours after moving ashore, Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven, the system continued to the west, and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures. The depression gradually lost its deep convection, and on September 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.

==Preparations==

Shortly after first developing, one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.

Though the National Hurricane Center did not issue hurricane warnings for Mexico, officials warned the Mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane. Across the northeastern coastline of the country, 35,000 people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane, including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck. The Mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters.

==Impact==
===United States===
As the precursor tropical disturbance crossed southern Florida, it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch (25 mm) in the Miami area. Later, as a developing tropical depression, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches (76 mm) of precipitation. Hurricane Anita produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.6 m) above normal in Grand Isle, which resulted in hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes.

The hurricane produced above-normal tides along the Texas coastline, which closed several highways including Texas State Highway 87. The northern periphery of Hurricane Anita produced light to moderate rainfall across the southern portion of the state, which peaked at 4.97 inches (126 mm) at Rio Grande City. Damage in the state was minor; on South Padre Island damage was limited to a few broken windows.

===Mexico===

Hurricane Anita made landfall in a sparsely populated portion of Mexico; as a result, few meteorological statistics exist. A station near where the hurricane moved ashore recorded 17.52 inches (445 mm) of precipitation in six hours, which resulted in severe flooding and mudslides. Winds along the eastern Mexico coastline were estimated at over 100 mph (160 km/h).

The hurricane caused extensive damage to fishing and farming communities in northeastern Mexico. Strong winds destroyed thousands of homes and left about 25,000 people homeless, according to newspaper reports from Mexico City. The winds destroyed the roofs of most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore, and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications. Heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region, with some flooded avenues in Tampico and reports of flooded highways near Ciudad Victoria. Eleven people were killed in floods and mudslides across Tamaulipas. In all, at least 50,000 people were affected by the hurricane in Mexico.

==Aftermath==

Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact. Additionally, officials permitted full use of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid. Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm. In Texas, the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides in low-lying marshland led to a mosquito outbreak near Galveston following the storm.

On account of the severe damage caused by the hurricane in the Atlantic basin, the name &quot;Anita&quot; was retired at the end of the 1977 season. It will never again be used to name a tropical storm in the basin.

<text>HMS &quot;Mersey&quot; is a of the British Royal Navy. Named after the River Mersey, she is the fifth RN vessel to carry the name and the first to be named &quot;Mersey&quot; in 84 years. Various tenders were renamed &quot;Mersey&quot; during their service with Mersey Division Royal Naval Reserve (HMS &quot;Eaglet&quot;) between the early 1950s and late 1970s.

&quot;HMS Mersey&quot; was built by Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton, England to serve as a fishery protection vessel within the United Kingdom&#x27;s waters along with her two sister ships and . All three were commissioned into service in 2003 to replace the five older s. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 28 November 2003. At that time, &quot;Mersey&quot; was not expected to commence duties until February 2004.

&quot;Mersey&quot; was the last Royal Navy ship to be launched from Vosper Thornycroft at its Woolston shipyard; Jennie Reeve, wife of Rear-Admiral Jonathon Reeve, Chief of Fleet Support, was the ship&#x27;s sponsor.

==Operational history==

For the first thirteen years of operation, &quot;Mersey&quot; carried out fishery protection duties around the United Kingdom.

In May 2012, &quot;Mersey&quot; became the first command of Sarah Oakley.

In October 2013, &quot;Mersey&quot; was dry docked in Falmouth.

In January 2016, &quot;Mersey&quot; became the second River-class OPV to be deployed to the Caribbean Sea following on from her sister &quot;Severn&quot; in 2015. In May 2016, &quot;Mersey&quot; was dry docked in Martinique as part of her mid-deployment maintenance period. By July, &quot;Mersey&quot; had been relieved by and was deployed on migrant patrols in the Aegean via a port call in Gibraltar. &quot;Mersey&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 10 February 2017 after 13 months away to resume her fishery protection duties.

On 3 January 2019, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson confirmed that HMS &quot;Mersey&quot; has been deployed to assist UK and French authorities with illegal migrant crossings in the English Channel.

==Extended service==
On 24 April 2017, in a written answer to a question raised by Sir Nicholas Soames, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Harriett Baldwin stated that &quot;Mersey&quot; would be decommissioned in 2019.

In March 2018, Baldwin&#x27;s successor Guto Bebb revealed that £12.7M had been allocated from the EU Exit Preparedness Fund to preserve the three Batch 1 ships, should they be needed to control and enforce UK waters and fisheries following the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

On 22 November 2018, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that three Batch 1 River-class ships would be retained in service and forward operated from their affiliated ports. However, the idea of forward basing the Batch 1s was reportedly later abandoned. The ships are now to be retained in service until around 2028. As of late 2023, &quot;Mersey&quot; was scheduled to begin a major refit.

<text>The province of Ravenna (; ) is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Ravenna. As of 2015, it has a population of 391,997 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 210.81 inhabitants per square kilometre. Its provincial president is Claudio Casadio.

==History==
Ravenna was first inhabited by Italic tribes from northern regions, and was conquered in 191 BCE by the Roman Republic. A port was constructed near Classe, and the Adriatic fleet was based in Ravenna. In 402 CE, Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire, which endured until the collapse of the empire and the fall of Rome in 476. Following this, the Barbarian Kings Odoacer and then Theodoric controlled Ravenna until it was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 540; the Byzantines announced it to be their Exarchate.

It continued to be under Byzantine rule until it was invaded by the Lombards in 751, and it was then annexed by King of the Franks Pippin the Younger. It was placed under papal rule by Pippin the Younger in 756 or 757. Ravenna was subsequently ruled by the Holy See until it was given independence in the 12th century. The papacy gained control again in 1278 and was led by papal vicars until it was invaded by Venice in 1441. The War of the League of Cambrai took place near Ravenna in 1512, in which the papal forces were defeated, but the French forces were almost entirely killed and were driven from Italy. It remained under the rule of the Holy See until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

In 1921, uprisings in Ravenna triggered a rapid advance of the Fascist movement in the region. Buildings belonging to the Republicans and socialists were seized or burnt down by Italo Balbo, and on July 29, he and his men moved throughout the provinces of Ravenna and Forli, burning every socialist organisation headquarters in a night of terror which was later called the &quot;column of fire&quot;. This was a pivotal moment in the advance of Fascism in northern Italy.

==Geography==
The province of Ravenna is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. It is on the east of the region and abuts onto the Adriatic Sea. The province of Ferrara lies immediately to the north and the Metropolitan City of Bologna is to the west. The Metropolitan City of Florence in the region of Tuscany lies to the southwest, and the province of Forlì-Cesena to the south. The provincial capital is the city of Ravenna, which is situated a few miles inland and is connected to the Adriatic Sea by the Candiano Canal.

<doc id="987150" wikidata="Q3246566" url="?curid=987150" title="Hurricane Diana">
<text>Hurricane Diana was a deadly tropical cyclone which made landfall in Mexico in August 1990. The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the season, Diana developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean on August 4. Forming as a tropical depression, the system brushed Honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day. Continuing to gradually strengthen, Diana made its first landfall in Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula as a strong tropical storm late on August 5. The cyclone weakened slightly due to land interaction, before emerging into the Bay of Campeche on August 6. Once over water, warm sea surface temperatures allowed Diana to quickly become a hurricane and later peak as a Category 2 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on August 7. Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of . Rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of Mexico, with Diana diminishing to a tropical depression roughly 24 hours after moving onshore. The cyclone later emerged into the Gulf of California on August 9 shortly before dissipating. The remnant disturbance was monitored until losing its identity over Arizona on August 14.

Diana left relatively minor impacts in the Yucatán Peninsula. Some locations observed tropical storm-force sustained winds and gusts, while heavy rains left street flooding in the Chetumal area. Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the hurricane produced torrential rains exceeding in some places. The ensuing floods left about 3,500 people homeless and destroyed roughly of farmland. Numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris, cutting communication with several communities. In all, Diana killed 139 people in Mexico and resulted in approximately $90.7 million (1990 USD) in damage. The remnant disturbance caused street flooding in Arizona.

==Meteorological history==

Hurricane Diana originated from a tropical wave which emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 27. Unfavorable conditions initially prohibited tropical cyclogenesis, with the wave remaining disorganized until reaching the eastern Caribbean Sea. The system entered the Caribbean Sea through the southern Windward Islands, where barometric pressures fell slightly, decreasing by 3.5 mbar (hPa; 0.1 inHg) in 24 hours. Upper-level air data from the Lesser Antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone. The first reconnaissance aircraft flight into the wave indicated no low-level circulation, but a relatively large and increasing amount of thunderstorm activity. The system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the Netherlands Antilles, as indicated by satellite images and surface observations. After satellite imagery observed a cyclonic rotation in the low-level convection, the fifth tropical depression of the season developed over the Caribbean around 00:00 UTC on August 4, while located about east of Isla de Providencia. However, this was based on surface observations, and the formation of a tropical cyclone operationally remained unconfirmed until another reconnaissance aircraft flight later that day.

The depression initially moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough. Around 00:00 UTC on August 5, about 24 hours after developing, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm while offshore northeastern Honduras; the National Hurricane Center assigned the name Diana to the system. Diana would subsequently strengthen further, with winds reaching before the storm made landfall near Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, around 20:00 UTC later that day. The storm weakened while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Bay of Campeche early on August 6 with winds of . Upon entering the Bay of Campeche, Diana began moving nearly due west as a result of a weakening trough of low pressure. With conditions being more favorable in the Bay of Campeche, Diana quickly intensified, becoming a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on August 7. Twelve hours later, the cyclone intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; ). At 19:00 UTC on August 7, just one hour after attaining peak intensity, Diana made landfall in Tamiahua, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity.

Moving inland, Diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of Mexico, quickly deteriorating from a low-end Category 2 hurricane to a strong tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on August 8. The system continued westward and weakened to a tropical depression roughly 12 hours later while centered near Mexico City. The weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central Mexico and emerged into the Pacific Ocean on August 9, before dissipating as a tropical cyclone over the Gulf of California. The remnants of Diana curved northward around the eastern periphery of an upper-cyclone and tracked through the Gulf of California. Convection flared up before the remnant disturbance moved ashore in northwestern Sonora. The remnants of Diana entered Arizona and dissipated by early on August 14.

==Preparations==

In anticipation of Diana&#x27;s first landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued on August 5 for Cancún, Mexico, southward to Belize City, Belize, on August 5, including the offshore islands from both nations; a tropical storm warning indicates that tropical storm force winds, , are expected within 24 hours. Eleven hours later, the tropical storm warning was extended as far as Carmen, but was discontinued for the entire east coast of Belize. Civil defense officials in Quintana Roo recommended that residents in coastal areas and in homes with weak construction to evacuate. The civil defense also set up emergency shelters in Punta Allen, Punta Herrero, and Xcalak. The Mexican Coast Guard was placed on alert and shipping activity around Quintana Roo ceased during the evening of August 5, as tides were expected to range from above normal. Additionally, officials expressed concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of of rainfall in areas near the storm&#x27;s path. After Diana made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August 6, all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinued.

Diana then threatened the mainland east coast of Mexico. A hurricane watch was issued for Tuxpan to Boca de Jesus Maria at 21:00 UTC on August 6; a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours, such as winds of at least . Early on August 7, the National Hurricane Center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours, and as a result, a hurricane warning was issued for Nautla to Le Pesca. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued for La Pesca to Boca de Jesus Maria. Later that day, a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area, stretching from Nautla to Lerdo de Tejada. The National Hurricane Center also predicted precipitation totals of and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where Diana was projected to make landfall. According to Miguelangel Rebolledo, the captain of the port of Tuxpan, about 300 people fled low-lying areas. State and federal officials prepared 10,000 packages of emergency supplies, food, and medicine and moved them to several locations along the coast. Police and Armed Forces were placed on alert. By 00:00 UTC on August 8, all of the watches and warnings in place were officially discontinued.

==Impact==
===Mexico===
Offshore Quintana Roo, the island of Cozumel reported sustained winds of . While crossing over the Yucatán Peninsula, sustained winds of and gusts to were observed in Mérida. In addition, wind gusts of were reported in the towns of Felipe Carrillo Puerto and José María Morelos, respectively. Diana also caused heavy rain across the area, though damage is unknown. Due to heavy rainfall, minor street flooding occurred in Chetumal, Quintana Roo.

Along the Gulf of Mexico, the storm produced storm surge and abnormally high tides, with waves up to in height. Rough seas resulted in the closures of the ports at Coatzacoalcos and Tampico. Diana produced torrential rainfall while crossing the country, which peaked at in Aquismón, San Luis Potosí. Heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and flooding, mostly in the east-central portion of Mexico. The Comisión Nacional del Agua noted that at least seven rivers in the lower Pánuco River basin threatened to overflow their banks in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas. The rainfall caused extensive property damage, destroying numerous houses and leaving 3,500 homeless. Flooding inundated highways and railways across six states and destroyed about of farmland.

The states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla were hardest hit, with over 75,000 people affected by the hurricane. In Poza Rica, high winds toppled trees and electricity poles, which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city. Fallen trees and telephone wires also blocked some streets in the area, but the major roads remained open. Farther south, flooding left Federal Highway 185 impassable near Coatzacoalcos for a few days. Approximately 80% of apple, coffee, peach, and pear crops were lost in the municipality of Huayacocotla. In Pánuco, flooding forced more than 2,000 families to flee their homes. Diana caused at least 20 deaths and left 18 people missing in the city. Local crops experienced significant damage, especially cotton, rice, and soybeans. Throughout the state of Veracruz, the storm destroyed about of banana, citrus, corn, and cotton crops.

In Hidalgo, several miners died after their truck plunged into a ravine. The San Juan River overflowed in the town of Huejutla de Reyes, sweeping away hundreds of homes and some people in one neighborhood. Diana also damaged at least 110 schools and 25 public buildings throughout in Hidalgo. Flooding washed out or damaged four federal highways and six state highways. The agricultural industry in Hidalgo, which had not fully recovered from a severe frost in December 1988, experienced significant effects. About of croplands suffered damage, mainly impacting coffee, rice, and bean crops.
Excluding the 56 people still missing by the end of 1990, Diana caused at least 139 deaths and $90.7 million in damage. However, some sources claim that there were as much as 391 fatalities and losses incurred by the storm totaled to $94.5 million. In addition, it is estimated that Diana injured 25,000 people.

===Elsewhere===
While Diana was crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, it dropped light rainfall in Belize, peaking at in an unspecified location. The remnants of Hurricane Diana eventually moved into the Southwestern United States, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. In Imperial County, California, golf-ball sized hail was reported by the residents, along with rain and lightning, causing brief power outages throughout the county. A police dispatch of Imperial County also noted local flooding, which resulted in traffic disruptions. The remnants of Diana also dropped light rainfall in San Diego County, California, with the city of San Diego receiving only a trace of rain, Vista reporting , Del Mar had , and Oceanside measuring .

In Arizona, the remnants of Diana contributed to record cold temperatures for August in Phoenix. On August 14, the city had a high temperature of , which was below normal for that date. In Maricopa County, of rain was observed. Heavy precipitation, with in Desert Hills, which fell in less than two hours. Several weather-related car accidents occurred, but none were serious. In Apache Junction, police and city officials rushed to close flooded streets, including portions of state highways and underpasses of Interstate 17. Crews were pumping of water from the underpasses of Interstate 17, but their efforts were futile. A portion of State Route 87 between Gila River Indian Community and the intersection with State Route 187 was shut down due to flooding. In Sacaton, about two-thirds of the city was inundated with at least of water.

==Aftermath==

Following the storm, the Mexican Armed Forces delivered food and basic health care supplies to victims. In addition, there was also a mass vaccination against typhoid. Officials delivered about 8,000 boxes of blankets, clothing, and food in total to the 55 worst impacted communities in Veracruz. The Mexican Army and Civil Defense of Veracruz deployed 36 medical brigades to attend to those injured during the storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI 8/12 p. 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By August 11, 120 families in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region of Puebla had received construction materials to rebuild their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI 8/12 p. 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the storm&#x27;s impact, the name &quot;Diana&quot; was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1991, and will never be used again for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with &quot;Dolly&quot; for the 1996 season.

<doc id="987152" wikidata="Q6942258" url="?curid=987152" title="Music of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines">
<text>The music of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines includes thriving music scenes based on Big Drum, calypso, soca, steelpan and also reggae. String band music, quadrille, bélé music and traditional storytelling are also popular.

==Soca==

Soca is a form of dance music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago from calypso music. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from Trinidad, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, some bands from Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Haiti, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles.

The nickname of the Trinidad and Tobago national football team, the Soca Warriors, refers to this musical genre.

==Big drum==

Big drum music is performed throughout the Windward Islands and is especially known in Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines. The drums are traditionally made from tree trunks, but are more often made from rum kegs now. The socially aware or satirical lyrics are usually performed by a female singer called a &quot;chantwell&quot;, and is accompanied by dancers in colorful skirts and headdresses. Big Drum is commonly performed at weddings and other celebrations, especially the launches of boats.

==Calypso==

Calypso, with its satirical and socio-political lyrics, was developed in the 18th century as a fusion of African and French music styles. It eventually accompanied the rise of steelpan music. Steelpan were imported to Saint Vincent quickly. Calypso&#x27;s political lyrics have continued to be an important part of the genre. In 1984, a Vincentian musician named Becket released a song called &quot;Horne fug Dem&quot;, which helped defeat the ruling party in that year&#x27;s election.

==Festivals and holidays==
The Carnival is the biggest holiday in Saint Vincent. It is held in the last week of June and the first of July, and is known on the islands as &quot;Vincy mas&quot;. Festivities include calypso, soca and steelpan performances, many of them in large, competitive formats.

Other holidays with musical components include the Christmas celebrations, which occur beginning on December 15 and include carolling, concerts and bicycle races. In addition St. Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the festival “Nine Mornings” and “Nine Nights of Lights”. Union Island holds an annual calypso competition, as well as the Big Drum Festival.

==Popular singers==
The lead singer from the band Mattafix, known for their hit single &quot;Big City Life&quot;, lived in St. Vincent for many years. A multi-platinum popular singer is Kevin Lyttle, whose &quot;Turn Me On&quot; topped charts across Europe. Becket Cyrus is also well known within the island, with his hit &quot;Teaser&quot; earlier on in the country&#x27;s history. Of the late there have been quite a lot of young and upcoming artists whose music is spreading throughout the Caribbean and the United States. These include Bomani, Skarpyon, and Jamesy P. Some of the Vincentian recording studios are: Skakes Studio, JR Studios, Sky studio, Non-fiction Recordings, Masterroom and Hysyanz. Also, the ever popular Award Winning Soca Artist &quot;MaddZart&quot;, who is noted for his collaboration with Kevin Lyttle in the hit song &#x27;Turn Me On&#x27; and his most recent launch of the Caribbean Nights Series in NYC, as well as his 2016 songs &#x27;Function&#x27;, &#x27;Roll Bumper&#x27;, &#x27;Larger than Life&#x27;, &#x27;Designated Drinker&#x27; and &#x27;All Hands&#x27; reaching radio station globally. MaddZart is a repeat winner of the Raga Soca Competition, which is an integral part of the Vincentian Carnival. And now most recently Problem Child has come onto the scene, who in July 2007 became the local carnival Road March winner with his hit song, &quot;Party Animal&quot;, which also propelled him to Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s 2008 Carnival&#x27;s Soca monarch finals. Also his brother Skinny Fabulous had a song that took him to Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s 2009 Soca Monarch Finals with his song &quot;De Beast Leh Go&quot;.

<doc id="987153" wikidata="Q512849" url="?curid=987153" title="NBA 2K">
<text>NBA 2K is a series of basketball sports simulation video games developed by Visual Concepts and released annually since 1999. The premise of the series is to emulate the sport of basketball, and more specifically, the National Basketball Association.

The series was originally published by Sega. Beginning with 2005&#x27;s &quot;NBA 2K6&quot;, the series is currently published by 2K (previously under the 2K Sports sub-label). As of 2024, the series consists of twenty-five main installments and several spinoff titles across eighteen different platforms. An official eSports league, the &quot;NBA 2K League&quot;, launched in 2018.

Until 2018, the series&#x27; primary rival was EA Sports&#x27; &quot;NBA Live&quot; series.

==Gameplay==
Each installment in the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series emulates the National Basketball Association, and present slight improvements over the previous installments. As such, gameplay simulates a typical game of basketball, with the player controlling an entire team or a select player; objectives coincide with the rules of basketball and presentation resembles actual televised NBA games. Various game modes have been featured in the series, allowing for gameplay variety. Numerous elements of the games feature customizable options. Each game features the teams and players from the current NBA season; historic NBA teams and players have also been featured, as have EuroLeague teams and (starting with &quot;NBA 2K20&quot;) WNBA teams. Fictional players and teams can also be created and compiled.

A staple of the series is its career mode, which has been described as a sports-themed role-playing video game. &quot;ESPN NBA Basketball&quot; was the first game in the series to feature such a mode, but it wasn&#x27;t until &quot;NBA 2K10&quot; and its successors that the mode became a more integral part of the series. The mode was initially titled 24/7, before being changed to MyPlayer, and settling on MyCareer. The modes center on the basketball career of the player&#x27;s created player; the player customizes several aspects of their player and plays through their career in the NBA. Key events in the player&#x27;s career are depicted, such as the draft and their retirement ceremony. A storyline is often present in the modes, and high school and college-level basketball has also been depicted. The player upgrades their player&#x27;s attributes as they play, and can participate in off-court activities.

Another mainstay of the series is a mode allowing the player to assume control of an NBA franchise, acting as general manager. The mode has been featured in numerous &quot;NBA 2K&quot; games and is often titled Association; the most recent games in the series feature the MyGM and MyLeague modes. In the modes, the player controls virtually all aspects of a team, rather than just playing games with the team. As the player simulates through seasons, they must satisfy the needs of the team&#x27;s personnel and the owner.

MyTeam mode, which was introduced in &quot;NBA 2K13&quot;, focuses on building a team of players and competing against other players&#x27; teams online. The player&#x27;s primary venue for acquiring players for their team is card packs; the player purchases a card pack, which features random items the player can use in the mode, including players. In addition to compiling a select group of players, the player can also customize their team&#x27;s jerseys and court, among other things. The game mode progressed even further on &quot;NBA 2K19&quot;, with a MyTeam tournament between the best Xbox and PS4 players for a prize of $250,000 occurring. Other online-focused modes have also been featured in the series, such as Pro-Am, which focuses on players building a team together with their custom players.

In addition to regulation NBA games, street basketball has been featured in numerous games in the series. Created players and real players can be used in such modes; additionally, some celebrities have made appearances as playable characters in the series. In more recent games, the street basketball modes are titled Blacktop and MyPark. Blacktop is structured in the typical style of street basketball. MyPark consists of an open area filled with players who can join different games on different courts. Several games in the series feature a mode which allows the player to hold a slam dunk contest.

Several games in the series have featured game modes that are exclusive to that particular game. &quot;NBA 2K11&quot; featured the Jordan Challenge mode, in which players are tasked with recreating some of Michael Jordan&#x27;s most memorable feats, such as scoring 69 points in a single game. &quot;NBA 2K12&quot; featured the NBA&#x27;s Greatest mode, where the player can play with past NBA players, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, and Bill Russell. The PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows versions of &quot;NBA 2K14&quot; featured a mode titled Path to Greatness; similar to the Jordan Challenge mode, it focuses on the career of LeBron James.

==Reception==
The &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series has achieved consistent critical and commercial success. Elements of the series that are frequently praised include its presentation, specifically its commentary, attention to detail, and soundtrack, its abundance of content, its overall gameplay, and its consistency in terms of yearly releases without any drastic dips in quality. In recent years, the series has been seen by some critics as superior to other basketball games, specifically in comparison with EA Sports&#x27; &quot;NBA Live&quot; series.

Conversely, later installments have been criticized for their technical issues, particularly in regards to the online components; the introduction of microtransactions; and the quality of some of the more story-focused incarnations of the MyCareer mode. The series has also been criticized for the lack of innovations in several installments.

Specifically concerning sales, the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series has established itself as one of the better-selling video game franchises. A May 2014 earnings call reported that games in the series have sold over 17 million copies worldwide. A report in February 2017, however, suggested that games in the franchise have sold in excess of 68 million copies. According to one analyst, the most recent entries in the series average at least four million copies sold. The best-selling game in the series is &quot;NBA 2K14&quot;, which sold over seven million copies; it is also Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s best-selling sports game. &quot;NBA 2K16&quot; is the fastest-selling title in the series, shipping over four million copies within its first week of release. &quot;NBA 2K16&quot; sold over 10million units in 2017. As of December 2018, the series has sold over 90million units worldwide, making it the best-selling NBA video game series.

Games in the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series have been nominated for multiple awards, from events such as the Spike Video Game Awards, The Game Awards, and the D.I.C.E. Awards, usually related to being the best sports game of the year.

However, there are 2 games in the series that have been met with a mixed reception, such as &quot;NBA 2K21&quot; (current-gen only) and &quot;NBA 2K24&quot;.

==&quot;NBA 2K League&quot;==

In February 2017, the National Basketball Association, in conjunction with Take-Two Interactive, announced the creation of an esports league centering on the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; franchise. Known as the &quot;NBA 2K League&quot;, it commence competition in 2018. It was the first esports league to be operated by a North American professional sports league. The league is structured similarly to the NBA; teams are operated by NBA franchises and feature five professional esports players. The teams compete against each other in the current year&#x27;s &quot;NBA 2K&quot; game, and each member of a team only uses their in-game MyPlayer. The league features a regular season, as well as the playoffs and finals.

==Legal issues==
Two separate lawsuits have been filed against Take-Two related to their recreation of tattoos on NBA players recreated in the series. The first suit was filed by Solid Oak Sketches, filed in January 2016, after trying to seek a licensing agreement to use the registered copyrighted tattoos with Take-Two. LeBron James had submitted a statement supporting Take-Two, in that he asserted he has given the company the license use his image in their cases, which included his tattoos from Solid Oak Sketches, but this conclusion was thrown out by the judge. In March 2020, a federal District Court judge ruled that while the tattoos were copyrighted elements their use in the games were small enough to meet &quot;de minimis&quot; considerations, and that further, due to the nature of tattooing, an implicit license to use the tattoos was granted by the license granted for using the players&#x27; likeness. The judge summarily dismissed the case, as well as asserting that broadly, video games using licensed likenesses of players with their tattoos will be using the tattoo art within fair use. The defense of fair use was applicable to the defendants as the purpose of the tattoos in the game (to create a realistic depiction of the players) was satisfactorily transformative in comparison to their original purpose (as a form of self-expression through body art).

A separate lawsuit was filed by tattoo artist James Hayden in December 2017; Hayden asserted that Take-Two&#x27;s recreation of his tattoos designed for NBA players like LeBron James within &quot;NBA 2K16&quot; and onward were copyright infringements. Take-Two sought a summary judgement to close the case, but by March 2019, the preceding judge gave partial summary to Take-Two, but left the main question of copyright infringement open. Hayden has failed to register the copyrights until after &quot;NBA 2K16&quot; was released, leaving 2K17 and onward potentially liable to be determined in a court trial. One question raised by the judge was whether the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series was an ongoing game with annual updates, or if each release was considered a substantial new work, meaning that any copyright violation would apply repeatedly to all three post-2016 games in the series or as a singular violation.

<doc id="987156" wikidata="Q2657933" url="?curid=987156" title="Bonnacon">
<text>The bonnacon (also called bonasus or bonacho) () is a legendary creature described as a bull with inward-curving horns and a horse-like mane. 
Medieval bestiaries usually depict its fur as reddish-brown or black. Because its horns were useless for self-defense, the bonnacon was said to expel large amounts of caustic feces from its anus at its pursuers, burning them and thereby ensuring its escape.

==Term==
The term is derived from Greek βόνᾱσος (&quot;bonasos&quot;), meaning &quot;bison&quot;.

Strabo when describing the Zebu at the festivals in India, used the term bonasus.

==Textual history==
The first known description of the bonnacon comes from Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;:

The popularity of the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; in the Middle Ages led to the bonnacon&#x27;s inclusion in medieval bestiaries. In the tradition of the &quot;Physiologus&quot;, bestiaries often ascribed moral and scriptural lessons to the descriptions of animals, but the bonnacon gained no such symbolic meaning. Manuscript illustrations of the creature may have served as a source of humor, deriving as much from the reaction of the hunters as from the act of defecation. The Aberdeen Bestiary describes the creature using similar language to Pliny, though the beast&#x27;s location is moved from Paeonia to Asia:

The bonnacon is also mentioned in the life of Saint Martha in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, a 13th-century hagiographical work by Jacobus de Voragine. In the story, Saint Martha encounters and tames the Tarasque, a dragon-like legendary creature said to be the offspring of the biblical Leviathan and the bonnacon. In this account, the bonnacon (here: bonacho or onacho) is said to originate in Galatia.

<text>Hurricane Klaus was a minimal tropical cyclone that dropped heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within , the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing Tropical Storm Marco.

Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the impact Klaus had on Martinique, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.

==Meteorological history==

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about /h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name &quot;Klaus&quot;.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, Klaus was located in an area of of wind shear, although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of . Tracking through a highly baroclinic environment, the storm became better organized, and at 1200 UTC on October 5 Klaus attained hurricane status about east of Antigua; shortly thereafter, it passed east of Barbuda, its closest point of approach to the Lesser Antilles. Klaus reached peak winds of and a minimum central pressure of , though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear. At the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest. However, after weakening to a tropical storm on October 6, Klaus turned westward.

Klaus continued tracking just north of the Lesser Antilles, and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on October 8 to the north of Puerto Rico. Later that day, convection redeveloped over the center, and Klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast Bahamas; it briefly reached winds of . A low pressure area to its west over Cuba had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface, and on October 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming Marco, and Klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on October 9. The remnant moisture continued to the northwest, reaching the coast of South Carolina by October 11.

==Preparations==
Shortly after Klaus attained tropical storm status early on October 4, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands from Saint Martin to Antigua, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of France issued a tropical storm warning for Guadeloupe. A hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands, though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken. In Guadeloupe, officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in Martinique, Sint Maarten, and Antigua. The VC Bird International Airport was closed during the passage of the hurricane.

Later in its duration, the government of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern Bahamas, though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated.
Due to Hurricane Klaus, Space Shuttle Columbia&#x27;s launch was delayed.

==Impact==
Hurricane Klaus dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles, potentially as high as ; the hurricane affected many areas struck by Hurricane Hugo in the previous year. On Barbados, flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few families to move to safer areas; lightning from the outskirts of the storm left a portion of the island without power. High winds and rainfall affected the island of Saint Lucia, which destroyed about 15% of the nation&#x27;s banana crop for the year; damage totaled about $1 million (1990 USD).

The rainfall resulted in severe flooding on Martinique, which accrued to almost in some locations; two sisters drowned near Saint-Joseph after a bridge was washed away. Several landslides were reported on the island. The passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems. 750 people evacuated their homes in Le Lamentin due to flooding, and a total of 1,500 residents were left homeless on the island. Offshore, rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel, leaving its two passengers drifting on the boat for 25 days before being rescued about to the north-northwest of Martinique. In all, seven people were killed on the island.

On Dominica, winds from the hurricane damaged power lines and downed trees in the northern portion of the island. High winds on Antigua damaged a few roofs, and also downed communications from two radio networks. The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall on the United States Virgin Islands, reaching about on Saint Thomas; wind gusts peaked at on Saint Croix. Moderate rainfall continued into the Turks and Caicos Islands, with Grand Turk reporting a total of in 36 hours.

On the east coast of Florida, Klaus produced waves and tides of above normal. Beach erosion was reported along the east coast, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, it produced heavy rainfall between of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.

== Retirement ==

Due to the storm&#x27;s impacts on the islands of the Lesser Antilles, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Klaus&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists following the 1990 season. It was replaced with &quot;Kyle&quot; for the 1996 season.

<doc id="987165" wikidata="Q34200" url="?curid=987165" title="Yevanic language">
<text>Yevanic, also known as Judaeo-Greek, Romaniyot, Romaniote, and Yevanitika, is a Greek dialect formerly used by the Romaniotes and by the Constantinopolitan Karaites (in whose case the language is called Karaitika or Karaeo-Greek). The Romaniotes are a group of Greek Jews whose presence in the Levant is documented since the Byzantine period. Its linguistic lineage stems from the Jewish Koine spoken primarily by Hellenistic Jews throughout the region, and includes Hebrew and Aramaic elements. It was mutually intelligible with the Greek dialects of the Christian population. The Romaniotes used the Hebrew alphabet to write Greek and Yevanic texts. Judaeo-Greek has had in its history different spoken variants depending on different eras, geographical and sociocultural backgrounds. The oldest Modern Greek text was found in the Cairo Geniza and is actually a Jewish translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes (Kohelet).

==Origin of name==
The term &quot;Yevanic&quot; is an artificial creation from the Biblical word () referring to the Greeks and the lands that the Greeks inhabited. The term is an overextension of the Greek word (Ionia in English) from the (then) easternmost Greeks to all Greeks. The word for Greece in Hebrew is ; likewise, the word is used to refer to the Greek language in Hebrew.

==Geographical distribution==
A small number of Romaniote Jews in the United States, Israel, Greece, and Turkey have some knowledge of the Judaeo-Greek language. The language is highly endangered and could completely die out. There are no preservation programs to promote or to revive the language, but starting in April, 2022, the Oxford School for Rare Jewish languages will be offering a beginner&#x27;s course. In 1987, there were 35 speakers left in Israel, the majority located in Jerusalem. This population may have died out.

, a few elderly Jews in Ioannina, Greece still speak the language.

As of 2021 there is a small population of speakers in Iran.

==Historical background==
Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor, Southern Italy, the Balkans and Eastern Europe had originally a Greek-speaking Jewish community. After the arrival of Jewish refugees into these areas from the Iberian Peninsula, Northern Italy, and Western Europe, the Greek-speaking Jewish communities began to almost disappear while integrating into the group of the newcomers, which did not constitute in every area of their new homeland the majority.

The immigration of Italian and Spanish-speaking people into Greece in the late 15th century altered the culture and vernacular of the Greek Jews. A lot of locales picked up on Judeo-Spanish language and customs, however some communities in Epirus, Thessaly, the Ionian Islands, Crete, Constantinople and Asia Minor kept the old, so-called &quot;Romaniote minhag&quot; and the Judaeo-Greek language. During the 19th century Yevanic switched from Hebrew to letters to Greek letters. By the early 20th century, the Jews living in places such as Ioannina, Arta, Preveza, and Chalkida still spoke a form of Greek that slightly differentiated the Greek of their Christian neighbors. These differences, semantically, do not go beyond phonetic, intonational, and lexical phenomena. It is different from other Jewish languages, in that there is no knowledge of any language fragmentation ever taking place.

At the start of World War II Northern Greece alone had ten thousand speakers, but the language was almost totally annihilated during the Holocaust with only 149 speakers surviving.

== Features ==
Yevanic is based on Greek, but it contains large amounts of influence from Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic. It also used a different alphabet than Greek using Hebrew letters instead of Greek letters. The languages also has loan translations from Ladino.

==Current status==

The assimilation of the Romaniote communities by the Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, the emigration of many of the Romaniotes to the United States and Israel, and the murder of many of the Romaniotes during the Holocaust have been the main reasons of the decline of Judaeo-Greek. The survivors were too scant to continue an environment in which this language was dominant and more recent generations of the survivors have moved to new locations such as Greece, Israel, and the United States and now speak the respective languages of those countries; Standard Modern Greek, Hebrew, and English. 

The Jews have a place of note in the history of Modern Greek. They were unaffected by Atticism and employed the current colloquial vernacular which they then transcribed in Hebrew letters. The Romaniotes were Jews settled in the Eastern Roman Empire long before its division from its Western counterpart, and they were linguistically assimilated long before leaving the Levant after Hadrian&#x27;s decree against them and their religion. As a consequence, they spoke Greek, the language of the overwhelming majority of the populace in the beginning of the Byzantine era and that of the Greek élite thereafter, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Some communities in Northern Greece and Crete maintained their specific Romaniote practices since these communities were either geographically apart from the Sephardim or had different synagogues, and because their liturgies differed greatly. At the end of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika.

Yevanic has some samples on the internet but it lacks translations or spell checking, unlike larger more established languages.

==Literature==
There is a small amount of literature in Yevanic dating from the early part of the modern period, the most extensive document being a translation of the Pentateuch. A polyglot edition of the Bible published in Constantinople in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) translation on one side and a Yevanic translation on the other.
In its context, this exceptional cultivation of the vernacular has its analogue in the choice of Hellenistic Greek by the translators of the Septuagint and in the New Testament.

<text>The province of Como (; Comasco: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. It borders the Swiss cantons of Ticino and Grigioni to the north, the Italian provinces of Sondrio and Lecco to the East, the province of Monza and Brianza to the south and the province of Varese to the West. The city of Como is its capital—other large towns, with more than 10,000 inhabitants, include Cantù, Erba, Mariano Comense and Olgiate Comasco. Campione d&#x27;Italia also belongs to the province and is enclaved in the Swiss canton of Ticino. The Lugano Prealps cover the territory of the province, and the most important body of water is the glacial Lake Como.

<text>The torrent duck (Merganetta armata) is a member of the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae. It is the only member of the genus Merganetta. It is placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae after the &quot;perching duck&quot; assemblage to which it was formerly assigned was dissolved because it turned out to be paraphyletic.

This long species is a resident breeder in the Andes of South America, nesting in small waterside caves and other sheltered spots. Like the blue duck, it holds territories on fast-flowing mountain rivers, usually above . It is a powerful swimmer and diver even in white water but is reluctant to fly more than short distances. It is not particularly wary when located.

Male torrent ducks have a striking black and white head and neck pattern and a red bill. In-flight, they show dark wings with green speculum. Females of all subspecies are smaller than the drakes; they have orange underparts and throat, with the head and upperparts grey and a yellower bill. Juveniles are pale grey above and whitish below.

The male&#x27;s call is a shrill whistle, while the female&#x27;s is a throatier whistle.

This is a declining species due to competition for its invertebrate food from introduced trout, pollution, forest destruction, and damming of mountain rivers for hydroelectric schemes. The Chilean population seems relatively stable, while the more northern ones are more seriously affected. However, the overall population is still large enough to warrant classification as a Species of Least Concern in the IUCN Redlist.

== Subspecies ==
The subspecies taxonomy can be confusing. Males of the southern nominate subspecies &quot;M. a. armata&quot;, the Chilean torrent duck, have grey back and blackish underparts, with a chestnut belly. Males of the slightly smaller northern subspecies, the Colombian torrent duck, &quot;M. a. colombiana&quot;, are paler underneath, with streaked grey-brown underparts. Males of a third subspecies, the Peruvian torrent duck, &quot;M. a. leucogenis&quot;, are intermediate but very variable in plumage; some have entirely black underparts (&quot;turneri&quot; morph). Only males of the Chilean torrent duck have a black &#x27;teardrop&#x27; mark beneath the eye. The Peruvian torrent duck is sometimes split into 4 subspecies (&quot;leucogenis&quot;, &quot;turneri&quot;, &quot;garleppi&quot; and &quot;berlepschi&quot;), but these are more likely simply color variations, as they are not limited to distinct areas.
