<text>The Constitutional Movement was a right wing political group in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1979 by Andrew Fountaine as the National Front Constitutional Movement, a splinter group from the National Front. Offering a more moderate alternative to the NF, the Constitutional Movement claimed to have 2,000 members by 1980.

==Formation==
Within the National Front in the late 1970s there was a growing disaffection with the leadership of John Tyndall and his associate Martin Webster and in particular their adherence to neo-Nazi principles rather than what the critics believed to be the vote-winning alternative of a more populist British nationalism. Already by 1978, Fountaine had become the focal point for a number of members of the anti-Tyndall faction and their position was strengthened by the 1979 general election in which the NF put forward the greatest number of candidates in its history but failed to make any headway with the electorate.

The party was born at a time of serious division in the British far right and competed with a number of other parties for attention. Such was the confusion at the time that party operations were even based at Excalibur House (London, EC2), which continued to be the HQ of the main NF. Fountaine had split from the NF in opposition to what he claimed was the increasing Nazism amongst the leadership, the encouragement of links with violent subcultures such as football hooliganism and Nazi skinheads as well as a strong current of homosexuality which he claimed existed amongst the leadership. The new party ambitiously launched itself as an alternative to the Conservative Party and hoped to win votes and members from the right-wing of the Tories. Like the British Democratic Party, which broke away from the NF at the same time, it sought to distance itself from the vote-losing open Nazism that both groups associated with Tyndall, Webster and the other leaders of the NF. The Movement produced its own newspaper, &quot;Frontline News&quot; as well as a magazine &quot;Excalibur&quot;, the latter edited by Terry Savage, a veteran of the National Labour Party.

==Development==
The party campaigned for the 1981 Greater London Council election although the results proved disappointing and during the course of the campaign its Excalibur House HQ was damaged by a fire and a campaigner, Anthony Donnelly, was murdered in Hackney. Following this disastrous election, Fountaine announced his retirement from politics, leaving the Constitutional Movement without a strong leader.

The failure of this campaign, in which the party lost out to both the original NF and the New National Front, saw the party go into decline. Not long after this the party was contacted by Tyndall, Ray Hill and Charles Parker as part of their Committee for Nationalist Unity initiative in which they were aiming to forge a united far-right group from the NNF, Hill&#x27;s wing of the British Movement and other groups such as the Constitutional Movement. Although the group did not join this initiative it lost Robin May, its main organiser in the East End of London, to Tyndall&#x27;s group. A number of party members followed May and joined him in attending the March 1982 meeting at the Charing Cross Hotel in which Tyndall, Parker, Hill, Kenneth McKilliam and John Peacock announced the conversion of the Committee for Nationalist Unity into the British National Party.

==Disappearance==
The Constitutional Movement changed its name to the Nationalist Party soon after the formation of the BNP and under this title it contested five seats in the 1983 general election. It performed very poorly and the next time the party hit the headlines was when a former member, Richard Franklin, was revealed as a Conservative candidate in local elections in 1983.

The Nationalist Party made its last appearance in a 1984 by-election in the Southgate constituency, with James Kershaw polling only 80 votes in a seat won by Michael Portillo. The party was gone soon after this, with most of the members joining the British National Party.

<text>The M1 helmet is a combat helmet that was used by the United States Armed Forces from 1941 to 1986. Designed to replace the M1917 helmet, a British design used during World War I, the M1 helmet is known for having been used as the primary American combat headgear during World War II, with similarly extensive use in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Owing to its extensive use throughout World War II and the Cold War, the M1 helmet has become an icon of the U.S. military, with its design inspiring copies and derivative designs used by other militaries around the world.

In 1986, the M1 helmet, by then greatly outdated for the changing needs of modern warfare, was succeeded in U.S. military service by the PASGT helmet, another similarly iconic and influential combat helmet design. Some M1 helmets and their derivatives remain in service with several national militaries in the 21st century, although most have been relegated to being part of certain ceremonial uniforms, such as those of honor guards.

== History ==
=== Development ===
At the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, the U.S. military did not have a combat helmet; initially, American Expeditionary Forces personnel were issued British Mk l helmets, while those integrated with French units were issued French M15 Adrian helmets. American production quickly began of an American variant of the Mk I, the M1917 helmet, with some 2,700,000 units produced by the end of the war. At that point, the shortcomings of the M1917, which lacked balance and protection of the head from lateral fire, resulted in a project to produce a better helmet which would also have a distinctively American appearance.

Between 1919 and 1920, a number of new designs of helmets were tested by the Infantry Board in comparative trials along with the M1917 and helmets of other armies. One of those designs, the Helmet Model Number 5A, was selected for further study. This was an improved version of the Helmet Model Number 5, developed in 1917 and 1918 by Bashford Dean, the curator of arms and armor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had been rejected during the war because of its supposed resemblance to the German &quot;Stahlhelm&quot;. Eventually, tests held at Fort Benning between 1924 and 1926 showed that although the Helmet Model Number 5A offered better side protection than the M1917, it was more easily penetrated from above, and in some circumstances the shape of the helmet could interfere with properly holding and firing a rifle. Further ballistic tests at the Aberdeen Proving Ground resulted in the decision to retain the M1917 in 1934, which was then given a redesigned leather cradle and designated the M1917A1 or &quot;Kelly&quot; helmet.

In 1940, with World War II raging in Europe and Asia for a year and the United Kingdom seeking help from North America, it seemed increasingly likely that the United States would be dragged out of non-interventionism and into another war. The Infantry Board resurrected the quest to find a better type of helmet, since the ongoing conflict had shown that the M1917, designed to protect men standing in trenches from falling shell splinters and shrapnel, would be inadequate on the modern battlefield. The board reported:

Accordingly, the board, under the direction of Brigadier General Courtney Hodges, took the M1917 shell as the basis of the new prototype, trimmed off the brim, and added a visor and skirt-like extensions to protect the back and sides of the wearer&#x27;s head. Rejecting the conventional systems of cradles, the new helmet was given a Riddell type liner and suspension system, based on the contemporary style of football helmet, with an adjustable strap for the nape of the neck to prevent the helmet from rocking. The resulting prototype was designated the TS-3, and the McCord Radiator Company manufactured the first examples from Hadfield steel. In tests, they were found to be able to resist a .45 ACP pistol bullet fired at point-blank range, exceeding the initial specification. The TS-3 was given official approval on June 6, 1941 and was designated &quot;Helmet, Steel, M1&quot;. Full-scale production commenced almost immediately.

===Service===
Over 22 million U.S. M1 helmets were manufactured through September 1945. Production was done by the McCord Radiator and Manufacturing Company and the Schlueter Manufacturing Company; the former developed a method to create an almost eighteen-centimeter-deep bowl in a single pressing, which was considered an engineering milestone at the time.

In 1942, the helmet bails were changed from a fixed, welded version to a swivel model along with slight alterations to the shaping of the side brim, while in 1944, the stainless steel helmet rim with a seam at the front was replaced by a manganese steel rim with a rear seam. Further M1 helmets were manufactured for the Korean War.

Following World War II, the M1 helmet was widely adopted or copied by numerous other countries and its distinctive shape was adopted as the NATO standard. Postwar analyses of wartime casualty figures by the U.S. Army Operations Research Office found that 54 percent of hits to the M1 helmet failed to penetrate, and estimated that 70,000 men had been saved from death or injury by wearing it.

Production continued during the Cold War era with periodic improvements; in 1955 a grommet in the front of the liner was deleted, in 1964 the liner construction was changed to laminated nylon, and in 1975 a new chinstrap design was introduced. The final contract for U.S. M1 helmets was placed in 1976. The M1 was phased out of U.S. military service during the 1980s in favor of the PASGT helmet, which offered increased ergonomics and ballistic protection.

== Design ==
The M1 is a combination of two &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; helmets—an outer metal shell, sometimes called the &quot;steel pot&quot;, and a hard hat–type liner nestled inside it featuring an adjustable suspension system. Helmet covers and netting would be applied by covering the steel shell with the extra material tucked inside the shell and secured by inserting the liner.

The outer shell should not be worn by itself. The liner can be worn by itself, providing protection similar to a hard hat, and was often worn in such fashion by military policemen, Assistant Drill Instructors (known as AIs), and rifle/machine gun/pistol range staff, although they were supposed to wear steel at the range. The liner is sometimes worn in U.S. military ceremonies and parades, painted white or chromed. The depth of the helmet is , the width is , and length is , the steel shell thickness is 0.044&quot; (1.12 mm), The weight of a World War II-era M1 is approximately , including the liner and chinstrap.

=== Shell ===
The non-magnetic Hadfield manganese steel for M1 helmet shells was smelted at the Carnegie Steel Company or the Sharon Steel Company of Pennsylvania. After being poured into fifteen-ton ingots (also called &quot;heats&quot;), the steel was divided into 216-inch by 36-inch by 4-inch blocks, known as &quot;lifts,&quot; which were then cut into three equal 72-inch pieces to make them easier to handle. The cut lifts were sent to the Gary Works in Gary, Indiana for further processing, after which they were each reduced into 250 68-inch by 36-inch by 0.044-inch sheets, which were cut into 16.5-inch circles. The helmet discs were oiled and banded into lots of 400 for delivery by rail to McCord or Schlueter for pressing and final assembly.

Each &quot;heat&quot; of steel was assigned a unique number by the smelter, as was each of its &quot;lifts&quot;. When each new heat was unloaded at McCord or Schlueter, it was assigned a sequential number, and each lift within the heat was assigned a letter of the alphabet (for example, the third lift unloaded of the forty-ninth heat received by McCord would be 49C). This unique &quot;lot and lift&quot; number was stamped onto each helmet produced from the discs of a particular lift, and allowed for traceability in case the helmets exhibited defects. The &quot;lot and lift&quot; number is in reference to the time when the fabricator received the helmet discs, not when they were made into finished helmets. Lifts of heats were not loaded onto or unloaded from railcars in any particular order, and were often warehoused (also in no particular order) before being finished.

The helmet discs were drawn to a depth of seven inches to create the rough helmet shape, or &quot;shell,&quot; and the edges were trimmed. The edge of the shell has a crimped metal rim running around it, which provides a smooth edge. This is usually known as the &quot;rim&quot;. The rim has a seam where the ends of the strip meet. On the earliest shells the seam met at the front. This was moved to the back of the rim in November 1944 At this time, the rim also went from being made of stainless steel to manganese steel. On each side of the shell, there are stainless steel loops for the chinstrap. Early-war production shells had fixed rectangular loops, and mid-war to 1960s helmets feature movable rectangular loops; this feature was adopted in 1943 to address the problem that when earlier helmets were dropped, the fixed loops were more susceptible to breaking off. Early shells for paratrooper helmets feature fixed, D-shaped loops. The shells were then painted with flat Olive Drab shade 319 (1941-1966) or Munsell Y10 green paint (1966 onward), with the paint on the outside of the shell sprinkled with either finely ground cork (World War II era) or silica sand (postwar).
World War II-production helmets feature sewn-on cotton web olive drab shade 3 chinstraps, replaced gradually throughout 1943 and 1944 with olive drab shade 7 chinstraps. 1950s and later production chinstraps are made of olive drab webbing attached to the loops with removable metal clips. Nylon chinstraps were introduced in the U.S. military in 1975. These straps featured a two-piece web chin cup and were fastened by a metal snap rather than buckle.

Many soldiers wore the webbing chinstraps unfastened or looped around the back of the helmet and clipped together. This practice arose for two reasons: First, because hand-to-hand combat was anticipated, and an enemy could be expected to attack from behind, reach over the helmet, grab its visor, and pull. If the chinstrap were worn, the head would be snapped back, causing the victim to lose balance, and leave the throat and stomach exposed to a knife thrust. Secondly, many men incorrectly believed that a nearby exploding bomb or artillery shell could cause the chinstrap to break their neck when the helmet was caught in its concussive force, although a replacement buckle, the T1 pressure-release buckle, was manufactured that allowed the chinstrap to release automatically should this occur. In place of the chinstrap, the nape strap inside the liner was counted on to provide sufficient contact to keep the helmet from easily falling off the wearer&#x27;s head.

The design of the bowl-like shell led to some novel uses: When separated from the liner, the shell could be used as an entrenching tool, hammer, washbasin, bucket, bowl, or seat. The shell was also used as a cooking pot, but the practice was discouraged as it would make the metal alloy brittle.

=== Liner ===
The liner is a hard hat-like support for the suspension, and is designed to fit snugly inside the steel shell.

The first liners were produced in June 1941 and designed by Hawley Products Company. The suspension was initially made from strips of silver rayon webbing stretched around and across the inside of the liner. A sweatband is clipped onto these, and is adjusted to fit around the head of the wearer. Three triangular bands of rayon meet at the top of the helmet, where they were adjusted by a shoestring to fit the height and shape of the wearer&#x27;s head. A snap-on nape strap cushioned the liner against the back of the wearer&#x27;s neck and stops it from falling off. As the rayon had a tendency to stretch and not recover its shape, the suspension material was later changed to olive drab number 3, and then olive drab number 7, herringbone twill cotton webbing.

World War II and Korean War-era liners have their own chinstrap made from brown leather. The liner chinstrap does not have loops like the shell; it was either riveted directly to the inside of the liner (early examples) or snapped onto studs. It can still swivel inside the liner. The chinstrap is usually seen looped over the brim of the shell, and helps to keep it in place when its own chinstraps are not in use.

Early liners were made from a mix of compressed paper fibers impregnated with phenolic resin, with olive drab cotton twill fabric stretched over the outside. They were discontinued in November 1942 because they degraded quickly in high heat and high humidity environments. They were replaced by evolving plastic liners, using a process developed by the Inland Division of General Motors. These liners were made of strips of cotton cloth bathed in phenolic resin and draped in a star shape over a liner-shaped mold, where they were subjected to pressure to form a liner. The initial &quot;low pressure&quot; process was deemed unacceptable by the Army, but accepted out of need. These liners were made by St. Clair Manufacturing and Hood Rubber Company. Hawley, Hood, and St. Clair&#x27;s contracts were cancelled by early 1944, when a &quot;high pressure&quot; process which produced better-quality liners became commercially viable. Companies which produced &quot;high pressure&quot; liners during World War II included Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, CAPAC Manufacturing, Inland (whose molds were acquired by Firestone after their contract was cancelled), Mine Safety Appliances Company, Seaman Paper Company, and International Molded Plastics, Inc.

Liners essentially identical in construction to &quot;high pressure&quot; World War II examples were produced between 1951 and 1954 during the Korean War by the Micarta Division of Westinghouse and CAPAC Manufacturing. In the 1960s, the M1 helmet liner was redesigned, eliminating the leather chinstrap, nape strap, and changing the suspension webbing to a pattern resembling an asterisk in a coarse cotton web material in lieu of the earlier cotton herringbone twill. In the early 1970s, suspension materials changed to a thicker, more flexible nylon with a rougher unbeveled rim. Later changes included a move to a yellow and green material for liner construction.

M1 helmet liners intended for use by paratroopers had a different construction. The short piece of webbing which held the nape strap at the back of the wearer&#x27;s neck was extended around the sides of the liner, and terminated on each side in A-shaped yokes which hung down below the rim of the liner and had buckles for an adjustable chin cup made of molded leather. Two female snaps on the inside of the liner above the &quot;A&quot; yokes accepted male snaps on each of the steel shell&#x27;s chinstraps, and helped to keep the liner inside the steel shell during abrupt or violent movements.

== Accessories ==

In late 1942, the United States Marine Corps used a cloth helmet cover with a camouflage pattern for its helmets. The cover was made from cotton herringbone twill fabric. It had a &quot;forest green&quot; pattern on one side and a &quot;brown coral island&quot; pattern on the other.

The U.S. Army often used nets to reduce the helmets&#x27; shine when wet and to allow burlap scrim or vegetation to be added for camouflage purposes. Most nets were acquired from British or Canadian Army stocks or cut from larger camouflage nets. The Army did not adopt an official issue net until the &quot;Net, Helmet, with Band&quot; that included an elastic neoprene band to keep it in place.

After World War II, no new covers were issued. At the start of the Korean War in 1950, many soldiers had to improvise covers from burlap sandbags or parachute fabric. A consignment of 100,000 olive drab covers was dispatched to the theater, but the ship carrying them, SS &quot;Jacob Luckenbach&quot;, sank in a collision en route and they were all lost. In 1963, the Army and Marine Corps adopted a reversible fabric cover called the &quot;Mitchel Pattern&quot;, with a leafy green pattern on one side and orange and brown cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent during the Vietnam War, where, for the first time, the Army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; in Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) Woodland camouflage were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam jungle pattern camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was only printed on one side and was not reversible, though some rare desert camouflage examples exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet&#x27;s shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.

Other armies used these or similar covers printed with different camouflage patterns, or employed entirely different methods. In the Dutch Army, for example, it was common practice to use a square piece of burlap as a helmet cover on M1 helmets, usually secured by a net and a wide rubber band.

During the Battle of the Bulge and the Korean War, soldiers made white helmet covers as camouflage in snowy areas. They were not issued to soldiers, so many soldiers simply made them using white cloth from a shirt or tablecloth.

== Variants ==
;M1
:Standard model introduced in 1941 and issued until 1986. Different alterations were made to the M1&#x27;s design at various stages of World War II, as well as during the Korean War and Vietnam War, but in general the M1 is the standard helmet of this type.
;M2
:Paratrooper variant introduced in January 1942. The main difference between it and the M1 is its D-shaped spot welded bales, as opposed to the M1&#x27;s rectangular chinstrap bales. The chinstrap of the M2 also has a button snap on the end that allows it to be fastened to the liner. Otherwise, it is identical to the M1.
;M1C
:Improved version of the M2 helmet introduced in January 1945, replacing the M2 as the primary American paratrooper helmet until 1986. The primary difference with the M1C is its four-point &quot;A-yoke&quot; chinstrap with a leather chin cup, designed to support the head and neck and prevent adverse movement during jumps. It uses a belt loop-type connection to secure the chinstrap to the A-yokes, which can be opened or closed from either side and partially removed without tools. Otherwise, the M1C, like the M2, is nearly indistinguishable from the M1.
;M3
:&quot;Flak&quot; variant introduced in December 1943. The M3 was designed for United States Army Air Forces bomber crews due to their disdain for the M1, which was uncomfortable with headphones, too large to wear in ball turrets, and offered inadequate protection to the head against debris and bumps. Based on M1 helmet modifications first made by the 306th Bombardment Group in January 1943, the M3 helmet&#x27;s most distinctive feature is its hinged steel ear covers lined with felt that protected against anti-aircraft flak and made the helmet compatible with headsets. The shell itself is lined with flocking to prevent the steel from freezing and ensure skin would not stick to it at high altitudes.
;M5
:Improved version of the M3 flak helmet introduced in February 1945. The M5 lacks the distinct swept brim of the other M1 variants and has deeper form-fitting ear covers. Another unique feature is the chinstraps being clipped to the swivel bails, which eventually became standard on postwar M1s. Some elements were taken from the Grow helmet, which was introduced for American aircrews in December 1943 as the M4 helmet.

In 1958, the M-62 was remade as a one-piece helmet and renamed the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; M1A1, produced in three sizes: 66, 68, and 71. The M1A1 was issued until 1981, when a modified version was released and renamed the &quot;Helm1A1&quot;; modifications included a three-point chin strap with the third point connecting at the nape, extra large sizes, and a further adjustable liner. Use seemingly ended after German reunification in the 1990s.

<text>Radio Berlin International was the international broadcasting arm for the German Democratic Republic&#x27;s (GDR) Rundfunk der DDR (Radio of the GDR) broadcasting service. Radio Berlin International (RBI) was one of the major international broadcasters of the Cold War era.

==History==
Radio Berlin International was founded in May 1959 to counter the influence of the newly-formed Deutsche Welle, the West German international broadcaster. Much the RBI&#x27;s media output was focused on propagandized news reports and information about the GDR. RBI offered a state-sponsored view on life in a socialist country to nations around the world. The purpose of RBI&#x27;s mission was two-fold. In accordance with state prerogatives, RBI was charged with spreading Marxist-Leninist ideology around the globe. In addition, RBI&#x27;s broadcasts sought to establish international recognition of East Germany as a legitimate state by distributing large quantities of colorful and professionally-produced publicity material about life in the GDR to its listeners across the world. As a result of its international focus, RBI&#x27;s content schedule was flexible, often changing depending on which world events offered the greatest returns for socialist propaganda.

Due to the international, multilingual nature of their broadcasting, RBI staff were able to more freely discuss prohibited content because their superiors were rarely able to understand foreign languages such as Swahili and Arabic, for example. From 1955 to 1975, RBI broadcast in 17 different languages, the most popular of which were English, French, and Arabic. By 1976 RBI was producing 338 hours of weekly content for an international audience. Of these 338 hours, Western and Eastern Europe consumed 175 hours of airtime, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa with 79 hours, North Africa and the Middle East taking up 53 hours, Latin America with 46 hours, and North America and East Asia both assuming 26 hours each.

RBI broadcasting initially used 50-kilowatt transmitters located at Leipzig, Königs-Wusterhausen, and Nauen. In 1964, RBI&#x27;s system at Nauen built by the state enterprises VEB Funkwerk Berlin Köpenick and VEB Industrieprojekte featured rotatable, tiltable antennas under remote control and able to handle 200 KW of power, making RBI the second most powerful shortwave service in the Soviet bloc. From 1971-1981, the Nauen station was further upgraded with 500-kilowatt antenna imported from the Swiss company Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. The studios were based in a former furniture factory at Nalepastraße in East Berlin, next to the river Spree.

RBI continued to operate during the period between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and German reunification on October 3, 1990. During this time, with a newly-obsolete state agenda, RBI&#x27;s editors and staff were free to critique the now-defunct GDR, albeit still from an East German perspective. RBI aired its final broadcast on October 2, 1990, one day before German reunification formally dissolved the GDR by accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The final broadcast was noted for the bitterness among RBI staff, some of whom resented its &quot;takeover&quot;, rather than &quot;unification,&quot; with Deutsche Welle. The last words (for the last English broadcast, at 36:48 of the reference) were by Robert Mitchell, &quot;Take care and good luck&quot;, followed by The Doors&#x27; &quot;The End&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; (K696) was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II. The ship was completed at the end of 1944 and was assigned to the 7th Escort Group at the beginning of 1945. While escorting her first and only Arctic convoy to Russia, she claimed to have shot down a German torpedo bomber. &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; was torpedoed in early 1945 by the , with the loss of 11 men, near the Soviet coast. The ship was beached in an effort to save her, but she was pulled off by the ebbing tide and capsized. Her wreck was declared a total loss.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding , enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The Castles carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Denbigh Castle&quot;, the only ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 19 December 1942 and laid down by John Lewis &amp; Sons at their shipyard in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 30 September 1943. The ship was launched on 5 August 1944 and completed on 30 December 1944. She arrived at Tobermory, Mull, Scotland, on 12 January 1945 to begin training at the Royal Navy&#x27;s Anti-Submarine Training School, . Having completed training, &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; arrived at Scapa Flow on 29 January to join the 7th Escort Group.

Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Graham Butcher, the ship escorted Convoy JW 64 to Murmansk at the beginning of February. On the 7th, &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; claimed to have shot down a German torpedo bomber. Almost a week later, the ship was torpedoed by &quot;U-992&quot; as the convoy entered the Kola Inlet at 00:13 on 13 February; the corvette&#x27;s radar had picked up the submarine at a range of , but had not identified her due to the confused radar returns and darkness. The torpedo struck the bow and the crew thought that the ship had struck a mine. The explosion killed eleven ratings and threw the four-inch gun onto the Squid platform behind it. The remaining bow structure sagged downwards, although &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; was in no danger of sinking. The destroyer transferred her medical officer over and the corvette came alongside around 00:45 to receive casualties, and Butcher ordered as many ratings aboard her as he thought he could spare. &quot;Bluebell&quot; began towing &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; at 02:05 and reached a maximum speed of , &quot;Serapis&quot; screening the ships during the tow.

The came alongside at 04:30 to transfer a salvage pump as the corvette was still taking on water. At 05:01, Butcher ordered all remaining hands aboard the Soviet ship because &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; was slowly sinking by the bow, only the officers remaining aboard. &quot;Buresvestnik&quot;″s captain, not wanting the corvette to founder in the channel, took over the tow at 06:15, by which time her stern was nearly out of the water. &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; was beached at 07:30 at Bolshaya Volokovaya Bay near Vaenga; &quot;Buresvestnik&quot; then pushed her stern around. The ship began to slowly list with the ebbing tide and the officers abandoned her at 09:05; five minutes later she capsized and slid into deeper water. The intense cold made later efforts to retrieve or destroy secret documents and equipment still aboard extremely difficult, but the diving team from the light cruiser did manage to demolish the radar office. In recognition of her service, &quot;Denbigh Castle&quot; was awarded the battle honour Arctic 1945.

==History==
She was built by Smiths Dock Company at South Bank, North Yorkshire, launched on 17 August 1943, and commissioned on 14 November 1943.

In World War II, she served as a convoy escort and took part in the sinking of two U-boats:
* was sunk by , , , , , and &quot;Kenilworth Castle&quot; on 6 March 1944
* was sunk south of Ireland by , , and &quot;Kenilworth Castle&quot; on 11 November 1944 – all in the 30th Escort Group under Commander Denys Rayner.

&quot;Kenilworth Castle&quot; was scrapped at Llanelli in June 1956. Her bell was given to The Bugle Inn, Yarmouth, Isle of Wight.

<text>HMS &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; (K397) was a of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy, named after Launceston Castle in Cornwall. The ship was constructed during the Second World War and saw service primarily as a convoy escort.

==Design==
The s were an improved and enlarged derivative of the earlier s, which was intended to be built by shipyards that could not build the larger and more capable frigates. The greater length of the Castles gave made them better seaboats than the Flowers, which were not originally designed for ocean escort work. Large numbers (96 in total) were ordered in late 1942 and early 1943 from shipyards in the United Kingdom and Canada, but Allied successes in the Battle of the Atlantic meant that the requirement for escorts was reduced, and many ships (including all the Canadian ones) were cancelled.

The Castles were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was aft at full load. Displacement was about standard and full load. Two Admiralty Three-drum water tube boilers fed steam to a vertical triple expansion engine rated at which drove a single propeller shaft. This gave a speed of . 480 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at .

The ships had a main gun armament of a single QF 4-inch Mk XIX dual-purpose gun, backed up by two twin and two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Anti-submarine armament consisted of a single triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 depth charges backed up by two depth charge throwers and a single depth charge rail, with 15 depth charges carried. Type 272 or Type 277 surface search radar was fitted, as was high-frequency direction finding (HF/DF) gear. The ships&#x27; sonar outfit was Type 145 and Type 147B.

The small size and slow speed of the &quot;Castle&quot;s meant that they were considered obsolete post-war, and they underwent limited modifications, with armament changes limited to replacing the twin 20mm mounts with single 40 mm Bofors mounts. &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; had been modified to this standard by 1953.

==Service history==
&quot;Launceston Castle&quot; was ordered on 19 January 1943, one of 14 Castle-class corvettes ordered that day (of which three were cancelled and two completed as rescue ships). The ship was laid down at Blyth Shipbuilding&#x27;s Blyth, Northumberland shipyard as Yard number 295 on 27 May 1943, with the ship&#x27;s machinery being built by White&#x27;s Marine Engineering Company at Hebburn. &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; was launched on 27 November 1943 and completed on 20 June 1944, and was allocated the Pennant number K397. She was the first Royal Navy ship to be called &quot;Launceston Castle&quot;.

In the Second World War she carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches, the English Channel and the North Sea. After commissioning, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; joined Escort Group B4. In August 1944, Escort Group B4 was redesignated as the 30th Escort Group commanded by Denys Rayner, who carried his flag on board . On 11 November 1944, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot;, along with sister ships of the 30th Escort Group, &quot;Pevensey Castle&quot;, and , carried out a series of attacks against a sonar target with Squid and depth charges off the south of Ireland, bringing up oil and a large air bubble, and were credited with sinking the submarine, which was later identified as the . In 1999, however, the wreck of &quot;U-1200&quot; was found south-east of Start Point, Devon, with the cause of the submarine&#x27;s loss uncertain. The 30th Escort Group is now believed to have attacked a non-submarine target. On 15 November and 26–29 December, 30 Escort Group, including &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; made more attacks against suspected submarine targets.

&quot;Launceston Castle&quot; continued to serve with the 30th Escort Group for the rest of the war in Europe, but in July–October 1945, was employed on air-sea rescue duties operating out of Freetown, patrolling on the expected routes of flights repatriating American troops. In 1947, the ship went into reserve at Devonport. In 1948, the Castle-class were redesignated from &#x27;Corvettes&#x27; to &#x27;Frigates (2nd Rate)&#x27;, and so &quot;Launceston Castle&quot;″s pennant number changed from K397 to F397. The frigate was refitted at Bristol in 1949.

In October 1951, after a refit at Falmouth, Cornwall, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; joined the 2nd Training Squadron, serving as an Air Training Target Ship, working with helicopters carrying out air-sea rescue training, cooperating with anti submarine aircraft and acting as a target for submarines. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. After two Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft of the RAF went missing on 11 January off Fastnet Rock in the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; took part in search operations for the missing aircraft, while on 24 January that year she took part in search operations after a Fleet Air Arm Fairey Firefly ditched off Lands End. In November 1956, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; returned to reserve at Devonport. On the night on 5/6 February 1957, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; went to the assistance of the merchant ship &quot;Holdernore&quot;, which was adrift between Skerryvore and Tiree in the Inner Hebrides off the west coast of Scotland in gale force winds, escorting &quot;Holdernore&quot; to safety in Tobermory Bay.

In 1959, &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; was sold for scrap, arriving at J. A. White&#x27;s yard at St Davids on Forth for breaking up on 3 August 1959.

<doc id="988307" wikidata="Q3222569" url="?curid=988307" title="Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington">
<text>&quot;Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the fourteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 9, 2003. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Lance Kramer.

In this episode, the Simpsons&#x27; home becomes uninhabitable because of airplane noise. Krusty is elected to Congress and eventually has a bill passed to change the flight path. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
After their house is shaken by a tremendous rumble one morning, the Simpsons discover that they&#x27;re living directly beneath the newest flight path to Springfield International Airport, after Mayor Quimby has it redirected away from where he is entertaining his mistress. A complaint to an airport official has no effect, who tells them to go home and learn to live with it. Unable to sell the house because of the noise, Homer and Marge then go to their congressman Horace Wilcox, who has been Springfield&#x27;s representative since 1933. While Wilcox is eager to help, he is so upset by their misfortune that he suffers a heart attack and dies.

Bart asks Krusty the Clown to run for Congress and he agrees, thinking he can also eliminate everything with which the Government is harassing him. He is adopted as the Republican candidate. His campaign starts badly because he has offended so many minorities with his politically incorrect jokes, but Lisa helps him turn his campaign around by having him connect with regular families and citizens. With this advice and a very helpful Fox News programme, he is elected.

To Krusty&#x27;s chagrin, no-one pays attention to a freshman Congressman, and he is appointed to useless committees, or set to work cleaning the graffiti off the walls. He, and the Simpsons, are about to give up, but Walter Mondale, who is working as a janitor in Congress, explains to them how a bill really becomes a law. With his help, Bart blackmails a key congressman with a videotape that shows him abusing the free mail policy. Homer manages to get another congressman drunk (and himself as well). Finally, during a session in Congress, Mondale and Lisa, with Homer&#x27;s drunken diversion, fix the Air Traffic Bill with a paperclip to another bill giving orphans American flags. When the bill comes up for a vote, both the blackmailed congressman and the drunk one consent, and it is passed. Krusty praises the processes of democracy. At home, the Simpsons are happy to get the peace and quiet that they heroically fought for. Homer says that the planes are now flying where they belong — over the homes of poor people.

==Controversy==
At one point during the episode, the family is watching Krusty and his opponent debate on the Fox News Channel, which showed several headlines in its news ticker that parodied the right-leaning network&#x27;s political views. Among the headlines in the news ticker were &quot;Pointless news crawls up 37 percent,&quot; &quot;Do Democrats cause cancer? Find out at foxnews.com,&quot; &quot;Rupert Murdoch: Terrific dancer,&quot; &quot;Dow down 5,000 points,&quot; &quot;Study: 92 percent of Democrats are gay,&quot; &quot;JFK posthumously joins Republican Party,&quot; and &quot;Oil slicks found to keep seals young, supple.&quot; Several months after the episode originally aired, Matt Groening claimed that Fox News, the corporate sister to the Fox Broadcasting Company that airs the show, threatened to sue Groening, but opted against &quot;suing itself.&quot; Groening mentioned that while they got away with the joke, they were no longer allowed to parody news tickers on the show. Despite that, the show would still parody Fox News on several occasions afterward.

The Dow Jones &amp; Company, which owned the Dow Jones Industrial Average that was parodied in the news ticker, would be purchased by News Corporation in 2007 and would be a corporate sister to Fox until the 2013 split between the new News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, which was further split with the acquisition of the film and television assets of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company on March 19, 2019, with Fox News Channel now part of the Fox Corporation.

==Cultural references==
The episode title is a reference to the movie &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. The scene where Mayor Quimby, upon hearing his mistress speak for the first time, remarks that he &quot;regrets building her that opera house&quot; is a reference to Citizen Kane, where the title character opens an opera house for his mistress, despite her lack of vocal talent.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode was watched by 14.43 million viewers, which was the 11th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; thought the episode recycled plot points from previous episodes featuring elections and repeated a previously used joke. He wrote that &quot;[t]he show still delivers some laughs, but the repetitive moments harm it.&quot;

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando liked the writing by John Swartzwelder. They also thought the episode treated Republicans &quot;in a bad light&quot;, but they attributed that to the era in which the episode aired.

<text>798 Art Zone (), or Dashanzi Art District, is a complex of 50-year-old decommissioned military factory buildings boasting a unique architectural style that houses a thriving artistic community in Dashanzi, Chaoyang District, Beijing. The area is often called the 798 Art District or Factory 798 although technically, Factory #798 is only one of several structures inside the complex formerly known as 718 Joint Factory. The buildings are within alleys number 2 and 4 on Jiǔxiānqiáo Lù (酒仙桥路), south of the Dàshānziqiáo flyover (大山子桥). The area is anchored by the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, the largest and most visited venue in the area. In recent years, it has been the main venue for the annual Beijing Queer Film Festival and Beijing Design Week.

==Construction==

The Dashanzi factory complex began as an extension of the &quot;Socialist Unification Plan&quot; of military-industrial cooperation between the Soviet Union and the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of China. By 1951, 156 &quot;joint factory&quot; projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the Chinese government&#x27;s first Five-Year Plan. However, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time and suggested that the Chinese turn to East Germany where much of the Soviet Union&#x27;s electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier Zhou Enlai, scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was green-lighted in early 1952 and a Chinese preparatory group was sent to East Berlin to prepare design plans. This project, which was to be the largest by East Germany in China, was then informally known as Project #157.

The architectural plans were left to the Germans, who chose a functional Bauhaus-influenced design over the more ornamental Soviet style, triggering the first of many disputes between the German and Russian consultants on the project. The plans, where form follows function, called for large indoor spaces designed to let the maximum amount of natural light into the workplace. Arch-supported sections of the ceiling would curve upwards then fall diagonally along the high slanted banks or windows; this pattern would be repeated several times in the larger rooms, giving the roof its characteristic sawtooth-like appearance. Despite Beijing&#x27;s northern location, the windows were all to face north because the light from that direction would cast fewer shadows.

The chosen location was a 640,000 square meter area in Dashanzi, then a low-lying patch of farmland northeast of Beijing. The complex was to occupy 500,000 square meters, 370,000 of which were allocated to living quarters. It was officially named Joint Factory 718, following the Chinese government&#x27;s method of naming military factories starting with the number 7. Fully funded by the Chinese side, the initial budget was enormous for the times: 9 million Rbls or approximately 140 million RMB (US$17 million) at today&#x27;s rates; actual costs were 147 million RMB.

Ground was broken in April 1954. Construction was marked by disagreements between the Chinese, Soviet and German experts, which led at one point to a six-month postponement of the project. The Germans&#x27; harshest critic was the Russian technology consultant in charge of Beijing&#x27;s two Soviet-built electronics factories (714 and 738), who was also head consultant of the Radio Industrial Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The disputes generally revolved around the Germans&#x27; high but expensive quality standards for buildings and machines, which were called &quot;over-engineering&quot; by the Russians. Among such points of contention was the Germans&#x27; insistence, historical seismic data in hand, that the buildings be built to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale, whereas the Chinese and Russians wanted to settle for 7. Communications expert Wang Zheng, head of Communications Industry in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and supporter of the East German bid from the start, ruled in favor of the Germans for this particular factory.

At the height of the construction effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet Red Army&#x27;s tremendous drain on East Germany&#x27;s industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian railway, and a 15 km track of railroad between Beijing railway station and Dongjiao Station was built especially to service the factory. Caltech-educated scientist Luo Peilin (罗沛霖), formerly head of the preparatory group in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated perfectionist whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success.

==Operation==

Joint Factory 718 began production in 1957, amid a grandiose opening ceremony and display of Communist brotherhood between China and East Germany, attended by high officials of both countries. The first director was Li Rui (李瑞), who had been involved in the early negotiations in Berlin.

The factory quickly established a reputation for itself as one of the best in China. Through its several &quot;danwei&quot; or &quot;work units&quot;, it offered considerable social benefits to its 10,000-20,000 workers, especially considering the relative poverty of the country during such periods as the Great Leap Forward. The factory boasted, among others:

* the best housing available to workers in Beijing, providing fully furnished rooms to whole families for less than 1/30 of the workers&#x27; income;
* diverse extracurricular activities such as social and sporting events, dancing, swimming, and training classes;
* its own athletics, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams for men and women, ranked among the best in inter-factory competitions;
* a brigade of German-made motorcycles, performing races and stunt demonstrations;
* an orchestra that played not only revolutionary hymns but also German-influenced classical Western music;
* literary clubs and publications, and a library furnished with Chinese and foreign (German) books;
* Jiuxianqiao hospital, featuring German equipment and offering the most advanced dental facilities in China.

The factory even had its own volunteer military reserves or &quot;jinweishi&quot; (近卫师), which numbered hundreds and were equipped with large-scale weapons and anti-aircraft guns.

Workers&#x27; skills were honed by frequent personnel exchanges, internships and training in cooperation with East Germany. Different incentives kept motivation high, such as rewards systems and &quot;model worker&quot; distinctions. At the same time, political activities such as Maoism study workshops kept the workers in line with Chinese Communist Party doctrine. During the Cultural revolution, propaganda slogans for Mao Zedong Thought were painted on the ceiling arches in bright red characters (where they remain today at the latter tenants&#x27; request).

Frequent VIP visits contributed to the festive atmosphere. Notable guests included Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Kim Il-Sung.

The Joint Factory produced a wide variety of military and civilian equipment. Civilian production included acoustic equipment for Beijing&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Stadium and Great Hall of the People, as well as all the loudspeakers on Tiananmen Square and Chang&#x27;an Avenue. Military components were also exported to China&#x27;s Communist allies, and helped establish North Korea&#x27;s wireless electronics industry.
After 10 years of operation, Joint Factory 718 was split into more manageable components, such as sub-Factories 706, 707, 751, 761, 797 and 798. The first Head of sub-Factory 798 (the largest) was Branch Party Secretary Fu Ke (傅克), who played a major role in recruiting skilled workers from southern China and returned overseas Chinese.

However, the factory came under pressure during Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms of the 1980s. Deprived of governmental support like many state-owned enterprises, it underwent a gradual decline and was eventually rendered obsolete. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most sub-factories had ceased production, 60% of the workers had been laid off, and the remains of the management were reconstituted as part of a real-estate operation called &quot;Seven-Star Huadian Science and Technology Group&quot;, charged with overseeing the industrial park and finding tenants for the abandoned buildings.

==Artistic rebirth==
The Dashanzi factory complex was vacated at around the time when most of Beijing&#x27;s contemporary artist community was looking for a new home. Avant-garde art was frowned upon by the government and the community had traditionally existed on the fringes of the city. From 1984 to 1995, they worked in run-down houses near the Old Summer Palace in northwestern Beijing, until their eviction. Many then moved to the eastern Tong County (now Tongzhou District), more than an hour&#x27;s drive from the city center.

Then in 1995, Beijing&#x27;s Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), looking for storage and workshop space, set up in the now defunct Factory 706. The temporary move became permanent and in 2000 Sui Jianguo, Dean of the Department of Sculpture, located his own studio in the area. The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers milling about.

By 2003, an artistic community of over 30 artists, designers, and publishers had developed. The first creatives to take residence in the district included artist Xu Yong, designer artist Huang Rui, publisher Robert Bernell, painter Li Songsong, and Beijing Tokyo Art Projects&#x27; Tabata Yukihito.

One of the first exhibition spaces, Beijing Tokyo Art Projects (BTAP, 北京东京艺术工程), was opened by Tabata Yukihito of Japan&#x27;s Tokyo Gallery. Inside a 400-m2 division of Factory 798&#x27;s main area, this was the first renovated space featuring the high arched ceilings that would become synonymous with the Art District. BTAP&#x27;s 2002 opening exhibition &quot;Beijing Afloat&quot; (curator: Feng Boyi), drew a crowd of over 1,000 people and marked the beginning of the popular infatuation with the area.

In 2002, Huang Rui (黄锐) and hutong photographer Xu Yong (徐勇) set up the 798 Space gallery (时态空间) next to BTAP. With its cavernous 1200-m2 floor and multiple-arched ceilings at the center of Factory 798, it was and still is the symbolic center of the whole district. (Huang and Xu since designed at least seven spaces in the area and became the prime movers and de facto spokespersons of the District.) A glass-fronted café was set up in the former office section at the back of the 798 space, opening into a back alley now lined with studios and restaurants such as Huang&#x27;s own At Café, and Cang Xin&#x27;s #6 Sichuan restaurant, the area&#x27;s &quot;canteen&quot;.

American Robert Bernell was the first to move in and brought his Timezone 8 Art Books bookshop, gallery and publishing office to a former factory canteen. One of Timezone 8&#x27;s early employees was fashion designer Xiao Li, who along with her husband, performance artist Cang Xin, and Bernell, helped artists secure and rent spaces in the area.

Through word-of-mouth, artists and designers started trickling in, attracted to the vast cathedral-like spaces. Despite the lack of any conscious aesthetic in the Bauhaus-inspired style, which grounded architectural beauty in practical, industrial function, the swooping arcs and soaring chimneys had an uplifting effect on modern eyes, a sort of post-industrial chic. At the artists&#x27; requests, workers renovating the spaces preserved the prominent Maoist slogans on the arches, adding a touch of ironic &quot;Mao kitsch&quot; to the place.

In 2003, Lu Jie (卢杰) set up the Long March Foundation, an ongoing project for artistic re-interpretation of the historical Long March, inside the 25,000 &quot;Li&quot; Cultural Transmission Center (二万五千里文化传播中心). Around that time, Singapore-owned China Art Seasons (北京季节画廊) opened for display for pan-Asian art, and was one of several new galleries setting up at that time.

The UCCA Center for Contemporary Art was set up shortly thereafter in one of the largest factories in the complex, and after recent renovations, serves as the anchor institution and most prominent, and most visited, art landmarks in the area.

==Notable exhibitions==

Several exhibitions of note took place in 2003. In March 2004, &quot;Transborder Language&quot;, part of the First Dashanzhi International Art Festival, (curators: Huang Rui and Thomas J. Berghuis) combined poetry installation and performance art. &quot;Blue Sky Exposure&quot; was held outdoors in southern Beijing and then relocated to the Art District. On April 13, despite widespread fear of public gatherings during SARS, the exhibitions &quot;Reconstruction 798&quot; (798 space) and &quot;Operation Ink Freedom&quot; (25,000 &quot;Li&quot; Cultural Transmission Center) drew crowds of 5,000 and definitely confirmed the area&#x27;s widespread appeal.

In July, with Beijing in full construction boom, Wang Wei&#x27;s &quot;Temporary Space&quot; (curator: Philip Tinari) featured workers completely enclosing an area of the exhibition with a brick wall and then removing the bricks one by one. In September, &quot;Left Hand - Right Hand&quot; (curator: Feng Boyi) showcased Chinese and German sculptors at 798 Space and Daoyaolu Workshop A. Among the works was Sui Jianguo&#x27;s enormous concrete sculpture &quot;Mao&#x27;s Right Hand&quot;, which is just what the name suggests, and an example of modern Chinese art&#x27;s ironic reflections on history.

The first Beijing Biennale was held on September 18, 2003 at the Art District and featured 14 exhibitions. &quot;Tui-Transfiguration&quot; (curator: Wu Hung; &quot;tui&quot; here roughly means &quot;moult&quot;) featured photographs by East Village chronicler Rong Rong (荣荣) and his wife, Japan-born Inri (映里). Their works notably featured their own naked bodies in various strange locales, and were generally well-received despite being criticized by some as typical of the self-centered nature of much art in the area.

The first Dashanzi International Art Festival, directed by the ever-present Huang Rui, was held from April 24 to May 23, 2004. This first edition, named &quot;Radiance and Resonance/Signals of Time&quot; (光•音 / 光阴), was beset by logistical problems arising from landowner Seven-Star Group&#x27;s increasing irritation with the art community. As such, the festival became as much a public protest against the area&#x27;s upcoming destruction that a showcase of art itself.

The environmental performance artist Brother Nut installed his project, &quot;Nongfu Spring Market,&quot; in 798 Art Zone in 2018. A commentary on pollution in China, this project received international attention including an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. One of the most (in)famous displays at the Festival was performance artist He Yunchang having himself cemented shut in a wooden box with only two pipes for ventilation, and staying there for 24 hours before being chiseled out, prompting the proverbial &quot;Is it art?&quot; questionings. &quot;Shock&quot; exhibitions have become increasingly common in the Art District.

In 2008 there were notable exhibitions of foreign artists from Italy (&quot;Rabarama. Italian Shape&quot;, AnniArt Gallery 798,): Rabarama and Cesare Berlingeri.

==Gentrification==

The district&#x27;s popularity has exploded since the opening of BTAP and 798 Space in 2002, with scores of galleries, lofts, publishing firms, design companies, high-end tailor shops, and cafés and fancy restaurants setting up. In 2003, around 30 artists and organizations had set up studios or offices in the area, with 200 more reportedly on the waiting list to move in.

Fashionable clubs also sprang up such as Zhou Ying&#x27;s &quot;Vibes&quot;, known for its fetish nights. A former factory cafeteria became Yan Club (仁俱乐部), owned by well-known Beijing socialite and writer Li Xuebing or &quot;Bing Bing&quot; (冰冰), also owner of Sanlitun&#x27;s Jam House. Notable performers at Yan included Morcheeba in March 2003.

In keeping with the area&#x27;s &quot;community spirit&quot;, most galleries and spaces in Dashanzi do not charge either exhibitors or visitors. Instead, they generally sustain themselves by hosting profitable fashion shows and corporate events; among others, Sony had a product launch gala at 798 space, and watchmaker Omega presented a fashion show at Yan Club. Others include Christian Dior, Royal Dutch Shell and Toyota; supermodel Cindy Crawford also made an appearance. Even Li Ka-shing&#x27;s Cheung Kong Holdings held an event in the district, which some found unsettling given the real-estate industry&#x27;s designs on the land it sits on.

As such, Dashanzi is now a center of Beijing&#x27;s nascent &quot;BoBo&quot; (bourgeois-bohemian) community. Huang Rui and Xu Yong are good representatives of the type. A local guru of sorts is artist/curator/architect Ai Weiwei (艾未未), whose self-designed house in Caochangdi just outside the factory complex was a trend-setter.

In the absence of any rent control, tenants&#x27; costs have escalated. In 2000–2001, rents were 0.8 RMB per square metre per day (24 RMB or US$2.90/m2/month, or about US$0.27/sq.foot/month). They increased slightly to 30 RMB/m2/month in 2003, and then doubled to 60 RMB/m2/month (US$0.67/sq.foot/month) in 2004. Total costs can be quite high considering the average 200–400 m2 area of the spaces, and the overhead of renovating and retrofitting the rooms to use modern appliances.

Another sign of creeping gentrification is the increasing number of luxury cars parked near the galleries; local artist Zhao Bandi purchased the first Alfa Romeo convertible in Beijing. Some (but not all) of the resident artists and their patrons are quite rich compared to other occupants of the area, the remaining factory workers. Some of the workshops are still operational on a small scale, mostly doing car repair or industrial laundry.

Some local artists such as Zhang Zhaohui, a New York-trained art critic and curator, and architect Zhu Jun, a new Dashanzi resident, have criticized the Art District as being less about art and more about show. Says Zhang: &quot;Few of the artists come to seriously practice art. Most of them just come for opportunities to exhibit and sell works or just have parties and gatherings.&quot; (&quot;China Daily&quot;) On the other hand, young artists like Zhang Yue find this atmosphere particularly conducive to establishing one&#x27;s career. In the course of one summer, Dashanzi Art District&#x27;s Platform China Contemporary Art Institute and Unlimited Art Gallery afforded this rising artist two well-received solo shows.

==Closure averted==

In the days of Joint Factory 718, Dashanzi was chosen for its peripheral position well outside the city center. The artists who later moved there were attracted from the fringes of the city as well. However, the area today sits right on the strategic corridor between the Capital Airport and downtown Beijing along the Airport Expressway. In the context of China&#x27;s current real estate bubble, the district is highly likely to be demolished in the near future. Hints of development are already appearing with the western entrances of the complex flanked by the Jiuxian and Hongyuan luxury apartment towers. There are all the current government projects which call for the expansion of the neighboring industrial park to turn all of Dashanzi into a high-tech development zone similar to Zhongguancun. Landowner Seven-Star Group thus hopes to re-employ some of the 10,000 laid-off workers it is still responsible for.

Influential members of the artist community and architects are lobbying various government instances to persuade them to allow the old buildings to remain, to help grow organically a cultural center that Beijing otherwise lacks. In 2003, International Architects Salon roped in architects from various international architectural associations and renowned architects like Bernard Tschumi and Coop Himmelblau&#x27;s Wolf Prix to help emphasize how important attractive spaces like Factory 798 are to the international design community. They point out that such communities are important if Beijing, and China, is to become a major source of creative design instead of mere low cost low value-added manufacturing. (This issue has far-reaching implications in the domain of intellectual property protection in China - some experts believe that the local IP laws will start to be enforced only when China becomes a source of its own intellectual property.)

A crucial participant in the lobbying effort is resident sculptor Li Xiangqun, professor at the Academy of Arts and Design of Tsinghua University, who was elected deputy of the 12th National People&#x27;s Congress in 2004. Li presented the municipal government with a formal bill in February, requesting the suspension of the destruction plans and preservation of the buildings as part of an Olympic-caliber cultural center.

Professors from architecture schools such as Beijing&#x27;s Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Southern California Institute of Architecture have proposed various development plans for the area that involve preserving the buildings, although those do not appear especially profitable financially.

Meanwhile, attempts have been made to appeal to the developers&#x27; sense of economics by pointing out similarities with New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village and SoHo, where the high profitability of real estate is due partly to the presence of former post-industrial artists&#x27; dwellings. Those arguments have so far been ignored.

In 2004, Seven-Star Group froze the rental of new spaces and prohibited all renewals. Tenants resorted to subdividing and subleasing their spaces, to which the Group responded by attempting to forbid subleasing to cultural organizations or to foreigners, hoping to drive out the artists. Tenants, despite some of them having leases still valid for several years, were given the ultimatum of December 31, 2005 to vacate the premises.

By 2006, public outcry was relentless, and prominent cultural organizations from around the world spoke up. An unlikely duo including SevenStar, a government-led consortium acting as stewards of a pension fund for former factory workers, and Guy Ullens, a Belgian philanthropist who had amassed the world&#x27;s largest collection of contemporary Chinese art, commissioned Boston-based design firm Sasaki Associates to produce a vision plan which sought to re-purpose the district into a stable source of revenue while providing a much-needed destination for China&#x27;s burgeoning arts scene. The plan needed to inspire multiple stakeholders with often divergent interests. First, the city government in Beijing wanted to ensure that the district would a visible and acclaimed destination. Second, the land-holder, SevenStar Group, needed to generate a sustainable revenue stream to endow the pension fund of former factory workers. Third, international and Chinese non-profit cultural institutions investing in 798 such as the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art wanted to focus on culture and protecting the district&#x27;s distinctive character. Finally, residents of adjacent neighborhoods were vocal about the need for community parks, recreation, and job opportunities. 
Considering these voices equally, the Sasaki Associates master plan for 798 endeavored to reach consensus with a long-game approach to redevelopment. Leading with clear principles and detailed guidelines, the plan was an opportunity to codify the values of the district. To address the city&#x27;s concerns, connections from nearby transit stations were strengthened, historic buildings were cataloged, and guidelines for their preservation and adaptive reuse were outlined. Next, a long-term strategy for obtaining revenue from new building leases was realized. A proposed arts school, artist-in-residence program, and requirements that tenants are involved in a creative industry provided cultural institutions with a sense that 798 would attract new talent and ideas. Last, multiple parks and plazas responded to community desire for more public open space.

By the end of 2007, it was decided that the area would continue in its current format of a special art zone. In 2009, the area has been refurbished and is thriving. 798&#x27;s abandoned factory buildings have been transformed into new museums, galleries, and cafes. Fallow fields and once hidden courtyards have reemerged as settings for outdoor sculpture, fashion shows, and other cultural events. The roads have been repaved, new galleries have opened, and a cafe culture is emerging. What began as a small collection of ephemeral studios and other workspaces has become the third most visited destination in Beijing, after the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.

<text>Interneurons (also called internuncial neurons, association neurons, connector neurons, or intermediate neurons) are neurons that are not specifically motor neurons or sensory neurons. Interneurons are the central nodes of neural circuits, enabling communication between sensory or motor neurons and the central nervous system (CNS). They play vital roles in reflexes, neuronal oscillations, and neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.

Interneurons can be further broken down into two groups: local interneurons and relay interneurons. Local interneurons have short axons and form circuits with nearby neurons to analyze small pieces of information. Relay interneurons have long axons and connect circuits of neurons in one region of the brain with those in other regions. However, interneurons are generally considered to operate mainly within local brain areas. The interaction between interneurons allows the brain to perform complex functions such as learning and decision-making.

==Structure==
In the human brain, approximately 20–30% of the neurons in the neocortex are interneurons, and the remaining majority of neurons are pyramidal. Investigations into the molecular diversity of neurons is impeded by the inability to isolate cell populations born at different times for gene expression analysis. An effective means of identifying coetaneous interneurons is neuronal birthdating. This can be achieved using nucleoside analogs such as EdU.

In 2008, a nomenclature for the features of GABAergic cortical interneurons was proposed, called &quot;Petilla terminology&quot;.

=== Spinal cord ===
* Ia inhibitory interneuron: Found in lamina VII. Responsible for inhibiting antagonist motor neuron. 1a spindle afferents activate 1a inhibitory neuron.
* Ib inhibitory interneuron: Found in lamina V, VI, VII. Afferent or Golgi tendon organ activates it.

=== Cortex ===
* Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons
* CCK-expressing interneurons
* VIP-expressing interneurons
* SOM-expressing interneurons

=== Cerebellum ===
* Molecular layer (basket cells, stellate cells)
* Golgi cells
* Granule cells
* Lugaro cells
* Unipolar brush cells

===Striatum===
*Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons
*Cholinergic interneurons
*Tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing interneurons
*Calretinin-expressing interneurons
*Nitric oxide synthase-expressing interneurons

==Function==
Interneurons in the CNS are primarily inhibitory, and use the neurotransmitter GABA or glycine. However, excitatory interneurons using glutamate in the CNS also exist, as do interneurons releasing neuromodulators like acetylcholine.

In addition to these general functions, interneurons in the insect CNS play a number of specific roles in different parts of the nervous system, and also are either excitatory or inhibitory. For example, in the olfactory system, interneurons are responsible for integrating information from odorant receptors and sending signals to the mushroom bodies, which are involved in learning and memory. In the visual system, interneurons are responsible for processing motion information and sending signals to the optic lobes, which are involved in visual navigation.

Interneurons are also important for coordinating complex behaviors, such as flight and locomotion. For example, interneurons in the thoracic ganglia are responsible for coordinating the activity of the leg muscles during walking and flying.

Interneurons&#x27; main function is to provide a neural circuit, conducting flow of signals or information between sensory neurons and motor neurons.

<text>The is a compact sedan manufactured by Honda and marketed only in Japan from 1989 until 1997. The first generation produced two versions based on the Honda Accord CB series called the Ascot and from 1993 to 1996 a &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; called the Ascot Innova. The Innova shared much of its mechanicals with the European-market Accord manufactured at the Honda UK facility in Swindon, England, and was essentially the badge engineered Rover 600. The second generation was a platform improvement, shared with the Japan-only sedan called the Honda Rafaga.
The &quot;Ascot&quot; name was chosen with reference to the Ascot Racecourse and Ascot tie, in order to add the model an alleged air of class and elegance. Honda Ascot was also used on a range of one-cylinder motorcycles in the first half of the 1980s.


== First generation (CB1/2/3/4) ==
The first Honda Ascot was borne out Honda&#x27;s strategy to diversify its sales channels in Japan. In 1985, two separate dealer networks were established, under the names of &quot;Honda Clio&quot; and &quot;Honda Primo&quot;, in addition to the already existing &quot;Honda Verno&quot; network. While the &quot;Primo&quot; stores handled &quot;kei cars&quot;, as well as the Honda Civic, the &quot;Clio&quot; stores focused on larger models, including the top-of-the-line Honda Legend. With the arrival of the fourth-generation Honda Accord (CB) its sales were assigned solely to &quot;Honda Clio&quot;.

That meant, however, that the &quot;Honda Primo&quot; network needed an Accord-based compact sedan for the dealership channel. Honda adopted a rather simple solution of creating a &quot;sister car&quot; to Accord, the Honda Ascot. Technically, the Ascot was identical to the Accord sedan, and the interior, including the dashboard, was shared with the Accord. The exterior sheetmetal was unique to the Ascot, with cosmetic differences provided for a different look, befitting the Ascot&#x27;s upmarket role as the top-of-the-line model of &quot;Honda Primo&quot;, which sold small, entry-level products. The headlight units were sourced from the Honda Inspire, adding to its luxurious appearance, as well as installing LED high mounted brake light in the trunk rear spoiler. 

It came in five trim levels; the FB and the FBX came with the 1.8 litre engine, with the 2.0Si, 2.0FBX-i as the mid-level package, with the top level 2.0FBT-i included four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, traction control, a viscous coupling differential, mechanical four-wheel steering, and four-wheel double wishbone suspension, with the 2.0 Liter PGM-FI fuel injection engine. Two different engine displacement choices were given so as to allow the Japanese driver which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The fuel economy for the top level engine was rated at according to figures quoted in sales materials. Here&#x27;s a Honda promotional video introducing the Ascot FBT-i.

The Ascot had a six-light greenhouse compared to the regular Accord&#x27;s four-light layout, and featured a different front end with a more formal grille, as well as a revised rear end with an Ascot specific rear tail light treatment, installing the rear license plate indented into the rear bumper. The styling approach was also duplicated on the smaller Honda Concerto, a platform shared with the Honda Civic of the same time period.

The Ascot was launched on September 13, 1989, and the television commercials initially featured the &quot;Take the A-Train&quot; jazz standard A-train commercial. Later on, Honda decided to change the marketing image of the car, employing Eric Clapton to do the commercials. In August 1991, a rehashed Ascot was presented, allegedly &quot;refined to better suit the Japanese taste&quot;. In March 1992, Honda presented an all-new Honda Ascot Innova (see below), while the regular Ascot was replaced by an all-new model in 1993.

== Ascot Innova (CB3/4) ==

Launched on March 5, 1992, the () was also based on the CB Accord underpinnings, but was given an all-new, modern-looking and rounded body, with styling similar to the Honda Prelude BB4 series (1992–1996). It was the result of a joint effort with the Rover Group that provided Rover with the 600 series, and an Accord that was unique to Europe. The Innova retained the original Ascot&#x27;s six-light greenhouse layout and horizontal taillights, as well as long, sleek and low body proportions (as opposed to the second-generation Ascot&#x27;s upright stance and more Accord CF-like rear end). The Innova was fitted with frameless side glazing to provide for the &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; look, thus being Honda&#x27;s answer to cars like the Toyota Carina ED/Toyota Corona EXiV, Nissan Bluebird ARX and Mitsubishi Emeraude. The Ascot Innova was sold in conjunction to the Ascot, and did not replace it.

The Ascot Innova was available in three four-cylinder engine choices: the 2.0-litre F20A unit, producing in the less expensive 2.0iC and 2.0i versions with SOHC, in the 2.0Si trim with DOHC, and the H-series 2.3-litre H23A engine fitted in the export versions of the Prelude, producing (the 2.3-litre versions were designated 2.3Si-Z). While the 2.0-litre versions maintained the width which allowed them to remain in the favorable tax class, the 2.3-litre Innovas were wide, as the engine displacement didn&#x27;t allow them to remain in the lower tax band, and buyers in Japan were also liable for a higher annual road tax bill also.

A 4-wheel steering system like the one in the Prelude was made available for the 2.0i, 2.0Si, and 2.3Si-Z versions. Apart from the cheapest 2.0iC version, which came with a 5-speed manual transmission, all Ascot Innovas came with a 4-speed automatic. The Ascot Innova range started at ¥1,558,000 for the 2.0iC in the Tokyo sales area, while the most expensive 2.3Si-Z fetched ¥2,992,000 in Sapporo area, not including extra charges for options such as 4-wheel steering, moonroof, passenger airbag, cornering lamps or ABS. The television advertising campaign was built around the slogan &quot;Hardtop Innovation&quot; and featured the American actress Geena Davis.

The Ascot Innova itself remained a JDM-only model, and a &quot;Honda Primo&quot; exclusive, with no JDM sister cars. It was the result of shared efforts with British partner Rover Group, and the car was sold as the European Accord, which was made in Swindon, UK and marketed in Europe as Honda Accord instead of the North American version. The European Accord and the Ascot Innova differ only slightly, with the Euro-Accord being wider and featuring framed windows. Normally, this type of vehicle with a sports car influence would have been sold at &quot;Honda Verno&quot;, however because of its strong similarity to the Prelude, and &quot;Honda Verno&quot; already had a luxury sports sedan called the Honda Vigor, the Ascott Innova was assigned to &quot;Honda Primo&quot; instead, as &quot;Honda Clio&quot; had the Honda Legend.

The European Accord was in turn the base for the Rover 600 saloon, developed under Honda&#x27;s long-standing relationship with the British Rover Group. The Rover 600 and the Swindon Accord also shared two engine options not available for the Ascot Innova - Honda&#x27;s F18A 1.8-litre unit and Rover&#x27;s 2.0-litre L-series turbo-diesel. The Ascot Innova remained in production until 1996, while the European Accord saloon continued until 1998, with a facelifted model in 1996. In 1998, it was replaced with an all-new model.

== Second generation (CE) ==

The next-generation (CD) Accord grew in size considerably, mostly to satisfy North American market efforts, and thus became too wide to fit within the favorable Japanese tax class. Therefore, Honda needed a slightly smaller compact sedan to cater to the JDM market, and this duty was assigned to the new Ascot
*Japanese TV commercial for the Honda Ascot.

Rather than being directly based on the now larger Accord, the new Ascot was given its own platform, with the codenames CE4/5, which was a platform improvement of the previous generation. Like the Inspire, Vigor and the even larger Honda Legend, the CE Ascot had its engines mounted longitudinally, contrary to the Accord and most other FWD cars, employing the transverse setup, thereby placing the weight of the engine aligned and behind the front axle and improving vehicle weight distribution between the front and rear axles. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel.

The new Ascot had a sloping appearance resembling a coupé, rendering the vehicle shorter and taller than both the CD Accord, Ascot Innova and the Inspire, thus continuing the first Ascot&#x27;s role as a premium entry-level formal sedan. It was fitted with the 5-cylinder inline Honda G engine, also employed by the Inspire and Vigor, in two displacement versions - 2.0-litre and 2.5-litre, with the gearbox slotted behind it. The wheelbase of the Ascot was shorter than the slightly longer Inspire and Vigor, which measured at , a difference of , which didn&#x27;t leave much room for rear seat passengers. Furthermore, due to the lengthwise installation of the five-cylinder engine, and the requirement that the overall length of the car comply with Japanese government regulations concerning cars classified as &quot;compact&quot;, compromises were made with regards to rear passenger accommodations, and sales suffered as a result. The Ascot also spawned a sister car, the Honda Rafaga, which was sold at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; stores, which differed from the Ascot only by different external trim details. Both models were replaced by the CF series Accord platform twin Honda Torneo in 1997.

<text>The China Campaign Medal is a decoration of the United States Army which was created by order of the United States War Department on January 12, 1905. The medal recognizes service in the China Relief Expedition which was conducted by the United States Army at the turn on the 20th century during the Boxer Rebellion.

==Description and history==

To be awarded the China Campaign Medal, a service member must have performed military duty in China, between June 20, 1900, and May 27, 1901, with such duty being in service of the China Relief Expedition. For those service members who were cited for gallantry in action, the Citation Star is authorized as a device to the China Campaign Medal.

The United States Navy equivalent of the China Campaign Medal was the China Relief Expedition Medal.

===Obverse===
On the obverse is the Imperial Chinese five-toed dragon with the inscription CHINA RELIEF EXPEDITION around the upper border and the dates 1900–1901 at the bottom.

===Reverse===
On the reverse is a trophy composed of an eagle perched on a cannon supported by crossed flags, rifles, an Indian shield, spear and quiver of arrows, a Cuban machete, and a Sulu kris. Below the trophy are the words FOR SERVICE. Around the border at the top are the words UNITED STATES ARMY and around the bottom are thirteen stars.

===Ribbon===
The ribbon is 1 inches wide and is composed of the following vertical stripes: 1/16 inch Ultramarine blue, 1 inch Golden yellow, and 1/16 inch Ultramarine Blue.

===Streamers===
Army units which received credit for campaign participation may display the streamer on the organizational flag. The inscription will be as indicated on the unit&#x27;s lineage and honors.

There are three streamers displayed on the Army flag to represent the China Relief Expedition. The inscriptions are:

*TIENTSIN 1900
*YANG-TSUN 1900
*PEKING 1900

<text>Newark Penn Station is an intermodal passenger station in Newark, New Jersey. One of the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s major transportation hubs, Newark Penn Station is served by multiple rail and bus carriers, making it the seventh busiest rail station in the United States, and the fourth busiest in the New York City metropolitan area.

Located at Raymond Plaza between Market Street and Raymond Boulevard, the station is served by three NJ Transit commuter rail lines, the Newark Light Rail, the PATH rapid transit system, and all 10 of Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor services, including the &quot;Acela&quot;. The station is also Newark&#x27;s main intercity bus terminal; it is served by carriers Greyhound, Bolt, and Fullington Trailways. Additionally, it is served by 33 local and regional bus lines operated by NJ Transit Bus Operations.

== History ==
Designed by the renowned architectural firm McKim, Mead &amp; White, the same team behind the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s original New York Penn Station ten miles to the east, the station has Art Deco and Neo-Classical features. The main waiting room has medallions showing the history of transportation, from wagons to steamships to cars and airplanes, the eventual doom of the railroad age. Chandeliers are decorated with Zodiac signs. The building was dedicated on March 23, 1935; the first regular train to use it was a New York–Philadelphia express at 10:17 on March 24.

The new station was built alongside (northwest of) the old station, which was then demolished and replaced by the southeast half of the present station, completed in 1937. Except for the separate, underground Newark Light Rail station, all tracks are above street level.

It was to be one of the centerpieces of Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s (PRR&#x27;s) train network, and to become a transfer point to the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (now PATH), which was partially funded by the PRR, for travel to lower Manhattan. PRR then scheduled 232 weekday trains through Newark, about two-thirds of them to or from New York Penn Station and the rest to/from Exchange Place in Jersey City.

The station itself, the adjacent 230-foot Dock Bridge over the Passaic River (the longest three-track railway lift span in existence at the time) and the realignments of the Newark City Subway (now Newark Light Rail) and H&amp;M cost $42 million, borne almost evenly by the PRR and the City of Newark. The City Subway extension and H&amp;M realignment opened on June 20, 1937, and the nearby Manhattan Transfer station was closed, along with the H&amp;M&#x27;s original Park Place station.

The Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) bought the bankrupt H&amp;M Railroad and reorganized it as Port Authority Trans-Hudson in 1962. New Jersey Department of Transportation&#x27;s Aldene Plan redirected Central Railroad of New Jersey and Reading Railroad trains from Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City to Newark Penn Station in 1967. The Pennsylvania Railroad merged with longtime rival New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Railroad, but Newark kept the name &quot;Penn Station.&quot; In 1970, Penn Station became the sole intercity station in Newark when the Erie Lackawanna ran its last intercity trains through Broad Street Station.

After Amtrak took over inter-city service in 1971, Penn Central continued to operate commuter service, despite being bankrupt. In 1976 the New Jersey Department of Transportation acquired Penn Central, Reading and Jersey Central passenger service, which included lines from as far away as Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA diesel service along the West Trenton Line, with Conrail operating service under contract. New Jersey Transit acquired the rail line north of West Trenton in 1982, and established its rail operations division in 1983, acquiring almost all commuter rail service from Conrail within the state.

When Gateway Center and the Newark Legal Center were built, skybridges were also installed to connect these office buildings to Penn Station.

Newark Penn Station was extensively renovated in 2007, with restoration of the facade and historic interior materials (e.g., plaster ceilings, marble and limestone, windows, lighting fixtures), as well as train platform and equipment improvements.

In 2017, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey conducted a study on extending PATH&#x27;s Newark–World Trade Center line from Penn Station to Newark Liberty International Airport Station so that passengers could transfer to Newark Liberty International Airport&#x27;s AirTrain Newark.

In August 2019 the United States Department of Transportation awarded $18.4 million to NJ Transit to rehabilitate and repair Platform &quot;D&quot; that serves Tracks 3 &amp; 4 and is a major transfer point for Amtrak and NJ Transit.

On the morning of December 14, 2023, NJ Transit service was delayed for 45 minutes at Newark Penn Station because a long-horned bull was running loose along one of the station&#x27;s tracks. The bull, who had escaped from a nearby slaughterhouse, was tranquilized, safely removed from the tracks, and transported to Skylands Animal Sanctuary in Wantage, where he was named Ricardo.

In 2023 ground was broken on the Mulberry Commons Pedestrian Bridge, a footbridge over McCarter Highway and the Northeast Corridor and a new train hall entrance with direct access to the platforms at Newark Penn. It will connect Mulberry Commons to Peter Francisco Park in the Ironbound, and eventually link to Newark Riverfront Park.

== Current operations ==
===Amtrak===
Newark Penn is served by all 10 services running along the Northeast Corridor. In 2014, Newark Penn was the 14th busiest station in the Amtrak system, the eighth busiest in the Mid-Atlantic region (behind New York Penn, Washington Union, Philadelphia, Baltimore Penn, Albany-Rensselaer, BWI Airport and Wilmington) and by far the busiest of the six Amtrak stations in New Jersey. Since the 1970s, it has been the only intercity rail station in heavily populated northeastern New Jersey.

Due to the wide availability of alternatives, including the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and &quot;Acela,&quot; passengers are not usually allowed to use Amtrak&#x27;s long distance trains to Florida, New Orleans, or Chicago for local travel between Newark and New York.

Newark Penn Station carries the IATA airport code of ZRP.

===NJ Transit===
Three NJ Transit commuter rail lines converge here: the Northeast Corridor Line, North Jersey Coast Line and the Raritan Valley Line. The former two continue to New York at all times via Secaucus Junction. The Raritan Valley Line generally terminates here, with the exception of certain off-peak weekday trains that continue to New York and one inbound weekday train that continues to Hoboken. Formerly, the North Jersey Coast Line also offered limited service to Hoboken, though present-day schedules have eliminated this service.

=== PATH ===
Newark Penn Station is the western terminus of the Newark–World Trade Center line of the PATH train, operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Trains discharge on Platform H (upper level) and return to service on the lower level (platform B/C). Until the opening of Secaucus Junction in 2003, NJ Transit commuter rail passengers and Amtrak intercity passengers had to transfer to PATH here in order to reach Jersey City or Hoboken.

=== Newark Light Rail ===
On the lower level is the southern terminus of the Newark Light Rail (formerly the Newark City Subway), with three outbound tracks and two inbound tracks. Passengers on this light rail system from Newark and its nearby suburbs can transfer to Amtrak, NJ Transit or PATH trains, or travel to Newark Broad Street or downtown Newark. The Broad Street extension, opened in 2006, was intended to ease transfers between the former Erie Lackawanna commuter routes that call at Broad Street and the Amtrak and former PRR commuter routes that call at Newark Penn Station. Previously, passengers had to make their own way (usually by taxi or bus) between the two stations.

=== Tracks and platforms ===
Newark Penn Station has eight tracks and six platforms for both NJT and PATH (Newark Light Rail not included), but PATH trains from NYC arrive on the upper level and ones from South Street arrive on the lower level.
* Track A is less used and has a side platform, usually for Raritan Valley Line arrivals. Trains relay and lay-up at Hudson Yard in Harrison before returning on Track 5 for the reverse trip. Occasionally used by Amtrak trains to New York Penn Station.
* Track 1 is normally used by New Jersey Transit trains to New York Penn Station and is served by an island platform shared with Track M.
* Track 2 is typically used by northbound Amtrak and New Jersey Transit express trains. This track has an island platform that is shared with track M.
* Track 3 is usually used by southbound Amtrak trains, though westbound New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor Line express trains will often use this track in the evening rush hours. This platform has an island platform shared with track 4.
* Track 4 is normally used by westbound New Jersey Transit trains traveling via Newark Airport or Rahway.
* Track 5 is usually used by westbound Raritan Valley Line trains and weekend eastbound Raritan Valley Line trains terminating. This track has a side platform. This track has closed periodically since 2013.
* Track M is the track for departing PATH trains to World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.
* Track H is for discharging PATH trains. This upper-level track, which did not have turnstiles until SmartLink ones were installed in 2005, has stairs to Track 2, along with ramps to Tracks 3 and 4, and a separate stairway to Track 5. Trains relay and lay-up south of the station before returning on Track M for the trip to World Trade Center. There are two pairs of crossover switches south of the station for that purpose, as well as a center track from which trains can be reversed quickly.

<text>The Zurich S-Bahn () system is a network of rail lines that has been incrementally expanded to cover the ZVV area, which comprises the entire canton of Zurich and portions of neighbouring cantons (Aargau, Glarus, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, St. Gallen, Thurgau and Zug), with a few lines extending into or crossing the territory of southern Germany. The network is one of many commuter rail operations in German speaking countries to be described as an S-Bahn. The lines connect with services of Aargau S-Bahn to the West, Basel S-Bahn (only in ) and Schaffhausen S-Bahn to the North, St. Gallen S-Bahn to the East, and Lucerne S-Bahn/Zug Stadtbahn to the South, as well as with InterCity, InterRegio and RegioExpress services at major junction stations.

The entire ZVV S-Bahn network went into operation in May 1990, although many of the lines were already in operation.

Unusual among rapid transit services, the Zurich S-Bahn provides first class commuter travel; about a quarter of seats on each train are first class.

==History==
Before the construction of the Zurich S-Bahn, most trains to Zurich terminated at Zürich Hauptbahnhof (), apart from the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn lines which terminated at Zürich Selnau. Originally built as a west-facing terminus, the Hauptbahnhof acted as a terminus for trains coming from all directions. It was connected to lines to the north and northeast via the Wipkingen Tunnel and Zürich Oerlikon railway station. The Hauptbahnhof was also connected via the Letten Tunnel to the Lake Zurich right-bank railway line to the southeast. This line also stopped at Stadelhofen station at the opposite side of the city centre, before passing through the single track tunnel to Letten station, then turning 180 degrees to reach the Hauptbahnhof. This line travelled to cover the distance between Stadelhofen and the Hauptbahnhof.

=== Gold Coast Express ===
The first step in developing Zurich&#x27;s rail system which eventually led to the establishment of the S-Bahn was the establishment of the so-called &quot;Gold Coast Express&quot; () on 26 May 1968 between Zurich Stadelhofen and Rapperswil via Meilen along the wealthy north shore of Lake Zurich, popularly known as the &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. This development came about because, after World War II, there was a rapid expansion of commuting to Zurich from the former wine-growing villages along the railway line, which originally opened in 1894. As a result, commuters complained that the trains were overcrowded, slow and often delayed.

The canton of Zurich began to develop a project to improve the railway in the 1950s. Because it was not used by either long-distance passenger or freight trains, improvements in local services were possible. Double track sections were built between Kuesnacht and Herrliberg and between Stäfa and Uerikon, along with new stations. The main problem was finance. Development of the line would only serve local interests and would not lead to increased revenue for Swiss Federal Railways (SFR). At the time the canton and cities affected could not fund improvements to an SFR line, so the law was changed to allow local contributions.

The new &quot;Gold Coast Express&quot; service operated a regular schedule every half-hour, with the total journey time for the distance of reduced from the previous 60 to 40 minutes. The most striking feature of the improved railway was the three-car claret-coloured RABDe 12/12 electric multiple units. These had good acceleration and braking performance and immediately became known as &quot;Mirages&quot;, after the jet fighters. The modern features of the Mirages included automatically closing doors, which allowed short stops at stations and a reduction in travel time.

===U-Bahn rejection ===

On 30 May 1959 some voters put two proposals to the Zurich ciry council. The first would have allocated CHF 200,000 for a study on the construction of a two-line (underground railway) with lines from Enge to Kloten and from Altstetten to Tiefenbrunnen; but it was opposed by the majority of the City Council and failed. The second motion proposed the establishment of a company to build and operate a Zurich U-Bahn. The city had already considered such a proposal and opposed it, on the basis that Zurich was not big enough for an underground railway, and it would cost too much. In a referendum on 14 February 1960, 69.8% of voters voted &quot;no&quot; to the proposal.

Following further work and the enactment of a new transport act, the regional public transport authorities presented a new proposal for a combined regional U-Bahn and S-Bahn system, with the latter being a railway network centred on a tunnel under the city centre, which would connect to existing suburban railway lines. From Zurich Airport, an U-Bahn line would run via Glattbrugg, Oerlikon, Hirschenwiesen, Central, Zürich Hauptbahnhof, Stauffacher and Altstetten to Dietikon. Much of the line would have run above ground. The second part of the proposal was the &quot;Zürichberg network&quot;, a line from Zürich Hauptbahnhof via a new tunnel under the Zürichberg to Dietlikon to the northeast (not to be confused with Dietikon, which lies to the west of Zurich). The proposed construction of an underground station in Museumstrasse on the north side of the Hauptbahnhof was intended to ease the pressure on the Hauptbahnhof. On 20 May 1973 this proposal was rejected in a referendum, with the &quot;no&quot; vote as high as in the previous referendum. At the referendum, little opposition had been expressed against the proposed S-Bahn lines.

===Coordination and construction of the S-Bahn===

Rail is a major element in Zurich&#x27;s public transport system, and its upgrade required close collaboration between the canton of Zurich and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), the owner of most of the railways. The SBB CFF FFS had insufficient resources for a substantial upgrade of commuter services. On the other hand, the canton of Zurich could not fund an alternative transport network.

The first step towards cooperation came in 1978 with the establishment of a Transport Fund providing CHF 40 million annually for urban transport. The routes of today&#x27;s S-Bahn were established in a debate in the cantonal Council on 19 June 1978. Alternative &quot;eastern&quot; and &quot;western&quot; options were discussed. Under the western option the northern end of the central tunnel from the Hauptbahnhof would have connected with Oerlikon, while in the eastern option it would have tunneled under the Zürichberg and ended near Dietlikon. The cantonal Council chose the eastern option by 85 votes to 36.

At a referendum on 29 November 1981, Zurich&#x27;s voters approved by a two-thirds majority a loan of CHF 520 million for the construction of the core of the S-Bahn. The following changes were made:
*The construction of the Hirschengraben tunnel between the Hauptbahnhof and Stadelhofen. Four new platforms were built under the existing Hauptbahnhof, along with connections to the existing western lines. The Letten Tunnel and station were closed.
*The construction of the Zürichberg Tunnel, which connected Stadelhofen to lines to the northeast, as well as having a new station at Stettbach.
*The extension of the Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn lines from Selnau to the Hauptbahnhof, with the Selnau terminus closed and replaced with an underground through station.
*The opening of Hardbrücke railway station in 1982, between the Hauptbahnhof and Altstetten to the west.
*The redevelopment of Stadelhofen station, with an architecture award-winning design by Santiago Calatrava.

===Opening and expansion===
On 27 May 1990, the S-Bahn was brought into operation and the &quot;Zürcher Verkehrsverbund&quot; (Zurich Transport Network) began operations. For the first time, one could travel on trains, buses and trams with just one ticket. Despite &quot;teething problems&quot;, passenger numbers increased rapidly. Since the opening of the S-Bahn, travel volumes have increased by about 60%. In several stages, S-Bahn services were expanded to a rail network, and peak hour express trains were added.

The first stage of the expansion addressed the chronic overcrowding of trains on the S12 route between Dietikon and Zurich, requiring improvements in the Limmat valley. The widening of the railway to four tracks between Dietikon and Killwangen allowed the separation of the S-Bahn from the long-distance and freight services. The new S3 service introduced as a result complemented the S12 service, to provide a train every 15 minutes on the route. At the same time the sections of the S9 route via Knonau were upgraded to allow services to be increased to each half hour. Services on the north side of Lake Zurich were increased with trains provided every 15 minutes by S6, S7 and S16 services. A new station was opened at Glanzberg between Dietikon and Schlieren.

Under the second stage of expansion in December 2002, night trains were added to the S-Bahn. Since 2007, night trains provide a continuous 24-hour service from Friday morning until Sunday evening on some lines.

The third stage expansion was completed in 2007. On 12 December 2004 (coinciding with the completion of the first stage of Rail 2000), the S3 service was extended from Dietikon through the Heitersberg Tunnel to Aarau with a new station at Mellingen. On 10 December 2006, S15 was opened between Rapperswil and Birmensdorf following line improvements. It was extended from Birmensdorf to Affoltern am Albis on 9 December 2007. South of Zurich sections of the Sihltalbahn were doubled. On the rural feeder lines around Winterthur (S33 to Schaffhausen, S35 to Wil and S41 to Bülach) services were increased to run every half hour. The S8 was extended from Winterthur to Weinfelden, providing with the existing S30 services two trains an hour on the line. In addition, the S16 was extended every hour to Schaffhausen, stopping after Winterthur only at Andelfingen and Neuhausen am Rheinfall. Moreover, on the line from Winterthur to Wil a new station opened at Winterthur Hegi.

=== Opening of the Weinberg Tunnel ===
Following a successful referendum, a project was established to create a new route between the Hauptbahnhof and Oerlikon station. Unlike the existing two routes between the stations, the Weinberg tunnel would approach the Hauptbahnhof from the east, allowing trains to run between the western and northern lines without bypassing the central station. This route was known as (), and was for use of both long-distance and S-Bahn trains. The project also included a third set of underground platforms under Zürich Hauptbahnhof, a new elevated route through the western approaches and two extra platforms at Oerlikon.

Breakthrough of the new Weinberg Tunnel was achieved in November 2010, and it was opened to traffic on the 14 June 2014. On the same date, the new platforms, also known as the Löwenstrasse station, were opened. Whilst the other works are still outstanding and expected to be completed in 2015, the partial completion resulted in significant changes to the Zurich S-Bahn.

These changes included the diversion of lines S2, S8 and S14 through the Weinberg Tunnel. These lines previously ran via Zürich Wipkingen station, and in order to prevent that station losing service, S24 was extended from Zürich Hauptbahnhof station via Wipkingen to Zürich Oerlikon station. At the same time, the former Glarner Sprinter, a two-hourly train service from Zürich Hauptbahnhof to Linthal, was replaced with a new hourly S-Bahn service, the S25. These major changes resulted in a number of other changes, with service to various stations being provided by different lines.

== Operation ==
=== Current services ===
 32 services comprise the Zurich S-Bahn network. The lines are numbered (2‒21, 23‒26, 29‒30, 33, 35‒36, 40‒42) using the prefix &quot;S&quot;, which is typical for S-Bahn systems. With the exception of lines S13, S17, S18, S26, S29, S30, S33, S35, S36, S40, and S41, all routes run through or terminate at Zurich main station. The S27 service between and , operated by SOB during peak-hours, is neither part of the Zurich S-Bahn nor the St. Gallen S-Bahn network.

Unless noted otherwise, all services operate every 30 minutes throughout the day and follow a strict, regular timetable. This is known in the German speaking world as a &quot;Taktfahrplan&quot;, or clock-face scheduling in English. There may be additional trains during peak periods, and a reduced frequency in the evenings and/or at weekends. Timely connecting services often exist at junction stations.

=== Nighttime services ===
During weekends, in the night from Friday to Saturday and from Saturday to Sunday, there are nighttime S-Bahn services (designated SN followed by the route number) and nighttime bus services (designated N followed by the line number). Nighttime services operate from 1 o&#x27;clock until the early morning hours. The nighttime S-Bahn and bus routes form a network, which is different from the daytime network. Most SN services run hourly. As of December 2022, the following nighttime S-Bahn services existed:

=== Previous services ===
* The S1 formerly linked Zurich and Zug via Thalwil. It was renamed the S21 after the opening of the S1 line of the Lucerne-Zug network (Zug Stadtbahn and Lucerne S-Bahn) in 2004 to avoid confusion. It is discontinued and replaced with the part of the line S24. 
* The former S11 was a rush hour service. It was subsumed into the S23 in December 2018 when the current S11 service opened.
* The former S12 operated between Brugg and Seuzach/Seen until December 2018.
* The former S21 was subsumed into the S24 after the opening of the Weinberg Tunnel in 2014.
* The S22 formerly linked Bülach with Singen (in Germany) via Schaffhausen. It has been replaced by the S9 and S24 services, respectively, in 2015. A line numbered S22 still ran between and until 2018, operated by THURBO, but this route is currently running as two separate lines of Schaffhausen S-Bahn (S62 and S65).
* The S31 used to run across the Seedamm, between Rapperswil and Pfäffikon SZ.
* The S43 ran between Rüti ZH and Wald ZH (near Rapperswil) and had only three stations and was in fact a limited service of S26. It has been replaced by a bus route.
* The S55 formerly linked Niederweningen and Oberglatt, as a short-working of the S5. It has now been replaced by the S15.
* The S3 formerly operated between Wetzikon and Aarau via Dietikon. However its western route is overtaken by the S11, it runs to Hardbrücke (or Bülach) instead.

=== International services ===
Two Zurich S-Bahn services cross the international border into Germany. Service S9 crosses German territory between Rafz and Schaffhausen (both in Switzerland), calling at the German stations of Lottstetten and Jestetten. These two stations are located entirely on German soil, but all the infrastructure belongs to SBB. Service S36 crosses the border at the end of its journey, in order to terminate at Waldshut station in Germany.

==Network map==
== Future developments ==
Further improvements are envisaged, including two additional tracks at Oerlikon railway station, a passing loop in Pfäffikon and adjustments at various stations. Further improvements in the corridor between the airport and Winterthur are being developed as part of the second stage of Rail 2000 for long-distance trains, which would require further adjustments for the S-Bahn.

In the longer term, a vision for 2030 named Projekt S-Bahn 2G includes the development of two types of S-Bahn services and trains. Inner services will operate every 15 minutes, and will be provided by single-deck trains, so that passengers can embark and disembark quickly. Outer express services will operate every half-hour, stopping at all stations in the outer area but only at principal stations in the inner area, and will be formed of double-deck stock in order to provide more seating for longer journeys.

In September 2014 a study was published for the construction of a new rail tunnel and underground station serving the ETH Hönggerberg &quot;Science City&quot;. The new tunnel would run directly between Hardbrücke and Regensdorf stations, as opposed to the indirect route via the existing Käferberg Tunnel and Oerlikon station that is currently used by service S6.

==Rolling stock==

, Zurich S-Bahn uses the following rolling stock:
* DPZ (, ) trainsets, each with three cars hauled by SBB Re 450 or SZU Re 456 locomotives (115 trainsets)
* SBB CFF FFS RABe 511, four-/six-car bilevel EMUs (50 trainsets)
* SBB CFF FFS RABe 514, also known as DTZ (, ), four-car bilevel EMUs (61 trainsets)
* Refurbished Re 420 LION locomotive-hauled DPZ bilevel coaches (head and tail configuration), used for peak-hour services (15 trainsets)
* SOB Stadler Flirt, four-car single-level EMUs
* Thurbo Stadler GTW, two-/three-car single-level trains
* &quot;KTU&quot; push-pull trainsets, each composed of an SZU Re 456 locomotive and double-deck and single-deck coaches, including one single-deck control car (6 trainsets)
* SZU Be 510 (), three-car single-level EMUs (6 trainsets)
* Stadler ABe 4/8 of AVA operating as S17 service (14 light rail sets)
* Stadler Be 4/6 of &quot;Forchbahn&quot; operating as S18 service (13 light rail sets)

<text>John Lester Hubbard Chafee ( ; October 22, 1922 – October 24, 1999) was an American politician and officer in the United States Marine Corps. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 66th Governor of Rhode Island, as the Secretary of the Navy, and as a United States Senator.

==Early life and family==
Chafee was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to a politically active family. He was the son of Janet Melissa (née Hunter) and John Sharpe Chafee. His great-grandfather, Henry Lippitt, was governor of Rhode Island (1875–1877), and among his great-uncles were a Rhode Island governor, Charles Warren Lippitt, and United States Senator Henry Frederick Lippitt. His uncle, Zechariah Chafee, was a Harvard law professor, and a notable civil libertarian. His cousin was Frederick Lippitt, former House Minority Leader for the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He had two daughters and four sons, one of whom is former Rhode Island Governor and former United States Senator Lincoln Chafee. One of his daughters, Tribbie, died following an accident at a horse show in October 1968 at the age of 14. His eldest child, John H. Chafee, is a UCLA alumnus.

John Chafee graduated from a coeducational primary school, Providence&#x27;s Gordon School, in 1931 and then attended Providence Country Day School. In 1940, he graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. Chafee was an Episcopalian.

==Marine Corps service==
Chafee was in his third year as an undergraduate at Yale University when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He interrupted his undergraduate studies and enlisted in the Marine Corps, spending his 20th birthday fighting on the island of Guadalcanal from August 8 until November 1942, when the First Marine Division was relieved. After receiving his commission as a second lieutenant, he fought in the Battle of Okinawa in the spring of 1945.

Following the war, he received degrees from Yale University in 1947 and Harvard Law School in 1950. At Yale, he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) and Skull and Bones fraternities. In 1951, he was recalled to active service to be a Marine rifle company commander during the Korean War with Dog Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines.

Author James Brady in his memoir of the Korean War and serving as a Marine under Chafee writes: &quot;Nowhere, at any time, did John Chafee serve more nobly than he did as a Marine officer commanding a rifle company in the mountains of North Korea.&quot; and that &quot;He was the only truly great man I&#x27;ve yet met in my life...&quot;

Chafee&#x27;s military awards include three awards of the Presidential Unit Citation, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Korean Service Medal and the United Nations Korea Medal.

==Early political career==

Chafee became active in behind-the-scenes Rhode Island politics by helping elect a mayor of Providence in the early 1950s. He successfully ran for a seat in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1956 and later became the minority leader. He was re-elected in 1958 and 1960, the latter a year when many Republicans were swept from office in his state.

==Governor of Rhode Island==

Chafee was elected governor in 1962, defeating Democratic incumbent John A. Notte Jr. The election was notable for being one of the narrowest in Rhode Island history, Chafee received 50.06% of the vote to Notte&#x27;s 49.94%, winning by a margin of just 0.12%. However, Chafee quickly became popular with both Rhode Island&#x27;s Republicans and Democrats, allowing him to win re-election by margins of almost 2-to-1 in 1964 and 1966. The 1964 victory made Chafee one of the few bright spots in a disastrous year for Republicans nationally; Lyndon Johnson carried the state with an unheard-of 83 percent of the vote.

As governor, Chafee helped create the state&#x27;s public transportation administration as well as what was known as the Green Acres program, a conservation effort. In 1968, he served as chair of the Republican Governors Association. He served as governor until 1969, when he was surprisingly defeated by underdog Democrat Frank Licht. Reasons ascribed for the defeat include the fact that, after running three times on a strong anti-income tax platform, Chafee now said that such a tax was imperative (indeed his anti-tax opponent went on to champion one in 1971); and that he stopped campaigning after his daughter was killed.

==Secretary of the Navy==
He was appointed Secretary of the Navy in 1969 by President Richard Nixon. Chafee&#x27;s tenure as secretary was marked by a willingness to make bold decisions and stand by them. Emblematic of this was his decision to elevate Admiral Elmo Zumwalt as Chief of Naval Operations over 33 more senior officers, and his judicious handling of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; situation, in which North Korean forces, during the previous administration, had boarded and captured a navy intelligence ship. His action as Secretary of the Navy that is most clearly remembered is his disapproval of the recommendation to court martial Commander Lloyd Bucher, the commanding officer of the &quot;Pueblo&quot;, once the release of the crew had been secured. Because it was clear that the guilt clearly rested on the North Koreans and not Bucher or the sailors on the &quot;Pueblo&quot;, Chafee stated that &quot;Bucher and his men have suffered enough&quot;, and that a court martial would only add insult to injury. He served as Secretary of the Navy until 1972, when he resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.

==United States Senator==
After an unsuccessful candidacy for the Senate in 1972 against Democratic incumbent Claiborne Pell, Chafee was elected to that body in 1976 to succeed retiring Democrat John Pastore. He was the first Republican to win a Rhode Island Senate election since 1930. He joined the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in 1977 and made environmental matters a chief concern, often breaking with his party to the delight of conservation groups. He chaired that committee during his last term in office, from 1995 to 1999. As a result of his work, Chafee was a recipient of the Lady Bird Johnson Environmental Award.

Among the bills Chafee fostered while in the minority was the Clean Water Act of 1986, and the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. He also was an architect of the 1980 Superfund program to clean up hazardous waste sites as well as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Chafee authored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982, establishing the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). Upon Chafee&#x27;s death in 1999, the CBRS was renamed the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System.

Like most Republicans from New England, Chafee&#x27;s voting record was moderate to liberal. He was pro-choice on abortion and supported the North American Free Trade Agreement. He took a moderate stance on taxes and government assistance to the needy. He opposed the death penalty, school prayer, and the ban on homosexuals serving in the military. Chafee was one of the few Republicans to support strict gun control laws. He sponsored a bill that, if passed, would have prohibited the &quot;manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, purchase, transfer, receipt, possession, or transportation of handguns and hand ammunition.&quot; Chafee voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Chafee voted in favor of the nomination of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States and the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, but voted against the nomination of Robert Bork.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, Senator Chafee became an advocate for improving the U.S. health care system. He supported legislation to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income children and pregnant women, sponsored legislation to expand the availability of home and community-based services for persons with disabilities, and worked to enact legislation to establish Federally Qualified Health Centers. In 1992, he was appointed chairman of the Senate Republican Task Force on Health, and he worked to develop a consensus among Republicans on health care. In 1993, he joined with Democratic Louisiana Senator John Breaux to form the Senate Mainstream Coalition, a coalition of six Democratic and six Republican senators seeking bipartisan consensus on health reform. He sponsored legislation that increased funds to states to assist youths in making the transition from foster care to independent living; recognized the need for special help for youths ages 18 to 21 who have left foster care; offered states greater flexibility in designing their independent living programs; and, established accountability for states in implementing independent living programs. As a testimonial to the late Senator Chafee, the program is now entitled the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.

Chafee sat on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Health Care, but his biggest imprint was on environmental concerns. He also served in his party&#x27;s leadership, chairing the Senate Republican Conference from 1985 to 1990.

On February 12, 1999, Chafee voted against both articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton.

On March 15, 1999, Chafee announced he would not seek re-election in 2000.

In October 1999, less than two weeks before his death, Chafee was one of four Senate Republicans to vote in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles. His last major act was authoring and sponsoring the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century, which authorized funding for transportation programs for the next six years.

==Death==
On October 24, 1999, around seven months after Chafee announced his retirement from the Senate, he died from heart failure at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, two days after his 77th birthday. President Clinton eulogized him, saying, &quot;He embodied the decent center. For him, civility was not simply a matter of personal manners. He believed it was essential to the preservation of our democratic system.&quot; Chafee was succeeded in the Senate by his son, Lincoln, who went on to win a full term in his own right in 2000.

==Legacy==
The USS &quot;Chafee&quot; (DDG-90), the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor and the John H. Chafee National Wildlife Refuge were named in his honor.

Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island named its World Trade Center on campus after John H. Chafee for his continuing support for global trade and his association with the university.

The Chafee Social Science Center at the University of Rhode Island is named in his honor. It is the tallest building in southern Rhode Island.

The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, passed on November 23, 1999, after his death, is known as the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. The programs are administered at the state level by Social Service Agencies. One such program, in example, is the North Carolina Links program

<doc id="988366" wikidata="Q1249524" url="?curid=988366" title="The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes">
<text>The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes is a short story collection of twelve Sherlock Holmes pastiches, first published in 1954. It was written by Adrian Conan Doyle, who was the son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), and by John Dickson Carr, who was the authorised biographer of the elder Conan Doyle. The first six stories were written in collaboration by the two writers, while the last six stories were written solely by Adrian Conan Doyle.

Each story in this collection is postscripted with a quote from one of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, making reference to an undocumented Holmes case that inspired it.

==Writing==
In 1945, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s son, Adrian Conan Doyle, began a collaboration with his father&#x27;s biographer, John Dickson Carr, to publish twelve new exploits of Sherlock Holmes and Watson (of which one appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine and the other eleven stories were published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine) based on cases that had been referred to in passing in the four canonical novels and 56 original short stories of Sherlock Holmes, but which had never been written up by Watson (see the below mentioned postscripts found at the end of each of the twelve new exploits).

The first story was illustrated by Adolf Hallman in &quot;Life&quot;, and the other stories were illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. In 1954, the collection was published by Random House, New York, with illustrations by Jerome Kuhl and a jacket illustration by Jules Gotlieb. It was published in the same year by John Murray, London.

The collaboration was not smooth, as Douglas G. Greene relates in &quot;John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles&quot;. There is some doubt about who wrote what—though at times Carr&#x27;s highly recognisable style breaks through the convention of pastiching the original Conan Doyle stories. In any case, the book published in 1954 was not a great success at the time, though collectors take an interest in it, and the experiment of writing more new Sherlock Holmes exploits was not repeated by these two writers.

In 1963 John Murray published two paperback volumes which divided the stories into &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Adrian Conan Doyle and &quot;More Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr. The first title contains the last six stories listed below, the second the first six. Greene suggests that authorship may be more complex.

==Stories==
The stories contained in the collection are:
*&quot;The Adventure of the Seven Clocks&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Case of the Trepoff Murder&quot; mentioned in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Gold Hunter&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Camberwell Poisoning Case&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Wax Gamblers&quot; - post-scripted from &quot;The Case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal&quot; mentioned in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; (however, this exploit is not the one mentioned in the Doyle story, but is instead a second one. It does refer to the previous one, though.)
*&quot;The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Tale of Mr. James Phillimore&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Black Baronet&quot; - post-scripted as the affair of &quot;The Unfortunate Madame Montpensier&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Sealed Room&quot; - post-scripted as the case of &quot;Colonel Warburton&#x27;s Madness&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of Foulkes Rath&quot; - post-scripted as the account of &quot;The Addleton Tragedy&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Abbas Ruby&quot; - post-scripted as the affair of &quot;The Famous Card Scandal of the Nonpareil Club&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Dark Angels&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Case of the Ferrers&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Two Women&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Scandal of the Blackmailer&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Deptford Horror&quot; - post-scripted as two cases &quot;The Sudden Death of Cardinal Tosca&quot; and &quot;Wilson the Notorious Canary-trainer&quot; mentioned in &quot;The Adventure of Black Peter&quot;
*&quot;The Adventure of the Red Widow&quot; - post-scripted as &quot;The Arnsworth Castle Business&quot; mentioned in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;

<text>The Peachoid is a tall water tower in Gaffney, South Carolina, U.S., that resembles a peach. The water tower holds one million U.S. gallons (3.78541 million litres) of water and is located off Peachoid Road by Interstate 85 between exits 90 and 92 (near the Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway). Usually referred to by locals as &quot;The Peach&quot; and by passing motorists as &quot;Mr. Peach&quot; or &quot;The Moon over Gaffney&quot;, the water tank is visible for several miles around these exits.

An example of novelty architecture, the Peachoid is one of the most recognizable landmarks for travelers along I-85 between Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.

==History==
The water tower was built in 1981, by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, of steel and concrete. An overlay stem and leaf were laid across the structure, an enormous &quot;cleft&quot; was created with steel paneling, and Peter Freudenberg, an artist who worked with macro-art, painted the structure to realistically resemble a peach. The foundation and sub-contract work was performed by Ford Construction Company of Selma, Alabama.

The Peachoid was commissioned by the Gaffney Board of Public Works, who had a need for elevated water storage and wished to find a way of building it using federal funding. The shape of the peach was selected because the Gaffney economy was then dependent upon peach orchards, and because the people of the town wanted to make clear that South Carolina, and at one time, Cherokee County alone, where Gaffney is located, produced more peaches per year than the entire state of Georgia (known as the &quot;Peach State&quot;). Since its construction, the Peachoid&#x27;s extremely high visibility has introduced an element of tourism to the local economy, and a smaller (500,000 U.S. gallons, 1.9 million liters) peachoid has been built for Clanton, Alabama by the same company.

In February 2018, the Gaffney Board of Public Works installed a 6-foot tall chain-link security fence around the Peachoid in response to years of continued vandalism.

==In popular culture==
The Peachoid was a focal plot point in Chapter 3 of &quot;House of Cards&quot;, where there was concern that the structure resembles female genitalia and/or buttocks. In the episode, Frank Underwood, as a native of Gaffney, keeps a photo of the Peachoid in his office, and it becomes the subject of a political and potentially legal battle for Frank after a young woman dies in a car accident, distracted by the Peachoid.

The Peachoid finds mention in the Gregg Hurwitz novel &quot;Hellbent“, Part 3 of the Orphan X series, when the protagonist Evan Smoak recognizes the landmark on a video feed taken from a crashing helicopter at night. Mistakenly, he travels to Gaffney, not being aware of the second, identical yet smaller version in Clanton, to find clues on the events leading up to the helicopter crash.

<text>Rick Burchett (born March 9, 1952) is an American comic book artist known for his work on such characters as Batman and Superman.

==Career==
Burchett began his artistic career in St. Louis, Missouri, and did his early professional comics work at First Comics, Pacific Comics, Capital Comics, and AC Comics; on titles including &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, &quot;E-Man&quot;, &quot;American Flagg!&quot;, &quot;Great American Western&quot;, and &quot;The Phantom&quot;. Moving to DC Comics (as well as the DC imprints Impact Comics and Vertigo), Burchett&#x27;s first work for the company was on &quot;Blackhawk&quot;, followed by titles like &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Black Hood&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;The Justice League&quot;, and &quot;Green Lantern&quot;.

Around 1985, Burchett and artist Don Secrease met a young aspiring artist and fellow St. Louis citizen named Jim Lee, and convinced him that he needed to show his portfolio to editors in person, prompting Lee&#x27;s decision to attend a New York comics convention, where he met editor Archie Goodwin.

Burchett received the Eisner Award in 1996 with Paul Dini and Ty Templeton for his work on &quot;The Batman and Robin Adventures&quot;. He shared the Eisner Award again in 1999, with Templeton and Terry Beatty, for his work on &quot;&quot;.

In 2006 he became the ongoing penciller on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;She-Hulk&quot; with writer and former &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; collaborator Dan Slott. As of 2011, he is the artist for &quot;The All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold&quot;, the comic book tie-in to the &quot;&quot; animated television series. Also in 2011, Burchett became the artist for the ongoing webcomic &quot;Lady Sabre and the Pirates of the Ineffable Aether&quot;, written by Greg Rucka. In 2017, he rejoined Ty Templeton in creating a new DC digital comic, &quot;Harley Quinn and Batman&quot;.

In 2017 Burchett replaced Chuck Ayers as the penciller on the syndicated comic strip &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;, debuting with the May 25 installment.

==Personal life==
Burchett continues to live in the St. Louis area.

<doc id="988372" wikidata="Q816838" url="?curid=988372" title="Far side of the Moon">
<text>The far side of the Moon is the lunar hemisphere that always faces away from Earth, opposite to the near side, because of synchronous rotation in the Moon&#x27;s orbit. Compared to the near side, the far side&#x27;s terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat and dark lunar maria (&quot;seas&quot;), giving it an appearance closer to other barren places in the Solar System such as Mercury and Callisto. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South Pole–Aitken basin. The hemisphere has sometimes been called the &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot;, where &quot;dark&quot; means &quot;unknown&quot; instead of &quot;lacking sunlight&quot; each location on the Moon experiences two weeks of sunlight while the opposite location experiences night.

About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to oscillation and to libration. The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959, when it was photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe. The Soviet Academy of Sciences published the first atlas of the far side in 1960. The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first humans to see the far side in person when they orbited the Moon in 1968. All crewed and uncrewed soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon, until January 3, 2019, when the Chang&#x27;e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side. The Chang&#x27;e 6 sample-return mission was launched on May 3, 2024, landed in the Apollo basin in the southern hemisphere of the lunar far side and returned to Earth a month later on June 25 with humanity&#x27;s first lunar samples retrieved from the far side.

Astronomers have suggested installing a large radio telescope on the far side, where the Moon would shield it from possible radio interference from Earth.

== Definition ==

Tidal forces from Earth have slowed the Moon&#x27;s rotation to the point where the same side is always facing the Earth—a phenomenon called tidal locking. The other face, most of which is never visible from the Earth, is therefore called the &quot;far side of the Moon&quot;. Over time, some crescent-shaped edges of the far side can be seen due to libration. In total, 59 percent of the Moon&#x27;s surface is visible from Earth at one time or another. Useful observation of the parts of the far side of the Moon occasionally visible from Earth is difficult because of the low viewing angle from Earth (they cannot be observed &quot;full on&quot;).

A common misconception is that the Moon does not rotate on its axis. If that were so, the whole of the Moon would be visible to Earth over the course of its orbit. Instead, its rotation period matches its orbital period, meaning it turns around once for every orbit it makes: in Earth terms, it could be said that its day and its year have the same length (i.e., ~29.5 earth days).

The phrase &quot;dark side of the Moon&quot; does not refer to &quot;dark&quot; as in the absence of light, but rather &quot;dark&quot; as in unknown: until humans were able to send spacecraft around the Moon, this area had never been seen. In reality, both the near and far sides receive (on average) almost equal amounts of light directly from the Sun. This symmetry is complicated by sunlight reflected from the Earth onto the near side (earthshine), and by lunar eclipses, which occur only when the far side is already dark. Lunar eclipses mean that the side facing earth receives fractionally less sunlight than the far side when considered over a long period of time.

At night under a &quot;full Earth&quot; the near side of the Moon receives on the order of 10 lux of illumination (about what a city sidewalk under streetlights gets; this is 34 times more light than is received on Earth under a full Moon) whereas the far side of the Moon during the lunar night receives only about 0.001 lux of starlight. Only during a full Moon (as viewed from Earth) is the whole far side of the Moon dark.

The word &quot;dark&quot; has expanded to refer also to the fact that communication with spacecraft can be blocked while the spacecraft is on the far side of the Moon, during Apollo space missions for example.

==Differences==
The two hemispheres of the Moon have dramatically different appearances, with the near side covered in multiple, large &quot;maria&quot; (Latin for &#x27;seas&#x27;, since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of lunar water).
The far side has a battered, densely cratered appearance with few maria. Only 1% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria, compared to 31.2% on the near side. One commonly accepted explanation for this difference is related to a higher concentration of heat-producing elements on the near-side hemisphere, as has been demonstrated by geochemical maps obtained from the Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer. While other factors, such as surface elevation and crustal thickness, could also affect where basalts erupt, these do not explain why the far side South Pole–Aitken basin (which contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and possesses a thin crust) was not as volcanically active as Oceanus Procellarum on the near side.

It has also been proposed that the differences between the two hemispheres may have been caused by a collision with a smaller companion moon that also originated from the Theia collision. In this model, the impact led to an accretionary pile rather than a crater, contributing a hemispheric layer of extent and thickness that may be consistent with the dimensions of the far side highlands. The chemical composition of the far side is inconsistent with this model.

The far side has more visible craters. This is thought to be a result of the effects of lunar lava flows, which cover and obscure craters, rather than a shielding effect from the Earth. NASA calculates that the Earth obscures only about 4 square degrees out of 41,000 square degrees of the sky as seen from the Moon. &quot;This makes the Earth negligible as a shield for the Moon [and] it is likely that each side of the Moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though both sides have received the same number of impacts.&quot;

Newer research suggests that heat from Earth at the time when the Moon was formed is the reason the near side has fewer impact craters. The lunar crust consists primarily of plagioclases formed when aluminium and calcium condensed and combined with silicates in the mantle. The cooler far side experienced condensation of these elements sooner and so formed a thicker crust; meteoroid impacts on the near side would sometimes penetrate the thinner crust here and release basaltic lava that created the maria, but would rarely do so on the far side.

The far side exhibits more extreme variations in terrain elevation than the near side. The Moon&#x27;s highest and lowest points, along with its tallest mountains measured from base to peak, are all located on the far side.

==Exploration==
===Early exploration===


Until the late 1950s, little was known about the far side of the Moon. Librations periodically allowed limited glimpses of features near the lunar limb on the far side, but only up to 59% of the total surface of the Moon. These features were seen from a low angle, hindering useful observation (it proved difficult to distinguish a crater from a mountain range). The remaining 82% of the surface on the far side remained unknown, and its properties were subject to much speculation.

An example of a far side feature that can be seen through libration is the Mare Orientale, which is a prominent impact basin spanning almost , yet this was not even named as a feature until 1906, by Julius Franz in &quot;Der Mond&quot;. The true nature of the basin was discovered in the 1960s when rectified images were projected onto a globe. The basin was photographed in fine detail by Lunar Orbiter 4 in 1967. Before space exploration began, astronomers expected that the far side would be similar to the side visible to Earth. 

On 7 October 1959, the Soviet probe Luna 3 took the first photographs of the lunar far side, eighteen of them resolvable, covering one-third of the surface invisible from the Earth. The images were analysed, and the first atlas of the far side of the Moon was published by the USSR Academy of Sciences on 6 November 1960. It included a catalog of 500 distinguished features of the landscape. In 1961, the first globe (1: scale) containing lunar features invisible from the Earth was released in the USSR, based on images from Luna 3. 

On 20 July 1965, another Soviet probe, Zond 3, transmitted 25 pictures of very good quality of the lunar far side, with much better resolution than those from Luna 3. In particular, they revealed chains of craters, hundreds of kilometers in length, but, unexpectedly, no mare plains like those visible from Earth with the naked eye. In 1967, the second part of the &quot;Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon&quot; was published in Moscow, based on data from Zond 3, with the catalog now including 4,000 newly discovered features of the lunar far side landscape. In the same year, the first &quot;Complete Map of the Moon&quot; (1: scale) and updated complete globe (1: scale), featuring 95 percent of the lunar surface, were released in the Soviet Union.

As many prominent landscape features of the far side were discovered by Soviet space probes, Soviet scientists selected names for them. This caused some controversy, though the Soviet Academy of Sciences selected many non-Soviet names, including Jules Verne, Marie Curie and Thomas Edison. The International Astronomical Union later accepted many of the names.

===Further survey mission===

On 26 April 1962, NASA&#x27;s Ranger 4 space probe became the first spacecraft to impact the far side of the Moon, although it failed to return any scientific data before impact.

The first truly comprehensive and detailed mapping survey of the far side was undertaken by the American uncrewed Lunar Orbiter program launched by NASA from 1966 to 1967. Most of the coverage of the far side was provided by the final probe in the series, Lunar Orbiter 5.

The far side was first seen directly by human eyes during the Apollo 8 mission in December, 1968. Astronaut William Anders described the view:

It has been seen by all 24 men who flew on Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 through Apollo 17, and photographed by multiple lunar probes. Spacecraft passing behind the Moon were out of direct radio communication with the Earth, and had to wait until the orbit allowed transmission. During the Apollo missions, the main engine of the Service Module was fired when the vessel was behind the Moon, producing some tense moments in Mission Control before the craft reappeared.

Geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt, who became the last to step onto the Moon, had aggressively lobbied for Apollo 17&#x27;s landing site to be on the far side of the Moon, targeting the lava-filled crater Tsiolkovskiy. Schmitt&#x27;s ambitious proposal included a special communications satellite based on the existing TIROS satellites to be launched into a Farquhar–Lissajous halo orbit around the L2 point so as to maintain line-of-sight contact with the astronauts during their powered descent and lunar surface operations. NASA administrators rejected these plans on the grounds of added risk and lack of funding.

The idea of utilizing Earth–Moon for communications satellite covering the Moon&#x27;s far side has been realized, as China National Space Administration launched Queqiao relay satellite in 2018. It has since been used for communications between the Chang&#x27;e 4 lander and Yutu 2 rover that have successfully landed in early 2019 on the lunar far side and ground stations on the Earth. L2 is proposed to be &quot;an ideal location&quot; for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.

===Soft landing===
The China National Space Administration (CNSA)&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 achieved humanity&#x27;s first ever soft landing on the lunar far side on 3 January 2019 and deployed the Yutu-2 lunar rover onto the lunar surface.

The craft included a lander equipped with a low-frequency radio spectrograph and geological research tools. The far side of the Moon provides a good environment for radio astronomy as interferences from the Earth are blocked by the Moon.

In February 2020, Chinese astronomers reported, for the first time, a high-resolution image of a lunar ejecta sequence, as well as direct analysis of its internal architecture. These were based on observations made by the Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) on board the Yutu-2 rover.

CNSA launched Chang&#x27;e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon. It was CNSA&#x27;s second lunar sample return mission, the first achieved by Chang&#x27;e 5 from the lunar near side four years earlier. It also carried a mini &quot;Jinchan&quot; rover to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged the Chang&#x27;e 6&#x27;s lander on the lunar surface. The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024 at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon&#x27;s surface on 1 June 2024. The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024 at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, and later completed another robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed in Inner Mongolia on 25 June 2024, completing China&#x27;s far side sample return mission.

The Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment (LuSEE-Night) lander, a mission to soft land as early as 2026 a robotic observatory on the far side designed to measure electromagnetic waves from the early history of the universe is being developed by NASA and the United States Department of Energy.


==Potential uses and missions==
Because the far side of the Moon is shielded from radio transmissions from the Earth, it is considered a good location for placing radio telescopes for use by astronomers. Small, bowl-shaped craters provide a natural formation for a stationary telescope similar to Arecibo in Puerto Rico. For much larger-scale telescopes, the crater Daedalus is situated near the center of the far side, and the rim would help to block stray communications from orbiting satellites. Another potential candidate for a radio telescope is the Saha crater.

Before deploying radio telescopes to the far side, several problems must be overcome. The fine lunar dust can contaminate equipment, vehicles, and space suits. The conducting materials used for the radio dishes must also be carefully shielded against the effects of solar flares. Finally, the area around the telescopes must be protected against contamination by other radio sources.

The Lagrange point of the Earth–Moon system is located about above the far side, which has also been proposed as a location for a future radio telescope which would perform a Lissajous orbit about the Lagrangian point.

One of the NASA missions to the Moon under study would send a sample-return lander to the South Pole–Aitken basin, the location of a major impact event that created a formation nearly across. The force of this impact has created a deep penetration into the lunar surface, and a sample returned from this site could be analyzed for information concerning the interior of the Moon.

Because the near side is partly shielded from the solar wind by the Earth, the far side maria are expected to have the highest concentration of helium-3 on the surface of the Moon. This isotope is relatively rare on the Earth, but has good potential for use as a fuel in fusion reactors. Proponents of lunar settlement have cited the presence of this material as a reason for developing a Moon base.

<doc id="988381" wikidata="Q2076468" url="?curid=988381" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">
<text>Soundwave is a fictional robot character appearing in various &quot;Transformers&quot; continuity lines within the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. His most well-known disguise is that of a micro cassette recorder. Throughout most of his incarnations, he is an underlying loyal lieutenant of the Decepticon leader Megatron. He is commonly depicted as Megatron&#x27;s communications officer and in some interpretations, only speaks when mocking the Autobots.

==Transformers: Generation 1==
Soundwave is one of the characters from the original Transformers line. His alternate mode is a microcassette recorder and he has a distinctive monotone, computerized voice.

Soundwave is able to detect and jam transmissions across the entire energy spectrum, a talent that makes him suited to his position as a Decepticon Communications Officer. Additionally, he has a photographic memory on account of the data storage capacity of the magnetic disks in his chest compartment, and he is armed with a shoulder-mounted laser cannon and hand-held concussion blaster. Soundwave is physically strong compared to most Transformers. His alternative form is that of an Earthly microcassette deck. Within the tape compartment, which becomes his chest in robot mode, he stores a variety of Decepticon spies, all of which take the alternative form of a microcassette. These spy characters include Ravage, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw, Ratbat, Rumble, Frenzy, Slugfest, Wingthing, Autoscout and Overkill, all of whom are under Soundwave&#x27;s command in the original television series. Squawktalk and Beastbox were additional cassette characters under Soundwave&#x27;s control within the US toyline, who never appeared in the cartoon.

Soundwave&#x27;s cassettes are quick to serve and defend Soundwave in a crisis, and generally relate to him as servants or even pets. However, when his cassette Ratbat became leader of the Decepticons in the Marvel Comics series, Soundwave fully shifted his trademark loyalty from Megatron to him. In the Dreamwave comics, Ratbat led the Ultracons faction, while Soundwave remained with the Decepticons led by Shockwave, although within that continuity these events occurred before Ratbat took up a cassette form. In the IDW comics, on pre-war Cybertron, Soundwave functioned as a personal assistant to Ratbat, who was a Senator at the time, however, Soundwave&#x27;s true loyalty was with Megatron. When the time came for him and Starscream to massacre the Senate, he enslaved Ratbat by bestowing the smaller, weaker cassette body upon him.

===Animated series===
In the original &quot;Transformers&quot; cartoon, Soundwave was Megatron&#x27;s most reliable aide, frequently sent on important reconnaissance missions with his cassettes, and often playing a key role in many schemes against the Autobots. On Cybertron, he used his ability to transform into a lamp-post to spy on the Autobot city of Iacon, learning of the Autobots&#x27; plan to search for energy on other worlds. Soundwave participated in Megatron&#x27;s assault on the Autobots&#x27; spacecraft, the Ark, and met the same fate as the other occupants when the ship crashed on prehistoric Earth, leaving everyone trapped in stasis. After awakening on Earth in 1984, Soundwave played a crucial part in generating energon cubes and devising strategies to construct a new spacecraft for the Decepticons to journey back to Cybertron.

Later, he used his mind-reading talents to acquire an antimatter formula for the Decepticons from the brain of Chip Chase. He and his cassette minions were often on spying missions against the Autobots.

One of Soundwave&#x27;s most notable misadventures came in season 2 when, operating a plan conceived by Starscream, he brainwashed humans with ultrasonic vibrations, leading to a confrontation with his Autobot Communications Officer counterpart, Blaster, and to a lasting rivalry between the two.

Soundwave rarely displayed much emotion, infrequently exhibiting any traits that could be considered to be in line with his tech spec. However, he showed distress when one of his cassettes were hurt in battle, and he always came across as extremely loyal to Megatron, even going so far as to recover his body after being beaten close to death by Optimus Prime at the battle of Autobot City in 2005 (&quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;). But while Soundwave was loyal, he was far from outspoken, and he kept silent when Megatron&#x27;s body was subsequently ejected into space, and, although he did suggest himself as a replacement leader (&quot;Soundwave: superior, Constructicons: inferior.&quot;), Soundwave again loyally served Megatron when he was reformatted as Galvatron.

In season 3, although operating in a less prominent capacity for most of the time, Soundwave played a prominent role in Galvatron&#x27;s attempt to learn the secret of a sonic weapon on the planet Eurythma, where sound and music were the way of life, leaving Soundwave entranced by the planet&#x27;s perfect melodies. Recording each piece of the harmony that formed the devastating sonic effect, Soundwave was defeated when the Eurythmans countered the harmony with white noise, and was again pulled into a confrontation with Blaster, who erased his recordings.

Soundwave made his final appearance in the American cartoon series, the Season 3 finale, &quot;The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 1&quot; as he was only seen giving the latest piece of information gathered by Ratbat that two scientists had discovered Optimus Prime&#x27;s body, a fact which made Galvatron eager to destroy it once and for all. Although Soundwave only appeared as a background character in the American cartoon series finale, the three-part &quot;The Rebirth&quot;, he returned to the forefront in the new Japanese-exclusive series, &quot;&quot;, which was created to replace &quot;The Rebirth&quot;. Reborn as Soundblaster (New Soundwave in the English version and Vizar in Italy) Soundwave&#x27;s new toy incarnation was, like the series, available only in Japan.

In the 1987 anime robot superhero TV series &quot;&quot;, Soundwave and Blaster&#x27;s rivalry had increased dramatically. In the opening cut and thrust of &quot;Headmasters&quot;, Soundwave and Blaster engaged in their final clash in the Arctic Circle as the Autobots and Decepticons were in the process of searching for the missing Autobot Matrix of Leadership. The two opponents inflicted fatal damage to each other, and Soundwave&#x27;s body exploded even as Blaster collapsed. Soundwave&#x27;s fragments were recovered by his cassettes. Using reconstructive technology from the planet Master, the leader of the Decepticon Headmasters, Zarak, successfully rebuilt and resurrected Soundwave and renamed him Soundblaster—essentially identical to his former self, except for his predominantly black color scheme. As Soundblaster, he served the same role as he had as Soundwave under the leadership of Galvatron and later Scorponok, frequently embarking on spying missions with Ratbat. In &quot;Headmasters&quot;, his character was somewhat changed to have more of a father-son relationship with the cassettes, as it was hinted on his resurrection as Soundblaster.

Soundwave was performed by Frank Welker, whose voice was heavily modulated by a vocoder to achieve Soundwave&#x27;s distinctive, metallic monotone. However, Welker&#x27;s voice was left unmodulated at certain points during the episodes &quot;Roll for It&quot; and &quot;Webworld&quot; due to production errors. This left him sounding like Dr. Claw, another role Welker performed, from &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;.

===Comics===

====3H Enterprises====
Soundwave also appeared in the Furman written &quot;Reaching the Omega Point&quot;, as one of the Transformers legends (alongside Optimus Prime, Megatron and Grimlock) who came to the aid of the forces of Optimus Primal against the Predacon/Unicron hybrid Shokaract, distracting him long enough for Primus to deal the fatal blow.

====Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing====
In Devil&#x27;s Due&#x27;s run of &quot;G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers&quot; comic book miniseries, Soundwave was among the Transformers captured by the ruthless terrorist Cobra Organization, when they discovered the Ark. Refitted by Destro, Soundwave was intended to become a battlefield communications station, but when he and the other Decepticons eventually broke free of their control he was damaged in a battle with the Autobots and his parts were captured by the US Government for study. From his data banks, the android SerpentO.R. downloaded information on the history of Cybertron, using it to further investigate the Decepticon goal of conquest. It is indicated that his pre-Earth form was similar to his Dreamwave&#x27;s War Within form.

====Dreamwave Productions====
In Dreamwave&#x27;s 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 continuity, Soundwave was recruited to the Decepticons 9 million years ago through Megatron&#x27;s underground gladiatorial games, and made head of communications. When a new Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, was chosen, Soundwave was sent along with Ravagge and the Insecticons, to attempt to kill him and recover the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Megatron, but they failed, forcing Megatron to confront Optimus personally.

Even in the face of failures such as this, and later the loss of Megatron in an early space bridge experiment, Soundwave&#x27;s loyalty to the Decepticon cause never wavered, as he remained true to the faction under Shockwave&#x27;s leadership.

As in most other continuities, the story continues in the traditional manner, with Soundwave a member of the &quot;Nemesis&quot; crew who attacked the &quot;Ark&quot; and was sent into stasis when the craft crashed on Earth, awakening again in 1984. After years of fighting on Earth, eventually the combined forces of the Autobots and their human allies were able to defeat and capture the Decepticons. The intent was for the Autobots to take their enemies back to Cybertron aboard a new craft named the &quot;Ark II&quot;, but just as the ship cleared the atmosphere, it exploded, the victim of machinations by Shockwave, who did not want Prime and Megatron to return to Cybertron yet.

Soundwave&#x27;s body crashed back to Earth in the Arctic, where he remained inactive for several years, until rogue military scientist Adam Rook, calling himself &quot;Lazarus&quot;, recovered and reactivated him, putting him under his control with a program he had developed while studying the Transformers before their explosive departure. Several other Autobots and Decepticons fell to the same fate, and were to be sold on the black market. Soundwave himself was put on display by being sent to attack the Smitco Oil Refinery alongside several other Transformers — but when Megatron liberated himself, Soundwave was soon freed by his leader and assumed his position at his side.

When Shockwave arranged for the capture and extradition of Prime and Megatron&#x27;s forces as war criminals, Soundwave was among the captives, but when Starscream jettisoned Megatron into space on the return trip to Cybertron, Soundwave made the best of a bad lot and teamed with Starscream to return to Earth and conquer it, being reunited with Ratbat in the process. Heading back to Earth in a kidnapped Sky Lynx and with the Combaticons now added to their ranks, the Decepticons attacked the &quot;Ark&quot; in hopes of acquiring parts to make the &quot;Nemesis&quot; spaceworthy again, however Soundwave, Skywarp and Thundercracker were defeated and thrown in the &quot;Ark&quot;&#x27;s brig. When the Combaticons, combined as Bruticus, laid into the vessel, they were freed.

It was not much later that the surviving Megatron made contact with Soundwave from space, and Soundwave was all too willing to return to his service, setting up Starscream to fall before Megatron when he returned. And return, Megatron did— but the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of Dreamwave&#x27; left the rest of the story untold.

Soundwave also appeared in the Dreamwave&#x27; Transformers/G.I. Joe series as one of the Decepticons uncovered by Cobra at the start of World War II. Transforming into a radio, he was deactivated at the series&#x27; end by Grimlock. Although Dreamwave&#x27;s collapse precluded the completion of the second series, released art and information revealed that Soundwave would have been involved in the conclusion of that series.

====Fun Publications====
Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). Megatron survived the crash of the Ark on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads Astrotrain, Laserbeak, Ramjet, Ravage, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod). When the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly, Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.

Soundwave was among Megatron&#x27;s troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.

====IDW Publishing====
Soundwave&#x27;s first chronological appearance in the rebooted IDW Publishing Generation One universe was in the prequel miniseries, &quot;The Transformers: Megatron Origin&quot;. In the story, Soundwave works for Senator Ratbat, who takes an interest in the rising gladiator, Megatron. Ratbat sends Soundwave to offer weaponry to Megatron and his followers. Soundwave also assists Megatron with the interrogation of Autobot soldier Bumper. Soundwave is later jailed along with Megatron and others when Sentinel Prime&#x27;s forces capture them, but is released by Ratbat. When Megatron&#x27;s plan is sprung, Soundwave helps Starscream massacre the Autobot Senate. He later confronts Ratbat and forcibly extracts his Spark for implantation in one of his Cassette bodies. Soundwave&#x27;s alternate mode appears to be a communication vehicle with tank treads.

Sometime later, Soundwave was part of the conference of scientists called by Thunderwing in &quot;The Transformers: Stormbringer&quot;, where he refused to accept Thunderwing&#x27;s findings that Cybertron was dying. During around the same time period he had Beachcomber captured and implanted with a cerebro-shell, having the unwilling traitor eject his opposite number Blaster into space (in &quot;Spotlight Blaster&quot;) in order to demoralize the Autobots prior to a Decepticon offensive.

Soundwave&#x27;s story was later continued in his own &quot;Spotlight&quot; one-shot, where he was a self-serving and duplicitous Decepticon internal affairs agent. Soundwave was dispatched by Megatron to keep an eye on Bludgeon&#x27;s investigation of Shockwave&#x27;s lab. However, he kept quiet about Bludgeon&#x27;s obsession with the Regenesis project, thinking he could turn it to his advantage. Following him to Earth in 1984, Soundwave monitored Bludgeon&#x27;s attempts to harvest Ultra Energon and confronted him after he&#x27;d acquired it. Horrified to discover they were not planning to use it in a power-play but instead to reanimate Thunderwing (who previously devastated Cybertron), Soundwave attempted to stop them but was trapped in stasis-lock in cassette player mode. It was revealed in the epilogue that two young humans considered buying him at a pawn shop in 2007.

In &quot;The Transformers: Escalation&quot; #1, Optimus stated that there was evidence that Soundwave had been present in Earth&#x27;s history. Despite this, he did not reappear until issue #4 of &quot;The Transformers: Devastation&quot; where, still trapped in cassette player mode, he interfered with Skywatch&#x27;s control of Laserbeak and Ravage.

Soundwave also appeared as one of the Decepticon forces serving under Starscream in the out-of-continuity &quot;The Transformers: Evolutions&quot; tale &quot;Hearts of Steel&quot;. He appeared as one of Starscream&#x27;s lieutenants. He was presumably destroyed when John Henry and Bumblebee diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a chasm.

====Marvel Comics====
Like much of the original 1984 cast of Decepticons, Soundwave played a much smaller role in the Marvel book series than he did in the cartoon. He quietly and efficiently served loyally, first under Megatron (even sending Ravage and the Insecticons to derail talks between the Autobots and Ronald Reagan at one point in the 1985 Transformers UK annual), then under Shockwave, attacking an aerospace construction plant whose facilities were used to build the Constructicons, who then built a massive radio dish that Soundwave used to beam a message back to Cybertron.

Continuing to operate under Shockwave, Soundwave then moved to serving Ratbat, and co-led the defense of Buenos Aires against the Underbase-empowered Starscream alongside Fortress Maximus, only to wind up being deactivated by the villain.

Unlike many of the others deactivated by Starscream, Soundwave would appear again under Scorponok&#x27;s command. Throughout the U.S. comic, Soundwave was colored purple instead of his more trademark blue, and additionally was frequently drawn with a visible mouth.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in the UK, a sister title to the American series was also in production. It reprinted the American stories, but as it was released on a weekly (as opposed to monthly) schedule, it soon began to run out of material to reprint. It opted to create its own original stories at that point, which deftly weaved in and out of the ongoing American storyline. Under writer Simon Furman, Soundwave - coloured blue - was a fairly major player, portrayed in a manner much more consistent with his profile - that of a manipulator and blackmailer, reading others&#x27; minds and using their secrets to his own ends, always working towards his own goals.

When Megatron and Shockwave were both briefly believed deceased, he assumed leadership of the Decepticons during Optimus Prime&#x27;s &quot;Crisis of Command&quot; and then the &quot;Dinobot Hunt&quot; story arcs, manipulating events to weaken the Autobot leadership and cause maximum casualties. When the two commanders returned and vied for leadership of the Decepticons, he turned the situation to his own advantage by working both sides of the field. He also enjoyed a rare victory in this period when he, Dirge and Kickback took over a NASA complex in an attempt to contact Cybertron with the facility&#x27;s deep space radio equipment. The Autobots arrived, but a series of miscommunications between Prowl and Jetfire resulted in the transmission being sent, allowing the Decepticons to claim victory.

Towards the end of the UK series, a storyline began which separated from the regular ongoing American continuity, covering the exploits of the proactive Autobot &quot;Earthforce&quot;. In these stories, Soundwave sold Decepticon secrets to both the Autobots and Shockwave&#x27;s group of Decepticons. Wildrider was blamed for this intelligence leak, and Soundwave silently allowed him to be killed rather than be discovered. After Starscream successfully removed Megatron and Shockwave from power, he and Soundwave entered into joined leadership of the Decepticons.

Issue #279 of the Marvel UK Transformers comic featured a story called &quot;Divide and Conquer!&quot; where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.

Soundwave attained leadership of the Decepticons in the future world of 2008, following the death of Shockwave (who had seized power when Galvatron traveled back in time). Soundwave led his era&#x27;s Decepticons back to 1989 to participate in the Time Wars when the fabric of reality began to crumble, but as the conflict came to a head they fled back to their own time. Since it was later established that the damage done to the time stream may have resulted in their future being erased from the timeline, the final fate of the future Soundwave is unknown.

Soundwave returned to the pages of the US &quot;Transformers&quot; comic books for the relaunch of the series as &quot;&quot;. He participated in the Decepticon attack on Earth, and oversaw the reconstruction of the damaged Darkwing into a new, more powerful form.

Like many of the other Generation 1 Decepticons, Soundwave seemed to return to a command position on Megatron&#x27;s return (killing Bludgeon in the process).

Soundwave made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel &quot;Generation 2&quot; comic series, in a story called &quot;New Dawn.&quot; Megatron lead his Decepticons against Jhiaxus&#x27; second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.

He was aboard the Warworld when Jhiaxus&#x27; forces attacked, but managed to evacuate. His fate within the Generation 2 comic series beyond this point is unknown.

Soundwave would also play a brief but important role in the text-only novel &quot;Alignment&quot;, writer Simon Furman&#x27;s take on what happened after the &quot;&quot; comic series ended. He was the one who recovered Megatron&#x27;s broken body after his duel with Galvatron. Subsequently, he was the ringleader of the conspirators (along with Ravage, Ramjet and Direwolf) who gave some of their spark energy to resurrect Megatron in a more powerful body, allowing him to defeat the forces of the Liege Maximo. After Megatron executes the Decepticon High Council save Shrapnel, Soundwave once again acted as Megatron&#x27;s second in command and coordinated the strike against the Maximo with Ultra Magnus. His fate beyond this point is unknown, save for a brief cameo in &quot;Beast Machines&quot;.

Soundwave as depicted in the Marvel Universe tends to be the most intellectual and philosophical of the Decepticons. He is appalled by the barbarity of Megatron and Shockwave battling in hand-to-hand combat for leadership of the Decepticons, especially as the entire spectacle is being broadcast on live television for human entertainment by Robo-Master. When the future Autobots and Decepticons join forces and repel an alien invasion of Cybertron he begins to propose a lasting truce to Ultra Magnus but stops himself, observing that too much has occurred between the 2 factions and their differences are irreconcilable.

====TFcon comics====
Soundwave appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play &quot;Bee for, Bee now&quot;.

===Other appearances===
A parody of the &quot;Generation 1&quot; Transformers was aired in the December 23, 2008 episode of &quot;Frank TV&quot;, called &quot;Frank the Halls&quot;. In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.

Soundwave appears in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Toy Meets Girl&quot;, voiced by Seth Green. He is portrayed as having retired from the Decepticon army and obtained honest employment as a transformable portable toilet. Frank Welker reprises his role of Soundwave (as well as Megatron but not Rumble) when he appears again in another &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Werewolf vs. Unicorn&quot; where in the current years it&#x27;s revealed that because the audio cassette tape and cassette players have long become obsolete and therefore no longer widely used, his spy tactics now do not work (the people who discovered him in the skit were laughing at his mixtape which was Rumble being killed by them puling his tape out). He is later found by Megatron and Shockwave to be on sale on eBay with options to place a bid for 500 dollars or &quot;Buy it now&quot; for 1000 dollars, whereupon Shockwave exclaims &quot;Request permission to buy it now!&quot; The Commemorative Soundwave figure was used in &quot;Werewolf vs. Unicorn&quot;.

Soundwave made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Courtship of Stewie&#x27;s Father&quot; as Peter&#x27;s new supervisor. In it, Soundwave releases a framed photograph from his cassette deck cavity, of himself and a human woman named Denise, who Soundwave proclaims is his wife, whom he met in a Christian chat room. Soundwave also appears in the &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; episode &quot;Hail, Squishface&quot; as a toy on an Asian girl&#x27;s cart, who sells Capt. Murphy Gloop, from the show &quot;The Herculoids&quot;.

A music video featuring Soundwave and a robot similar to Rumble and Frenzy named Lazer (though purely white in colour) breakdancing has surfaced throughout the Internet since 2000. The video contains audio clips from both the animated series and &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; alongside music.

In 2007, shortly before the release of the live-action &quot;Transformers&quot; film, Soundwave appeared in the viral comedy short &quot;Soundwave: The Touch.&quot;

===Toys===
* &quot;Generation 1&quot; Soundwave (1984)
:The original Soundwave toy (and his cassettes) began as part of Takara&#x27;s Micro Change line, designed by Satoshi Koizumi, featuring household objects that transformed into accurately-scaled robots. Incorporated into the &quot;Transformers&quot; toy line by Hasbro, the figure was packaged with Buzzsaw in the US, and with Rumble in Japan (also including a set of non-functional headphones). The tapes could fit into Soundwave&#x27;s opening chest door (released by a push of his shoulder-mounted &quot;eject&quot; button), while the interaction level was maintained by his two guns, which turned into AA-sized batteries that could be stored in a compartment on his back. Cassette tapes that could interact with Soundwave were released regularly until 1988. The Soundwave toy was reissued in Japan in 2004, and in the U.S. in 2006 using the Soundblaster mold.
* &quot;Generation 1&quot; Soundblaster (1987)
:A re-mold of the Soundwave toy exclusive to Japan, Soundblaster is cast in black plastic where Soundwave was blue, with a retooled chest door, now made of translucent red plastic and able to hold two cassettes at once. Soundblaster came with a variant edition of Buzzsaw, who had a special sticker on his body that, when viewed through Soundblaster&#x27;s door, would reveal the weak spots of Fortress Maximus. Soundblaster was reissued in Japan in 2005.
* &quot;Generation 1&quot; Action Master Soundwave (1990)
:The non-transforming Action Master incarnation of Soundwave came packaged with a transforming partner named Wingthing, who could become a gun for Soundwave to wield.
* &quot;Generation 2&quot; Go-Bot Soundwave (1995)
:The Marvel Comics &quot;Generation 2&quot; series concluded before it could feature the Generation 2 toy line&#x27;s new, distinctly different version of Soundwave from 1995 - a fluorescent yellow, blue and pink Ford Thunderbird stock car Go-Bot, a re-deco of an earlier figure named Gearhead. The figure was later recolored into W.A.R.S. for &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Generation 2&quot; Laser Cycle Soundwave (unreleased)
:Plans existed to repaint the Laser Cycle, Road Pig, into a version of Soundwave featuring his classic color scheme, but the figure was never released.
* &quot;Machine Wars&quot; Soundwave (1997)
:1997&#x27;s Machine Wars toy line, released exclusively in KB Toy stores, featured Soundwave as a repaint of the 1992 European- and Canadian-exclusive figure Stalker. The toy transforms into a missile tank and, colored in shades of black, gray and maroon, resembles Soundwave only through a similar head sculpt, and a shoulder-mounted weapon, in this case, an electron rocket. His tech spec, however, was clearly based on that of the original Soundwave toy&#x27;s, with an additional mention of a new nickname for this version of the character: &quot;The Terror Tank.&quot;
* &quot;Transtech&quot; Soundwave (unreleased)
:With the conclusion of the &quot;Beast Machines&quot; toy line, the initial plan for a follow-up was through the futuristic &quot;Transtech&quot; series. Although the idea was scrapped in favor of &quot;&quot;, Toronto-based design studio Draxhall Jump produced several designs for characters, including Soundwave.
* &quot;Smallest Transformers&quot; Soundwave with Jaguar (2003)
:Part of the first wave of the Japan-only &quot;Smallest Transformers&quot; toy line. Despite the small size (roughly 2 inches in robot height), the toy is virtually faithful to the original G1 toy in design and transformation. Soundwave also comes with a micro cassette that transforms into Ravage.
:In 2006, this toy was to be released with a redeco of &quot;Energon&quot; Megatron as a Target exclusive in the U.S., but plans to release the toy were canceled.
* &quot;Universe&quot; Soundwave with Space Case (2004)
:A redeco of Soundwave&#x27;s &quot;Machine Wars&quot; figure, this toy was rendered in shades of blue and yellow, and packaged with fellow Decepticon Space Case.
* &quot;Classics&quot; Commemorative Soundwave (2007)
:A Toys &quot;R&quot; Us exclusive is said to be near identical to the original toy. This, however, has one difference from that of the 1984 figure, being that the chest compartment (tape deck door) has been re-molded to hold two cassette Transformers as opposed to one. This version of Soundwave is actually a &#x27;reverse repaint&#x27; of the Japanese-exclusive Soundblaster, himself a retooling of the original Soundwave. Commemorative Soundwave includes both Ravage and Laserbeak, two cassettes seen prominently in the original series.
* &quot;Titanium&quot; 6-inch Soundwave with Laserbeak (2007)
:Two versions of Generation 1 Soundwave were released in the Transformers: Titanium toy line. One was a 3-inch non-transforming version in robot mode. The other is a transformable 6-inch version that transforms into a cassette deck. Both Soundwave&#x27;s feature die cast metal and plastic parts, and the 6-inch version also includes a transformable Laserbeak. It is also rumored that the larger version would be repainted and released as Soundblaster along with Ravage.
* &quot;Attacktix&quot; Soundwave (2007)
:Series 2 of the Transformers Attacktix figures included a Generation 1 Soundwave figure.
* &quot;Music Label&quot; Soundwave (2007)
:An MP3 player designed to look like the Generation 1 Soundwave figure. MiniSD cards fit inside his chest compartment, and it comes with the shoulder gun, blaster, and alternate hands for holding the gun, making fists, and his &quot;eject&quot; finger. Uses 1 AAA battery. Despite the claim on the box, it can use at least up to a 2 GB memory card and play songs over 128 kbit/s. In robot mode, he is the same size as Titanium Soundwave, though in &quot;Cassette&quot; mode he is longer and slightly taller. There are also headphones that are sold separately designed to look like Soundwave&#x27;s minions Rumble and Frenzy.
:Soundwave is available in three colors: Sonic White, Spark Blue (which closely resembles his original G1 incarnation) and Blaster Black (an homage to Soundblaster).
:This figure was voted the 43rd top toy released in the last 10 years by &quot;ToyFare&quot; Magazine.
* &quot;Transformers&quot; Encore Reissue Soundwave (2007)
:A release by Takara Tomy in Japan that is nearly identical to the original 1984 toy. Unlike the original 1984 release that was packaged with Buzzsaw, the Encore figure was packaged with Laserbeak.
* &quot;Mighty Muggs&quot; Soundwave (2008)
:A Mighty Muggs doll of Soundwave with gun.
* &quot;Universe&quot; 25th Anniversary Soundwave (2009)
:A San Diego Comic-Con exclusive reissue of the original G1 Soundwave figure that comes with Buzzsaw, Laserbeak, Ravage and Ratbat.
* &quot;Classics&quot; Deluxe Soundwave (unreleased)
:Although no new mold was released for &quot;Classics&quot; Soundwave (they instead reused the Takara Soundblaster mold), a design for a new Soundwave toy that turned into a SUV was considered. This design seems to have inspired &quot;Animated&quot; Soundwave.
* &quot;Masterpiece&quot; MP-13 Soundwave (2012)
:An all-new mold of Soundwave in Takara Tomy&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece&quot; line. Comes packaged with Condor/Laserbeak, collapsible weapons that transform into batteries, a clear Energon cube that can be attached to his chest, a detachable display grid, a forearm scanner attachment, a translucent pink cassette case and a new version of the Megatron gun originally offered in MP-01 Convoy/Optimus Prime. Aside from holding up to three newer Masterpiece cassette robots, Soundwave&#x27;s chest can also accommodate the original G1 cassettes. Laserbeak in bird mode can peg on Soundwave&#x27;s left shoulder or forearm.

==Transformers: Cybertron==

In &quot;&quot;, Soundwave&#x27;s origins are greatly altered. While in the original G1 continuity, he was a native of Cybertron like Megatron and Starscream, this incarnation of Soundwave is the second Transformer from the mysterious Planet X. This is also the first incarnation to have an actual vehicle mode. He transforms into a Planet X Jet (bearing a resemblance to a stealth bomber) and is partnered with a smaller robot called Laserbeak &quot;(Killer Condor in Japan)&quot;. In the English dub of this series, he has a synthesized voice, similar to his G1 counterpart. Unlike the Generation One Soundwave, he speaks like a modern disc jockey—using terms like &quot;&quot;He got served&quot; and &quot;Peace out, bots&quot;, and calling the battlefield, &quot;The Floor&quot;&quot;, giving him more of a personality than his normally emotionless G1 counterpart. This version of Soundwave is unique in comparison to any other incarnation, as while in most other continuities, outside of the Armada trilogy, Soundwave was Megatron&#x27;s most loyal soldier, this Soundwave has no true loyalty towards the Decepticon leader.

The package bio for Soundwave mentions that Planet X itself may be a total deception, and that it is actually a term the agents use to refer to their service to Unicron. Although he and Sideways are the survivors of a dead civilization, they actually serve Unicron throughout space and time as his heralds in taking over new worlds to replace his loss of previous forms.

Soundwave is armed with two cannons, and can hide himself behind holograms when working in conjunction with Laserbeak.

===Animated series===
Soundwave first makes his appearance in the episode &quot;Titan&quot;, offering to lead Megatron and his minions to the planet Gigantion, however, in a scene featuring Sideways and Starscream aboard the Atlantis, a purple cassette player with the Decepticon symbol is on board playing music to ease the tension between the two evil robots. It is not clear if this is Soundwave or not, but it is interesting that he appeared in &quot;Titan&quot; just a few episodes later. In his first encounter with the Autobots he fought Optimus Prime and Wing Saber in their Sonic Wing mode and was able to hold his own in combat until Megatron was defeated by Metroplex and the Decepticons retreated.

Shortly after they arrived on Gigantion and there Megatron was upgraded into Galvatron, Soundwave abandoned the Decepticons, and joined up with his counterpart, Sideways. During a battle with the Autobot Cybertron Defense Team, he revealed the history of his world, and how they desired the Cyber Planet Keys to get revenge on the inhabitants of Gigantion.

Later, he and Sideways attempted to intervene in the epic battle between Galvatron and Starscream in order to claim the Planet Keys and Omega Lock, only to be sent into another universe by the distortion caused by the two fighters&#x27; conflict.

However, Soundwave would appear later, when Starscream reached out to Galvatron across dimensions, seemingly trapped along with him and Sideways. However, Starscream seemed to have returned by the series&#x27; end, while Soundwave and Sideways were shown to have found a dimension where Planet X still existed.

Soundwave is the only major transformer in the series who never summons his Cyber Key. In his toy version, his Cyber Key opens his chest compartment to store Laserbeak or one of his two cannons. In his first appearance to the Autobots, Soundwave demonstrates the ability to do this without the aid of a Cyber Key.

G1 Soundwave makes a cameo appearance in the animated series as a blue boombox that Sideways used to hear music.

===Fun Publications===
The &quot;Cybertron&quot; incarnation of Soundwave was among the characters to appear in the comic strip published exclusively through the Transformers Collectors Club, arriving on the planet itself to observe Vector Prime, Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime after their defeat of Unicron&#x27;s heralds, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet, and capture of the Dead Matrix. Dispatching Laserbeak to recover the Dead Matrix from its place in storage, Soundwave threw the talisman into the black hole that had been created by the collapse of Unicron, allowing the Chaos Bringer&#x27;s Spark to escape and infiltrate the planet Yst, which he corrupted and transformed into his new body. Soundwave would link up with his master, and watch the unfolding carnage of a Mini-Con civil war. However, when Unicron chose that moment to attack, Soundwave was attacked by several Mini-Cons, including Scythe and Perceptor. Unable to hit the smaller Mini-Cons, Soundwave fled with Unicron when Primus awoke.

===Toys===
* &quot;Cybertron&quot; Voyager Soundwave (2005)
:The first actual homage to the original Soundwave in modern times, the &quot;Cybertron&quot; toy transforms not into a tape deck, but a sleek alien stealth fighter. Beyond this, however, the nods to the original character are many, from his head design, his multi-barreled shoulder cannon to his opening chest door, activated by his Cyber Key. Soundwave comes with a new incarnation of Laserbeak, who transforms into a battery bomb that can be stored within Soundwave&#x27;s chest compartment. This toy was recolored into &quot;Universe&quot; Blaster. This toy was based on an F-117 Nighthawk.
* &quot;Galaxy Force&quot; Voyager Soundblaster
:A black repaint of Soundwave, predictably named Soundblaster, was released exclusively in Japan through Takara&#x27;s &quot;Toy&#x27;s Dream Project&quot; series. However, this Soundblaster is a separate character from Soundwave.
* &quot;Cybertron&quot; Legends Soundwave (2006)
:A Micro class Soundwave was released in the third wave of the Legends of Cybertron toy line. It came without Laserbeak. In 2007, a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toys was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave, all identical to their original releases.

==Transformers Cinematic Universe==
===Creation and development===
Almost from the moment the live action &quot;Transformers&quot; movie was announced in 2007, producer Don Murphy and the production team made it clear they did not want to feature mass/size shifting in transformation (excluding the Allspark), due to concerns over realism. With this process, there was some discussion over whether or not to change Soundwave&#x27;s tape deck alternate mode due to its obsolescence, or to include the character in the film at all. It was announced by Hasbro at SDCC 2004 that movie Soundwave would be a helicopter. Early leaked movie scripts proposed that his alternate mode would be a helicopter, but animatics shown at the 2005 Comic Con were poorly received. This led to a rethink, with the eventual helicopter character rechristened as Vortex, then finally Blackout. 2006 script reviews named Soundwave as a spying boombox on Air Force One, able to transform into a small robot, but eventually, this character was amended to being Frenzy, with Don Murphy stating that Soundwave will be reserved for a future sequel, until they can &quot;do him right&quot;. When the film was released on DVD a special on-line content from Best Buy showed early animation footage of Blackout as a blue helicopter with a head that resembled Soundwave.

In a &quot;USA Today&quot; online fan poll, Soundwave was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, winning with 20% of the votes.

Soundwave appears in &quot;&quot;. Soundwave is a satellite in the film. Soundwave is not seen in his robot form in the film. Frank Welker reprised his voicing role, and used his Doctor Claw voice from &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, which, when run through a vocoder, gives Soundwave his unique voice from the original animated series. The lack of this vocoder in the 2009 film left the voice sounding more like Doctor Claw than the original Soundwave. He has his minion Ravage to do his bidding in the film.

Soundwave also appears in &quot;&quot;, this time transforming into a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and with Laserbeak to serve him. Soundwave is armed with sonic cannons.

His Hasbro Battle Bio states that he is 22 feet tall and that his main weapons are sonic cannons which can only be used in the atmosphere, as sound waves will not travel in the vacuum.

Soundwave also makes a brief appearance in the movie &quot;Bumblebee&quot;. His appearance closely matches his G1 counterpart and appears alongside Shockwave and Starscream (a non-speaking role for the latter). He is voiced by Jon Bailey, who also voices Shockwave in the film. Unlike previous films, Bailey&#x27;s voice is run through a vocoder to bring back Soundwave&#x27;s signature voice.

===Films===
In &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, Soundwave is only seen in his Cybertronian satellite mode, hovering above Earth in orbit. Like his original counterpart, he functions as a Decepticon espionage agent and communications officer. In the film, he receives a message from Wheelie on Mikaela Banes possessing a shard of the Allspark and orders him to retrieve it. Soundwave would later hack into a human satellite and discover the location of another Allspark shard, deploying his servant Ravage to retrieve it. Following the death of Optimus Prime, Soundwave would carry out Megatron&#x27;s orders to prepare the Decepticons for an invasion of Earth. Soundwave would later locate Sam Witwicky&#x27;s parents in Paris, France. Ravage was later killed by Bumblebee.

Frank Welker returned to reprise his role as Soundwave in this movie, and the film following after, but unlike his G1 counterpart, his voice was not vocoded, which the character was well known for.

In &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot;, Soundwave was retconned into having been on Earth since the 1970s. He discovered the Autobot spaceship, the &quot;Ark&quot;, on the Moon, and forcibly recruited various human servants from the U.S. and Russian space agencies to prevent further exploration of it following the initial Moon landings, while he ordered an army of Decepticons to steal most of the pillars onboard and hide under the moon&#x27;s surface. In the modern day, he appears at Megatron&#x27;s base in Africa, where he and Laserbeak report the Autobot&#x27;s recovery of Sentinel Prime and the remaining pillars from the crashed &quot;Ark&quot;. Megatron praises Soundwave&#x27;s initiative in the decades-long plan and orders Laserbeak to kill their human allies. The only human ally they don&#x27;t kill, Dylan Gould, has Soundwave disguise himself as a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG that belonged to Sam&#x27;s girlfriend, Carly, to get close to the Autobots. He reveals himself and captures Carly once the two humans learn of Gould&#x27;s alliance with the Decepticons, and threatens her to convince Sam to discover the Autobot&#x27;s plans. During the battle in Chicago, Soundwave and Barricade lead several Decepticons in capturing some of the Autobots. Gould convinces Soundwave not to take prisoners, and Soundwave orders the others to execute their &quot;trophies&quot;. Once Que is dead, Soundwave prepares to kill Bumblebee himself, but a Decepticon battle-cruiser hijacked by Wheelie and Brains drops fighters near Soundwave, distracting him and allowing the Autobots to fight back. Bumblebee attacks Soundwave who tries to shoot him, but is confused among the crushing ships and shoots the other Decepticons. Bumblebee then kills Soundwave by sticking his cannon into Soundwave&#x27;s chest and shooting upwards.

In &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, Soundwave is seen on Cybertron along with Shockwave and Starscream commanding the Decepticons in the war against the Autobots. He manages to capture Optimus Prime with the help of a small army and Ravage, but Prime escapes from them.

=== Animation film ===
Soundwave appears in &quot;Transformers One&quot; (2024), voiced again by Jon Bailey. He was the Cybertronian High Guard&#x27;s communications officer, alongside his leader Starscream before the arrival of D-16, who usurped his leadership before becoming Megatron.

===Other media===

====Comic books====
In issue #4 of &quot;Transformers: Defiance&quot;, it is revealed that the reason for Soundwave to have been believed to be dead is because he was on the Decepticons ship that &quot;The Fallen&quot; was commanding, and that all of its crew were missing by the time Megatron noticed the emergency signal emitting from the ship while he was chasing the Allspark.

Soundwave first appeared in issue #2 of &quot;&quot;, where he arrived at the crash site of the &quot;Nemesis&quot; on Mars. There, he found Dreadwing&#x27;s head, as well as the body of Frenzy, then contacted Starscream and told him to rally at his signal. Starscream was surprised to hear from Soundwave, as he had been believed dead for years. Soundwave deployed a number of his forces on Earth, leaving others on his ship.

In &quot;Tales of the Fallen&quot; #5, Soundwave, still in orbit after the events of the 2009 film, notices someone has reactivated Ravage.

Soundwave appears in &quot;Transformers: Nefarious&quot; #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes. In &quot;Nefarious&quot; #2, Soundwave sent Dirt Boss, Reverb, and Brakedown to Wendover, Utah, to find an &quot;Initiative&quot; facility. Soundwave then contacted Ravage in order to discover how he was resurrected. Then, he proceeded to assist Reverb, Dirt Boss, and Brakedown in a fight with the Autobots. After a battle with Optimus Prime, Soundwave convinces the Autobot leader to join forces temporarily, in order to find &quot;the Initiative&quot;.

====Novels====
In the &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot; coloring book, Soundwave is depicted hacking into a military satellite.

====Television====
In &quot;Cyber Missions #1&quot;, Soundwave successfully infiltrates the NEST command base (in his satellite mode), which is guarded by Bumblebee. Soundwave transforms and smashes the screen projecting Optimus Prime and engages the Autobot. Bumblebee fires a shot, but Soundwave sends it back to Bumblebee as a sonic boom. Bumblebee then fires several more rounds with Soundwave frantically trying to absorb all the bullets, but finally being blown backwards. In &quot;Cyber Missions #2&quot;, Bumblebee trapped Soundwave in a vacuum-sealed electromagnetic bubble, rendering his abilities useless.

====Video games====
Like in the movie, Soundwave coordinates the mission to the playable Decepticon. His voice is now in a similar Vocoder fashion to his G1 counterpart.

In Dark of the Moon, Soundwave is a playable character. He is ordered by Megatron to destroy a Sector 7 nest base that contains information about Sentinel Prime. Soundwave is among the Decepticons that greet Shockwave at the end of the game in South Africa. He shows Shockwave a 3D hologram of Chernobyl and the artifact he must recover. He transforms into a Modified white SUV similar to a Cadillac SRX.

In the Nintendo DS game &quot;&quot;, Grindor, Sideways, Soundwave and Starscream greet a new Decepticon protoform and send him on a mission. Soundwave directs the new protoform to survive on Earth.

In the downloadable content pack for the Xbox 360 and PS3, Soundwave is confirmed to be a playable character. He is probably based on the Deluxe toy.

In &quot;&quot; for the Wii and 3DS, Soundwave is a playable character, and (like with the PS3/360 version), he transforms into a heavily modified Cadillac SRX

In &quot;&quot;, Soundwave is a playable character taking the alternate form of a cybertronian truck. He is playable in levels 3, 4 and 5 of the Decepticon campaign and is a boss that players have to fight in the Autobot level 2. Like all the characters within the game, he is playable in escalation mode, and players have to have their Decepticon leader look like him in multiplayer mode. In the game his default weapon is a neutron assault rifle, although he does have an energon repair ray in level 5 of the Decepticon campaign.

Blind-Bags stamped with the letter &#x27;H&#x27; contain Soundwave figures.

==Transformers: Animated==
&quot;&quot; Soundwave has a completely different origin story from most other versions of Soundwave. Starting off as an Earth-based robot toy, he became sentient after exposure to a key containing the power of the Allspark, which is responsible for creating Cybertronian life. Whilst his robot mode still retains elements of his original tapedeck incarnation, more so in his toy form, his alt-mode is now a loudspeaker-equipped Scion xB. He also possesses two supporters: Laserbeak, who transforms into an electric guitar he uses for a sonic boom attack, and Ratbat, which becomes a keytar for use in sonic hypnosis. His voice, now provided by Jeff Bennett in the United States and Nobuo Tobita in Japan, retains the use of a vocoder to create Soundwave&#x27;s trademark robotic monotone voice.

===Animated series===
Soundwave was originally a simple robotic toy that Sari got for her birthday, built by Megatron as part of a plan to take advantage of Sari&#x27;s careless and repeated use of her Allspark key to continuously upgrade the toy until it serves as a suitable body for Megatron to host. However, the excessive usage of the key to enhance Soundwave caused an unexpected side-effect: Developing almost Cybertronian sophistication at an alarmingly increasing rate to the point of becoming self-aware, refusing to take orders from Sari (or any other human) anymore. It was by observing the common labor-robots in the city that he concluded that not only robots are superior to humans in every way, but that it&#x27;s illogical that robots are forced to succumb to their human masters, and it should be the other way around. By then, Megatron introduced himself to Soundwave through televisions in a nearby electronics store as his creator &quot;of sorts&quot; to impose onto him his plan to crush the Autobots. At first, Soundwave declared it illogical to fight robot-kind until Megatron insisted that they were traitors that upheld the human race&#x27;s slavery of all robot-kind, convincing Soundwave to ultimately side with the Decepticons with the intent to overthrow all humans and obliterate the robots that protect them. He used his technology-manipulating speakers to summon all nearby labor-robots to convert them into his new Transformer body while using his stereo-system to spark a robot-revolution against their &quot;human-oppressors.&quot; All automated forms of public transportation stopped, and the city&#x27;s labor robots jumped the Autobots when they appeared on the scene. After failing to convince Bulkhead into joining him and killing Sari in the name of all robot-kind, it appeared that Bulkhead destroyed Soundwave with a single blow of his powerful wrecking-ball arm, shattering his body into hundreds of pieces. However, unknown to the Autobot, his core survived, in the form of a small, almost-invisible media player.

Soundwave regenerated at Christmas time as ex-Sumdac Systems Vice President Porter C. Powell, who had acquired Soundwave&#x27;s original patents while he was in charge of the company, and was distributing multiple Soundwave toys during the Christmas season. Soundwave managed to reprogram some of the toys, using one of them to spike the Autobots&#x27; oil nog. With the Autobots now sedated and out of commission, Soundwave proceeded to take them to the basement where he attempted to brainwash them into taking on his ideology as Decepticons by placing them in a virtual program in human form. However, the plan was briefly halted by the attempted intervention of Sari as well as the Autobots learning the truth about where they are. Soundwave had a backup plan, using Laserbeak to force Sari into a retreat, then using Ratbat in keytar mode to complete the Autobots&#x27; reformatting. Soundwave succeeded in placing the Autobots under his control, and used the numerous toy replicas of himself to take control of the humans in Detroit. However, since Sari was techno-organic, she was immune to the mind-control waves. Soundwave was defeated when Sari recruited the help of Scrapper, Snarl and Wreck-Gar to fight the brainwashed Autobots, and was smashed apart along with Ratbat by Optimus using Laserbeak&#x27;s guitar mode as a makeshift axe. Though Soundwave&#x27;s core still remained intact, it was eventually turned off by Sari before being rescued by Laserbeak. It is unknown what became of Soundwave after that.

:A Deluxe sized figure that transforms into a Scion xB-like vehicle. Soundwave&#x27;s bio describes his alternate mode as an SUV, although the Scion xB is actually a station wagon that resembles a small minivan.

It can also be attached to the top of his vehicle mode or held like a guitar in robot mode. His upper torso has the look of an old cassette player door, set up as a nod to his G1 toy.

==Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)==
This Soundwave is an alternate good version of the Generation 1 character from the BotCon exclusive &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; comic, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. His appearance is based on the white music label Soundwave MP3 player, while Buzzsaw seems to be based on Steeljaw in appearance.

===Fun Publications===
Soundwave first appears as a member of Megatron&#x27;s forces in the &quot;Transformers: Timelines&quot; story &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; by Fun Publications. He helps in the attack on the Autobots&#x27; Ark launching platform, working with Buzzsaw.

Soundwave makes a cameo in the fiction &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dinobots&quot;, a text-based story. When the Autobots are gaining the advantage in an attack on the Arch-Ayr fuel dump he calls in the Mayhem Suppression Squad to help the Decepticons.

Soundwave appears in the story &quot;Do Over&quot;. He is among the crew of the &quot;Nemesis&quot;, which follows the Autobots&#x27; Ark to Earth. When the ship is damaged in battle with the Ark, he escapes in a stasis pod to Earth.

Soundwave is spotlighted in the story &quot;The Desert Heat!&quot;. In this story, having crashed to Earth in an escape pod, Heatwave recovers Soundwave and helps his fellow Decepticon get back online and assume an Earth-style alternate mode.

Soundwave appears in the story &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot;. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to Burpleson Air Force Base to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.

Soundwave is spotlighted in the story &quot;Blitzwing Bop&quot;. The Elite Guardsman Thunderwing intercepts a radio signal from Earth which mentions Soundwave. Finding Soundwave is wanted for a minor offense from long ago he heads to Earth. Thunderwing finds Soundwave involved in a battle with the Autobot Blaster for the possession of the malfunctioning Decepticon Blitzwing. Although not interested in the dispute, Soundwave convinces Thunderwing that he cannot leave Earth for trial on Cybertron until his commanding officer can be notified, and the only way to get Starscream online is to rescue Blitzwing. Thunderwing is still unwilling to take sides in the battle against Blaster, merely following the Decepticon, but Soundwave tricks Blaster into mentioning a crime he committed on Cybertron while Thunderwing is nearby. Thunderwing immediately goes into arrest mode and tries to capture Blaster, but Blaster escapes in a malfunctioning Stellar Spanner. With Starscream back online, Soundwave confesses to his minor crimes and Thunderwing passes a sentence of community service on him.

===Toys===
An official toy exists, as part of the SG Blaster Vs SG Soundwave box-set, and is a repaint of the G1 Soundblaster toy (itself, a retool of the G1 Soundwave toy). In addition, the white Music Label Soundwave figure matches his colors almost exactly, save for the Decepticon symbol on his chest, and has been officially repurposed as one of this character&#x27;s forms.

* &quot;Timelines&quot; Deluxe Shattered Glass Soundwave (2012)
:A BotCon 2012 exclusive white and blue redeco of the &quot;Universe/Classics 2.0&quot; Deluxe Ironhide/Ratchet figure with a new head sculpt. The van&#x27;s side panels are decorated with &quot;Cold Slither&quot; logos as a nod to the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; episode of the same name.

==Transformers Aligned Continuity==

Soundwave was a gladiator around the same time as Megatron. He has many pet Mini-Cons who work for him, particularly Laserbeak.

===&quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;===
Soundwave is one of the main antagonists in the 2011 animated series &quot;&quot;. Unlike his previous incarnations, Soundwave rarely speaks, instead recording archive audio and videos from other sources and repeating it when needed, displaying it on his face, which is composed entirely of an electronic screen. This was because Duane Capizzi, the producer of the show, wanted Soundwave to contrast with the talkative Starscream. Due to his silent persona, the show&#x27;s staff compared him to Boba Fett from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He is armed with two cables that extend from his chest, each having an electrical appendage on their end that has a variety of uses, and can create portals to transport objects. He is rarely seen in combat, spending most of his time supporting the Decepticons as a communications officer and technical specialist. However, he is shown to be a proficient fighter when circumstances need it.

Soundwave speaks only once in the episode &quot;Minus One&quot;, mocking the Autobots before going offline (&quot;Soundwave: superior, Autobots: inferior&quot;). Once again, his voice was modulated like his G1 counterpart, albeit less enhanced. Frank Welker reprises his role as Soundwave for the episode.

In the &quot;Darkness Rising&quot; 5 part mini-series, Soundwave detects the presence of Arcee, so Starscream sends a pair of Decepticons to attack her. Later, Soundwave detects a signal from deep space, which he is certain is Megatron, so the Space Bridge is opened, and Megatron returns. Later, Soundwave deploys Laserbeak at Starscream&#x27;s orders to capture Fowler in order to locate the Autobot base. He is later assigned to hijack an Earth bond radio telescope array to locate Cybertron, as part Megatron&#x27;s plan to use their Space Bridge to transport Dark Energon to Cybertron. However, the Autobots&#x27; young human allies figure out the Decepticons have hijacked the array and go to the array to shut it down. The young computer wiz Raf hacks into the array&#x27;s computer system, and Soundwave attacks them. He cuts the array&#x27;s main line locking the dishes in place. While preparing to leave, the Autobots human ally Miko takes a picture of Soundwave with her cell phone.

Soundwave responds to this by taking a picture of Jack, Miko, and Raf (possibly with the intention of passing it along with information of their connection with the Autobots onto his fellow Decepticons).

Soundwave is well aware of Starscream&#x27;s treachery against Megatron, and on several occasions saves Megatron from his treacherous lieutenant. In &quot;Masters &amp; Students&quot;, Soundwave sent Laserbeak to make sure that Starscream retrieved the incapacitated Megatron from the Space Bridge wreckage while he witnesses Optimus&#x27; battle with Skyquake. In &quot;Sick Mind&quot;, when Starscream and Knock Out conspire to euthanize the comatose Megatron, Soundwave at first appears to consider agreeing with the two, but points out the cord of Bumblebee&#x27;s cortical psychic patch the Autobot is hooked up to, and orders Megatron to be put back online so that he will not have fallen by an Autobot&#x27;s hand.

In &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, Megatron reveals that he is aware of Starscream&#x27;s ongoing treachery due to Soundwave having constant surveillance on the traitor and relaying his attempts of usurping him.

In &quot;One Shall Rise&quot; Pt. 3, Airachnid is placed in temporary command of the Decepticons when Megatron leaves to aid Optimus in defeating Unicron. In an attempt to secure her power for good, and to escape Unicron&#x27;s wrath, Airachnid suggests that the Decepticons leaves Megatron to continue their efforts on another world. Soundwave, out of respect for Megatron, vetoed her orders and displayed unexpected combat skills to secure the ship for when Megatron returned. It is implied that, although Megatron is made aware of Airachnid&#x27;s attempted grab for power, he does not punish her until Soundwave reminds him of her treachery in the season 2 episode &quot;Crossfire&quot;.

In &quot;Orion Pax&quot; Pt. 1, Megatron orders Soundwave to remove Arcee from the ship after she broke in to try to rescue Optimus Prime. Soundwave manages to open a ground bridge to bridge her off, right before Orion saw her.

In &quot;Triage&quot;, Soundwave hunts for an ancient Cybertronian relic. Having lost his minion Laserbeak, he continues the search on his own, fighting Wheeljack to claim the relic, the Resonance Blaster, and defeat Wheeljack before he reclaims Laserbeak. He returns to the Nemesis with Megatron&#x27;s prize, and is highly praised for it by Megatron, putting Knock Out and Dreadwing, who lost their relics to Arcee, Bumblebee and Starscream, to shame.

In &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;, Soundwave captured Smokescreen and brought him on board the &quot;Nemesis&quot; after the Decepticons learned that Smokescreen was a clue to finding the final Omega Key.

In &quot;Regeneration&quot; and &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;, Soundwave, along with Starscream and Knock Out, captured the children and held them for ransom unless the Autobots gave the Omega Keys to the Decepticons. However, when Optimus Prime destroyed the Omega Lock (and the Keys with them), Soundwave retreated back to the &quot;Nemesis&quot; with the other Decepticons.

In &quot;Darkmount, NV&quot;, when Jack and Arcee were spotted in Jasper following the destruction of the Autobot base, Soundwave sent Laserbeak, along with two Vehicons, to terminate them. However, after Laserbeak was destroyed, Soundwave was unable to retrieve any surveillance footage from his remains.

In &quot;Scattered&quot; and &quot;Prey&quot;, Soundwave was present when Shockwave presented Predaking to Megatron.

In &quot;Rebellion&quot;, when Starscream sent out members of his armada to investigate a number of Autobot signals, Soundwave pointed out to him that their army was thinly spread and suggested that the Autobots were using the &quot;Harbinger&quot; as a base of operations. He later retreated with the other Decepticons as Darkmount was destroyed by Optimus Prime, aided by Agent Fowler and several Air Force pilots.

In &quot;Thirst&quot;, he oversees the destruction of the mutant Terrorcons and is confronted by a newly freed Airachnid, who regained control of her Insecticons. When she charges him, he opens a space bridge to one of Cybertron&#x27;s moons stranding her and her minions.

In &quot;Minus One&quot;, Soundwave is taken captive by the Autobots and questioned for information regarding Megatron&#x27;s motives. However, Soundwave erases all the data of Megatron&#x27;s plans before Optimus gives Ratchet approval to crack him open. The normally mute Decepticon then taunts the Autobots in his own voice before deactivating. Later, Laserbeak attacks the Autobot base and hooks up with Soundwave, reactivating him and giving him a new copy of Megatron&#x27;s plans. He then proceeds to incapacitate Bulkhead and Smokescreen before kidnapping Ratchet and bringing him to the Nemesis.

In &quot;Deadlock&quot;, Soundwave fights Jack and Miko (who is in the Apex armor) on the bridge of the Nemesis. With help from Raf, Jack and Miko trap Soundwave in the Shadowzone.

===&quot;Transformers: Robots in Disguise&quot;===
Soundwave returns from the Shadowzone in the tenth episode of the second season of the sequel series &quot;&quot;. He escapes, trapping Bumblebee in the Shadowzone. Then, he quickly immobilizes most of the Autobots before getting tricked by Fixit and the humans into letting Bumblebee back in. The Autobots corner Soundwave and throw him back into the Shadowzone.
However, he returns in the final season, as a major antagonist with a new body. In &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;, he tries to return Megatron from his exile, but his plan fails when he is defeated by Bumblebee and his team along with Optimus Prime who was upgraded with Hi-Test.

Frank Welker reprises his role once again, with his voice more closely resembling his G1 counterpart than in &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;.

===Books===
Soundwave appears in the novel &quot;&quot;. He was one of Megatrons&#x27; opponents and nearly defeated him, however this brought respect between the two instead. Soundwave commanded the Mini-Cons Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy, and Laserbeak, and joined Megatron as one of the Decepticons.

Soundwave appears in the short story &quot;Bumblebee at Tyger Pax&quot; by Alex Irvine.

Soundwave appears in the novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Video games===

A playable character in the last three chapters of the Decepticon campaign. While Shockwave is established as Megatron&#x27;s second-in-command, Soundwave is shown acting as Megatron&#x27;s right hand during the campaign in Shockwave&#x27;s absence.

Soundwave assists Megatron and Breakdown into infiltrating Iacon, defeating Zeta Prime, and hunting down Omega Supreme. He is also a boss in the Autobot campaign, being the warden of Kaon Prison in the Decepticons&#x27; capital city and using his tape cassettes Frenzy, Rumble and Laserbeak to attack. The Autobots manage to defeat him, but not before he delivers a fatal blow to Zeta Prime, absorbing what remained of his life force energy in order to regenerate his own strength, and then managing to escape before Optimus can finish him.

Aside from transforming into a Cybertronian truck, Soundwave can also turn into a boombox, as shown right before his boss battle, in the game&#x27;s ending credits and a GameStop promotional commercial for the game featuring Shockwave. In this mode, he plays the Stan Bush songs &quot;The Touch&quot; and &quot;Till All Are One&quot;.

In this sequel to &quot;Transformers: War for Cybertron&quot;, Soundwave is playable in two levels. The first time is in Chapter 9 in which he rebuilds Megatron after he was destroyed by Metroplex. The other level is the final one, in which Soundwave boards the &quot;Ark&quot; and helps destroy the Ark&#x27;s defenses. Rumble and Laserbeak assist Soundwave in these tasks. He pops up throughout the rest of the game as an NPC.

==Transformers: Cyberverse==
Soundwave appears in &quot;&quot;, appearing sporadically in season one and becoming a primary villain starting in season two, though he enters a much more heroic role in seasons three and four. More brutish and petty than previously incarnations, he is often shown playing fitting music for whatever situation is at hand on his speakers, annoying both Autobots and Decepticons alike.

Soundwave is first seen in the animated series in season one during a memory of Bumblebee&#x27;s at Maccadam&#x27;s Old Oil House, where he impresses some of the other patrons with his dancing skills. During season two, he butts heads with fellow Decepticon Shockwave, such as taking the opportunity to mock Shockwave when he gets chastised for &quot;making excuses&quot; by Megatron. During the first half of season three, Soundwave is one of the few Cybertronians freed from the Quintessons&#x27; time loop, where he learns to work alongside the Autobot Hot Rod to mount a campaign of resistance against them, and eventually becomes Hot Rod&#x27;s friend. However, as a result of being forcibly pulled out of the time loop, Soundwave occasionally freezes up. The two eventually learn about the Quintesson Scientist and go to confront him. The Scientist reveals that he keeps Soundwaves from universes that the Quintessons have judged &quot;guilty&quot; and destroyed as &quot;souvenirs&quot;, much to Soundwave&#x27;s disgust. After he freezes up again, the Scientist fixes him, and Soundwave &quot;thanks&quot; the Scientist by attacking him before releasing Laserbeak to help the other Cybertronians free all the Autobots and Decepticons from the loop. Soundwave and Hot Rod attempt to rally the bickering Autobots and Decepticons, though when this doesn&#x27;t work Soundwave releases a sonic blast to pacify everyone, before ordering them to train against the Quintesson forces. Soundwave plays a major role during the second half of season four, helping his fellow Cybertronians fight Tarn&#x27;s brainwashed Perfect Decepticon Supersoldiers. During the ensuing chaos, he manages to seize the Cortex Helm from Tarn and uses it to free the Perfect Decepticon Supersoldiers, ultimately sacrificing himself to annihilate both Tarn and the helm. Hot Rod holds a memorial for his fallen friend after the battle, which both Autobots and Decepticons attend as Cybertron finally enters a new age of peace.

<text>Dromoland Castle () is a castle, located near Newmarket-on-Fergus in County Clare, Ireland. It is operated as a five-star luxury hotel with a golf course, with its restaurant, the &quot;Earl of Thomond&quot;, being awarded a Michelin star in 1995, under head chef Jean Baptiste Molinari.

== Castle History ==
Dromoland Castle was the ancestral home of the O&#x27;Briens, Barons of Inchiquin, who are one of the few native Gaelic families of royal blood, and direct descendants of Brian Boroimhe (Boru), High King of Ireland in the eleventh century. For reasons of health and financial concerns, in the early 1960s Donough O&#x27;Brien (of the O&#x27;Brien dynasty), the sixteenth Baron of Inchiquin, decided to sell Dromoland castle, along with a parcel of 400 acres of land plus shooting and fishing rights to an American businessman, Bernard McDonough. McDonough, who was from West Virginia, had grandparents who had lived not far from Newmarket-on-Fergus, the village closest to the estate. After purchasing the estate in 1962, McDonough converted the castle into a luxury hotel in 1963.

Dromoland Castle Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels Worldwide.

== Famous guests ==

United States President George W. Bush spent the night of Friday, 26 June 2004, at Dromoland Castle to attend the EU-US Summit held at the facility. President Bush was guarded by approximately 7,000 police, military and private security forces during his 16-hour visit.

Over the years, notable people who have stayed at Dromoland Castle include John Lennon and George Harrison, Muhammad Ali, Bono, John Travolta, Juan Carlos I of Spain, Johnny Cash, and Nelson Mandela.

<doc id="988400" wikidata="Q2533198" url="?curid=988400" title="King John's Castle (Limerick)">
<text>King John&#x27;s Castle () also known as Limerick Castle is a 13th-century castle located on King&#x27;s Island in Limerick, Ireland, next to the River Shannon. Although the site dates back to 922 when the Vikings lived on the Island, the castle itself was built on the orders of King John of England in 1200. Some of the external walls, towers and fortifications remain, and the site is open for visitors. The remains of a Viking settlement were uncovered during archaeological excavations at the site in 1900.

The castle experienced five sieges during the 17th century. The walls were severely damaged during the 1642 siege when the castle was occupied by Protestants fleeing the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and was besieged by an Irish Confederate force under Garret Barry. 

Between 2011 and 2013, the castle underwent a €5.7 million redevelopment to improve the visitor facilities of the castle. Among the improvements were a modern visitor centre, interactive exhibitions with computer generated animations, and a cafe.

==Viking settlement==

The Viking sea-king, Tomrair mac Ailchi, built the first permanent Viking stronghold on Inis Sibhtonn (King&#x27;s Island) in 922. He used the base to raid the length of the River Shannon from Lough Derg to Lough Ree, pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. In 937 the Limerick Vikings clashed with those of Dublin on Lough Ree and were defeated. In 943 they were defeated again when the chief of the local Dalcassian clan joined with Ceallachán, king of Munster and the Limerick Vikings were forced to pay tribute to the clans. The power of the Vikings never recovered, and they were reduced to the level of a minor clan, however often playing pivotal parts in the endless power struggles of the next few centuries.

Domnall Mór Ua Briain burned the settlement to the ground in 1174 in a bid to keep it from the hands of the Anglo-Normans. After he died in 1194, the Anglo-Normans captured the area in 1195 under John, Lord of Ireland. In 1197, Limerick was given its first charter and its first mayor, Adam Sarvant, by Richard I of England. 

==Early history==
A castle, built on the orders of King John and bearing his name, was completed around 1210. The castle was built on the boundary of the River Shannon in order to protect the city from the Gaelic kingdoms to the west and from any rebellion by Norman lords to the east and south. Under the general peace imposed by the Norman rule, Limerick prospered as both a port and a trading centre, partly due to the castle acting as a watchdog on any cargo passing through the port of Limerick. By this time the city was divided into an area known as &quot;English Town&quot; on King&#x27;s Island, while another settlement, named &quot;Irish Town&quot;, had grown on the south bank of the river. The town of Limerick became so wealthy during this era that King John set up a mint in the North West corner of the castle, with pennies and half pennies from this time available to see in Limerick museum today. A 1574 document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth:

Luke Gernon, an English-born judge and resident of Limerick, wrote an equally flattering account of the city in 1620:
==Siege of Limerick==
The walls of the castle were severely damaged in the 1642 Siege of Limerick, the first of five sieges of the city in the 17th century. In 1642, the castle was occupied by Protestants fleeing the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and was besieged by an Irish Confederate force under Garret Barry. Barry had no siege artillery so he undermined the walls of King John&#x27;s Castle by digging away their foundations. Those inside surrendered just before Barry collapsed the walls. However, such was the damage done to the wall&#x27;s foundations that a section of them had to be pulled down afterward.

==2014 Redevelopment==
Between 2011 and 2014, the castle underwent a massive redevelopment, with €5.7 million spent to improve the visitor facilities of the castle. Among the improvements were a brand new visitor centre, interactive exhibitions with computer generated animations, and a cafe with views onto the courtyard and the river.

<text>Edward Grant (April 6, 1926 – June 21, 2020) was an American historian of medieval science. He was named a distinguished professor in 1983. Other honors include the 1992 George Sarton Medal, for &quot;a lifetime scholarly achievement&quot; as an historian of science.

==Biography==
Edward Grant was born in 1926. He initially attended trade school and joined the US Navy, serving as a radarman on the USS San Jacinto in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. After this military service, he attended City College in New York where he graduated in 1951. He continued to the University of Wisconsin where he received a master&#x27;s degree and a PhD in the history of science and medieval history in 1957. During this time, Grant spent a year at the University of Utrecht as a Fulbright Scholar from 1955-1956.

Grant began his teaching career while a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin. He was an assistant to a well-known scholar in the field, Marshall Clagett, whom he would continue to respect and correspond with throughout his career. Grant taught at the University of Maine and in the history of science program at Harvard University.

In 1959, Grant came to Indiana University as an assistant professor of history. His teaching career spanned over thirty years at IU. He was instrumental in starting the department later to be known as history and philosophy of science. Grant was named distinguished professor of both that department and the history department. A distinguished medievalist, Grant wrote prolifically throughout his professorship at IU. Professor Grant was twice chair of his department (1973–1979; 1987–1990) where he taught courses on medieval science, natural philosophy and science and religion. Grant was given the title Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Department of History and Philosophy of Science, Indiana University.

Grant was also a prominent member of several organizations, such as the Medieval Academy of America, the International Academy of the History of Science, and the History of Science Society. He served as vice-president of the History of Science Society from 1983-1984 and as president from 1985–86. Grant was also a frequent lecturer for organizations, such as the Phi Beta Kappa Associates Panel of Distinguished Speakers from 1990-1998.

Grant received many honors and awards, including the George Sarton Medal in 1992, the most prestigious award given by the History of Science Society that &quot;recognizes those whose entire careers have been devoted to the field and whose scholarship is exceptional.&quot;

==Work==
Grant&#x27;s edited volume &quot;A Source Book of Medieval Science&quot; (1974) was praised as an &quot;admirable anthology&quot; and a &quot;milestone&quot; for the field of study of medieval science by historian of medieval technology Lynn White Jr.

In his book &quot;The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts&quot; (1996), Grant discussed the developments and discoveries that culminated in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. He emphasized how the roots of modern science were planted in the ancient and medieval worlds long before the modern period, and that the Christian Latin civilization of Western Europe began the last stage of its intellectual development. One basic factor was how Christianity developed in the West with the establishment of the medieval universities around 1200.

In &quot;God and Reason in the Middle Ages&quot; (2001) he argued that the Middle Ages had acquired an undeserved reputation as an age of superstition, barbarism, and unreason.

<text>A team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport requires the participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. In team sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar bob in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork, strategy, and coordination among team members while competing against opposing teams to achieve a common goal. Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a sport.

==Distinctions==
The meaning of a &quot;team sport&quot; has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than &quot;traditional&quot; team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Overall, the division into team sports and individual sports is not always unproblematic since there are different combinations in the individual sports.

===Team sports and individual-to-team events===

====Pure team sports====
This includes sports that can only be practiced as a team sport. The number of team members is fixed for the team. In order to compete successfully in championships and tournaments, teams need a roster that is significantly larger than the number of players starting the game. Players may be substituted from a squad in competition matches to replace exhausted or injured players or to make tactical changes.
Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.

Teams of two people are common in certain sports, such as dancesport or beach volleyball. No substitute players are used here. The two partners are absolutely dependent on each other. The absence of a person here means a loss of competitiveness.

====Formations====
There are sports that are commonly played by individuals, or singles, but may also be played in a cooperative partner formation referred to as doubles. This includes sports such as badminton, table tennis, and tennis. In these formations, common tactics, teamwork, and agreements are crucial for success. There are also different rowing formations, such as one, two, four, and eight, or sailing with their different boat classes. The most important thing here is smooth movements and common tactics. This also applies approximately to the team time trial in cycling, which is the case with cycling tours and one-day races, which are different tasks for the team members of a cycling team.

====Relays====
In some sports, relay races are held, which can be distinguished from pure team evaluations by a common racing tactic and the observance of change regulations. Relay races are common in running, swimming, cross-country skiing, biathlon, or short-track speed skating and are also an integral part of the Olympic Games program with high popularity.
====Team ratings====
There are team ratings in many sports, and the results of individual athletes or formations are added up.
In cycling, team members, whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one member of the team, usually a specialist, to the highest possible finishing position. 
In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams, but also against each other for points towards championship standings, for example, in motorsport, particularly Formula One. Team orders can occur in such teams and although previously accepted were banned in Formula One between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the season.

===Overview comparison===
In summary, team sports are characterized by the impossibility or impracticality of executing the sport as a single-player endeavor, and the entire game or match relies on team dynamics. In contrast, sports with team ratings and formations involve both individual and team aspects, where individual performances contribute to a team&#x27;s overall success but may not be entirely reliant on team dynamics. Relay races combine individual efforts within a team context, where smooth transitions are essential.

==History==
Areas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians depicted athletic scenes in the tombs of kings and their nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, and those events that occurred were probably the preserve of kings and upper classes. Minoans culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with bull-leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The Mycenaeans adopted Minoan games and also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies. Homer&#x27;s heroes participate in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the &quot;Iliad&quot; there are chariot races, boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, archery, and spear throwing. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; adds to these a long jump and discus throw.

It was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE. These ancient Olympic Games consisted of running, long jump, boxing, wrestling, Pankration (combat sport), discus throw, and javelin throw. In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia, Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds. Prehistoric cave-paintings in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling. In Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Libya, a Neolithic rock painting in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 6000 BC.

Team sports have a rich and ancient history dating back thousands of years. These activities served as important facets of society, not only for physical fitness but also for social, cultural, and even political purposes. In ancient civilizations, team sports were prevalent and often intertwined with religious and cultural practices. In Mesoamerica, the Aztec ball game, ollamaliztli, was not just a sport but also a ritual with symbolic significance.

The Greeks, who laid the foundations for many contemporary sports, held various team sports as central to their culture. The Olympic Games, first recorded in 776 BCE, featured events like chariot racing and team foot races, fostering unity and friendly competition among city-states. The Spartans, known for their military prowess, engaged in team sports like the episkyros, a type of football.

Rome adopted and adapted many Greek sports, introducing harpastum, a ball game similar to soccer, and ludi circenses, which included team chariot racing. These sports provided a sense of entertainment and unity, while also serving as a means of social control.

In ancient China, cuju was a popular team sport akin to modern soccer, played as early as the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). The sport was not only a form of entertainment but also a means of fostering camaraderie among communities.

Throughout history, team sports have reflected the values and priorities of their respective cultures. Whether it was the competitive spirit of the Greeks, the discipline of the Romans, or the communal bonding in China, ancient team sports played an integral role in the social fabric of civilizations. They transcended mere physical activity, serving as a testament to the enduring significance of sports in human history. Today, these ancient traditions continue to influence modern team sports, reminding us of the timeless appeal and cultural importance of collective athletic endeavors.

Notes


Winter Olympics (2)
Ice hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics, with particularity that the men&#x27;s tournament in Ice hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics and was transferred permanently to the Winter Olympic Games program in 1924, in France. Before the monobob event has been introduced as an additional women&#x27;s class by the IBSF for the 2020–21 world cup season and the 2022 Olympic games, bobsleigh was considered as a pure team sport, that can only be practiced as a team with at least two drivers. At the present time the men&#x27;s events consist of the two-man and four-man class and the women&#x27;s events are restricted only to the two-woman and women&#x27;s monobob class.

<text>codice_1 is a program found on Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. It directly maps to a kernel call of the same name. codice_2 is used to invoke a utility or shell script with a particular CPU priority, thus giving the process more or less CPU time than other processes. A niceness of -20 is the lowest niceness, or highest priority. The default niceness for processes is inherited from its parent process and is usually 0.

Systems have diverged on what priority is the lowest. Linux systems document a niceness of 19 as the lowest priority, BSD systems document 20 as the lowest priority. In both cases, the &quot;lowest&quot; priority is documented as running only when nothing else wants to.

==Etymology==
&quot;Niceness value&quot; is a number attached to processes in *nix systems, that is used along with other data (such as the amount of I/O done by each process) by the kernel process scheduler to calculate a process&#x27; &#x27;true priority&#x27;which is used to decide how much CPU time is allocated to it.

The program&#x27;s name, nice, is an allusion to its task of modifying a process&#x27; niceness value.

The term &quot;niceness&quot; itself originates from the idea that a process with a higher niceness value is &quot;nicer&quot; to other processes in the system and to users by virtue of demanding less CPU powerfreeing up processing time and power for the more demanding programs, who would in this case be less &quot;nice&quot; to the system from a CPU usage perspective.

==Use and effect==
codice_2 becomes useful when several processes are demanding more resources than the CPU can provide. In this state, a higher-priority process will get a larger chunk of the CPU time than a lower-priority process. Only the superuser (root) may set the niceness to a lower value (i.e. a higher priority). On Linux it is possible to change codice_4 to allow other users or groups to set low nice values.

If a user wanted to compress a large file without slowing down other processes, they might run the following:

$ nice -n 19 tar cvzf archive.tgz largefile
The exact mathematical effect of setting a particular niceness value for a process depends on the details of how the scheduler is designed on that implementation of Unix. A particular operating system&#x27;s scheduler will also have various heuristics built into it (e.g. to favor processes that are mostly I/O-bound over processes that are CPU-bound). As a simple example, when two otherwise identical CPU-bound processes are running simultaneously on a single-CPU Linux system, each one&#x27;s share of the CPU time will be proportional to 20 − &quot;p&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; is the process&#x27; priority. Thus a process, run with codice_5, will receive 25% of the CPU time allocated to a normal-priority process: (20 − 15)/(20 − 0) = 0.25. On the BSD 4.x scheduler, on the other hand, the ratio in the same example is about ten to one.

==Similar commands==
The related codice_6 program can be used to change the priority of a process that is already running.

Linux also has an codice_7 program, which affects scheduling of I/O rather than CPU time.

<doc id="988411" wikidata="Q2419871" url="?curid=988411" title="Birr Castle">
<text>Birr Castle (Irish: ) is a large castle in the town of Birr in County Offaly, Ireland. It is the home of the 7th Earl of Rosse and his family, and as the castle is generally not open to the public, though the grounds and gardens of the demesne are publicly accessible, and include a science museum and a café, a reflecting telescope which was the largest in the world for decades and a modern radio telescope.

==History==

There has been a castle on the site since 1170, and from the 14th to the 17th centuries the O&#x27;Carroll family ruled from here over an area known as &quot;Ely O&#x27;Carroll&quot;.

After the death of Sir Charles O&#x27;Carroll, Sir Lawrence Parsons (died 1628) was granted Birr Castle and of land in 1620. Parsons engaged English masons in the construction of a new castle. This construction took place, not on the site of the O&#x27;Carrolls&#x27; Black Tower (since disappeared), but at its gatehouse. &quot;Flankers&quot; were added to the gatehouse diagonally at either side, giving the castle the plan it retains today.

After the death of Sir Laurence Parsons and of his elder son Richard, the castle passed to his younger son William. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, William was besieged at Parsonstown (as Birr was then) by Catholic forces for fifteen months. After the civil war, William&#x27;s son Laurence (baronet from 1677) refurbished the castle.

A later descendant—Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse—also engaged in some re-building, and heightened and &quot;Gothicised&quot; the castle in the early 19th century. In turn, his son, the 3rd Earl of Rosse, was responsible for the construction of the great telescope at Birr. When completed in 1845, it was the largest telescope on Earth, and capable of capturing more light and seeing further into space than any telescope had done before. Birr, therefore, became a focus for astronomical observations, and visitors came to visit the observatory from all over the world—including Charles Babbage and H.I.H. Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial.

When the 3rd Earl died, his sons continued the scientific tradition, and Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse is noted for measuring the heat of the moon. After his death in 1908, however, the telescope fell into disrepair; the mirror was taken to the Science Museum in London, and, circa 1914, the telescope&#x27;s metal supporting structure was melted down to be used in the First World War. In 1925, the wooden structures around the walls were demolished for safety reasons. 

Following several intermediate restoration attempts, the telescope was restored more completely in the late 1990s.

==The Demesne==
===Location===
The demesne runs south and south-east of Birr town centre. The main public entrance is through a courtyard; there is no direct public access to the castle, which faces into the demesne, with an internal gate on a bridge over a dry moat separating the castle&#x27;s inner surrounds from the broader parkland. The entrance courtyard contains the Science Centre, café, shop and garden entrance, while the family have an ornamental private road gateway, with a large adjoining gate lodge, occupied by a staff member, just to the north.

Birr&#x27;s main river, the River Camcor, enters the demesne near the castle, and continues through a pond to flow into the Little Brosna River, which in turn marks the border between Counties Offaly and Tipperary, and flows on to the Shannon. The demesne is open to the public for a fee, with an annual subscription available for &quot;Friends of Birr Castle Demesne&quot;.

===Ireland&#x27;s Historic Science Centre===
The castle grounds are also home to Ireland&#x27;s Historic Science Centre, a museum of Ireland&#x27;s historic scientists and their contributions to astronomy and botany. The museum lies within a courtyard off William Street. Its displays touch on astronomy, engineering, photography, botany and other topics. Laurence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse and his mother, Mary Parsons, Countess of Rosse, were eminent photographers, and her darkroom, which is also on show within the museum, is believed to be the oldest surviving example in the world.

===Café and shop===
The Castle Courtyard Café and a small shop are in the same courtyard as the Science Centre.

===Parklands and gardens===
The grounds of the castle contain the oldest wrought-iron bridge in Ireland, dating from 1820. There was also an early hydroelectric station by the bridge and castle.

The walled gardens in the grounds feature Box Hedges that are over 300 years old. They are also, according to &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;, the tallest hedge in the world.

The Irish entry to the 2014 European Tree of the Year contest was the Birr Castle Grey Poplar (&quot;Populus × canescens&quot;). In February 2014, while voting was still open, it was blown down in a storm.

===Membership and sponsorship===
The demesne&#x27;s charitable foundation offers quarterly, half-yearly and annual memberships, including unlimited visiting.

The grounds also contain a plantation of sequoia redwoods from California, Giants&#x27; Grove, organised by the estate and Crann, which are available for sponsorship, and the trees from a past sponsorship scheme operated with the Tree Council of Ireland.

==Astronomy==

===The &quot;Great Telescope&quot; – The Leviathan===

A major feature on the grounds of the castle is the &quot;Great Telescope&quot; or Leviathan of Parsonstown or &quot;The Rosse Telescope&quot; of the third Earl of Rosse, an astronomical telescope with a 183-cm (72 in) reflector. It was completed in 1845 and was used for several decades before the last observations were made in the first years of the 20th century. Its record size was not surpassed until the completion of the 100-inch (2.5-meter) Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1917. It was dismantled in 1914, but the structure was restored and the telescope reconstructed in the 1990s and is accessible to the public, with occasional demonstrations of its movement, and talks.

===Modern radio astronomy===

Trinity College Dublin leases land on the grounds of Birr Castle Demesne on which they operate the Rosse Observatory, which includes the Irish station of the LOFAR network, known as I-LOFAR, as well as some other smaller radio telescopes. I-LOFAR is operated on behalf of a consortium of Irish educational institutions. These operations have brought astronomical research activity back to Birr after a century-long gap since the decommissioning of the Leviathan.

The astronomical projects are situated near the Little Brosna River and the County Tipperary border. Astrophysicist Peter T. Gallagher, then of Trinity College Dublin, met Lord Rosse in 2010 while visiting the demesne in search of suitable quiet sites for radio-telescopy projects, and they agreed to repurpose an old sheep yard. The agreement led to the establishment of the Rosse Solar-Terrestrial Observatory, a Trinity College Dublin project, which was formally opened and blessed on 28 June 2014 (though already fully functional), with antennae picking up solar activity, even in cloudy weather. The sheep pen building was converted into a control room, and a magnetometer, jointly operated between TCD and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, was also installed. Already by 2012, solar bursts were being documented, and a major solar burst was detected by the Birr system in 2014 and reported in &quot;Nature Physics&quot;.

In the meantime, the project team started work on establishing the I-LOFAR radio-telescope station (IE613), a node in a Europe-spanning network, which was largely built in 2016, and was switched on at Birr in 2017. It was constructed in fields in the Mount Palmer area, between the Rivers Camcor and Little Brosna. As an international LOFAR station it has twice the number of antennas of a Dutch remote station, and four times the number of antennas of a core Dutch station. It consists of 192 antennas (96 antennas, each with two polarisations) for each antenna type for a total of 384 antennas. I-LOFAR is the westernmost station in the LOFAR network. The I-LOFAR telescope, in 2018, observed for the first time a billion-year-old red-dwarf, flare star called CN Leo, almost 75 trillion kilometres away. There is a viewing point provided for visitors to the demesne to overlook the telescope structure.

<doc id="988413" wikidata="Q2256923" url="?curid=988413" title="V and W-class destroyer">
<text>The V and W class was an amalgam of six similar classes of destroyer built for the Royal Navy under the 9th, 10th, 13th and 14th of fourteen War Emergency Programmes during the First World War and generally treated as one class. For their time they were among the most powerful and advanced ships of their type in the world, and set the trend for future British designs.

They arrived in time to see service in the First World War. During the interwar period these ships formed the backbone of the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyer flotillas until gradually replaced by new construction; by the mid-1930s most had been displaced to the reserve fleet. Most ships survived to make an extensive contribution to the Second World War effort, in the vital role of convoy escort, freeing up more modern ships for fleet action.

==History==

The V and W class were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design in the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Their lineage can be traced to the River or E class of 1902 that had introduced the classic raised forecastle into the Royal Navy. The of 1905 introduced oil-firing and the resultant economies in size, consumption and crew. The of 1915 had introduced a raised shelter deck forwards, allowing two guns to be carried in the classic superfiring (i.e. one gun fires over the top of the one below and in front of it) &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; positions. The , also of 1915, introduced a three-boiler, two-funnel layout allowing for a more compact hull and giving increased deckspace and the introduced geared turbines giving on two shafts.

==Design==
The new design, originally known as the Admiralty V-class leader, incorporated all these improvements, and also a more sensible layout of the main armament, the amidships gun between the funnels being removed to the aft shelter deck, superfiring over the gun on the quarterdeck. This introduced the ubiquitous &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; layout for the main armament. New developments, such as director firing for the main armament, triple torpedo tubes and a heavier armament were introduced either from the outset, or as they became available. Ships with triple tubes became the Admiralty W class and those with their armament upgraded to the BL 4.7 in gun became Admiralty Modified W-class ships.

==Admiralty V-class leaders==

The Admiralty V-class leaders were the initial five V-class ships ordered in April 1916 and were designed and built as flotilla leaders. These ships were necessary as the 36 knot speed of the new S class meant that existing flotilla leaders would no longer be able to keep pace with their charges. To speed construction time, these new vessels were based on the three-boiler, two-funnel machinery of the R class and as they were inevitably larger, a slight decrease in speed was accepted. The fore funnel was tall and narrow and the after one was shorter and wider.

They differed from the later Admiralty and the Thornycroft V classes in that they had a larger bridge structure, taller foremast, mainmast mounted further aft to accommodate an enlarged spread of wireless aerials, extra boats abreast the after funnel and the searchlight platform between the torpedo tubes was enlarged to accommodate an extra compass. &quot;Vampire&quot; trialled triple mounts for her torpedoes and as a result had a total of six tubes.

===Ships===
* &quot;Valentine&quot; – built by Cammell Laird &amp; Company, Birkenhead, laid down 8 August 1916, launched 24 March 1917, completed 27 June 1917, damaged by German aircraft, beached and abandoned off Terneuzen 15 May 1940, salvaged 1953 and broken up.

* – built by Denny, laid down 25 May 1916, launched 5 August 1917, completed 21 August 1917, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947.
* &quot;Vampire&quot; – built by J. Samuel White &amp; Company, Cowes, laid down 10 October 1916, launched 21 May 1917, completed 22 September 1917, transferred to Royal Australian Navy in October 1933, bombed and sunk by Japanese aircraft in the Bay of Bengal 9 April 1942.

==Admiralty V class==

The 23 vessels comprising the Admiralty V class were ordered in July 1916 under the 9th War Programme as repeats of the Admiralty V-class leaders (ordered three months earlier) to counter the threat posed by reports of a new class of powerful German destroyers (see ). They omitted the flotilla leader function and as such differed in detail from the leader predecessor.

While all 23 ships were completed with two twin torpedo tubes (&quot;Voyager&quot;, which was completed with triple tubes, was an Admiralty W-class unit ordered in December 1916), in 1921 all Admiralty V class had their forward bank replaced by a triple bank, for a total of five torpedoes; and from 1923 onwards most ships had their aft bank (twin tubes) replaced by a triple bank, for a total of six torpedoes, except in &quot;Vimy&quot;, &quot;Vanoc&quot;, &quot;Velox&quot;, &quot;Versatile&quot; and &quot;Vortigern&quot; in which only the forward bank was replaced.

&quot;Vanquisher&quot;, &quot;Vanoc&quot;, &quot;Velox&quot;, &quot;Vehement&quot;, &quot;Venturous&quot;, &quot;Versatile&quot;, &quot;Vimiera&quot;, &quot;Vittoria&quot; and &quot;Vortigern&quot; were built with the ability to be converted into minelayers within 24 hours. For this purpose they would land their torpedo tubes and &quot;Y&quot; gun on the quarterdeck and have screens fitted to protect the mines, of which up to sixty could be carried. They could be distinguished by the permanent mine chutes at the stern.

==Admiralty W class==

The Admiralty W class comprised 21 vessels, all ordered in December 1916 under the 10th War Programme, although the two ships ordered from Yarrow were cancelled in April 1917 and replaced by the orders for two Yarrow S class (&quot;Tomahawk&quot; and &quot;Torch&quot;). The Admiralty W-class ships were a follow on from the Admiralty V class, with minimal changes, primarily in that the triple torpedo tube mounting was now ready and all these vessels shipped two of these mountings from new. They also had a taller mainmast.

==Thornycroft V and W class==

The Thornycroft V and W class were two V class and two W class specials built by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company Limited to Admiralty specifications. They were ordered in pairs six months apart, on 30 July 1916 and 9 December 1916, respectively. They could be recognised by a higher freeboard and shorter mainmast than the Admiralty type and the flat-sided funnels typical of Thornycroft. The large boiler room (two units) was aft with the single unit forward, the fore funnel therefore being narrower. This arrangement was transposed in the Thornycroft Modified W class. The V-class ships had twin torpedo tubes and those of the W-class triple units. The second pair had slightly more displacement and a guaranteed (by contract) speed of 36 knots compared with the 35 knots guaranteed for the first pair. Early in their careers the specified anti-aircraft gun, the QF 2 pounder, was replaced by a single QF 12 pdr 20 cwt Mark I weapon, on a platform between the after funnel and the forward torpedo tubes.

All except &quot;Viscount&quot;, which became a long range escort, were modified to WAIR type fast anti-aircraft escorts. Their conversions were non-standard in that they carried a pair of QF 2 pdr Mark VIII guns on platforms amidships – &quot;en echelon&quot; in &quot;Woolston&quot; only – and that &quot;Viceroy&quot; retained a bank of torpedoes for some time.

==Thornycroft modified W class==

The Thornycroft Modified W class were a private design by Thornycroft based on the Thornycroft V and W class to Admiralty specifications. These two ships were ordered in January 1918, at the same time as the first batch of Modified W class. In these two ships, the position of the boiler rooms was reversed, with the two-boiler room forward and the single unit aft. As a result, the funnel arrangements were transposed, with the thick funnel forwards and the narrow funnel aft. In common with other Thornycroft designs, they had characteristic broad, flat-sided funnels. Like the Admiralty modified ships, the Thornycrofts were up-gunned with the BL 4.7 inch Mark I weapon, and they received triple banks of torpedo tubes from the outset. Another feature of recognition was that the QF 2 pdr guns were mounted &quot;en echelon&quot; amidships, between the funnels.

The completion of &quot;Witch&quot; was delayed by the end of the war, and she was eventually towed to Devonport and completed there at HM Dockyard. Both were converted to the Short Range Escort type during World War II.

==Australian ships==
Four of the above ships along with destroyer leader &quot;Stuart&quot; were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in October 1933. The ships all served in World War II with three being sunk or scuttled during 1941 and 1942. During their war service in the Mediterranean the five transferred ships made up a group that became famous as the Scrap Iron Flotilla.
* &quot;Vampire&quot; (Admiralty V class leader)
* &quot;Vendetta&quot; (Admiralty V class)
* &quot;Voyager&quot; (Admiralty W class)
* &quot;Waterhen&quot; (Admiralty W class)

==Conversions for the Second World War==
From 1937 the disposal of elderly V and W class vessels ceased, and most survivors were converted to fast escort vessels. The onset of the Second World War put a stop to lengthy conversions, but many ships were converted for convoy escort duty.

===Long-range escort===

The V and W class were designed to support the Grand Fleet in its actions in the North Sea, for which they were required to make fairly short, high speed dashes. Thus, they were unsuitable for the Mid-Ocean Escort Force role to which they found themselves allocated in the Second World War, where speeds over 20 knots were of limited value (as ASDIC rapidly lost efficiency) and endurance was desirable over firepower.

To remedy such shortcomings, a number of V and W class were modified into long-range escorts to suit them to this sort of warfare. The small, single-unit boiler room was struck and the resulting space divided into fuel tanks (lower) and accommodation (upper). Not only did this both lower fuel consumption and increase bunkerage, but it provided much needed space for ballooning wartime crews. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; guns were landed and replaced with a Hedgehog ahead-throwing weapon and depth charge stowage and launchers, respectively. The torpedo tubes were replaced with a QF 12 pdr anti-aircraft gun and platforms for a pair of 20 mm Oerlikon guns amidships, with a further pair in the bridge wings. Type 271 target indication radar was added in its distinctive &quot;lantern&quot; dome on the bridge and Type 291 air warning radar was added at the masthead, with High Frequency Direction Finding (HF/DF) fitted in some ships. The maximum speed of the conversions was around .

Converted long-range escorts were (in order of date):

* Vimy (Jan – April 1941)
* Viscount (Jul – Nov 1941)
* Vanessa (Sep 1941 – Jun 1942)
* Winchelsea (Feb – Mar 1942)
* Whitehall (Jun – Jul 1942)
* Volunteer (Aug – Dec 1942)
* Vidette (Oct – Dec 1942)
* Vanquisher (Nov 1942 – Mar 1943)
* Wrestler (Jan – Apr 1943)
* Westcott (Jan – Jun 1943)
* Vesper (Jan – Jul 1943)
* Walker (Feb – Apr 1943)
* Warwick (Feb – Apr 1943)
* Wanderer (Feb – Apr 1943)
* Vansittart (Feb – May 1943)
* Versatile (Feb – Aug 1943)
* Watchman (May – Jul 1943)
* Verity (May – Sep 1943)
* Vanoc (May – Oct 1943)
* Velox (Jan – Apr 1944)

===WAIR===

The WAIR type conversion supplemented the construction of and -class escorts with their emphasis on anti-aircraft capabilities for east coast service (the exact meaning of &#x27;WAIR&#x27; has fallen into obscurity; it is often capitalised suggesting an abbreviation or acronym, but it is most likely derived from W-class anti-AIRcraft). The Thornycroft type leader was also given a WAIR conversion, but as a larger ship she also received a quadruple QF 2 pdr Mark VII mounting.

Converted ships were cleared to the main deck level, leaving only the funnels and after shelter deckhouse. The armament was replaced with four QF 4 inch L/45 Mark XVI guns in two twin mountings HA/LA Mark XIX, shipped on the fore and aft main decks. The armament was controlled by a Mark II(W) rangefinder - director, fitted with Type 285 radar for target ranging as soon as it became available. A new tower bridge, reminiscent of the Hunt class, was built and the metric Radar Type 286 air warning was added at the foremast head, replaced by Type 291 radar as it became available. The armament was completed by a pair of quadruple 0.5 inch Vickers machine guns on a platform amidships, although sometimes single QF 2 pdr Mark VIII were carried in lieu. These guns were generally sided, but a number of ships had them arranged &quot;en echelon&quot; to allow cross-deck fire. These light weapons proved to be generally ineffective and were replaced by the 20 mm Oerlikon gun as it became available, although other ships took priority and the older weapons were carried well into 1942 in some cases. Two racks and throwers for depth charges were carried aft, principally for self-defence purposes, although &quot;Viceroy&quot; sank off the east coast of Scotland on 16 April 1945.

Ships were allocated new L-series (escort) pennant numbers upon re-commissioning:
* &quot;Vanity&quot; (L38)
* &quot;Valentine&quot; (L69)
* &quot;Valorous&quot; (L00)
* &quot;Vega&quot; (L41)
* &quot;Verdun&quot; (L93)
* &quot;Vimiera&quot; (L29)
* &quot;Vivien&quot; (L33)
* &quot;Viceroy&quot; (L21)
* &quot;Westminster&quot; (L40)
* &quot;Whitley&quot; (L23)
* &quot;Winchester&quot; (L55)
* &quot;Wolfhound&quot; (L56)
* &quot;Wolsey&quot; (L02)
* &quot;Woolston&quot; (L49)
* &quot;Wryneck&quot; (L04)

===Short-range escort===
The remaining V and W class were not given either of the former conversions as they were either early war losses, had the valuable BL 4.7 inch main gun or had the modified boiler arrangements of the Thornycroft and Admiralty modified designs with the small room aft. This latter feature proved unsuitable for the long-range escort conversion. Thus, these ships were known as Short-range escorts.

The conversion was generally limited to adding more role-specific armaments and new technology as it became available. Additions were made piecemeal, and ships were often lost with only some, or even none, of the following modifications. In common with most elderly destroyers allocated to escort duties in World War II, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed early in the war and replaced with a single QF 12 pdr A/A gun. They also landed &#x27;Y&#x27; gun to receive additional space for depth charge gear and stowage. Generally, two 20 mm Oerlikons were added in the bridge wings and (when available) replaced the old 2 pounder guns amidships, &#x27;A&#x27; gun was replaced by a Hedgehog weapon and Radar Type 271 target indication was added on the bridge, with Type 286 or 291 air warning fitted at the masthead as and when available. &quot;Walpole&quot;, &quot;Windsor&quot;, &quot;Witshed&quot; and &quot;Wivern&quot; received an army-pattern semi-automatic twin QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun in &#x27;A&#x27; position for East Coast anti-E boat work.

The following vessels were short range escorts (one vessel was allocated a new pennant number in the L – escort – series):
* &quot;Venomous&quot;
* &quot;Vivacious&quot;
* &quot;Vortigern&quot;
* &quot;Walpole&quot;
* &quot;Windsor&quot; (L94)
* &quot;Veteran&quot;
* &quot;Whitshed&quot;
* &quot;Wild Swan&quot;
* &quot;Wishart&quot;
* &quot;Witch&quot;
* &quot;Witherington&quot;
* &quot;Wivern&quot;
* &quot;Wolverine&quot;

==V and W class in fiction==
* HMS &quot;Viperous&quot; is the name of a fictional V and W-class destroyer in the novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; by Nicholas Monsarrat, the leader of an escort group including &quot;Compass Rose&quot;, the focus of the first part of the story.
* HMS &quot;Warlock&quot; is the name of the leader of a flotilla of eight fictional destroyers in the 1974 novel &quot;The Destroyers&quot; by Douglas Reeman. Seven of these are V and W-class destroyers (HMS &quot;Ventnor&quot;, HMS &quot;Victor&quot;, HMS &quot;Warden&quot;, HMS &quot;Warlock&quot;, HMS &quot;Waxwing&quot;, HMS &quot;Whiplash&quot; and HMS &quot;Whirlpool&quot;); the eighth, HMS &quot;Lomond&quot;, is explicitly described as being a newer and larger destroyer than the other seven.
* HMS &quot;Vagabond&quot; is the name of an apparently fictional V and W-class destroyer in the 1989 novel &quot;The Fighting Spirit&quot; by Charles Giddey (Wheeler) published by William Collins. In this book&#x27;s fictionalised account of the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation at least 15 actual V and W class ships are mentioned.
* HMS &quot;Virtue&quot; and HMS &quot;Vagrant&quot; are the names of two fictional V and W-class destroyers in Ronald Bassett&#x27;s 1977 novel &quot;The Tinfish Run&quot;.
* HMS &quot;Viking&quot; and HMS &quot;Vectra&quot; are two of the escorts of the 14th Aircraft Carrier Squadron in Alistair MacLean&#x27;s novel &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;.
* HMS &quot;Vortex&quot; is the name of a fictional destroyer participating in the 1918 Zeebrügge raid in the 1963 novel &quot;The Admiral&quot; by Warren Tute.
* HMS &quot;Whippet&quot; is the name of a fictional (the real one was canceled) W-class destroyer converted for escort work in the British &quot;Commando War Stories in Pictures&quot; comic #669, titled &quot;Destroyer!&quot;, published in 1972.

<text>Pulsa deNura, Pulsa diNura or Pulsa Denoura () is a purportedly ancient Kabbalistic ceremony in which the destroying angels are invoked to block heavenly forgiveness of the subject&#x27;s sins, allegedly causing all the curses named in the Bible to befall him resulting in his death. It is controversial for having been allegedly invoked against several contemporary political figures, including by Yosef Dayan against Yitzchak Rabin before his assassination.

Its historicity has been questioned. In &quot;Mishpacha&quot;, a Haredi magazine, Dr. Dov Schwartz of Bar-Ilan University and the Haredi public figure Moshe Yehuda Blau argued that the ceremony has no basis in traditional Judaism and actually originates in mid-20th century.

==Etymology==
&quot;Pulsā&quot;, plural: &quot;pulsē&quot;, is an Aramaic noun derived from the Latin word &quot;pulsus&quot; &quot;blow, stroke&quot;. &quot;Nurā&quot; is an Aramaic noun meaning &quot;the fire.&quot;

==Sources==
The phrase &quot;pulsa dinura&quot; appears in several stories in classical rabbinic literature (though not with the meaning of a mystical curse):
* A restless sinner told Rabbi Akiva that angels were beating him with a stick of fire in punishment for his sins; upon which Rabbi Akiva found the sinner&#x27;s son, educated him, and in that son&#x27;s merit the father was spared.
* God punished the angel Metatron with &quot;pulsei denura&quot; for having misled Elisha ben Abuyah.
* God punished the angel Gabriel with &quot;pulsei denura&quot; for lacking the sensitivity to abbreviate his report on his part in the destruction of Jerusalem.
* Elijah was punished in heaven with &quot;pulsei denura&quot; for having disclosed a heavenly secret to humankind. 
* Rava said that if Levi ben Sisi were alive, he would strike with &quot;pulsei denura&quot; another rabbi who had misrepresented his opinion.
* The term is mentioned once in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, where it is described as a heavenly punishment against a person who does not fulfill their religious obligations.

Some adherents of Kabbalah developed the idea of invoking a curse against a sinner, which they termed &quot;pulsa deNura&quot;. The source for this modern ritual is not to be found in Kabbalah, but among the Hebrew magical manuals of antiquity, such as &quot;Sefer HaRazim&quot; and &quot;The Sword of Moses&quot;.

==Recent usage==
Accusations of the use of this curse by religious Jews against Jewish figures who have committed major transgressions has been made often over the past 50 years and quoted mostly in Israeli media. As the saying goes in Israel &quot;you have not made it in Israeli politics until you&#x27;ve been cursed by the Pulsa DiNura.&quot;

Early in the 20th century, Haredi Jews in Jerusalem were accused by the media of having recited the curse against the linguist Eliezer Ben Yehuda. However, there is no proof of the curse being performed before 1948.

There have been unsubstantiated media reports of the curse being recited against archaeologists and authors.

Prior to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, there were reports that the curse had been recited against him. On 26 February 2012, Tamar Yonah of &quot;Arutz Sheva&quot; interviewed Yosef Dayan, who, with rabbinical guidance, was involved in the Pulsa DiNura of Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon.

Avigdor Eskin, a member of the Gush Emunim (&quot;Bloc of the Faithful&quot;), claimed to have recited the following maledictions of the Pulsa diNura on the night of 2 October 1995:
This was preceded by a similar ceremony in Safed. Rabin was assassinated within the month by an Israeli ultranationalist named Yigal Amir.

In July 2005, the Israeli media, without citing sources, reported that opponents of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza recited the Pulsa deNura in the old cemetery of Rosh Pina, asking the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; to kill Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Six months later Sharon suffered two strokes and was in a coma, fighting for his life, until his death on 11 January 2014. However, most analysts link this to his age (77) and obesity.

On 7 November 2006, the Edah HaChareidis said it was considering placing the curse on the organizers of the Pride parade scheduled to march in Jerusalem on 10 November 2006. Army Radio interviewed Rabbi Shmuel Papenheim, who announced, &quot;The Rabbinical Court has held a special session and discussed placing a &#x27;pulsa denura&#x27; on those who have had a hand in organizing the march.&quot; Papenheim, editor of the Haredi religious umbrella organization&#x27;s weekly magazine, added that the rabbis were also considering placing the curse &quot;against the policemen who beat Haredi Jews&quot;.

On 1 June 2021, &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; reported that a member of the Health Ministry panel that had been advising on COVID-19 vaccinations received death threats including the Pulsa DiNura during the process of approval for the inoculation of children.

On 10 June 2021, Naftali Bennett, leader of the Yamina party and prime minister designate in the incoming national unity government, reportedly received a letter stating that the Pulsa DiNura had been invoked against him in 2013. The letter was unsigned but reportedly referenced ultra-Orthodox rabbis.

On 12 August 2022, Ukrainian Jewish oligarch Hennadiy Korban said he has performed the Pulsa Denura “&quot;death curse&quot;” against Russian President Vladimir Putin.

<text>The UNISERVO tape drive was the primary I/O device on the UNIVAC I computer. It was the first tape drive for a commercially sold computer.

The UNISERVO used metal tape: a thin strip of nickel-plated phosphor bronze (called Vicalloy) 1200 feet long. These metal tapes and reels were very heavy with a combined weight of 25lbs. Data was recorded in eight channels on the tape (six for the data value, one parity channel for error checking, and one timing channel) at a density of 128 bits per inch. The tape could be moved at 100 inches per second, giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 characters per second. Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second.

The UNISERVO supported both forward and backward modes on read or write operation. This offered significant advantages in data sorting and merging applications. The data transfers to/from the UNIVAC I processor were fully buffered in a single block dedicated memory, permitting instruction execution in parallel with tape movement and data transfer. The internal serial data path permitted inserting a tape data block into main memory in one instruction.

UNIVAC continued to use the name UNISERVO for later models of tape drive (e.g., UNISERVO II, UNISERVO IIIC, UNISERVO VIII-C) for later computers in their product line. The UNISERVO II could read metal tapes from the UNIVAC I as well as use higher-density PET film base/ferric oxide media tapes that became the industry standard. While UNIVAC was first with computer tape, and had higher performance than contemporary IBM tape drives, IBM was able to set the data interchange standard. UNIVAC was later forced to be compatible with the IBM technology.

==Technical details==
The tape motion in the UNISERVO I was controlled by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. Supply and take-up reel motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to the invention of the vacuum column buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a connector link to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes.

The later UNISERVO IIA and IIIA omitted the plastic wear tape and felt wipers, since they were primarily used with PET film-base magnetic tape. Both continued the use of single capstan drives and were vacuum column designs. The IIIC and later tapes used NRZI encoding to be compatible with the IBM 729 series tape drives which set the industry standard for data interchange. Ironically, IBM then later switched to phase encoding in its 1600-bit-per-inch tape generation because of its superior data reliability.

<text>Malolos , officially the City of Malolos (), is a component city and capital of the province of Bulacan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 261,189 people. It is the capital city of the province of Bulacan as the seat of the provincial government.

Malolos was the site of the constitutional convention of 1898, known as the Malolos Convention, that led to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic led by Emilio Aguinaldo, at the sanctuary of the Barasoain Church. The convent of the Malolos Cathedral served as the presidential palace at that time. The First Philippine Republic is sometimes characterized as the first proper constitutional republic in Asia, although there were several Asian republics predating it – for example, the Mahajanapadas of ancient India, the Lanfang Republic, the Republic of Formosa, or the Republic of Ezo. Aguinaldo himself had led a number of governments prior to Malolos, like those established at Tejeros and Biak-na-Bato which both styled themselves &quot;República de Filipinas&quot; (&quot;Republic of the Philippines&quot;). Unlike the founding documents of those governments, however, the Malolos Constitution was duly approved by a partially elected congress and called for a true representative democracy.

==History==
Miguel Lopez de Legazpi conquered the 8 villages along Malolos River and integrated it into one entity dated November 14, 1571, and constituted it as an Encomienda de Malolos the Adelantado entrusted the settlements to conquistador Don Marcos de Herrera. On April 5, 1572, Legazpi merges the encomiendas of Malolos and Calumpit into a single entity to form a new town of Calumpit with Juan Moron and Herrera as co-encomenderos.

On April 15, 1572, Legazpi entrusted 6 villages along Atlag River and given it to Don Jeronimo Tirado.

Nine years later, Malolos was officially established as a town and included it in Bulacan and dismembered on Alcaldia de Calumpit on June 11, 1580, and accepted as priory with Fray Matheo de Mendoza as its first minister in an Augustinian Council held in Tondo Convent but the civil administration still belongs to its encomendero at that time, Don Jeronimo Tirado.

The Tagalog constituted the majority of the Malolos populace although it is said that the town had a Kapampangan origin; the name Malolos is a Spanish pronunciation of Kapampangan word &quot;maluslús.&quot; They were led by prominent families, among them are descendants of the royal clans of Gatbontons, Gatmaitan, Gatsalian (Gatchalian), Dimagiba, Lakandola, Ladia and Lacancale and in the 17th-19th centuries, Chinese Filipino families through Tondo and Binondo, such as Chichioco, Cojuangco, Chiong, Chico, Cunanan, Tantocos, Tanchangco, Tanjosoy, Tengco, Tenjeco, Tiongson, Lomotan, Manahan, joined by Spanish Filipino families of Adriano, Bautista, Jacinto, Reyes, Santos, Rustia, de Leon, Agustin, Vasquez, Valenzuela, Crisostomo and Estrella.

Chinese Filipino traders settled in Malolos starting in 1670 for economic opportunity. The settlers increased, and Malolos began engaging with textile, rice production. However, the Chinese are expelled from the town on June 30, 1755, due to political and social issues.

On August 31, 1859, Malolos was divided into three independent towns; &quot;Malolos&quot;, &quot;Barasoain, and &quot;Santa Isabel&quot;. These new towns are former districts of Malolos, with own respective Presidente Municipal and Parish priests. With the beginning of American rule in 1903, these towns were again reunited into a single municipality. The two other districts became barangays under the political jurisdiction of Malolos.

A major factor in the progress of Malolos was the opening of the Manila–Dagupan railways in April 1892.

Malolos was first organized into a formal municipal unit in 1822 when the first &quot;alcalde constitucional&quot; or municipal head was appointed. He was Jorge de Victoria, a Filipino, who like all succeeding &quot;alcaldes&quot;, served for one year. He was followed by thirty-one other &quot;alcaldes&quot;, with Juan Dimagiba as the thirty-first. In 1859, Malolos was subdivided into three administrative districts; Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Juan Dimagiba became the first &quot;alcalde&quot; of the down-scaled Malolos. There were 12 others who served as &quot;alcaldes&quot; from 1859 to 1879, the first one being Mariano C. Cristobal and the second being Capitan Tomas Tanchanco, whose term marked the start of civil turmoil in the town.

===Philippine Republic===


Malolos is the historical site of the constitutional convention of 1898 that led to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic, the first republic in Asia, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. Malolos served as the capital of the short-lived republic from 1898 to 1899. In 1899, after the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Scientifico Literaria de Filipinas was established in Malolos, Bulacan. It offered Law as well as Medicine, Surgery and Notary Public; Academia Militar,(the Philippine&#x27;s First Military School) which was established on October 25, 1898; and The Burgos Institute, (the Philippine&#x27;s first law school) and an exclusive school for boys.

The Congress of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines convened in Barasoain Church in Malolos on September 15, 1898. On the 18th, Aguinaldo proclaimed Malolos as the capital of the Philippines. The first important act of the Congress was the ratification on September 29, 1898, of the independence proclamation at Kawit, Cavite of June 12, 1898. On October 19, 1898, by virtue of an act of Congress, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established. It was in Malolos on December 20, 1898, when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo declared December 30 of every year as a day of national mourning. The greatest achievement and for which the Malolos Congress was known was the framing of the Malolos Constitution, prepared by a committee headed by Felipe Calderón, was approved by the congress after amendments have been made on January 20, 1899, sanctioned by Aguinaldo the next day and promulgated on January 22. The last congressional act of the Malolos Congress was the inauguration of the Philippine Republic with Aguinaldo as the President on January 23, 1899, amidst the people&#x27;s jubilation.

On March 31, 1899, at the height of the Philippine–American War, Aguinaldo ordered Gen. Antonio Luna to set the Malolos Church including its huge silver altar on fire as part of their strategy called &quot;Scorched-earth Policy&quot; where everything will be rendered useless. Malolos was destroyed when the Americans captured the capital. Aguinaldo escaped to San Fernando, Pampanga before the American Forces arrived at Malolos.

===Malolos as the capital of Bulacan===

More than a year after the 1899 Battle of Malolos and the victory of and occupation by American forces, the national seat of power was officially conferred again to Manila and on February 27, 1901, by the virtue of Act No. 88 of the Philippine Commission, the commission officially transferred the provincial seat from the heavily damaged town of Bulakan to the nearby town of Malolos and it became the capital of Bulacan. On January 12, 1904, by virtue of Act No. 1038, the former municipalities of Barasoain and Santa Isabel were merged with Malolos, with Barasoain designated as the municipal seat.

The Casa Presidencia de Malolos was converted as the new Casa Real of Bulacan (became Casa Real Shrine) making it as the new Official Office and Residence of Governor until 1930 when the new Provincial Capitol Building in Barrio Guinhawa, also in Malolos was built.
===Governments of Malolos after the Philippine–American War===
*&quot;During the American Period&quot; &lt;br&gt; After the War, the Americans appointed a martial law administrator in the person of Jose Reyes Tiongson. He served as &quot;presidente politico militar&quot; from 1901 to 1902. With the capture of Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela and the defeat of most of the Filipino armed forces all over the country, the Americans began to put up a network of local government units. The municipality of Malolos was re-organized, composed of the districts of Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Appointed &quot;presidente municipal&quot; or town mayor was Ramon Gonzalez de Leon of Sitio Tampoy, one of the original members of the Katipunan Balangay Apuy. He was in the post for two years, 1903 to 1905. He and the nine others who followed him were all appointive officials. When the Philippines became a commonwealth, Leon Valencia was elected mayor in 1937, the first ever elected. Diosdado Dimagiba succeeded him in 1940 but had to vacate the position because of the Japanese conquest. Also in this period, the Malolos Municipal Hall facing the Malolos Church was built, in a manner of Neo-Classical Roman Style.
*&quot;During the Japanese Occupation&quot; &lt;br&gt; The Japanese appointed two &quot;punong bayan&quot; or mayors, Luis Peralta and Ignacio Tapang. After the joint US and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces liberated Malolos in March 1945, Adonis P. Maclang of the guerrillas&#x27; Bulacan Military Area was appointed guerrilla mayor of the town, before battle for the liberation of Bulacan, the local Filipino forces of the 3rd and 32nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated in Malolos to helping the local guerrilla resistance fighters of the Bulacan Guerrilla Unit and American troops of the U.S. Army against the Japanese in 1945 at the end of World War II, followed by the appointment of Isberto Crisostomo as civilian town mayor in 1946. The first post-war election was held in 1946 and Carlos Maclang was elected mayor.

===Contemporary history===
On June 30, 1998, Malolos was the site again for another presidential inauguration, this time of Joseph Estrada when he was inaugurated at Barasoain Church as the 13th President of the Philippines. Estrada, whose real surname is Ejercito, traced his ancestry to the Ejercitos who were prominent in the history of Malolos.
The construction of the Malolos flyover in summer of 2004 marked a new milestone being the first in the city. The structure, part of the former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s Bridge Program, was constructed in a record-breaking 60 days only according to the Department of Public Works and Highways. The structure was built to solve daily traffic jams, which have become a bane to motorists and to employees in both private and government offices in the city. This remarkable feat hastened not only the city&#x27;s development in commerce and trade but also that of its neighboring municipalities as well.

On July 28–30, 2008, the city hosted the first National Conference for Philippine-Spanish Relations. This is a project of both the Province of Bulacan&#x27;s research arm, the Center for Bulacan Studies of Bulacan State University, and by the Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan, Incorporated.
=== Cityhood ===

In February 1999, Bulacan&#x27;s 1st congressional district representative Wilhelmino Sy-Alvarado authored a bill converting the then-municipality of Malolos into a component city, which was approved as &quot;Republic Act No. 8754&quot; on November 4. The plebiscite for the ratification, along with that for Tuguegarao, Cagayan (whose cityhood was approved through &quot;RA No. 8755&quot;), was scheduled on December 18.

A plebiscite was conducted in 402 precincts in 51 &quot;barangays&quot;; wherein residents rejected the cityhood bid. However, it was marred by a number of alleged irregularities including improper counting of votes; the reason mayor Restituto Roque, along with two other individuals, on December 29, filed an electoral protest before the Commission on Elections, seeking the nullification of the plebiscite results and asking for a recount.

After a recount, on October 8, 2002, the COMELEC Second Division, favoring the petition, declared the ratification of the charter and reversed the earlier official vote count, through its Resolution on &quot;Election Protest Case No. 99–2&quot;. It was said that several ballots were written by a person, while others were missing.

Malolos eventually became the second town in Bulacan to be a city, following San Jose del Monte. Danilo Domingo, who had opposed the cityhood and defeated Roque in the 2001 elections, became the first city mayor.

In 2010, the city government, through the &quot;City Ordinance No. 24-2010&quot;, declared December 18 of every year to be the celebration of the cityhood.

===Invalidation of the Lone District of Malolos Act===
Legislative bills were filed in the 14th Congress in 2007 to create a separate, lone legislative district for Malolos. &quot;House Bill No. 3162&quot; was filed on November 27, 2007 by Bulacan first district representative Ma. Victoria Sy-Alvarado; it was converted to &quot;HB No. 3693&quot;, filed on March 4, 2008, also by Sy-Alvarado, and was passed by the House of Representatives on April 29. Meanwhile, &quot;Senate Bill No. 1986&quot;, filed on December 19, 2007 by Senator Mar Roxas. On October 6, 2008, the same day the committee report was issued, the bill was sponsored by Senator Benigno Aquino III and co-sponsored by Senators Roxas and Richard Gordon. The bill was passed by the Senate on February 16, 2009.

On May 1, 2009, the bill lapsed into law as &quot;Republic Act No. 9591&quot; without the president&#x27;s signature, amending the city charter (&quot;RA No. 8754&quot;).

In August, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issued &quot;Resolution No. 09-0544&quot;, on the allocation of a legislative district for Malolos, concerning the said law.

However, on June 16, four individuals from the city had filed a petition, with the COMELEC as respondent, questioning the constitutionality of &quot;RA No. 9591&quot; which violated the 1987 Constitution and its Ordinance; both require a population of at least 250,000 for a city to have its own representative in Congress.

On January 25, 2010, the Supreme Court voted, 7–6, to grant the petition, nullifying &quot;RA No. 9591&quot;. The court cited the failure to show official records that the city&#x27;s population would reach that number in time for the May elections.

At the time the legislative bills were filed, the city&#x27;s population was 223,069. The court explained that &quot;HB No. 3693&quot; cited an undated erroneous certification certification on demographic projections, issued by an unauthorized National Statistics Office personnel; while they used the city&#x27;s annual population growth rate of 3.78% between 1995 and 2000 as basis for the law, their projected population in 2010 would be at least fifty thousand more than what is required, contrary to the court&#x27;s projection that the required number would be reached only by August.

The ruling was affirmed on March 9. The city was then reverted to Bulacan&#x27;s first legislative district, which also currently comprises five municipalities. At that time, the province was represented in Congress through four districts.

In 2015, Sy-Alvarado filed another bill, &quot;House Bill No. 655&quot;. Domingo, currently serving as district representative, expressed his support.

==Geography==
Malolos is north of Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. It is one of the major suburbs conurbated to Metro Manila, situated in the southwestern part of Bulacan, in the Central Luzon Region (Region 3) in the island of Luzon and part of the Metro Luzon Urban Beltway Super Region.

It is bounded by municipalities of Calumpit on northwest, Plaridel on north, Guiguinto on east, Paombong on west, Bulakan on the southeast and Manila Bay on the south.

===Topography===
Malolos is relatively flat of about 0.81% to a gently sloping of 2.17%. The slope of the land descends towards west, southwest to southern direction. The highest land elevation is at about above sea level while the lowest is only below sea level. A network of natural waterways and rivers of various sizes and importance is traversing through the landscape of the town down south to Manila Bay.

There are three soil types from the major type of Malolos, the soils of the alluvial landscape and these are the Quingua Series, San Manuel Series and the Tagulod Series. Other soil types comprised in the soil map of Malolos are the Matimbo Series and Masantol Series, which belong to the soils of the coastal landscape, Loamy Tidal Swamp and Mucky Tidal Swamp from the miscellaneous soil types.

===Climate===
Malolos belongs to Type 1 category of the Philippine Climate Corona Classification, which has two pronounced seasons, i.e., wet and dry seasons. Wet during the months of June to November and dry from December to May.

The northwest monsoon prevails over the area from October to January bringing in moderate and light rains, the last trade winds predominate from February to April but the high Sierra Madre Mountains interfere with the free circulation of making the area dry with almost no rains during the period, while from May to September the southwest monsoon prevail with strong winds and abundant rainfall, and generally associated with strong typhoon.

===Barangays===
Malolos is politically subdivided into 51 barangays that are spread over a land area of consisting of agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, bodies of water, fishponds, marshes and roads. Many of the name of the barangays were derived from the name of common Philippine trees, because Malolos was once a vast virgin land and forests, before the Spaniards came and Christianized the natives. While others were named in honor of their patron saints.

Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

==Demographics==

As of 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority released the official result of 2015 census in which Malolos has a population of 261,189 people, with a density of , an increase of 17,129 people from the 2010 census. There are 52,547 households in the city. Majority of the Malolos households usually lives along the major roads. It has an average crime rate of 6.28% and has a crime solution efficiency of 97.11%.

===Language and ethnicity===
The majority of the Maloleños (or Malolenyo in Filipino) traces their roots to Tagalog ethnicity although there are also Kapampangan and other ethnicities who migrated to the city. The vernacular language is Filipino, in the form of Tagalog, while Philippine English is the language most widely used in education and business throughout the city. Although Malolos is the city where the Filipinos established the Spanish as their only official language in the first constitution, the native speakers of Spanish still alive are reduced to the very old members of a handful of families.

===Religion===

The Christianization of Malolos was done by the Augustinian Order in May 1572 thru the effort of Fray Diego Vivar-Ordonez (parochial vicar of Calumpit, assistant to Fray Diego Herrera and Martin de Rada) and it became one of the visitas of Parish of Nicolas de Tolentino (became San Juan Bautista in 1576). Since 1572 the apostolic administration in Malolos was under the Convent of Calumpit. On June 11, 1580, the mission chapel was accepted by the Augustinians as House of Order and became &quot;Iglesia Convento y Malolos&quot; with visitas of Paombong, Matimbo, Mambog and Quingua in 1581. Later due to the frequent high tides that submerged the area, the friars moved the church to its present location in Poblacion in 1590 under the curate Fray Cristobal Tarique, where they started to build a church made of light materials and wood. In 1599 Fray Roque de Barrionuevo started to build a church made of stone and it was finished in 1673. The majority of the residents are Christians. Roman Catholic is the predominant religion in the city.

Until today, the Roman Catholic faith in Malolos remained intensive. It is evident through the existence of the three stone churches. (Malolos Cathedral, Barasoain Church, and the Santa Isabel Church)
Being predominantly Catholic, Malolos, together with the whole province of Bulacan is constituted as &quot;Vicaria dela Immaculada Concepcion&quot; in which the (Cura de Malolos is the Vicar Forane). It was part of the Archdiocese of Manila until March 11, 1962, when Pope John XXIII created the Diocese of Malolos making the Malolos Church its cathedral. In March 2012 the Diocese of Malolos will celebrate its 50th anniversary.
It was highlighted by the Canonical Coronation of the patroness and queen of the city and the whole province, &quot;Virgen Inmaculada Concepción de Malolos&quot; enshrined at the cathedral&#x27;s altar.

Other Christian religious groups, such as Methodists, Aglipayans, Adventists, Baptists, Mormons, and other Protestant churches, as well as Nontrinitarian churches (like Members Church of God International, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness) can be found in the city.

Islam (Muslims) could also be found in the city.

== Economy ==
=== Commerce ===
The City of Malolos is quickly becoming commercialized due to its proximity to Metro Manila and for lying between Manila and Clark, Pampanga. Many corporations have put up commercial sites and banking establishments in various places around the city. Many of the businesses and industries in the city include Banking; Business Process Outsourcing; Courier Service; Education; Food Service; Hospitals; Hotels, Resorts &amp; Restaurants; Information and Communications Technology; Insurance; Manpower; ; Realty/Real Property Development; Trade; Transport Services; Travel &amp; Tours; and other services. Robinsons Place Malolos is a major shopping mall owned and operated by Robinsons Malls, the Philippines&#x27; second largest mall operator. The mall is located along MacArthur Highway, Barangay Sumapang Matanda. Other shopping malls in Malolos include the Maunlad Malls 1 and 2, both owned and operated by the Union Bank of the Philippines, Graceland Mall, owned and operated by RMR Group of Companies, Vista Mall, Waltermart and Bulacan Eco-Commercial Complex, owned by the Provincial Government of Bulacan.

Chimera Land is an amusement park under construction located in Barangay Sumapang Matanda. Once complete, it will be the first sustainable themed park in the Philippines.

Malolos also serves as the Banking Capital of Bulacan, having the highest number of banking institutions in the province (the city hosts around 46), majority of these are located prominent areas of the city, particularly along Paseo del Congreso Avenue.

=== Industry ===

Due to its close proximity in Manila and its port, Malolos becomes industrialized. Industrial estates, such as First Bulacan Industrial City, where are more than 20 corporations and companies operating their factories inside the estate are a boom. Mighty Corporation, a major player in the Philippine tobacco industry, operates a tobacco factory in the city.

Other industries such as agribusiness, aquaculture, bag making, ceramics, construction, cement making, flowers/ornamentals, furniture, food processing, garments, gifts, houseware making, decor making, jewelry, leather tanning, marble polishing, metallurgy, printing, shoe manufacturing, and textile manufacturing are also present in the city.

Some of the food products produced in Malolos include &quot;Empanada de Kaliskis&quot;, Ensaymada Malolos, Inipit, Otap Bread, Atsara, and Bagoong.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Public transportation in Malolos is served by buses, jeepneys, and UV Express AUVs. The city is also served by Tricycles, which offer their services on a for-hire basis. A bus stop located in Malolos Crossing is served by provincial buses operated by Baliwag Transit, First North Luzon Transit, and Victory Liner to Cubao and Monumento. Robinsons Place Malolos is the terminus of Point-to-point buses from Trinoma, and modernized jeepneys from San Fernando, Pampanga.

Malolos is known for its Karatig Jeepneys which serves as an intra-city public transportation. The name itself came from the word &quot;karatig&quot;, which means nearby places or barangays. The Karatig jeepney is the smaller version of the jeepneys which usually have the size of about 3-meters long and can board 8-10 commuters at the back plus 2 passengers in the front seat.

The project was worth $421,050,000. However, on February 13, 2006, a controversy arose from the project and the project was placed on halt indefinitely. In 2017, the project was revived and was called North South Commuter Railway with funds sourced from Japan through a loan. On January 5, 2018, the Department of Transportation broke ground for the first phase of the PNR Clark Line. The New of the is currently being rebuilt as part of the project.

When re-opened, the Malolos Station will serve as the temporary terminus until the completion of PNR Clark 2.

<text>The Swanson River (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Yaghetnu&quot;) is a stream, long, on the Kenai Peninsula of south-central Alaska in the United States. Beginning at Gene Lake in the Swanson Lakes district, it flows southwest then north to Number Three Bay on the Gompertz Channel of Cook Inlet.

The majority of the river&#x27;s course lies within the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. In its lower reaches, it passes through the Swanson River Oil Field east of Nikiski before turning sharply north. Near its mouth, it flows through Captain Cook State Recreation Area and under Kenai North Road to enter Cook Inlet.

==Recreation==
Swanson River and the many lakes around it are popular places for trips in light canoes and kayaks. Two canoe trails involve lakes and streams rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. The Swan Lake Route of includes 30 lakes with portages of up to . The Swanson River Route, long, crosses 40 lakes and requires portages of up to a mile. The portages, which may cross swampy ground, vary from easy to difficult. In addition to boggy terrain, hazards include wind-driven waves, mosquitoes, and a dearth of good campsites.

It is possible to float the Swanson River itself from the outlet at Gene Lake to the North Kenai Road bridge. A shorter float goes by river from Gene Lake to Swanson River Landing near Swan Lake Road and the Rainbow Lake Campground.

The Swanson system of lakes and streams supports large populations of game fish. The main species are silver salmon, rainbow trout, and Arctic char and Dolly Varden.

<doc id="988426" wikidata="Q7696463" url="?curid=988426" title="Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991">
<text>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) was passed by the United States Congress in 1991 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush as Public Law 102-243. It amended the Communications Act of 1934. The TCPA is codified as . The TCPA restricts telephone solicitations (i.e., telemarketing) and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits companies or debt collectors from calling clients or prospective customers using automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages, and fax machines. It also specifies several technical requirements for fax machines, autodialers, and voice messaging systems—principally with provisions requiring identification and contact information of the entity using the device to be contained in the message.

== General provisions ==
Unless the recipient has given prior express consent, the TCPA and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules under the TCPA generally:

* Prohibits solicitors from calling residences before 8 a.m. or after 9 pm, local time.
* Requires solicitors maintain a company-specific &quot;do-not-call&quot; (DNC) list of consumers who asked not to be called; the DNC request must be honored for 5 years.
* Requires solicitors honor the National Do Not Call Registry.
* Requires solicitors provide their name, the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made, and a telephone number or address at which that person or entity may be contacted.
* Prohibits solicitations to residences that use an artificial voice or a recording.
* Prohibits any call made using automated telephone equipment or an artificial or prerecorded voice to an emergency line (e.g., &quot;911&quot;), a hospital emergency number, a physician&#x27;s office, a hospital/health care facility/elderly room, a cellular telephone, or any service for which the recipient is charged for the call.
* Prohibits autodialed calls that engage two or more lines of a multi-line business.
* Prohibits unsolicited advertising faxes.
* In the event of a violation of the TCPA, a subscriber may (1) sue for up to $500 for each violation or recover actual monetary loss, whichever is greater, (2) seek an injunction, or (3) both.
* In the event of a willful violation of the TCPA, a subscriber may sue for up to three time the damages, i.e. $1,500, for each violation.
When Congress passed the TCPA in 1991, it delegated the do-not-call rules to the FCC. Congress suggested that the FCC&#x27;s do-not-call regulations &quot;may require the establishment and operation of a single national database.&quot; The FCC did not adopt a single national database but rather required each company to maintain its own do-not-call database. The FCC&#x27;s initial do-not-call list regulations were ineffective at proactively stopping unsolicited calls because the consumer had to make a do-not-call request for each telemarketer. In 2003, even though the FCC was the agency entrusted with the TCPA, it was the Federal Trade Commission that established the National Do Not Call Registry and implemented regulations prohibiting commercial telemarketers from making unsolicited sales calls to persons who did not wish to receive them. After being challenged in court by the telemarketing industry, the National Do Not Call Registry received Congressional ratification in the speedy enactment of Do-Not-Call Implementation Act. In 2013, the Philadelphia Federal Appeals Court held that consent to receive calls from collectors, banks, or telemarketers to consumers&#x27; cell phones may be revoked by the consumer.

The CAN-SPAM Act made a minor amendment to the TCPA to explicitly apply the TCPA to calls and faxes originating from outside the U.S.

The portions of the TCPA related to unsolicited advertising faxes were amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005.

In February 2024, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling that speech synthesis via generative audio (deepfakes) is considered an &quot;artificial&quot; voice for the purposes of the TCPA.

==Unusual statutory provision==
Though the TCPA is a federal statute, suits brought by consumers against violators are frequently filed in state courts. The TCPA is unusual in that the language creating a private right of action led to conflicting views on whether the federal courts had federal question subject matter jurisdiction. The TCPA provides in relevant part: &quot;A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State. ...&quot; Prior to January 2012, there was a circuit split among the federal appeals courts on the issue of whether federal courts have federal question, diversity jurisdiction (individually or under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005), or whether the state courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In 2012, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC&quot;, which resolved the circuit split by concluding that &quot;The TCPA&#x27;s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does not deprive the U.S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.&quot;

==Major court cases==
The TCPA&#x27;s constitutionality was challenged by telemarketers soon after it was enacted. Two cases, &quot;Moser v. FCC&quot;, 46 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 1995) cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1161 (1995) and &quot;Destination Ventures Ltd. v. FCC&quot;, 46 F.3d 54 (9th Cir. 1995) effectively settled this issue finding the restrictions in the TCPA were constitutional.

The Ninth Circuit held that the TCPA applies to unsolicited cellular telephone text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services as &quot;calls&quot; made in violation of the act: In June 2007, a ruling (later overturned) was handed down in class action case Satterfield v. Simon &amp; Schuster, No. C 06-2893 CW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46325 (N.D. Cal. June 26, 2007), a case involving the transmission of SMS text messages promoting a popular author&#x27;s &quot;mobile club&quot; to cellular phones, such as the one used by a seven-year-old child. The defendants, the publishing company that contracted for the transmission of the promotional messages and the service provider that actually sent the messages, argued that the named subscriber, the child&#x27;s mother, had consented to the transmission of promotional messages when, to receive a free ringtone, she checked the box in an online form labeled &quot;Yes! I would like to receive promotions from Nextones affiliates and brands...&quot; Judge Claudia Wilken ruled that the SMS text messages are not covered by the TCPA, first, because the manner in which the SMS messages were sent does not fit the statutory definition of an &quot;automatic telephone dialing system,&quot; and second, because the plaintiff had agreed to receive promotional messages under a broadly worded consent provision, executed in connection with the download of a free ringtone.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the potentially 90 million dollar lawsuit against publishing giant Simon &amp; Schuster. A settlement was finally approved by Judge Claudia Wilken on August 6, 2010, which would pay out $175 to each class member who files a claim.

In April 2005 a class action lawsuit against Jamster! was filed. The lawsuit alleges that Jamster! scammed cellular telephone customers through the use of fraudulent and deceptive advertisements. The plaintiffs argue that the ads in question offered one free ring tone to cell phone customers who responded to the ad via text message, but failed to inform users that they would be subscribed to a monthly service. The lawsuit was combined with four others and settled in November 2009.

In August 2014, Capital One Financial Corp., AllianceOne Receivables Management Inc., Leading Edge Recovery Solutions, LLC and Capital Management Services, L.P. entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers&#x27; cellphones without consent. This is the largest proposed cash settlement under the TCPA to date. It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the &quot;prior express written consent&quot; requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.

The United States Supreme Court resolved a significant circuit split to decide that federal courts have federal question subject matter jurisdiction in &quot;Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC&quot;, 565 US 368, 132 S. Ct. 740, 181 L. Ed. 2d 881 (2012).

In 2015, Congress added an exemption to § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) to allow for robocalls related to federally-owed debt collection. This resulted in the Supreme Court case &quot;Barr v. American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc.&quot;, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), which ruled this created a content-based restriction on free speech that failed strict scrutiny, and invalidated the exemption but leaving the rest of the statute in place due to severability.

In January 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found two text messages were enough to obtain Article III standing.

In August 2019, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found a single text message was not enough to obtain Article III standing under TCPA.

In July 2020, the US Supreme Court found the &quot;government-debt&quot; exception to the TCPA was unconstitutional. The &quot;government-debt&quot; exception was added as an amendment to the TCPA in 2015. The case, Barr v. American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc., was brought by political groups that desired to use robocalls for political ads. The court found the TCPA did unconstitutionally favor debt collection speech over political speech and violated the First Amendment.

In July 2020, the Southern District of Texas found a single text message was enough to obtain Article III standing.

In September 2020, the Eastern District of Texas found a single missed call using a localized number was enough trigger Article III standing under TCPA. The court reasoned, &quot;At issue in this case is a missed call, not a single, unsolicited text message. It only takes one glance at a text message to recognize it is for an extended warranty for a car you have never owned or a cruise you have won from a raffle you never entered. A missed call with a familiar area code, on the other hand, is more difficult to immediately dismiss as an automated message.&quot;

In October 2020, the Northern District of Ohio found the TCPA was unconstitutional from 2015 through 2020 due to the &quot;government-debt&quot; exception, which exempted calls made to collect a debt owed or guaranteed by the United States. The defective provision was severed from the TCPA in 2020. The Ohio court reasoned the severance did not apply retroactively, so the court lacked jurisdiction over all claims from 2015 through 2020.

In December 2020, the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that a consumer can revoke consent to be contacted by the holder of a debt, and a third party debt collector calling on behalf of the holder can be held liable for TCPA violations even if the revoked consent was not communicated to the third party debt collector. Specifically the court found &quot;[a] third party debt collection agency is liable for autodialed calls under the TCPA when the consumer has revoked his prior express consent to be called, even when that revocation has not been communicated to the debt collector or the debt collector otherwise fails to confirm the consumer has consented to calls.&quot;

Andrew Perrong, a Philadelphia attorney, has filed at least 45 TCPA lawsuits against a wide variety of businesses, ranging from chimney sweeps and collection agencies to large businesses like Verizon and Citibank. Perrong has demanded tens of thousands of dollars in some cases, and most of his suits are settled quickly. It is unknown how much money Perrong has made from his settlements. His first settlement occurred in 2015 while a senior at La Salle College High School.

In the Supreme Court decision &quot;Facebook v. Duguid&quot; (2021), the Court established that for a device to qualify as an &quot;automatic telephone dialing system&quot;, it must be based on the capacity to store or produce numbers from a random or sequential generator. The case ruled that an automatic system that may phone a user from a stored number but otherwise not generated in a random or sequential way (such as for two-factor authentication) does not meet this definition under the TCPA.

==FCC actions==

Since 2015, the FCC has ordered violators of the TCPA to pay $208.4 million. The sum includes forfeiture orders in cases involving robocalling, Do Not Call Registry and telephone solicitation violations. According to records obtained by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2019, the government had collected $6,790 of that amount.

In March 2021 the FCC issued a fine of $225 million against the Texas-based telemarketers John C. Spiller and Jakob A. Mears, after they made approximately one billion robocalls to people across the country. The pair used business names including Rising Eagle and JSquared Telecom, were responsible for the calls. One of the people involved in the scheme admitted to making &quot;millions&quot; of robocalls per day, even going so far as to go out of his way to call numbers on the Do Not Call list because he believed it would be more profitable to do so.

On June 6, 2023, the FCC imposed a $5,134,500fine against Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, who had used robocalls in swing states to commit voter intimidation during the 2020 United States presidential election. New York District Judge Victor Marrero accused them of specifically targeting areas with large African American populations. The fine was the largest to have ever been imposed under the TCPA.

<doc id="988441" wikidata="Q7275561" url="?curid=988441" title="RAF Shawbury">
<text>Royal Air Force Shawbury,otherwise known as RAF Shawbury, is a Royal Air Force station near the village of Shawbury in Shropshire in the West Midlands of England.

==History==
===The First World War===
The station at Shawbury was first used for military flying training in 1917 by the Royal Flying Corps. No. 29 (Training) Wing formed on 1 September 1917 with three training squadrons, No. 10 Squadron, No. 29 (Australian) (Training) Squadron and No. 67 Squadron. Several different types of aircraft were operated which caused difficulties with training and maintenance. Two of the squadrons combined to form 9 Training Depot Station on 1 March 1918, the other moving to Gloucestershire. Training continued on a more organised basis until the end of the war.

The airfield closed in May 1920 when the strength of the RAF was drastically reduced. The hangars and other buildings were demolished and the land was returned to agricultural use.

===The Second World War===

In February 1938 the station was reactivated as a training establishment, firstly used by No. 11 Service Flying Training School and an Aircraft Storage Unit (ASU) which was operated by No. 27 Maintenance Unit. The airfield also had Relief Landing Grounds at RAF Bridleway Gate and RAF Bratton, with additional satellite landing grounds at RAF Hinstock, RAF Hodnet and RAF Weston Park.

Shawbury primarily prepared pilots for operational squadrons, with the main aircraft being the Airspeed Oxford. In 1944 it became the home of the Central Navigation School, which had moved from RAF Cranage in Cheshire, primarily concerned with improving the standard of air navigation in bombers.

===Postwar===

In 1950, the School of Air Traffic Control moved to Shawbury, combining to form the Central Navigation and Control School.

No. 27 Maintenance Unit continued its aircraft storage and scrapping work at Shawbury until disbandment in July 1972.

Shawbury became home to No. 2 Flying Training School in 1976, tasked with basic and advanced helicopter training and operating the Aerospatiale Gazelle and Westland Wessex in those roles respectively.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
No. 2 Flying Training School was disbanded in March 1997 so that in April 1997 the station could start providing training of helicopter pilots for all three of the UK&#x27;s armed services, under the newly formed Defence Helicopter Flying School.

Between 2001 and 2014 Shawbury was home to the Assault Glider Trust, a charity building a non-flying replica Horsa glider for museum display.

The station&#x27;s physical recreation training centre, named the Jubilee Hall Sports and Fitness Centre to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, was opened by Prince Michael of Kent on 24 April 2012.

In April 2016 the Central Air Traffic Control School (CATCS) was renamed the School of Air Operations Control (SAOC) and came under the control of the newly created Defence College of Air and Space Operations.

=== Transition to Juno ===
In 2016, the Ministry of Defence selected Ascent Flight Training to deliver the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS), a 25-year contract to provide fixed-wing elementary, basic, multi-engine and fast-jet pilot training, rear crew training and helicopter training to the UK military. Subsequently, Ascent selected Airbus Helicopters to supply thirty-two helicopters to replace the DHFS Squirrel and Griffin aircraft. Airbus provided twenty-nine H135 airframes, known as Juno HT1 and three H145 airframes, known as Jupiter HT1. Due to the reduced requirement for search and rescue (SAR) training, following the privatisation of SAR provision, only three of the larger H145 aircraft are required, compared to the larger number of Griffins which were operated. The new fleet is entirely twin-engine, replacing the single engine Squirrel, as nearly all helicopters now operated by the UK military are twin-engined, apart from the Gazelle AH1, which is due for retirement.

During 2016 and 2017, refurbishment of existing and construction of new buildings was undertaken as part of the contract. The work was undertaken by Kier Construction and included a new training school building, including space for flight simulators and refurbishment of hangars.

The first two Juno and a Jupiter were delivered to Shawbury on 3 April 2017. Deliveries continue throughout 2017 and early 2018, with the final Juno arriving on 24 May 2018. With the new aircraft achieving full training capability, Squirrel and Griffin operations ceased on 1 April 2018 and the aircraft returned to civilian use.

Other changes included the DHFS becoming a sub-unit of the Shawbury station headquarters, rather than an independent lodger unit, which it had been since in creation in 1997. Two wings were created, 2 Maritime Air Wing (2 MAW) and No. 9 Regiment.

The School of Aerospace Battle Management, part of the Defence College of Air and Space Operations, moved to Shawbury from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland in August 2019.

DHFS was re-badged as No. 1 Flying Training School during February 2020 and continues to provide helicopter training the British armed forces.

==Role and operations==
RAF Shawbury&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;To provide a safe, efficient, and effective airfield base environment; to enable and support, commanded, lodged and parented units; and to deliver wider Defence and RAF tasks as directed&quot;.

The station is home to the School of Air Operations Control.

=== No.1 Flying Training School ===

No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) (formerly the Defence Helicopter Flying School) provides basic helicopter pilot training for the RAF, Royal Navy and Army Air Corps (AAC), as well as foreign and commonwealth countries, using twenty-nine Airbus Juno HT1. No. 1 FTS comprises two main elements, 2 Maritime Air Wing (2 MAW) and No. 9 Regiment. 2 MAW includes No. 660 Squadron of the AAC and 705 Naval Air Squadron and provide basic helicopter flying training. No. 9 Regiment comprises No. 60 Squadron of the RAF and No. 670 Squadron of the AAC in the advanced helicopter flying training. No. 202 Squadron is also part of No. 1 FTS and operates the Airbus Jupiter HT1 at RAF Valley in Wales.

Airbus provides and maintains the helicopters and Babcock and Lockheed Martin have contracts for infrastructure and ground Based Training Equipment. No. has 161 instructors, 102 of which are military and 59 which are civilian. The school is expected to train 286 students per annum.

Four classes per annum year go through Shawbury on six-month Basic Rotary courses, two with 705 NAS and two with No. 660 Squadron AAC. During the initial course students are taught basic rotary-wing skills and emergency handling, including engine-off landings, leading to a first solo flight and a handling check. Students then develop their basic skills into more applied techniques such as non-procedural instrument flying, basic night flying, low-level and formation flying, mountain flying in Snowdonia and an introduction to winching for FAA students, in the advanced phase lasting 8 months.

=== Central Flying School (Helicopter) Squadron ===
The RAF Central Flying School (Helicopter) Squadron provides Qualified Helicopter Instructor and Qualified Helicopter Crewman Instructor (QHI/QHCI) training for Juno and Jupiter. The unit trains crews from all three UK armed services as well as foreign air arms.

=== School of Aerospace Battle Management ===
The School of Aerospace Battle Management, part of the Defence College of Airspace Control, moved to Shawbury from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland in August 2019.

Formerly called the School of Fighter Control (SFC), it was located at RAF Boulmer from 1990 to 2019. Commanded by a Wing Commander, the School of Fighter Control was formed in 1946 and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II awarded the Unit its own badge in 1958, which includes a Torch and Pointer. The school&#x27;s motto is &#x27;Disce ut Dirigas&#x27; which freely translates to &#x27;Learn in order that you may guide.

=== Aircraft Maintenance and Storage Unit ===
Several RAF aircraft types are stored in long-term reserve at RAF Shawbury. These aircraft are stored in four specially de-humidified hangars at different states of readiness and can be brought back into active service if required. Other aircraft types which are no longer required for operational service are also stored pending their disposal. The unit is operated by FB Heliservices, part of Cobham.

<doc id="988448" wikidata="Q4413048" url="?curid=988448" title="Ammar al-Baluchi">
<text>Ammar al-Baluchi or Amar Baloch; born Ali Abdul Aziz Ali on 29 August 1977) is a Pakistani (Balochi) citizen who has been in American custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp since 2006. He was arrested in the Pakistani former capital city of Karachi in 2003 before being transferred; the series of criminal charges against him include: &quot;facilitating the 9/11 attackers, acting as a courier for Osama bin Laden and plotting to crash a plane packed with explosives into the U.S. consulate in Karachi.&quot; He is a nephew of the Pakistani terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who served as a senior official of al-Qaeda between the late 1980s and early 2000s; and a cousin of the Pakistani terrorist Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who played a key role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Philippine Airlines Flight 434 bombing, and the high-profile Bojinka plot.

American authorities have stated that al-Baluchi was a &quot;key lieutenant&quot; of his uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed during al-Qaeda&#x27;s preparation for the 9/11 attacks, and that he had told investigators that he had sought help in al-Qaeda&#x27;s efforts to develop biological weapons to use against enemy forces and other targets. al-Baluchi&#x27;s ex-wife Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani cognitive neuroscientist, was arrested by Afghan police in Ghazni Province in 2008 and subsequently transferred to American custody at FMC Carswell, where she remains incarcerated on terrorism charges. Siddiqui&#x27;s family has denied that she was ever married to al-Baluchi, but the marriage has been attested by Pakistani and American intelligence personnel, Mohammed, and Siddiqui herself.

After being arrested in Karachi, al-Baluchi was transferred to Afghanistan and detained at the Salt Pit, a now-defunct CIA black site near Bagram Airfield. It has been reported that he was tortured extensively, being used as a &quot;training prop&quot; to teach enhanced interrogation techniques to new agents; trainees took turns shoving his head into a wall in sessions that lasted for hours, inflicting considerable brain damage. He was also doused with icy water and kept in stress positions, though these techniques ultimately failed to contribute to the acquisition of any useful intelligence. In 2018, the United Nations released a public announcement stating that al-Baluchi&#x27;s ongoing captivity &quot;breaches human rights law&quot; and called on American authorities to immediately end his arbitrary detention.

==Early life and education==
Ammar al-Baluchi was born in Al Ahmadi, Kuwait, and is the maternal nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (organizer of the 9/11 attacks) and cousin of Ramzi Yousef, the organizer of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The extended family of al-Baluchi is ethnically Baluchi and originally from Balochistan. The family patriarch and his brother were lay Deobandi preachers. They moved the family to Kuwait in the 1960s.

Baluchi grew up in Kuwait but spent most of his teenage years in Iranian Baluchistan. He is a citizen of Pakistan. Trained as a computer technician, he dressed in Western clothes and &quot;introduced himself as a businessman&quot;, but had been &quot;groomed ... since boyhood&quot; by his cousins and uncles &quot;to join their clandestine war,&quot; according to journalist Deborah Scroggins. According to a U.S. government biography, his &quot;chief mentor&quot; was his cousin and 1993 World Trade Center bombing orchestrator Ramzi Yousef, &quot;who taught him in the early 1990s in Iran about the importance of war against the West.&quot;

He is fluent in English and worked at Mohammed&#x27;s honey-processing company in Karachi for a while before being hired in 1998 as a computer technician for &quot;Modern Electronics Corporation&quot; in Dubai. According to some evidence given at the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, he was &quot;very open-minded and western-oriented&quot;, while his ex-wife told investigators he was &quot;a very strict Muslim&quot; who opposed his wife&#x27;s leaving the home.

==Career==
=== Preparation for the 9/11 attacks ===
According to a U.S. government biography, al-Baluchi &quot;volunteered his services&quot; to his uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in 1997.

According to U.S. officials, the majority of money that came to the Saudi hijackers for the September 11 attacks was transferred through al-Baluchi and Mustafa al-Hawsawi.
The 9/11 Commission reported that he &quot;helped them with plane tickets, traveler&#x27;s checks, and hotel reservations&quot;, and &quot;taught them about everyday aspects of life in the West, such as purchasing clothes and ordering food&quot;. In his defence, al-Baluchi claims that he often helped people in Dubai with such things to supplement his income, and he had no way of knowing whether any of them were criminals.

On 10 October 1998, al-Baluchi used his passport to open a bank account with the Emirates Bank International, using the name &quot;Ali&quot; based on his nasab &quot;Ibn Abdulaziz Ali&quot; and listing his employer&#x27;s address with PO box 16958, Jebel Ali, Dubai.

He was then introduced to Marwan al-Shehhi by his uncle, and Shehhi allegedly asked him to help transfer money from Shehhi&#x27;s company in Dubai to his company in the United States, ostensibly to help avoid banking fees if he transferred the money himself.

In January 2000, an order using Shehhi&#x27;s credit card had a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator program, a Boeing 767 flight deck video, and some flight attendant literature and flight manuals shipped to al-Baluchi&#x27;s work address. al-Baluchi then shipped them to his uncle to pass onto Shehhi.

On 18 April, al-Baluchi sent a wire transfer of $5,000 to Adel Rafeea, the administrator of the Islamic Center of San Diego, from the Wall Street Exchange Centre in Dubai, using his PO Box, passport and listing his phone number as 0506745651. Rafeaa later claimed that Nawaf al-Hazmi had asked him to accept the money on his behalf.

Tracing the calls made to al-Baluchi&#x27;s phone number, authorities discovered that he had received 16 calls from 28 to 30 June from a pre-paid Voicestream mobile purchased in Manhattan on 4 June. The phone was deactivated on 11 July, and authorities allege it belonged to Atta, while al-Baluchi insisted that he only ever spoke with Shehhi, who had hired him. Around this time, al-Baluchi complained to Mohammed that he couldn&#x27;t do all this additional work himself, and his uncle told him that Mustafa al-Hawsawi would co-ordinate with him to act as an assistant.

On 29 June, a man named &quot;Isam Mansur&quot; wired $5,000 to the Western Union at 1440 Broadway in New York, where Shehhi picked it up. This is alleged to have been al-Baluchi, since two later direct payments into Shehhi&#x27;s Sun Trust account from the Exchange Center, a $10,000 payment to Shehhi on 18 July from &quot;Isam Mans&quot;u&quot;r&quot; and a $9,500 5 August payment from &quot;Isam Mans&quot;ou&quot;r&quot;, gave al-Baluchi&#x27;s PO Box number.

On 8 August, al-Baluchi opened a bank account at Dubai Islamic Bank, using his name, passport and phone number. A $20,000 payment from al-Baluchi&#x27;s bank account to Shehhi&#x27;s Sun Trust account on 29 August gave a phone number one digit different from the one given by Isam Mansour on 5 August.

A $70,000 payment was made to Shehhi&#x27;s account by &quot;Hani (Fawaz Trading)&quot; on 17 September from the same exchange centre. Hani gave a telephone number one digit removed from the one al-Baluchi used on the transfer from his bank account on 29 August.

In September, Hani Hanjour went to Dubai, where al-Baluchi gave him $3,000 to open a new bank account, and later deposited $5,000 in the account which Hanjour later accessed from ATMs in the United States. When Ahmed al-Ghamdi went to Dubai, al-Baluchi helped him purchase a cell phone. It is believed nine of the hijackers met with him in Dubai and received various levels of aid.

The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; stated that he &quot;relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were essentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the globe.&quot;

On 27 August 2001, al-Baluchi applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a week after his employer announced the closing of their Dubai branch, and the government had sent notices informing the employees their work permits had been rescinded and they had to leave the country. He was declined since he appeared to be an economic immigrant, and instead moved back home to Pakistan a few days before the attacks.

=== Post-9/11 period ===
Moving back in with his parents in Karachi, Pakistan, al-Baluchi saw his uncle several times when he came to visit. According to a short biography written by the United States government&#x27;s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), after the Taliban was initially driven from power after the 9/11 attack, al-Baluchi assisted KSM in organizing the movement of al-Qaeda operatives and their families to safehouses in Pakistan. 
* According to US government information, KSM had Baluchi be the &quot;communications intermediary&quot; between al-Qaeda and &quot;shoe bombers&quot; Richard Reid and Saajid Badat. In early 2002 Baluchi helped his uncle &quot;prepare operatives&quot; for travel from Pakistan to the United States, &quot;ostensibly to carry out attacks&quot;.
* Another plan was to hijack airliners and crash them into London&#x27;s Heathrow airport, but this plan was set aside in order to focus on a plan to bomb the US Consulate and other Western targets in Karachi.
* He also worked with his uncle to prepare Majid Khan and others for travel to the United States to conduct terrorist operations.
* Baluchi reportedly sent Majid Khan to Thailand in late 2002 to deliver $50,000 to finance a plan by Jemaah Islamiya leader Hambali (Riduan Isamuddin) to attack US and Israeli targets in Southeast Asia.

He later told investigators he helped his uncle arrange travel visas for people, but didn&#x27;t know whether any of them were militants or not. In August 2002, the FBI questioned Abdul Samad Din Mohammed, the brother-in-law of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He reported that al-Baluchi was often in the company of his uncle, and would pick people up from the airport. His uncle KSM was arrested in Rawalpindi on 1 March 2003. al-Baluchi spent the next two months with Walid bin &#x27;Attash. According to US reports, following his uncle&#x27;s arrest al-Baluchi took charge of some of the new attacks being planned. 

==== Marriage to Aafia Siddiqui ====
al-Baluchi also married Aafia Siddiqui. She was accused of being an al-Qaeda member and in February 2010 was convicted of assaulting with a deadly weapon and attempting to kill U.S. soldiers and FBI agents who were seeking to interrogate her while she was in custody, claimed to be married to al-Baluchi. The marriage was confirmed by Pakistani and US intelligence, a defense psychologist, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s family, while Siddiqui&#x27;s own family denies she was married to al-Baluchi.

According to the FBI, after her arrest, Aafia Siddiqui told them that after she learned she was wanted by the US government she had gone into hiding around late March 2003 with the al-Baluchi clan. Divorced at the time, she stated she married al-Baluchi out of religious piety, since she &quot;could not live in the same house with an unmarried male&quot; (namely al-Baluchi). Their marriage was held in Hub Chowki outside of Karachi in the inner courtyard of al-Baluchi&#x27;s house, with female al-Baluchi family members present. Siddiqui describes al-Baluchi as very kind to her, &quot;a good man who is wrongly accused&quot;; however, Siddiqui later repudiated all statements given by her to the FBI.

The marriage lasted only a couple of months. According to one of KSM&#x27;s uncles, Mohammed Hussein, al-Baluchi felt alienated by Aafia&#x27;s &quot;liberal way of life&quot;. Aafia told the FBI that al-Baluchi divorced her after he was arrested.

==Arrest by U.S. authorities in Pakistan==

Siddiqui was arrested 29 April 2003 in Karachi along with al-Attash. al-Baluchi had a copy of a letter to Osama bin Laden from Saudi scholars in his pocket, a computer disk containing a draft of a letter to bin Laden, two images of the September 11 attacks, and a perfume bottle containing low-concentration cyanide used to bleach and perfume clothes. al-Baluchi was also accused of discussing the possibility of exporting explosives to the United States through textile companies, but claims to have no knowledge of what conversation is being referenced. The arrests led to the arrests of Jawad al-Bashar and Farzand Shah. On 7 November 2003, a detainee was interrogated and said that Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh spoke briefly in August 2000 about a &quot;Losh&quot; who had asked Atta if he could travel to the United States to help with any potential plots, having already asked Mohammed three months earlier. Authorities allege this is a reference to al-Baluchi.

=== Custody at CIA black sites in Afghanistan ===
Baluchi was extensively tortured by the CIA after his arrest, while being held at a CIA black site north of Kabul, Afghanistan. The extent of his torture was detailed in a 2008 report by the CIA&#x27;s inspector general, declassified in March 2022. According to the inspector general, al-Baluchi was held there &quot;extra-legally&quot; as he was a Pakistani citizen who no longer presented a terrorist threat, and it was not clear to him whether al-Baluchi&#x27;s torture was even intended to elicit information; the inspector general concluded that al-Baluchi&#x27;s torture ultimately yielded no useful intelligence.

While in CIA custody, al-Baluchi served as a &quot;training prop&quot; to teach torture techniques to trainee CIA interrogators. One torture technique, known as &quot;walling&quot;, was often practiced on al-Baluchi. In it, trainees would line up and take turns &quot;shoving&quot; a naked and tied-up al-Baluchi head-first into a plywood wall behind him, with sessions typically lasting for a few hours each. One of the instructors identified the goal being to &quot;bounce&quot; al-Baluchi&#x27;s head off the wall. Analysis carried out by a neuropsychologist in 2018 found &quot;abnormalities indicating moderate to severe brain damage&quot; consistent with traumatic brain injury in al-Baluchi&#x27;s brain. In addition, the inspector general said that interrogators in the black site also carried out torture that went beyond the CIA&#x27;s guidelines, including dousing him with ice water and forcing him to kneel backwards with a stick behind his knees in a stress position. In a senate report from 2014, officials noted: &quot;al-Baluchi was tortured and forcibly dunked into a tub filled with ice water. CIA interrogators forcibly kept his head under water while he struggled to breathe and beat him repeatedly with a truncheon-like object hitting him and smashing his head against a wall.&quot;

==== Discovery of other plots to attack civilian targets ====
According to US investigators, al-Baluchi told them that al-Qaeda had set up a biological weapons lab and he asked Aafia Siddiqui (who has a biology degree from MIT) advice on how long it would take to develop such weapons and whether the man in charge was capable of developing the weapons. Siddiqui replied that she &quot;was willing to participate in a biological weapons (BW) project if al-Qaida tasked her to do so&quot;.

Another plot involving al-Baluchi alleged by US investigators involved Heathrow airport. According to al-Baluchi&#x27;s file, he told interrogators that he became aware of a plan to attack Heathrow airport in January 2003 and had intended to seek help from a more senior al-Qaida operative, Walid bin Attash, to carry it out.

An &quot;analyst note&quot; in the files notes that the plot called for &quot;crashing numerous airplanes into Heathrow, with a secondary explosion immediately outside of the airport as a diversion&quot;. It collapsed after KSM was arrested in March 2003.

== Transfer to the U.S. Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba ==
In December 2005, Human Rights Watch listed al-Baluchi as a &quot;ghost detainee&quot; held in the CIA prison system. al-Baluchi was kept in CIA custody until 6 September 2006, when he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba.
On 6 September 2006, al-Baluchi was transferred from a black site location to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He was given the Internment Serial Number 10018 and is currently detained at a top-secret site at the Guantanamo base that allegedly houses approximately 15 &quot;high-value&quot; prisoners. Its location and the conditions inside are withheld from public knowledge and there are suspected grave human rights concerns regarding its conditions. Al-Baluchi&#x27;s attorney James G. Connell III visited him there in August 2013 under an order issued by the military commission.

, al-Baluchi was stuck in a state of legal limbo, yet to face trial. No journalist has been able to talk to him since his detention, due to strict restrictions imposed by the US government. Declassified CIA documents revealed that the CIA had been using al-Baluchi as a human experiment for interrogators learning torture techniques. He was subjected to water dousing, cramped confinement, sleep deprivation, put in stress positions and walling. Medical professionals examining al-Baluchi reported serious consequences like brain damage, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of torture.

=== Combatant Status Review Tribunal (2007) ===
US District Court Justice Joyce Hens Green ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Department of Defense scheduled Tribunals for the 14 high-value captives who were transferred from covert CIA custody, on 6 September 2006, for early winter of 2007.

The Summary of Evidence memo for al-Baluchi&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal was drafted on 8 February 2007.

Al-Baluchi cooperated with his tribunal. Although he was not able to call Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Saifullah Paracha or Ramzi bin al-Shibh to testify about his lack of connection to al-Qaeda, he was permitted to have his legal representative field statements they had made. He chose to put forward the statements by Mohammed and bin al-Shibh as evidence, but not the statement by Paracha.

Baluchi requested statements be garnered from &quot;Modern Electronics Corporation&quot; personnel, including Samir Sharin, Mohammed Mayer, Asraf Mayer, Ammar al-Tesqui and Sayed Tesqui that would testify he had no connections to militant forces, and that his employee records would show that he left several days before the attacks because his work permit had expired when MEC closed its Dubai branch. The tribunal judge ruled that although al-Baluchi&#x27;s leaving Dubai a few days prior to the attacks was among the reasons for his capture, it was not relevant to seek records from his employer. Since the tribunal did not locate the individuals, al-Baluchi submitted two statements he had written himself as what he believed his coworkers would say, and what he believed his Israeli roommates would say.

In his defence, al-Baluchi argued that he often acted as a &quot;businessman&quot; to supplement his income, and thus his signature, telephone number and similar details were easily obtained in Dubai. He admitted dealing with Marwan al-Shehhi, but said that &quot;when [he] approached me, he never declared himself as &#x27;hijacker Marwan al Shehhi&#x27;. He approached me the same way he approached other individuals and companies in the U.S.: a man wanting to do business&quot;.

The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

=== First military commission (2008) ===
In February 2008, al-Baluchi was committed to a joint trial, charged with conspiracy, attacking civilians and civilian objects, causing serious bodily injury, murder, destruction of property, hijacking, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism.

al-Baluchi, Walid Bin Attash, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed chose to serve as their own attorney.
They requested laptops, and internet access, in order to prepare their defences. In October 2008, Ralph Kohlmann ruled that the men be provided with the computers, but not the internet access.
al-Baluchi&#x27;s request said he was a Microsoft Certified software engineer.

On 8 December 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after mental competency hearings for Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh. Mohammed said, &quot;We want everyone to plead together.&quot;

=== Executive Order 13492 of Barack Obama (2009) ===
On 22 January 2009, United States President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13492, ordering a halt to the Guantanamo military commission as part of the overall closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. On 21 April 2009, United States Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell cited &quot;Ali Abd al-Azeez Ali&quot; as an example of the kind of captive United States President Barack Obama might free in the United States when he closes the camp in January 2010, because he didn&#x27;t know what else to do with him.

=== Second military commission (2011) ===
In October 2011, in an operation called the &quot;baseline review,&quot; the prison seized all legal materials belonging to &quot;high-value detainees,&quot; starting with Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The prison also announced that it would change its previous policy and begin reviewing legal mail for its content. In response, the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) ordered the attorneys under his supervision to stop sending privileged communications to Guantanamo prisoners. Under the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) policy, Al-Baluchi could not receive mail from his attorneys until November 2013.

On 4 April 2012, the Department of Defense referred Guantanamo military commission charges against al-Baluchi and four other men for participation in the conspiracy leading up to the September 11 attacks. On 5 May 2012, Military Judge James Pohl arraigned al al-Baluchi, and appointed attorneys to represent him.

=== Preliminary hearing on admissibility of clean team evidence (2019) ===
During a preliminary hearing, held on 17 September 2019, the prosecution released a transcript from a conversation al-Baluchi had with another captive, when they were in two nearby recreation yards. It had not been known, until the release of this transcript, that the recreation yards contained hidden listening devices. According to an article by Carol Rosenberg, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Camp Seven had at least two recreation yards. Captives got a whole recreation yard to themselves, during their outdoor recreation time. But they could hear other captives in nearby yards, and could communicate with them, by yelling.

Prosecutors claimed the transcript&#x27;s discussion of a confession al-Baluchi was considering, drafted for him by fellow captive Ramzi bin al-Shibh, was evidence of al-Baluchi&#x27;s guilt. His defense attorneys argued that his willingness to consider a confession was an aftereffect of his years of torture.

The purpose of the hearing was to help a new judge, W. Shane Cohen, make a decision as to whether confessions given to the &quot;clean team&quot; were still compromised by al-Baluchi&#x27;s torture.

==In popular culture==

=== &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; (2012) ===
A fictionalized account of al-Baluchi&#x27;s interrogation at black sites is depicted in the 2012 film &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;. The character Ammar is portrayed by Reda Kateb. Al-Baluchi has complained that the United States has provided more information to the filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal about al-Baluchi&#x27;s treatment in CIA custody than it has to al-Baluchi&#x27;s own attorneys.

==== CIA acknowledgement ====
The CIA acknowledged that the character Ammar is based on al-Baluchi. In the film, CIA interrogator Dan Fuller and other characters repeatedly describe Ammar as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s nephew. Fuller also references the arrest of Ammar and describes his role as the financial facilitator in the 9/11 attacks. &quot;The first 25 minutes of the movie are largely taken up with torture: Ammar is strung up, beaten, water boarded and kept awake for 96 hours straight.&quot;

<text>The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (ALKQN, ALKN, or LKN, also known as simply Latin Kings) is a gang active primarily in the United States as well as internationally. The gang was founded by Puerto Ricans in Chicago, Illinois, in 1954. The Latin Kings are one of the largest Hispanic and Latino street and prison gangs worldwide.

In the United States, the Latin Kings operate under two umbrella factions—the King Motherland Chicago (KMC) faction headquartered in Chicago, and the Bloodline faction based in New York. The KMC faction consists of 60 structured chapters operating in 158 cities in 31 U.S. states, with a membership of between 20,000 and 35,000. The Bloodline Latin Kings have a membership of 2,200 to 7,500, and operate several dozen chapters in 15 cities in 5 states. The gang also has a significant presence in the prison system. The Latin Kings are involved in a wide variety of criminal activities, including drug dealing, assault, burglary, homicide, identity theft, and money laundering, with the gang&#x27;s primary source of income deriving from the street-level distribution of narcotics.

==History==
===King Motherland Chicago faction===
The Latin Kings were founded in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago in 1954 by Ramon Santos as the Imperials, a Puerto Rican progress movement with the goal of overcoming racial discrimination. With the Latino community facing constant violence from Greek and Italian greaser gangs, the Imperials merged with various other Puerto Rican and Mexican street gangs to form the Latin Kings, key developments in the history of gangs in Humboldt Park. With its original focus being on fighting back against discrimination, the gang would later, however, devolve into a criminal enterprise operating throughout the United States. There are two umbrella factions: the King Motherland Chicago (KMC) – also known as King Manifesto and Constitution – and Bloodline, formed in New York City in 1986. All members of the gang identify themselves as Latin Kings.

Latin Kings associating with the Motherland faction also identify themselves as &quot;Almighty Latin King Nation&quot; (ALKN); they make up more than 160 structured chapters operating in 158 cities in 31 states. The membership in Chicago is estimated to be 20,000 to 35,000.

The Chicago faction of the Latin Kings is recognized as one of the largest Hispanic street gangs in the United States after the Sureños and Norteños, as well as MS-13 and the 18th Street gang, and one of the largest street gangs based in Chicago. Their greatest membership is within the United States; in the city of Chicago alone, the gang has more than 25,000 members. The Latin Kings have also organized chapters in numerous states and several Latin American and European countries.

===Bloodline faction===
The Bloodline Manifesto was founded by Luis &quot;King Blood&quot; Felipe in 1986 in the New York State Collins Correctional Facility. Latin Kings associating with New York State Bloodline chapter also identify themselves as the &quot;Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation&quot; (ALKQN). Membership is estimated to be as large as 7,500, divided among several dozen tribes operating in 15 cities across five states. New York State Bloodline Latin Kings share a common culture and structure with KMC and respect them as the Motherland, but not all chapters report to the Chicago leadership hierarchy.

In the early 1980s, to avoid imprisonment for his criminal activities in Chicago, Luis Felipe (a.k.a. King Blood) fled to New York. Soon after arriving in New York, he was arrested and convicted of murdering his girlfriend. In 1986, while in prison, Felipe started his own chapter of the Latin Kings known as the Bloodline. He designated himself as Inca and Supreme Crown of the state of New York. From 1986 to 1994, the ALKQN solidified its status as a gang through crimes such as murder, racketeering, and other offenses covered under the RICO Act. In 1991, Felipe was returned to prison after a short release for parole violations stemming from the receipt of stolen goods. However, he continued to guide the ALKQN members, who now numbered about 2,000, both incarcerated and free.

In 1994, with the rapid growth of the Latin Kings, an internal power struggle erupted, and violence within the Kings ensued. Between June 1993 and February 1994, seven Latin Kings were murdered. Following the outbreak of internal gang violence, Felipe and 19 others were charged with murder and racketeering; the indictment process ended in 1995 with 39 Latin Kings and 1 Latin Queen indicted under the RICO Act. Felipe was charged with ordering the killing of William (Lil Man) Cartagena, who had been taken to an abandoned Bronx apartment and strangled, decapitated, mutilated and set on fire. Although Felipe was in prison, the government later alleged he had ordered a T.O.S. (&quot;Terminate On Sight&quot;) to all Latin Kings for the murder of Cartagena. This letter and many others were how Felipe was initially linked to three murders on the streets of New York; testimony from former Kings was used as further evidence of the orders. The letters had been copied and stored by the NY Department of Corrections, who were not aware of the significance of the letters until a federal task force was formed that included NYPD homicide investigators, FBI agents, and DOC investigators.

Following the 1996 trial and conviction of Felipe, Antonio Fernandez, who was blessed as the Inca and Supreme Crown of New York State, knelt with other Latin Kings in front of the Federal District Court in Manhattan and was quoted as stating, &quot;It&#x27;s time for a fresh start ... Now they can&#x27;t hold our past against us.&quot; From then on, the ALKQN once again began a transformation. Latin Kings and Queens began appearing en masse at political demonstrations in support of the Latino community. To further its efforts to legitimize, the organization began to hold monthly meetings (universals) at St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in West Harlem. At this time, the membership of the Latin Kings is believed to have swelled to 3,000 incarcerated and 4,000 free. The monthly universals drew attendance of 500–600 regularly. Internal changes to the organization began to take place as Fernandez amended the ALKQN manifesto to include parliamentary elections and new procedures for handling inter-organizational grievances and remove death as a possible punishment, replacing it with &quot;vanishing&quot;, the act of being banished from the movement.

For the ALKQN, 1997 began with Felipe being sentenced to 250 years in prison, with the first 45 to be spent in solitary confinement. The other 39 members were sentenced to an average of 20 years in prison for their roles in the crimes. The year would bring further legal troubles as Fernandez and 31 others were arrested in a raid in the Lower East Side and charged with disorderly conduct. The Special Commissioner of Investigation for Schools soon charged the ALKQN with infiltrating the school system; a school security guard with five years of service was dismissed on charges of unprofessional conduct for his association with the Latin Kings. The year came to a close with Fernandez being arrested in December by the FBI for domestic abuse. The pending charges against Fernandez were dropped in early 1998. Following the release of Fernandez, a joint operation of the FBI, New York City Police Department (NYPD), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), New York State Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) came to a close with the arrests of 92 suspected ALKQN members, half of whom the Latin Kings leadership insisted were not members. The operation, dubbed Operation Crown, cost the city over one million dollars and took 19 months to complete. Fernandez was released after four days on $350,000 bail, which was paid for by the mandatory dues that the Bloodline treasurer had collected from the community every week. Over half of the arrested were charged with misdemeanors; other were charged with weapons possession and drug trafficking. Fernandez was eventually permitted, though under house arrest, to attend monthly universal meetings. It was during his time under house arrest that the Latin Queens underwent a shake up in leadership, dismissing many of the leaders in order to bring in more politically focused members.

During this period, the Latin Kings began to gain some legitimacy within the Puerto Rican Nationalist movement, starting from when Lolita Lebrón, a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, who served 25 years in federal prison for her participation in an attack on the U.S. Capitol alongside other Puerto Rican militants in 1954, enlisted the New York State ALKQN to protect her during a demonstration in front of the United Nations headquarters. Following the U.N. demonstration, Rafael Cancel-Miranda, another Puerto Rican nacionalista who spent 25 years in federal prison for the same crimes as Lebrón, attended a monthly universal. Before the year&#x27;s end, Adelfa Vera, also a Puerto Rican activist, attended a monthly universal and was given ALKQN beads by the present leadership. Vera was praised during the meeting and stated &quot;These kids are hope for our liberation struggle. I can die in peace, because we found the continuation.&quot; In 1998, Fernandez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell and distribute heroin. In 1999, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which he began serving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Kansas, and was placed in solitary confinement. He was eventually transferred again and placed in general population, and has since been released.

==Organizational structure==
The Latin Kings have a hierarchical organizational structure. They have numerous &quot;chapters&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; around the country which adhere to a regional, state, and national system. Officers are supported by a &quot;Crown Council&quot; of the 5 Crowns Council members. The Council sets rules and regulations and holds disciplinary hearings.

The hierarchy rises to regional officers and ultimately to two supreme regional &quot;Incas&quot; based in Chicago. The heads of the entire criminal organization are known as &quot;coronas&quot;. One retired detective said in 2004: &quot;When you compare them to other street gangs like the Bloods and the Crips, none compare to the organization of the Latin Kings.&quot;

===Markings===

The Latin King colors are black and gold. Gang markings consist of a five- or three-point &quot;sacred crown&quot;, writings of LK, ALK, ALKN, ALKQN abbreviations (or the whole words), and drawings of the Lion or the King Master. Latin King symbolism is usually accompanied with the name and number of the Tribe, region, or city of the gang. The Latin Kings are members of the People Nation alliance of gangs, and are therefore opposed to the rival Folk Nation gang alliance.

===Discipline===
When any member believes that another member has violated a regulation, they begin the disciplinary process by submitting a Procedures for Violation Form. This form includes a variety of information about the allegation, including the violation, the statement of the accused, and members present or other witnesses. If the member is found to be guilty of the violation at their Crown hearing, they may be subject to a range of penalties depending on the severity of the offense:

&quot;Non-corporal punishments&quot;
* Probation – for a period ranging between two weeks and two months, can be imposed in addition to other punishments
* Fines (Multas) – may also be used as a way to recoup the expense of gang property when it is destroyed or lost by a member
* Stripping – the member is stripped of rank and titles, unlikely to ever rise to the previous rank again
* Suspension – the member is stripped of all offices and duties, is not permitted to wear the colors, and is addressed as a novice
* Community service – particular assignments made on a case-by-case basis

&quot;Corporal punishments&quot;
* B.O.S. (Beat on sight) – beating of undetermined length of time
* Three minute physical – three-minute beating by at least three members
* Five minute physical – five-minute beating by five members
* T.O.S. (Terminate on sight) – death

==&quot;Kingism&quot; ideology==

L. A. Kaufman wrote in the February 2015 issue of &quot;New York&quot; magazine that the Kings had a &quot;unique mixture of intense discipline, revolutionary politics and a homemade religion called &#x27;Kingism. He suggests that this makes &quot;a potent mixture for troubled ghetto kids whose lives lacked structure and hope.&quot; Kingism is a blend of tribal gang rhetoric and religious mysticism. As one member put it, the Manifesto is &quot;considered our Bible&quot;, and reading it is to go &quot;from the darkness to the light&quot;.

The Latin Kings operate under strict codes and guidelines that are conveyed in a lengthy constitution, and they follow the teachings of the King Manifesto. According to the Manifesto, there are three stages or cycles of Nation life that constitute Kingism:

# The Primitive Stage: &quot;That stage in life where the King warrior acts on impulse, executing his action without giving them the serious thought that they demand. A stage of immaturity where the King warrior&#x27;s time is spent gang banging, getting high, and being recognized as big and bad.&quot;
# The Conservative Stage: &quot;At this level the King warrior becomes tired of the primitive stage. He no longer wishes to participate in the senseless routine of gang fighting, hanging on the corner or being recognized as big and bad. Most often at this level the King warrior gets married and retires. It is inappropriate to call this stage maturity stage due to the fact that the King warrior at this time does not really become mature in the sense of maturity. Instead he becomes mummified or reaches a level of accepting life as it has been taught to him by the existing system that exploits all people of color-dehumanizes them and maintains them under the economic and social yoke of slavery.&quot;
# The New King Stage: &quot;The stage of awareness and decision. The new King recognizes that the time for revolution is at hand. Revolution of the mind! The revolution of knowledge! A revolution that will bring freedom to the enslaved, to all Third World people as we together sing and praise with joy what time it is-it is Nation time! ... For him there are no horizons between races, sexes and senseless labels. for him everything has meaning, human life is placed above materialistic values ... When a man become a new King the will of the Nation becomes his will, for to be at variance with the Nation is one thing that cannot endure. The Almighty Latin King Nation requires wholehearted and complete devotion.&quot;

According to the Manifesto, &quot;The New King no longer views the rival warrior as the cause of his ills; instead, he fights against the Anti-King System (social injustices and inequality)&quot;.

==Latin Queens==
While originally the Latin Kings are thought to be a male organization, it eventually began to absorb women and give them an equal share. The Latin Queens constituted the female Queen Anubis and Queen Maat of the ALKQN.

The Latin Queen agenda is composed of self-respect, independence, family support, ethnic identity and self-empowerment. Seeking such goals has attracted a wide variety of females who had been drug-addicted, victimized and/or neglected by families, spouses and partners. Sociologists studying the Latin Kings and Queens have observed the different methods in which both groups attempt to &quot;reclaim and regulate&quot; their environments. The Latin Queens are believed to focus more on their private space issues such as home life and protection and nurturing of their bodies, as opposed to the Latin Kings, who are more concerned with loss of public spaces in their own communities.

The evolution of the ALKQN has been viewed by outside sources as being assisted by the addition and greater role in which Queen Loki and Queen Vailor have played, exposing the ALKQN to a greater range of cross-class supporters than would have been possible prior to their integration. In countries such as Spain, Latin Queens are helping to legitimize the ALKQN through integration with government-sponsored programs. In Catalonia, the 200 persons including Queen Tragedy and King Zeus and the rest of the Latin Kings and Queens tribe was designated as the Cultural Association of Latin Kings and Queens of Catalonia. The &quot;cultural program&quot; designation was bestowed through government-sponsored programs to assist gangs with integration into society and is led by Latin Queen Melody, Erika Jaramillo.

==Investigations and prosecutions==
The primary source of income of the Latin Kings is the street-level distribution of powder cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. The gang is also involved in burglary, identity theft, money laundering, assault, and homicide. The Latin Kings maintain links with Mexican drug cartels, and have served as the suppliers of narcotics to motorcycle gangs such as the Pagan&#x27;s and the Diablos. The Latin Kings have also collaborated in various crimes, including contract killings, with American Mafia crime families.

As a faction of the People Nation gang alliance, the Latin Kings are affiliated with other gangs under the People umbrella, such as the Vice Lords. The Latin Kings&#x27; primary rivals include the Gangster Disciples and various Hispanic and Latino gangs in the Folk Nation alliance.

===Canada===
Four people were injured after Latin Kings members attacked a former member at a subway station in Toronto on 22 June 2007. A thirteen-year-old who was left partially paralyzed as a result of being stabbed.

Nine members of the Latin Kings in Toronto were arrested in October 2009 under the Immigration Act and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act after a two-year police sting known as Project Royal Flush. Four Latin Kings members, including Ecuadoran citizen Flavio Mauricio Reyes-Criollo who founded the Canadian branch of the gang in 2003, were ordered deported from Canada in July 2010.

===Spain===
The Latin Kings in Spain were founded in Madrid in February 2002 by Ecuadorian national Eric Javier Vara Velastegui. Branches then followed in Barcelona, Valencia and Murcia. Membership is predominantly Ecuadorian, although other Latin American and Spanish youths have also been recruited. According to a report by the Madrid government commission, there are approximately one-hundred active members and six-hundred associates in the city. In Spain, the Ñetas are the main rivals of the Latin Kings. Such Latin American gangs spread to Spain as a result of mass deportations from the United States of Latin American immigrants with criminal records. The Latin Kings were registered as a cultural association in Catalonia in September 2006.

Eric Javier Vara Velastegui received a forty-year prison sentence for rape, violent assault and kidnapping in June 2006. In February 2011, Velastegui had an additional four years added to his sentence after being convicted of directing the gang from prison, while lieutenants Jose Fabricio Icaza and Maria Torres were sentenced to three-and-a-half years&#x27; and two years&#x27; imprisonment, respectively.

The inner circle of the Latin Kings in Madrid was dismantled when fifty-four members were arrested during a police operation carried out in February 2010. A substantial amount of documentation relating to the gang and its organization, as well as gang paraphernalia such as necklaces to denote rank within the gang, black and gold flags, neckscarves and rings, was also confiscated.

Five key members were ordered deported from Madrid in February 2015.

Twenty-three members were arrested in the Barcelona metropolitan area by &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot; on 10 June 2015, suspected of organized crime membership, drug trafficking, assault and extortion.

=== United States ===

==== Connecticut ====
The Latin Kings in Connecticut started in the state&#x27;s prison system in the late 1980s. The gang has over two hundred members in the state.

Sixteen Latin Kings members, included the four highest-ranking members in the state, were arrested in Bridgeport and New Haven on June 30, 1994, and charged with conspiring to sell cocaine and heroin. Nelson Luis Millet, president and highest-ranking officer in the Connecticut Latin Kings, was sentenced to life in prison in January 1996.

An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Northern Connecticut Violent Crimes Gang Task Force and Hartford Police Department Vice and Narcotics Division into narcotics trafficking and associated violence in Hartford&#x27;s South End by the Latin Kings resulted in two gang members being convicted for drug trafficking. Hector &quot;Bebo&quot; Salazar was sentenced to five years and nine months&#x27; imprisonment for distributing heroin, fentanyl and crack cocaine on November 18, 2019, and Brian &quot;Buddha&quot; Matos was sentenced to four years and nine months&#x27; for trafficking cocaine and fentanyl on February 5, 2020.

==== Delaware ====
The Latin Kings are one of the few organized street gangs operating in the state of Delaware. Latin Kings member Alejandro Rodriguez-Ortiz was charged with the July 2, 2008 murder of Angel Rivera – a fellow Latin King who was shot dead in Wilmington – as well as the murder of rival gang member Rodrigo Monroy, who was fatally shot on September 30, 2008.

==== Florida ====
On August 20, 2006, thirty-nine leading Latin Kings members – every known leader of the gang in Florida – were arrested after law enforcement officers raided a high-level meeting at a rented club in Tampa. The raid followed a fourteen-month investigation and resulted in the gang members being charged with conspiracy to commit racketeering.

Twenty-three Latin Kings members were indicted in south Florida in May 2015 on charges including racketeering conspiracy, drug trafficking and illegal weapons possession. By January 2016, all twenty-three members of the gang – which operated in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties – had pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges.

==== Illinois ====
On September 18, 1997, fourteen Latin Kings members and associates were charged with running a drug operation that distributed $6 million worth of crack and powder cocaine, marijuana and heroin throughout Chicago. Latin Kings North Side faction leader Gustavo &quot;Gino&quot; Colon was sentenced to life in prison as a result of the case.

Augustin Zambrano – a ranking &quot;Corona&quot; within the Latin Kings, making him the highest-ranking member outside of prison and responsible for overseeing the activities of factions of the gang – was among eighteen leading Latin Kings members charged with racketeering conspiracy as part of a federal indictment against the gang&#x27;s hierarchy. Zambrano was convicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) of racketeering conspiracy and related charges involving narcotics trafficking and violence. He was sentenced to sixty years in prison on January 11, 2012. The gang&#x27;s second-in-command, Vicente &quot;Disciple Killer&quot; (DK) Garcia, was sentenced to forty years in prison on related charges on February 11, 2013.

Twenty-one Latin Kings were imprisoned for up to thirty years for a racketeering conspiracy involving two murders; the December 2003 murder of Jonathan Zimmerman in Hammond and the May 2008 murder of Jose Cortez in East Chicago. The last of the gang members was sentenced on November 27, 2018.

Latin Kings member Darrick Vallodolid was convicted in May 2018 of conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana. To support the conspiracy, Vallodolid murdered Victor Lusinski in Hammond on April 12, 2009. Lusinski was killed because Vallodolid thought he was a rival gang member. Vallodolid was sentenced to life in prison on November 25, 2019.

==== Maryland ====
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) began investigating the Latin Kings&#x27; Maryland-based Royal Lion Tribe following the firebombing of a house in Rockville on January 8, 2008. After building a RICO case against the gang, the ATF and local police arrested eighteen members during a series of coordinated raids on November 19, 2009. One other was apprehended a month later after fleeing to New York. By March 2011, all nineteen defendants had either pleaded guilty or been convicted for the roles in a racketeering conspiracy.

==== Massachusetts ====
Operation Dethrone was an investigation by the Western Massachusetts Gang Task Force, consisting of the FBI, the Chicopee Police Department, the Hampden County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, the Holyoke Police Department, the Massachusetts State Police, the Springfield Police Department, and the West Springfield Police Department. The first phase of the investigation, went after the Lawrence chapter of the ALKQN, was converted to an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force/High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area case involving numerous federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. After the significant disruption of the Lawrence chapter in February 2004, information provided by cooperating defendants led to the significant disruption of the Springfield chapter in June 2005. 57 ALKQN members have been indicted.

On December 6, 2019, more than 45 alleged Latin King members, including its leader Michael Cecchetelli, were arrested by the FBI and other state and local agencies, in Massachusetts. Among those arrested was Shaun &quot;Rev&quot; Harrison, an academic dean in the Boston Public Schools district who lived a double life as a Latin Kings gangster. Harrison attempted to murder a student that he had recruited into the gang and who was selling marijuana at the English High School in Boston at the Harrison&#x27;s direction.

==== Michigan ====
A multi-year joint federal and state investigation of the Holland Latin Kings (HLK) resulted in the prosecution of thirty-one of the gang&#x27;s members. The investigation – which involved the ATF, Michigan State Police (MSP) the Holland Police Department – became public on July 19, 2012, when over a hundred state and federal officers simultaneously executed search warrants at over fifteen residences and a business in Holland, which were all linked to the HLK. Of the thirty-one gang members charged, twenty-nine pleaded guilty to racketeering offenses.

==== Minnesota ====
A year-long investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Saint Paul Police Department (SPPD) known as Operation Wild Kingdom culminated in the arrests of twenty-six Latin Kings members and associates on federal narcotics and firearms trafficking charges during a series of arrests carried out across the Twin Cities area on March 7, 2006.

==== New Jersey ====
Forty-seven Latin Kings members, including eleven holding senior leadership positions, were charged between October 2002 and May 2003 in connection with a New Jersey State Police (NJSP) investigation dubbed Operation Catapult. The investigation successfully tracked and documented Latin King activity in five counties, and resulted in charges related to the planned attempted murder of a rival gang member, the sale of heroin, crack cocaine and marijuana, the theft and resale of stolen automobiles and other stolen property, and the possession, use and sale of prohibited assault weapons.

Four leaders of the Latin Kings in Newark were among fifteen people indicted on racketeering charges on July 13, 2017, as part of Operation Peddling Misery, an investigation by the NJSP and Division of Criminal Justice that targeted a drug distribution enterprise that was dealing large quantities of heroin and crack cocaine in the city. Japhet &quot;King Japhet&quot; Lopez, Kiele &quot;King Forty&quot; Lopez and Carlos &quot;King Future&quot; Rodriguez pleaded guilty to racketeering. On June 29, 2018, Japhet Lopez was sentenced to fifteen years&#x27; imprisonment, Kiele Lopez was sentenced to seven years&#x27;, and Rodriguez was sentenced to eight years&#x27;.

==== New York ====
The Latin Kings in New York source heroin and cocaine from Dominican criminal groups which they distribute at retail quantities.

Twenty members and associates of the Latin Kings were charged on June 21, 1994, with various crimes including the murders of at least seven of their own members. The arrests resulted from a four-month investigation by the FBI and the New York Police Department (NYPD).

Carlos Gil, &quot;Warlord&quot; or enforcer, of a Latin Kings chapter in Sunset Park, Brooklyn was convicted on May 11, 2007, for the murder of Jorge Rodriguez, a member of a Flatbush, Brooklyn-based Latin Kings chapter who was shot and killed on October 14, 2001, for associating with another gang in violation of the Latin Kings&#x27; rules. Gil was sentenced to life in prison.

In 2014, two Latin Kings members, Jose &quot;Tank&quot; Escalera and Giovanni &quot;Monte&quot; Cotto, ordered the assault of a witness who was providing testimony for the government in the federal murder trial of another Latin King. The witness suffered multiple contusions and a broken jaw when he was attacked in the recreation yard of the Cattaraugus County jail. On July 14, 2017, Escalera and Cotto were convicted of retaliating against a witness.

In December 2019, 17 members and associates of the Black Mob, the largest Latin Kings &quot;tribe&quot; in the New York area, were charged with racketeering offenses, narcotics conspiracy, and firearms offenses involving the distribution of heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine. Seven additional members and associates were charged in the case in April 2021. Diego &quot;Casa&quot; Mateo, who founded the Black Mob in 2002, pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute narcotics on February 23, 2022, and was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison on June 1, 2023.

==== North Carolina ====
In December 2011, thirteen Latin Kings members were indicted by a federal grand jury in Greensboro for conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise.

==== Ohio ====
A dozen Latin Kings members were among thirty-four people indicted on drug charges following a year-long investigation – called Operation Royal Flush – by the FBI, Cleveland Division of Police (CDP) and Cuyahoga County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. A series of raids coinciding with the indictments led to the arrests of twenty-nine people in Cleveland on August 13, 2009.

==== Pennsylvania ====
An eighteen-month investigation in York County, known as Operation Sunrise, resulted in the arrests of more than eighty people, including members of the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings, and the seizure of heroin and cocaine with a street value of more than $300,000, 43 vehicles, seven guns, and more than $34,000 cash in February 2013. Fifteen Latin Kings leaders were imprisoned as a result.

Twenty three people, including three members of the Latin Kings, were indicted in March 2019 as part of an investigation into a drug ring in Berks County. In addition to narcotics offenses, the trio were also charged with conspiring to shoot a rival.

==== Rhode Island ====
An investigation by the FBI into gang activity in Rhode Island found that the Providence chapter of the Latin Kings, made up of approximately 100 members, has been active in narcotics trafficking, gunrunning, extortion and murder since at least September 1994.

Eric &quot;King E&quot; Thomas, leader of the Rhode Island chapter of the Latin Kings, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine in December 2019. On August 11, 2020, Thomas pleaded guilty to the charges, admitting that in August 2019, he conspired with others to purchase cocaine from members of the Latin Kings in New Bedford, Massachusetts for resale. Days later, on September 4, 2019, a co-conspirator was captured in a video recording purchasing 186 grams of cocaine from members of the New Bedford chapter in a deal facilitated by Thomas.

==== Vermont ====
In January 2016, Latin Kings member Juan &quot;Chino&quot; Rodriguez was sentenced to serve four-to-fifteen years in prison after being convicted of carrying out a drive-by shooting that injured a man in St. Johnsbury on July 15, 2014.

John Guerrero, a member of the Latin Kings&#x27; Boston, Massachusetts chapter, was sentenced to thirteen years&#x27; imprisonment on February 14, 2020, after pleading guilty to the distributing at least 2.8 kilograms of crack cocaine in the Franklin County area and for trafficking at least thirty illegally purchased firearms from Vermont to the Boston area.

==== Wisconsin ====
Thirty-three members of the Latin Kings in Milwaukee were charged in a RICO indictment on June 19, 1998. According to the indictment, the gang members were responsible for nine murders, twenty-one attempted murders, nine robberies, three arsons or attempted arsons, five kidnappings and drug dealing over an eleven-year period. Gang-related violence escalated on Milwaukee&#x27;s South Side after the indictments as a perceived lack of leadership in the Latin Kings prompted rival gangs to attempt takeovers.

Another police crackdown on the Milwaukee faction resulted in forty nine Latin Kings members being indicted on October 12, 2005, on federal racketeering charges for crimes that include four murders, 38 attempted murders and widespread drug trafficking.

Latin Kings member Timothy Vallejo was sentenced to life in prison on January 26, 2010, after being convicted of racketeering and the murder of Oak Creek resident Kevin Hirschfield outside a Cudahy gas station in 2003.

<doc id="988463" wikidata="Q845154" url="?curid=988463" title="West Quoddy Head Light">
<text>West Quoddy Head, in Quoddy Head State Park, Lubec, Maine, is the easternmost point of the contiguous United States. In 1808 a lighthouse was constructed at the site to guide ships through the Quoddy Narrows. The current tower, with distinctive red-and-white stripes, was constructed in 1858 and is an active aid to navigation. The 3rd order Fresnel lens is the only 3rd order and one of only eight Fresnel lenses still in use on the Maine Coast.

The light station was added to the National Register of Historic Places as West Quoddy Head Light Station on July 4, 1980.

==Description==
West Quoddy Head is an easterly-pointing peninsula in southeastern Lubec, overlooking Quoddy Narrows, a strait between Lubec and Campobello Island, Canada, that provides access to Passamaquoddy Bay and harbors located on the St. Croix River and other rivers which empty into the bay. Most of the peninsula is part of Quoddy Head State Park, and the light station is located near the southern end of its eastern face.

A stone sign describes the lighthouse as the &quot;easternmost point in the U.S.A.&quot; It is the easternmost building in the United States (a nearby sign proclaims the &quot;easternmost giftshop in the U.S.&quot;), but the easternmost point is at rocks extending eastward from the shore. The present light station includes a tower, former keeper&#x27;s quarters, service building, and oil house. The tower is circular, and is in height, with the beacon at above sea level. The light, magnified by a third-order Fresnel lens, has a range of . The tower is built of brick, and painted in alternating horizontal red and white stripes. A small gabled entry vestibule, also brick, projects from the tower. The keeper&#x27;s house is a wood-frame structure, 1 stories in height.
==History==
A lighthouse at West Quoddy Head, Maine, was authorized by Congress in 1806. The light station was finished on April 21, 1808, at a cost of $5,000 (). In 1820, Congress authorized the station&#x27;s first fog signal, a bell, costing $1,000 (). The current tower was built in 1858. The present station was built in 1858. The former keeper&#x27;s house now serves as a museum and visitor&#x27;s center. In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 25-cent stamp featuring the West Quoddy Head Light.

* The first keeper was Thomas Dexter.
* 1939: Howard Grey was the last civilian keeper of the station prior to its transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard.
* 1962: As of August 15, 1962, BM1 Bruce Keene was OIC, or Officer-in-Charge (dates of the time he began and ended his tour are not known— he served at least through September 1964.) According to documents in the West Quoddy file, his father, LT Thomas Keene, had previously served as the head keeper of the light station.
* 1963: As of October 27, Keene was still OIC and (Engineman?) Richard Copeland was his assistant.
* 1978: Through May 31 the OIC was BM1 Cliffton Scholfield. He had a crew of two assistants: MK3 Kenneth Fisher (February–July 1977), MT2 Carl Hatch and FN David Blanding.
* 1978: On June 1, BM2 George Eaton took over as the OIC of the station. He had two assistants.
* 1979: MK3 Carl Hatch was a member of the crew.
* 1981: As of September 14, the OIC was BM1 John Richardson.
* 1988: The last OIC (keeper) was Malcolm Rouse, USCG.

<text>HMS &quot;Western Isles was a [[command ship]] of the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], serving as the flagship of the Anti-Submarine Training School at [[Tobermory, Mull|Tobermory]] on the [[Isle of Mull]] under [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] [[Gilbert Stephenson]]. Launched in 1902 as the Dutch [[Batavier Line]] passenger ship Batavier IV&quot;, after the war she served in the Royal Netherlands Navy as the training ship [[His/Her Dutch Majesty&#x27;s Ship|Hr. Ms.]] &quot;Zeearend&quot; (A 892). She was decommissioned in 1970, and scrapped in 1972.
==Ship history==
The ship was built by Gourlay Brothers &amp; Co. of Dundee as a passenger/cargo ship for Wm. H. Müller &amp; Company&#x27;s Batavier Line, and launched as &quot;Batavier IV&quot; in 1902. Of , and with a length of , she was powered by a 3-cylinder triple expansion engine, producing to give a maximum speed of . The ship carried 75 first class and 28 second class passengers, and up to 325 in steerage.

In service on the daily Rotterdam to London route, after the invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 the ship was chartered by the British Ministry of War Transport and was sent to Guernsey to evacuate children in anticipation of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. In June she was transferred to the Royal Navy, and commissioned in September 1940 as HMS &quot;Eastern Isles&quot;, being renamed HMS &quot;Western Isles&quot; in March 1941.

She served as the flagship of Western Approaches Command&#x27;s Anti-Submarine Training School at Tobermory where from about July 1940 all escort ships intended for Atlantic convoy duty attended before being allowed to deploy. A noted depiction of the establishment and its commander is given (albeit in fictional form) in Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. The Training School was closed following the end of World War II in Europe.

In 1946 HMS &quot;Western Isles&quot; was sold to the &quot;Koninklijke Marine&quot; (&quot;Royal Netherlands Navy&quot;). She was converted into a submarine warfare training ship and renamed HNLMS &quot;Zeearend&quot; (A 892). She was finally decommissioned in October 1970, struck from the Navy List in July 1971, and sold for scrapping in November 1972.

<doc id="988477" wikidata="Q1543446" url="?curid=988477" title="Noonan syndrome">
<text>Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder that may present with mildly unusual facial features, short height, congenital heart disease, bleeding problems, and skeletal malformations. Facial features include widely spaced eyes, light-colored eyes, low-set ears, a short neck, and a small lower jaw. Heart problems may include pulmonary valve stenosis. The breast bone may either protrude or be sunken, while the spine may be abnormally curved. Intelligence is often normal. Complications of NS can include leukemia.
A number of genetic mutations can result in Noonan syndrome. The condition may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition or occur as a new mutation. Noonan syndrome is a type of RASopathy, the underlying mechanism for which involves attenuation of the RAS/MAPK cell signaling pathway. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms, medical imaging, and blood tests. Confirmation may be achieved with genetic testing.
No cure for NS is known. Treatment is based on the symptoms and underlying problems, and extra support in school may be required. Growth hormone therapy during childhood can increase an affected person&#x27;s final height. Long-term outcomes typically depend on the severity of heart problems.
An estimated 1 in 1,000 people are mildly affected by NS, while about 1 in 2,000 have a more severe form of the condition. Males appear to be affected more often than females. The condition was named after American pediatric cardiologist Jacqueline Noonan, who described her first case in 1963.
== Signs and symptoms ==

The most common signs leading to the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome are unique facial characteristics and musculoskeletal features. The facial characteristics are most prominent in infancy, becoming less apparent with age in many people with Noonan syndrome.

===Head===

Some of the characteristic features of Noonan syndrome include a large head with excess skin on the back of the neck, low hairline at the nape of the neck, high hairline at the front of the head, triangular face shape, broad forehead, and a short, webbed neck.

In the eyes, hypertelorism (widely set eyes) is a defining characteristic, present in 95% of people with Noonan syndrome. This may be accompanied by epicanthal folds (extra fold of skin at the inner corner of the eye), ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), proptosis (bulging eyes), strabismus (inward or outward turning of the eyes), nystagmus (jerking movement of the eyes) and refractive visual errors.

The nose may be small, wide, and upturned.

The development of the ears and auditory system may be affected in people with Noonan&#x27;s syndrome. This can result in low-set ears (in over 90%), backward-rotated ears (over 90%), thick helix (outer rim) of ear (over 90%), incomplete folding of ears, chronic otitis media (ear infections), and hearing loss.

Development of the mouth may also be affected in Noonan syndrome. This can result in deeply grooved philtrum (top lip line) (over 90%), micrognathia (undersized lower jaw), high arched palate, articulation difficulties (teeth don&#x27;t line up) which can lead to dental problems. Similar to the muscular manifestations above, in the mouth, poor tongue control may be observed.

===Skin===

Skin signs and symptoms in Noonan syndrome include lymphedema (lymph swelling of the extremities), keloid formation, excessive scar formation, hyperkeratosis (overdevelopment of outer skin layer), pigmented nevi (darkly pigmented skin spots), and connective tissue disease.

===Musculoskeletal===
Abnormalities in the limbs and extremities may occur in Noonan syndrome. This may manifest as bluntly ended fingers, extra padding on fingers and toes, edema of the back of hands and tops of feet, and cubitus valgus (wide carrying angle of the elbows).

For short stature, growth hormone is sometimes combined with IGF-1 (or as an alternative, IGF-1 as a stand-alone) can be used to achieve an increased height/final height quicker. The final adult height of individuals with Noonan syndrome is about 161–167 cm in males and 150–155 cm in females, which approaches the lower limit of normal.

Spinal abnormalities may be present up to 30% of the time and this may require surgery to correct in over 60% of these cases. Other musculoskeletal manifestations in Noonan syndrome are associated with undifferentiated connective-tissue disorders which can be associated with joint contractures (tightness) or joint hypermobility (looseness). Additional factors may present in the form of winging of the scapula, scoliosis, breast bone prominence (pectus carinatum), breast bone depression (pectus excavatum). Muscle abnormalities may present as hypotonia (low muscle tone), which may lead to lordosis (increased hollow in the back) due to poor abdominal muscle tone.

===Heart===

Noonan syndrome is the second most common syndromic cause of congenital heart disease. 50-70% of individuals with NS are born with some form of congenital heart defect, with pulmonary valvular stenosis being the most common (50–60%). Other heart defects include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (12–35%), ventricular septal defects (5–20%), and atrial septal defects (10–25%).

===Lungs===

Restrictive lung function has been reported in some people.

===Gastrointestinal===

A number of diverse gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been associated with Noonan syndrome. These include swallowing difficulties, low gut motility, gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying), intestinal malrotation, and frequent or forceful vomiting. These digestive issues may lead to decreased appetite, failure to thrive from infancy to puberty (75%), and occasionally the need for a feeding tube.

===Genitourinary system===

In some males with Noonan syndrome, testicles do not descend (cryptorchidism).

===Circulation===

Lymphatic anomalies including Posterior cervical hygroma (webbed neck) and Lymphedema may present in people with Noonan syndrome.

A number of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan syndrome, these include platelet dysfunction, Blood clotting disorders, partial deficiency of factor VIII:C, partial deficiency of factor XI:C, partial deficiency of factor XII:C, and an imbalance of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity. It has been associated with Von Willebrand disease, Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, combined coagulation defects. When present, these Noonan-syndrome accompanying disorders can be associated with a predisposition to bruise easily, or hemorrhage.

=== Neurological and cognitive impairment ===

Individuals with NS exhibit a broad range of cognitive abilities, typically ranging from mild intellectual disability to completely normal intelligence. Most patients have normal IQ levels (70-120), while around 20% may have cognitive impairment (IQ&lt;70). Occasionally, Chiari malformation (type 1), may occur, which can lead to hydrocephalus. Seizures have also been reported.

=== Bleeding disorders ===
Individuals may experience bleeding disorders of various types, often associated with thrombocytopenia, low levels of clotting factors, impaired platelet function, and more.

== Causes ==

Recurrence in siblings and apparent transmission from parent to child has long suggested a genetic defect with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable expression. Mutations in the Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathways are known to be responsible for about 70% of NS cases.

Individuals with NS have up to a 50% chance of transmitting it to their offspring. However, while 30-75% of cases show a noticeable inheritance from one of the parents, the rest are caused by de-novo genetic mutations occurring for the first time in the affected individual. In such cases, the risk of recurrence is less than 1%, but it still represents a higher risk than in the general population.

The fact that an affected parent is not always identified for children with NS suggests several possibilities:
# Manifestations could be so subtle as to go unrecognized (variable expressivity)
# NS is heterogeneous, comprising more than one similar condition of differing causes, and some of these may not be inherited.
# A high proportion of cases may represent new, sporadic mutations.

=== Correlations between phenotype and genotype ===
Several genes are involved in the genetic etiology of NS, with the key ones being PTPN11 accounting for 50% of genetically diagnosed cases, SOS1 responsible for 10-13% of cases, and RAF1 or RIT1 - each contributing to an additional 5% of cases. Correlations between phenotype and genotype exist, and identifying the genetic cause can shed light on expected symptoms. For example, mutations in the PTPN11 gene are associated with an increased tendency for pulmonary stenosis or leukemia, while mutations in the SOS1 gene are linked to relatively normal development and stature compared to other NS cases. About 15-20% of NS cases remain genetically undiagnosed.
Heterozygous mutations in &quot;NRAS&quot;, &quot;HRAS&quot;, &quot;BRAF&quot;, &quot;SHOC2&quot;, &quot;MAP2K1&quot;, &quot;MAP2K2&quot;, and &quot;CBL&quot; have also been associated with a smaller percentage of NS and related phenotypes.

A condition known as &quot;neurofibromatosis–Noonan syndrome&quot; is associated with neurofibromin.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosing of NS is based on the clinical symptoms presented by the individual, accompanied by attempts to confirm the diagnosis through molecular genetic tests to identify the specific genetic change leading to the condition. However, despite identification of 14 causative genes, the absence of a known mutation will not exclude the diagnosis, as more, as-yet-undiscovered genes can cause NS. Thus, the diagnosis of NS is still based on clinical features. In other words, it is made when a physician feels that a person has enough of the features to warrant the label. The principal values of making a genetic diagnosis are that it guides additional medical and developmental evaluations, it excludes other possible explanations for the features, and it allows more accurate recurrence risk estimates. With more genotype-phenotype correlation studies being performed, a positive genetic diagnosis will help the clinician to be aware of possible anomalies specific to that certain gene mutation. For example, an increase in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen in people with a mutation of &quot;KRAS&quot; and an increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia exists for a mutation of &quot;PTPN11&quot;. In the future, studies may lead to a targeted management of NS symptoms that depends on what genetic mutation a person has.

===Before birth===

Prenatal features that might lead physicians to consider a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome include cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, pleural effusion, and edema.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

While Turner syndrome has similarities with renal anomalies and developmental delay, Turner syndrome is only found in females and often expresses differently. In Turner syndrome, there is a lower incidence of developmental delays, left-sided heart defects are constant and the occurrence of renal abnormalities is much lower.

Other RASopathies
* Watson syndrome - Watson Syndrome has a number of similar characteristics with Noonan&#x27;s Syndrome such as short stature, pulmonary valve stenosis, variable intellectual development, and skin pigment changes.
* Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome - CFC syndrome is very similar to Noonan&#x27;s Syndrome due to similar cardiac and lymphatic features. However, In CFC syndrome intellectual disability and gastrointestinal problems are often more severe and pronounced.  
* Costello syndrome - Like CFC syndrome, Costello syndrome has overlapping features with Noonan&#x27;s Syndrome. However, the conditions can be distinguished by their genetic cause.
* Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) 
* Williams syndrome

==Management==
There is no single treatment tailored to alleviate all possible symptoms of NS. Instead, the treatment varies depending on complications but tend to be quite standard, reflecting the treatment of the general population. Management guidelines, divided by systems, including general, developmental, dental, growth and feeding, cardiovascular, audiological, haematological, renal and skeletal, that account for actions to be taken at diagnosis, after diagnosis and if symptomatic, have been published by an American consortium.

Specifically, treatment of cardiovascular complications resemble that of the general population and treatment of bleeding diathesis is guided by the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation.
* Neuropsychological testing is recommended to find strengths and challenges to tailor support needed for school and career.
* Educational customization such as an individualized education program plan is sometimes needed for school-aged children.
* Speech therapy if speech and articulation issues present
* Physical therapy and occupational therapy for gross- and fine-motor delays
* Hypotonia and motor difficulties often impact handwriting. Accommodations for lessening handwriting demands will improve performance and save long-term hand function.
* Periodic follow up and lifelong monitoring of abnormalities found in any system, especially the cardiovascular system, is recommended.

===Anesthesia risk===
Although a few people with Noonan syndrome have been reported to develop malignant hyperthermia, the gene mutation of diseases known to be associated with malignant hyperthermia is different from that of Noonan syndrome.

== Prognosis ==
The lifespan of people with Noonan&#x27;s syndrome can be similar to the general population, however, Noonan syndrome can be associated with several health conditions that can contribute to mortality. The greatest contributor to mortality in individuals with Noonan syndrome is complications of cardiovascular disease. Prognosis is therefore largely dependent on the presence or absence of cardiac disease, as well as the type and severity of the disease (if disease is present). Most notably, Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with increased mortality.

== History ==

Jacqueline Noonan began practicing as a pediatric cardiologist in 1959 at the University of Iowa when she noticed that children with a rare type of heart defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, often had a characteristic physical appearance, with short stature, webbed neck, wide spaced eyes, and low-set ears. Both boys and girls were affected. These characteristics were sometimes seen running in families but were not associated with gross chromosomal abnormalities. In 1961 she joined University of Kentucky’s College of Medicine, where she continued studying the congenital heart disease and other congenital abnormalities. After examining 833 children with the syndrome, in 1963 presented a paper: &quot;Associated non-cardiac malformations in children with congenital heart disease&quot;. This described nine children who in addition to congenital heart disease had characteristic facial features, chest deformities and short stature.

Dr. John Opitz, a former student of Noonan&#x27;s, first began to call the condition &quot;Noonan syndrome&quot; when he saw children who looked like those whom Dr. Noonan had described. Noonan produced a paper titled &quot;Hypertelorism with Turner Phenotype&quot; in 1968 where she studied 19 patients who displayed symptoms indicative of Noonan&#x27;s Syndrome. In 1971, at the Symposium of Cardiovascular defects, the name &quot;Noonan syndrome&quot; became officially recognized.

<text>The National Learning Network (NLN) was a UK national partnership programme designed to increase the uptake of Information Learning Technology (ILT) across the learning and skills sector in England. Supported by the Learning and Skills Council and other sector bodies, the NLN provided network infrastructure and a wide-ranging programme of support, information and training, as well as the NLN Materials − a substantial range of e-learning content. The initiative began in 1999 with the aim of helping to transform post-16 education. The Government&#x27;s total investment in the NLN totalled £156 million over a five-year period.

Although the network itself is no longer operational, the main output of the initiative − the NLN Materials − continue to represent one of the most substantial and wide-ranging collections of e-learning materials in the UK. Available free to the post-16 sector, they are still actively promoted and updated.

The name National Learning Network is also the name of several centres in Ireland for people with physical and Intellectual disabilities.

== History ==

The seeds for the UK&#x27;s National Learning Network (NLN) were sown in the spring of 1999 through the collaboration of the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and agencies like Becta, NILTA, FEDA and Jisc. This government-funded project resulted in three main developments:

* The Joint Information Services Committee (JISC) that had been managing the Joint Academic Network (JANET) on behalf of UK Universities and Research Councils would now be part-funded by the Further Education Funding Council. Consequently, all UK Colleges of Further Education would be connected to the JANET network and benefit from the data sets and learning resources available through it.
* Support for the newly connected colleges would be provided by the JISC Regional Support Centres (RSC), set up by university and college partnerships to cover all FEFC funding areas. The RSCs&#x27; initial brief was to manage the connection of FE colleges to the JANET network, train local IT staff and provide high level technical support.
* A massive programme of learning materials development would be set up under the name of &quot;National Learning Network&quot; (NLN) to enable Further Education and the Adult and Community Learning (ACL) sectors to make best use of JANET and the enhanced ICT resources that these sectors enjoyed. A substantial body of work was developed by colleges, universities and commercial organisations and were made available to all qualifying parties. NLN has played a significant role in the adoption of Information and Learning Technology (ILT) by the post-16 education sectors in the UK.

== NLN Materials ==

Four rounds of interactive learning materials were commissioned and authored under the NLN banner, covering a wide range of academic and vocational topics. The last body of work − Round 4, adding to the 800 hours of materials already available, was aimed at the Adult and Community Learning sector, covering four main topics: &quot;Family Learning&quot;, &quot;English for Speakers of Other Languages&quot;, &quot;Learning to Learn&quot;, and &quot;Making Learning Work for You&quot;. These materials were made available from winter 2005. Round 1 and 2 of the materials were substantially updated during April to July 2006.

The materials are designed to be used in a variety of formats and delivery platforms, including within a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). To facilitate this, all NLN materials have been packaged as Scorm Learning Objects, with metadata. Most of the LOs can be disaggregated into multiple Shareable Content Objects, and to varying degrees modified and repurposed by practitioners. In total, the NLN Materials consist of 2251 Learning Objects, 800 hours of learning, and have been used in around a third of UK FE institutions, as well as commercial and offender learning contexts.

Xtensis ltd. originally took a consultancy role in the project, gradually increasing their role to hosting the materials to practitioners in the ACL sector, then to all sectors, also introducing a download format that includes a navigational wrapper allowing the materials to be distributed and used on CD/DVD/intranet, while still being valid Scorm Content Packages.

Although most of the institutions involved in their creation have since been disbanded, the materials are still well used. Since 2015, authority of the NLN Materials service has passed to the Education and Training Foundation, with the materials hosted within Xtensis&#x27;s social bookmarking site XtLearn.net which still allows direct access and independent download, but also enables mixing with other content sources from around the web into content collections.

<doc id="988487" wikidata="Q1305789" url="?curid=988487" title="Schlaraffia">
<text>Schlaraffia is a worldwide German-speaking society founded in Prague (then Austrian Empire) in 1859 with a pledge of friendship, art and humor.
The Schlaraffen, an exclusively male organization (many men of a mellower age and in secure positions), meet in midwinter (1 October – 30 April in the northern hemisphere) once per week in their Schlaraffen castle (equipped in the style of a knight&#x27;s tavern from the Middle Ages) for &quot;Sippungen&quot; (gatherings which take place in the fixed ceremonial form of a knight&#x27;s play). In doing so, everyday life is satirized as well as kept alive through recitations of literary and musical forms. An antiquated language with its own vernacular for everyday things (Schlaraffen Latin — for example; &quot;powder pot&quot; for tobacco pipe, &quot;gasoline horse&quot; for car, &quot;castle monster&quot; for mother-in-law) gives the Sippungen their own humorous note. The approximately 280 &quot;Reychs&quot; (local clubs) stay in close contact with one another. Each Schlaraffe is always welcome in every Reich in the world.

Reichs currently exist in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, South Africa, and Australia. The total number of Schlaraffen amounts to about 10,000. New members must be introduced by a Schlaraffe (godfather), complete a probationary period before a general vote is recorded, and start their career as a knave, which leads from the position of squire to knight.

Important artists were and are Schlaraffen (for example, Franz Lehár, Gustl Bayrhammer, Richard Bruno Heydrich, Leopold Matzal, Peter Rosegger and many more).

Their &#x27;mascot&#x27; is the eagle owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) symbolizing wisdom, virtue, and humour (the owl itself presents knowledge and wisdom). In 1874, the association&#x27;s organ &quot;Der Schlaraffia Zeyttungen&quot; appeared for the first time in Leipzig. It still appears today several times a year.

<doc id="988494" wikidata="Q5611358" url="?curid=988494" title="Roscoe Conkling">
<text>Roscoe Conkling (October 30, 1829April 18, 1888) was an American lawyer and Republican politician who represented New York in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. He was a leader of the Republican Stalwart faction and a dominant figure in the United States Senate during the 1870s. As senator, his control of patronage at the New York Customs House, one of the busiest commercial ports in the world, made him very powerful. His comity with President Ulysses S. Grant and conflict with Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and James A. Garfield were defining features of American politics of the 1870s and 1880s. He also participated, as a member of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, in the drafting of the landmark Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Conkling publicly led opposition to proposals for civil service reform, which he called &quot;snivel service reform,&quot; and defended the prerogatives of senators in appointments. His conflict with President Garfield over appointments eventually led to Conkling&#x27;s resignation in 1881. He ran for re-election to his seat in an attempt to display his support from the New York political machine and his power, but lost the special election, during which Garfield was assassinated. Though Conkling never returned to elected office, the assassination elevated Chester A. Arthur, a former New York Collector and Conkling ally, to the presidency. Their relationship was destroyed when Arthur pursued civil service reform, out of his sense of duty to the late President Garfield. Conkling remained active in politics and practiced law in New York City until his death in 1888.

Conkling turned down two presidential appointments to the United States Supreme Court: first to the position of Chief Justice in 1873 and then as an associate justice in 1882. In 1882, Conkling was confirmed by the Senate but declined to serve, the last person (as of 2025) to have done so.

Conkling, who was temperate and detested tobacco, was known for his physical condition, maintained through regular exercise and boxing, an unusual devotion for his time.

==Early life==
===Family===

Roscoe Conkling was born on October 30, 1829, in Albany, New York to Alfred Conkling, a U.S. Representative and federal judge, and his wife Eliza Cockburn, cousin of the late Lord Chief-Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn of England. His father&#x27;s ancestors emigrated to the North America around 1635 and settled in Salem, Massachusetts before moving to Suffolk County, New York. Roscoe&#x27;s maternal grandfather James Cockburn was Scottish by birth, but emigrated to the Bahamas and later to the Mohawk Valley, where he married Margaret Frey, the daughter of a feudal lord.

Roscoe was the youngest of seven children, four sons and three daughters. He had two older brothers, Frederick and Aurelian. A third brother also named Roscoe died before this article&#x27;s subject was born. Both Roscoes were named for the British author William Roscoe, whom Eliza Conkling read during her pregnancy.

Conkling&#x27;s mother was said to have a &quot;talent for repartee and brilliant talk&quot; which her son inherited.

===Childhood===
At the suggestion of William H. Seward, the Conkling family moved to Auburn, New York, via the Erie Canal in 1839. At his new home, Roscoe enjoyed horseback riding, which became a lifelong pursuit. He did not take to academic study, but had a retentive memory.

In 1842, Roscoe was enrolled in the Mount Washington Collegiate Institute in New York City. While in New York, he also studied oratory with his elder brother Frederick. They often practiced their speaking together.

After a year at the Mount Washington Institute, Roscoe entered the Auburn Academy and remained there for three years. Even as a schoolboy, Roscoe&#x27;s intimidating appearance and intellect demanded attention. A childhood friend said young Roscoe &quot;was as large and massive in his mind as he was in his frame, and accomplished in his studies precisely what he did in his social life — a mastery and command which his companions yielded to him as due.&quot;

Conkling first became interested in politics during his time at Auburn. Since his father was a leading member of the upstate Whig Party, Roscoe became acquainted with some of the most prominent men of the era, such as Presidents Martin Van Buren and John Quincy Adams, Governor Enos Throop, Supreme Court Justice Smith Thompson, James Kent, and Thurlow Weed. Fellow Auburn resident William Henry Seward was a friend of Conkling&#x27;s father and soon of Conkling as well.

===Law and local politics===
In 1846, seventeen year-old Conkling moved to Utica to study law in the offices of Joshua A. Spencer and Francis Kernan, two of the leading lawyers in the state. He integrated himself into Utica society and spoke publicly on a variety of issues, especially in support of human rights and the abolition of slavery. At eighteen, he spoke at various venues in Central New York in sympathy for the sufferers of the Great Famine in Ireland. He displayed deep abhorrence for slavery, which he described as &quot;man&#x27;s inhumanity to man,&quot; and referred to himself as a &quot;Seward Whig,&quot; stumping the county for Taylor and Fillmore in 1848.

On one occasion, he is said to have transcribed a Henry Clay speech from memory with such accuracy that Clay himself remarked on its quality. He also practiced his oratory by reciting passages from the Bible, Shakespeare, and British Whigs including Thomas Babington Macaulay, Edmund Burke, and Charles James Fox. In 1849, Conkling gained his first exposure to political campaigning when he was elected as a delegate to his New York State Assembly district&#x27;s Whig nominating convention, then to the state judicial nominating convention as a supporter of Joshua Spencer for the New York Court of Appeals.

Conkling was admitted to the bar in 1850. Almost immediately, Governor Hamilton Fish appointed him as interim district attorney of Oneida County. He was still only twenty-one, and set about prosecuting cases without the aid of more senior co-counsel. He was nominated for re-election that fall but was defeated along with the rest of the Whig ticket. Opposition mainly centered on Conkling&#x27;s youth.

In 1852, Conkling opened a legal partnership with former Mayor of Utica Thomas R. Walker; the partnership continued until 1855. He became famous throughout central New York after his defense of Sylvester Hadcock for forgery; Joshua Spencer was the prosecutor, but Conkling won acquittal by proving Hadcock&#x27;s illiteracy. In 1854, he won a case for slander against a priest who had accused a young woman of &quot;want of chastity.&quot; In 1855, he partnered with his former classmate Montgomery Throop; their partnership continued until 1862. He became one of the highest-paid attorneys in the region, often charging over $100 per trial.

Through 1853, Conkling remained an orthodox Whig. In 1852, he stumped New York state for General Winfield Scott, denouncing Franklin Pierce as a British tool committed to upholding slavery and free trade to fuel the cotton mills of England. In 1853, Conkling was a leading candidate for Attorney General of New York; he lost the Whig nomination to Ogden Hoffman on the third ballot. As the Whig Party rapidly disintegrated, Conkling took an active part in the formation of the Republican Party and came to consider himself an &quot;original Republican.&quot; In 1856, he spoke throughout Oneida and Herkimer counties for John C. Frémont and William L. Dayton.

===Mayor of Utica (1858–59)===
In 1858, Republicans sought a candidate for Mayor of Utica, considered a slightly Democratic city. The party convention nominated Conkling on the first ballot. After a five-day campaign, Conkling defeated Democrat Charles S. Wilson on March 2, 1858, and took office on March 9.

Although he did not run for re-election, Conkling remained mayor until his resignation on November 18, 1859 because the March 1859 election to choose his successor resulted in a tie.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1859–67)==
===First term===

Almost immediately after his nomination for mayor, Conkling prepared to mount a run for Congress; incumbent Representative Orsamus B. Matteson had chosen to retire after his censure for corruption. Conkling&#x27;s chief opponent was another Utica attorney, Charles H. Doolittle. Conkling said he hoped to be elected &quot;because some men object to my nomination. So long as one man in the city opposes, I shall run on the Republican ticket.&quot; Conkling campaigned as a personal ally of Senator Seward, and Seward delivered a speech on Conkling&#x27;s behalf. Conkling won easily on the first ballot of the district convention; Doolittle was nominated by future Conkling ally Ward Hunt.

Conkling&#x27;s opponent in the general election, Judge P. Sheldon Root, had the endorsement of the incumbent Matteson, his former law partner. Root refused to debate Conkling; Conkling stumped the county on his own behalf. Conkling won the election by 2,793 votes out of slightly under 20,000 cast. He ran 200 votes ahead of Governor Edwin D. Morgan.

Conkling&#x27;s first term as Representative was uneventful. He quietly opposed slavery and his speeches largely consisted of legal expositions. Throughout the protracted battle for Speaker that dominated the first session, Conkling supported John Sherman of Ohio. On the second day of the session, December 6, Conkling allegedly rose and stood to guard Thaddeus Stevens as he castigated Southern Representatives, amid fears that they would assault Stevens. (Representative Preston Brooks had beaten Charles Sumner unconscious only three years prior.) On April 17, 1860, Conkling delivered a long address attacking the Taney Court for its decisions in the Dred Scott case and &quot;Ableman v. Booth&quot;. Conkling went so far as to reject judicial review as final, arguing &quot;the judgments of the Supreme Court are binding only upon inferior courts and parties litigant.&quot;

In the second session of the 36th Congress, Conkling voted in favor of a committee to address the growing secession crisis and gave a speech denouncing secession and slavery. He voted in favor of the Morrill Tariff and against the proposed Corwin Amendment, which would have shielded slavery from federal interference as a step toward reconciliation.

===Second term and Civil War===

In the summer of 1860, Conkling campaigned on behalf of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin in New York. Though Conkling was disappointed that Seward had not been nominated, he spoke in favor of Lincoln at a June 4 unity rally. Conkling himself was unanimously re-nominated on September 4 and was re-elected by an increased majority over Utica mayor DeWitt Clinton Grove. As a high-profile House freshman, he spent much more of the 1860 campaign outside his district.

Given his first opportunity to advise President-elect Lincoln on federal appointments in Oneida, Conkling rejected a list provided by district Republicans, replying, &quot;Gentlemen, when I need your assistance in making the appointments in our district, I shall let you know.&quot;
In 1861, Conkling teamed up with Chester A. Arthur and another man, George W. Chadwick, to make a profit on wartime cotton. The business worked well and was expunged from public record. Conkling later secured Arthur&#x27;s appointment as a tax commissioner; Arthur was appointed Collector of the Port of New York in 1871.

The 37th Congress met amidst the American Civil War, which began in April 1861. President Lincoln called Congress into a special session on Independence Day in order to equip an army. Conkling took a leading role in the session and was joined in the House by his elder brother Frederick, who had been elected from New York City. Conkling was promoted to chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia. He introduced a bill to &quot;establish an auxiliary watch for the protection of public and private property in the city of Washington&quot; and another instituting a committee to report on the subject of a general bankruptcy law.

When Congress reconvened on December 3, 1861, Conkling introduced a resolution calling for the War Department to investigate the humiliating Union defeat at the Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff. When George McClellan responded that an investigation would be incompatible with the public service, Conkling delivered a speech calling the battle &quot;the most atrocious military murder ever committed in our history as a people,&quot; gaining national attention. His persistent criticism led to the creation of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War to provide civilian oversight of the war effort.

Conkling was a consistent opponent of issuing paper currency to pay for the war effort, unsuccessfully voting against the Legal Tender Act of 1862 and proposing bond issuances redeemable in gold as substitutes. He remained a consistent opponent of monetary expansion throughout his career.

===Out of office===

Conkling was renominated by party faithful at Rome on September 26, 1862. He was opposed by his former law teacher, Democrat Francis Kernan, running on a ticket led by Conkling&#x27;s brother-in-law, Horatio Seymour, for Governor. Local Democrats quoted criticism of Conkling by radical Representative Elihu Washburne and cited Frederick Conkling&#x27;s vote against an expansion of the Erie Canal which would have benefitted Roscoe&#x27;s district. He may also have suffered from the disproportionate enlistment of Republican voters in the Union Army and a growing sentiment opposed to the war in general. Conkling was ultimately narrowly defeated by Kernan by 98 votes, and Seymour was once again elected Governor. Conkling ran behind the Republican gubernatorial candidate, radical James S. Wadsworth, in Oneida.

After leaving office, Conkling returned to Utica and resumed a solo law practice. He continued to give public speeches on occasion, criticizing Governor Seymour. From 1863 to 1865, he acted informally as a judge advocate of the War Department, investigating alleged frauds in the recruiting service in western New York. In the summer of 1863, he and Kernan were opposing counsel in a case regarding an Army deserter.

In 1864, Conkling remained an active supporter of President Lincoln and endorsed his re-nomination and re-election. He rebuffed efforts, including a direct appeal from Horace Greeley, to replace Lincoln on the ticket with a more radical candidate. Conkling was re-nominated on the Union ticket, despite some opposition, on September 22. At the district convention, Ward Hunt produced a letter from Lincoln claiming no other candidate &quot;could be more satisfactory to me&quot; than Conkling. He was nominated by a large vote, but declined. A second vote was taken reaffirming his nomination by acclamation, whereupon he accepted. In the fall election, with a much-improved war effort and political environment for the Lincoln administration, Conkling defeated Kernan to reclaim his seat.

In the time before Conkling returned to the House, President Lincoln was inaugurated, the Civil War came to a close, and Lincoln was assassinated on April 14. Conkling was among the first Union men to arrive in Richmond after its fall, on a fact-finding mission with Charles Dana. He and Seymour also accompanied Lincoln&#x27;s funeral procession from Albany to Utica.

===Third term===

Returning to Congress in December 1865, Conkling was appointed to the powerful Committee on Ways and Means, serving alongside future Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and James A. Garfield. He also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was among the committee&#x27;s most active supporters of enfranchising freed slaves.

==== Reconstruction and the Fourteenth Amendment ====
Within the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, Conkling was a relatively conservative member of the Republican majority, in sympathy with chairman William Pitt Fessenden and in contrast to radicals George S. Boutwell and Jacob Howard.

He subscribed neither to the constitutional theory of secession advanced by the radical Thaddeus Stevens or Charles Sumner, who held that secession (or dissolution of the Southern states) had been achieved, leaving Congress plenary power to govern their territory, or of President Andrew Johnson, which held that secession was impossible and that the Southern states remained in the Union. Instead, Conkling endorsed the theory advanced by Samuel Shellabarger and Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, which held that secession was impossible and void, but that states had lapsed from the guaranteed republican form of government, thus entitling Congress to prescribe the steps for reinstating a proper government.

In order to establish these steps, the Joint Committee began work on the Fourteenth Amendment. Conkling took an active part in drafting the amendment, particularly its provision on representation, Section 2. His draft excluded, for the purpose of apportioning representation, all persons of a race or color whose political or civil rights and privilege were denied, thus punishing the jurisdiction which so denied them. Conkling was also responsible for substituting the word &quot;persons&quot; for &quot;citizens&quot; in Section 2.

==== Blaine-Fry affair ====

Conkling&#x27;s long rivalry with James G. Blaine had its roots in his final term as Representative. In April 1865, in connection with his work for the War Department, Conkling had been selected as a special prosecutor in the case of Major John A. Haddock, who as provost marshal was responsible for administering the draft in western New York and accused of flagrant corruption. Conkling zealously secured a conviction but retained a grudge against Haddock&#x27;s commanding officer, General James Barnet Fry, whom Conkling believed was truly responsible for the corrupt conduct of Haddock&#x27;s office. At the opening of the 39th Congress, Conkling introduced a resolution, which passed, to study the potential of eliminating Fry&#x27;s position of Provost-Marshal General.

In April 1866, a bill to reorganize the army was introduced which would have made Provost-Marshal General a permanent office. On April 24, Conkling rose to strike this section, on the grounds that it &quot;create[d] an unnecessary office for an undeserving public servant. It fastens, as an incubus upon the country, a hateful instrument of war, which deserves no place in a free government in a time of peace.&quot; Blaine, who had by then already clashed with Conkling on a number of matters in the House, replied in vehement defense of Fry, though they were not acquainted. In the ensuing debate, both Blaine and Conkling exchanged sharp personal attacks, before Conkling offered to settle the matter &quot;not here but elsewhere.&quot; The argument was renewed several times during the week, until April 30, when Blaine read a letter into the record which he had written with General Fry, taking issue with Conkling&#x27;s statement and making specific charges of graft in connection with Conkling&#x27;s work for the War Department. After Conkling&#x27;s rebuttal, the debate culminated in an oft-quoted speech in which Blaine derided Conkling&#x27;s &quot;haughty disdain, his grandiloquent swell, his majestic, supereminent, overpowering, turkey-gobbler strut,&quot; prompting Conkling later to demand an apology that Blaine refused to give.

Though the charges by Fry were investigated and unanimously dismissed by an investigatory committee as having &quot;no foundation in truth&quot; and Conkling&#x27;s conduct as &quot;above reproach... eminently patriotic and valuable,&quot; Conkling never forgave Blaine. Their personal animosities shaped Republican presidential politics for the next two decades and possibly cost Blaine the presidency in 1884 when Conkling, still a power in the closely fought state of New York, not only refused to help Blaine, but worked for his defeat.

==U.S. Senator (1868–81)==
===1867 election===

Conkling was re-elected to the House over Palmer Kellogg in November 1866. Confident of his victory in advance, Conkling spent the fall campaign working on behalf of other Republicans in an effort to actively, privately seek the United States Senate seat of Ira Harris, whose term expired in the coming March. By campaigning throughout the state, he studied the political situation in every county and secured the allegiances of local party leaders. The political organization he formed in his canvas for Senate later formed the basis for the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party.

With Republicans firmly in control of the state legislature, the election would be determined by the Republican caucus, where the field gradually dwindled to Harris, Conkling, and Judge Noah Davis, who was backed by Governor Reuben Fenton and most of western New York. Conkling was endorsed in the caucus by Andrew Dickson White, a signal that his candidacy was backed by George William Curtis, and was nominated on the fifth ballot after the small minority of Harris men chose him over Davis.

Conkling joined the Senate as a member of the Committees on Appropriations, the Judiciary, and Mines and Mining. He became a popular subject of press attention and was even mentioned as a potential candidate for president in 1868.

===Impeachment of Andrew Johnson===

Conkling was a frequent critic of President Andrew Johnson and supporter of aggressive Reconstruction policies.

In Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial for the removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Conkling did not serve as a manager or make any public speech but was active in the prosecution of the case. He voted guilty on several articles before the Senate adjourned. Conkling fell ill while the Senate remained in recess, but declared that if he were unable to walk or speak, he would still be carried to the chamber with the word &quot;Guilty&quot; pinned to his coat.

The Senate fell one vote short of convicting Johnson and removing him from office. Conkling remained Johnson&#x27;s antagonist for the remainder of the latter&#x27;s term.

===Grant administration===
Conkling actively supported the Ulysses S. Grant administration and its policy in Santo Domingo, including the Annexation of Santo Domingo. He became known as the &quot;Warwick of the [Grant] Administration.&quot;

During the Franco-Prussian War, Conkling expressed his sympathies with the German side, arguing that Napoleon III&#x27;s support of the Confederates in the Civil War had made him the enemy of the United States. Nevertheless, Conkling defended the administration from Charles Sumner&#x27;s charges of violating neutrality by selling arms to France.

In 1870, New York elected its first Democratic legislature since the War. When the new legislature repealed and rescinded its prior resolution ratifying the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Conkling spoke out against it. He actively worked for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, opposing attempts by Senator Allen Thurman to water down its provisions.

In the 43rd United States Congress, Conkling opposed federal relief for the Boston Fire of 1872, efforts to establish a uniform national system of bankruptcy law, and an increase in congressional salaries. He spoke against seating Republican senator Alexander Caldwell of Kansas, who stood accused of bribery and ultimately resigned. He served on the committees on Foreign Relations, Commerce, and the Judiciary, and chaired the committee on the Revision of Laws.

In 1873, after the death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, President Grant urged him to accept an appointment to the seat, but Conkling declined. He stated, &quot;I could not take the place, for I would be forever gnawing my chains.&quot; Instead, Grant nominated George Henry Williams, who was rejected by the Senate. Conkling declined once more, and Grant appointed Morrison Waite, who was confirmed.

==== Credit Mobilier scandal ====
In September 1872, the New York newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; reported that many republican politicians were bribed by Union Pacific Railroad and Credit Mobilier. Later on The house created the Poland Committee to investigate these accusations. In December 1872, the committee received allegations on many high-tier Republican officials, including Conkling. By February 1873, the committee was convinced that they should share this information with the senate. The senate created the Morrill committee named after Lot M. Morrill to help with the investigation. Conkling&#x27;s testimony convinced The Morrill Committee to clear his name from the charges.

====1873 election====

After the Democratic victories in the 1870 state elections, Conkling&#x27;s political future was uncertain. Conkling privately told friends he did not expect re-election. He was offered a $50,000 yearly salary as a law partner in New York City but turned it down. However, after victories in 1871 and 1872, Conkling was re-elected without much competition or fanfare.

====Power struggle with Reuben Fenton====

In 1869, upon the retirement of William H. Seward as secretary of state and the defeat of senior senator Edwin D. Morgan, Senator Conkling suddenly became the most senior figure in the New York Republican Party. His new junior colleague, former governor Reuben Fenton, quickly gained President Grant&#x27;s ear and claimed to have control over presidential appointments in New York. Conkling and Fenton also disagreed over proposed amendments to the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, which had given rise to the controversy over Johnson&#x27;s removal of Secretary Stanton. Fenton supported repeal of the bill entirely, in line with the position of the New York Legislature.

Fenton&#x27;s influence with Grant evidently came to an end in 1870, when Grant appointed Conkling&#x27;s choice for Collector of the Port of New York, Thomas Murphy. Only Fenton, Charles Sumner, and Joseph S. Fowler voted against the appointment as Republicans. After this, Conkling was more influential with the Grant administration than any senator except Oliver Morton. At the 1870 state convention, Conkling and his allies accused Fenton of a corrupt bargain with Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall for control of the New York City party organization; many of Fenton&#x27;s supporters held sinecures in city government. The Republicans lost the 1870 election by a wide margin; Conkling blamed the loss on betrayal by the Fenton faction.

In 1871, Conkling gained Grant&#x27;s support to reform the New York City organization. State chairman Alonzo Cornell removed the &quot;Tammany Republicans&quot; over Fenton&#x27;s objection and founded a successor organization led by Horace Greeley and Jackson S. Schultz; Greeley declined and joined Fenton&#x27;s organization instead, precipitating a struggle for power within the city party. The struggle was ended at the 1871 state convention in Syracuse. Hamilton Ward Sr. suggested that each organization be given half the vote of New York County, but Conkling successfully prevented this move, delivering an extemporaneous speech:

A horde of ballot-box pirates and robbers have clutched by the throat the greatest city of the Western world. A horde of pirates, whose firm-name is Tammany Hall… is presenting in its own organization the most hideous spectacle in modern history, has disbanded, tampered with, and to a large part controlled that glorious organization which is the brightest in the annals of political parties…

The delegates voted to seat the Conkling delegation, and the party platform included an endorsement of President Grant and condemnation of &quot;astounding revelations of fraud and corruption in the city of New York.&quot; For the next decade, Conkling was the undisputed leader of the New York Republican Party. Fenton eventually left the party entirely in 1872, supporting the new Liberal Republican Party, which nominated Greeley for president in opposition to Grant.

===Hayes administration===
Conkling and President Rutherford B. Hayes got off to a rocky start after Hayes named William M. Evarts, a New York opponent of Conkling&#x27;s machine, as secretary of state. In addition to elevating a Conkling critic, the appointment precluded Conkling&#x27;s ally Thomas C. Platt from joining the cabinet as postmaster general on grounds of regional diversity; traditionally, only one cabinet member could come from a state.

In April 1877, Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman appointed a commission, chaired by John Jay (lawyer), to investigate the New York Custom House. The investigation brought to light extensive irregularities in the service, showing that the federal office holders in New York were rather a large army of political workers and that their positions were secured by and dependent upon their faithful service on behalf of New York City politicians.

After Conkling returned from a European vacation, he took an active part in the 1877 New York state campaign. He and Platt were openly critical of the Hayes administration at the state convention, passing a number of resolutions endorsing Grant over the objection of reformer George William Curtis. Conkling gave a lengthy speech denouncing Curtis, Hayes, and reformers and praising Grant.

The Conkling-Hayes conflict peaked in December 1877, when Hayes nominated Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and L. Bradford Prince to replace Chester Arthur and Alonzo Cornell as the Collector and Naval Officer, respectively, of the Port. The appointments were made on the basis of findings of corruption at the Port of New York by a commission of independent, anti-Conkling Republicans. The nominations were rejected by a vote of 25 to 32, with six Republicans voting for and two Democrats voting against. After the vote, a disagreement between Conkling and Senator John Brown Gordon of Georgia nearly resulted in a duel between the two men, but their friends defused the situation.

Nevertheless, Hayes suspended Arthur and Cornell&#x27;s service on July 11, 1878, and appointed Edwin Atkins Merritt and Silas W. Burt during the congressional recess. Both were confirmed when Congress reconvened in February.

====1879 election====

In January 1879, Conkling was re-nominated by acclamation and re-elected to a third term easily.

===Garfield administration and resignation===

Shortly after James Garfield&#x27;s victory in the 1880 election, Conkling consulted with friends on his future. Though he sought to resign over his differences with Garfield, they urged him to remain in office. Garfield solicited his advice on &quot;several subjects relating to the next administration—and especially in reference to New York interests&quot; and invited Conkling to visit him in Mentor, Ohio. Their conversation there, in private with no witnesses, remained the subject of debate long after both men&#x27;s deaths.

Garfield assembled a cabinet including James Blaine as secretary of state and Thomas Lemuel James, a New York enemy of Conkling&#x27;s, as postmaster general. He refused to appoint Conkling&#x27;s proposed candidate, Levi P. Morton, for Secretary of the Treasury. Garfield further angered Conkling when he removed Edwin Atkins Merritt as Collector of the Port of New York during his term and appointed Judge William H. Robertson. Historians disagree over whether Garfield did so at Blaine&#x27;s insistence rather than on his own initiative.

Merritt&#x27;s removal halfway through his term and Robertson&#x27;s appointment pressed Conkling to action. He resigned from the Senate May 16, expecting vindication of his own political strength and of the principle of senatorial courtesy by winning the special election to his seat. Thomas C. Platt resigned alongside him.

Conkling&#x27;s gambit failed: although he attended the legislature&#x27;s sessions in Albany, Elbridge Lapham was chosen as his successor. Any chance of Conkling&#x27;s re-election was likely ended, and his political career with it, when President Garfield was shot on July 2 by Charles Guiteau, a fellow Stalwart who had cited the Blaine appointment in threats to the President. Though Garfield was still alive when the election finally concluded on July 22, he died on September 19. Conkling&#x27;s long-time protégé, Chester Arthur, succeeded to the presidency.

==Presidential politics==

As a senator and the boss of the New York Republicans, Conkling was a kingmaker at multiple Republican Conventions. After supporting President Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 and 1872, Conkling ran an unsuccessful campaign of his own in 1876. In 1880, he supported the nomination of Grant for a third term.

Though his preferred candidate was not nominated for president in either case, he was successful in preventing the nomination of an outright reformer. Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s nomination as vice president in 1880 was designed to appease Conkling (though Arthur accepted over Conkling&#x27;s objection) and led to Arthur&#x27;s succession as president after the assassination of James Garfield.

===1868 and 1872===
Conkling was an active supporter of Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s three presidential campaigns. In 1868, he actively campaigned for Grant against his own brother-in-law, Horatio Seymour.

As the 1872 campaign shaped up, Conkling established himself as one of the foremost defenders of the Grant administration. When Charles Sumner introduced a constitutional amendment to limit the presidency to one term in 1871, Conkling spoke against its passage.

Conkling led a barnstorming tour across New York state, beginning in Manhattan on July 23. His speech there was issued, in abridged form, by the state party as a central piece of the Republican campaign in the state. Conkling spoke against Horace Greeley in personal terms, drawing criticism from the Democratic and Liberal Republican press. His next speech was on August 8, after which he hosted a meet-and-greet with President Grant at his mansion in Utica. Grant won the election over Greeley easily, and the Republican ticket swept New York.

===1876 campaign===

Soon after his re-election to the Senate, Conkling became a leading choice to succeed President Grant. He had the support of Grant and the unanimous backing of the New York Republicans. A public meeting was held in Utica on March 2 to endorse his candidacy, and the Republican state convention on March 22 endorsed Conkling for president. Conkling named as his own second choice Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, likely to block his rival James G. Blaine from winning the nomination.

At the Republican Convention in Cincinnati on June 14, the New York delegation actively worked to secure Conkling&#x27;s nomination, and his name was placed forward by Stewart L. Woodford. The other candidates named were Marshall Jewell, Oliver P. Morton, Benjamin Bristow, John Hartranft, Hayes, and Conkling&#x27;s personal rival James G. Blaine.

After Conkling&#x27;s vote slipped lower on the first five ballots, a member of the Indiana delegation began a stampede to Hayes, who was nominated. New Yorker William A. Wheeler was nominated for vice president. Conkling pledged to make four speeches on behalf of Hayes, but made only one, claiming ill health.

Conkling played an active part in resolving the disputed election. Acting on the advice of President Grant, he helped write and pass the bill establishing the Electoral Commission of 1877, tasked with resolving the dispute between Hayes and Samuel Tilden. He gave a powerful speech urging its constitutionality and its passage as a means of avoiding violence, but declined to serve on the Committee himself. Conkling&#x27;s own position on the controversy was that neither Tilden nor Hayes should be inaugurated, frequently reported as an implicit endorsement of Tilden.

===1880 convention===

As the 1880 election approached, a growing movement favored the nomination of President Grant for a third term. Conkling, along with Senators J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois, were at its head. At the 1880 state convention, Conkling secured a binding resolution pledging New York&#x27;s delegates to Grant.

At the national convention, Conkling moved to have all delegates pledge their support to the eventual nominee. After James A. Garfield, a supporter of Senator John Sherman of Ohio for president, delivered a well-received speech against the resolution, Conkling sent him a note which read, &quot;New York requests that Ohio&#x27;s real candidate and dark horse come forward.&quot; Conkling then withdrew his motion.

On the fourth day, Conkling placed Grant&#x27;s name in nomination, and the nomination was seconded by William O&#x27;Connell Bradley. Grant&#x27;s strongest opponents were Conkling&#x27;s rivals James G. Blaine and Sherman, who was nominated by Garfield. Conkling marshaled the Grant delegates through dozens of successive ballots, never wavering in his support. On the fifth night, some delegates suggested that Conkling could be nominated if he would withdraw Grant&#x27;s name; he declined. The non-Grant delegates struggled to find an alternative candidate, but it became clear they would not support Grant under any circumstances.

On the sixth day, Garfield emerged as the consensus anti-Grant choice. He received the necessary majority on the thirty-sixth ballot of the convention, and Conkling moved to make his nomination unanimous. The Garfield campaign sought to reconcile with Conkling&#x27;s Stalwarts by offering one of them the vice presidential nomination. They first approached Levi P. Morton; Conkling was still angry over Grant&#x27;s loss and advised Morton to decline, which he did. Garfield&#x27;s supporters then offered the nomination to Chester A. Arthur, who they knew had close ties to Conkling, but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker a compromise on the selection of a permanent chairman at the start of the convention. Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting, urging him to &quot;drop it as you would a red hot shoe from the forge,&quot; but Arthur insisted that he would, calling the vice presidency &quot;a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining.&quot; Arthur won the nomination with 468 votes to 193 for Elihu Washburne and 44 for Marshall Jewell.

===1880 campaign===
During the general election campaign, Conkling conspicuously avoided Garfield, declining the nominee&#x27;s invitations to meet. When a conference of Republican leaders convened at the Fifth Avenue Hotel to meet with Garfield, Conkling left his seat conspicuously vacant. In response to entreaties from friends, he simply replied, &quot;There are some matters which must be attended to before I can enter the canvass.&quot; This remark was widely reprinted in press throughout the North as evidence of Garfield&#x27;s weak position.

Conkling only began to campaign actively after Grant and Arthur personally prevailed upon him to do so. Conkling gave a well-received speech at New York&#x27;s Academy of Music, then travelled west to deliver a series of speeches in Ohio alongside President Grant. At the insistence of Grant and Senator Cameron, they stopped at Garfield&#x27;s home in Mentor. During his entire visit, Conkling refused to be left alone with Garfield. He made four more speeches in Indiana, then returned to New York for the remainder of the campaign.

==Positions and views==
Conkling was a Radical Republican, favoring equal rights for ex-slaves and reduced rights for ex-Confederates. He was active in framing and pushing the legislation framing Reconstruction, including the Civil Rights Act of 1875.

Conkling defended a proposal ordering the construction of a transcontinental telegraph to the Pacific Ocean.

He also championed the broad interpretation of the ex post facto clause in the Constitution. (See &quot;Stogner v. California&quot;)

===Temperance===
Conkling was a moderate on the issue of alcohol. In 1873, Conkling submitted a resolution on behalf of the temperance movement within his district and spoke in support of the movement&#x27;s aims at the 1873 state convention, but denounced any &quot;irrational effort&quot; to ban alcohol as indefensible.

===Monetary policy===
While in the House, Conkling notably broke with the Republican Party over the passage of the Legal Tender Act, which established Treasury notes as legal currency in order to better fund the war effort. In this opposition he was joined by his brother, Frederick Augustus Conkling. Both were &quot;hard money&quot; men, arguing that the only legal tender could be precious metals (gold and silver) and that the war could be won without extending the Union&#x27;s line of credit. Instead, he argued for reducing the costs of government by cutting salaries and limiting congressional travel expenses.

Conkling also vigorously opposed the so-called &quot;inflation bill&quot;, which would have authorized an additional $46 million in bank notes. The bill passed, but President Grant vetoed it and a compromise was reached.

He was an active opponent of the Bland-Allison Act and any legislation attempting to increase the supply of silver.

===Civil rights and Reconstruction===
Conkling was a lifelong advocate for civil rights for freed black Americans. He remained an advocate for Southern Reconstruction long past its political popularity in the North and even beyond President Hayes&#x27;s decision to withdraw federal troops from Southern states.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
In 1877, Conkling presented a petition on behalf of citizens of New York, mostly women, calling for an amendment granting all women the right to vote.

==Retirement==
After resigning from the Senate in 1881, Conkling returned to the practice of law.

As one of the original drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment, he claimed in a case which reached the Supreme Court, &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), that the phrase &quot;nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws&quot; meant the drafters wanted corporations to be included, because they used the word &quot;person&quot; and cited his personal diary from the period. Howard Jay Graham, a Stanford University historian considered the pre-eminent scholar on the Fourteenth Amendment, named this case the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and concluded that Conkling probably perjured himself for the benefit of his railroad friends.

===Relationship with President Arthur===
Conkling and Arthur were so intimately associated that it was feared, after President Garfield was assassinated, that the killing had been done at Conkling&#x27;s behest in order to install Arthur as president and bring about restoration of the patronage system of political appointments. After Arthur assumed the presidency upon Garfield&#x27;s death in September 1881, Conkling attempted to sway his protégé into reversing the earlier appointment by Garfield of William H. Robertson as Collector of the Port of New York. Arthur, who would become an avid champion of civil service reform, refused.

On February 24, 1882, Arthur nominated Conkling as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, following the retirement of Ward Hunt. Arthur submitted the nomination to the Senate not knowing whether Conkling would accept it or not. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1882, by a 39–12 vote, but declined to serve in a letter to Arthur citing &quot;reasons you would not fail to appreciate.&quot;

The breach between Arthur and Conkling was never repaired. Without Conkling&#x27;s leadership, his Stalwart faction dissolved. However, upon Arthur&#x27;s death in 1886, he attended the funeral and showed deep sorrow according to onlookers.

==Personal life==
During his first term as Senator, Conkling purchased a mansion in Utica (3 Rutger Park) that remained his primary residence until his death. He adorned his walls with photos of Lord Byron, Daniel Webster, William W. Eaton, and Antonio López de Santa Anna (presented to Conkling&#x27;s father during his time as Minister to Mexico).

Conkling was an avid reader of poetry, particularly the works of Lord Byron. He sometimes quoted or recited poetry in his speeches. He made careful study of British oratory throughout his life, and was a particular admirer of Thomas Babington Macaulay.

Conkling was a personal friend and political ally of Senator Blanche Bruce, whom he defended against both racist and reformist critics, and who named his son Roscoe Conkling Bruce in honor of their friendship.

===Marriage and romantic affairs===

Conkling married Julia Catherine Seymour, sister of Governor of New York Horatio Seymour, on June 28, 1855; Horatio was strongly opposed to the marriage and remained a forceful political opponent of Conkling&#x27;s. Their marriage was unhappy; Conkling focused on politics and was frequently unfaithful. They became estranged as early as 1863.

Conkling had a reputation as a philanderer, and was accused of having an affair with the married Kate Chase Sprague, daughter of Salmon P. Chase and wife of William Sprague IV. According to a well-known story, buttressed by contemporaneous press reports, Mr. Sprague confronted the philandering couple at the Spragues&#x27; Rhode Island summer home and pursued Conkling with a shotgun. One posthumous account from &quot;The New York Times&quot; (October 12, 1909) stated:

The late Senator Roscoe Conkling was a frequent visitor at Canonchet [Sprague&#x27;s estate], and was unpleasantly conspicuous in the proceedings which ended in the divorce of the Spragues. Mr. Conkling was once forbidden by Mr. Sprague to come to Canonchet. Despite this, however, the Executive [Sprague] later met the Senator [Conkling] on the estate coming from the rear of the house—some reports had it that the Senator jumped from a window—and after him came the Governor with his old civil war musket in his hands.

===Physical fitness===
Throughout his life, Conkling was noted for his advocacy of physical culture, a somewhat unorthodox pastime for a man of his era and social status. Conkling maintained his physique through horseback riding and boxing. He took daily walking trips throughout his life.

Stories of his boxing exploits frequently appeared in the press, though their accuracy is questioned. Perhaps due to his massive frame (6&#x27;3&quot;) and dominant physical presence, Conkling drew frequent press attention. Despite his pride in his physique, Conkling was known to have a peculiar aversion to &quot;having his person touched.&quot;

In the summer of 1868, Conkling, Louis Agassiz, Samuel Hooper, and others traveled to the Rocky Mountains, including a visit to Pike&#x27;s Peak.

In his retirement, he became a governing member of the New York Athletic Club.

==Death and legacy==
On March 12, 1888, Conkling attempted to walk home three miles from his law office on Wall Street through the Great Blizzard of 1888. Conkling made it as far as Union Square before collapsing. He contracted pneumonia and developed mastoiditis several weeks later which, following a surgical procedure to drain the infection, progressed to meningitis. Conkling died in the early morning hours of April 18, 1888. After leaving the Senate, Conkling had reconciled with Mrs. Conkling, and both his wife and daughter were with him when he died. Conkling is buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Utica.

===Legacy===
Chauncey Depew, the noted railroad executive, political observer and himself a member of the United States Senate from New York from 1899 to 1911, commented thus more than 30 years after Conkling&#x27;s death: &quot;[Roscoe Conkling] was created by nature for a great career ... he was the handsomest man of his time ... his mental equipment nearly approached genius ... [but] with all his oratorical power and his talent in debate, he made little impression on the country and none upon posterity ... The reason for this was that his wonderful gifts were wholly devoted to partisan discussions and local issues.&quot;
A statue of him stands in Madison Square Park in New York City. Conkling is the namesake to the hamlets Roscoe, New York, Roscoe, South Dakota, and Roscoe, Georgia and Roscoe Conkling Park, a park in Utica, New York containing a zoo, golf course, and ski area. His house in Utica was made a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Los Angeles&#x27;s Roscoe Boulevard may or may not have been named after him.

Conkling&#x27;s stature as a powerful politician—and the interests of others in currying favor with him—led to many babies being named for him. These include Roscoe C. Patterson, Roscoe Conkling Oyer, Roscoe Conkling Simmons, Roscoe Conkling Giles, Roscoe Conkling Bruce, Roscoe C. McCulloch, Roscoe Conkling Ensign Brown and Roscoe Conkling (&quot;Fatty&quot;) Arbuckle. Arbuckle&#x27;s father, however, despised Conkling and named the boy because he suspected the boy wasn&#x27;t his own, and as a nod towards Conkling&#x27;s reputation as a philanderer. Roscoe Conkling Brown Sr., the father of Roscoe C. Brown Jr., changed his own name from George to honor Conkling.

==In popular culture==
Conkling was an important character in Rosemary Simpson&#x27;s 2017 detective novel &quot;What the Dead Leave Behind&quot;.

To spite his large son, whose delivery he believed hastened his petite wife&#x27;s death and whose great size implied infidelity, William Goodrich Arbuckle named his child Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle in reference to the politician&#x27;s numerous extramarital affairs.

<doc id="988498" wikidata="Q1734041" url="?curid=988498" title="Karmapa controversy">
<text>There are currently two, separately enthroned 17th Gyalwang Karmapas: Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje. The Karmapa is the spiritual leader of the nine-hundred-year-old Karma Kagyu lineage of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.

Divisiveness started in the early and mid 1990s, with semi-public accusations of impropriety from those closely involved, and continued for several years thereafter. The recognition of the 17th Karmapa created a split within the Karma Kagyu lineage. Tai Situ Rinpoche recognized Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa, and Shamar Rinpoche disagreed and chose Trinley Thaye Dorje as the rightful claimant to the title of the 17th Karmapa. As the years passed, separate sets of organizations and highly recognized lamas, or teachers, supported one Karmapa or the other. Despite an intriguing history, the high lamas involved met on good terms and issued statements that they are confident there will be an amicable solution.

In 2018, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje met for the first time to begin creating a personal relationship with one another, and to encourage their spiritual communities to heal the divisions and join in efforts to help preserve the Karma Kagyu tradition. In 2020, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje jointly announced they would work together to find the next incarnation of the Shamar Rinpoche, historically considered second in importance to the Karma Kagyu lineage after the Gyalwang Karmapa, similar to the Panchen Lama&#x27;s role as second in importance in the Gelugpa school after the Dalai Lama.

On December 4, 2023 Thaye Dorje and Ogyen Trinley Dorje wrote a statement, that they would recognize the 15th Shamar Rinpoche together, as well as oversee his education, empowerments and instructions. The two Karmapas asked all students of the Karma Kagyu to regret their past actions, and have the firm resolve to never split into factions again.

==Background==
This is not the first controversy around a Karmapa incarnation. The recognitions of the Karmapa incarnations are of central importance in the Karma Kagyu lineage. The 8th, 10th, and 12th incarnations, as well as the widely renowned 16th Karmapa, experienced minor conflicts during their recognitions, each of which was ultimately resolved.

The 14th Shamar Rinpoche, nephew of the 16th Karmapa, traveled alongside him during his escape to Bhutan from Tibet. In 1964, the eight year old was granted permission by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile to be officially recognized. With the 172-year ban on recognizing Shamarpa reincarnations lifted, Shamar Rinpoche reclaimed his place as senior student and deputy of the Karmapa. The ban had begun after the 10th Sharmapa was accused by members of the Karma Kagyu lineage of being a traitor, and of instigating the Sino-Nepalese War between Tibet and Nepal. The ban affected Shamar Rinpoche&#x27;s lineage and supporting administration, but his enthronement in 1964 at the Rumtek Monastery allowed him back into his historical position as the second-ranking lama of the Karma Kagyu lineage, following the 16th Karmapa.

Incarnations like the 12th Shamarpa, son of the 15th Karmapa, enjoyed more leniency—but not official recognition—from the government thanks to the close personal relationship of that Karmapa and the 13th Dalai Lama.

The Karmapas traditionally predict their deliberately chosen rebirths, and prepare their predictions for their closest students so as to be located after birth. Although not strictly defined, the usual process to locate, recognize and enthrone a Karmapa incarnation was facilitated quietly by those previously close students, collaboratively and behind closed doors. Multiple judgements ensured harmony and continuity of the lineage. Among the collaborative participants, the Shamar Rinpoches have played an important role in confirming the identity of the Karmapas for several centuries. The Tai Situ Rinpoches and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoches have played similar roles, as the circumstances dictated.

The Shamar Rinpoches have had a hand in recognizing seven of the Karmapas and were often successors and teachers of the Karmapas—the relationship between the two has been characterized as being like father and son, or as brothers. The 5th Dalai Lama, for instance, affirmed the Karmapa and Shamarpa incarnations as having equal status, and in early texts the Shamarpa (Tibetan: ཞྭ་དམར་པ། Wylie: &quot;zhwa dmar pa&quot;, &quot;red-hatted one&quot;) is referred to as the &quot;Red Hat Karmapa&quot;. Upon his enthronement in 1964, the 14th Shamarpa was named by 16th Karmapa as his spiritual heir and was the senior-most lama of the lineage during the controversy. The Tai Situ Rinpoches and Gyaltsap Rinpoches have also had a close historical relationship with the Karmapas. The Tai Situ Rinpoches have identified — either independently or in conjunction with the Shamar or Gyaltsap Rinpoches — three of the Karmapa incarnations, and similarly, the Gyaltsap Rinpoches have helped identify four incarnations.

A prophecy was made by the 19th century Nyingma master, Chokgyur Lingpa, based a vision he had whereby Guru Rinpoche manifests as past and future Karmapas, and the minds of the 17th Karmapa and Tai Situ Rinpoche are &quot;inseparably one&quot; as they sit together under a &quot;verdant tree on a rocky mountain&quot;. While disputing the interpretation of the prophecy, the Shamarpa, while supporting his selection of Trinley Thaye Dorje, maintained it could be reinterpreted to correspond to the 16th Karmapa and the 11th Tai Situ Rinpoche.

In Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s Gelug school historically had a strong political and spiritual-leadership role, which was tempered by the autonomy of the three other schools of Tibetan Buddhism—the Kagyu school, the Nyingma school and the Sakya school. The Nyingma school has always been non-political. In 1992, after Ogyen Trinley Dorje was located and recognized, the search committee, then led by Tai Situ Rinpoche, requested that the Dalai Lama bestow the Buktham Rinpoche seal, or the Buktham Letter, on the recognized 17th Gyalwang Karmapa. The seal was made official on 30 June 1992. Supporters of Ogyen Trinley Dorje maintain that the 14th Dalai Lama has the spiritual authority to recognize an incarnation of the Karmapa. The Karmapa lineage is the oldest tulku lineage in Tibetan Buddhism, predating the Dalai Lama lineage by more than two centuries. Followers of the Karma Kagyu lineage historically have considered themselves independent of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s authority, and see the Karmapas as spiritually equal to the historical Buddha. Supporters of Trinley Thaye Dorje claim any previous involvement of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan government was merely a final stamp of approval following an individual monastery&#x27;s (or lama&#x27;s administration) independent decision.

Within the antireligious campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party is an ongoing directive to halt the recognition of high tulkus and control the naming of Dalai Lamas, Panchen Lamas, Karmapas, and Shamarpas, in order to gain spiritual and temporal control of Tibet and of Tibetan Buddhism. Official Beijing decrees were initiated in 1991, then revised as the State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5, to outlaw the recognition of tulkus and lamas without China&#x27;s state approvals. An ineffective lottery system was reported following the ban of the Shamarpas. In 1992, China tried another tactic which approved the 17th Karmapa&#x27;s enthronement and posited its plan to eventually replace the 14th Dalai Lama with the 17th Karmapa.

In the centuries following the inception of the system used to identify reincarnate lamas (beginning in the 13th century with the second Karmapa), the process became increasingly corrupted and politicized by those living outside monastic-ordination systems, as the process also led indirectly to sources of material wealth and power in Tibet. Highly respected teachers like the 14th Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche have bemoaned the practice as belonging to feudal times, and have advocated revamping the system in way that divorces the reincarnate teacher from administrative politics and allows them to distinguish themselves.

==History==
Soon after the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of the 16th Karmapa in 1981, a disagreement began brewing when head students of the Karmapa recounted opposing stories on what direction, and at whose feet, relics landed from the 16th Karmapa&#x27;s funeral pyre. Years passed with no obvious clues of where to find the next incarnation, and the controversy came to the forefront when Shamar Rinpoche broke from the group of regents, claiming Tai Situ Rinpoche was not following protocol.

===Initial search committee===

Following the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of the 16th Karmapa in 1981, a regency of the four highest remaining members of the Karma Kagyu lineage at that time was formed to locate his rebirth:

*The 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul: lead regent, third-ranking spiritual leader
*The 14th Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche: second-ranking spiritual leader
*The 12th Tai Situpa: fourth-ranking spiritual leader
*The 12th Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche: fifth-ranking spiritual leader

This regency was officially dissolved by 1984, but the four &quot;rinpoche&quot;s still referred to themselves as &quot;regents&quot; when the prediction letter was interpreted in 1992. As the collaborative group, they had the authority to recognize the next Karmapa. As years went by, the pressure to find the next incarnation of the Karmapa mounted.

===Discovery of prediction letter===

One central issue in the recognition of the 17th Karmapa was a prediction letter Tai Situ claimed was written by the 16th Karmapa. It indicated the parents, location, and year of the 17th Karmapa&#x27;s rebirth.

In January 1981, nine months before the 16th Karmapa&#x27;s &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot;, the 12th Tai Situpa maintained that the Karmapa gave him an amulet with a yellow-brocade cover, telling him, &quot;This is your protection amulet. In the future, it will confer great benefit.&quot; Although Tai Situpa wore the locket on a gold chain for about a year after the Karmapa&#x27;s death, he moved it to a side pocket, not realizing its significance or that it contained a message. Tai Situpa states that he followed an intuition to open the amulet and found in late 1990 the third prediction letter, inside an envelope marked &quot;Open in the Metal Horse Year&quot;.

===Shamar Rinpoche questions the letter&#x27;s authenticity===
Shamar Rinpoche questioned the authenticity of Tai Situ&#x27;s prediction letter presented in 1992. He requested a forensic examination to prove or disprove its age and authorship. Shamar Rinpoche stated the inner letter appeared to be older than its outer envelope, and claimed the handwriting and grammar did not match that of the 16th Karmapa. Tai Situ rejected the idea of a scientific evaluation.

===Recognizing the current Karmapa===
Among tulkus of the Karma Kagyu lineage, the 7th Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, the 9th Thrangu Rinpoche, the 7th Mingyur Rinpoche, and the 9th Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche hold Ogyen Trinley Dorje to be the 17th Karmapa. Trinley Thaye Dorje has been recognized by Shamar Rinpoche, Lama Jigme Rinpoche, Topga Yulgyal Rinpoche, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, Sherab Gyaltsen Rinpoche, Khenchen Rinpoche Drupon Trinley Paljor, and the Fourth Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche.

The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China officially recognized Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa in 1992. The PRC has continued to recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the Karmapa even after he departed Tibet and arrived in India in January 2000. Ogyen Trinley has been referred to as the &#x27;Beijing Karmapa&#x27;, due to the backing he receives from the government of the PRC. Trinley Thaye, meanwhile, is referred to as the &#x27;Delhi Karmapa&#x27;, due to his having the support of the government of India.

Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche said of his father, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, that &quot;As far as my father was concerned, they were both to be respected and perceived with pure appreciation.&quot;

===Court battle over Rumtek Monastery===

In 1982, Shamar Rinpoche and his cousin, Topga Yugyal, gained control of the estate at Rumtek Monastery a month after the 16th Karmapa&#x27;s passing. Three monasteries in Bhutan were sold and control was gained over the Karmapa Charitable Trust, organized in 1961 by the 16th Karmapa. Disagreements over the Shamarpa&#x27;s and Topga&#x27;s financial dealings began in 1988.

Ogyen Trinley Dorje&#x27;s followers maintain that the trust was established solely for the sake of seeing to the welfare of the Karmapa&#x27;s followers, providing funds for the maintenance of the monastery, and for the monks&#x27; medical fees. The administration of the monastery was the responsibility of the Tsurphu Labrang, which was organized as a legal entity for a related case.

===Ogyen Trinley escapes Tibet in 1999===
In late 1999, fourteen-year-old Ogyen Trinley Dorje decided that the restrictions placed on him by the PRC government at Tsurphu limited his ability to teach his disciples and receive teachings from lineage masters. He escaped over the Himalayas in the middle of winter, evading Chinese authorities and making his way through Nepal and on to Dharamsala, India, arriving on January 5, 2000.

===Ogyen Trinley Dorje meeting with Shamar Rinpoche in 2007===

Ogyen Trinley Dorje requested to meet Shamar Rinpoche, and asked to arrange a personal meeting with him. The two met in the Oberoi International Hotel in New Delhi on 9 January 2007.

Shamar Rinpoche had declined the first invitation in 2005, which was received by telephone call from Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, because to have accepted it &quot;at that time would invite unwarranted suspicions from the India government upon himself.&quot; According to Dawa Tsering, spokesperson for the administration of Shamar Rinpoche, &quot;He (Urgyen Trinley Dorje) was confident that this meeting would bring peace in the Kagyu School in general and thus help in flourishing Buddha Dharma. This meeting has created a basis to re-unite all in the Dharma Sangha. Therefore, such an initiative should be appreciated by all.&quot;

To underscore his willingness to be supportive, Shamar Rinpoche even provided the necessary help for Ogyen Trinley Dorje to obtain Indian government approval for a visit to the US, though at the same time maintained the stance that Trinley Thaye Dorje is the authentic Karmapa.&quot;

===Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche meet in 2010===
The Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche met on 13 August 2010 at the Dalai Lama&#x27;s residence to discuss ways of ending the controversy. The Shamarpa wrote, &quot;Although this matter is not easily resolved, since it is connected to the politics of China and India as well, with His Holiness Dalai Lama&#x27;s blessing and support I am confident that there will be an amicable solution, which will be beneficial for the Karma Kagyü lineage, as well as for Tibetan Buddhism in general.&quot;

===India accuses Ogyen Trinley Dorje of being a Chinese spy in 2011===
In February 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was accused of being a Chinese spy by government officials of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, allegations which the Karmapa denied. India&#x27;s intelligence report is said to have been lacking sufficient evidence. Money in the amount of one million dollars cash—some of the money in Chinese yuan—found in his monastery was later deemed to be legitimate donations.

===Ogyen Trinley Dorje&#x27;s travel restrictions lifted in 2011===
Ogyen Trinley Dorje&#x27;s ability to travel had been restricted since 2000. Narendra Modi&#x27;s government coming into power changed dynamics towards the Karmapa case. In March 2011, the Indian central government lifted some of the travel restrictions on Ogyen Trinley Dorje, allowing him to travel out of Dharamsala.

In May 2015, Karmapa travelled to the United Kingdom from India. By then, the Modi government lifted all travel restrictions placed by the previous government, except to Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim.

===Trinley Thaye Dorje weds in 2017===
On 29 March 2017, Trinley Thaye Dorje announced his plans to marry his friend, thirty-six-year-old Rinchen Yangzom, born in Bhutan. The announcement also mentioned he would no longer be performing ordination ceremonies, which are limited to holders of certain vows.

Trinley Thaye Dorje is not the first Karmapa to marry and have children. The 10th Karmapa fathered several sons and daughters. One of his sons, Norbu Zangpo, was recognized as the Sixth Tsurpu Gyeltsap. For his part, the 15th Karmapa composed a text on how to &quot;return one&#x27;s vows&quot; (cease to be a monk) properly. As a Tertön, he had numerous consorts; his children included Khyentsé Özer, who was recognised as the Second Jamgon Kongtrul, and Jamyang Rinpoché, an unrecognised Shamarpa.

==Reconciliation==
===Ogyen Trinley Dorje announces break from Dharma activities in 2018===
In March 2018, Ogyen Trinley Dorje published a video on his official YouTube channel. It was translated by official translator David Karma Choephel. In the video he sets the course for a temporary break from his activities. He proclaims his personal doubt of being as skilled as the previous Karmapas and asks the community to reconcile the division of the Karma Kagyu Lineage.

===The two Karmapas meet in 2018===
In early October 2018, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje met for a few days at a rural location in France. On October 11, they issued a joint statement that the two Karmapa candidates would work together to heal the divisions that split the Karma Kagyu lineage. 
This undertaking is critically important for the future of the Karma Kagyu lineage as well as for the future of Tibetan Buddhism and the benefit of all sentient beings. We therefore ask everyone within the Karma Kagyu community to join us in our efforts to strengthen and preserve our lineage. We view it as our collective responsibility to restore harmony to our tradition which is a lineage of wisdom and compassion.
===Joint prayers and statements===

On 20 October 2019, Thinley Thaye Dorje and Orgyen Thinley Dorje announced that they had together composed a long-life prayer for the 15th Shamarpa, and published its text in both Tibetan and an English translation.

On December 4, 2023, Thaye Dorje and Ogyen Trinley Dorje wrote a joint statement, that they would recognize the 15th Shamar Rinpoche together, as well as oversee his education, empowerments and instructions. They said the responsibility had fallen on both of them, that they had met several times over this issue, and they will not accept interference from any uninvolved parties.

<text>Cleomedes is a prominent lunar impact crater located in the northeast part of the visible Moon, to the north of Mare Crisium. It was named after Greek astronomer Cleomedes. It is surrounded by rough ground with multiple crater impacts. The irregular crater Tralles intrudes into the northwest rim. To the east is Delmotte. North of Cleomedes is a triple-crater formation with Burckhardt occupying the center.

The outer wall of Cleomedes is heavily worn and eroded, especially along the southern part of the wall. Cleomedes C lies across the south-southwest rim. The crater floor is nearly flat, with a small central peak to the north of the midpoint, forming a linear ridge toward the north-northeast. There are several notable craterlets on the floor, including a pair of overlapping craters just inside the northwest rim.

A rille named Rima Cleomedes crosses the northern floor, running southeast from the northwest rim. This rille branches in a fork after crossing the crater mid-line. Smaller clefts lie in the southeast part of the floor.

Cleomedes is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cleomedes.

<text>Carrick-on-Suir () is a town in County Tipperary, Ireland. It lies on both banks of the River Suir. The part on the north bank of the Suir lies in the civil parish of &quot;Carrick&quot;, in the historical barony of Iffa and Offa East. The part on the south bank lies in the civil parish of Kilmolerin in the barony of Upperthird, County Waterford.

==Location==
Carrick-on-Suir is situated in the south-eastern corner of County Tipperary, east of Clonmel and northwest of Waterford. Most of the town lies north of the river in the townland of &quot;Carrig Mór&quot; (big rock), with the remainder of the town on the opposite bank in the townland of &quot;Carrig Beg&quot; (small rock). The town is connected to Limerick and Waterford by the N24 road and a rail link. Carrick-on-Suir railway station opened on 15 April 1853. There are two trains a day to Waterford and two trains a day to Limerick Junction via Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary. There is no train service on Sundays. Several buses also run on this route. There is a recently refurbished riverside walk to Clonmel named the Blueway allowing visitors to walk or cycle along a scenic riverside path. This has recently been upgraded and replanted.

For the purposes of elections to Dáil Éireann, the town is part of the Tipperary constituency.

==History==
===Influence of the Butler family===
Carrick-on-Suir (originally called Carrig Mac Griffin) was formed on an island settlement upstream of Waterford. The town remained as an island until the 18th century when small rivers were diverted to form dry land north and west of the town. The earliest known records of a settlement are dated to 1247, when a charter of 3 fairs per year was awarded to Matthew Fitzgriffin, Lord of the manor of Carrick who was a member of the Cambro-Norman nobility.

By the early 14th century, Carrick Mac Griffin had become home to a prosperous Hiberno-Norman family – the Butlers. The first significant leader of the Butler clan, Edmond Butler (a.k.a. &quot;Edmund le Bottilier&quot;) was created Earl of Carrick in 1315. However, his son James did not inherit the title. Instead, 7 years after the death of his father, he was created Earl of Ormond in his own right. In 1447, Edmund MacRichard Butler founded the first bridge over the estuary at Carrick-on-Suir. Other notable members of the Butler clan were Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond (a.k.a. &quot;Black Tom&quot;) who built the Tudor Manor House extension to Ormonde Castle and James the 12th Earl and 1st Duke of Ormond, who founded the town&#x27;s woollen industry in 1670.

Edmond le Bottiler erected two large, heavily garrisoned castle keeps named the Plantagenet Castle on the north bank of the Suir, just east of what is now Main St. In the 15th century, a four towered castle was erected on the same site, two of which are now incorporated into the Elizabethan Manor House built by Black Tom Butler, c. 1560. The Manor House, where Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, one of the most celebrated of the 24 Irish Catholic Martyrs, was arrested in 1583, still stands today, having been extensively refurbished by the Irish State in the 1990s and is open to the public.

The town was also the inspiration for the 16th-century song, &quot;Cailín ó chois na Siúire mé&quot;, which is attested to as early as 1595 and mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; as &quot;Caleno custure me&quot;.

In 1649, the town was taken by English Parliamentarians during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. They captured Carrick by stealth after discovering an undefended gate as part of operations during the Siege of Waterford. Irish troops from Ulster under a Major Geoghegan tried to re-take Carrick but were eventually beaten off with the loss of over 500 killed.

In 1670 the Butlers set up a woollen industry in the town. By 1799, the town enjoyed some prosperity from the woollen industry, fishing, basket weaving and other river-related businesses – the population reached around 11,000 by this point. In that year, a barge capsized on the river near the bride, resulting in the deaths of around 91 people. Over the next 120 years however, the town suffered from high taxes and levies imposed by the British on the woollen industry, leading to high unemployment, poverty and emigration. The Great Famine also contributed greatly to the depopulation of the town.

===20th century===
With the coming of Independence and the Civil War, Carrick was initially occupied by the Anti-Treaty IRA until the town fell to the Free State army in 1922. By this stage, industrialisation had reached Carrick with the establishment of cotton factories and a local creamery. Most significant however for the economic development of the town was the arrival of the tanning industry in the 1930s, providing regular, dependable employment in the town for the first time. The local town council also embarked on building social housing projects in an effort to deal with appalling living conditions in the town for those economically disadvantaged. Despite these developments, economic opportunities were limited and poverty widespread – the town saw widespread emigration to Dublin, Britain and further afield especially during the long recessions of the 1940s and 1950s.

The closure of the Pollack &amp; Plunder tannery in 1985 caused immense hardship in the town, as a significant proportion of the population (Carrick&#x27;s population was roughly 4,000 by this point) were employed there or were dependent on someone who was. Carrick suffered a prolonged recession throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, again leading the population to drop due to emigration – a fate suffered by other small, rural Irish towns during the period. By the late-1990s, the economy of the town was on the upswing – unemployment had dropped, the SRAM bicycle component factory had opened as had numerous small businesses, and the population began to increase again for the first time in two centuries.

Carrick&#x27;s local infrastructure (in particular health and transport) still remains relatively undeveloped, due to its location on the border of 3 counties (and subsequent lack of political muscle both at county and national level), and the nearby larger towns of Clonmel and Waterford. As of 2006, no large manufacturing operation remains in the town – the SRAM plant closed in 2006, but Carrick continues to prosper economically. The population continues to increase, and the town expands with ongoing significant house building projects. The future of Carrick is likely to be that of a commuter town, servicing those working in Waterford and Clonmel – a role it has been performing for decades.

==Features and amenities==

There are two theatres in Carrick-on-Suir, the Brewery Lane Theatre and Arts Centre and the Strand Theatre. The Strand Theatre was opened in 1974 with actor and dramatist Micheál Mac Liammóir performing the opening ceremony. The 400-seat theatre was built by brothers Christy and Michael Butler. The theatre underwent significant renovations and was reopened in 2008.

The Brewery Lane Theatre and Arts Centre is located at the site of section of a brewery belonging to Richard Feehan. The brewery was later bought by James Sullivan, and was later bought by the Smithwick family in 1917. The building was bought and renovated by the Carrick-on-Suir Drama Group in the 1970s. The first performance in the theatre was Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s play &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; in 1980.

===River Suir===
Carrick-on-Suir is the tidal limit of the River Suir. Carrick has a 1-in-50-year flood defence system with quay walls ranging in height from 1.2m to 1.5m. Currently, the walls give protection from flooding caused by high tides. Flooding still occurs along the Glen/Mill River and Markievicz Terrace.

===Landmarks===
In 1447, a stone bridge was built, now known as the &quot;Old Bridge&quot;. A new, more modern bridge was completed in 1880 and was reconstructed widened in 1975. The bridge was later named after John Dillon after his imprisonment at Dundalk Prison in 1888. There is a cast-iron plaque on the bridge commemorating the naming of the bridge.

The Tholsel is a four-storey townhouse dating located at the West Gate. An octagonal lantern was erected and a clock tower with faces on three sides was added in 1784. A tholsel was a building used for local administration such as the collection of taxes and tolls.

A public park was created in the fair green in the 1860s. The fair green is a public open space used for play games and other outdoor pursuits.

Carrick-on-Suir Town Hall was completed in 1844. Originally constructed as a mechanics&#x27; institute, it was converted in a town hall in 1866. It is now used by Tipperary County Council for the provision of services to local residents.

===Churches===
There are three Catholic churches. The largest church in Carrick Mór is St Nicholas&#x27; church which was built in 1879, replacing an earlier church of the same name built in 1804. In Carrick Beg are the small St Molleran&#x27;s parish church (parts of which date back to the 13th century) and the larger Franciscan friary. The Franciscan order&#x27;s presence in Carrick dates back to 1336 with the granting of land for a friary by the 1st Earl of Ormond. However, the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII led to the closure of the friary. Just prior to the invasion of Ireland by Cromwell, the friars had returned for an 11-year period, before being shut down again and the friars having to go underground to avoid persecution. It was not until 1820 and the onset of Catholic emancipation that the friars were able to fully return and a new chapel was built. The friars served the local community until the lack of vocations to the order led to the order finally leaving Carrick-Beg in 2006.

Before the Irish War of Independence, the Church of Ireland community was relatively substantial. After returning to Ireland from Newfoundland, famous 18th century Bard Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara briefly converted to Protestantism and read aloud an Oath of Abjuration inside the Church of Ireland parish at Carrick-on-Suir. More recently, however, the former Protestant church on Main Street was abandoned until the late 1980s, but the church building and grounds have both been renovated and now serve as a heritage centre.

==Sport==
GAA is represented in the area by Carrick Davins (named after the first GAA president Maurice Davin), Carrick Swans and St. Molleran&#x27;s GAA clubs. The former two play in the Tipperary GAA area, and the latter in the Waterford GAA area. The 1904 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final was played in Carrick-on-Suir. The match was held on Maurice Davin&#x27;s land on 24 June 1906 between Cork and Kilkenny. Kilkenny won by a single point, 1–9 to 1–8.

Carrick United AFC is a junior (non-league, amateur) soccer team that plays in the Waterford &amp; District League. The club plays at Tom Drohan park, and has had some success in the Waterford &amp; District League, Munster Senior and Junior Cups and also in the FAI Junior Cup.

An amateur rugby team, Carrick-on-Suir RFC, plays in the Munster Junior League Division II. The club grounds are located east of the town in Tybroughney, County Kilkenny.

There is an 18-hole golf club, golf driving range, and swimming pool in the area. Castleview Lawn Tennis Club has four artificial grass courts, and Carrick-on Suir Handball and Racquetball Club is at Davin Park Indoor courts, Clonmel Road.

In cycling, 1988 Vuelta a España champion Sean Kelly and ten-time Grand Tour stage winner Sam Bennett are both from the town. The town is home to the Carrick Wheelers cycling club. Future Irish National Road Race champion Conor Dunne rode for the club in 2013, taking his first victory in a professional race on stage one of that year&#x27;s An Post Rás.

There are also two boxing clubs (Carrick-on-Suir Boxing Club and St. Nicholas Boxing Club) and a triathlon club.

1986 English Greyhound Derby champion Tico was born in the town.

==Clubs and societies==
The Carrick-on-Suir Musical Society (formed in 1943) is a musical and amateur operatic society. The Musical Society bought and refurbished the Strand Theatre on Main Street in 2003 for use by the Society. The Brewery Lane Drama Society (formed in 1955) performs several productions a year at their 75-person capacity theatre, which was formerly a malt house owned by Smithwicks.

The Irish Traction Group is based in Carrick-on-Suir, where restoration work is carried out on vintage diesel locomotives. Carrick-on-Suir also has a Republican Flute Band which plays at many Irish Republican and Sinn Féin events. Carrick Swim Club (Carrick Dippers) use the Sean Kelly Sports Centre as their base.

<text>Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old, is an operatic extravaganza that was the first collaboration between dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan. No musical score of &quot;Thespis&quot; was ever published, and most of the music has been lost. Gilbert and Sullivan went on to become the most famous and successful artistic partnership in Victorian England, creating a string of enduring comic opera hits, including &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

&quot;Thespis&quot; premièred in London at the Gaiety Theatre on 26 December 1871. Like many productions at that theatre, it was written in a broad, burlesque style, considerably different from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s later works. It was a success, for a Christmas entertainment of the time, and closed on 8 March 1872, after a run of 63 performances. It was advertised as &quot;An entirely original Grotesque Opera in Two Acts&quot;.

The story follows an acting troupe headed by Thespis, the legendary Greek father of the drama, who temporarily trade places with the gods on Mount Olympus, who have grown elderly and ignored. The actors turn out to be comically inept rulers. Having seen the ensuing mayhem down below, the angry gods return, sending the actors back to Earth as &quot;eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see&quot;. Gilbert would return to this theme twenty-five years later in his last opera with Sullivan, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot;, in which a theatre company temporarily replaces the ruler of a small country and decides to &quot;revive the classic memories of Athens at its best&quot;.

Seasonal works like &quot;Thespis&quot; were not normally expected to endure, and apart from a benefit performance shortly after the original staging, &quot;Thespis&quot; was not performed again during its creators&#x27; lifetimes. A renewed interest in the piece began in the 1950s, and numerous productions have been performed since, either with music taken from Sullivan&#x27;s other works, or with original music.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===

&quot;Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus&quot;

On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth. Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance.

Thespis&#x27;s acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority.

Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to &quot;mingle&quot; and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods&#x27; absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need.

===Act II===
&quot;The Same Scene, One Year Later, with the Ruins Restored&quot;

Under Thespis&#x27;s direction, Olympus has been restored to its former splendour, and the Thespians enjoy ambrosia and nectar. Thespis&#x27;s rule is very liberal, and he has advised his troupe not to &quot;be hampered by routine and red tape and precedent&quot;. The celestial assignments, however, have caused some difficulties, as the romantic entanglements of the actors in real life conflict with those of the gods that they are playing. Venus, played by Pretteia, is supposed to be married to Mars, but the actor playing Mars is her father. A possible solution is discovered in Venus having actually married Vulcan, but Vulcan is her grandfather. Sparkeion, who took on the role of Apollo, accompanies his wife, Nicemis, who plays Diana, on her nightly duties, so that the sun is up during the night.

Mercury informs Thespis that the substitute gods have received many complaints from mortals because some are not performing their functions, and others&#x27; ill-judged experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. For instance, Timidon, the replacement for Mars, is a pacifist and a coward; the substitute for Hymen refuses to marry anyone; and the ersatz Pluto is too tenderhearted to let anyone die. Daphne, who plays the muse Calliope, comes to Thespis and claims, based on a bowdlerised edition of the Greek myths, that Calliope was married to Apollo. She points out that Apollo, played by Sparkeion, is the brother of Diana (played by Sparkeion&#x27;s wife, Nicemis). Thespis decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again.

When the gods return, they are furious and tell Thespis that he has &quot;deranged the whole scheme of society&quot;. Thespis says that they should calm down, as the list of mortals&#x27; complaints is about to be read. The gods watch incognito as Mercury presents the complaints: The actors have ruined the weather; caused strife among the nations; and there is no wine, since Bacchus is a teetotaller. After listening to these grievances, the gods angrily shed their disguises. The actors beg to stay on Olympus, but Jupiter punishes them for their folly by sending them back to earth cursed as &quot;eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see&quot;.

==Background==

===Genesis===
 Impresario and author John Hollingshead, the lessee of London&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre since 1868, had produced a number of successful musical burlesques and operettas there. Indeed, Hollingshead &quot;boasted that he kept alight &#x27;the sacred lamp of burlesque.&#x27;&quot; Gilbert and Sullivan were each well acquainted with the Gaiety and its house artistes. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Robert the Devil&quot; (a burlesque of the opera &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;) had been on the programme on the theatre&#x27;s opening night on 21 December 1868, with Nellie Farren in the title role, and played successfully for over 100 nights. Constance Loseby and Annie Tremaine (both of whom had roles in &quot;Thespis&quot;) were also in the cast of &quot;Robert&quot;, and Arthur Sullivan was in the audience on that opening night as one of Hollingshead&#x27;s guests. It was a great success, &quot;received with a storm of approbation&quot;. Less successfully, Gilbert had also written a play for the theatre in 1869 called &quot;An Old Score&quot;. Hollingshead would later say that the piece was &quot;too true to nature&quot;. By late September or early October 1871, Gaiety programmes announced that &quot;The Christmas Operatic Extravaganza will be written by W. S. Gilbert, with original music by Arthur Sullivan.&quot; There would be prominent roles for the popular comedian J. L. Toole, as well as Farren, the theatre&#x27;s star &quot;principal boy&quot; in all of its burlesques.

How and when the pair came to collaborate on &quot;Thespis&quot; is uncertain. Gilbert was a logical choice for the assignment. With seven operas and plays premièring that year and over a dozen other burlesques, farces and extravaganzas under his belt, he was well known to London theatregoers as a comic dramatist. Sullivan, however, was at this point mainly known for his serious music. His completed music that year included the choral cantata &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot;, a suite of incidental music for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and numerous hymns, including &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;. He did have two comic operas to his credit, &quot;Cox and Box&quot; (1866) and &quot;The Contrabandista&quot; (1867), but the latter was four years in the past and had been unsuccessful. In September 1871, Sullivan had been engaged to conduct at The Royal National Opera, but it failed abruptly, leaving him unexpectedly without commitments. Hollingshead&#x27;s offer of a role to his brother, Fred Sullivan, may have encouraged him to write the music for &quot;Thespis&quot;.

The production &quot;aroused a great deal of interest and speculation&quot;. Ironically, it had &quot;probably the largest audience&quot; of any Gilbert and Sullivan première, as the Gaiety was the largest of the five London theatres at which their joint works premièred.

===Composition===
Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play &quot;On Guard&quot; had an unsuccessful run at the Court Theatre, opening on 28 October 1871, while his most successful play to date, &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot;, opened on 9 December, only a few days before rehearsals for &quot;Thespis&quot; were to begin. Sullivan, however, had more time on his hands after a Manchester production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, for which he supplied incidental music, had its première on 9 September.

Both Gilbert and Sullivan recalled that &quot;Thespis&quot; was written in some haste. Sullivan recalled, simply, that &quot;both music and &quot;libretto&quot; were very hurriedly written&quot;. In his 1883 autobiography, Gilbert wrote:
By 1902, Gilbert&#x27;s recollection of the time frame had expanded to five weeks:

Gilbert&#x27;s five-week estimate is &quot;in conflict with other apparently incontrovertible facts&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s nephew, Herbert Sullivan, wrote that the libretto was already in existence before his uncle became involved in the project: &quot;Gilbert showed [Hollingshead] the libretto of an operatic Extravaganza &quot;Thespis&quot;, and Hollingshead forthwith sent it to Sullivan to set.&quot; Gilbert generally sketched out his libretti some months in advance of a production but did not write a finished libretto until he had a firm commitment to produce it. At the very least, a &quot;rough draft of the plot&quot; must have existed by 30 October, in light of a letter on that date from Gilbert&#x27;s agent to R. M. Field of the Boston Museum Theatre, which reads:
Gilbert did, in fact, conclude an agreement with Field, and the first published libretto advised: &quot;Caution to American Pirates.—The Copyright of the Dialogue and Music of this Piece, for the United States and Canada, has been assigned to Mr. Field, of the Boston Museum, by agreement, dated 7th December, 1871.&quot; If Field mounted the work, however, the production has not been traced. Gilbert&#x27;s concern about American copyright pirates foreshadowed the difficulties he and Sullivan would later encounter with unauthorised &quot;pirated&quot; productions of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Mikado&quot; and their other popular works. In any case, the libretto was &quot;published and circulated&quot; in London in mid-December.

===Production===
With the piece set to open on 26 December, Gilbert first read the libretto to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing the central role of Thespis, did not return from a tour of the British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in &quot;Thespis&quot;. Lastly, &quot;Thespis&quot; was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, &quot;Dearer than Life&quot;, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.

Despite the short time available for rehearsals, Sullivan recalled that Gilbert insisted that the chorus play a major role, as it would do in their later Savoy operas:
==Reception==

===Opening night===
The première was under rehearsed, as several critics noted, and the work was also evidently in need of cutting: Gaiety management had advised that carriages should be called for 11:00 p.m., but &quot;Thespis&quot; was still playing past midnight. &quot;The Orchestra&quot; reported that &quot;scarcely one player... was more than &#x27;rough perfect&#x27; in his part.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that &quot;the acting, as well as the business, will want working up before it can be fairly criticized... the opera... was not ready&quot;. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that &quot;It is more satisfactory for many reasons to look upon the performance last evening as a full dress rehearsal... When &quot;Thespis&quot; ends at the orthodox Gaiety closing hour, and the opera has been energetically rehearsed, few happier entertainments will be found.&quot;

Some critics could not see past the production&#x27;s state of disarray. The &quot;Hornet&quot; captioned its review, &quot;Thespis; or, the Gods Grown Old and !&quot; The &quot;Morning Advertiser&quot; found it &quot;a dreary, tedious two-act rigmarole of a plot... grotesque without wit, and the music thin without liveliness... however, not entirely devoid of melody... The curtain falls before a yawning and weary audience.&quot; But others found much to admire in the work, despite the poor opening performance. The &quot;Illustrated Times&quot; wrote:

Clement Scott, writing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, had a mostly favourable reaction:
&quot;The Observer&quot; commented: &quot;[W]e have authors and musicians quite as talented as [the French]. ... The subject of &quot;Thespis&quot; is unquestionably funny. ... Mr. Arthur Sullivan has entered with heart into the spirit of Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s fun, he has brightened it up with the most fanciful and delightful music&quot;.

===Subsequent performances===
Many writers in the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that &quot;Thespis&quot; ran only a month and was considered a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before &quot;Thespis&quot; did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed by the end of March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of &quot;Thespis&quot; was extraordinary for the theatre.
As they would do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and alterations after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, &quot;I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain at the end of Act II.&quot; The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.

Reporting on the opera&#x27;s third night, a letter in the &quot;London Figaro&quot; stated: &quot;[N]ot a single hitch in the performance is now to be perceived, and ... the applause and evident delight of the audience from beginning to end ... fully endorses the opinion of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; critic&quot;. On 6 January 1872, the &quot;Penny Illustrated Paper&quot; commented that &quot;Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s Gaiety extravaganza grows in public favour and deservedly so&quot;. On 9 January, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported a visit by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh. By 27 January, the &quot;Illustrated Times&quot; noted that &quot;a chance playgoer will certainly not find a seat at the Gaiety... &quot;Thespis&quot; can, after all, boast the success which was predicted&quot;. &quot;Land and Water&quot; reported on 3 February that &quot;Thespis is now in capital working order.&quot;

Performances of &quot;Thespis&quot; were interrupted on 14 February 1872, Ash Wednesday, since London theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for the religious holiday. Instead, a &quot;miscellaneous entertainment&quot; was given at the Gaiety, consisting of ventriloquists, performing dogs and, coincidentally, a sketch parodying a penny reading by the young George Grossmith, who, several years later, became Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s principal comedian.

On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards wrote in the &quot;Musical World&quot;: &quot;In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a sacrifice of one to the other; but in &quot;Thespis&quot;... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece.&quot; Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when &quot;Thespis&quot; closed. The final performance during the authors&#x27; lifetimes was given less than two months later, on 27 April, at a matinée for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at &quot;inflated prices&quot;. The actress was a Gaiety favourite, &quot;not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure.&quot; Others recalled &quot;the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and piquant broken English&quot;. She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion, and her song in Act II, &quot;Little Maid of Arcadee&quot;, was the only one chosen for publication.

===Aftermath===

After the production of &quot;Thespis&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways, reuniting three years later, with Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte as their manager, to produce &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; in 1875. When that work was a surprise success, there were discussions of quickly reviving &quot;Thespis&quot; for the 1875 Christmas season. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan:
The proposed revival was mentioned in several more letters throughout the autumn of 1875, until on 23 November Gilbert wrote, &quot;I have heard no more about &quot;Thespis&quot;. It is astonishing how quickly these capitalists dry up under the magic influence of the words &#x27;cash down&#x27;.&quot; In 1895, with Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte struggling to rediscover success at the Savoy, he once again proposed a revival of &quot;Thespis&quot;, but the idea was not pursued. No mention of the whereabouts of the music of &quot;Thespis&quot; exists since 1897, and scholars have searched for it among many of the extant collections. Except for two songs and some ballet music, it is presumed lost.

The reasons why &quot;Thespis&quot; went unrevived are not known. Some commentators speculate that Sullivan used the music in his other operas. If this were true, then &quot;for this reason alone a revival would have become impossible&quot;. However, evidence that Sullivan did so has eluded discovery. Another possible explanation is that Gilbert and Sullivan came to regard &quot;Thespis&quot;, with its &quot;brazen girls in tights and short skirts&quot;, and broad burlesque-style humour, as &quot;the kind of work they wished to avoid&quot;. They later renounced &quot;travesti&quot; roles and revealing dresses on their actresses, and made publicly known their disapproval of them. In 1885, Hollingshead wrote to the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, &quot;Mr. Gilbert is somewhat severe on a style of burlesque which he did much to popularise in the old days before he invented what I may call burlesque in long clothes. … Mr Gilbert never objected to the dresses in &quot;Robert the Devil&quot; nor to the dresses in &quot;Thespis&quot;.&quot;

In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in the midst of a legal battle with the former directors of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: &quot;You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;... and [you] said, &#x27;They are yours, as our run is over...&#x27; Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of &quot;Thespis&quot; also at once. I am detaining the parts of &quot;Pinafore&quot;, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent &quot;you&quot; set.&quot;

===Modern productions===
After its last performance at the Gaiety in 1872, &quot;Thespis&quot; appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of &quot;Thespis&quot; between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan&#x27;s other works; the others use new music for all but the surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.

Theatre historian Terence Rees developed a version of the libretto that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto. Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert&#x27;s non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs. A score was supplied by Garth Morton, based on music from lesser-known Sullivan operas, and this version has been recorded. A version with an original score by Bruce Montgomery (other than the two Sullivan numbers) has been performed several times, including in 2000 at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. An original 1982 score by Kingsley Day has been used in several Chicago-area stagings. In 1996, another version with new music, by Quade Winter, was produced by the Ohio Light Opera.

In 2008, a Sullivan pastiche score (with some Offenbach added), arranged by Timothy Henty, was first used with Gilbert&#x27;s libretto adapted by Anthony Baker, at the Normansfield Theatre in Teddington, Middlesex, England, the first professional British production since 1872. This was performed several times subsequently, including at the 2014 International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. Also in 2008, an original score by Thomas Z. Shepard was first performed in concert by the Blue Hill Troupe in New York City and was finally given a fully staged amateur production in 2014.

==Assessment==

===More than the usual burlesque===

&quot;Thespis&quot; was an advance on the types of burlesques to which Gaiety audiences were accustomed. François Cellier recalled much later:
Several critics suggested that the piece may have been too sophisticated for its audience—or at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on Boxing Night. The &quot;Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season.&quot; Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: &quot;Sporting Life&quot; suggested that &quot;It may be that they looked for something less polished than Mr. Gilbert&#x27;s verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author&#x27;s humour. It may be, too, that &quot;Thespis&quot; was a little—I only say, just a little—&#x27;over their heads&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The Orchestra&quot; carried a similar sentiment: &quot;In fact, both music and idea were somewhat over the heads of the audience.&quot;

===Libretto===

The plot of &quot;Thespis&quot;, with its elderly gods tired of their life in Olympus, is similar to some of Offenbach&#x27;s operas, notably &quot;Orphée aux Enfers&quot; (&quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;). In &quot;Orphée&quot;, like &quot;Thespis&quot;, classical mythology, particularly the Olympian gods, are ruthlessly parodied. In &quot;Thespis&quot;, the gods swap places with actors and descend to Earth; in &quot;Orphée&quot;, the gods head to hell for a pleasant holiday away from boring perfection. Offenbach&#x27;s plot – for although Crémieux and Halévy wrote the libretto, the idea was Offenbach&#x27;s – places Orpheus, the great musician, in the centre; however, Gilbert&#x27;s plot focuses on Thespis, the Father of the Drama. While this may be a coincidence, it could also be seen as a response to Offenbach, as his plot places music at the centre of his operetta, but Gilbert&#x27;s elevates the dramatist.

The libretto has been praised by several biographers and historians. One said that &quot;The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch.&quot; Another found it &quot;a gay, sparkling libretto&quot;. Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that &quot;the book of &quot;Thespis&quot; is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays all the world loves... &quot;Thespis&quot; once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert&#x27;s artistry was hardly affected with the passing of the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas.&quot; They point out Mercury&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the celestial drudge&quot;, which anticipates Giuseppe&#x27;s &quot;Rising early in the morning&quot; in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, and find the &quot;real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom&quot; in the song about the former head of a railway company, &quot;I once knew a chap who discharged a function&quot;. Isaac Goldberg thought that &quot;&quot;Thespis&quot; looks forward far more often than it glances backward: It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871.&quot;

Goldberg wrote in 1929 that the libretto &quot;seems to have no specific ancestry... neither in his burlesques nor in his ballads... had Gilbert played with the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology.&quot; However, Gilbert did write a series of humorous sketches parodying the Greek myths, mainly the heroes of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, for the illustrated magazine &quot;Fun&quot; in 1864, and &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot;, which he produced just before &quot;Thespis&quot;, was a more serious treatment of Greek mythology. Jane W. Stedman points out that &quot;Thespis&quot; &quot;looks backward to French &quot;opéra bouffe&quot;&quot;, but it is &quot;fundamentally a Gilbertian invasion plot in which outsiders penetrate and affect a given society, often for the worse.&quot; She compares the theatrical company in &quot;Thespis&quot; to the politicians that remodel fairyland in Gilbert&#x27;s 1873 play &quot;The Happy Land&quot; and the Englishmen who reform the island nation of Utopia in &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893). Elements of &quot;Thespis&quot; also appear in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s last opera together, &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; (1896), where a theatre company replaces the ruler and decides to &quot;revive the classic memories of Athens at its best&quot;.

===The music===
Sullivan&#x27;s score generally came in for praise, though critics carped—as they would throughout his life—that theatrical scores were beneath his ability. In the &quot;Standard&quot;, A. E. T. Watson wrote:

Clement Scott in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found the opera &quot;not marred by ambitious music&quot;. But he added, &quot;Tuneful throughout, always pretty, frequently suggestive, the songs and dances are quite in character with the author&#x27;s design... Some of the numbers will certainly live, and the impression caused by the music as a whole is that it will have far more than a passing interest.&quot;

Many critics praised the originality of the title character&#x27;s song in the first act about the head of a railway company, which may have been a joke about the Duke of Sutherland, &quot;who was fond of running railway engines&quot;. Scott called the song a &quot;ludicrous ballad&quot;, but &quot;quite in the spirit of the well-known compositions of &#x27;Bab,&#x27; and, as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus, a hearty encore was inevitable. Though the ditty was long, the audience would have been well content to hear it all over again.&quot; The &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; found the orchestration &quot;very novel, including, as it does, the employment of a railway bell, a railway whistle, and some new instrument of music imitating the agreeable sound of a train in motion.&quot; Similarly &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted, &quot;The entire company join in the chorus, the music of which admirably expresses the whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed.&quot; &quot;The Era&quot; called it &quot;a screaming, whistling and shouting chorus [that] fairly brings down the house&quot;.

The similarity to French models was much commented upon. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; thought that &quot;the music in the piece itself is charming throughout, and promises for the first time a rival to Offenbach... &quot;Thespis&quot; is quite as good as &quot;Orphée aux Enfers.&quot;&quot; Another wrote:
The &quot;Morning Advertiser&quot; thought that &quot;There is an evident attempt to copy the creations of a foreign composer who is so popular at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses &quot;en bouffes.&quot;&quot; Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The &quot;Athenaeum&quot; wrote that the music &quot;was arranged and composed by Mr A. S. Sullivan (the first verb was not in the bills as it ought to have been)&quot;. One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, &quot;Here far away from all the world&quot;, was one of the &quot;single best items of the piece&quot;. In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication. The composer replied, &quot;&quot;Thespis&quot; is not published but if you like I will send you the Full Score of the Duet in question&quot;, but nothing came of it.

==Surviving music==
Only three musical passages from &quot;Thespis&quot; are known to survive: the ballad &quot;Little maid of Arcadee&quot;, the chorus &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;, and the ballet music. The fate of Sullivan&#x27;s score has long been a subject for speculation. In 1978, Isaac Asimov wrote a time travel story, &quot;Fair Exchange?&quot;, which focused on a character travelling back to 1871 to rescue the score to &quot;Thespis&quot; before Sullivan could destroy it. But Sullivan is not known to have destroyed it, and the ballet, at least, was still available to be reused in 1897.

===Little maid of Arcadee===

Sparkeion&#x27;s song in Act II, &quot;Little maid of Arcadee&quot;, was the only number from the opera to achieve contemporaneous publication. It was one of four numbers to be encored on the first night. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;With the public no doubt the musical gem will be a ballad called &#x27;Cousin Robin&#x27;—pathetic and tender words, with a dreamy and somewhat Gounodish air. So sweetly was this sung by Mdlle. Clary that another encore was inevitable.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; agreed that the song &quot;...will cause most delight on account of the quaint simplicity and tenderness of the words, the charming singing of Mdlle. Clary, and the really exquisite setting by Mr. Sullivan... This is a musical gem&quot;.
The song enjoyed long-standing popularity. Wyndham writes, &quot;Little maid of Arcadee&quot; was &quot;popular for a quarter of a century&quot;. Sullivan&#x27;s first biographer suggested that &quot;&quot;Thespis&quot; will be best remembered by the exquisite musical setting to the simple little Gilbertian ballad&quot;. Several later commentators write favourably of the song. Walbrook finds it &quot;one of the neatest of Gilbert&#x27;s ditties, packed with cynicism and slyness, expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness.&quot; Goldberg says that it is &quot;dainty, simple and quite in the vein of Gilbert&#x27;s words, to which, as in almost every later instance, Sullivan&#x27;s setting provides an original rhythmic piquancy.&quot; Fitz-Gerald considers it &quot;quite a forerunner of Gilbert at his easiest&quot;, while Dark and Gray call it &quot;a typically dainty Gilbertian love-song worthy to be compared to the best that he ever wrote.&quot; Jacobs dissents: &quot;As music it is as trivial as Sullivan ever wrote.&quot;

The separately published version had several significant wording differences from the theatrical version, owing to &quot;the contrast between the Gaiety Theatre&#x27;s suggestiveness and the prudery expected in the drawing room&quot;. In the drawing room version, the song&#x27;s little maid sat &quot;by&quot; Cousin Robin&#x27;s knee, not &quot;on&quot; it. Rather than &quot;weary of his lover&#x27;s play&quot;, he became &quot;fickle as the month of May&quot;. And rather than &quot;Cousin Richard came to woo&quot;, it was &quot;till another came to woo.&quot;

===Climbing over rocky mountain===

&quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; is the best known piece from &quot;Thespis&quot;, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s most successful operas, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from &quot;Thespis&quot; fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.

Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan&#x27;s autograph score for the later work, the first part of &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; is actually taken from a &quot;Thespis&quot; copyist score, with the &quot;Thespis&quot; words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a &quot;Thespis&quot; score to hand, if not for that purpose.

Some suggest that other music from &quot;Thespis&quot; could have been used in &quot;Pirates&quot;. Goldberg suggests that &quot;It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his &quot;Thespis&quot; music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.&quot; Reginald Allen says that &quot;it seems certain&quot; from its &quot;rhythmic structure&quot; that part of the Act I finale of &quot;Thespis&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys&quot; became the original Act II finale in &quot;Pirates&quot;, &quot;At length we are provided with unusual felicity&quot;, which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of &quot;Pirates&quot; was taken from &quot;Thespis&quot;. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;, neither author admitted to borrowing from &quot;Thespis&quot; for later operas.

===Ballet===

A five-movement ballet occurred somewhere in Act II, staged by W. H. Payne. A heading in the libretto, &quot;Chorus and Ballet&quot;, attaches it to the last section of the finale but does not indicate how it figured in the plot. Most press accounts placed it at about this point, although some placed it slightly earlier in the act. At some performances, the ballet was performed in Act I, but it was certainly in Act II on opening night, and it seems finally to have settled there.

In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett discovered the ballet from Act II of &quot;Thespis&quot;. Two of the five movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;, were found together with the surviving performance materials for Sullivan&#x27;s 1864 ballet, &quot;L&#x27;Île Enchantée&quot;. Another section was found in the material for his 1897 ballet, &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: a dragon costume, used nowhere in the libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the harp visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety&#x27;s orchestra. Movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in Sullivan&#x27;s other ballets, and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD.

Sullivan tended to re-use his ballet music. Of the five movements that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) is not known to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in &quot;L&#x27;Île Enchantée&quot;. Two of those, and one other, were eventually re-used in &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;. One was also used in his incidental music to &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of &quot;The Mikado&quot; in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the &quot;Thespis&quot; ballet was almost certainly the music that Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; he is unlikely to have written something original.

==Text==

The surviving libretto is not the version heard by audiences at the Gaiety Theatre. There are numerous discrepancies between the original libretto and what was described as happening on stage, and reviewers repeatedly quoted dialogue that has no equivalent in the published libretto. At least one song is missing, and an entire character, Venus, is mentioned in at least five reviews as stout, elderly, and heavily made-up; she does not appear in the libretto but was listed in the first night programme. Stage directions in the original are slip-shod: characters reappear without an entrance being noted, or enter twice in quick succession, without having exited. In addition, Sullivan told his mother that at least one song was cut after opening night, and there must certainly have been other cuts, given the undue length of the first performance. But the text of the libretto, as published, remained &quot;virtually unchanged&quot; between December 1871 and March 1872.

In a letter to Percy Strzelecki on 23 April 1890, Gilbert apologised for the condition of the libretto. He wrote, &quot;I was in the United States when it was published &amp; I had no opportunity of correcting proofs. This will explain the presence of innumerable typographical &amp; other errors.&quot; But several scholars conclude that Gilbert must have been remembering a trip the following year, as in the fall of 1871 it &quot;would have been impossible for Gilbert to travel to America and back in time for rehearsals of &quot;Thespis&quot;.&quot; Even after the first printing, there does not seem to have been any effort to correct the errors: There were four separate issues of the libretto between December and March, but no corrections were made.

Gilbert&#x27;s final disposition of the libretto came in 1911, when it was included in the fourth volume of his &quot;Original Plays&quot;. However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few spelling mistakes.

==Musical numbers==
The music is known to survive for numbers shown in bold; a ballet also survives, but its location in the order of musical numbers is uncertain. Reviews of the opera hint at three additional numbers not in the libretto, but as their names and exact locations are unknown, they are not listed.

;Act I

*Act II Finale: &quot;We can&#x27;t stand this&quot; (Ensemble)

==Recordings==
As most of the music to &quot;Thespis&quot; is lost, there is no complete recording of the original score. The ballet, as reconstructed by Spencer and Tillett, has been issued twice on CD:

*Pryce-Jones, John, conductor (1991). &quot;Thespis – Ballet in Act 2&quot;. On &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (CD). That&#x27;s Entertainment Records CDTER2 1188.

A recording of the Rees/Morton version of &quot;Thespis&quot; was issued on LP records, which included the original &quot;Little maid of Arcadee&quot; and &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;: Spencer, Roderick, conductor (1972). &quot;Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old&quot;. Fulham Light Operatic Society. Rare Recorded Editions SRRE 132/3.

&quot;Little maid of Arcadee&quot; has been included in two Sullivan anthologies:
*Adams, Donald, singer (1971, LP). &quot;Donald Adams Sings Sullivan and Gilbert&quot;, Brookledge Classics SM-GS-1.
*Benton, Jeffrey, singer (1992, cassette). &quot;If Doughty Deeds&quot;, Symposium 1124.
