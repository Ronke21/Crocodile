<text>Quicksilver is a utility app for macOS. Originally developed as proprietary freeware by Nicholas Jitkoff of Blacktree, Inc., it is now an open-source project hosted on GitHub.

Quicksilver is essentially a graphical shell for the macOS operating system, allowing users to use the keyboard to rapidly perform tasks such as launching other apps, manipulating files, or sending e-mail. Many of its features have been integrated into the modern macOS system feature, Spotlight. It is similar to the macOS applications LaunchBar and Alfred, but uses a different interaction paradigm. Because of its flexible interface and extensibility, Quicksilver has been called one of the top productivity applications on the Mac.

==Features==

===Interface===
Invoked with a keyboard shortcut, Quicksilver has three panes, into which the user can enter an object, an action, and an optional attribute—analogous to creating a sentence with a subject, verb, and object.

Quicksilver is a background application that runs while the operating system is running, maintaining a &quot;catalog&quot; of files and objects on the user&#x27;s computer. By applying incremental search as the user types, Quicksilver predicts the filename or action typed by the user and automatically selects the object. Quicksilver uses a priority system based on prior usage to &quot;learn&quot; the user&#x27;s habits, ultimately requiring only a few letters for the most commonly selected objects.

===Extensibility===

====Triggers====
Quicksilver allows users to define &quot;triggers,&quot; which perform a specific command (direct object/action/indirect object combination) whenever a customizable keyboard shortcut is pressed. For instance, if a command opening the Documents folder is bound to the key, this hotkey would trigger that action regardless of what application the user is currently in.

====Plug-ins====
Quicksilver has a built-in plug-in architecture, allowing the user to choose and install plug-ins providing integration with a specific program, interface, or new feature. For example, plug-ins exist for sending email via Mail without opening the application or manipulating images via text commands.

====Flexibility====
Because shell scripts and AppleScripts can be stored in the catalog, any function which can be performed with a script can be tied to Quicksilver through either the command window or triggers. Because most Apple-native applications have extensive scripting libraries, many common tasks can easily be performed from Quicksilver. For instance, iTunes can be told to play or pause, increase or decrease the current track&#x27;s rating, or skip to the previous or next track.

There are various visual interfaces for Quicksilver, Constellation Menus supporting mouse gestures, and a Notification Hub which supports Growl.

===Alchemy===

Experimental trunk builds of Quicksilver, known as &quot;Alchemy&quot;, have many major changes.
* Triggers are moving to a separate product, called &quot;Catalyst&quot;
* All the little frameworks are being joined into one big one called &quot;Crucible&quot;. This includes extensions and core functionality that most applications and plugins will use. This is currently called &quot;QSBase.framework&quot;
* The preferences will be greatly simplified. There will be Extras-style advanced preferences for the fiddly options.
* Plugins are going to be hidden from most users, they&#x27;ll activate themselves automatically or be installable from the web
* β5X Plugins are incompatible.

These builds have four major components: &quot;Crucible&quot;, a framework with extension to AppKit and tools common to all Alchemy applications; &quot;elements&quot;, a framework supporting the plugin architecture; &quot;quicksilver&quot;, a command window driven launcher; and &quot;catalyst&quot;, which triggers a preference pane.

==History==

Nicholas Jitkoff started development of Quicksilver in 2003. He released several versions to the public until 2006 and maintained an internet forum for the tool from the beginning.

On October 30, 2007, the source code for Quicksilver was made available via Google Code.
In November 2009, development shifted to using GitHub.
Quicksilver is now developed by a team of volunteers known collectively as &quot;QSApp&quot;.

At the end of 2010, the new website QSApp.com was launched, with the aim of unifying and collating all of Quicksilver&#x27;s fragmented builds, plugins and support groups. Since its launch, the site has included a new Plugins Repository, Wiki and Downloads section. After several months of development, the milestone version β59 was released. On March 25, 2013, Quicksilver v1.0 was released after ten years of beta testing. On March 25, 2022, Quicksilver v2.0 was released, which runs natively on Apple Silicon (M1) Macs.

Quicksilver&#x27;s icon is based on the alchemical symbol for mercury, &quot;quicksilver&quot; being an archaic name for the element.

<doc id="978404" wikidata="Q3021798" url="?curid=978404" title="Government Center station (MBTA)">
<text>Government Center station is an MBTA subway station in Boston, Massachusetts. It is located at the intersection of Tremont, Court and Cambridge Streets in the Government Center area. It is a transfer point between the light rail Green Line and the rapid transit Blue Line. With the Green Line platform having opened in 1898, the station is the third-oldest operating subway station (and the second-oldest of the quartet of &quot;hub stations&quot;) in the MBTA system; only Park Street and Boylston are older. The station previously served Scollay Square before its demolition for the creation of Boston City Hall Plaza.

The station was closed on March 22, 2014 for a major renovation, which included retrofitting the station for accessibility and building a new glass headhouse on City Hall Plaza. The new fully accessible station was reopened on March 21, 2016.

==History==

===Scollay Square===

As the first horsecar lines were built in the late 1850s, the Scollay Building in Scollay Square became the transfer point between the various lines. The Metropolitan Railroad, the largest of the horsecar systems, used the Tremont House hotel a block to the south of Scollay Square as a terminus for many routes.

The northern section of the Tremont Street Subway opened on September 3, 1898, with a station at Scollay Square. The station had an unusual platform design. The three-sided main platform served northbound and southbound through tracks plus the Brattle Loop track, one of two turnback points (along with Adams Square) for streetcars entering the subway from the north; a side platform also served the loop Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) streetcars from Everett, Medford, and Malden (which formerly ran to Scollay Square on the surface) used Brattle Loop, as did cars from Lynn and Boston Railroad and its successors. The last of those, the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, used the loop until 1935.

Scollay Square and Adams Square had similar baroque headhouses with four-sided clock towers. Unlike Adams Square, the Scollay Square headhouse had its entrance at one end of the structure. A small exit structure was located to the north, while the Brattle Loop used a separate entrance built into a building at Court Street and Brattle Street. The headhouses of the Tremont were sharply criticized as &quot;pretentiously monumental&quot;, with the Scollay Square headhouse compared to &quot;an enlarged soda fountain&quot;. Later stations on the East Boston Tunnel and Washington Street Tunnel incorporated this criticism into their more modest headhouses.

On June 10, 1901, Main Line Elevated trains began using the through tracks through the Tremont Street Subway, while streetcars continued using the Brattle Loop. The main platform was divided into separate sections for northbound and southbound elevated trains, each with separate staircases and ticket takers, with sliding platform sections to meet the high-level doors on the El cars. Passages under the Brattle Loop were built from each side to the Brattle Loop platform, which had its own staircases and ticket takers for streetcars. On July 9, 1904, streetcar passengers began paying fares to the streetcar conductors and the streetcar ticket office was repurposed for southbound El passengers.

===Court Street===

On December 30, 1904, the East Boston Tunnel opened for streetcars from Maverick Square in East Boston to a one-track stub-end terminal at Court Street next to Scollay Square. A passageway was built connecting the two stations. A bronze statue of John Winthrop was relocated from Scollay Square to the Back Bay in 1903 to make room for the exit stairs from the station. Erected in 1880, the statue had already been moved in 1898 to make room for the first headhouse.

The stub-end track at Court Street was normally restricted to one streetcar at a time; however, two were commonly allowed during peak periods. On October 6, 1906, a conductor was crushed to death between two streetcars while preparing his trolley pole for the return trip - the second such accident at the station. In addition to these incidents, the stub-end terminal was operationally inefficient, which prompted the need for a replacement.

===Return to streetcar use===
On November 30, 1908, Elevated trains moved into the parallel Washington Street Tunnel and the Tremont Street Subway through tracks returned to streetcar operations. The separated platform areas were kept; the through tracks offered a free transfer to East Boston Tunnel streetcars (plus a small toll for use of the tunnel, separate from normal BERy fares), while the Brattle Loop platform was kept separate for &quot;foreign&quot; (non-BERy) cars on a separate fare system.
===Scollay Under===

In November 1912, the Boston Transit Commission began an extension of the East Boston Tunnel west to Bowdoin. Court Street station was abandoned on November 15, 1914; a passageway was opened to connect Scollay Square station with Devonshire, which temporarily served as the terminal. The floor of the station was removed and the tunnel angled down through the former station to allow for the extended tunnel to proceed under the existing Scollay Square station. The upper part of the former station was later converted to storage space.

Scollay Under opened on March 13, 1916, with streetcars looping empty around the Bowdoin loop. It had an island platform with staircases to the existing Scollay station. The 1898-built platform was extended during the project to accommodate expected loads of transferring passengers. Bowdoin station opened on March 18. An Orient Heights–Central Square, Cambridge through service was started, while several Cambridge streetcar lines entered the new tunnel and terminated on a pocket track at Scollay Under.

The northbound (Cornhill Street) entrance was closed on November 24, 1917, forcing all passengers to use the southbound Tremont Row entrance. In 1927, the original headhouse was replaced with a simple staircase to improve sightlines for auto drivers. On April 18, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel including Scollay Under was converted from low-platform streetcars to high-platform third-rail-powered rapid transit. A portion of the low streetcar platform remained east of the new high platform.

The station was further renovated in 1928 with new lights, and improved fare collection equipment. Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway service to Brattle Loop ended on January 13, 1935, though some BERy streetcars continued to use it. The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) replaced the BERy in 1947 and continued to reduce streetcar services. The last Brattle Loop service was discontinued in 1952. The northbound platform was extended over the loop in 1954 to allow two 3-car trains of PCC streetcars to board simultaneously.
===Government Center===
Boston City Hall Plaza replaced Scollay Square in the early 1960s. Scollay Square station was wholly renovated, and the northbound tunnel was realigned to accommodate the foundation of Boston City Hall. The work drastically altered the shape of Brattle Loop and provided a new northbound-to-southbound turnback loop. The stairways to the lower level were relocated, and a fare lobby was built in a low brick structure at the surface. The 1963-built headhouse was often described as resembling a bunker or a cave, even by MBTA management. Government Center station was dedicated on October 28, 1963, though the new loop was not activated until November 18, 1964, when the Commonwealth Avenue line was extended from Park Street to Government Center. Despite the new name, several tiles mosaics reading &quot;Scollay Under&quot; and &quot;S&quot; were still extant and gradually uncovered over the years.

On August 26, 1965, as part of a wholesale rebranding of the system, the MBTA (formed in 1964 to replace the MTA) designated the remaining streetcar routes as the Green Line and the East Boston Tunnel line as the Blue Line. In 1968-69, a &quot;Phase I&quot; modernization added false ceilings, fluorescent lights, and other aesthetic upgrades.

In the late 1970s, Mary Beams - an artist at Harvard&#x27;s Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts - painted 19 murals which were placed along the wall behind the Brattle Loop. Although intended to be temporary, they received protective covers in the late 1980s and remained in good condition until the 2014 closure.

On February 11, 1983, the Green Line E branch was shut down by snow for several days; a Government Center-Lechmere shuttle ran in its stead - the first use of the Brattle Loop in three decades. Even after the E branch resumed operations several days later, the shuttle service ran until June 21, 1997. Since, the loop was used only for temporary car storage, largely during events at Boston Garden (later TD Garden) and after the morning peak.
===Renovation===


In 1990, the state agreed to a number of transit expansion and renovation projects to settle a lawsuit from the Conservation Law Foundation over the environmental impacts of the Big Dig. Due to its cost, complexity, and the need to completely shut down a major transfer station, Government Center was the last of 80 key stations to be upgraded for accessibility. Original plans in the 1990s called for the project to add two new entrances to the station, using the former west entrance to the Blue Line level and the former Brattle Loop entrance to the Green Line level. The Blue Line entrance would be close to Bowdoin station, allowing it to be closed.

The additional Green Line entrance was cut during preliminary design, but the Blue Line entrance was kept; until at least 2011, the MBTA still planned to close Bowdoin after Government Center was renovated. However, by 2013, the MBTA decided not to construct the planned west entrance at Government Center, and to instead build only a less-expensive emergency exit.

The main construction contract was awarded to Barletta Heavy Division in July 2013, and site preparation began in mid-November 2013. On March 22, 2014, Government Center station closed for two years for the reconstruction, which included new elevators, station entrance and lobbies, emergency exit-only structure on Cambridge Street between Court and Sudbury Street, escalators, LED signage, expanded fare collection area, upgraded back-up electrical power supply, improved interior finishes, station lighting, mechanical systems, and public address system. The abandoned side platform was almost completely tiled over. Additional vendor retail space was provided on both Green Line and Blue Line platforms. The platform levels feature terrazzo flooring color-coded to the lines.

During Government Center station&#x27;s closure, Green Line trains passed through but did not stop at the station. For the duration of the closure, the B branch was cut back to Park Street (after the reopening of Government Center station, this would later be modified to keeping it at as the terminus permanently for five more years), while the D branch was cut to Park Street at rush hours and North Station at other times. The &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; branches kept their usual terminals. Bowdoin station was kept open for all MBTA operating hours (for the first time since 1981) during the closure. A shuttle bus, the 608 Haymarket via Government Center Loop route, operated in a loop from Haymarket station via State Street station, Government Center station, and Bowdoin station.

During the first two months of renovations, two additional Scollay Under tile signs were uncovered on the Blue Line level. After the first sign was discovered in April, the MBTA announced that it would be restored and placed in the renovated station, similar to previously found mosaics at South Station and Arlington. In total, five &#x27;Scollay Under&#x27;, one &#x27;Scollay&#x27;, and two single-letter mosaics were restored. An original faregate, ticket booth, and ceiling arches were also found. The 1970s Mary Beams murals - made of house paint on plywood - did not meet fire code for installation in the rebuilt station. Instead, they were sold at auction in October 2015, with the proceeds going to an enamel commemorative panel and new artworks placed in the new station.

By September 2014, demolition was completed and the steel frame of the new glass headhouse had been erected. At that point, the project was on schedule and on budget. In July 2015 the MBTA announced that the project was still on schedule for a Spring 2016 reopening. In August 2015, the MBTA revealed that the glass used on the headhouse was defective due to poor workmanship, with failed seals between the double-paned glass causing fogging. The glass was replaced at the contractor&#x27;s expense and did not affect the project&#x27;s schedule.

On February 2, 2016, the MBTA announced that the station would reopen on March 26, 2016 and that the project was within its budget. On February 19, the MBTA tested multicolored LED lights to illuminate the glass headhouse. After several unpublicized notices, the MBTA announced on March 9 that the station would open on March 21 instead, with a ceremony at 11:45am and full opening an hour later. On the radio command of Governor Charlie Baker, service to the station resumed at 12:43pm.

Design and engineering for the station cost $25 million; the MBTA estimated the construction cost would be $91 million. The primary construction contract was for $82 million, and total construction cost was $88 million. The new station headhouse design was heavily criticized in a monthly architectural review by the social commentator and critic James Howard Kunstler. The headhouse has also been criticized for blocking the view of Old North Church from Tremont Street.

Since the loop opened in 1964, Government Center has been a terminus for scheduled service on one or more branches except for the 2014–2016 closure, 1980–1982, and a short period in 1967. It was the terminus for D branch service from 2016 to October 24, 2021, when it became instead the terminus for B and C branch service as part of preparations for the 2022 opening of the Green Line Extension. Government Center was the northern terminus of the Green Line from August 22 to September 18, 2022; the closure of the northern section allowed for final integration of the Medford Branch, elimination of a speed restriction on the Lechmere Viaduct, demolition of the Government Center Garage, and other work.

<doc id="978407" wikidata="Q1421674" url="?curid=978407" title="Vehicle registration plates of Indonesia">
<text>Motorized vehicles in Indonesia are required to have registration plates, which must be displayed both at the front and back of the vehicles. The issuing of number plates is regulated and administered by SAMSAT (), which is a collaboration between the Indonesian National Police, provincial offices of regional revenue, and the national mandatory vehicle insurance operator Jasa Raharja.

== Registration area codes ==
The lettering convention denoting the area of registration is a legacy of the Dutch colonial era and does not reflect the current regional divisions of the country into provinces. They follow the old system of Dutch &quot;Karesidenan&quot; or residencies lettering systems, which were adopted in the 1920s, and the Territorial Police system which was abolished in 2010.

The list of area codes are:

Several areas provide license plates for non-motorized transport vehicles. In Yogyakarta, &#x27; is used for rickshaws. A white-on-blue license plate with area code &#x27; is issued for rickshaws operating in the city of Surabaya. In Banjarmasin, rickshaws operating in the city are issued with plate using a unique format, .

=== Defunct area codes ===
There were some area codes that are no longer in use anymore. These include:
* – ex Borneo Residency, Western region
* – East Timor
* – Papua, prior to 2016.

== History ==
=== Colonial era ===
Vehicle registration plates were first introduced in the Dutch East Indies in 1900. The early format included regional codes such as &#x27; for Cirebon, &#x27; for Surabaya, and &#x27; for the eastern coast of Sumatra; and registration numbers with no official standards. Plates were not always installed at the front and the rear of the vehicle; some owners affixed the plates on the side of the vehicle. For international purposes, the Government of the Dutch East Indies introduced the code &#x27; for government vehicles. plates were elliptical and the registration numbers were placed below on a rectangular plate.

A more-structured system was introduced in 1917 with the implementation of regulations regarding the content of applications for number and driving licenses, the specification of numbers and letters, the models of number and driving licenses, the establishment of registers of holders of the licenses and the publication of the contents of the registers. The regulation obliged vehicle owners to register their vehicles. The Karesidenan-based system was first implemented on Java and afterwards elsewhere in the colony. The alphabetical codes were:

* : Banten
* : Batavia (now Greater Jakarta)
* : Preanger Regencies (now Greater Bandung)
* : Cirebon
* : Pekalongan
* : Semarang
* : Rembang
* : Surabaya
* : Madura
* : Pasuruan, Malang
* : Besuki
* : Banyumas
* : Kedu
* : Special Region of Yogyakarta
* : Surakarta (Sragen Regency, Klaten Regency, Karanganyar Regency, Boyolali Regency)
* : Madiun (Ngawi Regency, Ponorogo Regency, Magetan Regency, Pacitan Regency)
* : Kediri (Tulungagung Regency, Blitar, Trenggalek Regency, Nganjuk Regency)
* : Western coast of Sumatra
* : Tapanuli
* : Bengkulu
* : Lampung
* : Palembang
* : Jambi
* : East Sumatra (now Greater Medan)
* : Aceh
* : Riau
* : Bangka
* : Riau Islands
* : West Kalimantan
* : South Kalimantan and East Kalimantan
* : Manado
* : Sulawesi
* : Ambon
* : Ternate
* : Timor
* : Bali and Lombok
Until the 1920s, regional codes were added along with the Karesidenan regional expansion. For example, Bogor used the code &#x27;, Bojonegoro used the code &#x27;, and Western Papua used the code .

=== Post-colonial era ===

==== 1980s ====
The early format of registration plates remained in use after Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945. At the beginning of the 1980s, plates with four-digit numbers separated by a dot at the bottom that denote the month and year of expiry (e.g. ) was introduced. Vehicle owners must pay a tax to renew the plate every five years. The typefaces are embossed. There were two variations of design during the New Order; the expiry date would be placed above or below the registration numbers.

==== 21st century ====
Along with the increase of motorized vehicles in Indonesia, the technical design and specification of vehicle registration plates began to be regulated by the &quot;Direktorat Lalu Lintas Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia/Ditlantas Polri&quot; (Traffic Directorate) of the Indonesian National Police. The size of the license plates during the 2000s was (four wheel vehicles or more) or (two or three wheel vehicles) with wide alphabets and a stripe that separates the registration numbers and expiry date. In the lower left and upper right corners is the Traffic Police symbol, and at the lower-right and upper-left corners is a &quot;DIRLANTAS POLRI&quot; sign as a security feature and proof of the originality of the license plate.

In April 2011, the design of the license plate was redesigned. The new plates are longer to accommodate more characters and the typeface is slimmer. The Traffic Corps of the Indonesian National Police (Korps Lalu Lintas Kepolisian Negara Republik Indonesia/Korlantas Polri) introduced their more-complete coat of arms, with shield and ribbon with the letter &quot;Dharmakerta Marga Raksyaka&quot;. The phrase &quot;DITLANTAS&quot; became &quot;KORLANTAS&quot;. The license plates are made from -thick aluminium with edge lines with the same color as the numbers. The size of the plate for two-or-three-wheeled vehicles now is , while for four-or-more-wheeled vehicles they are .

Since June 2022, The Traffic Corps of the Indonesian National Police changed the color scheme for personal and rental vehicles from black plates with white letters to white plates with black letters. The new color scheme was implemented to ease the detection of motoring offenses with traffic enforcement cameras. To increase the effectivity of the new color scheme, FE-Schrift typeface was first implemented for regular personal four-wheel plates only since November 2022. Besides that, commercial/public transport (black on yellow) and government-owned (white on red) vehicle plates began to use FE-Schrift at the same time.

== Registration plate design convention ==
=== Size and formating ===
Indonesian vehicle registration plates for four-wheel vehicles are approximately and plates for two-or-three-wheel vehicles are approximately 275 mm × 115 mm. All plates are constructed from stamped sheet metal. With some exceptions, plates use the following format: &#x27; where &quot;L&quot; are letters of the Latin alphabet, and &quot;N&quot; numbers from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot; (the first number is never a &quot;0&quot;). The first single-or-double-letter prefixes denote the area of registration. This is followed by number between 1 and 9999 without leading zeroes. This is then followed by one or two letters although they may be optional. For example: &#x27; is a vehicle registered in East Jakarta city; it begins with B. A smaller, four-digit number separated by dot is located at the top (old format, with horizontal line as divider) or bottom (newer format, commonly without divider) of the plate with following format: &#x27; denoting the month and year of the plate&#x27;s expiry (e.g. &#x27; means until January 2028). The owner must pay a tax to renew it every five years.

=== Color scheme ===

Vehicles in Indonesia are coded based on their classes and uses. These are:
==== Electric vehicles ====
The Indonesian National Police has set a special license plate for electric vehicles with additional blue trim at the expiry date row in accordance with the regulations in the Decree of the Head of the Traffic Corps of the Indonesian National Police in 2020. However, when personal fossil-fueled vehicle plates have changed the color scheme, personal EV plates are still using the old one (white on black) with blue trim, added with the implementation of FE-Schrift since November 2022.
==== Temporary registration plates ====

Temporary registration plates currently have two formats, namely:

* Red on white: Vehicles that have not been registered yet, or for new cars that have no owners yet or no legal identification. This format is widely used nationally for all vehicle types.
* Black on white with special suffix: This format is exclusively used within the Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police jurisdiction (which uses the registration code ) and commonly used for new car owners that haven&#x27;t got the permanent registration yet. It looks similar with the permanent personal vehicle plates, but added with the &#x27; suffix, which is an abbreviation of &quot;Sifat Sementara&quot; (temporary use). In January 2024, newer suffixes were introduced, such as , , , , and . Temporary plates with this format are only valid for 30 days. For example: &#x27;, , and .

==== Former color scheme ====
=== Special code examples ===
==== Vehicle category (Jakarta only) ====
In Jakarta, these codes are applied based on vehicle categories. These include:
* – Code for Double Cabin Pickups
* &#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27; – Code for sedans
* &#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27; – Code for pickups
* – Code for trucks
* &#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/ – Code for minibuses
* &#x27;/&#x27; – Code for ambulances
* &#x27;/&#x27;/ – Code for SUVs
* &#x27;/&#x27; – Code for government staff
* &#x27;/&#x27; – Code for taxis
* &#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/&#x27;/ – Code for Minibuses
For example, &#x27; indicates that the vehicle is a pickup, while &#x27; indicates that the vehicle is a minibus.

==== State officials ====

A separate format exists for private vehicles belonging to government, military or police officials. Because most of these agencies are based in Jakarta, vehicles belonging to state officials use the &#x27; suffix, along with the four numbers that are assigned to the vehicle. The sub-area suffix is replaced with &#x27; suffix code, indicating the vehicle belongs to a state official, followed by another letter that indicates the corresponding agency or institution of the state official.

* - Vehicle registration code intended for civil officials.
** &#x27;, &#x27;, and suffixes are intended for civil officials under the Echelon 2 rank role.
* - Vehicle registration code intended for Indonesian National Armed Forces
* - Vehicle registration code intended for Indonesian Army officials.
* - Vehicle registration code intended for Indonesian Navy officials.
* - Vehicle registration code intended for Indonesian Air Force officials.
* - Vehicle registration code intended for Indonesian National Police officials.

For example, &#x27; indicates that the vehicle belongs to a civilian official, whilst &#x27; indicates that the vehicle belongs to a police official.

On 27 January 2023, the Traffic Corps of the Indonesian National Police announced that special &#x27; plates would be discontinued in October 2023, due to often being misused by numbers of people. By July 2023, the special &#x27; plates has been replaced by plates.

== Special plate designs ==
=== Military and police vehicles ===
Military and police vehicles have their own colors and alpha-numeric conventions, including their insignia and/or the rank of the officer owning the vehicle, especially for high-ranking officers.

Army-personnel vehicles are yellow on green background, plus a yellow star on the top. Navy-personnel plate is yellow on light blue, plus a yellow anchor. Air Force-personnel plate is yellow on dark blue, plus a red and white air force roundel. Police plate is yellow on black. Personnel in Armed Forces Headquarters uses yellow numbers on red background plates. Slightly similar, Ministry of Defense vehicles also uses yellow on red plates, only replacing Armed Forces&#x27; insignia with the Ministry&#x27;s insignia. This is also being implemented on other military vehicles, such as motorcycles, jeeps, trucks, and tanks.

Military and Ministry of Defense vehicles use the numerical convention where &quot;N&quot; is for numbers from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;9&quot; for registration and &quot;S&quot; denotes a special suffix number/letter which denotes the type of office or unit in which the person who owns the vehicle belongs to.

The suffix codes are:
=== Government officials ===

==== Executive branch ====

Vehicle registration plates belonging to senior government officials like the president or vice president always begins with which stands for &quot;Republik Indonesia&quot; and are followed by a number. For example, the president&#x27;s registration plate is , and the vice president&#x27;s is . Other senior officials such as government ministers, the chairman of the House of Representatives, the commander of the National Armed Forces and the chief of the National Police also share the same convention and are assigned the numbers after the President and vice president. These plates are used for everyday activities and have a black on white design.

There are some very special numbers, which are &#x27; and &#x27; for the president and vice president, respectively. These numbers are used for ceremonial purposes, such as presidential/vice-presidential inaugurations, national day ceremonies and armed forces day. On inauguration day, at the time the new president and vice president take the oath, the plates are moved from the former presidential/vice-presidential cars to the new car. These numbers are also used for all ceremonial presidential/vice-presidential cars, and have a white-on-red design.
==== Legislative branch ====
In May 2021, the Indonesian House of Representatives () introduced their owned special registration plates, in order to supervise their member&#x27;s driving behavior. The plate design is similar to the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s plate, but painted in black and white combination with the seal of the House of Representatives. The codes are:

For members of the parliament, the format is xx- where xx is the member number and is the faction number.

=== Foreign countries and international organizations ===
Registration plates for vehicles belonging to the government of foreign countries or international organizations follow a different convention. They used to have black letters on a white background with black trim on the bottom. In June 2022, the black trim was scrapped, so the plates would look similar to regular personal vehicle plates.

The plates have the letter &#x27; (abbreviation of &quot;Corps Diplomatique&quot;, French for Diplomatic Corps) followed by two or three digits denoting the country or organization, followed by up to three digits of the serial number. For example, a car with number &#x27; is owned by Vietnam. Generally, the number is reserved for an ambassador&#x27;s official vehicle.

The order of numbers is based on when they recognized Indonesia as a country. The United States was originally assigned ; due to the stigma associated with the number 13, they asked the Indian delegation to exchange numbers.

The list of countries and organizations follows:

Consulates also use the same format but instead of using the letters , they use .

Some foreign countries and international-organization vehicles in Jakarta use the &#x27; format and a normal white on black plate. Where &#x27; stands for five random digits, and stands for the country or organization code.

== Vanity plates ==

A few vehicle owners pay an extra amount of money to get a certain plate as their desire. An option for customized registration plate is available, with the vanity plates being officially called as &quot;Beautiful Number Plates&quot; (Indonesian: &quot;Plat Nomor Cantik&quot;). Prices vary depending on how many numerical digits a plate will have and if there&#x27;s letters after the number. Because the convention is not flexible to include a full word, people try creative uses of numbers and letters. For example, Idris Sardi, a violin player, uses (B 10 LA) for his vehicle. It is a play on the word BIOLA which means &quot;violin&quot; in Indonesian. Leoni, a famous actress and singer, uses L 30 NI for her car. Even the former President Megawati Soekarnoputri chooses &quot;M 3 GA&quot; for her personal vehicle, as the plate resembles her broadly-known nickname. Edhie Bhaskoro Yudhoyono, former President Yudhoyono&#x27;s younger son, has &quot;B 24 EB&quot;, which &quot;EB&quot; is being his name initial. With the new format of three suffix alphabets, many vanity or personal registration plates are possible to be created. For example, a Toyota Fortuner owner may choose the plate B 42 NER which sounds like B four-two-NER. Syahrini, an Indonesian singer, has &quot;B 1 SYR&quot; as her registration plate number, with &quot;SYR&quot; being her initials.

<text>Cartan is a small lunar impact crater near the eastern edge of the Moon. It lies just to the west of the larger Apollonius. The rim is circular with a tiny crater along the eastern side. The interior floor is about half the diameter of the crater. A smaller crater attached to the southern rim is also attached to the north rim of Apollonius H, forming a short crater chain.

It was named after the French mathematician Élie Cartan in 1976. Before, it was designated Apollonius D.

<doc id="978412" wikidata="Q659784" url="?curid=978412" title="Cauchy (crater)">
<text>Cauchy is a small lunar impact crater on the eastern Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy. It is circular and symmetric, with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. Due to the high albedo of this bowl-shaped formation, it is particularly prominent at full Moon.

Cauchy lies between the Rupes Cauchy and the Rimae Cauchy, as described below.

South of Rupes Cauchy are two lunar domes designated Omega (ω) Cauchy and Tau (τ) Cauchy. They lie to the south and southwest of Cauchy respectively. Each lunar dome has a small depression at its crest, which is likely to be a volcanic vent rather than an impact crater. The vent at the top of Omega Cauchy is called Donna.

==Rupes Cauchy==

To the south of Cauchy is a 120-km fault in the surface named the Rupes Cauchy, which forms a series of cliffs or escarpments. This wall roughly parallels the Rima Cauchy to the north.

Rupes Cauchy was named &quot;Fossa Casalis&quot; in a 1974 map, but this was not approved by the IAU. The term &quot;Rupes&quot; was used in favor of &quot;Fossa&quot; for the names of lunar scarps.

==Rima Cauchy==
To the north of Cauchy is the rille named Rima Cauchy, a 210-kilometer-long graben.

Rima Cauchy was named &quot;Fossa Cauchy&quot; in a 1974 map, but term &quot;Rima&quot; was used in favor of &quot;Fossa&quot; for the names of lunar rilles.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cauchy.


Cauchy A is shown as &quot;Hussein&quot; on some lunar maps based on Apollo 15 photographs, but the name was not approved by the IAU, which officially designated the crater name in 2006.

<doc id="978415" wikidata="Q125535132" url="?curid=978415" title="Cyan Garamonde">
<text>Cyan Garamonde (), known in Japan as , is a character introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square Enix. A samurai, he serves the Kingdom of Doma. However an invading Empire poisons its water supply, and as a result its citizens are killed, including Cyan&#x27;s wife and child. Driven by grief he seeks revenge against the Empire and joins the game&#x27;s roster of playable characters. He has since appeared in other games related to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo.

Cyan was well received, particularly regarding his character arc and the portrayal of his grief within the games. He has been praised as one of the characters with the most depth in the title and the franchise as a whole. In addition he has been observed as being unique amongst the game&#x27;s cast for his cultural background and how it may be perceived differently depending by Japanese and American audiences. His music theme within &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; has also been examined, not only in how it relates to his cultural imagery but also to the layers of his character.

==Appearances==
Cyan Garamonde is a samurai in the 1994 Square Enix video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. An old-fashioned and honorable man, he serves the king of the game&#x27;s Doma region. During a conflict with a rival Empire, the game&#x27;s antagonist Kefka poisons the water supply, killing not only most inside but also Cyan&#x27;s wife and child. Driven into rage he attacks the Empire on his own, later teaming up with the character Sabin. As they proceed, they accidentally board the Phantom Train, a spectral vehicle meant to transport dead spirits to the afterlife. Though they escape, Cyan is horrified to see the spirits of his loved ones board it. Despite his protests, the train proceeds forward, and his wife and child bit him farewell. Afterward they recruit the help of feral child Gau, and reunite with the rest of the playable cast.

After Kefka devastates the world, the party is separated and a time skip occurs. The ground finds Cyan, who has been writing letters to the wife of a deceased Imperial soldier and pretending to be him to ease her loss, and he decides to write one last letter admitting the truth to help her move on. If the party rests in Castle Doma after this point, the demon Wrexsoul attacks, trapping Cyan in his memories and unable to wake. After the party defeats him, Cyan makes peace with his grief and not only unlocks the full extent of his Bushido skill, but he also gains the sword Masamune.

In other games, he appears as a playable character in both &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;. He is additionally a playable character in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Ryūzaburō Ōtomo. Outside of video games, cards representing Cyan have been produced for the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;. A keychain figure based on his chibi artwork was also produced by Bandai, as part of a series to promote the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;.

==Conception and design==

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was developed with the mindset that none of the playable cast was the protagonist, and that each of them were equally the &quot;main character&quot;. The cast of characters were selected from submissions from across the development team, with programmer Hiroyuki Ito contributing Cyan. Once the characters were selected, each individual would write their character&#x27;s story, with Yoshinori Kitase balancing the plot as things developed. He was series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&#x27;s favorite character when developing the game, because Sakaguchi enjoyed the contrast between the masculinity of a samurai and the character&#x27;s slender feel. Originally named Cayenne in Japanese, due to the limited length of character names for the playable cast it was shorted to Cyan in Western localizations.

Cyan was meant to serve as a surrogate father to Gau and Sabin, each of them having lost their parents while Cyan had lost his family. His relationship with Gau was intended to be the closest, with the development team joking Cyan would routinely impart knowledge of the world upon Gau he learned only moments prior and he himself didn&#x27;t fully understand. Originally in development a character named Angela would have acted as a stereotypical &quot;big sister&quot; to him and jokingly flirt with Cyan. He would have brushed off these affections, but when alone would pause and &quot;flatter himself if it was all true&quot;. These moments were intended to show a private side to his character, though were never meant to lead to romantic feelings as Cyan was devoted to his deceased wife.

Standing 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall, an early draft of the character&#x27;s appearance was drawn by artist Tetsuya Nomura, while Yoshitaka Amano was commissioned to design the characters from the brief outlines provided. Given full creative freedom, Amano wanted to make &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation in-game as small computer sprites. Said graphics were designed by Nomura, who drew the chibi artwork of the characters, and Kazuko Shibuya, who designed the in-game sprites. In his finalized design, Cyan appears as a tall older man with long balding hair pulled back into a ponytail, a thick mustache, and wearing dark blue and brown armor.

Cyan&#x27;s personality was meant to feel &quot;serious and inflexible&quot;, though early in development he was to have a &quot;strange&quot; personality and give his sword attacks flashy names such as &quot;Super Explosive Shouryuu Zan!&quot; In the final he&#x27;s stated to have an &quot;old fashioned personality&quot;, with traits such as expecting modesty from women, though at the same time said personality was also intentionally vague to represent the cultural gap between him and the other characters. In the Japanese version this is further represented by his manner of speaking, with him ending sentences with &quot;gozaru&quot;, an archaic manner of saying &quot;to be&quot;. In English localizations, this was changed to him speaking in Early Modern English, with him frequently saying &quot;thou&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Cyan was mostly well received upon his debut, particularly for his character&#x27;s journey. Michael Sollosi of &quot;RPGFan&quot; described it as &quot;tragic, adorable, and dramatic at various points in Final Fantasy VI&quot;, and felt that the culmination in the battle with Wrexsoul was a particular high point of the game overall. He noted that while the conclusion of the fight offered its own rewards, he felt that witnessing &quot;Cyan’s self-actualization after all of his suffering&quot; was the true reward, and provided a memory of the game he&#x27;d never forget. While journalist Jason Schreier in an article for &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised all the characters in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, he particularly noted the impact of Cyan&#x27;s story, and felt his journey with Sabin &quot;could be spun out into a buddy comedy film&quot; of its own, drawing comparison to the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; films. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;″ Vladimir Olivares meanwhile felt the character&#x27;s growth from one motivated by revenge to finding some peace in helping others made him one of the best characters in the title, and saw his series of letters to the Imperial soldier&#x27;s widow as bringing some closure to his own grudge with the Empire.

The Phantom Train scene in particular was significantly discussed. &quot;Destructoid&quot; writer Chad Concelmo praised how Cyan&#x27;s grief was portrayed, and stated that the act of seeing his dead wife and child allowed the player to better relate to him as a character than if told through exposition alone. As a result, the player&#x27;s emotions are tied to the character, and the appearance of his wife and child boarding the Phantom Train triggers the same response it does in them as it does for Cyan, adding &quot;to the drama exponentially&quot;. This coupled with the minimalist sound design of the scene to add to the somber atmosphere led it to be one of Concelmo&#x27;s favorite moments in gaming. Aoife Wilson of &quot;Vice&quot; on the other hand stated that while she felt the character &quot;a bit of an idiot&quot; and &quot;one of those party members people tend to gloss over&quot; in favor of others in part due to his manner of speech, she shared similar sentiments to concelmo regarding the Phantom Train conclusion. Describing it as a &quot;sobering, heart-wrenching moment&quot;, she added that it instilled a sense of empathy and respect in the player for a character they may have previously seen as &quot;kind of a loser&quot;.

===Analysis of themes and music===

In the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Pierre Maugein stated that while Cyan was portrayed as more of a &quot;Shakespearean swashbuckler&quot; in the localized versions of &quot;VI&quot;, his personality as a &quot;mature, strong-willed man&quot; in both versions showed an &quot;intransigence in keeping with his inspirations&quot;. His portrayal as a husband and a father in Maugein&#x27;s eyes gave the character more gravity, and allowed him to be seen as a &quot;potential leader, both humane and fierce, while still maintaining a sensitive side.&quot; He found this type of protagonist not only common throughout the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, but also in distancing his character from that of the unattached hero archetype. Maugein added that Cyan was also different from other characters in the game, as while loss was a recurring theme in Cyan&#x27;s case, he was frequently reliving it, pointing at the implication of the Phantom Train scene&#x27;s conclusion in his willingness to sacrifice his life to be with his family, and how it illustrated the cyclical tragedy of death and abandonment. Furthermore, while Cyan&#x27;s struggles with Wrexsoul and its minions showed him shedding his pain, loss and sadness, his helping of the widow could also be seen as him coping with his own loss, and in the final letter he sends her an acknowledgement that both of them must move on. He was ultimately glad Angela was cut as a character concept, as he felt it would have undermined what he came to see as one of the &quot;most elaborate characters in both &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and the entire series as a whole&quot;.

Sebastian Deken in his book examining &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and its themes saw Cyan representative of the philosophical concept of &quot;the other&quot; when observed through an American gaze, though felt Japanese players may see him as more of a conservative character compared to their current societal standards. This was demonstrated both through views of the world and manner of speaking, but also the visual differences from the other characters, particularly his uniquely black hair and his more narrow eyes shown on his sprite when compared to the rest of the game&#x27;s playable cast. Deken also felt that he was representative of the concept of extinction, as he&#x27;s the sole person to carry his people&#x27;s memory and culture forward after the genocidal attack upon his country.

Deken went further to say many of these traits were also represented in his musical theme, which featured instruments not typically found in Western orchestras. Amongst these are the shakuhachi, a flute associated with spiritual practices in Japan&#x27;s feudal period, and taiko drums. In addition they utilized repetitive movements and strings, suggesting a more rigid way of thinking that echoed Cyan&#x27;s more conservative approach. However, as the song proceeds these instruments and repetitive elements are removed, giving way to a theme that sounds similar to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; orchestral work, illustrating his sense of loss and helping to portray him as a deeper character than his earlier comedic moments would imply while helping to inform the listener what kind of person Cyan is. He added that unlike other character themes in the game, Cyan&#x27;s illustrated a shift in personality in tone; where others illustrated a constant forward march, Cyan&#x27;s theme &quot;drops its sword and kneels&quot;.

McDonough grew up in Barnstable, Massachusetts and was raised Catholic. His childhood nickname was &quot;Headster&quot;, which McDonough says originated in his brothers&#x27; teasing him about the size of his head. He graduated from Barnstable High School, and attended Syracuse University, where he was initiated and became a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1988. He had obtained several college scholarships to play baseball, but decided to go to Syracuse, as he thought it had the best theater department.

<text>C. Herschel is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the western part of Mare Imbrium. It is named after German astronomer Caroline Herschel. It is a circular, bowl-shaped formation that has not undergone significant erosion. The interior floor has the same low albedo as the surrounding lunar mare. To the south-southwest is the similar crater Heis. C. Herschel lies on a wrinkle ridge of the lunar mare named the Dorsum Heim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to C. Herschel.

<text>Clerke is a tiny lunar impact crater named after Irish astronomer Agnes Mary Clerke, who played a role in bringing astronomy and astrophysics to the public in Victorian England. It is located near the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis in the midst of a rille system named the Rimae Littrow after the crater Littrow to the east. It is roughly circular and cup-shaped, with a relatively high albedo. In a valley to the southeast is the landing site of the Apollo 17 mission. Clerke was previously designated Littrow B.

<doc id="978437" wikidata="Q862614" url="?curid=978437" title="Voiceless alveolar affricate">
<text>A voiceless alveolar affricate is a type of affricate consonant pronounced with the tip or blade of the tongue against the alveolar ridge (gum line) just behind the teeth. This refers to a class of sounds, not a single sound. There are several types with significant perceptual differences:
*The voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate is the most common type, similar to the &quot;ts&quot; in English &quot;cats&quot;.
*The voiceless alveolar non-sibilant affricate or , using the alveolar diacritic from the Extended IPA, is somewhat similar to the &quot;th&quot; in some pronunciations of English &quot;eighth&quot;. It is found as a regional realization of the sequence in some Sicilian dialects of Standard Italian.
*The voiceless alveolar lateral affricate is found in certain languages, such as Cherokee, Mexican Spanish, and Nahuatl.
*The &quot;voiceless alveolar retracted sibilant affricate&quot; , also called apico-alveolar or grave, has a weak hushing sound reminiscent of affricates. One language in which it is found is Basque, where it contrasts with a more conventional non-retracted laminal alveolar affricate.
This article discusses the first two. 

==Voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate==

The voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate is a type of consonantal sound, used in some spoken languages. The sound is transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet with or (formerly with or ). The voiceless alveolar affricate occurs in many Indo-European languages, such as German (which was also part of the High German consonant shift), Kashmiri, Marathi,
Pashto, Russian and most other Slavic languages such as Polish and Serbo-Croatian; also, among many others, in Georgian, in Mongolia, and Tibetan Sanskrit, in Japanese, in Mandarin Chinese, and in Cantonese. Some international auxiliary languages, such as Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua also include this sound.

===Features===
Features of the voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate:
*The stop component of this affricate is laminal alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge. For simplicity, this affricate is usually called after the sibilant fricative component.
*There are at least three specific variants of the fricative component:
** Dentalized laminal alveolar (commonly called &quot;dental&quot;), which means it is articulated with the tongue blade very close to the upper front teeth, with the tongue tip resting behind lower front teeth. The hissing effect in this variety of is very strong.
** Non-retracted alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Retracted alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue slightly behind the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;. Acoustically, it is close to or laminal .

=== Occurrence ===
The following sections are named after the fricative component.

<text>State station (also called State Street) is an underground Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) rapid transit station located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It is the transfer point between the Orange Line and the Blue Line, and one of four &quot;hub stations&quot; on the MBTA subway system. The Orange Line has two side platforms on two levels, while the Blue Line has two side platforms on a single level. The station is fully accessible.

The East Boston Tunnel (predecessor of the modern Blue Line) opened as a streetcar tunnel in 1904, with Devonshire one of its two stations in downtown Boston. The Washington Street Tunnel opened to carry the Main Line (predecessor of the Orange Line) in 1908, with platforms at Milk and State. In 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted to use metro rolling stock. The MBTA renamed the lines to the Blue Line and Orange Line in 1965, and renamed both stations to State in 1967. The Orange Line platforms were extended in the 1980s for six-car trains. A second renovation in 2006–2011 extended the Blue Line platforms and made all platforms accessible.

==Station layout==
State is unique among Orange Line stations as it was built on two levels to fit under the narrow section of Washington Street while crossing the East Boston Tunnel. The southbound side platform is above the northbound track and furthermore staggered considerably south of the northbound side platform. The southbound platform is connected to the rest of the station by a lengthy pedestrian passageway, originally known as &quot;the speedway&quot;. The Blue Line has two side platforms under State Street and the Old State House. The Blue line platforms are on the same level as the southbound Orange Line platform; the Blue Line tracks pass over the northbound Orange Line platform. The station is served by MBTA bus routes .

The station&#x27;s headhouses are located between Government Center and the Financial District. State station has six entrances spread out over nearly ; after consolidation and reconstruction by the MBTA, all entrances serve both lines in all directions. One entrance is built into the basement of the Old State House and four into commercial buildings. The northernmost entrance, which is accessed from an unmarked stairwell under 28 State Street on Government Center Plaza, was originally constructed to serve Adams Square but now primarily serves Boston City Hall.

Three entrances are fully accessible with elevators to platform level: Old South Meeting House (Washington Street at Milk Street), 53 State Street, and 60 State Street. The other three entrances - Old State House (State Street at Devonshire Street), Devonshire Street at Water Street, and Government Center Plaza - are not accessible. Two additional elevators connect the northbound Orange Line platform with the eastbound Blue Line platform and southbound Orange Line platform, while an accessible ramp connects the westbound Blue Line platform with the northbound Orange Line platform.

===Public art===
The station has several works of public art:
*The passageway to the southbound Orange Line platform was painted with rainbow colors by Robert V. Kennedy in March 1972. The painting and corresponding timed lighting (no longer in use) cost $9,000. Kennedy won the 1971 competition to design artwork for the station.
*&quot;Polychrome painted star&quot;, a 1975 enamel-on-porcelain mural by Toshihiro Katayama, is located in the passage to the eastbound Blue Line platform.
*A 1987 black steel gate by Albert Paley is located next to the Old South Meeting House headhouse.

==History==
===East Boston Tunnel===
The Blue Line section of the station was built along with the rest of the East Boston Tunnel in the first years of the 20th century and opened on December 30, 1904, serving streetcars running from downtown to East Boston. An unusual aspect of State Street station is the entrance built directly into one of Boston&#x27;s best-known historic sites, the Old Massachusetts State House. The East Boston Tunnel station was originally known as Devonshire after the street which the Old State House is located on. The station is the only remaining station on the tunnel opened in 1904.

The East Boston Tunnel was originally planned to be operated with high-floor metro rolling stock and connected to the then-planned Cambridge Elevated line. When that plan was dropped in 1903 due to a disagreement between the BTC and the BERy, the stations were built with low platforms. Large bi-loading streetcars (with high floors but capable of loading from low platforms), which incorporated many attributes from metro cars used on the Main Line El, began use in 1905. However, neither these nor the large center-entrance cars introduced in 1917 (which were designed for multiple unit operation) could fully handle the crowds.

In 1921, the Boston Transit Department (BTD) - the successor to the BTC - began work at Maverick Square to convert the East Boston Tunnel to high-floor metro trains. The next year, the BTD board approved the construction of high-level platforms at Atlantic Avenue, Devonshire, Scollay Under, and Bowdoin. Construction of concrete high-level platforms above the rails at Devonshire began in December 1923 or January 1924. A section of low-level platform was left to serve streetcars during construction. The station was also extended by to accommodate the new trains, with work completed on March 1, 1924. Over the weekend of April 18–21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted to high-floor metro stock. Temporary wooden platform sections were put in place to allow service to begin on April 21, with the permanent concrete sections completed by July 12. The edges of the original low platforms can still be seen under the high platforms.

On March 31, 1937, the BERy opened an entrance from the Exchange Building lobby to the eastbound platform. The entrance was closed around 1981 as the building was modified for construction of Exchange Place.
===Washington Street Tunnel===

The Washington Street Tunnel opened on November 30, 1908, to Main Line elevated trains running between and . As with the other stations in the tunnel; the two platforms were treated as completely separate stations. The northbound platform was known as State since its main entrance was at the cross street of State Street, while the southbound platform was similarly Milk Street after its entrance from Milk Street. (The station pair was designated on some maps as Milk/State).
===MBTA era===
After taking over operations in 1964, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began rebranding efforts. The East Boston Tunnel/Revere Extension and Main Line El/Washington Street Tunnel routes were renamed as the Blue Line and Orange Line on August 25, 1965. On January 25, 1967, the separate station names of Devonshire and Milk/State were changed to State. In 1971, the MBTA and Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston held a competition called &quot;Design in Transit&quot;, with the winning work to be placed in the passageway to the southbound Orange Line platform. It attracted over 300 entries, many of which were criticized for being inappropriate for the setting: &quot;spooky shadow play&quot; that would scare riders already in a nervous atmosphere, and audio works that would add to the cacophony of the busy station. The winning work by Robert V. Kennedy had swatches of bright rainbow colors with timed lighting; it was installed in 1972.

That year, the agency received a federal grant that funded two-thirds of a $14.3 million modernization program for downtown stations. As part of that project, the MBTA investigated the feasibility of connecting , , Washington, and State with pedestrian tunnels. The MBTA proposed to make the City Hall (Adams Square) headhouse exit-only during budget cuts in 1981.

In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven Red Line and three Orange Line stations to allow the use of six-car trains. On October 16, 1985, the MBTA awarded a $5.03 million contract for the Orange Line work at State. Construction at State began that year and was completed in 1987. The project extended both Orange Line platforms (the shell of the northbound extension had been constructed during an earlier modernization project), and rebuilt the Milk Street entrance. Elevators were added from Milk Street to the southbound platform, and between the Orange Line platforms; this made both Orange Line platforms and the eastbound Blue Line platform accessible. (Until renovations at Haymarket and North Station in 2001, State was the closest accessible subway station to the North Station commuter rail terminal.) Six-car trains entered service on August 18, 1987, shortly after the platform extensions were complete.

From 1997 to 2000, State was renamed State/Citizens Bank in a $500,000 corporate sponsorship from Citizens Bank, who had recently moved to the area, and hoped to eventually have the name changed to simply Citizens Bank Plaza. The sponsorship failed and the name reverted to State. During the renovation of station, during which that station was closed, State was renamed temporarily State/Aquarium from October 14, 2000, to October 29, 2001.

====21st century changes====
An extensive renovation of State began in November 2004. The project added accessible Blue Line entrances at 53 State and 60 State, extended the Blue Line platforms for 6-car trains, and added a ramp between the inbound Blue Line platform and the northbound Orange Line platform. The MBTA initially expected the work to be completed in 2007 at a cost of $38 million. However, several factors prolonged the project and increased its cost. Keeping the station open during extensive underground construction proved more difficult than expected; support structures had to be drilled through centuries-old foundations and seawalls. The MBTA settled a lawsuit over systemwide accessibility issues in 2006, which necessitated changes to the station design. The settlement included the replacement of the existing elevator connecting the two platform levels.

The change from token payment to the Charliecard system required closing the Blue Line level of the station from June 24 to July 1, 2006. A new between-levels elevator was completed in 2010 in lieu of replacing the existing elevator. The reconstruction of the station was substantially completed in 2011, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 26. The final project cost was $68.3 million, of which about $12 million was design and land acquisition. In October 2011, a 1904 plaque that marked the completion of the East Boston Tunnel was reinstalled in the station.

On June 24, 2019, the MBTA Board awarded a $29.7 million, 16-month contract for full cleaning, wayfinding signage replacement, and other improvements at North Station, Haymarket, State, and Downtown Crossing stations. The work was completed in June 2021. The entire Orange Line, including the Orange Line platforms at State station, was closed from August 19 to September 18, 2022, during maintenance work. A &quot;Charlie Service Center&quot; for MBTA customer service opened near the Old South Meeting House entrance on July 29, 2024, replacing the former CharlieCard Store at Downtown Crossing station.

In May 2020, the MBTA awarded a $8.7 million design contract for accessibility renovations at State and . The work at State includes two elevators at the City Hall entrance, replacements of two existing elevators, and renovation of the Milk Street entrance. Design work reached 30% completion in 2021 and 75% completion in 2022. In a separate project, the original between-levels elevator was replaced in situ in 2023.

<doc id="978446" wikidata="Q6138694" url="?curid=978446" title="James Mackay (New Zealand politician, born 1804)">
<text>James Mackay (1804 – 29 May 1875) was a New Zealand politician. He was a member of the 1st New Zealand Parliament. He is remembered for the incident with Henry Sewell in Parliament in 1854.

==Early life==
James Mackay was born in 1804 in Aberdeen, Scotland, the second son of Alexander Mackie and Elspet (née Davidson). Though his father was the owner of a large shipping company in Aberdeen, James reinvented himself as being born and bred a highlander, which is a likely reason for him assuming the name Mackay.

As a young man he moved to London where he was employed as a banker, probably by Lloyds, as he remained their agent in Nelson until 1859. He had studied political economy and free trade principals under John Ramsay McCulloch, which he claimed meant that he supported all measures which had a progressive tendency. Politically, he participated in committees and actively supported liberal causes such as the passing of the Reform Bill, which gave greater suffrage to common people.

==Family and emigration to New Zealand==

In about 1831, when they were both 27, Mackay married Ann Charles. From 1829 to 1848 they had eight children, the first six being born in London and the youngest two in New Zealand. They also raised two sons of his late younger brother, who were born in Edinburgh. At the end of 1844 the family embarked from London on the &quot;Slains Castle&quot; for Nelson, New Zealand. Before leaving, Mackay commissioned a painting which portrays the family as highlanders departing Scotland in tartans and travel attire, stocked with sheep, calves, poultry, ploughs and other accoutrements required for starting a new life in a distant land.

Arriving in Nelson in January 1845, Mackay established a farm in Wakapuaka, which he named Drumduan. He also had a town house, a sheep-run in the Wairau after 1847, and in 1852 he established a cattle and sheep-run in Golden Bay in conjunction with his eldest son James Mackay junior.

Mackay soon became actively involved with local affairs, joining institutions and voicing his opinion at public meetings. He joined the volunteer forces and had the rank of captain. He was also a magistrate.

==Political career==
When representative government was established in New Zealand in 1853, he became a member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Nelson. He was also a member of the Provincial Council for the Town of Nelson from 1857 to 1861.


In the 1st New Zealand Parliament, the Town of Nelson was a two-member electorate. On nomination day on 25 July 1853, William Travers and Mackay were the only candidates put forward. They were thus declared elected unopposed. Mackay served until the end of the first term in 1855, but did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments.
Mackay is noted for his support of the Acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, who argued that it was not possible for Parliament to assume responsibility for governing New Zealand without royal assent. When Parliament disagreed, Wynyard officially prorogued it. Parliament responded by suspending its own standing orders. These orders required that messages from the Governor take precedence over other Parliamentary business.

With the standing orders overturned, Wynyard&#x27;s message could remain officially &quot;unopened&quot; while Parliament continued to function. Mackay, part of the minority who supported Wynyard, attempted to bypass this tactic by presenting a copy of The New Zealand Gazette which contained the prorogation order, shouting &quot;you are no House, you are prorogued!&quot;. He then attempted to disrupt the business of Parliament until Henry Sewell (later to become New Zealand&#x27;s first Premier) and another MP attempted to manhandle him out of the debating chamber. Mackay managed to escape, and (in the words of a contemporary) &quot;beat an honourable retreat over the rail into the stranger&#x27;s gallery, waving defiance to his assailants with his trusty umbrella.&quot; Mackay was later found guilty of &quot;gross and premeditated contempt of the House&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Mackay was a close friend of the Native Secretary Donald McLean. Through his contact he assisted his eldest son, James Mackay junior, to enter Government service. James junior became an Assistant Native Secretary in 1857, and from 1859 to 1860 purchased Kaikōura and the West Coast from Māori on behalf of the General Government. In 1863 he became commissioner for the Hauraki District, in 1867 he opened the Thames district for gold mining, and in 1875 he extended the goldfield by negotiating with Māori for access to the Ohinemuri district. He also acted as a general trouble shooter for the Government during times of conflict with the Māori of the North Island.

The eldest of the two nephews raised by Mackay, Alexander, also entered Government service. He was appointed commissioner of Native Reserves (firstly for the South Island then for the entire country), commissioner of the South Island Native District, and returning officer for the Southern Maori electoral seat for the House of Representatives. Most notably, from 1884 until he retired in 1902 he was a judge for the Native Land Court.

Mackay&#x27;s wife Anne died in 1860 at the age of 56. In 1862 he married Ann Adney Shuckburgh, who was 20 years his junior. They had two daughters, born in 1863 and 1864. He spent his later years farming, and though still taking an active interest in local politics, he was reluctant to re-enter public office. In early 1874 he fell from a loaded cart while working on his farm. The injury to his back, though it seemed minor at the time, grew into a tumour which eventually left him paralyzed. He died in May 1875 at the age of 71.

Mackay and his first wife are buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Wakapuaka. The church no longer exists, and the churchyard was designated an historic site by Waimea County Council in 1975.

<text>Yukthivadi (The Rationalist) was the first rationalist/atheist journal published in Malayalam. The contribution made by &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; to the renaissance of Kerala, India is significant. The launch of &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; marks the beginning of organised rationalism in Kerala, which is a key constituent of the Reformation Movement in the state.

==History and profile==
&quot;Yukthivadi&quot; started its publication in August 1929 from Ernakulam under the editorial board of M. Ramavarma Thampan, C. Krishnan, C. V. Kunhiraman, Sahodaran Ayyappan and M.C. Joseph. In a statement published in the first issue of &quot;Yukthivadi&quot;, Sahodaran K. Ayyappan wrote:
:&quot;Rationalism is not a religion. It is an attitude to accept knowledge based upon reason. &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; will attempt to generate such an attitude amongst the people. To do this, we will have to criticize irrational faiths and propagate rational knowledge. Since &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; does not believe in any ultimate knowledge, it will not hesitate to correct itself based upon the latest information and knowledge. Every rationalist is bound to do so. The only maxim that &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; accepts as unchangeable is that the knowledge should be based upon reason&quot;.

In spite of the fact that all of the editorial board members were well known social activists, the conservative Kerala welcomed its publication with expected derision. Even such a well known personality as Moorkoth Kumaran did not hesitate to pen a poem denigrating the publishers. Not surprisingly, a meeting of a religious sect passed a resolution cursing the publishers of &quot;Yukthivadi&quot;!

In August 1931 M.C.Joseph became its sole editor-publisher and shifted the publication to Irinjalakkuda. For the next forty five years until June 1974 M.C.Joseph brought out the magazine without any interruption. In July 1974, because of his failing health (he was 87 then), he handed over the magazine to Unni Kakkanad, who published it for yet another decade before it ceased publication1.

The vibrant rationalist movement that is seen in Kerala today is undoubtedly the direct consequence of the ideas spread by &quot;Yukthivadi&quot; for more than half a century.

<text>The South African Grand Prix was first run as a Grand Prix motor racing handicap race in 1934 at the Prince George Circuit at East London, Cape Province. It drew top drivers from Europe including Bernd Rosemeyer, Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Seaman, Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth and the 1939 winner Luigi Villoresi.

World War II brought an end to the race, but it was revived in 1960 as part of the Formula One circuit, entering the World Championship calendar two years later. It was a popular F1 event, but the Grand Prix was suspended right after the controversial 1985 race, due to the nation&#x27;s policy of apartheid. Following the end of apartheid in 1991, the race returned to the Formula One schedule in 1992 and 1993. The 1993 race was the last South African Grand Prix, . Plans to revive the race in 2024 have been abandoned.

==History==

===East London (1934–1966)===

The first South African Grands Prix were held on a road course known as the Prince George Circuit, running through different populated areas of the coastal city of East London. This was shortened to in 1936. When racing resumed after World War II, a permanent circuit was built in 1959 that retained the name &quot;Prince George Circuit&quot;. The first World Championship F1 race in South Africa was held on 29 December 1962. In that race, Graham Hill took advantage of Jim Clark&#x27;s mechanical problems with his Lotus and took race victory and the championship. The race was held at Prince George again in 1963, 1965 and 1966, the latter relegated to non-championship status as a new 3-litre formula came into effect on the same day. In 1967, the race was moved to the Kyalami circuit near the high-altitude inland city of Johannesburg in the Transvaal, where it would remain as long as the South African Grand Prix was on the official Formula One calendar.

===Kyalami (1967–1985,1992–1993)===
The fast Kyalami circuit, which was built in the early 1960s, played host to its first South African Grand Prix in 1967, where privateer John Love nearly took victory but ran into fuel problems late in the race, and Mexican Pedro Rodríguez took victory. 1968 saw Clark take victory; he broke Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s record for most career wins and it turned out to be his last F1 victory; he was killed at a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim later that year. 1969 saw Jackie Stewart win, and the following year 44-year-old veteran Jack Brabham won his last F1 race. 1971 saw American Mario Andretti win his maiden Grand Prix, on debut for Ferrari. 1974 saw American Peter Revson crash horribly at Barbeque Bend during testing for the race and slam head-on to the barriers; he later died from his injuries. Argentine Carlos Reutemann won for the first time at that year&#x27;s event. 1975 saw South African Jody Scheckter take victory. The 1977 event was the location of one of the most gruesome crashes in history, as Tom Pryce was killed when he hit and killed track marshal Frederick Jansen Van Vuuren at full speed. Niki Lauda won the race, but the accident sent shock waves throughout the sport. 1978 saw Ronnie Peterson take a late victory from Patrick Depailler and Riccardo Patrese; the 1979 event was held in changeable weather conditions and was won by Canadian Gilles Villeneuve.

Going into the 1980s, turbo-charged cars began to dominate the Grand Prix. Because of the high altitude of the fast Kyalami circuit (approximately 6,000 feet above sea level) the forced induction turbo engines could regulate how much air went into the engine whereas the normally aspirated engines could not; the turbo-charged engines had a horsepower advantage in 1982 of 150 hp over the normally aspirated engines, and often qualified on the front row of the grid considerably faster than the normally aspirated engined cars; and the Renault team dominated both the 1980 and 1982 races; Frenchman Alain Prost won the 1982 race after he lost a wheel around mid-distance; he charged through the field and took victory from Carlos Reutemann. The 1981 event was a victim of the FISA–FOCA war. As agreement could not be reached with FISA for the Grand Prix to be run as a round of the Formula One World Championship or as a non-championship Formula One race, it was officially staged as a Formula Libre event. Consequently, it was contested only by the FOCA-aligned teams, with cars which did not strictly comply with the 1981 Formula One regulations. The 1983 event was the last race of that season, and it saw a three-way battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship between Prost, Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Frenchman René Arnoux. Prost and Arnoux both went out with engine problems and Piquet took 3rd place and the Drivers&#x27; Championship; Prost made scathing comments about Renault&#x27;s conservative approach to developing the car, and he was fired from the team. Piquet&#x27;s Italian teammate Riccardo Patrese won the race. 1984 saw the event take place early in the season, and Prost (now driving for McLaren) started from the pit lane in the spare car after his race car didn&#x27;t start. This was made legal when the first start was aborted after Briton Nigel Mansell stalled on the grid. Prost drove through the field to finish 2nd behind his teammate Niki Lauda. Briton Derek Warwick completed the podium in a Renault and Brazilian future world champion Ayrton Senna scored his first point in a Toleman, finishing 6th.

The 1985 race was mired in international controversy as nations began boycotting South African sporting events because of a state of emergency declared by the South African government in July of that year because of a surge of violence related to racial segregation in the country, called apartheid. Most people involved in Formula One were strongly against going to race in South Africa. Some governments tried to ban their drivers from going, and the Ligier and Renault teams did boycott the race in line with the French Government&#x27;s ban on sporting events in South Africa; however French drivers Alain Prost, who had wrapped up the 1985 championship in the previous race, and Philippe Streiff, both driving for British teams, did take part. British driver Nigel Mansell won his second consecutive Formula One race and his teammate Keke Rosberg stormed around the track after 2 pitstops to take 2nd, completing a 1–2 for the Williams team. 1985 was the final South African Grand Prix until the end of apartheid, with FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre announcing days after the race that a Grand Prix would not return to the nation because of apartheid.

After the end of apartheid in 1991, Formula One returned to Kyalami for two Grands Prix in 1992 and 1993. The 1992 event was dominated by Mansell and the 1993 running saw an intense battle between Prost, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher, with Prost taking victory. In July 1993 Kyalami was sold to the South African Automobile Association, which managed to run the facility at a profit; however, running a Formula One event proved too costly and the Grand Prix did not return, that year&#x27;s race having also been the last time that F1 came to the African continent.

The only South African driver to win the South African Grand Prix was Jody Scheckter in 1975. British driver Jim Clark won it 4 times and Austrian driver Niki Lauda won 3 times.

=== Possibility of a return ===
In April 2018, &quot;The South African&quot; discussed the possibility of South Africa returning to the Formula One Grand Prix calendar with Adrian Scholtz, CEO of Motorsport South Africa. He said that the main obstacles are the high costs of hosting such an event and the fact that currently no South African racetrack fulfills the FIA requirements to host a Formula One race, although Kyalami comes close. 

In early 2023, a deal for a return of the South African Grand Prix for the 2024 season was close to finalization, but in June 2023, the FIA declared that the South African Grand Prix would not return to the F1 calendar for the near future due to the South African government&#x27;s stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>Apollonius is a lunar impact crater located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It lies in the region of uplands to the west of Mare Undarum and northeast of the Sinus Successus on the Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga. It is southwest of the crater Firmicus, and north of Condon.

The outer rim of Apollonius is somewhat worn and is overlain by a pair of small craters (including Apollonius E) across the western wall. The nearly flat interior floor has a low albedo and has been covered by lava. It lacks a central peak or notable small craters across the bottom.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Apollonius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Apollonius C — &quot;See&quot; Ameghino (crater).
* Apollonius D — &quot;See&quot; Cartan (crater).
* Apollonius G — &quot;See&quot; Townley (crater).
* Apollonius K — &quot;See&quot; Abbot (crater).
* Apollonius P — &quot;See&quot; Daly (lunar crater).
* Apollonius T — &quot;See&quot; Bombelli (crater).
* Apollonius W — &quot;See&quot; Petit (crater).

<text>Picard is a lunar impact crater that lies in Mare Crisium. The crater is named for 17th century French astronomer and geodesist Jean Picard. It is the biggest non-flooded crater of this mare, being slightly larger than Peirce to the north-northwest. To the west is the almost completely flooded crater Yerkes. To east of Picard is the tiny Curtis.

Picard is a crater from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago. Inside Picard is a series of terraces that seismologists have attributed to a collapse of the crater floor. It has a cluster of low hills at the bottom.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Picard. 


The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Picard G — &quot;see&quot; Tebbutt.

* Picard X — &quot;see&quot; Fahrenheit.
* Picard Z — &quot;see&quot; Curtis.

<doc id="978501" wikidata="Q1455399" url="?curid=978501" title="Pinback">
<text>Pinback is an American indie rock band from San Diego, California. The band was formed in 1998 by singers, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Armistead Burwell Smith IV and Rob Crow, who have been its two constant members. They have released five studio albums and several other releases.

==History and origin==
The band&#x27;s moniker is a reference to a character in the 1974 film &quot;Dark Star&quot; (played by Dan O&#x27;Bannon). Audio samples from this film are used frequently in the band&#x27;s early works.

In 2004, Pinback signed to Touch and Go Records. They released their third album, &quot;Summer in Abaddon&quot;, later that year. In 2006, the band released a collection of rarities, entitled &quot;Nautical Antiques&quot;. Pinback&#x27;s fourth full-length album, &quot;Autumn of the Seraphs&quot;, was released on September 11, 2007. They appeared live in a nationally broadcast interview and played a couple of songs on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; on October 8, 2007.

On April 1, 2009, Pinback announced they were working on a new album that would be released by Temporary Residence Ltd. Their fifth studio album, &quot;Information Retrieved&quot;, was released October 16, 2012. On August 15, 2012, Pinback released the song &quot;Proceed to Memory&quot; from &quot;Information Retrieved&quot; free to play through RollingStone.com.

Smith and Crow have been the band&#x27;s two consistent members. They are typically joined by drummer Chris Prescott; Tom Zinser and Mario Rubalcaba have previously contributed drums. Other past members of the Pinback live band include: Erik Hoversten, Braden Diotte, Terrin Durfey, Ryan Bromley, Cameron Jones, Kenseth Thibideau, Brent Asbury, Gabriel Voiles, Dmitri Dziensuwski, Donny Van Zandt, and Thatcher Orbitashi.

<text>Anderson Regional Transportation Center (RTC) (noted on MBTA schedules and maps as Anderson/Woburn, and on Amtrak schedules and maps as Woburn–Anderson) is a train and bus station located at 100 Atlantic Avenue, off Commerce Way, in Woburn, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. It can be accessed from Exit 30 off Interstate 93 or Exit 54 (Washington Street) from southbound Interstate 95/Route 128.

It opened on April 28, 2001, replacing nearby as Woburn&#x27;s main Amtrak and MBTA station. It was named in memory of James R. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Anderson (1968–1981), whose death led to the Woburn Wells court case (&quot;Anderson v. Cryovac&quot;) chronicled in the book, and film, &quot;A Civil Action&quot;.

==History==

A station at South Wilmington was open until June 14, 1959.

The station and the surrounding commercial-industrial area was redeveloped from the Industri-Plex Superfund site. The site is a former chemical and glue manufacturing facility. Industri-Plex was used for manufacturing chemicals such as lead-arsenic insecticides, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid for local textile, leather, and paper manufacturing industries from 1853 to 1931. Chemicals manufactured by other industries at the site include phenol, benzene, and toluene. Industri-Plex was also used to manufacture glue from raw animal hide and chrome-tanned hide wastes from 1934 to 1969. The by-products and residues from these industries caused the soils within the site to become contaminated with elevated levels of metals, such as arsenic, lead, and chrome. During the 1970s, the site was redeveloped for industrial use. Excavations uncovered and mixed industrial by-products and wastes accumulated over 130 years. During this period, residues from animal hide wastes used in the manufacture of glue were relocated on-site from buried pits to piles near swampy areas on the property. Many of the animal hide piles and lagoons on-site were leaching toxic metals into the environment. In the 1980s, the site contained streams and ponds, a warehouse and office buildings, remnant manufacturing buildings, and hide waste deposits buried on the site. The site was cleaned up using the capping technique, in which an impermeable layer seals the top of the hazardous waste site, preventing further pollution.

The station was originally to be called MetroNorth Center after the surrounding development. A groundbreaking ceremony for the station was held in April 2000. In October 2006, the MBTA added four short turn round trips that terminated at Anderson RTC. By 2012, the parking lot was still underused.

Until December 2020, a small number of Haverhill Line trains ran via the Wildcat Branch and the inner Lowell Line, making stops including Anderson/Woburn. This routing was resumed in April 2021, with the trains no longer making the intermediate stops. From September 9 to November 5, 2023, all outer Haverhill Line service was routed over the Wildcat Branch during signal work on the inner part of the Haverhill Line. The diverted trains stopped at Anderson/Woburn, with connecting shuttle buses operating to . Beginning May 20, 2024, weekday midday inbound Haverhill Line trains were again temporarily routed over the Wildcat Branch during construction work, again stopping only at Anderson/Woburn.

In June 2022, the MBTA indicated it was considering improvements to a siding in Woburn, which would allow 30-minute headways between Boston and Anderson/Woburn by 2024.
==Connections==

Massport operates Logan Express bus service from the station directly to Logan Airport terminals, with service on hourly or half-hourly headways except late at night. Logan Express service moved from Mishawum to Anderson RTC on April 8, 2001, three weeks ahead of rail service. The move doubled Logan Express parking available in Woburn from 450 spaces to 900.

Several other connecting services have previously been run. Beginning in June 2005, the Route 128 Business Council ran a &quot;Metro North Shuttle&quot; from the station to Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center and a business center in Woburn. The service was discontinued in July 2006 due to poor ridership and a loss of state funding. In November 2006, the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport began a shuttle service between the airport and Anderson station, free to ticketed airline passengers. The shuttle, part of a strategy to expand Manchester&#x27;s visibility as a less crowded alternative to Logan Airport, was replaced with a non-free private shuttle to downtown Boston at the end of June 2008.

There are separate parking lots for overnight parking and for commuter rail (day-only) parking. The overnight lot is intended for airport and Amtrak customers and is more expensive. The Massport lot has 875 spaces and the MBTA lot has 1,500 spaces.

<text>The role of Greek Buddhist monks in the development of the Buddhist faith under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka around 260 BCE and subsequently during the reign of the Indo-Greek king Menander (r. 165/155–130 BCE) is described in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, an important non-canonical Theravada Buddhist historical text compiled in Sri Lanka in the 6th century in the Pali language.

The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; or &quot;Great Chronicle&quot; covers the history of Buddhism from the 6th century BCE to the 4th century CE. It was written in the 6th century by the monk Mahanama, brother of King Dhatusena of Anuradhapura, and heavily relied on the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; or &quot;Island Chronicle&quot; written five centuries earlier.

==Background==
Emperor Ashoka convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BCE at Pāṭaliputra (today&#x27;s Patna). It was held by the monk Moggaliputta.

The Pāli Canon, which consists of the Theravada texts of reference and considered to be directly transmitted from the Buddha, was formalized at that time. It is known as the &quot;Tipiṭaka&quot; or &quot;Three Baskets&quot; and contains doctrine (Sutta Pitaka), monastic discipline (Vinaya Pitaka) and a compendium of philosophy (the Abhidhamma Pitaka).

Another objective of the council was to reconcile the different schools of Buddhism and to purify Buddhism, particularly from opportunistic factions which had been attracted by the royal patronage.

Finally, the council also reported on the proselytizing efforts of Ashoka, who sought to expand the Buddhist faith throughout Asia and as far as the Mediterranean Basin. The contemporary stone inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka also relate this activity in detail.

Following these efforts, the Buddhist faith seems to have expanded among Greek communities under the rule of Ashoka, and tens of thousands were converted. About 50 years laters, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom invaded North India as far as Pāṭaliputra and founded the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Maurya Empire and to protect Buddhism from the religious persecutions of the new Shunga Empire (185–73 BCE). Greek Buddhist monks continued to play a key role during the time of Menander, as far as Sri Lanka.

==Greek monks under Ashoka==
According to Edicts of Ashoka, Greek populations (generally described in ancient times throughout the Classical world as Yona, Yojanas or Yavanas, lit. &quot;Ionians&quot; ) were under his rule in northwestern India.

Far from just being on the receiving end of conversion to Buddhism, the Mahavamsa indicates that Greeks took an active and crucial role in spreading the Buddhist faith as emissaries of Ashoka.

These Greek missionaries appear in the list of the &quot;elders&quot; (Pali: &quot;thera&quot;) sent far and wide by Emperor Ashoka:

:&quot;When the thera Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror, had brought the (third) council to an end (…) he sent forth theras, one here and one there:
:* The thera Mahyantika he sent to Kasmira and Gandhara,
:* The thera, MaMdeva he sent to Mahisamandala.
:* To Vanavasa be sent the thera named Rakkhita,
:* and to Aparantaka (he sent) the Yona named Dhammarakkhita;
:* to Maharattha (he sent) the thera named Mahadhammarakkhita,
:* but the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the country of the Yona.
:* He sent the thera Majjhima to the Himalaya country,
:* and to Suvambhurni he sent the two theras Sona and Uttara.
:* The great thera Mahinda, the theras Utthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his disciples, these five theras he sent forth with the charge: `Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka the lovely religion of the Conqueror.&#x27;&quot; (Mahavamsa, XII)

===Dharmaraksita===

Dhammarakkhita (Dharmaraksita in Sanskrit), was the Yona (Lit. &quot;Ionian&quot; or &quot;Greek&quot;) leader of the mission to Aparantaka.

The country of Aparantaka has been identified as the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, and comprises Northern Gujarat, Kathiawar, Kachch, and Sindh, the area where Greek communities were probably concentrated. To this day, a city in Gujarat is named Junagadh, originally &quot;Yonagadh&quot;, lit. &quot;City of the Greeks&quot;.

Dharmarashita is said to have preached the Aggikkhandopama Sutta, so that 37,000 people were converted in Aparantaka and that thousands of men and women entered the Order (Mahavimsa XII).

According to the Milinda Panha (I 32-35), the monk Nagasena, who famously dialogued with the Greek king Menander I to convert him to Buddhism, was a student of Dharmaraksita, and he reached enlightenment as an arhat under his guidance.

===Mahyantika===
The thera (“elder”) Mahyantika was sent to Kashmir and Gandhara, also areas with strong Hellenic presence. Although he is not identified as Greek in the Mahavamsa, his name probably means Maha (great) + Antika (Antiochos), a common Greek first name.

===Maharaksita===
The thera (“elder”) Maharakkhita (Maharaksita in Sanskrit) is said to have been sent to the country of the Greeks. He would probably have been Greek as well due to the nature of his mission, but this is unconfirmed.

==Greek monks under Menander==
The Indo-Greek king Menander I (reigned 160- 135 BCE) had his capital in Sagala, in today’s northern Punjab, and is described by Strabo as one of the most powerful Greek kings of the period, even greater than Alexander the Great.

Menander probably converted to Buddhism, and seems to have encouraged the spread of the faith within the Indian subcontinent, and possibly into Central Asia as well. A documented example of the influence of a Greek Buddhist monk is found in the Mahavamsa again:

===Mahadharmaraksita===
During the time of Menander I, the Yona (Ionian) Mahadhammarakkhita () is said to have come from “Alasandra” (thought to be Alexandria of the Caucasus, the city founded by Alexander the Great, near today’s Kabul) with 30,000 monks for the foundation ceremony of the Maha Thupa (&quot;Great stupa&quot;) at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, during the 2nd century BCE.

:&quot;From Alasanda the city of the Yonas came the thera Yona Mahadhammarakkhita with thirty thousand bhikkhus.&quot; (Mahavamsa, XXIX)

These elements tend to indicate the importance of Buddhism within Greek communities in northwestern India, and the prominent role Greek Buddhist monks played in them, as well as throughout the Indian subcontinent and possibly as far as the Mediterranean, during the last centuries before the current era.

<doc id="978525" wikidata="Q2979818" url="?curid=978525" title="Marc Emery">
<text>Marc Scott Emery (born February 13, 1958) is a Canadian cannabis rights activist, entrepreneur and politician. Often described as the &quot;Prince of Pot&quot;, Emery has been a notable advocate of international cannabis policy reform, and has been active in multiple Canadian political parties at the provincial and federal levels. Emery has been jailed several times for his cannabis activism.

He is the estranged spouse of fellow activist Jodie Emery, with whom he operated Cannabis Culture magazine and Pot TV. Until the business was raided by police, the couple were co-owners of Cannabis Culture, a business that franchised pot dispensaries. Crown prosecutors later deemed the business to be illegal due to obtaining cannabis from illegal sources.

==Early life==
At the age of 9, Emery started a business from his parents&#x27; home called Stamp Treasure, buying and selling stamps by mail order. Two years later he started another mail-order business called Marc&#x27;s Comic Room that he started by using the money saved from Stamp Treasure. The business sold used comic books and earned him about $120 a week.

He dropped out of high school in 1975 at age 17 to purchase a used book store in London, Ontario which he renamed City Lights Bookshop. Emery operated the store for 17 years, selling it in 1992.

==Businesses==
===Hemp BC===
Emery moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in March 1994, and founded Hemp BC, a store selling cannabis-related paraphernalia. Bongs and pipes were illegal to sell or promote in Canada and were not readily available at the time.

In late 1994, a court challenge sponsored by Emery convinced an Ontario judge to overturn the Canadian prohibition on marijuana and drug-related literature, making it legal for &quot;High Times&quot; magazine and marijuana grow books to be sold in Canada once more. Emery began selling seeds after attending the &quot;High Times&quot; Cannabis Cup. The business was featured on the front page of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1995. In early 1995 he launched &quot;Cannabis Canada Magazine&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Cannabis Culture&quot; magazine in 1998.

The store was raided twice in 1996 and 1997. Emery received charges relating to illegal sales of paraphanelia and seeds, as well as assaulting a police officer. He was later convicted and given a $2,200 fine for the sales and jail time for the assault. Emery was also banned from returning to the 300 block of West Hastings, where his businesses were located.

The store was repeatedly raided through 1998 after its sale to the store manager. Her business licence was subsequently revoked by the city. In August 1998, Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen had told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Hemp BC was &quot;going to be toast by September.&quot; Emery switched his walk-in marijuana seed business to mail-order only, and continued to publish &quot;Cannabis Culture&quot; magazine. In early 2000 he established Pot-TV, a marijuana-related video channel. From 1998 until his arrest in 2005, Emery paid provincial and federal taxes as a &quot;marijuana seed vendor&quot; totalling nearly $600,000.

===Cannabis Culture===
On December 15, 2016, Marc and Jodie Emery opened six illegal Cannabis Culture marijuana &quot;dispensaries&quot; in Montreal, Quebec as an act of &quot;civil disobedience&quot;. On 16 December 2016, Marc Emery was arrested at the Mont-Royal Avenue store, during a series of raids conducted by the Montreal police. Jodie Emery was released later that night with no charges, while Marc was held overnight. Following this arrest, Emery continued to open dispensary franchises in cities such as Hamilton and Ottawa. At one time, a total of 19 Cannabis Culture dispensaries were in operation in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

==Political activity==
Emery worked on the New Democratic Party&#x27;s campaign in London East in the 1979 federal election. He was a critic of slow police response times to robberies, advocating for private security officers for merchants and business owners. He started a campaign to eliminate the annual levy tax of $35 a year for downtown improvements, stating that it favoured a handful of the elite. He ran for the Libertarian Party of Canada in the 1980 federal election, finishing fourth in London East.

Emery later left the Libertarians and became a London-area organizer for the libertarian Unparty, later renamed the Freedom Party of Ontario. Emery served as the Freedom Party&#x27;s Action Director from 1984 to 1990. In 1984, Emery, the Freedom Party, and the No Tax for Pan-Am Games Committee (founded by Emery and Metz) successfully campaigned against London&#x27;s bid for the 1991 Pan American Games, saying the city would lose millions. Emery ran as a candidate of the Freedom Party in the rural constituency of Middlesex, near London, Ontario in the 1987 provincial election. He received 499 votes for a distant fifth-place finish.

In 1982 and 1985, Emery unsuccessfully ran for Alderman in Ward 3 of London, Ontario. In May 1987 during a strike by city workers, Emery paid for truck rentals and volunteers to do the jobs of the striking workers. This caused outrage, leading to the strikers threatening to dump garbage on Emery&#x27;s front lawn.

He ran for mayor of the city of Vancouver in 1996, 2002 and 2008.

In 2000 he was a founding member of the Marijuana Party of Canada. Emery ran for the Canadian House of Commons as a Marijuana Party Candidate in the 2000 federal election. In 2001 he helped found the British Columbia Marijuana Party (BCMP). The BCMP placed fifth in the 2001 provincial election. Emery has been the BC Marijuana Party&#x27;s president since its founding, and also became party leader in 2003, when Dana Larsen resigned to join the NDP.

In 2003, when the prohibition of cannabis in Canada was in limbo, Emery launched &quot;the Summer of Legalization&quot; tour, travelling to 18 cities across Canada to openly smoke marijuana in front of police stations.

In November 2003, Emery endorsed NDP leader Jack Layton during an interview with Layton on the &quot;Pot TV&quot; program. In the 2005 British Columbia election, Emery ran for the BC Marijuana Party, but was defeated. He endorsed Svend Robinson&#x27;s candidacy in Vancouver Centre during the 2006 federal election campaign.

In the 2009 BC provincial election, Emery supported the Green Party of British Columbia. His wife, Jodie Emery, was the BC Green candidate in Vancouver-Fraserview. She had sought the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination in Vancouver East for the 2015 federal election, however, her candidacy was disallowed by the party. The Liberal Party, which had campaigned on cannabis legalization, secured a majority in the election and legalized cannabis in 2018 with the &quot;Cannabis Act&quot;.

Marc Emery endorsed Maxime Bernier&#x27;s candidacy for the leadership of the federal Conservative Party in 2016 and announced his intention to join the Conservatives in order to vote for Bernier, due to the candidate&#x27;s libertarian platform. In the 2019 Canadian federal election, he supported the People&#x27;s Party of Canada (PPC), which Bernier founded after leaving the Conservative Party. He ran for the PPC in London North Centre during the 2021 election, finishing in fourth place with 5% of the vote.

==Legal issues==
US government officials have described Emery as a drug dealer for his efforts to sell marijuana seeds in Canada and abroad.

===1991 obscenity charges===
In 1991, Emery was convicted for selling copies of 2 Live Crew&#x27;s rap CD &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot; which had been deemed obscene and banned in Ontario. He was given one year&#x27;s probation, but immediately after sentencing he began selling marijuana-related literature and &quot;High Times&quot; magazine, all in violation of Canadian law. Emery invited local police to his store to arrest him, but the police refused to charge him or interfere. He also sponsored visits from marijuana activists including Ed Rosenthal, Steven Hager, Jack Herer and Paul Mavrides.

===1998 Entrapment===
Court documents showed that four American Navy undercover agents attempted to buy marijuana and smoke it at the Vancouver Cannabis Cafe in April 1998. The documents showed the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents worked in a joint operation with Vancouver police. Emery was convicted on charges of selling marijuana seeds in 1998, and received a $2,000 fine.

===2004 trafficking conviction===
On August 19, 2004, Emery was sentenced to 92 days in jail in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Emery had been convicted of trafficking because a witness saw him pass a joint in March 2004. Emery&#x27;s supporters held an ongoing daily vigil outside the courthouse until he was released. On October 18 he was released from the Saskatoon correctional centre after serving 61 days of his sentence.

===2005 arrest and extradition===
On July 29, 2005, Canadian police, acting on a request from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), simultaneously raided the BC Marijuana Party Bookstore and Headquarters in Vancouver and arrested Emery for extradition to the United States outside a storefront in Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia.

American authorities charged Emery and co-defendants Gregory Keith Williams and Michelle Rainey-Fenkarek with &quot;&#x27;Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana Seeds&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering&quot;. Even though all the alleged offences occurred in Canada, Canadian police did not lay any charges.

The day of Emery&#x27;s arrest, American DEA Administrator Karen Tandy made a public statement asserting that the arrest was &quot;a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, but also to the marijuana legalization movement.&quot; Emery was freed on a $50,000 bail.
Emery and his two associates, all charged in the United States with drug and money laundering offences, each faced a minimum 10-year sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment if convicted there. On January 14, 2008, Emery agreed to a tentative plea-bargain with U.S. authorities. The terms of the agreement were a 5-year prison term to be served in both Canadian and U.S. prisons. In return, he demanded the charges against his associates be dropped. On March 27, 2008 the plea-bargain deal collapsed because of the refusal of the Canadian government to approve its side of the arrangement. Emery agreed to plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution and accept a five-year sentence in the USA.

During Emery&#x27;s 45 day incarceration while awaiting extradition to a US federal prison, his supporters held a continuous vigil outside the prison with tents and banners, ending when Emery was released on bail. On May 10, 2010, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson signed the order for Emery to surrender to authorities, which he did that same day. On May 20, 2010, Emery was extradited to the United States, pleading guilty on May 24 to one count of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana. On September 10, 2010, Emery was sentenced to 5 years in prison minus time served. While at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, Washington Emery was locked in a Segregated Housing Unit (SHU) for three weeks as a result of allowing his wife to record a message from him over the phone.

On June 30, 2014, Emery announced his pending release in a blog post on the Cannabis Culture website. On July 9, 2014, he was released, having served just over four years of his five-year sentence having earned 235 days of good conduct credit.

===Project Gator===
Marc and Jodie Emery were again arrested at Toronto Pearson International Airport on March 8, 2017. He faced 15 charges, including conspiracy to commit an indictable offence, trafficking, possession for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of proceeds of crime. Jodie Emery faced five similar counts. On March 9, 2017, search warrants were given in Toronto, Hamilton, and Vancouver as part of &quot;Project Gator&quot; a Toronto Police Service project that targeted marijuana dispensaries. This was in reaction to Acting Inspector Steve Watts allegations of Cannabis Culture having ties to organized crime. Five dispensaries in Toronto, one in Hamilton, one in Vancouver, and another in Ottawa were raided and shut down. Police seized $250,000 in cash in several different currencies. The police also searched two homes in Toronto, one in Stoney Creek, Ontario, and one in Vancouver that all had ties to Emery&#x27;s Cannabis Culture franchise. Some of the dispensaries reopened the next day. On March 10, Marc and Jodie were granted bail, with conditions limiting or banning their access to marijuana and Cannabis Culture franchises. After a guilty plea, the couple was convicted of drug-related charges on December 18, 2017, fined and placed on two years probation. Three other individuals were also convicted of drug-related charges. The couple had claimed that the operation of pot shops was a form of civil disobedience, but Justice Leslie Chapin ruled as follows: &quot;No doubt there were pro-social motivations that were behind the actions, but at the same time, I have to recognize that much profit was made&quot;.

==Non-marijuana activism==
As a political libertarian, Emery has also protested against Sunday shopping laws, obscenity laws, political endorsement of sporting events, Canadian censorship, and several taxes.

In 2002, Emery founded the Iboga Therapy House, an ibogaine-assisted detoxification therapy program located on British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast. Emery and his staff offered free ibogaine therapy to volunteer heroin and cocaine addicts with a plant-based alkaloid called ibogaine, which has been claimed to help people quit addictions.

On October 12, 1997, Marc Emery was featured on &quot;CNN Impact&quot; in an episode called &quot;Canada Cannabis.&quot; The announcer referred to Emery as the &quot;Prince of Pot&quot; and the label stuck.

In 2001, Emery was a featured presenter at Idea City, an annual gathering of notable Canadians organized by Moses Znaimer. In November 2002, Emery and his guests heckled then US drug czar John Walters during his speech at a luncheon sponsored by the Vancouver Board of Trade.

Emery is featured in the 2007 CBC documentary film &quot;Prince of Pot: The US vs. Marc Emery&quot;, and CBC Doc Zone episode &quot;Cannabiz.&quot; He also appears in a 2007 documentary called The Union: The Business Behind Getting High, and the 2007 comedy documentary &quot;Super High Me&quot;. Emery was the focus of the 2013 feature documentary, Citizen Marc.

==Sexual harassment allegations==
In January 2019, several women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Emery. These allegations were denied by Emery in several Facebook posts. As a result of these allegations, Emery was pulled as the keynote speaker from the First International Cannabis Seminar held in Argentina in February 2019. Prior to his removal, two Argentine politicians and a journalist cancelled their appearances in protest of Emery&#x27;s presence at the conference. Shortly after, the Legalized Summit in Vancouver withdrew Emery&#x27;s nomination for a lifetime achievement award and removed his estranged wife Jodie as a speaker.

<text>Paul Zindel Jr. (May 15, 1936 – March 27, 2003) was an American playwright, young adult novelist, and educator.

==Early life==

Zindel was born in Tottenville, Staten Island, New York, to Paul Zindel Sr., a policeman, and Betty Zindel, a nurse; his sister, Betty (Zindel) Hagen, was a year and a half older than him. Paul Zindel Sr. ran away with his mistress when Zindel was two, leaving the trio to move around Staten Island, living in various houses and apartments.

Zindel wrote his first play in high school. Throughout his teen years, he wrote plays, though he trained as a chemist at Wagner College and spent six months working at Allied Chemical as a chemical writer after graduating. Zindel took a creative-writing course with the playwright Edward Albee while he was an undergraduate. Albee became his mentor and was an advocate for Zindel. He later quit and worked as a high-school Chemistry and Physics teacher at Tottenville High School on Staten Island for ten years. Zindel seemed to gravitate toward behavior that allowed him to observe the reactions of others in strange situations: Olen Soifer, visiting with his father Dave, who was the long-time lab technician at the high school, remembers seeing Zindel wearing black shoes with the front of one cut off, such that his white-socked toes could not be missed sticking out of the shoe.

==Career==
In 1964, he wrote &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;, his first and most successful play. The play ran off-Broadway in 1970, and on Broadway in 1971, and he received the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. However, this play also received criticism for being too elliptical or too difficult to understand. Still, it was also made into a 1972 movie by 20th Century Fox, directed by Paul Newman and starring his wife Joanne Woodward. Soon thereafter, Charlotte Zolotow, a vice-president at Harper &amp; Row, contacted him about writing for her publishing house.

Zindel wrote a total of 53 books, all but one of them aimed at children or teens. Many were set in his home town of Staten Island. They tended to be semi-autobiographical, focusing on teenage misfits with abusive or neglectful parents. Zindel himself grew up in a single-parent household; his mother worked at various occupations: hat-check girl, shipyard worker, dog breeder, hot-dog vendor, and finally, licensed practical nurse, often boarding terminally ill patients at their home. They moved frequently, and his mother often engaged in &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; schemes that did not succeed. His father abandoned them early in his life. This upbringing was most closely depicted in &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Baboon&quot;.

Despite the often dark subject matter of his books, which deal with loneliness, loss, and the effects of abuse, they are also filled with humor. Many of his novels have zany titles, such as &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot;, &quot;Pardon Me, You&#x27;re Stepping on My Eyeball!&quot; or &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Baboon&quot;. &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot; specifically deals with teen sexuality, abuse within the home, teen pregnancy, and abortion.

&quot;The Pigman&quot;, first published in 1968, deals with love and finding friends in odd places. It is widely taught in American schools and made it onto the list of most frequently banned books in America in the 1990s; for example, Plano, Texas parents complained of offensive language and sexual themes. Zindel stated that &quot;I ignore critics usually. I believe the perfect story is a dream.&quot;

Zindel received the annual Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association in 2002, recognizing his cumulative &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. The jury cited five works said to be published 1968 to 1993: &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;; &quot;My Darling, My Hamburger&quot;; and the Pigman trilogy. The citation called &quot;The Pigman&quot; &quot;one of the first authentic young adult novels&quot; and the panel chair observed that &quot;Paul Zindel knows and understands the reality young adults deal with day-to-day ... He has the ability to depict young adults in an honest and realistic way. The characters he developed nearly 40 years ago still speak to today&#x27;s teens.&quot;

Beginning with &quot;Loch&quot; in 1994, Zindel wrote numerous speculative fiction novels for children or young adults, mainly in the horror genre.

Zindel also worked in Hollywood, writing the screenplays for, among other titles, Up the Sandbox, &quot;Mame&quot; and Runaway Train&quot;.&quot; 

==Personal life and death==
Zindel was married to Bonnie Hildebrand from 1973, divorcing her in 1998. They had two children; novelist Lizabeth Zindel, and son David, a publisher. 

A resident of Montague Township, New Jersey, Zindel died in New York City from lung cancer in 2003, at the Jacob Perlow Hospice in Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He is buried in Moravian Cemetery, Staten Island.

<text>Taruntius is a lunar impact crater on the northwestern edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after ancient Roman philosopher, mathematician and astrologer Lucius Tarutius Firmanus. To the northwest is the lava-flooded crater Lawrence, and to the north lie the craters Watts and da Vinci.

==Description==
The surface about Taruntius has an unusual number of ghost craters and lava-flooded features, especially to the southwest in the Mare Fecunditatis.

The outer rim of Taruntius is shallow, but forms a veined, complex rampart in the nearby mare, especially to the north and southwest. The rim is broken in the northwest by the small crater Cameron. The inner rim face lacks s, but in the interior is an unusual concentric inner rim that is heavily worn and irregular. This is a floor-fractured crater, possibly created by an uplift of mare material from beneath the interior. There is a low central peak complex in the middle of the relatively flat interior floor. There are also some slender rilles that are concentric to the rim.

The crater has a pair of faint dark patches. One patch is located just south of the central peak and the other falls on the sides of the northern rim near Cameron. These were likely created by deposits of volcanic ash from small vents. Taruntius has a ray system with a radius of over 300 kilometers. Due to these rays, Taruntius has been mapped as part of the Copernican System, but this dating has been disputed.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Taruntius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Taruntius A — &quot;See&quot; Asada crater.
* Taruntius C — &quot;See&quot; Cameron crater.
* Taruntius D — &quot;See&quot; Watts crater.
* Taruntius E — &quot;See&quot; Zähringer crater.
* Taruntius G — &quot;See&quot; Anville crater.
* Taruntius M — &quot;See&quot; Lawrence crater.
* Taruntius N — &quot;See&quot; Smithson crater.

<doc id="978548" wikidata="Q1508098" url="?curid=978548" title="Yerkes (crater)">
<text>Yerkes is a lunar impact crater near the western edge of Mare Crisium. It was named after American financier Charles Yerkes. To the east of Yerkes is the crater Picard, and farther to the north is Peirce.

In the past the interior of Yerkes has been almost completely inundated by lava, leaving only a shallow remnant of a rim above the mare. The rim is widest on the western and southern portions, and barely existent to the east, forming a thin curve in the surface. A low ridge runs from the north rim to Yerkes E in the north-northwest. The floor has a similar albedo to the nearby mare, so the feature is not sharply distinguished from the surroundings.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Yerkes.

<doc id="978554" wikidata="Q2063829" url="?curid=978554" title="Mitzvah tank">
<text>A Mitzvah tank is a vehicle used by the Orthodox Jewish practitioners of Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidism as a portable &quot;educational and outreach center&quot; and &quot;mini-synagogue&quot; (or &quot;minagogue&quot;) to reach out to non-observant and alienated Jews. Mitzvah tanks have been commonplace on the streets of New York City since 1974. Today they are found all over the globe in countries where Chabad is active.

==Terminology==

The word Mitzvah means a &quot;commandment&quot; of the Torah in Judaism, but also carries with it the connotation of a good deed. Lubavitchers use these vehicles to spread the teachings of Judaism to the Jewish masses in &quot;military fashion&quot; in which &quot;campaigns&quot; and battles are fought, hence naming the vans and trucks &quot;tanks&quot;.

The strategy behind the Mitzvah tank &quot;campaigns&quot; was designed and encouraged by the seventh rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson .

==Appearance and description==

Mitzvah tanks can be vans, travel trailers, recreational vehicles, campervan or pickup trucks. On Sukkot, vehicles may be fitted with a portable Sukkah (the Sukkah-mobile). Mitzvah tanks are put into operation on the eve of major Jewish holidays and Fridays prior to Shabbat. The vehicles often have large banners or logos on them, extolling some aspect of Judaism or displaying images of Rabbi Schneerson and about Moshiach&#x27;s imminent arrival. Some Mitzvah Tanks have external speakers attached which are used to play klezmer-style music. The tanks, usually manned by young male Lubavitch students in the Yeshiva of Tomchei Temimim, park in areas with heavy people-traffic and seek Jews to perform &quot;Mitzvahs&quot; by asking passers-by: &quot;Are you Jewish?&quot;

==Purpose==

Lubavitchers manning the tank will usually hand out brochures or cards with information about performing &quot;mitzvot&quot; and about the coming of Moshiach. They encourage passersby to perform mitzvot with an emphasis on those part of the Chabad mitzvah campaigns, and assist those who are willing to perform religious rituals, such as the putting on of Tefillin (phylacteries) with men and boys over Bar Mitzvah, and hand out candles and candle-lighting information to women and girls to light in honor of the Shabbat. In addition, during the holiday of Chanukah many Menorahs with candles are given out allowing people to bring the light of Chanukah into their own home, all in bringing the ultimate Moshiach closer. Some Mitzvah Tanks have traditional foods, like doughnuts, on board during that holiday as well.

<doc id="978557" wikidata="Q3376951" url="?curid=978557" title="John R. Brinkley">
<text>John Romulus Brinkley (later John Richard Brinkley; July 8, 1885 – May 26, 1942) was an American quack doctor, broadcaster, marketer and independent politician. He had no accredited education as a physician and bought his medical degree from a diploma mill. Brinkley became known as the &quot;goat-gland doctor&quot; after he achieved national fame, international notoriety, and wealth through the xenotransplantation of goat testicles into humans. Although Brinkley initially promoted this procedure as a means of curing male impotence, he later claimed that the technique was a virtual panacea for a wide range of male ailments. Brinkley operated clinics and hospitals in several states and was able to continue practicing medicine for almost two decades, despite his techniques being thoroughly discredited by the broader medical community.

He was also an advertising and radio pioneer who began the era of Mexican border blaster radio.

Although he was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Kansas and several other states, Brinkley, a demagogue beloved by hundreds of thousands of people in Kansas and elsewhere, nevertheless launched two campaigns for Kansas governor, one of which was nearly successful. Brinkley&#x27;s rise to fame and fortune was as quick as his eventual fall was precipitous. At the height of his career, he had amassed millions of dollars, but he died nearly penniless as a result of the large number of malpractice, wrongful death, and fraud suits brought against him.

==Early life==
Brinkley was born to John Richard Brinkley, a poor mountain man who practiced medicine in North Carolina and served as a medic for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Brinkley senior&#x27;s first marriage was annulled because he was underage. After he reached adulthood, he married four more times and outlived each of his wives. In 1870, at the age of 42, he married Sarah T. Mingus. Later, the 24-year-old niece of Mingus, Sarah Candice Burnett, moved into the house. The family called Brinkley&#x27;s wife &quot;Sally&quot; to differentiate between the two Sarahs. Sarah Burnett gave birth out of wedlock to John Romulus Brinkley in the town of Beta, in Jackson County, North Carolina, naming her son after his father, and after Romulus, the mythical twin suckled by wolves. Sarah Burnett died of pneumonia and tuberculosis when Brinkley was five. Sarah T. &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; and John Brinkley moved with Sarah Burnett&#x27;s child to East LaPorte within the same county, near the Tuckasegee River. The family had little money during this time.

John Richard Brinkley died when his son was ten years old. The young Brinkley attended a one-room log cabin school in the Tuckasegee area, held each year during three or four months of winter. There, Brinkley met Sally Margaret Wike, the daughter of a well-off school board member. Brinkley finished his studies at 16 and began to work carrying mail between local towns, and to learn how to use a telegraph. He wished, however, to become a doctor.

==Family and education==
As a telegrapher, Brinkley went to New York City to work for Western Union, after which he moved to New Jersey to work at one, then another, railway company. In late 1906, he returned home to Aunt Sally after hearing that she was unwell. She died on December 25, 1906. Afterward, he was comforted by Sally Wike, age 22 and one year older than Brinkley. They married on January 27, 1907, in Sylva, North Carolina. They traveled around posing as Quaker doctors, giving rural towns a medicine show where they hawked a patent medicine. Brinkley&#x27;s next move was to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he played right-hand man, helping hawk virility &quot;tonics&quot; with a man named Dr. Burke.

In 1907, Brinkley settled with his wife in Chicago, where they celebrated the birth of their daughter Wanda Marion Brinkley on November 5. John Brinkley then enrolled at Bennett Medical College, an unaccredited school with curricula focused on eclectic medicine. Brinkley worked for Western Union as a telegrapher at night and attended classes during the day, while debts mounted from tuition, the cost of raising a family, and from Sally&#x27;s self-centered whims. In 1908, the Brinkleys buried an infant son who had lived only three days.

At school, Brinkley was introduced to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system. He determined that this new field would help move his career forward. After two years of studies, and ever-deeper debts, Brinkley doubled his summer workload by taking two shifts at Western Union, but came home one day to find his wife and daughter gone. Sally filed for divorce and child support, but after two months of payments, Brinkley kidnapped his daughter and fled with her to Canada. Sally Brinkley, unable to obtain an extradition order from Canada, dismissed her suit for alimony and child support, allowing Brinkley to return to Chicago with the child where the couple reunited in marriage.

In 1911, before Brinkley was finished with his third year of studies, Sally left him again, and bore him another daughter, Erna Maxine Brinkley, on July 11, 1911, back home in the Tuckasegee area. Brinkley left Chicago and his unpaid tuition bills to return to North Carolina and join his family. There, he began working as an &quot;undergraduate physician&quot;, but failed to establish himself. He moved his family around to different towns in Florida and North Carolina, &quot;packing up and going all the time from one place to another&quot;.

===Diploma mill===
In 1912, Brinkley left his family to try to regain the thread of his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his scholastic records to any of the medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.

Brinkley set up a storefront business in Greenville, South Carolina, with a man named James E. Crawford (using the alias J. W. Burks). The two opened their shop as the &quot;Greenville Electro Medic Doctors&quot;, and placed advertisements to attract men who were concerned about their manly vigor. They injected colored water into their patients at $25 a shot (), telling them it was Salvarsan or &quot;electric medicine from Germany&quot;. After two months, the partners hurriedly left town with unpaid rent and utility bills, as well as debts for clothing and pharmaceutical supplies. The local newspaper reported that the duo left about 30 to 40 local merchants with unpaid checks. They ended up where Crawford had once lived, in Memphis, Tennessee.

===Second marriage===
In Memphis, Brinkley met 21-year-old Minerva Telitha &quot;Minnie&quot; Jones, a friend of Crawford&#x27;s and the daughter of a local physician. On August 23, 1913, after a four-day courtship, Brinkley and Jones married at the Peabody Hotel, even though he was still married to Sally Brinkley. Minnie and John Brinkley honeymooned in Kansas City, Denver, Pocatello and Knoxville. Brinkley was arrested in Knoxville and extradited to Greenville where he was put in jail for practicing medicine without a license and for writing bad checks. Brinkley told the sheriff that it was all Crawford&#x27;s fault, and gave investigators enough information that they were able to arrest Crawford in Pocatello. The two former partners met again in jail. Brinkley and Minerva had a son, John, who would commit suicide in the 1970s.

Brinkley and Crawford decided to settle out of court with Greenville&#x27;s angry merchants for a sum of several thousand dollars, most of which Crawford paid. Brinkley&#x27;s new father-in-law paid Brinkley&#x27;s bail, but only contributed $200 to his fraudulent debt settlement (). Brinkley rejoined Minnie Brinkley in Memphis. There, Sally Brinkley confronted the couple, informing Minnie Brinkley that her husband was a bigamist. Minnie and John Brinkley moved to Judsonia, Arkansas, where he again obtained an &quot;undergraduate license&quot; to practice medicine, advertising his specialty as &quot;diseases of women and children&quot;. He made little profit, and joined the Army Reserve Medical Corps.

Brinkley accepted an offer to take over the office of another doctor who was moving out of state. Brinkley began to turn a modest profit, and was finally able to pay Bennett Medical University the amount owed for tuition. In October 1914, the Brinkleys moved to Kansas City where he enrolled at that city&#x27;s Eclectic Medical University to finish out his last year remaining of the education he started at Bennett. After studying the irritations and enlargements of the prostate gland in elderly men, and paying the university $100 (), Brinkley graduated on May 7, 1915. His diploma from Eclectic allowed him to practice medicine in eight states. While in Kansas City, Brinkley took a job as the doctor for the Swift and Company plant, patching minor wounds and studying animal physiology. It was here that Brinkley learned that popular opinion held that the healthiest animal slaughtered at the plant was the goat, something that would prove pivotal to his later medical career.

To resolve the possibility of his bigamy being exposed, Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally, which he did in December 1915. To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly, he wrote that they had been married in New York City, and that he did not know her new place of residence. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri. Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage.

In 1917, Brinkley, now an Army Reservist, was called up for service during World War I. However, he only served a little over two months, most of the duration of which he was sick with a nervous breakdown, before being discharged. In October of the same year, Brinkley and his wife moved to Milford, Kansas, after having spotted a newspaper advertisement saying the town needed a doctor.

==Goat gland transplantation==
In 1918, Brinkley opened a 16-room clinic in Milford, where he won over the locals immediately by paying good wages, invigorating the local economy, and making house calls on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic. For all his later infamy as a charlatan, accounts of his success at nursing flu victims back to health, and the lengths to which he went to treat them, were resoundingly positive.

As recounted in the biography that Brinkley had commissioned, he struck upon the idea of transplanting goat testicles into men when a patient came to him to ask if he could fix someone who was &quot;sexually weak&quot;. Brinkley responded by joking that the patient would have no problem if he had &quot;a pair of those buck [goat] glands in you&quot;. The patient then begged Brinkley to try the operation, which Brinkley did, for $150. (The patient&#x27;s son later told &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; that Brinkley had in fact offered to pay his father &quot;handsomely&quot; if he&#x27;d go along with the experiment.)

At his clinic, Brinkley began to perform more operations he claimed would restore male virility and fertility through implanting the testicular glands of goats in his male patients at a cost of $750 per operation (). Following one of his crude operations, the body of a patient would typically absorb the goat tissue as foreign matter. The goat gonads failed to engraft into the body, as they were simply placed within the human male scrotum or the abdomen of women, near the ovaries.

In light of his questionable medical training (75 percent completion at a less-than-reputable medical school), frequency of operating while intoxicated and less-than-sterile operating environments, some patients suffered from infection, and an undetermined number died. Brinkley would be sued more than a dozen times for wrongful death between 1930 and 1941.

Soon after Brinkley opened up shop, he scored an advertising coup that made major newspapers come calling: the wife of his first goat gland transplantation patient gave birth to a baby boy. Brinkley began promoting goat glands as a cure for 27 ailments, ranging from dementia to emphysema to flatulence. He started a direct mail blitz and hired an advertising agent, who helped Brinkley portray his treatments as turning hapless men into &quot;the ram that am with every lamb&quot;. His burst of publicity—and his stratospheric claims—attracted the attention of the American Medical Association, which sent an agent to the clinic to investigate undercover. The agent found a woman hobbling around Brinkley&#x27;s clinic who had been given goat ovaries as a cure for a spinal cord tumor. From then on, Brinkley was on the AMA&#x27;s radar, including catching the eye of the doctor who would eventually be responsible for his downfall, Morris Fishbein, who made his career exposing medical frauds.

At the same time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, including Serge Voronoff, who had become known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors at a hospital in Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not to be confused with the University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.

In 1922, Brinkley traveled to Los Angeles at the invitation of Harry Chandler, owner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who challenged Brinkley to transplant goat testicles into one of his editors. If the operation was a success, Chandler wrote, he would make Brinkley the &quot;most famous surgeon in America&quot;, and if not then he should consider himself &quot;damned&quot;. California didn&#x27;t recognize Brinkley&#x27;s license to practice medicine from the Eclectic Medical University, but Chandler pulled some strings and got him a 30-day permit. The operation was judged a success, and Brinkley received his promised attention in Chandler&#x27;s paper, which sent many new customers Brinkley&#x27;s way, including some Hollywood film stars. Brinkley was so taken with the city—and all the money it represented in the form of potential patients—that he began making plans to relocate his clinic there. But his hopes were dashed when the California medical board denied his application for a permanent license to practice medicine, having found his resume &quot;riddled with lies and discrepancies&quot; (most of which were discovered and pointed out to the board by Fishbein). Brinkley returned to Kansas undaunted and began to expand his clinic in Milford.

Brinkley&#x27;s activities inspired the film industry term &#x27;goat gland&#x27;—the grafting of talkie sequences onto silent films to make them marketable.

===Brinkley&#x27;s first radio station===
While in Los Angeles, Brinkley toured KHJ, a radio station Chandler owned. He immediately saw the power radio held as an advertising and marketing medium and resolved to build his own to promote his services, even though at the time advertising on public airwaves was very much discouraged. By 1923, he had enough capital to build KFKB (&quot;Kansas First, Kansas Best&quot; or sometimes &quot;Kansas Folks Know Best&quot;) using a 1 kilowatt transmitter. That same year, the &quot;St. Louis Star&quot; published a scathing expose of medical diploma mills, and in 1924, the &quot;Kansas City Journal-Post&quot; followed suit, bringing unwelcome attention Brinkley&#x27;s way. In July 1924, a grand jury in San Francisco handed down 19 indictments to people responsible for conferring fake medical degrees, and for some doctors who received them. Brinkley was one, due mostly to his questionable application for a California medical license. When agents from California came to arrest Brinkley, the governor of Kansas, Jonathan M. Davis, refused to extradite him because he made the state too much money. Brinkley took to his radio station&#x27;s airwaves to crow about his victory over the American Medical Association and Fishbein, who by this time had started giving speeches and writing articles for the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (&quot;JAMA&quot;) deriding Brinkley and his treatments as quackery. His gland business made more money than ever, and had begun attracting patients from around the globe.

Brinkley spoke for hours on end each day on the radio, primarily promoting his goat gland treatments. He variously cajoled, shamed, and appealed to men&#x27;s (and women&#x27;s) egos, and to their desire to be more sexually active. In between Brinkley&#x27;s own advertisements, his new station featured a variety of entertainment including military bands, French lessons, astrological forecasts, storytelling and exotica such as native Hawaiian songs, and American roots music including old-time string band, gospel, and early country.

The advertising boost his radio station gave him was enormous, and Milford benefited as well; Brinkley paid for a new sewage system and sidewalks, installed electricity, built a bandstand and apartments for his patients and employees, as well as a new post office to handle all of his mail. He was named an &quot;admiral&quot; in the Kansas Navy and sponsored a hometown baseball team called the Brinkley Goats.

Eager for better credentials, in 1925 Brinkley traveled to Europe searching for honorary degrees. After being rebuffed by several institutes in the United Kingdom, Brinkley found a willing suitor in the University of Pavia in Italy. Fishbein and Brinkley&#x27;s former teacher, Max Thorek, heard about the degree and pressured the Italian government to rescind it. Benito Mussolini himself revoked the degree, though Brinkley claimed it until he died. Fishbein&#x27;s interest in putting Brinkley out of business grew and he wrote more articles featuring stories about people who had grown sick or died after seeing Brinkley. But JAMA&#x27;s readership was mostly restricted to doctors, while Brinkley&#x27;s radio station poured directly into peoples&#x27; homes every day.
After his birth on September 3, 1927, the tiny voice of Brinkley&#x27;s son John Richard Brinkley III, nicknamed &quot;Johnny Boy&quot;, was heard on the radio program. Aware of the baby&#x27;s arrival after 14 years of marriage, some observers wondered if Brinkley had taken his own goat gland treatment. The Brinkleys denied such rumors.

===Medical Question Box===
Brinkley began claiming his goat glands could also help male prostate problems, and expanded his business again. He also started a new radio segment called &quot;Medical Question Box&quot;, where he would read listeners&#x27; medical complaints over the air and suggest proprietary treatments. These treatments were only available at a network of pharmacies that were members of the &quot;Brinkley Pharmaceutical Association&quot;. These affiliated pharmacies sold Brinkley&#x27;s over-the-counter medicines at highly inflated prices, sent a portion of their profit back to Brinkley and kept the rest. It is estimated that this generated $14,000 in profit weekly for Brinkley ( per year). Reports of patients who took Brinkley&#x27;s suggested treatments showing up sick at another doctor&#x27;s office began to grow, and eventually Merck &amp; Co. pharmaceuticals, whose medicines Brinkley routinely misprescribed, requested Fishbein take action; the AMA responded that they had no power over Brinkley, save to try to inform the public.

&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, which owned a radio station that competed with Brinkley&#x27;s, ran an unfavorable series of reports on him. By 1930, when the Kansas Medical Board held a formal hearing to decide whether Brinkley&#x27;s medical license should be revoked, Brinkley had signed death certificates for 42 people, many of whom were not sick when they showed up at his clinic. It is unclear how many more of Brinkley&#x27;s patients may have become ill or later died elsewhere. The medical board revoked his license, stating that Brinkley &quot;has performed an organized charlatanism ... quite beyond the invention of the humble mountebank&quot;.

Six months after losing his medical license, the Federal Radio Commission refused to renew his station&#x27;s broadcasting license, finding that Brinkley&#x27;s broadcasts were mostly advertising, which violated international treaties, that he broadcast obscene material, and that his Medical Question Box series was &quot;contrary to the public interest&quot;. He sued the commission, but the courts upheld the revocation and the case &quot;KFKB Broadcasting Association v. Federal Radio Commission&quot; became a landmark case in broadcast law.

==Political career==

Brinkley reacted to losing his medical and broadcast licenses by launching a bid to become the Governor of Kansas, a political position that would enable him to appoint his own members to the medical board and thus regain his right to practice medicine in the state. He kicked off his candidacy just three days after he lost his medical license, using his radio station to help his campaign. At his side was KFKB&#x27;s biggest country-music star, Roy Faulkner, who took to the stage with guitar and hat in hand. A populist, Brinkley campaigned on a vague program of public works (a state lake in every county), education (free textbooks for public schoolchildren and increased educational opportunities for blacks), lower taxes, and old-age pensions. He appealed to the immigrant vote by putting German and Swedish-speaking people on the air at KFKB. Brinkley enlisted a pilot with his own plane (Brinkley dubbed it &quot;The Romancer&quot;) to deliver him in grand style at his campaign rallies. In short, Brinkley was a master of the publicity stunt; when a prominent newspaper reporter ran an article critical of his qualifications to run a state, Brinkley sent him a goat.
His campaign was conducted as an independent write-in candidate, because he waited to declare his candidacy until September, after the ballots had already been printed. Three days before the election, the Kansas attorney general (who had prosecuted Brinkley before the medical board) announced that the rules surrounding write-in candidates had changed, and that the doctor&#x27;s name could only be written in one specific way for the vote to count (as J. R. Brinkley). As a write-in candidate, he received more than 180,000 votes (29.5 percent of the vote) and lost to Harry Hines Woodring, later Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An article published at the time in &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 ballots were disqualified in this manner. Woodring later admitted that had those votes counted, Brinkley would have won.

Brinkley ran again in 1932 as an Independent, receiving 244,607 votes (30.6 percent of the vote), losing to Republican Alf Landon, later Republican nominee for president in 1936.

His prospects for success in Kansas destroyed, Brinkley sold KFKB to an insurance company and decided to move closer to the Mexican border, where he could operate a high-power radio station with impunity. Though he could no longer practice medicine in Kansas, he kept his Milford clinic open and put two of his protégés in charge. Wooed by the prospect of being a big fish in a very small pond, Brinkley relocated to Del Rio, Texas, which lay just across a bridge from Mexico.

Brinkley became a Nazi sympathizer later in the 1930s. He donated $629 to the Silver Legion of America in 1939.

==Brinkley and radio==
The Mexican government, eager to get even with its northern neighbors for dividing up North America&#x27;s radio frequencies without giving any to Mexico, granted Brinkley a 50,000-watt radio license and construction began on XER, his new &quot;border blaster&quot; across the bridge from Del Rio in Villa Acuña, Coahuila (since renamed Ciudad Acuña). Brinkley achieved this with the help of Esther O. Crosby, owner of Mrs Crosby&#x27;s Cafe in Acuña. As construction got underway, Fishbein and the U.S. State Department desperately searched for a way to shut Brinkley down. Under heavy pressure from the State Department, the Mexican government halted construction on XER, but it was only temporary. Within weeks, construction resumed and soon two towers reached into the sky. XER, at 840 kilohertz on the AM dial, radiated by a sky wave antenna, made its first broadcast in October 1931. Brinkley called it the &quot;Sunshine Station Between the Nations&quot;.

Brinkley used his new border blaster to resume his campaign for governor by using the telephone to call in his broadcasts to the transmitter. This approach did not work, and he lost yet another political campaign; he would lose again in 1934. Though Brinkley&#x27;s American radio license had been revoked, XER&#x27;s signal was so strong that it could still be heard in Kansas. In 1932, the Mexican government allowed Brinkley to increase his wattage to 150,000 watts. Several months later, Brinkley was allowed to increase to one million watts, &quot;making XER far and away the most powerful radio station on the planet&quot; that, on a clear night, could be heard as far away as Canada. According to accounts of the time, the signal was so strong that it turned on car headlights, made bedsprings hum, and caused broadcasts to bleed into telephone conversations. Local residents claimed to not need a radio to hear Brinkley&#x27;s station; with ranchers claiming that they received it through their metal fences and in their dental appliances.

Brinkley continued his old radio format of medical advice keyed to advertising products. Male listeners were offered an array of expensive concoctions which included Mercurochrome injections and pills, all designed to help them regain their sexual prowess. At the clinic in the hotel where he lived, he also performed prostate operations. He also began selling airtime to other advertisers (at $1,700 an hour, ), giving rise to new hucksters shilling products such as &quot;Crazy Water Crystals&quot;, &quot;genuine simulated&quot; diamonds, life insurance, and an array of religious paraphernalia, including what was purported to be autographed pictures of Jesus Christ. Brinkley also continued packing his radio lineup with up-and-coming country and roots singers whose careers his radio station helped launch (including Patsy Montana, Red Foley, Gene Autry, Jimmie Rodgers, the Carter Family, the Pickard Family, and others). Del Rio became known as &quot;Hillbilly Hollywood&quot;.

When the FRC banned what they called &quot;spooks&quot; (mind readers, fortune-tellers and other mystics) from broadcasting on U.S. radio in 1932, many of them followed Brinkley&#x27;s model, opening their own border blasters in Mexico. By 1932, 11 such stations had opened, including XENT, XERB, XELO, XEG and XEPN.

Brinkley was still shuttling back and forth from Milford to Del Rio, often broadcasting from XER over the telephone. In 1932, Congress passed a law prohibiting studios in the United States from being connected to transmitters in Mexico by telephone, known as the Brinkley Act. Unfazed, Brinkley began using some of the first &quot;electrical transcriptions&quot;—what today would be called pre-recordings—to circumvent the law. Around this time, Brinkley decided to sever the rest of his ties to Kansas, closing down his hospital there and opening a new one in Del Rio, which took up three floors of the Roswell Hotel, where he lived with his wife.

In 1934, Mexico revoked Brinkley&#x27;s broadcast license, the result of pressure from the United States. Soldiers from the Mexican army arrived at the station&#x27;s doorstep to shut him down, and for a time he had to broadcast from nearby XEPN, located in Piedras Negras, Coahuila.

Though Brinkley continued to perform the occasional goat gland transplant, in Texas his practice shifted mostly to performing slightly modified vasectomies and prostate &quot;rejuvenations&quot; for which he charged up to $1,000 per operation (), and prescribed his own proprietary medicine for after-care. His business, fueled by radio advertisements and speeches, continued to thrive, and he opened another clinic in San Juan, Texas, specializing in the colon. By 1936, Brinkley had amassed enough wealth to build a mansion for himself and his wife on of land. Brinkley boasted a stable of a dozen Cadillacs, a greenhouse, a foaming fountain garden surrounded by 8,000 bushes, exotic animals imported from the Galapagos Islands, and a swimming pool with a diving tower. Brinkley continued living high in Del Rio, until in 1938 a rival doctor began cutting into Brinkley&#x27;s business by offering similar procedures much more cheaply. When Del Rio&#x27;s city elders refused to put the competitor out of business, Brinkley closed up shop and reopened in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas, with another hospital at what is now Marylake Monastery. His competition from Del Rio opened a new cancer center in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, about northwest of Little Rock.

==Trial and death==

In 1938, Brinkley&#x27;s old nemesis, Morris Fishbein, entered the picture again with a vengeance, publishing a two-part series called &quot;Modern Medical Charlatans&quot; that included a thorough repudiation of Brinkley&#x27;s checkered career, as well as exposing his questionable medical credentials. Brinkley sued Fishbein for libel and $250,000 in damages (). The trial began on March 22, 1939 before Texas judge R. J. MacMillan. A few days later, the jury found for Fishbein, stating that Brinkley &quot;should be considered a charlatan and a quack in the ordinary, well-understood meaning of those words&quot;. The jury verdict unleashed a barrage of lawsuits against Brinkley, by some estimates well over $3 million in total value. Also around this time, the Internal Revenue Service began investigating him for tax fraud. He declared bankruptcy in 1941, the same year implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement provided an avenue for the United States to get Mexico to shut down XERA.

Soon after his bankruptcy, the U.S. Post Office Department began investigating him for mail fraud, and Brinkley became a patient himself, having suffered three heart attacks and the amputation of one of his legs due to poor circulation. On May 26, 1942, Brinkley died penniless of heart failure in San Antonio; the mail fraud case had not yet come to trial. He was later buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

In early 2017, the bronze winged angel atop his grave column was cut off and stolen, in an ongoing spate of similar robberies from Memphis cemeteries.

His house, commonly called the Brinkley Mansion, still stands today at 512 Qualia Drive in Del Rio and has been designated Texas Historic Landmark number 13015.

<text>Anthocharis julia, also known as the Southern Rocky Mountain Orangetip, is a type of butterfly found in the southern Rocky Mountains on the eastern side of the range. Their caterpillars feed on rock cress (&quot;Arabis&quot;) species. Adults feed on flower nectar from host plants as well as thistles, fiddleneck, and brodiaeas. Its habitats include foothill canyons and washes, usually in oak woodland, as well as forested riparian areas.

<text>Phyllis Linda Hyman (July 6, 1949 – June 30, 1995) was an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Hyman&#x27;s music career spanned the late 1970s through the early 1990s, and she was best known for her expansive contralto range. Some of her most notable songs are &quot;You Know How to Love Me&quot; (1979), &quot;Living All Alone&quot; (1986) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Change the World&quot; (1991). Hyman is also known for her covers of popular songs, which include renditions of &quot;Betcha by Golly Wow&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot;, and &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do For Love&quot;. 

Hyman also performed on Broadway in the 1981 musical revue &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;, which ran from 1981 until 1983. The revue, based on the music of Duke Ellington, earned her a Theatre World Award and a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical.

After an extended struggle with her mental health, Hyman died by suicide in 1995 at her New York City apartment.

==Early life and early career==
The eldest of seven children, Hyman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Phillip, a World War II veteran, and Louise Hyman, a waitress at a local night club, and grew up in St. Clair Village, the South Hills section of Pittsburgh. Hyman&#x27;s paternal great-grandparents were Ishmael and Cassandra (Cross) Hyman. After leaving Pittsburgh, her music training started at a music school. On graduation, she performed on a national tour with the group, New Direction, in 1971. After the group disbanded, she joined All the People and worked with another local group, The Hondo Beat. She appeared in the film &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974). She also did a two-year stint leading a band called &quot;Phyllis Hyman and the P/H Factor.&quot; In 1975, music industry veteran, Sid Maurer, and former Epic Records promoter, Fred Frank, discovered and signed her to their Roadshow Records/Desert Moon imprint.

Hyman moved to New York City where she did background vocals on Jon Lucien&#x27;s &quot;Premonition&quot; and worked in clubs. In 1975 when Norman Connors was laying tracks for &quot;You Are My Starship&quot; (1976), he could not get permission to use Jean Carne for the album. He heard about Phyllis Hyman, who was working at a club on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. One night after a Jon Lucien concert at Carnegie Hall, he saw Hyman perform and offered her a spot as the female vocalist on his fourth album for Buddah Records. After the title song got airplay on jazz radio, &quot;You Are My Starship&quot; went gold, catapulting Hyman&#x27;s, Norman Connors&#x27;s, and Michael Henderson&#x27;s careers to new heights. R&amp;B radio jumped on board and Connors and Hyman scored on the R&amp;B chart with a remake of The Stylistics&#x27; &quot;Betcha by Golly Wow!&quot;

==Later career==
Hyman sang with Pharoah Sanders and the Fatback Band while working on her first solo album, &quot;Phyllis Hyman&quot;, released in 1977 on the Buddah Records label. When Arista Records bought Buddha, she was transferred to that label. Her first album for Arista, &quot;Somewhere in My Lifetime&quot;, was released in 1978; the title track was produced by then-labelmate Barry Manilow. Her follow-up album, &quot;You Know How to Love Me&quot;, made the R&amp;B Top 20 and also performed well on the club–dance charts. Around that time she lent her background vocals to the debut album by The Beck Family, &quot;Dancin&#x27; on the Ceiling&quot;. The group had a hit with &quot;Can&#x27;t Shake the Feeling&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Hyman married her manager Larry Alexander (the brother of Jamaican pianist and melodica player Monty Alexander), but both the personal and professional associations ended in divorce. Around this time, Hyman began using cocaine, for which she developed a lifelong dependency. Hyman&#x27;s first solo R&amp;B Top Ten hit came in 1981 with &quot;Can&#x27;t We Fall in Love Again?&quot;, a duet with Michael Henderson. The song was recorded while she was performing in the Broadway musical &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington. She performed in the role for almost two years, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical and winning a Theatre World Award for Best Newcomer. Problems between Hyman and her label, Arista, caused a pause in her recording career. She used the time to appear on movie soundtracks, television commercials and guest vocals, working with Chuck Mangione, The Whispers and The Four Tops. Hyman provided vocals for three tracks on jazz pianist McCoy Tyner&#x27;s &quot;Looking Out&quot; (1982). She toured often and did a college lecture tour.

In 1983, Hyman recorded the song &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; as the title song for the James Bond movie of the same name, written by Stephen Forsyth and Jim Ryan. However, Warner Brothers informed Forsyth that Michel Legrand, who wrote the score for the film, had threatened to sue them, claiming he contractually had the rights to the title song. An alternate title song composed by Legrand was eventually used for the film and performed by singer Lani Hall, formerly of Sérgio Mendes and Brasil &#x27;66. Free from Arista in 1985, Hyman released the album &quot;Living All Alone&quot; on Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff&#x27;s Philadelphia International label in 1986, capitalizing on the torch songs, &quot;Old Friend&quot; and the melancholy title track, as well as &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. In 1987, Phyllis Hyman recorded &quot;Black and Blue&quot; as a duet with Barry Manilow on his 1987 &quot;Swing Street&quot; Arista album. Manilow was a long time admirer of Hyman and her work. Shortly afterward, she appeared in the films &quot;School Daze&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Kill Reflex&quot; (1989). She would also continue to lend her voice to albums for other artists and musicians, including Grover Washington, Jr. and Lonnie Liston Smith, while at the same time doing international tours.

Hyman&#x27;s next album, &quot;Prime of My Life&quot;, released in 1991, again on Philadelphia International, was the biggest of her career. It included her first number-one R&amp;B hit as well as her first &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Change the World&quot;. The album provided two more top 10 R&amp;B singles in &quot;Living in Confusion&quot; and &quot;When You Get Right Down to It&quot;, and the less successful &quot;I Found Love&quot;. Just over a year later, she appeared one last time on a Norman Connors album, singing the title song, &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot;, which became a minor R&amp;B hit. The album and debut single were both RIAA certified Gold in 1992.

==Death==
Hyman suffered from bipolar disorder and depression for years, having been diagnosed in the 1980s. She often self-medicated with alcohol and drugs, and frequently spoke about suicide. On the afternoon of June 30, 1995, six days before her 46th birthday, Hyman died by suicide by overdosing on a mixture of tuinal and vodka in the bedroom of her New York City apartment at 211 West 56th Street. She was found unconscious at 2:00 p.m. (EDT) and died at 3:50 p.m. at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West), hours before she was scheduled to perform at the Apollo Theater. Her suicide note read in part:

I&#x27;m tired. I&#x27;m tired. Those of you that I love know who you are. May God bless you. 

Hyman was cremated after an autopsy was performed. A memorial service was held at St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Manhattan.

==Personal life==
Hyman was married once, to Larry Alexander, who served as her music arranger from 1977 until divorcing in 1982. She had no children. 

Hyman was also the cousin of actor Earle Hyman, best known for his recurring role on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as Cliff&#x27;s father, Russell Huxtable, and as Panthro on the popular 80s cartoon Thundercats.

==Posthumous releases==
In November 1995, five months after her death, Hyman&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;I Refuse to Be Lonely&quot; was released. It is regarded by fans and critics alike as a lyrical journey into her personal life and state of mind prior to her passing. Both the title track and the single &quot;I&#x27;m Truly Yours&quot; became minor R&amp;B hits. 

In April 1998, a posthumous compilation album, &quot;One on One&quot; was released with three of her earliest solo sides and nine collaborations including &quot;Take the &#x27;A&#x27; Train&quot; with Gregory Hines, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; with the Four Tops, and &quot;Betcha By Golly Wow&quot; with Norman Connors.

Three years after her death, a second posthumous album of previously unreleased material was released. Songs were culled from various recording sessions from the mid-1980s into the early 1990s. &quot;Forever with You&quot; (1998) contains love songs, torch songs, bitter-sweet ballads, smooth jazz offerings and uptempo tracks, most of which showcase Hyman&#x27;s&#x27; usual interpretation of heartbreak and strife. Hyman was quoted as saying that these songs were about &quot;relationships gone bad!&quot; Much of the material on this album was initially intended for her &quot;Living All Alone&quot; release. The song &quot;Funny How Love Goes&quot; contains a posthumous &quot;duet&quot; featuring vocalist Damon Williams. Half of Hyman&#x27;s vocals were re-recorded with both singers alternating vocals and providing Williams with exposure. The UK label Expansion released a jazz-soul orientated compilation in 2003 called &quot;In Between the Heartaches&quot; that featured cuts from her collaborations with Norman Connors, McCoy Tyner, Jon Lucien and Pharoah Sanders. It also included five unreleased tracks from her period with Arista records.

In September 2007, an authorized biography was released. Entitled &quot;Strength of a Woman: The Phyllis Hyman Story&quot;, the book is written by Jason A. Michael in cooperation with the Estate of Phyllis Hyman. The book mentions Hyman&#x27;s relationships with men and one woman. In 2008, an original version of the James Bond theme &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, which was not used in the film due to contractual issues, was released by the track&#x27;s co-writer Stephen Forsythe. Forsythe has been quoted as stating:

<text>New Faces of 1952, also known as Leonard Sillman&#x27;s New Faces of 1952, is a 1952 musical revue with songs and comedy skits, produced and conceived by Leonard Sillman. It was the fourth of Sillman&#x27;s seven &quot;New Faces&quot; revues, each intended to showcase the rising stars of that time; the other years for which &quot;New Faces of ...&quot; revues were produced were 1934, 1936, 1943, 1956, 1962, and 1968. &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; was the most successful of the series, and is generally considered the best, for both the talent of the performers and the quality of the writing. The show ran on Broadway for nearly a year in 1952, and helped launch the careers of Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Carol Lawrence, Ronny Graham, performer/writer Mel Brooks (as Melvin Brooks), and lyricist Sheldon Harnick.

Songs from the show include &quot;Monotonous&quot;, sung by Eartha Kitt in the show and identified with her throughout her career; &quot;Guess Who I Saw Today&quot;, sung by June Carroll in the show and subsequently recorded by numerous singers, most notably Nancy Wilson; and &quot;Love is a Simple Thing&quot;, sung in the show by Rosemary O&#x27;Reilly, Robert Clary, Eartha Kitt, and June Carroll and later recorded by artists including Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, Debbie Reynolds, Arthur Siegel, Jane Morgan, Carmen McRae and the Muppets.

&quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; was adapted as a 1954 film, titled simply &quot;New Faces&quot;, which included the original cast. In 1982 the revue had an off-Broadway revival at the Equity Library Theatre.

==Broadway production==
The revue opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on May 16, 1952, and ran for 365 performances. It was produced by Leonard Sillman, directed by John Murray Anderson and John Beal with choreography by Richard Barstow. The sketches were written by Graham and Brooks. The songs were composed by, among others, Harnick, Graham, Murray Grand and Arthur Siegel. The cast featured Graham, Kitt, Clary, Virginia Bosler, June Carroll, Virginia De Luce, Ghostley, Patricia Hammerlee, Lawrence, Lynde and Bill Milliken. De Luce and Graham won the 1952 Theatre World Award. The revue marked Kitt&#x27;s Broadway debut, singing a &quot;sultry rendition&quot; of &quot;Monotonous&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek lament of how boring her ridiculously successful life was.

===Songs===
;Act I
* Opening (Ronny Graham, Peter DeVries) and Company
* Lucky Pierre (Ronny Graham) - Pierre (Robert Clary), Reporter and Chorus
* Guess Who I Saw Today (Elisse Boyd, Murray Grand) - June Carroll
* Restoration Piece - Lady Sylvia Malpractice, Simple, Sir Solemnity Sourpuss and Sir Militant Malpractice
* Love Is a Simple Thing (lyrics by June Carroll, music by Arthur Siegel) - Rosemary O&#x27;Reilly, Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, June Carroll
* Boston Beguine (Sheldon Harnick) - Alice Ghostley
* Nanty Puts Her Hair Up (Herbert Farjeon, Siegel) - Nanty, Father, Mother, Brother and Highlander
* Time for Tea (Carroll-Siegel) - Marcella, Lavinia, Lavinia, the Girl, Marcella, the Girl, Mother, Father, John and Guest
* Bal Petit Bal (Francis Lemarque) - Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary

* Monotonous (Carroll, Siegel) - (Sung by Eartha Kitt)
* The Great American Opera - Toby, Madame Flora and Effie 
* He Takes Me Off His Income Tax (Siegel, Carroll) - Virginia de Luce. Song begun, then interrupted four times throughout the show, before 1) Boston Beguine, 2) Nanty Puts Her Hair Up, 3) Three for the Road medley, and 4) I&#x27;m in Love with Miss Logan. 
===Sketches===
The show featured three non-musical sketches. &quot;Of Fathers and Sons&quot;, written by Mel Brooks, was a parody of the Arthur Miller drama Death of a Salesman with characters Mae, Harry, Stanley and Policeman; a pickpocket is angry with his son for not wanting to join the family business. In &quot;Oedipus Goes South&quot;, Ronny Graham parodies Truman Capote. Paul Lynde, wrapped in bandages, bemoans his African safari. In &quot;The Bard and the Beard&quot; the characters - Miss Leigh, Sir Laurence, Call Boy and Maid - try to remember what play they are supposed to be in.

Brooks&#x27; sketch had originally been written for another revue, &quot;Curtain Going Up&quot;, which did not make it to Broadway due to an unsuccessful tryout in Philadelphia. Sillman and Graham had seen the show during its tryout and asked Brooks for permission to include the sketch in &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; instead, which Brooks happily granted.

== Film adaptation ==

Retitled &quot;New Faces&quot;, the film version was directed by Harry Horner in Cinemascope and Eastmancolor, and released by Twentieth Century Fox on March 6, 1954. Ronny Graham, Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Alice Ghostley, June Carroll, Virginia De Luce, Carol Lawrence, Patricia Hammerlee, Paul Lynde, and Bill Millikin repeated their stage roles. The film was basically a reproduction of the stage revue with a thin plot added. The plot involved a producer and performer (Ronny Graham) in financial trouble on opening night. A wealthy Texan offers to help out, on the condition that his daughter be in the show.

The song order was changed, and some songs were added and removed. Songs added include:
*&quot;Crazy, Man!&quot; (Lynde, Graham)
*&quot;Uska Dara&quot; (Kitt)
*&quot;C&#x27;est si bon&quot; (Kitt)
*&quot;Santa Baby&quot; (Kitt)

The songs omitted were:
* &quot;Nanty Puts her Hair Up&quot; (though an abridged version was used as an instrumental in a dance routine)
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Asleep&quot;

The song &quot;Love is a Simple Thing&quot; omitted the final verse, which references Charles Addams. An extra verse was added to &quot;Lizzie Borden&quot;. Some of the lines in &quot;Monotonous&quot; were replaced and updated: &quot;Harry S. Truman plays bop for me&quot; was changed to &quot;Toscanini plays bop for me&quot;, and &quot;Ike likes me&quot; was changed to the opening notes of the &quot;Dragnet&quot; theme, followed by the words &quot;They wrote it for me&quot;.

==Cast recording==
Leonard Sillman&#x27;s New Faces Of 1952 (Original Cast) was the official release of the cast recording of the Broadway revue &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot;. The album was originally released on a 12&quot; LP by RCA Victor, LOC-1008. Some material was excluded, as not all songs could fit on the record. In 1977, the album was reissued on the RCA Red Seal label, catalog number CBM1-2206.

The cast recording, like the play, was produced by Leonard Sillman. The orchestral conductor for the album and play was Anton Coppola. Orchestral arrangements were by Ted Royal. Alice Ghostley, Allen Conroy, Bill Mullikin, Carol Lawrence, Carol Nelson, Eartha Kitt, Jimmy Russell, Joseph Lautner, June Carroll, Michael Dominico, Patricia Hammerlee, Paul Lynde, Robert Clary, Ronny Graham, Rosemary O&#x27;Reilly, Virginia Bosler, and Virginia de Luce all perform on the album.

In 2003, Jasmine Records reissued the cast album on compact disc for the first time, featuring the original RCA LP track listing. In 2009, Sony Music, which now owns the RCA Victor archive, released the album on CD (catalog number &quot;Arkiv RCA-04441&quot;) and digital download. This second CD reissue included the previously unreleased song &quot;Time For Tea&quot; performed by June Carroll and Alice Ghostley.

;12&quot; Long Play
&quot;Track listings and credits adapted from the original label notes of album, unless other wise specified.&quot;

;2009 re-issues

==1982 revival==
The Equity Library Theatre in New York City presented an Off-Broadway revival in 1982, directed by Joseph Patton and featuring comedic performances by Lillian Graff, Philip Wm. Mckinley, Alan Safier, and Randy Brenner in the roles originated by Ghostley, Lynde, Graham, and Clary, respectively. Kitt joined the cast late in the run to re-create her original role.

<doc id="978611" wikidata="Q6269544" url="?curid=978611" title="Joint quantum entropy">
<text>The joint quantum entropy generalizes the classical joint entropy to the context of quantum information theory. Intuitively, given two quantum states formula_1 and formula_2, represented as density operators that are subparts of a quantum system, the joint quantum entropy is a measure of the total uncertainty or entropy of the joint system. It is written formula_3 or formula_4, depending on the notation being used for the von Neumann entropy. Like other entropies, the joint quantum entropy is measured in bits, i.e. the logarithm is taken in base 2.

In this article, we will use formula_3 for the joint quantum entropy.

==Background==

In information theory, for any classical random variable formula_6, the classical Shannon entropy formula_7 is a measure of how uncertain we are about the outcome of formula_6. For example, if formula_6 is a probability distribution concentrated at one point, the outcome of formula_6 is certain and therefore its entropy formula_11. At the other extreme, if formula_6 is the uniform probability distribution with formula_13 possible values, intuitively one would expect formula_6 is associated with the most uncertainty. Indeed, such uniform probability distributions have maximum possible entropy formula_15.

In quantum information theory, the notion of entropy is extended from probability distributions to quantum states, or density matrices. For a state formula_1, the von Neumann entropy is defined by

:formula_17

Applying the spectral theorem, or Borel functional calculus for infinite dimensional systems, we see that it generalizes the classical entropy. The physical meaning remains the same. A maximally mixed state, the quantum analog of the uniform probability distribution, has maximum von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, a pure state, or a rank one projection, will have zero von Neumann entropy. We write the von Neumann entropy formula_18 (or sometimes formula_19.

== Definition ==

Given a quantum system with two subsystems &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the term joint quantum entropy simply refers to the von Neumann entropy of the combined system. This is to distinguish from the entropy of the subsystems.
In symbols, if the combined system is in state formula_20,

the joint quantum entropy is then

:formula_21

Each subsystem has its own entropy. The state of the subsystems are given by the partial trace operation.

==Properties==

The classical joint entropy is always at least equal to the entropy of each individual system. This is not the case for the joint quantum entropy. If the quantum state formula_20 exhibits quantum entanglement, then the entropy of each subsystem may be larger than the joint entropy. This is equivalent to the fact that the conditional quantum entropy may be negative, while the classical conditional entropy may never be.

Consider a maximally entangled state such as a Bell state. If formula_20 is a Bell state, say,

:formula_24

then the total system is a pure state, with entropy 0, while each individual subsystem is a maximally mixed state, with maximum von Neumann entropy formula_25. Thus the joint entropy of the combined system is less than that of subsystems. This is because for entangled states, definite states cannot be assigned to subsystems, resulting in positive entropy.

Notice that the above phenomenon cannot occur if a state is a separable pure state. In that case, the reduced states of the subsystems are also pure. Therefore, all entropies are zero.

==Relations to other entropy measures==

The joint quantum entropy formula_26 can be used to define of the conditional quantum entropy:

:formula_27

and the quantum mutual information:

:formula_28

These definitions parallel the use of the classical joint entropy to define the conditional entropy and mutual information.

<text>Newsmax, Inc. (or Newsmax.com, previously styled NewsMax) is an American cable news, political opinion commentary, and digital media company founded by Christopher Ruddy in 1998. It has been variously described as conservative, right-wing, and far-right. Newsmax Media divisions include its cable and broadcast channel Newsmax TV; its website Newsmax.com, which includes Newsmax Health and Newsmax Finance; and Newsmax magazine, its monthly print publication.

Newsmax launched a cable television channel on June 16, 2014, to 35 million satellite subscribers through DirecTV and Dish Network. As of May 2019, the network claimed to reach about 70 million households via cable television. As of September 2023, the average audience for Newsmax was 542,000.

The channel primarily broadcasts from Newsmax&#x27;s New York studio on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, with two headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, and Washington, D.C. Newsmax began broadcasting in the UK in October 2023, via Freeview Connect.

The website has been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;potent force in conservative politics.&quot; CEO Christopher Ruddy has attempted to position the network as a competitor to Fox News, including by hiring former Fox News hosts Rob Schmitt, Greg Kelly, Bob Sellers, and Heather Childers. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Newsmax as &quot;a landing spot for cable news personalities in need of a new home,&quot; citing the network&#x27;s airing of Mark Halperin and Bill O&#x27;Reilly following their resignations from other networks due to sexual harassment allegations.

After the 2020 United States presidential election, Newsmax published numerous conspiracy theories made by President Donald Trump and the Trump campaign about voter fraud in the 2020 election, though the network never confirmed the veracity of the statements and accepted Joe Biden as duly elected president. Newsmax later issued an apology and publicly retracted any voter fraud conspiracy allegations. When asked about Newsmax&#x27;s support of former President Trump, Ruddy stated, &quot;We have an editorial policy of being supportive of the president and his policies&quot;.

In 2021, Newsmax was sued by Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic for promoting false claims that the companies had engaged in election fraud during the 2020 presidential election. Newsmax and Smartmatic settled the suit on confidential terms on September 26, 2024. DirecTV dropped Newsmax from its lineup in January 2023, after the companies failed to agree on contract terms. In response, forty-two House Republicans signed a letter to DirecTV executives attacking the removal as an act of &quot;suppressing politically disfavored speech.&quot; The two companies were able to resolve the dispute and DirecTV resumed broadcasting Newsmax on March 23, 2023.

== History and content ==
Ruddy started Newsmax.com on September 16, 1998, supported by a group of investors, including the family of former Central Intelligence Agency Director William J. Casey. Later, Richard Mellon Scaife, Ruddy&#x27;s former employer at the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, invested in the fledgling company. One of the initial board members was author James Dale Davidson who edited a financial newsletter. Davidson&#x27;s co-editor, Lord Rees-Mogg, former editor of the &quot;Times&quot; of London, later became chairman of Newsmax. Ruddy previously promoted conspiracy theories around the suicide of Vince Foster.

Other news figures who later joined the Newsmax board included Arnaud de Borchgrave, the longtime &quot;Newsweek&quot; chief correspondent who also serves as editor-at-large of United Press International (UPI), and Jeff Cunningham, former publisher of &quot;Forbes&quot;. Admiral Thomas Moorer, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and chief of naval operations during the Vietnam War, also served as one of the company&#x27;s founding board members. Former United States secretary of state and Nixon and Ford administration chief of staff General Alexander M. Haig, Jr. served as special adviser to Newsmax.

From its founding in 1998, Newsmax became known for its anti-Clinton content. However in the fall of 2007, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy published a favorable review of former president Bill Clinton&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; and a positive interview with him at Newsmax.com, followed by a positive cover story in &quot;Newsmax&quot; magazine. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said with reference to the event that politics had made &quot;.&quot; Bill Clinton also visited the Newsmax headquarters in West Palm Beach in 2010. In 2014, Newsmax donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation and Ruddy has accompanied Clinton on foundation trips to Africa. 

In a January 2010 profile on the company, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the &quot;rise of Newsmax&quot; had defied the media trend and said that the Newsmax website was &quot;one of the strongest conservative voices online&quot;. The paper said Newsmax had witnessed 40 percent growth rates per annum over the past decade, closing 2009 with $36 million revenues, up from $25 million the year before. A 2010 &quot;New York Post&quot; story reported that the paper&#x27;s long-time former editor Kenneth Chandler would become &quot;Newsmax Magazine&#x27;s&quot; editor-in-chief. Earlier Ruddy had told &quot;Business Insider&quot; the company expected annual 2010 revenues to reach $50 million.

A profile on Newsmax in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the company as a &quot;potent force in conservative politics&quot; and noted the company&#x27;s headquarters had become a must stop for Republican candidates seeking the party&#x27;s 2012 nomination.

Starting in April 2013, Newsmax.com and its affiliated sites drew 14.4 million unique visitors, leading comScore&#x27;s News/Politics category over such sites as &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; Politics, Fox News Politics, CNN Politics, NBCNews.com Politics, and Politico in monthly viewership for two consecutive months.

In March 2014, Newsmax was profiled in Bloomberg Businessweek by correspondent Karl Taro Greenfeld. The story detailed Newsmax&#x27;s successful business model of targeting higher-incomed baby boomers. The average age of a Newsmax online reader is 54.7 years of age. The profile detailed Newsmax&#x27;s plans to launch a linear and Over-the-top (OTT) content cable channel, and suggested their revenue model which sells &quot;a smorgasbord of political, health, and financial information, self-help books, and even vitamin supplements&quot; could make the company uniquely competitive in this arena.

Newsmax contributors include Nancy Brinker, George Will, Lanny Davis, Alan Dershowitz, Christopher W. Ruddy, David Limbaugh, Ben Stein, Susan Estrich, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, Michael Reagan, Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Michael Roizen.

In November 2017, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Fox News, facing new competitors, was giving more favorable coverage to President Donald Trump. In an interview, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy criticized Fox News&#x27; hosts unwillingness to criticize President Donald Trump, telling Politico that &quot;Newsmax is very supportive of the president, but we also will publish things that are critical of him time to time,&quot; Ruddy said. &quot;Fox seems to have decided to become very closely aligned, which seems unnatural, and it doesn&#x27;t seem consistent.

=== Coverage of the 2020 United States presidential election ===

During the 2020 United States presidential election, President Trump began to promote Newsmax over its rival, Fox News. Trump&#x27;s preference for Newsmax over Fox News became clearer after the latter became the first news outlet to call Arizona for Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Newsmax has made their more conservative leanings a selling point to disaffected Fox News viewers, as well as employing Fox News alumni to join their lineup on Newsmax TV, such as Rob Schmitt and Greg Kelly. Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;Vox&quot; reported that the outlet &quot;spent lots of time arguing that other media outlets jumped the gun in calling the election for Biden and that Trump still has a path to win this thing,&quot; and that it was one of the only networks that didn&#x27;t call the election for Biden, citing the Trump campaign&#x27;s legal challenges. However, she did write that &quot;Newsmax doesn&#x27;t go full arch-conservative&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t give airtime to QAnon paranoiacs.&quot;

CNN&#x27;s Brian Stelter, in an on-air interview, asked Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy why the network chose to air &quot;election denialism&quot; and &quot;bogus voter fraud stuff,&quot; to which Ruddy replied that the network featured all points of view and argued that all of the other major news outlets who had reported Biden&#x27;s election win were &quot;rushing&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Ruddy stated that, &quot;We are waiting for the states&#x27; certification and the electoral college, but we will at some point when that happens&quot; and insisted: &quot;We will be supportive of whoever the next president is.&quot; He added &quot;Newsmax would never become Trump TV. We have always seen ourselves as an independent news agency&quot; but would be willing to Trump having a weekly show. Ruddy says the company is &quot;moderately conservative and we will continue to have a moderately conservative viewpoint on things – including the president.&quot;

In a later interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Ruddy stated, &quot;I do think that Donald Trump should concede when the certifications come in,&quot; he said, adding that he &quot;would not support going to state legislators to overturn the electors.&quot;

Following the certification of the electoral college of Joe Biden as the winner on December 14, 2020, the network began using the title, &quot;President-elect&quot; to refer to Biden.

=== Acquisition reports ===
On November 15, 2020, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Hicks Equity Partners, a private equity firm with ties to a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, was exploring a buyout of Newsmax. The Hicks group identified a team of executives who would manage the network, and had been talking to former Fox News hosts including Megyn Kelly. Media analyst Michael Nathanson reported that if a competing network took 20% of Fox News&#x27; audience, it could sap about $200 million in annual profit from the company. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy stated &quot;we are not actively selling&quot; the company though he had expressions of interests from investors. Regarding Hicks Equity Partners, Ruddy stated, &quot;we have no deal with them.&quot; Ruddy stated that &quot;We would like to overtake Fox News in 12 months, and I think it&#x27;s doable.&quot;

=== Post-2020 United States presidential election ===
Newsmax promoted baseless allegations that voting machine company Smartmatic and its competitor Dominion Voting Systems had conspired to rig the election against Trump. In December 2020, Smartmatic sent a letter to Newsmax threatening legal action and demanding &quot;a full and complete retraction of all false and defamatory statements and reports.&quot;

Days later, a Newsmax host stated the company &quot;would like to clarify its news coverage and note it has not reported as true certain claims&quot; made by Newsmax interviewees about Dominion and Smartmatic. Newsmax declared that it had &quot;no evidence&quot; of certain claims made on its programming, including the claim that the two companies have a business relationship, the claim that either company used each other&#x27;s software, and the claim that either company &quot;manipulated votes&quot; in the 2020 American general election. Newsmax also stated it had &quot;no evidence&quot; that Smartmatic software was used anywhere except Los Angeles during the 2020 election. Newsmax additionally said viewers should be aware of &quot;several facts&quot;, including that both companies have no relationship with George Soros, and that &quot;Smartmatic is a U.S. company and not owned by the Venezuelan government&quot; or any other foreign entity.

Mediaite&#x27;s Rudy Takala wrote that conservatives disgruntled with Fox News could potentially be disappointed by Newsmax due to CEO Christopher Ruddy&#x27;s friendship with former Democratic president Bill Clinton and positive remarks about a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Newsmax has previously donated $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. When reached for comment, Ruddy said, &quot;Like Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch and other business people, I have donated to the Clinton Foundation and a few Democrats, but over 90 percent of my political contributions have been to Republicans, including ones to President Trump.&quot;

Jeffrey McCall, a journalism professor at DePauw University, told Mediaite that &quot;Ruddy is a pragmatist unlikely to allow his operation to be a fully ideological platform. Trump allies who want to bend the arc of media progressivism will need a much more comprehensive national strategy than just trying to take over one particular media outlet.&quot;

&quot;Adweek&quot; reported that Newsmax&#x27;s TV ratings grew tenfold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the previous quarter. Its top two shows, Spicer &amp; Co. and Greg Kelly Reports (at 7 p.m.), averaged 816,000 total viewers during the same November 7–18 interval. Regarding coverage of the Biden administration, CEO Christopher Ruddy told &quot;Adweek&quot; &quot;I think Newsmax&#x27;s job is to be loyal opposition, to question the policies, the programs and the people that are coming into the Biden administration. We&#x27;re going to take a very careful look at that. I think we were pretty fair with Barack Obama. We were tough on him, but we never called for his impeachment&quot;, he said. Newsmax TV momentarily exceeded Fox News in viewership in December 2020, but lost viewers after the conclusion of the election cycle. A Pew Research Center study found that Newsmax&#x27;s reach (10% of American adults) continued to trail Fox News&#x27;s reach (43% of American adults) in March 2021.

In July 2021, &quot;Vox&quot; noted that &quot;Newsmax&#x27;s effort to out-Trump the competition has been less successful since Trump left the White House for Mar-a-Lago. Newsmax&#x27;s viewership is down more than 50 percent from January (from an average of about 300,000 viewers then to about 114,000 on July 18), and following a significant slump in December and January, Fox News has reestablished itself as not just the most-watched right-wing cable news network but the most-watched cable news network, period.&quot;

In November 2021, a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate described Newsmax as being among &quot;ten fringe publishers&quot; that together were responsible for nearly 70 percent of Facebook user interactions with content that denies climate change. Facebook disputed the study&#x27;s methodology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porterfield_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toxic_Ten_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in November 2021, Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson falsely tweeted that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine contained luciferase &quot;so that you can be tracked.&quot; This echoed earlier false social media claims that the vaccine supposedly had satanic links due to &quot;lucifer&quot; in luciferase and alleged references to &quot;666.&quot; Robinson&#x27;s tweet began with the salutation &quot;Dear Christians&quot; and referred her over 400,000 followers to the Book of Revelation; in a tweet days earlier, she equated vaccines with the Mark of the Beast. Twitter removed the tweet that day and suspended Robinson&#x27;s account for seven days, citing &quot;repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,&quot; as Newsmax sought to distance itself from her remark and removed her from the air pending an inquiry. Robinson returned to Twitter after her suspension to continue spreading COVID-19 misinformation, causing Twitter to permanently ban her within hours. Newsmax announced the next month that it would not renew Robinson&#x27;s contract when it ended in January 2022.

In May 2023 the &quot;small conservative cable news channel saw its ratings surge&quot; once again in response to actions by Fox News: &quot;Fox’s decision to fire [Tucker] Carlson.&quot; Newsmax&#x27;s viewership during the prime-time spot vacated by Carlson more than doubled. This increase surpassed the 2020 post-election surge and on a night-by-night basis they challenged CNN through the month to be the third-most-watched cable news channel (behind MSNBC and Fox). On November 1, 2023, Newsmax placed its live content behind a paywall on YouTube (&quot;Newsmax 2&quot;) while still offering a free streaming channel (&quot;Newsmax+).

In March 2024, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that between 2019 and 2020, a member of the Qatari Royal Family had invested $50 million in the network in the midst of the Qatar diplomatic crisis. It also reported that network leaders had told staffers to soften coverage related to Qatar following the investment, a claim the network later denied in response to the report.

In April 2024, Newsmax was included as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit by a man who was falsely identified as the perpetrator of the 2023 Allen, Texas mall shooting, alongside others such as Fox News and &quot;InfoWars&quot; personality Owen Shroyer. The man alleged the defendants had &quot;recklessly disregarded basic journalistic safeguards and published the photo of an innocent man, branding him as a neo-Nazi murderer to his local community and the nation at large.&quot;

==== 2020 election lawsuits ====
In December 2020, Newsmax was included as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit by Dominion executive Eric Coomer. Coomer asserted that the defendants had characterized him as a &quot;traitor&quot; and that as a result he was subjected to &quot;multiple credible death threats&quot;. In April 2021, Newsmax published a retraction and apology on its website, saying it &quot;found no evidence&quot; to support the allegations against Coomer.

In August 2021, Dominion sued Newsmax for &quot;knowingly and continuously&quot; promoting false election fraud narratives. Newsmax said in a statement that it had &quot;simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress&quot;, adding: &quot;Dominion&#x27;s action today is a clear attempt to squelch such reporting and undermine a free press&quot;. The case is set to go to trial in September 2024.

In November 2021, Smartmatic sued Newsmax for defamation. In August 2023, a Delaware judge rejected Newsmax&#x27;s bid to narrow the alleged defamatory statements cited by Smartmatic. The trial was set to begin on September 30, 2024. Newsmax and Smartmatic settled the suit on confidential terms on September 26.

=== Initial public offering ===
On June 10, 2024, during its coverage of a rally organized in Las Vegas by former and future president Donald Trump, Newsmax announced it plans to file for an initial public stock offering either in late 2024 or early 2025. The plan was confirmed on September 5, 2024, with the company expected to be listed under the ticker symbol &quot;NMAX&quot; on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of 2025. In November 2024, Newsmax offered preferred stock to accredited investors in an effort to raise $100 million. On January 25, 2025, the offering was extended to $200 million.

== Reception ==

In 2009, editor Michael Massing of the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; stated that &quot;Far-right Web sites like World Net Daily and Newsmax.com floated all kinds of specious stories about Obama that quickly careened around the blogosphere and onto talk radio. One particular favorite was the claim that Bill Ayers ghost-wrote &quot;Dreams From My Father&quot;.&quot;

In March 2009, &quot;MarketWatch&quot;&#x27;s media critic Jon Friedman stated that &quot;Newsmax has flourished because Ruddy has exhibited a stronger commitment to the bottom line than to presenting himself as an ideologue.&quot;

In 2010, Nielsen Online said Newsmax was the most trafficked conservative website with approximately 4 million unique visitors monthly. Alexa Internet statistics for Newsmax.com indicate that the readership consists mainly of Internet users over the age of 45, which aligns itself to the average age of Republican leaning voters, as gathered by The Pew Research Center.

Former president Bill Clinton, who described Newsmax&#x27;s CEO Ruddy as a friend, made headlines when he visited Newsmax&#x27;s offices during the summer of 2010. When Sarah Palin stopped by the office for an interview, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; suggested the move was the clearest indication yet she was planning to run for president. According to the magazine, Newsmax is a major player in GOP politics, as seen during the 2012 primaries. Visitors have also included Rep. Michele Bachmann, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Sen. John Thune, Gov. Haley Barbour, Sen. Mitt Romney, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and former Sen. Rick Santorum, among others.

An April 2010 cover story for &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; featured Newsmax as a model of future media companies called &quot;Media Stations&quot; that offer their audience audio, video, digital, and even print content.

In March 2014, Newsmax was profiled in &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; by correspondent Karl Taro Greenfeld. The &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; story detailed Newsmax&#x27;s successful business model of targeting higher-incomed Baby boomers. The average age of a Newsmax online reader is 54.7 years of age. The profile detailed Newsmax&#x27;s plans to launch a linear and over-the-top (OTT) content cable channel, and suggested their revenue model which sells &quot;a smorgasbord of political, health, and financial information, self-help books, and even vitamin supplements&quot; could make the company uniquely competitive in this arena.

In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the relationship Ruddy, though not a registered Republican, had with President Donald Trump as a significant influence: &quot;...with his dual role as a newsman and a close friend&quot;.

In 2019, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; reported, &quot;There are currently about 15 to 20 conservative websites which attract at least one million unique visitors per month. Some are venerable right-wing reliables like &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, or Newsmax. Others, like Infowars, The Gateway Pundit, Big League Politics, and Breitbart, mine the far fringes of the right.&quot;

The 2023 U.S. Trust in Media poll from YouGov and &quot;The Economist&quot; reports that Newsmax is the second-most trusted conservative news outlet for Republican voters, behind Fox News (a finding supported by Rasmussen Reports).

The Wikipedia community has categorized Newsmax as an unreliable source of information.

== Additional outlets ==
===Humanix Books===

Humanix Books is an American print and e-book publishing house and a division of Newsmax Media. The company publishes books in the areas of health, personal finance, current affairs, and politics. Books by the company are distributed by Two Rivers Distribution.

The company began operations in 1969. The first titles by the company were published in response to the need for higher quality classroom materials to support learning. In 2012 the company was acquired by Newsmax Media and shortly after Anthony Ziccardi was named the publisher of Humanix Books. The company released &quot;The ObamaCare Survival Guide&quot; by Nick J. Tate that same year. The book is about the arguments against the Affordable Care Act and it became a number one New York Times Best Seller in the Paperback Advice &amp; Misc. category for paperback books. In 2015 Mary Glenn replaced Anthony Ziccardi as the publisher of the company. In 2019, Adam Keith Pfeffer was named the deputy publisher of the company.

===&quot;Newsmax&quot; magazine===
Newsmax Media publishes &quot;Newsmax&quot; magazine, which the company describes as &quot;offering Americans the perspective they need on current events, politics, health, money, and lifestyle.&quot; The company reports a monthly readership of almost one million on their paid subscription products, including &quot;Newsmax&quot; magazine and multiple finance- and health-focused newsletters.

===Newsmax TV===

In 2014, Newsmax Media announced they would be starting a new television news channel that would be marketed to compete with Fox News Channel. It was launched as Newsmax TV in June 2014 with 8 hours of live programming daily, available through the Dish Network and DirecTV as well as for free on the Newsmax website.

===Newsmax Adria===
 was a partnership between Newsmax Media and United Media that began operating in June 2020. The new partnership operated in most of the former Yugoslav countries. It produced a newly retitled daily news bulletins &quot;Dnevnik Newsmax Adria&quot; on Nova BH in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and evening magazine program &quot;Pregled dana&quot; on Nova S in Serbia. Alongside N1 and Nova S, Newsmax Adria acted as a rival to Telekom Srbija and regularly reported Serbia&#x27;s government corruption scandals. It ceased production in October 2022.

In September 2024, Newsmax announced that it would resume operation in Serbia in October as Newsmax Balkans.

<text>Logan Circle is a historic roundabout park and neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located in Northwest D.C. The majority of Logan Circle is primarily residential, except for the highly-commercialized 14th Street corridor that passes through the western part of the neighborhood. In the 21st century, Logan Circle has been the focus of urban redevelopment and become one of Washington&#x27;s most expensive neighborhoods. Today, Logan Circle is also one of D.C.&#x27;s most prominent gay neighborhoods.

Logan Circle includes two historic districts, as well as numerous sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as D.C. Historic Landmarks. The circle&#x27;s origins date to the 1870&#x27;s, when the area was developed as a residential neighborhood to serve Washington&#x27;s growing bourgeoisie. In 1901, President William McKinley inaugurated the General Logan equestrian statue at the center of the circle&#x27;s park. In 1930, the U.S. Congress officially named the circle in honor of Union General John A. Logan.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===

During the Civil War, present-day Logan Circle was home to Camp Barker, former barracks converted into a refugee camp for newly freed enslaved people from nearby Virginia and Maryland. In the 1870s, streets, elm trees, and other amenities were installed by Washington Mayor Alexander Robey Shepherd, who encouraged the development of the area. Streetcar tracks were laid into what was then a very swampy area north of downtown Washington, to encourage development of the original Washington City Plan. As a result, the area saw development of successive blocks of Victorian row houses marketed to the upper middle class, which sought to give Washington the reputation, modeled after European capitals, of a city of broad boulevards and well-manicured parks. Many of the larger and more ornate homes came with carriage houses and attached servant&#x27;s quarters, which were later converted to apartments and rooming houses as the upper middle class moved elsewhere.

=== 20th century ===

Originally known as Iowa Circle, the park was renamed by Congress in 1930 in honor of John A. Logan, Commander of the Army of the Tennessee during the Civil War, Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, and U.S. representative and senator for the state of Illinois, who lived at 4 Logan Circle. At the center of the circle stands &quot;Major General John A. Logan&quot;, an equestrian statue of Logan sculpted by Franklin Simmons and a bronze statue base designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt. On April 9, 1901, the 25-foot monument was dedicated by President William McKinley, Senator Chauncey Depew, and General Grenville M. Dodge.

In the early 20th century, 14th Street NW rose to prominence as a main shopping district for both black and white Washingtonians on the edge of downtown Washington D.C., and became known as an area for auto showrooms. Farther north, &quot;14th and U&quot; became synonymous with a large African-American community, later known as Shaw, which encompassed parts of Logan Circle and U Street to the north. Segregation marked the emergence of this large area of well-preserved Victorian row houses as a predominantly African-American community; the unofficial dividing line was 16th Street NW, several blocks to the west, with Logan Circle and its older homes sandwiched in between.

During this period, the original Victorian homes in the area were subdivided into apartments, hostels, and rooming houses. With the end of legal segregation, middle-class residents of both races left the area. Many left after the destructive 1968 Washington, D.C. riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. These devastated the 14th and U streets commercial corridors.

In 1956, the three inner lanes of 13th Street were paved across Logan Circle to speed the influx of suburban workers into DC. In 1980, to encourage more people to use Metro, the inner lanes across Logan Circle were closed. Later they were removed and the park restored.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Logan Circle, although dominated by Victorian homes that had survived mostly untouched by redevelopment or riots, was considered an unsafe neighborhood by many due to overt drug use and prostitution that existed in the neighborhood. During this period, property values in the area began to increase, but issues of homelessness in the area came to the forefront. Fourteenth Street, NW became widely viewed as Washington&#x27;s red light district. It also became an area for small, independent theater companies that acquired relatively cheap space north of the circle.

=== 21st century ===

During the 2000s, the area gentrified and housing costs sharply increased after derelict buildings were torn down or remodeled. The commercial corridors along 14th and P streets attracted significant revitalization. They now feature a variety of retailers, restaurants, art galleries, live theater, and nightlife venue gay bars catering to the neighborhood&#x27;s booming LGBT population.

A watershed event in the development of the neighborhood was the opening of a Whole Foods Market two blocks from Logan Circle in December 2000. No full grocery store was in the area. It was developed on a site previously occupied by an abandoned service garage; it is now one of the chain&#x27;s highest-grossing markets. Gentrification in Logan Circle has resulted in a dramatic change of neighborhood demographics; since the 1990s, thousands of White young LGBT and hipster adults have moved into the neighborhood, while thousands of Black families have moved out because of rising prices.

== Landmarks ==

=== Logan Circle Historic District ===

The Logan Circle Historic District is an eight-block area surrounding the circle, containing 135 late-19th-century residences designed predominantly in the Late Victorian and Richardsonian Romanesque styles of architecture. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1972.

The former home of Mary McLeod Bethune, an African American educator, author, and civil rights leader who founded the National Council of Negro Women, is located at 1318 Vermont Avenue NW, one block south of the circle. The Second Empire-style building is a designated National Historic Site and houses the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Museum and the National Archives for Black Women&#x27;s History.

=== Fourteenth Street Historic District ===

In addition to the Logan Circle Historic District, the neighborhood includes the much larger Fourteenth Street Historic District, added to the NRHP in 1994. The district&#x27;s approximately 765 contributing properties are considered historically significant because they represent residential and commercial development resulting from one of the earliest streetcar lines in Washington, D.C., the Capital Traction Company&#x27;s 14th Street line, built in the 1880s.

The oldest house of worship in the Fourteenth Street Historic District is Luther Place Memorial Church, built 1870–1873, an ELCA Lutheran church situated on the north side of Thomas Circle. Originally known as Memorial Evangelical Lutheran Church of Washington, D.C., the building was renamed in 1884 after a bronze statue of Martin Luther was installed on the church&#x27;s property. Luther Place Memorial Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 16, 1973.

The Gladstone and Hawarden, designed by architect George S. Cooper in 1900, are early examples of Washington&#x27;s middle class apartment houses. Named for U.K. Prime Minister William Gladstone and his estate Hawarden Castle, they are the first documented twin apartment buildings in Washington, D.C. The Gladstone and Hawarden were added to the NRHP on September 7, 1994.

=== Other landmarks ===
The District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites includes several properties in Logan Circle that are not listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among them are the former residences of: Charles Manuel &quot;Sweet Daddy&quot; Grace, flamboyant founder of the United House of Prayer For All People; John A. Lankford, the first African American architect in Washington, D.C.; Belford Lawson Jr., lead attorney in the landmark case &quot;New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.&quot;; Alain LeRoy Locke, the first African American Rhodes Scholar and central figure in the Harlem Renaissance; Mary Jane Patterson, the first African American woman to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree; Ella Watson, subject of Gordon Parks&#x27;s famous photograph &quot;American Gothic, Washington, D.C.&quot;; and James Lesesne Wells, noted graphic artist and longtime art instructor at Howard University.

The Victorian building on the north side of the park, 15 Logan Circle, was built for military officer and diplomat Seth Ledyard Phelps and served as the Korean legation from 1889 to 1905. Following an extensive restoration project, the building now serves as the Old Korean Legation Museum.

The Iowa, designed by Thomas Franklin Schneider in 1901, was the birthplace of anthropologist Julian Steward.

== Demographics ==

The racial composition of the neighborhood is in flux, paralleling its gentrification, with the Black population decreasing from around one quarter to around one tenth of the population (2010 to 2020), while the non-Hispanic White proportion increased by around a fifth, going from around 59% to around 70% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population during those ten years. The Asian population was up 9%,

<text>:: &quot;For the Korean War battles, see Battle of Pork Chop Hill.&quot;
Pork Chop Hill is a 1959 American Korean War film starring Gregory Peck, Woody Strode, Rip Torn, and George Peppard. The film, which was the final war film directed by Lewis Milestone, is based upon the 1956 book by U.S. military historian Brigadier General S. L. A. Marshall. It depicts the first fierce Battle of Pork Chop Hill between the U.S. Army&#x27;s 7th Infantry Division and Chinese and North Korean forces in April 1953.

The film features numerous actors who would go on to become movie and television stars in the 1960s and the 1970s such as Woody Strode, Harry Guardino, Robert Blake, George Peppard, Norman Fell, Abel Fernandez, Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, and Clarence Williams III. It is also the screen debut of Martin Landau and George Shibata, who was a West Point classmate of Lieutenant Joe Clemons, who also acted as technical adviser on the film.

==Plot==
In April 1953, during the Korean War, K Company, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, under the command of Lieutenant Joe Clemons, is assigned to recapture Pork Chop Hill from a larger Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army force. Clemons leads 2nd Platoon, while putting his friend and Executive Officer, Lieutenant Tsugio Ohashi in charge of 1st Platoon, while 3rd Platoon is kept as a reserve. They succeed in taking the hill, trench by trench, but at the cost of high casualties. Clemons is promised another company as reinforcements, but L Company is ambushed, and only about a dozen infantrymen reach him. They prepare for a large-scale Chicom counterattack, with only 25 men left out of the whole company.

Meanwhile, at nearby Panmunjeom, cease-fire negotiations continue, and U.S. Army High Command are unwilling to reinforce the hill because its value is not worth further losses. Yet they will not abandon the hill either, because it is a point of negotiation in the talks. Eventually, American negotiators come to the conclusion that the Chinese are pouring soldiers into the battle for a militarily insignificant hill to test the resolve of the Americans. Thus, the decision is made to reinforce the hill, saving the lives of the survivors of Clemons&#x27;s unit.

==Production==
The film was based on Marshall&#x27;s book &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; published in 1956. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;unforgettable&quot;.

In August 1957 the film rights were bought by Melville Productions, the film company of Gregory Peck. Sy Bartlett was to produce and James Webb was to write the script. It was Webb who recommended the project to Melville. He decided to focus the action on Company K, who took up a chapter in the book, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, over a 24-hour period.

S.L.A. Marshall reportedly disliked the fact that he had sold the movie rights to his book for next-to-nothing, and vowed not to make the same mistake again.

In January 1958 Lewis Milestone agreed to direct. He and Bartlett wanted to cast unknowns in support of Peck and saw over 600 actors for 83 speaking parts.

Strode and Edwards&#x27; portrayal of African American soldiers is based on the 24th Infantry Regiment, which was still racially segregated in Korea. All Black units were integrated in the summer and fall of 1951 and all Black units were integrated and closed out on 1 October 1951. Like its cinematic portrayal, the real regiment was poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly led. More than once when this all-black unit was placed on the front lines, a unit in reserve was positioned directly behind because they were expected to break. The regiment was finally considered so unreliable it was disbanded. Its personnel were reassigned to other combat units just as in the film, which portrays Edwards&#x27; character - with good leadership - becoming an effective soldier.

===Casting choices===
George Shibata, who stars as Lt. Suki Ohashi, became the first Nisei appointed to West Point through the sponsorship of Sen. Elbert D. Thomas. Shibata would become the first Asian American graduate of the United States Military Academy, Class of 1951 and he was commissioned in the United States Air Force later in that same year (1951). During the Korean War he flew an F-86 Sabre out of Taegu Air Force Base. The film Pork Chop Hill was about Shibata&#x27;s classmate Joseph G. Clemons, who was also a 1951 West Point graduate. This came about when Clemons accidentally bumped into his old friend Shibata at a drugstore when Clemons was in California acting as a technical adviser for the forthcoming film. He convinced Shibata to try out for the role of the Japanese-Hawaiian Executive Officer, Lt. Tsugio Ohashi when Hollywood was having a problem casting the role. During the production Clemons decided to play a joke on his Air Force pilot classmate whose accommodations during the war were more comfortable than Clemons&#x27; by ensuring that Shibata wore the only actual flak jacket in the film; the other cast members wearing foam rubber reproductions.

The film was the second feature film for George Peppard.
===Filming===
Filming started 19 May 1958. Some of the location shooting was conducted in California near Westlake Village and in San Fernando Valley. Two months before filming the unit moved into an Albertson Company Ranch where the bulk of the film was to be shot and created a series of trenches.

Peck, although not credited, directed a few scenes despite protests by Milestone.

Milestone called it his &quot;most interesting job in a long time.&quot;

The film had an allocated shooting schedule of 40 days and ended up needing another 15 days.

===Clash between Peck and Milestone===
Peck and Milestone clashed during filming over Peck&#x27;s performance; the director wanted Peck to play his character as more insecure while Peck wanted a more conventional approach. Before the film&#x27;s premier in May 1959, United Artists cut the film by nearly 20 minutes. Director Lewis Milestone claimed changes were made because Veronique Peck, the wife of star Gregory Peck, felt her husband made his first entrance too late into the picture. While that claim stands as unconfirmed, the film does show signs of post-production editing, with segments of several excised scenes showing up under the main title credits.

Milestone&#x27;s version reportedly featured more cross cutting between the fighting and the peace conference and made Peck&#x27;s character less of a conventional hero. The director says it also featured more scenes involving the Chinese.

==Release==
The film opened in Chicago and Detroit in the week ended May 26, 1959. It opened at the Roxy Theatre in New York City on May 29 and became number one in the US.

The film was a minor box office hit.

===Critical response===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded the film&#x27;s &quot;grim and rugged&quot; style, the way it captured the &quot;resentment&quot; of the American GIs, and how it &quot;tacitly points the obsoleteness of ground warfare&quot;.

<text>Mindanao State University (MSU; ) is a state university system in the city of Marawi, Philippines. It is the first state university in Mindanao, Philippines, established through Republic Act No. 1387 (as amended). It is the second state-sponsored institution in the country, following the University of the Philippines.

The MSU was formally established on September 1, 1961 in Marawi City, the capital of Lanao del Sur, which was claimed to be the heart of Morolandia due to the city being the site of the reference point of all roads in Mindanao.
The university was formally established with the first meeting of its Board of Regents in Marawi on August 19, 1961, that resulted into the election of the first president of the University in the person of Antonio S. Isidro, the then vice President for Academic Affairs of the University of the Philippines.

==History==
Mindanao State University (MSU) was established on September 1, 1961, through RA 1387, as amended. It was the brainchild of the late Senator Domocao Alonto, as one of the government&#x27;s responses to the so-called &quot;Mindanao Problem&quot;.

The original mission of the university was anchored on instruction, research, and extension. The 1954 Congressional Committee conceptualized it as a social laboratory for national integration.

The main campus in Marawi which started with 282 students and 12 faculty members in its pioneering classes in 1962, has now grown to a multi-campus supra-regional university system, serving over 69,000 students in all levels with nearly 3,100 faculty members.

It is the only university directly charged by the government to advance the cause of national unity and actively pursue integration through education.

Today, MSU has units in areas which cut across the Mindanao regions. From a one campus university in Marawi, MSU has grown to a multi-campus university of eight autonomous campuses: MSU-Main in Marawi, MSU-IIT in Iligan, MSU-TCTO in Tawi-Tawi, MSU-Naawan in Misamis Oriental, MSU-Maguindanao, MSU-General Santos, MSU-Sulu in Jolo, MSU Buug in Zamboanga Sibugay, and MSU-Bataraza in Palawan.

The mandates of the university are:
* To perform the traditional functions of a university namely: instruction, research and extension service.
* To help accelerate the program of the integration among the peoples of the Southern Philippines, particularly the Muslims and other cultural minorities.
* To provide trained manpower skills and technical know-how for the economic development of the Mindanao, Sulu and Palawan (MINSUPALA) region in Bangsamoro.

The initial batch of students to enroll in the University on June 13, 1962, passed the scholarship examination administered by the National Science Development Board. The 282 freshmen students were in the top 5% of their high schools in the MINSUPALA region in Bangsamoro. Their teachers were 12 regular Filipino faculty members and a number of volunteers from the U.S. Peace Corps, British Voluntary Service Overseas, Volunteers in Asia, Ford Foundation, Fulbright Foundation and others. Baccalaureate courses were offered by the pioneering colleges: Liberal Arts, Education and Community Development to which four more were added in the subsequent school year 1964–65 – Agriculture, Fisheries, Business Administration and Engineering. In July 1969, the College of Forestry was added.

To meet the growing demands of the region, 16 major colleges were created offering 248 courses.

On January 10, 2001, three CHED supervised institutions — Lanao del Norte Agricultural College (LNAC), Lanao National College of Arts and Trades (LNCAT), and Maigo School of Arts and Trades (MSAT) — were integrated into the MSU System by virtue of CHED Order No. 27 S. 2000 and Republic Act No. 8760.

Classes were temporarily suspended due to the Battle of Marawi which started in May 2017. Some students, faculty, and personnel were evacuated to nearby MSU-IIT in Iligan while others went home to their provinces during the ongoing conflict. The school was unable to hold summer classes in the campus. However, regular in-campus classes resumed in August of the same year after a successful Balik MSU: Somombak Tano sa Pantaw a Mareg campaign to allow faculty and students to return to the campus amidst the ongoing war with security being strictly monitored. The battle in the city officially ended later in October.

On December 3, 2023, a bombing occurred in Dimaporo Gymnasium during a Catholic mass. Four people were confirmed dead and at least 40 people were injured. Classes were temporarily suspended until further notice; as a result, students, faculty, and personnel were repatriated to their home provinces following the incident. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

<text>A technical decision is a term used in boxing when a fight has to be stopped because of a headbutt.

In mixed martial arts, a technical decision occurs when a fighter is rendered unable to continued by a foul and the majority of the final round has already been completed.

==MMA==
==Boxing==

Boxing referees must pay close attention to the action between fighters, especially when they are fighting close to each other, because if a fighter is cut, the referee must decide whether it was caused by a punch or a head collision. Only the referee can make that decision.

Most head collisions in boxing are unintentional, especially when both boxers are trying for a knockout and/or fighting at close range. An intentional head butt is considered a flagrant foul that can result in disqualification of the offender.

In the case of a cut to the head, the referee must consult the ringside physician as many times as the referee thinks necessary, whether or not the referee decides the cut was caused by a punch. If the doctor decides that the fighter cannot continue, the referee must stop the fight. If the referee decides that a punch caused the cut, the other boxer wins by technical knockout. If the referee decides it was produced by an unintentional headbutt, then so long as the fight has gone the required distance under the rules in effect for that fight, the judges at ringside must hand over their scorecards (including scores for the incomplete round), and the fighter ahead on points wins by technical decision.

If an intentional foul causes an injury where the contest is allowed to continue, but the fighter is unable to continue in a subsequent round, special rules are imposed once the fight has reached official status. If the fighter who is unable to continue is ahead on points, he wins. If the fighter is behind or tied, the fight is declared a technical draw because the fighter who deliberately fouls is ineligible to win.

The rules governing the required distance for a fighter to be declared a winner by technical decision vary by federation. Some require the fight to be in at least the fourth round; others (and most championship fights) require the fight to be past the halfway point (i.e., five rounds for a 10-round match; six rounds for a 12-round match). If a fight is stopped because of an unintentional headbutt without reaching the required distance, it is automatically declared a technical draw. Generally, every country where boxing is practiced accepts the four round or the halfway point as the right distance for a fight to be won or lost by technical decisions.

A unique case happened between world champions Daniel Santos and Antonio Margarito: &quot;both&quot; of their fights ended in technical decisions, which is very rare in boxing. Their first bout was declared a draw, as it had gone only one minute before being stopped, and Santos won by a ten-round split technical decision in their rematch.

One of the most controversial technical decisions in boxing history occurred in May 1994, when Julio César Chávez regained the World Boxing Council Light Welterweight title over his previous conqueror, Frankie Randall. Large percentages of both members of the media and the Pay Per View public had Randall ahead by a substantial amount when the fight was stopped in the eighth round by a cut on Chávez&#x27;s head, but the judges viewed the fight otherwise, giving the fight to Chávez by a split technical decision. Boxing magazines such as &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;KO&quot; criticized the judges, particularly judge Ray Solis, for scoring the fight for Chávez.

<doc id="978638" wikidata="Q2973653" url="?curid=978638" title="Division of Hotham">
<text>The Division of Hotham is an Australian electoral division in Victoria. It is located in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Hotham covers an area of approximately 83 square kilometres from Oakleigh in the north to Keysborough in the south. The division includes the suburbs of Bentleigh East, Clarinda, Clayton South, Coatesville, Huntingdale, Noble Park, Oakleigh East, Oakleigh South, Springvale,Waverley Park, Westall in their entirety; as well as parts of Bentleigh, Clayton, Hughesdale, Keysborough, Mulgrave, Noble Park North, Oakleigh and Springvale South.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The Division includes parts of the local government areas of Glen Eira City Council, Greater Dandenong City Council, Kingston City Council and Monash City Council.

==History==

The division was created in 1969 and is named for Sir Charles Hotham, Governor of Victoria 1854–55. The division was originally created as a reconfigured version of the Division of Higinbotham, and as such was on paper a safe Liberal seat. The last member for Higinbotham, prominent Liberal Don Chipp, transferred to Hotham. Chips served as a minister under John Gorton, William McMahon and Malcolm Fraser—as well as Harold Holt and John McEwen while he held his old seat. He ended up quitting the party in 1977 due to personal animosity towards Fraser to form the Australian Democrats, and shortly thereafter transferred to the Senate.

Demographic changes resulted in the seat nearly being lost to Labor in 1977 despite a national Coalition landslide. Chipp&#x27;s Liberal successor Roger Johnston finally lost Hotham to Labor in 1980. Labor has held the seat since then, and consolidated its hold on the seat in the 1990s to make it one of the party&#x27;s safer seats in Melbourne. 

Besides Chipp, the seat&#x27;s most prominent member was Simon Crean, who was Opposition Leader from 2001 until December 2003 and was in every Labor Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet from June 1991 to March 2013. Crean retired at the 2013 election and was succeeded by fellow Labor member Clare O&#x27;Neil. Since 2022, O&#x27;Neil has been the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security in the Albanese Labor Government.

<text>The Canterbury Railway Society is an organisation of railway enthusiasts based in the Canterbury region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, best known for their operation of The Ferrymead Railway at the Ferrymead Heritage Park.

==Beginnings==
The Canterbury branch of the New Zealand Railway &amp; Locomotive Society was formed in the late 1950s. In its early years, one of its major activities was in the operation of passenger excursions on the national rail network, then operated by the New Zealand Railways Department. In that era, there were far more excursion trains than there are today, and far more railway lines in general, including the many branch lines that were closed in the 1960s and 1970s. Steam traction was used in the South Island for longer than in the North Island, and a variety of motive power could be found on any of these trains.

Aside from a handful of locomotives placed on public display, little thought up to this time had been given to any serious notion of rail preservation. The catalyst proved to be the wholesale scrapping of steam traction which began in the mid 1950s and continued until 1971 when the last JA class locomotives were withdrawn from the Main South Line. In addition at this time, a large number of branch lines were closed and ripped up, and some of the earliest preservation efforts were based on these closed lines, while others took advantage of the opportunity to obtain cheap supplies of recovered rail materials for use elsewhere.

The idea of becoming involved in railway preservation in New Zealand did not become a reality for any group in New Zealand until the 1960s, when New Zealand Railways accelerated the pace of dieselisation, resulting in wholesale scrapping of its steam locomotive fleet. At that time, there was a nationwide move to save railway equipment which resulted in the large-scale purchase of locomotives and rolling stock and the establishment of the major preservation sites in New Zealand.

==Ferrymead Railway==
The Ferrymead Railway has been the main project of the Canterbury branch since 1964. The railway has been established on the historical site of New Zealand&#x27;s first public railway which opened in 1863 and closed in 1867. The railway runs from a station at the Ferrymead Heritage Park Edwardian village north-east to a small station alongside the Heathcote River. Work on the site had progressed sufficiently far by 1972 to allow train running to begin, and the railway officially opened in 1977. It was the major focus of 1988&#x27;s Rail 125 commemorations, a celebration of 125 years of railways in New Zealand, and it has hosted numerous local events since, often in conjunction with the Ferrymead Heritage Park or other rail preservation societies.

==Other activities==
As noted above, excursion trains were a major early activity of the Canterbury branch. It also held monthly members&#x27; meetings, often on railway premises, and organised special conventions and festivals. In the diesel era, the most notable of these was the aforementioned Rail 125. Passenger shuttle services and excursions operated daily throughout the week of this festival, which was attended by locomotives, rolling stock and railfans from all around the country. Following the reintroduction of excursions to the NZR mainline in the late 1970s, the branch or individual members operated a number of diesel hauled trains, and were well placed to take advantage of the reintroduction of mainline steam in the mid 1980s.

Changes in New Zealand Railway &amp; Locomotive Society (NZRLS) membership rules in 1984 resulted in the elimination of membership of Local Branches of the NZRLS. When the requirement for full membership of the parent society began to be enforced there was a move for the Canterbury Branch to follow the lead of the former Auckland, Wellington and Otago branches and form a separate Society. Constitutional amendments were passed in 1990 which resulted in the branch becoming the independent Canterbury Railway Society.

During the 1990s, the restructuring and privatisation of New Zealand Railways had a major impact upon the activities of many rail societies. Excursion train costs rose substantially and the number of such trains operated annually dropped off dramatically. Such trains then became mainly the preserve of two or three larger organisations with their own passenger carriage and/or locomotive fleets. Changes in employment law and working patterns for most New Zealand citizens resulted also in a major reduction in voluntary resources for groups all around the country. In general, this has resulted in most other activities of the Canterbury Railway Society dropping away, and the Society is now exclusively based at Ferrymead and forms most of its activities around the site.

In addition:
*In June 1998, a year after the end of the Otira electrification EOs 45 and 74 were leased to the CRS for storage and display in June 1998. In November 1999 EOs 39, 51 and 68 were transferred to Ferrymead as well. 45, 68 and 74 operated at the park ark on a number of times occasions including Easter Weekend in 2000. Three of the EOs were moved to Picton in 2004 while the other two stayed until 2008.

<doc id="978650" wikidata="Q36248" url="?curid=978650" title="Triple product">
<text>In geometry and algebra, the triple product is a product of three 3-dimensional vectors, usually Euclidean vectors. The name &quot;triple product&quot; is used for two different products, the scalar-valued scalar triple product and, less often, the vector-valued vector triple product.

== Scalar triple product ==
The scalar triple product (also called the mixed product, box product, or triple scalar product) is defined as the dot product of one of the vectors with the cross product of the other two.

=== Geometric interpretation ===
Geometrically, the scalar triple product
:formula_1
is the (signed) volume of the parallelepiped defined by the three vectors given.

=== Properties ===
* The scalar triple product is unchanged under a circular shift of its three operands (a, b, c):
*:formula_2
* Swapping the positions of the operators without re-ordering the operands leaves the triple product unchanged. This follows from the preceding property and the commutative property of the dot product:
*:formula_3
* Swapping any two of the three operands negates the triple product. This follows from the circular-shift property and the anticommutativity of the cross product:
*:formula_4
* The scalar triple product can also be understood as the determinant of the matrix that has the three vectors either as its rows or its columns (a matrix has the same determinant as its transpose):
*:formula_5
* If the scalar triple product is equal to zero, then the three vectors a, b, and c are coplanar, since the parallelepiped defined by them would be flat and have no volume.
* If any two vectors in the scalar triple product are equal, then its value is zero:
*:formula_6
* Also:
*:formula_7
* The simple product of two triple products (or the square of a triple product), may be expanded in terms of dot products:formula_8This restates in vector notation that the product of the determinants of two 3×3 matrices equals the determinant of their matrix product. As a special case, the square of a triple product is a Gram determinant.
*The ratio of the triple product and the product of the three vector norms is known as a polar sine:formula_9which ranges between −1 and 1.

===Scalar or pseudoscalar===
Although the scalar triple product gives the volume of the parallelepiped, it is the signed volume, the sign depending on the orientation of the frame or the parity of the permutation of the vectors. This means the product is negated if the orientation is reversed, for example by a parity transformation, and so is more properly described as a pseudoscalar if the orientation can change.

This also relates to the handedness of the cross product; the cross product transforms as a pseudovector under parity transformations and so is properly described as a pseudovector. The dot product of two vectors is a scalar but the dot product of a pseudovector and a vector is a pseudoscalar, so the scalar triple product (of vectors) must be pseudoscalar-valued.

If T is a proper rotation then
:formula_10
but if T is an improper rotation then
:formula_11

===Scalar or scalar density===
Strictly speaking, a scalar does not change at all under a coordinate transformation. (For example, the factor of 2 used for doubling a vector does not change if the vector is in spherical vs. rectangular coordinates.) However, if each vector is transformed by a matrix then the triple product ends up being multiplied by the determinant of the transformation matrix, which could be quite arbitrary for a non-rotation. That is, the triple product is more properly described as a scalar density.

===As an exterior product===

In exterior algebra and geometric algebra the exterior product of two vectors is a bivector, while the exterior product of three vectors is a trivector. A bivector is an oriented plane element and a trivector is an oriented volume element, in the same way that a vector is an oriented line element.

Given vectors a, b and c, the product
:formula_12
is a trivector with magnitude equal to the scalar triple product, i.e.
:formula_13,

and is the Hodge dual of the scalar triple product. As the exterior product is associative brackets are not needed as it does not matter which of or is calculated first, though the order of the vectors in the product does matter. Geometrically the trivector a ∧ b ∧ c corresponds to the parallelepiped spanned by a, b, and c, with bivectors , and matching the parallelogram faces of the parallelepiped.

===As a trilinear function===
The triple product is identical to the volume form of the Euclidean 3-space applied to the vectors via interior product. It also can be expressed as a contraction of vectors with a rank-3 tensor equivalent to the form (or a pseudotensor equivalent to the volume pseudoform); see below.

== Vector triple product ==
The vector triple product is defined as the cross product of one vector with the cross product of the other two. The following relationship holds:

:formula_14.

This is known as triple product expansion, or Lagrange&#x27;s formula, although the latter name is also used for several other formulas. Its right hand side can be remembered by using the mnemonic &quot;ACB − ABC&quot;, provided one keeps in mind which vectors are dotted together. A proof is provided below. Some textbooks write the identity as formula_15 such that a more familiar mnemonic &quot;BAC − CAB&quot; is obtained, as in “back of the cab”.

Since the cross product is anticommutative, this formula may also be written (up to permutation of the letters) as:

:formula_16

From Lagrange&#x27;s formula it follows that the vector triple product satisfies:

:formula_17

which is the Jacobi identity for the cross product. Another useful formula follows:

:formula_18

These formulas are very useful in simplifying vector calculations in physics. A related identity regarding gradients and useful in vector calculus is Lagrange&#x27;s formula of vector cross-product identity:
:formula_19

This can be also regarded as a special case of the more general Laplace–de Rham operator formula_20.

===Proof===
The formula_21 component of formula_22 is given by:

:formula_23

Similarly, the formula_24 and formula_25 components of formula_26 are given by:

:formula_27

By combining these three components we obtain:

:formula_28

===Using geometric algebra===
If geometric algebra is used the cross product b × c of vectors is expressed as their exterior product b∧c, a bivector. The second cross product cannot be expressed as an exterior product, otherwise the scalar triple product would result. Instead a left contraction can be used, so the formula becomes

:formula_29

The proof follows from the properties of the contraction. The result is the same vector as calculated using a × (b × c).

== Interpretations ==

=== Tensor calculus ===
In tensor notation, the triple product is expressed using the Levi-Civita symbol:
formula_30
and
formula_31
referring to the formula_32-th component of the resulting vector. This can be simplified by performing a contraction on the Levi-Civita symbols, formula_33
where formula_34 is the Kronecker delta function (formula_35 when formula_36 and formula_37 when formula_38) and formula_39 is the generalized Kronecker delta function. We can reason out this identity by recognizing that the index formula_40 will be summed out leaving only formula_32 and formula_42. In the first term, we fix formula_43 and thus formula_44. Likewise, in the second term, we fix formula_45 and thus formula_46.

Returning to the triple cross product,
formula_47

=== Vector calculus ===

Consider the flux integral of the vector field formula_48 across the parametrically-defined surface formula_49: formula_50. The unit normal vector formula_51 to the surface is given by formula_52, so the integrand formula_53 is a scalar triple product.

<text>Cross County Center is an open-air shopping mall located at the junction of the NYS Thruway and Cross County Parkway, in the Kimball neighborhood of Yonkers, New York, United States. The mall is managed by Marx Realty and hosts over 100 stores and restaurants. Anchor stores are Macy&#x27;s and Target. The mall features prominent specialty retailers such as Armani Exchange, Zara, Michael Kors, Guess, Invicta Watch, and Steve Madden, in addition to Showcase Cinemas.

==History==
Developed by Sol Atlas, Cross County Center opened in 1954 as one of the nation&#x27;s first open-air shopping destinations. Its parking lot was built atop a former peat bog. The 72-acre site included the Cross County Hospital in the middle of the mall campus complete with a rooftop helipad (the hospital closed in the early 1980s).

The original anchor stores were Gimbels (later Stern&#x27;s, now Macy&#x27;s), John Wanamaker (later Sears, now Target), and F. W. Woolworth Company. Woolworth operated a main store and a garden store in the mall (the former is now mall space, while the latter was converted to Odd-Job Trading before becoming Old Navy). In September 1954, the women&#x27;s clothing store Russeks opened a store in the shopping center, selling women&#x27;s sportswear, dresses, coats, suits, furs, millinery, and accessories, as well as children&#x27;s coats and dresses. The 1981 CBS TV movie Bill starring Mickey Rooney had the scene with Santa Claus filmed here.

Starting in 2007, Cross County Center underwent a new development and upgrade overseen by The Macerich Company on behalf of the mall&#x27;s owners, which was completed in 2012. The huge building that now houses Macy&#x27;s Department Store (that was initially Gimbel&#x27;s and then Stern&#x27;s) has been enlarged by one third. It also features a new covered parking lot that is almost as large as the store; the underground loading complex has also been enlarged. The buildings housing the stores on Mall Walk have been renovated and look different, externally, than they did previously, and the catwalk around some second floor stores has been permanently removed. All of the smaller stores, such a those that housed cookie shops and lingerie stores, have been demolished. Nearby buildings have been extended, and one parking lot now faces several large stores.

The former Cross County Hospital and Office building was reconstructed for a Hyatt Place hotel, with 155 rooms, an indoor pool, cocktails bar, business center and fitness center in 2015.

In 2010, Red Lobster opened, and in 2015, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants opened. On the north side of the mall, Wilsker&#x27;s restaurant was located, and it was a diner.

On June 6, 2019, it was announced that Sears would shutter as part of an ongoing decision to eliminate its brick-and-mortar format. Target signed a 40-year lease for 132,000 sq. ft. of space in the previous Sears outpost. On September 13, 2023, Target announced that they will open their first store on October 22 on the location of the former Sears store. The store had its ribbon cut on October 18, and opened 4 days later.

The mall has long been owned by Brooks Shopping Center LLC, jointly owned by Marx Realty and Benenson Capital Partners, and was managed by Macerich since 2006. On January 17, 2020, Westfair Communications reported that Marx Realty took over the mall&#x27;s leasing and management from Macerich.

In late 2021, it was announced that Westchester Community College would expand their current Yonkers campus by opening up a concept at Cross County on the third floor of the previous Sears outpost. WCC will add 30,000 square feet of space, using it to build new lab spaces, and new design school, and expand their current academic offerings at the campus. The WCC expansion opened in November 2022.

==Name==
&quot;Cross County Center&quot; is the official name of the shopping center.

==The Mall at Cross County==
Adjacent to Cross County Center, at 750 Central Park Avenue, is a shopping center called The Mall at Cross County, which hosts a variety of stores and a large covered parking garage. Current tenants include Michaels, Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, and Micro Center.

The mall first opened in 1987 as Cross County Square and had different stores than today, such as Thriftway Drug, Finders Keepers, Crazy Eddie, plus various specialty stores and restaurants.

Before 2009, the mall also hosted a Circuit City on the second floor.
In 2010, Micro Center opened where the Circuit City was.

Prior to 2017, the mall hosted a variety of stores and restaurants such as National Wholesale Liquidators, LensCrafters, Powerhouse Gym, GNC, Payless ShoeSource, Nail Pro, Pizza In The Square, Subway, Pretzel Time, and TCBY on the first floor, and Sports Authority, Kid City, Ideal Jewelers, and Sleepy&#x27;s on the second floor. Before 2004, the mall also hosted a Kids &quot;R&quot; Us, which was the children&#x27;s clothing chain owned by the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us brand.

In 2017, it was announced that, as part of a $10,000,000 renovation to the mall, Century 21 would open a store which covered up the whole interior part of the mall, closing all of the previous tenants mentioned above. On September 10, 2020, it was announced that Century 21 would be closing all of its stores, including the Mall at Cross County location. In November 2022, Burlington opened a store in the space formerly occupied by Century 21.

The National Wholesale Liquidators location, which was housed in a separate structure attached to the rest of the mall, closed in 2017 after a construction accident occurred when a front-loader fell through the unused portion of the roof parking deck on top of the store. The building was subsequently condemned and demolished, with plans to rebuild a new store. However, no timeline was disclosed for the construction of the new store, and as of 2021, the lot is still empty and construction has not begun.

<text>About a Burning Fire is the fourth album by post-hardcore band Blindside. It was released on February 24, 2004 through Elektra and 3 Points Records. The album charted at 39 on the Billboard top 200 which was even higher than their previous album, Silence which charted at 89 for 9 weeks straight. The album is also notable for featuring The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; Billy Corgan on the track &quot;Hooray, It&#x27;s L.A.&quot; as well as being featured on the soundtrack for the video game Need For Speed Underground.

&quot;All of Us&quot; became the album&#x27;s lead single. Its music video features a young man chasing after a woman through a dead, leafless forest. In his desperation, the man&#x27;s arms begin to stretch out to her in a feat similar to Mr. Fantastic&#x27;s. The video aired considerably on Fuse TV.

<doc id="978673" wikidata="Q2735147" url="?curid=978673" title="ZK-383">
<text>The ZK-383 is a submachine gun developed by the Koucký brothers, who worked at the pre-war &quot;Československá zbrojovka, akc.spol.&quot; (under its name of Zbrojovka Brno after World War II) arms factory in Brno, Czechoslovakia. It was produced at a slow rate from 1938 onwards and was exported as far away as Bolivia and Venezuela.

==History==

The ZK-383 was exported to many smaller European countries following its production start date in 1938. The production of the ZK-383 continued at Brno arms factory even during the German occupation during World War II. Most of the guns produced were supplied to the Waffen-SS. It continued to be produced in small numbers in the postwar period and production ended in 1948. The ZK-383 was slowly phased out by smaller and lighter submachine guns such as the Sa vz. 23. Bulgaria continued using it until the 1970s.

== Design ==

The ZK-383 was originally designed to be a squad automatic weapon much like the British Bren and Soviet DP27, despite it shooting a pistol round and not a full sized rifle cartridge. It became an individual submachine gun which resembles the German MP 18. For a submachine gun, the ZK-383 was a heavy and robustly made weapon. Military versions possessed detachable barrels, an integrated bipod, and rifle type sights, components considered unusual in submachineguns of the era. The police variant, designated the ZK-383-P, lacked these features, as did the postwar ZK-383-H.

== Features ==

The ZK-383 was fitted with a quickly detachable barrel. The lock/release mechanism was located beneath the front sight. It fires from an open bolt and by removing the bolt weight, the shooter could change the cyclic rate from 450 to 750 rpm. The magazine fed in from the left hand side like the British Sten. The manual safety was located in front of the trigger on the left side of the weapon. The ZK-383 had two firing modes, semi- and full-auto. Selection was made via the use of a short or long trigger pull. The stock was made from wood and had a folding bipod. The guns featured a hooded front sight and a rear adjustable tangent iron sight.

==Variants==

*ZK-383; Standard production model
*ZK-383-P; Police version, lacking a folding bipod and detachable barrel
*ZK-383-H; Post-war production version which also lacked a bipod and detachable barrel; instead of a left side magazine, this model had a forward-facing underslung magazine

<text>André Lamar Phillips (born September 5, 1959) is a retired American track and field athlete who is best known for winning the 400 metres hurdles gold medal at the 1988 Olympic Games.

Phillips spent most of his career in the shadow of his idol, Edwin Moses, frequently as runner up during Moses&#x27; unequaled winning streak. He managed to beat him once, at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. In 1983, Phillips finished fifth in the 400 m hurdles at the inaugural World Athletics Championships. In 1985, in absence of Moses, Phillips won his only US National Championship title, and also won the IAAF World Cup. In 1988, Phillips lost to Moses at the Olympic trials, but showed a good pace at Olympics, winning his heat and semifinal. In the final, Phillips ran his personal best 47.19 to win a gold medal, beating second-place Amadou Dia Ba from Senegal by 0.04 seconds. At the time he was the second fastest individual over the hurdles. The two times currently still rank them as the #10 and #11 performers of all time. Although Moses ran his fastest Olympic final, he finished only third in a time of 47.56. It was the final race of Moses&#x27; career.

In 2009, Phillips was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

Phillips attended at University of California, Los Angeles, and won the 400 m hurdles at the NCAA championships in 1981. Prior to that, he attended Silver Creek High School in San Jose, California, where he won the CIF California State Meet in the 330-yard low hurdles in 1977. in 36.43. He continues to hold the 330-yard low hurdle record at Silver Creek at 37.1 sec. He joins 1976 4x100 meter relay Gold medalist, and individual 200 meters Silver medalist Millard Hampton, in one of the rare instances (the school claims only eight exist) of two unrelated Olympic Gold Medalists coming from the same high school. Silver Creek continues to host the &quot;Hampton Phillips Classic&quot; named in their honor.

Phillips is a former teacher at Stagg High School, a former Assistant Principal at Franklin High School, and is now the current Principal at Stagg High School in Stockton, California. Phillips earned his educational doctorate (Ed.D.) at Concordia University Irvine.

<doc id="978689" wikidata="Q913762" url="?curid=978689" title="Moor macaque">
<text>The Moor macaque (Macaca maura) is a macaque monkey with brown/black body fur with a pale rump patch and pink bare skin on the rump. It has ischial callosities, which are oval-shaped. It is about 50–58.5 cm long, and eats figs, bamboo seeds, buds, sprouts, invertebrates and cereals in tropical rainforests. It is sometimes called &quot;dog-ape&quot; because of its dog-like muzzle, although it is no more closely related to apes than any other Old World monkey is. It is endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, which is an important biodiversity hotspot.

The Moor macaque is threatened mostly due to habitat loss from an expanding human population and deforestation to increase agricultural land area. The &quot;Macaca maura&quot; population is estimated to have decreased from 56,000 in 1983 to under 10,000 in 1994. In 1992, conducted an extensive survey and found 6.3–63.2 individuals/km2. They usually live in groups of 15-40 individuals, with female philopatry and male dispersal and they are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They spend a lot of their time in trees foraging and on the ground travelling.

According to the Behavioural Data collection done on 2 groups of Moor macaques in the Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park in South Sulawesi, this species spends most of their time feeding in places where food resources are abundant. The results also show that Moor macaques tend to spend more time foraging as the group size increases as they spend less time in alertness.

The population of this species is highly endangered due to serious anthropogenic activities like agriculture and tourism, which contribute to its habitat loss. Like many other frugivorous primates, Moor macaques  have made significant contributions to the environment, helping to support high densities of seedlings and saplings as well as the process of gene flow among plant populations. This is crucial for sustaining forest regeneration and restoring vegetation in degraded forests.

This species has been on the IUCN Red list of threatened species (A2cd) since 2015.

== Taxonomy ==
The Moor macaque made its first appearance in western science through the work of Heinrich Rudolf Schinz in 1825.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Indonesian island of Sulawesi hosts 7 species of macaques with one of them being the Moor macaque. Unfortunately, the Moor macaque is endemic to the island and is considered to be endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Moor macaque is the only species of macaques that existed naturally in South Sulawesi. Moor macaques have significant ecological flexibility that enables them to use several forest strata, including secondary habitats. They have a different ecological environment compared to other nonhuman primates since they have no major predators or competitors except where their ranges overlap. The home range of the Moor macaque group is usually 20-30 ha wide, with a total distance of roughly 6.64 km.

They can be found in lowland forests, grasslands, limestone areas and even near human habitations, and they are commonly found with the endemic Malkoha birds that feed on grasshoppers, which are pushed out of the canopy by the macaques&#x27; movements.

Those living near humans have been observed to be more present in areas where domestic animals are found, as these areas do not have a lot of traps that endanger them. They are predominantly found in the karst forest ecosystem of South Sulawesi. The karst plain forest is more resourceful for these macaques as the latter contains an abundance of food. Researchers discovered that out of the 107 identified tree species, 74 of them were vital macaque food species with the remaining being food species of secondary importance. The latter information was put together due to a study that took place in the Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park and specifically in the Karaenta area, a former nature reserve, where high density of fig trees as well as the fact that the Karaenta forest is separated from bigger forest tracts have led to a high population density of Moor macaques. As a result, Moor macaques have limited home ranges at this location.

The karst tower forest is less useful for the macaques in terms of acquiring food or other related resources but acts as a natural refuge from human disturbance. Another important area with significant Moor macaques is the Tabo-tabo forest in Pangkep and is considered to be a secondary forest area. The home range for primates is characterised by three factors; food availability, the distribution of the food, and the interval of changing fruit seasons.The Tabo-tabo forest is characterised as a secondary lowland forest and the latter created a suitable environment for the growth of plants on fertile alluvial and Mediterranean red soils.The high diversity of plants and shelter provision in the area made the land extremely suitable for these macaques to thrive.

== Behavior ==
The most common behavioural activities of Moor macaques are feeding, followed by moving, resting, and social interaction. 

Moor macaques are a male dispersing species. Males leave the groups in which they are born between the ages of 7 and 9, while females stay in their birth groups. This has an important purpose, it avoids inbreeding and broadens the genetic pool of the groups. Moor macaques groups have been observed to be tolerant and not very aggressive. Group fission occurs in Moor macaques, competition between females for food does not seem to be the reason for fission. However, some studies relate group fission to competition among females for food resources, others attribute it to increased sexual competition among males, and some others relate this phenomenon to establishing home ranges, specifically in Moor macaque groups with overlapped home ranges.

The Sulawesi macaques, including Moor macaques, are further distinguishable from other macaques by their quiet bared-teeth display and the uttering of a loud call. Rather than conveying submission, as in most macaque species, the quiet bared-teeth display is thought to express the emitter&#x27;s peaceful intentions, promoting positive interactions. All Sulawesi macaques, particularly adult males have emit a loud call, a particular, bird-like vocalization.

During agonistic encounters, wild Moor macaques have low inter-individual distances, uncommon strong aggression, a strong conciliatory tendency, and limited support for kin. 

Predation is a key evolutionary factor. Snakes are one of the most prevalent primate predators, and the primates’ quick detection of predators may have contributed to the evolution of their visual and perceptual skills. When primates notice a snake, they frequently respond by making alarm calls that attract and/or notify other members of the group about its presence, and/or by mobbing it.

=== Sexual behavior ===
Perineal swelling is an important factor in the sexual life of Moor macaques. As this species does not have a marked reproductive season, not all females swell at the same time. Females start to swell between the age of 4 years and 6 years and have their first child between the age of 6 years and 7 years. Swelling individuals are more likely mounted by the males than non-swelling ones. The dominant and oldest female of the group is usually mounted by the alpha male. Non-alpha males only mount females when the alpha is out of sight and lower ranking males usually mount non-swelling females, although in most Moor macaque groups, there is only one male. Poor dietary factors appear to be associated with a delay in the onset of perineal swelling and first parturition. 

From the end of the rainy season to the start of the dry season, there appeared to be a rise in births. The moor macaques are classified as moderately seasonal breeders based on the fact that 33-67% of their newborns occur in a single three-month period. The peak might be explained by yearly increases in food supply, particularly a rise in fruit.

Female reproductive state differences within a group may have an effect on female furcation patterns, which may be more noticeable in egalitarian species where social interactions are less impacted by dominance or kinship. This furcation pattern may be caused by the tendency of adult females that are not cycling to stay near to one another.

=== Social behavior ===

Changes in group fission process and furcation patterns may reflect differences in social characteristics among species as well as ecological and demographic differences among populations; thus, studies of group fission may contribute to our general understanding of why primates live in a variety of groupings.

Special relationships between certain males and females can either trigger or encourage group fission. In Moor macaques, however, significant connection between specific males and females does not appear to affect the process of fission. Moor macaque females are not actively involved in intergroup interactions. On the other hand, male aggression toward other groups is significantly more frequent than female aggression. Adult female furcation patterns can be anticipated by their connection with one another, such as grooming behavior, prior to group fission. However, the grooming habit of mature female Moor macaques was unrelated to the furcation. Individuals of similar age, sex, or rank tend to stay close to one another.

Moor macaques are an ideal taxon to examine interspecific diversity in play behavior among nonhuman primates. Play is an excessive, spontaneous, and self-rewarding behavior that serves no immediate purpose and frequently takes place in non-stressful circumstances. Moor macaques spend a larger proportion of their time in solitary and social play than in grooming interactions. Play sessions in Moor macaques include more individuals, large variety of play behaviors, great play face rates, great proportion of time in contact play, and high rate of reciprocal play‐biting. Aggressive escalations were not common in Moor macaques.
=== Diet ===
Despite their frequently changing habitats, Moor macaques are characterized by having a flexible diet. Insects and other food items, including shoots and young leaves, are essential resources for Moor macaques, particularly in extensively altered habitats. The tree species known to be a diet are Garcinia nervosa, Arenga pinnata, Flacourtia rukam, Ficus. sp, Eugenia cuminii, Gastonia serratifolia, Mangifera sp., Spondias dulcis, and Muntingia calabura.

Compared to other macaques, kinship in Moor macaques may have less of an influence on proximity during feeding. Weak kinship effects during feeding may be caused by a lack of food competition within the group. When within-group competition (WGC) for food resources is intense, lower-ranking females are likely to move away from original groupings and create new smaller groups.

=== Maternity ===
Moor macaques usually stay close to their matrilineal relatives more when they are moving or resting than when they are feeding.

Females are in close proximity to females with newborn infants, regardless of the group&#x27;s stage of activity.

== Interaction with humans ==
Anthropogenic factors such as habitat fragmentation, alterations, along with non-species-specific hunting traps in the forest have become major risks to the Moor macaques&#x27; survival, with more than half of the population declining over three decades.

Due to anthropogenic activities, Moor Macaque interactions with humans have increased. Primates are often victims of such occurrences because they have a hard time adapting to environmental disturbances. Due to their endemic status to the island of Sulawesi, most of their interactions used to be with the Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park staff and researchers who would feed them, which is considered as consistent provisioning. Starting the year 2015, they started interacting with vehicles that would drive along a road located in their home range, which is considered as inconsistent provisioning. Based on the available research, human interaction damages the social networks of these macaques, and the latter is necessary for increase of infant survival, social ranking, reproductive success, and even enhanced thermoregulation during winter.

According to a study about the habituation process, Moor macaques react differently to the presence of humans depending on their previous interactions with them. Moor macaques are better approached in areas of greater visibility with more trees. Food provisioning, in which people purposefully offer food to nonhuman primates, may result in rapid habituation of wildlife such that they approach humans for food, take food from their hands, and perhaps aggress toward them to elicit provisioning behavior. Provisioning can lead to reduced foraging energy consumption in monkeys, more time for resting and social behavior, and higher birth rates, provisioned foods can be good energy sources. However, because it is linked to a higher risk of injury, zoonotic disease transmission, and direct human interaction, provisioning may also be potentially dangerous for monkeys and other wildlife species.

Studies have found that the relatively widespread habit of pet macaque ownership among a variety of ethnic and religious groups on the island explain the bidirectional disease transmission. The majority of Sulawesi macaques kept as pets are captured as infants by opportunistically trapping wild mother-infant pairs or by using traps to reduce crop raiding, which resulted in competition for resources. Moor macaques’ encounter rate is lower in areas with more open spaces and with no trees than in areas with greater forest cover. Moreover, the individual encounter rate is lower when more traps are found in an area and higher when more domestic animals are sighted in the area.

== Conservation ==
The tourism industry, hunting, agriculture and logging are some of the big threats to the Moor macaques because they highly contribute to their habitat loss. This resulted in the change and loss of 80% of Sulawesi&#x27;s forests, with just 30% remaining in good condition - which means forest canopy unbroken by large clearings and only scattered signs of human activity. Therefore, Moor macaques’ conservation has become a broader concern.

Even in areas that are under local protection, deforestation is still observed in many forests of the southern parts of the Sulawesi Island, thus conservation of the population of Moor macaques should be a priority since its population is declining at a high rate. For conservation purposes, information on life histories and demography is essential. The conservation status of Moor macaques is considered high. However, due to significant habitat degradation, the condition of Moor macaques does not warrant optimism. It has been recommended that new reserves be established as well as expanding the existing reserves. Based on a study, challenges for species and their conservation efforts occurred as a result of the shrinking of forest areas and the deterioration of forest quality as habitat. Additionally, growing human populations have had a substantial negative influence on both populations and habitats of Moor macaques.

According to a study done on the effects of anthropogenic activities on the population of Moor macaques, the population density of Moor macaques is low outside of protected areas and support the study&#x27;s hypothesis that the population of this species is declining in several regions, especially in the southern forests of the species’ geographic range. Furthermore, they found a high presence of anthropogenic activity in forests inhabited by Moor macaques, and a negative effect of the number of non species-specific hunting traps in the forest on macaque encounter rate. In the National Park of Chamba District, South Sulawesi, there was an observed decrease in Moor macaques due to human settlement and road traffics which endanger the life of Moor macaques through food poisoning, and road accidents.

During a survey in South Sulawesi, there was a high encounter of Moor macaques in agroforests, where it was seen that Moor macaques like feeding on corn. This is a sign that different types of plantations can influence the distribution and encounter rate of Moor macaques. This, with different interviews with local people inhabiting the area surveyed, combining a well conserved forest with small agricultural patches on landscape scape can have a positive effect on the conservation of Moor macaques. With other studies done on the effect of agroforests on the conservation of Moor macaques, it has been observed that agroforests and forests cover can positively affect or increase the population of Moor macaques. Therefore, for better conservation and for the benefit of remnant subpopulations, forests in South Sulawesi Island should be protected and conserved. Raising awareness of the ecological importance of Moor macaques, and motivating people to conduct activities that are ecologically sustainable are also good actions towards the conservation of Moor macaques. While there are some studies done in South Sulawesi, more studies have to be conducted on other parts of the Island for an adequate conservation of this species.

<doc id="978698" wikidata="Q36529" url="?curid=978698" title="Karaj">
<text>Karaj (; ) is a city in the Central District of Karaj County, Alborz province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. Earliest evidence of inhabitation in Karaj can be dated to the Bronze Age at Tepe Khurvin. The city was developed under the rule of the Safavid and Qajar Empire and is home to historical buildings and memorials from those eras. This city has a unique climate due to access to natural resources such as many trees, rivers, and green plains. After Tehran, Karaj is the largest immigrant-friendly city in Iran, so it has been nicknamed &quot;Little Iran.&quot;

Although the county hosts a population around 1.97 million, as recorded in the 2016 census, most of the county is rugged mountain. The urban area is the fourth-largest in Iran, after Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan. Eshtehard County and Fardis County were split off from Karaj County since the previous census.

== History ==
The area around Karaj has been inhabited for thousands of years, as shown by the Bronze Age site of Tepe Khurvin and the Iron Age site of Kalak. However, the present-day city of Karaj is mostly the result of modern industrial development in the 20th century.

Karaj was mostly significant as a stage on the road between Tehran and Qazvin. In Safavid times, a stone bridge was built that served as the main crossing into the town. The large Shah-Abbasi Caravansarai, located at the southeast of Towhid Square, was built in the same era, under the rule of Šāh Esmāil.

In 1810, the Qajar prince Soleyman Mirza built the Soleymaniyeh Palace at Karaj to serve as a summer resort. The palace had four towers and was surrounded by gardens, and its reception room featured a pair of paintings by Abdallah Khan Naqqashbandi. By 1860, however, the palace was described as abandoned and only used as a shelter for travelers. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar later renovated the palace. In 1917, a School of Farming was established on the site, replacing the earlier Mozaffari Agricultural School in Tehran. Later, Reza Pahlavi granted it to the University of Tehran&#x27;s new Faculty of Agriculture.

In the 1930s, plans were drawn up for a large industrial complex covering 216 hectares on the south side of the village. This &quot;Industrial Model Town of Karaj&quot; was intended to be the site of the country&#x27;s first steel mills, capitalizing on easy access to water and coal from the Alborz. However, the construction equipment imported from Germany was impounded by the British going through the Suez Canal in 1940, and the planned complex was never built.

A major industrial complex, the first privately-owned one in Karaj, was built in the 1960s by Mohammad-Sadeq Fateh. This complex, called Shahrak-e Jahanshahr, included oil, tea, and textile factories as well as housing for the workers.
The Morvārid Palace was constructed in nearby Mehršahr district, during the Pahlavi era. It was designed by the &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation&quot; (Taliesin Associated Architects) on instructions from Shams Pahlavi, elder sister of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In this period it was a transit and industrial town.

Majority of the structure is now controlled by the Basij Organization, and some sections of it are open to public under the operation of Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran.

Other historical sites of the city include the Mausoleum of Šāhzāde Soleymān, Emāmzāde Rahmān, Emāmzāde Zeyd, and Palang Ābād e Eštehārd.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity===
The majority of the residents of Karaj are Persians, with Azerbaijanis making up the second major ethno-linguistic group of the city. Kurds, Gilak, Tabari and Lurs include the other ethnicities among the population of Karaj.


===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 1,377,450 in 385,955 households, when it was in Tehran province. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 1,592,492 people in 508,420 households, by which time the county had been separated from the province in the establishment of Alborz province.

<doc id="978712" wikidata="Q3191490" url="?curid=978712" title="KRCR-TV">
<text>KRCR-TV (channel 7) is a television station licensed to Redding, California, United States, serving as the ABC affiliate for the Chico–Redding market. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside five low-power stations: Chico-licensed Antenna TV affiliate KXVU-LD (channel 17); MyNetworkTV affiliates Redding-licensed KRVU-LD (channel 21) and Chico-licensed KZVU-LD (channel 22); Chico-licensed Univision affiliate KUCO-LD (channel 27); and Chico-licensed UniMás affiliate KKTF-LD (channel 30). Sinclair also provides certain services to Paradise-licensed Fox affiliate KCVU (channel 20) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cunningham Broadcasting; however, Sinclair effectively owns KCVU as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The stations share studios on Auditorium Drive east of downtown Redding and maintain a news bureau and sales office at the former Sainte Television Group facilities on Main Street in downtown Chico (for FCC and other legal purposes, the Chico/Paradise-licensed stations still use the Chico address and Redding-licensed stations use the Redding address). KRCR&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Shasta Bally, west of Redding.

[[KAEF-TV]] (channel 23) in Arcata operates as a semi-satellite of KRCR, serving the Eureka market. As such, it clears all network programming as provided through KRCR but airs a separate offering of syndicated programming; there are also separate local newscasts, commercial inserts and legal station identifications. Although KAEF maintains its own studios (shared with LMA partner KBVU) on Sixth Street in downtown Eureka, master control and some internal operations are based at KRCR&#x27;s facilities.

==History==
The station was founded in 1956 as KVIP (adding the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix to its callsign on August 15, 1957) by William B. Smullin of California Oregon Broadcasting, Inc. (COBI), owners of KOBI in Medford, Oregon, and satellite station KOTI in Klamath Falls, as a primary NBC affiliate with a secondary ABC affiliation. By 1963, network emphasis had shifted towards ABC, as only the Saturday morning and Sunday night prime time schedules, a few daytime game shows and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; were carried in NBC&#x27;s schedule pattern. The full ABC schedule was available by way of translators of Stockton&#x27;s KOVR in Chico and Redding. Channel 7 became KRCR in 1963.

It dropped NBC and took on a full-time ABC affiliation in 1978, which in turn started the seven-year process for building KCPM (channel 24, now KNVN). This was an unusual arrangement for a two-station market especially one of the size of Chico–Redding, but after 15 years of unsuccessful attempts the area was served by a local ABC affiliate.
Under COBI ownership, KRCR used a logo consisting of an Interstate shield sign like its sister stations, placing &quot;7R&quot; where the number would be. 7R was adapted as branding for the station at that time, as the Northern California &quot;TV Guide&quot; edition identified it with a &quot;7R&quot; &#x27;channel bullet&#x27; to differentiate it from ABC owned-and-operated station KGO-TV in San Francisco and its similar network schedule.

KRCR, KAEF, and KFWU in Fort Bragg (now KQSL in Cloverdale, part of the San Francisco TV market), aired Fox full-time on off-network hours from the network&#x27;s launch in 1986 until 1994 when now-sister station KCVU switched to Fox and KBVU signed on.

KRCR was purchased by Lamco Communications of Texas in 1995 and was rebranded &quot;News Channel 7&quot;, which remains the branding for the newscasts. The station was operated by California Broadcasting, Inc., and run by general manager Bob Wise (now of KOBI) until 2004 when the station was sold to Bluestone Television. In December 2006, the station was sold (along with 12 other Bluestone stations) to Diamond Castle Holdings, a New York-based private equity firm, which later became Bonten Media Group.

The station also operates a semi-satellite in Eureka, KAEF-TV (channel 23). It operated a local cable-only WB affiliate KIWB, but that station was sold to Catamount Broadcasting following the merger between the WB and UPN to form the new CW Network. KRVU-LD was previously a UPN affiliate but is now a MyNetworkTV affiliate.

KRCR was one of a select few ABC affiliates that broadcast on channel 7, but chose not to license the network&#x27;s Circle 7 logo, until April 11, 2006, when the station rebranded and introduced its new set, along with the digital age allowing clear differentiation of both KRCR and KGO&#x27;s signals via virtual channel data if a viewer was in position to receive both stations.

===Merger with KCVU and KBVU===
In December 2012, KRCR/KAEF took over sales operations of KCVU in Chico, as well as KVIQ and KBVU in Eureka. They still maintain separate operations.

In August 2012, Bonten Media announced that KCVU and KBVU would be sold to Esteem Broadcasting, effectively merging both the ABC and Fox affiliates&#x27; operations to create a media powerhouse north of Sacramento and south of the Oregon border.

On April 21, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent to purchase the Bonten stations (including KRCR) for $240 million. Sinclair&#x27;s sidecar Cunningham Broadcasting acquired the Esteem stations (including KCVU). The sale was completed September 1.


==Notable former on-air staff==
* Rich Eisen – sports anchor/reporter (now of NFL Network and &quot;The Rich Eisen Show&quot;, formerly of ESPN)
* Mark Eubank – meteorologist
* Sandra Maas – news anchor/reporter (formerly of KSBY-TV and KFMB-TV, now at KUSI-TV)
* Craig Padilla – chief creative services editor and production manager (now full-time self-employed professional musician &amp; video editor)
* Kristen Welker – NBC White House correspondent and host of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;

==&quot;What Makes News Channel 7?&quot;==
In the fall of 1995, Continental Cablevision of Mt. Shasta (now part of Vyve Broadband) filmed, produced and broadcast a 30-minute documentary special called &quot;What Makes News Channel 7?&quot; as part of its newsmagazine series &quot;In Focus: Siskiyou Magazine&quot;. It took a look behind the scenes at what went on at the station and focused mainly on the news team featuring a behind-the-scenes look at how a newscast is produced as well as interviews with key personalities such as Mike Mangas, Rich Eisen, Sandra Geist, Warren Wright, Gary Gunter and Katy Brown. The program aired on Mt. Shasta cable channel 3 in the winter and spring of 1996 and starting showing on YouTube and MySpace in February 2010. It was rebroadcast over Mt. Shasta cable airwaves again on MCTV 15 in 2010 leading to that program&#x27;s relaunch.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:

On August 23, 2011, Disney-ABC Television Group announced that KRCR would carry Live Well Network as part of an affiliation agreement with Bonten Media Group; the network was added to a new third subchannel. Live Well Network was replaced by Movies! on November 18, 2013, only for it to be replaced by Comet on September 1, 2022.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KRCR-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date when full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from UHF channel 34 to VHF channel 7. The station&#x27;s pre-transition channel position on channel 34 was later converted to a translator.

===Translators===
* Benbow, etc.
* Burney, etc.
* Oroville
* Paradise
* Redding
* Weaverville

====Former translators====
In the early 1990s, KRCR operated a satellite, KFWU (channel 8), in Fort Bragg; originally serving as an ABC affiliate for the Mendocino County portion of the San Francisco Bay Area television market; the station would be sold in 1996. It is currently independent station KQSL.

KRCR was formerly broadcast on translators channel 2 in Lakehead; channel 3 in Lewiston and Mountain Gate; channel 4 in Big Bend, etc., Hayfork and Covelo; channel 5 in Mineral and Trinity Center; channel 20 in Yuba City, part of the Sacramento television market (KRCR no longer broadcasts at all in Yuba City) and channel 21 in Susanville, part of the Reno market.

==Carriage disputes==
===Mt. Shasta cable dispute===
Since its inception in the mid-1980s, the Mt. Shasta cable system owned by Northland Communications (now Vyve Broadband) had carried KRCR on its cable channel 7. However, in January 2012, Northland dropped KRCR from its cable lineup after the station&#x27;s current ownership and the cable company failed to come to a mutual agreement to continue the station&#x27;s coverage on the system and severed ties after a near-30-year working relationship between the two. As a result, Northland replaced KRCR on cable channel 7 with Medford, Oregon&#x27;s ABC affiliate, KDRV (channel 12).

Despite being in California, Siskiyou County is part of the Medford market according to the FCC. Both KRCR and Northland made several attempts to get the DMA changed but were unsuccessful each time. KHSL-TV, KNVN-TV and KIXE-TV were the &quot;only&quot; Chico–Redding market stations airing on the Northland system in Mt. Shasta; however, certain programs on KHSL and KNVN are subject to blackout due to the FCC&#x27;s network non-duplication and syndication exclusivity rules.

In 2021, KRCR returned to the Vyve Broadband cable line-up on channel 12 (replacing KHSL-TV) and its sister station KRVU returned to cable channel 2. (KIXE-TV remains on channel 9.)

===Disputes with Dish Network===
Under its former Bonten ownership, the company and Dish Network had two retransmission consent issues that led to Bonten stations (including KRCR) to be removed from the provider. As a result, on December 8, 2013, Dish stopped carrying KRCR on their system before a later restoration. On January 17, 2017, KRCR and KCVU were once again removed from Dish&#x27;s lineup as part of a new dispute, returning on February 13.

<doc id="978717" wikidata="Q507546" url="?curid=978717" title="Orbital node">
<text>An orbital node is either of the two points where an orbit intersects a plane of reference to which it is inclined. A non-inclined orbit, which is contained in the reference plane, has no nodes.

==Planes of reference==
Common planes of reference include the following:
* For a geocentric orbit, Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane. In this case, non-inclined orbits are called &quot;equatorial&quot;.
* For a heliocentric orbit, the ecliptic or invariable plane. In this case, non-inclined orbits are called &quot;ecliptic&quot;.
* For an orbit outside the Solar System, the plane through the primary perpendicular to a line through the observer and the primary (called the &quot;plane of the sky&quot;).

== Node distinction ==
If a reference direction from one side of the plane of reference to the other is defined, the two nodes can be distinguished. For geocentric and heliocentric orbits, the ascending node (or north node) is where the orbiting object moves north through the plane of reference, and the descending node (or south node) is where it moves south through the plane. In the case of objects outside the Solar System, the ascending node is the node where the orbiting secondary passes away from the observer, and the descending node is the node where it moves towards the observer., p. 137.

The position of the node may be used as one of a set of parameters, called &quot;orbital elements&quot;, which describe the orbit. This is done by specifying the longitude of the ascending node (or, sometimes, the longitude of the node.)

The line of nodes is the straight line resulting from the intersection of the object&#x27;s orbital plane with the plane of reference; it passes through the two nodes.

== Symbols and nomenclature ==

The symbol of the ascending node is (Unicode: U+260A, ☊), and the symbol of the descending node is (Unicode: U+260B, ☋).

In medieval and early modern times, the ascending and descending nodes of the Moon in the ecliptic plane were called the &quot;dragon&#x27;s head&quot; (, ) and &quot;dragon&#x27;s tail&quot; (), respectively. These terms originally referred to the times when the Moon crossed the apparent path of the sun in the sky (as in a solar eclipse). Also, corruptions of the Arabic term such as &quot;ganzaar&quot;, &quot;genzahar&quot;, &quot;geuzaar&quot; and &quot;zeuzahar&quot; were used in the medieval West to denote either of the nodes.

The Koine Greek terms and were also used for the ascending and descending nodes, giving rise to the English terms &quot;anabibazon&quot; and &quot;catabibazon&quot;.

==Lunar nodes==
For the orbit of the Moon around Earth, the plane is taken to be the ecliptic, not the equatorial plane. The gravitational pull of the Sun upon the Moon causes its nodes to gradually precess westward, completing a cycle in approximately 18.6 years.

===Use in astrology===

The image of the ascending and descending orbital nodes as the head and tail of a dragon, 180 degrees apart in the sky, goes back to the Chaldeans; it was used by the Zoroastrians, and then by Arabic astronomers and astrologers. In Middle Persian, its head and tail were respectively called and ; in Arabic, and — or in the case of the Moon, ___ . Among the arguments against astrologers made by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), in his &quot;Miftah Dar al-SaCadah:&quot; &quot;Why is it that you have given an influence to [the head] and [the tail], which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?&quot;

<doc id="978718" wikidata="Q2314278" url="?curid=978718" title="Oostduinkerke">
<text>Oostduinkerke (; ; ) is a place on the southern west coast of Belgium, located in the province of West Flanders. Once a municipality of its own, Oostduinkerke now is a sub-municipality in the municipality of Koksijde.

The name &quot;Oostduinkerke&quot; translates as &#x27;East Dunkirk&#x27;. The town originally shared its name with the city of Dunkirk in current-day France; therefore, in the 13th century, &quot;Oost-&quot; was added to its name to avoid confusion with its namesake further to the west.

Oostduinkerke lies amidst a dune area (approximately 2.4 km2; 1 sq. mi.), which is now a protected nature reserve. Oostduinkerke&#x27;s sandy beach stretches from 250 to 700 metres (270 to 800 yards) at ebb-tide and extends over 30 km (20 miles), via De Panne to the beach of Dunkirk (France), which explains why Oostduinkerke is popular with sand yachters and parakarters.

==Shrimp fishing on horseback==
 
Oostduinkerke is known for its shrimpers on horseback, a considerable tourist attraction. The practice was once common across the coastal areas of the North Sea, but today it is only present in Oostduinkerke, where 17 fishers remain active as of 2021.

==Sights==
Oostduinkerke has several museums. The National Fishery Museum gives a historical survey of Flemish fishery and shows among other things scale models of fishing boats from 800 AD up to the present, and an original fisherman&#x27;s cottage. Other museums are: &#x27;The Key and Lock Museum&#x27; (a unique historical survey of 3,000 years of keys and locks), a regional museum &#x27;t Krekelhof (The cricket court in Dutch) (a huge collection of craft objects and curiosities from the 19th century), and Florishof (old crafts and folkloristic objects).

Oostduinkerke is also home to Koksijde Golf ter Hille, a par-72 golf course.

The British Military Cemetery (1940–1945) bears witness to British sacrifices in the Battle of Dunkirk.

<doc id="978720" wikidata="Q417824" url="?curid=978720" title="Gefitinib">
<text>Gefitinib, sold under the brand name Iressa, is a medication used for certain breast, lung and other cancers. Gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor, like erlotinib, which interrupts signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in target cells. Therefore, it is only effective in cancers with mutated and overactive EGFR, but resistances to gefitinib can arise through other mutations. It is marketed by AstraZeneca and Teva.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

== Mechanism of action ==
Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor&#x27;s (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain. Thus gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor. The target protein (EGFR) is a member of a family of receptors (ErbB) which includes Her1(EGFR), Her2(erb-B2), Her3(erb-B3) and Her4 (Erb-B4).
EGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of human carcinomas - for example in lung and breast cancers. This leads to inappropriate activation of the anti-apoptotic Ras signalling cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Research on gefitinib-sensitive non-small cell lung cancers has shown that a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is responsible for activating anti-apoptotic pathways. These mutations tend to confer increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Of the types of non-small cell lung cancer histologies, adenocarcinoma is the type that most often harbors these mutations. These mutations are more commonly seen in Asians, women, and non-smokers (who also tend to more often have adenocarcinoma).

Gefitinib inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. Thus the function of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in activating the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade is inhibited, and malignant cells are inhibited.

==Clinical uses==
Gefitinib is marketed in many countries.

Iressa was approved and marketed in July 2002, in Japan, making it the first country to import the drug.

The FDA approved gefitinib in May 2003, for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was approved as monotherapy for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies.

In June 2005, the FDA withdrew approval for use in new patients due to lack of evidence that it extended life.

In the European Union, gefitinib is indicated since 2009 in advanced NSCLC in all lines of treatment for patients harbouring EGFR mutations. This label was granted after gefitinib demonstrated as a first-line treatment to significantly improve progression-free survival vs. a platinum doublet regime in patients harbouring such mutations. IPASS has been the first of four phase III trials to have confirmed gefitinib superiority in this patient population.

In most of the other countries where gefitinib is marketed it is approved for people with advanced NSCLC who had received at least one previous chemotherapy regime. However, applications to expand its label as a first-line treatment in patients harbouring EGFR mutations is currently in process based on the latest scientific evidence. As at August 2012 New Zealand has approved gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation for naive locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable NSCLC. This is publicly funded for an initial four-month term and renewal if no progression.

In July 2015, the FDA approved gefitinib as a first-line treatment for NSCLC.

==Experimental uses==

In August 2013, the BBC reported that researchers in Edinburgh and Melbourne found, in a small-scale trial of 12 patients, that the effectiveness of Methotrexate for treating ectopic pregnancy was improved when Gefitinib was also administered.

==Studies==
IPASS (IRESSA Pan-Asia Study) was a randomized, large-scale, double-blinded study which compared gefitinib vs. carboplatin/ paclitaxel as a first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC.
IPASS studied 1,217 patients with confirmed adenocarcinoma histology who were former or never smokers. A pre-planned sub-group analyses showed that progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for gefitinib than chemotherapy in patients with &quot;EGFR&quot; mutation positive tumours (HR 0.48, 95 per cent CI 0.36 to 0.64, p less than 0.0001), and significantly longer for chemotherapy than gefitinib in patients with &quot;EGFR&quot; mutation negative tumours (HR 2.85, 95 per cent CI 2.05 to 3.98, p less than 0.0001).
This, in 2009, was the first time a targeted monotherapy has demonstrated significantly longer PFS than doublet chemotherapy.

===EGFR diagnostic tests===
Roche Diagnostics, Genzyme, QIAGEN, Argenomics S.A. &amp; other companies make tests to detect &quot;EGFR&quot; mutations, designed to help predict which lung cancer patients may respond best to some therapies, including gefitinib and erlotinib.

The tests examine the genetics of tumors removed for biopsy for mutations that make them susceptible to treatment.

The &quot;EGFR&quot; mutation test may also help AstraZeneca win regulatory approval for use of their drugs as initial therapies. Currently the TK inhibitors are approved for use only after other drugs fail. In the case of gefitinib, the drug works only in about 10% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer.

==Adverse effects==
As gefitinib is a selective chemotherapeutic agent, its tolerability profile is better than previous cytotoxic agents. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are acceptable for a potentially fatal disease.

Acne-like rash is reported very commonly. Other common adverse effects (≥1% of patients) include: diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, dehydration, skin reactions, paronychia, asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes, asthenia, conjunctivitis, blepharitis.

Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: interstitial lung disease, corneal erosion, aberrant eyelash and hair growth.

== Resistance ==
Gefitinib and other first-generation EGFR inhibitors reversibly bind to the receptor protein, effectively competing for the ATP binding pocket. Secondary mutations can arise that alter the binding site, the most common mutation being T790M, where a threonine is replaced by a methionine at amino acid position 790, which is in the ligand-binding domain that typically binds ATP. Threonine 790 is the gatekeeper residue, meaning it is key in determining specificity in the binding pocket. When it is mutated into a methionine, researchers originally hypothesized that it caused drug inhibition due to the steric hindrance of the bulkier methionine that selected for the binding of ATP instead of gefitinib. As of 2008, the current hypothesized mechanism is that resistance to gefitinib is conveyed by increasing the ATP affinity of EGFR on an enzymatic level, meaning that the protein preferentially binds ATP over gefitinib.

In order to combat this acquired resistance to gefitinib and other first-generation inhibitors, researchers have used irreversible EGFR inhibitors like neratinib or dacomitinib, called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These new drugs covalently bind to the ATP binding pocket, so when they are attached to EGFR, they cannot be displaced by ATP. Even if the mutated versions of EGFR have a higher affinity for ATP, they will eventually use the irreversible inhibitors as ligands, which effectively shuts down their activity. When enough irreversible ligands have bound to EGFR, proliferation will be halted and apoptosis will be triggered through multiple pathways; for example, Bim can be activated after it is no longer inhibited by ERK, one of the kinases in the EGFR signaling pathway. Even with gefitinib halting progression of NSCLC, the development of the cancer progresses after 9 to 13 months due to acquired resistances like the T790M mutation. These TKIs like dacomitinib extended overall survival by close to a year.

<text>Lava Hay were a Canadian folk rock duo formed in 1989 in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of Suzanne Little and Michele Gould. Little and Gould first met in 1986, while working at &quot;Now&quot;. In 1989 they recorded an album together with the intention of distributing it independently, but it soon came to the attention of Nettwerk.

The duo signed to Nettwerk and remixed the album, bringing in members of The Grapes of Wrath, Bob Wiseman and The Water Walk for guest appearances. That album was released as &quot;Lava Hay&quot; in 1990. The duo&#x27;s collaborations with The Grapes of Wrath soon took on an added component: Gould began dating Vincent Jones and Little began dating Tom Hooper, and both couples later married. Because of their close professional and personal relationships with the Grapes, the band sometimes struggled against a perception in the music press that they were merely puppets of their husbands&#x27; band rather than real musicians.

Lava Hay&#x27;s second and final album, &quot;With a Picture in Mind&quot;, was released in 1992. That album&#x27;s single &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the &quot;RPM&quot; singles, with a peak position of 64. However, the album was also noted for being less artistically cohesive than the debut; while Little&#x27;s songs retained the folk flavour the band was known for, Gould&#x27;s were rapidly evolving toward a rock style strongly influenced by one of her first musical heroes, Chrissie Hynde.

After Lava Hay broke up in 1994, Gould formed the band Taste of Joy and Little released material as a solo artist.

<text>Adak Island (, ; ) or Father Island is an island near the western extent of the Andreanof Islands group of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Alaska&#x27;s southernmost city, Adak, is located on the island. The island has a land area of , measuring long and wide, making it the 25th largest island in the United States.

Due to harsh winds, frequent cloud cover, and cold temperatures, vegetation is mostly tundra (grasses, mosses, berries, low-lying flowering plants) at lower elevations. The highest point is Mount Moffett, near the northwest end of the island, at an elevation of 3,924 feet (1,196 m). It is snow covered the greater part of the year. Adak is its largest and principal city.

The word &quot;Adak&quot; is from the Aleut word &quot;adaq&quot;, which means &quot;father&quot;.

==History==

Adak Island has been the home to Aleut peoples since antiquity. Russian explorers in the 18th century also visited the island but made no permanent settlements. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army took control of two of the westernmost Aleutian Islands, Attu and Kiska, in the incorporated territory of Alaska, the first foreign enemy to occupy American soil since the War of 1812. The Japanese also attacked the American base at Dutch Harbor by air. The Japanese campaign coincided with the more well-known Battle of Midway. In response, the United States military began a campaign to oust the Japanese. Since the nearest U.S. military presence was in Cold Bay, Alaska, the U.S. began to construct bases in the western Aleutian Islands from which to launch operations against the Japanese. Adak Island was chosen as the site of an airfield, and flight operations began in September 1942. On May 11, 1943, four days after the initial invasion date was delayed by bad weather, American soldiers landed on Attu Island and defeated the Japanese garrison there, at the cost of 2,300 Japanese and 550 American lives. Expecting a similar battle for Kiska Island, U.S. and Allied soldiers landing there August 15, 1943, found the occupiers had been stealthily evacuated by Japanese naval forces since the end of May, 1943. Even so, over 313 Allied soldiers died from friendly fire, mines, and other anti-personnel devices during Allied operations to take back Kiska. In 1953, remains of 236 Japanese dead who had been buried in Adak Cemetery were reburied in Japan&#x27;s Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery.

After the war was over, the approximately 6,000 American military men who served on Adak during World War II recalled Adak&#x27;s cold, foggy, windy weather; mud; Quonset huts; few women and no trees; and a volcano that from time to time would issue puffs of smoke. Fresh food was a rarity.

Adak Naval Air Station continued to be a military base during the Cold War but was designated a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) site in 1995 and closed in March 1997. Shortly thereafter, the town of Adak was incorporated at the site of the former base. Down from a peak population of 6,000, the island recorded a 2010 census population of 326 residents, all in the city of Adak, in the northern part of the island. In 1980, the Aleutian Islands National Wildlife Refuge was created and much of Adak Island lies within its boundaries.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game introduced approximately 23 caribou calves to the island in the late 1950s, in part to help prevent famine emergencies. Adak Island, with its now large caribou herd of approximately 1,000 animals, according to a 2019 and 2022 count, has become a popular hunting destination.

==Climate==
Adak has a subpolar oceanic climate (Koppen Cfc), characterized by persistently overcast skies, moderated temperatures, high winds, significant precipitation and frequent cyclonic storms.

At Adak, overcast conditions average nearly 75 percent of the time during June and July, dropping back to approximately 50 percent of the time from October through February. Adak averages 173 days per year with fog. The foggiest months are July and August, when an average of 26 of the 31 days have fog. This number drops dramatically toward the winter season, where the months of December through March have, on average, fewer than ten days with fog during any one month.

Gales occur in all months of the year at Adak, with the greatest chances being from December through March. A peak gust of occurred at Adak in March 1954.

Adak&#x27;s average temperatures range from , with a record high of in August 1956 and a record low of in January 1963 and February 1964.

Average annual precipitation is about . October to January are the wettest months due to especially frequent and intense mid-latitude cyclonic storms, while May to July represent markedly drier months; thunderstorms, common in mid-latitude continental areas, are virtually unknown here. November is the average wettest month, while July is the average driest month. Average snowfall is , falling primarily on the upper reaches of the volcanoes. Adak has an average of 341 days per year with measurable precipitation.

==Education==

Adak is served by the Aleutian Region Schools. The Adak School, now closed due to declining enrollment, used to serves grades K–12 and had around 20 students before it was officially shuttered on June 30, 2023.

==Economy==

A land exchange between Alaska Native Regional Corporations, the U.S. Navy, and the Department of the Interior has transferred most of the naval facilities to the Aleut Corp. A portion of the Island will remain within the National Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, managed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Adak currently provides a fueling port and crew transfer facility for foreign fishing fleets—an airport, docks, housing facilities and food services are available. A grocery and ship supply store and restaurant opened in February 1999. Aleut Corporation maintains the facilities. Contractors are performing an environmental clean-up. Alaskan-owned Norquest-Adak Seafood Co. processes Pacific cod, pollock, mackerel, halibut, albacore and brown king crab. Four residents hold a commercial fishing permit, primarily for groundfish.

In 2022, Netflix aired a docuseries about explorers seeking pirate gold on the island.

==Transportation==
Because of its naval aviation past, Adak has an unusually large and sophisticated airport for the Aleutian Islands. The Adak Airport is operated by the State of Alaska Department of Transportation. Adak Airport has a control tower, an Instrument Landing System and two runways; and respectively. Both runways are asphalt paved, wide and at an elevation of .

Alaska Airlines operates twice-weekly Boeing 737-800 passenger and cargo jet service from Anchorage. At present, flights operate each Wednesday and Saturday (weather permitting). Occasionally, extra seasonal flights are operated to meet the demand of the fishing season. Adak Airport was historically served for many years by Reeve Aleutian Airways (RAA), with scheduled passenger flights to Anchorage operated with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop combi aircraft during the 1970s, followed by Boeing 727-100 jet combi aircraft during the 1980s and 1990s.

Other facilities in Adak include three deep water docks and fueling facilities. The city has requested funds to greatly expand the Sweeper Cove small boat harbor, including new breakwaters, a 315-foot (96 m) dock and new moorage floats 

There are approximately of paved and primitive roads on Adak, all privately owned by the Aleut Corporation.

==Flora==

The Aleutian shield fern is an endangered species found only on this island.

Adak National Forest is a small copse on the island jokingly referred to as a national forest.

==Geology==
Adagdak and Mount Moffett volcanoes are located on Adak. The igneous rock type adakite is named after Adak.

<text>Julien Torma (Cambrai, 6 April 1902 – Tyrol, 17 February 1933) was credited as a French writer, playwright and poet who was part of the Dadaist movement.

Torma disappeared in the mountains of the Tyrol at the age of 30. Due to his secretive behaviour and the impossibility of verifying the supposed details of his life (i.e. no living or known family members and every writer he supposedly knew having died long before the publication of his posthumous books – if they are by the author of the early books, no professional career, no fixed address, his body having never been recovered, etc.), it has been suggested by some, including Jean-François Jeandillou, that Torma&#x27;s existence may be fictitious. His purported birthday, 6 April, is marked as &quot;the birthday of pataphysics&quot; in the &quot;pataphysics calendar&quot;. The real writer who authored the first four publications and &quot;Porte battantes&quot; would have had to be using a pen name, as, according to the French institute for statistics INSEE, only three Torma births have been recorded in France since 1891, all between 1941 and 1965.

<text>Fantasy literature is literature set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Magic, the supernatural and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy literature may be directed at both children and adults.

Fantasy is considered a genre of speculative fiction and is distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the absence of scientific or macabre themes, respectively, though these may overlap. Historically, most works of fantasy were in written form, but since the 1960s, a growing segment of the genre has taken the form of fantasy films, fantasy television programs, graphic novels, video games, music and art.

Many fantasy novels originally written for children and adolescents also attract an adult audience. Examples include &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Stories involving magic and terrible monsters have existed in spoken forms before the advent of printed literature. Classical mythology is replete with fantastical stories and characters, the best known (and perhaps the most relevant to modern fantasy) being the works of Homer (Greek) and Virgil (Roman).

The philosophy of Plato has had great influence on the fantasy genre. In the Christian Platonic tradition, the reality of other worlds, and an overarching structure of great metaphysical and moral importance, has lent substance to the fantasy worlds of modern works.

With Empedocles (), elements are often used in fantasy works as personifications of the forces of nature.

India has a long tradition of fantastical stories and characters, dating back to Vedic mythology. The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; (&quot;Fables of Bidpai&quot;), which some scholars believe was composed around the 3rd century BC. It is based on older oral traditions, including &quot;animal fables that are as old as we are able to imagine&quot;.

It was influential in Europe and the Middle East. It used various animal fables and magical tales to illustrate the central Indian principles of political science. Talking animals endowed with human qualities have now become a staple of modern fantasy.

The &quot;Baital Pachisi&quot; (&quot;Vikram and the Vampire&quot;), a collection of various fantasy tales set within a frame story is, according to Richard Francis Burton and Isabel Burton, &quot;the germ which culminated in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, and which also inspired the &quot;Golden Ass&quot; of Apuleius, (2nd century A.D). Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decamerone&quot; (c.1353) the &quot;Pentamerone&quot; (1634, 1636) and all that class of facetious fictitious literature.&quot;

&quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights)&quot; from the Middle East has been influential in the West since it was translated from the Arabic into French in 1704 by Antoine Galland. Many imitations were written, especially in France.

The Fornaldarsagas, Norse and Icelandic sagas, both of which are based on ancient oral tradition influenced the German Romantics, as well as William Morris, and J. R. R. Tolkien. The Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; has also had deep influence on the fantasy genre; although it was unknown for centuries and so not developed in medieval legend and romance, several fantasy works have retold the tale, such as John Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Grendel&quot;.

Celtic folklore and legend has been an inspiration for many fantasy works.

The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential, owing to its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work, the epic Mabinogion. One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of Evangeline Walton. The Irish Ulster Cycle and Fenian Cycle have also been plentifully mined for fantasy. Its greatest influence was, however, indirect. Celtic folklore and mythology provided a major source for the Arthurian cycle of chivalric romance: the Matter of Britain. Although the subject matter was heavily reworked by the authors, these romances developed marvels until they became independent of the original folklore and fictional, an important stage in the development of fantasy.

===From the 13th century===
Romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that reworked legends, fairy tales, and history to suit the readers&#x27; and hearers&#x27; tastes, but by they were out of fashion, and Miguel de Cervantes famously burlesqued them in his novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Still, the modern image of &quot;medieval&quot; is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word &quot;medieval&quot; evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and other romantic tropes.

===Renaissance===
At the time of the Renaissance romance continued to be popular, and the trend was to more fantastic fiction. The English &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; by Sir Thomas Malory (c.1408–1471) was written in prose, and the work dominates the Arthurian literature. Arthurian motifs have appeared steadily in literature from its publication, though the works have been a mix of fantasy and non-fantasy works. At the time, it and the Spanish &quot;Amadis de Gaula&quot; (1508), which was also written in prose, spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received. It later produced such masterpieces of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; and Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;. Ariosto&#x27;s tale in particular was a source text for many fantasies of adventure.

During the Renaissance, Giovanni Francesco Straparola wrote and published &quot;The Facetious Nights of Straparola&quot; (1550–1555), a collection of stories of which many are literary fairy tales. Giambattista Basile wrote and published the &quot;Pentamerone&quot;, which was the first collection of stories to contain solely what would later be known as fairy tales. The two works include the oldest recorded form of many well-known (and some more obscure) European fairy tales. This was the beginning of a tradition that would both influence the fantasy genre and be incorporated in it, as many works of fairytale fantasy appear to this day.

In a work on alchemy in the 16th century, Paracelsus (1493–1541) identified four types of beings with the four elements of alchemy: gnomes (earth elementals); undines (water); sylphs (air); and salamanders (fire). Most of these beings are found in folklore as well as alchemy, and their names are often used interchangeably with similar beings from folklore.

===Enlightenment===
Literary fairy tales, such as those written by Charles Perrault (1628–1703) and Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy (c.1650 – 1705), became very popular early in the Age of Enlightenment. Many of Perrault&#x27;s tales became fairy tale staples and were influential to later fantasy. When d&#x27;Aulnoy termed her works &quot;contes de fée&quot; (fairy tales), she invented the term that is now generally used for the genre, thus distinguishing such tales from those involving no marvels. This approach influenced later writers who took up the folk fairy tales in the same manner during the Romantic era.

Several fantasies aimed at an adult readership were also published in 18th century France, including Voltaire&#x27;s
&quot;contes philosophique&quot; &quot;The Princess of Babylon&quot; (1768) and &quot;The White Bull&quot; (1774). This era, however, was notably hostile to fantasy. Writers of the new types of fiction such as Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding were realistic in style, and many early realistic works were critical of fantastical elements in fiction.

However, in the Elizabethan era in England, fantasy literature became extraordinarily popular and fueled populist and anti-authoritarian sentiment during the 1590s. Topics that were written about included &quot;fairylands in which the sexes traded places [and] men and immortals mingl[ing]&quot;.

===Romanticism===
Romanticism, a movement of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, was a dramatic reaction to rationalism, challenging the priority of reason and promoting the importance of imagination and spirituality. Its success in rehabilitating imagination was of fundamental importance to the evolution of fantasy, and its interest in medieval romances provided many motifs to modern fantasy.

The Romantics invoked the medieval romance as a model for the works they wanted to produce, in contrast to the realism of the Enlightenment. One of the first literary results of this trend was the Gothic novel, a genre that began in Britain with &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764) by Horace Walpole. That work is considered the predecessor to both modern fantasy and modern horror fiction. Another noted Gothic novel which also contains a large amount of Arabian Nights-influenced fantasy elements is &quot;Vathek&quot; (1786) by William Thomas Beckford.

In the later part of the Romantic period, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and released them in printed form. The Brothers Grimm were inspired by the movement of German Romanticism in their 1812 collection &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot;, and they in turn inspired other collectors. Frequently their motivation stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from Romantic nationalism, in that many were inspired to save their own country&#x27;s folklore. Sometimes, as in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, they compiled existing folklore into an epic to match other nation&#x27;s, and sometimes, as in &quot;The Poems of Ossian&quot;, they fabricated folklore that should have been there. These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.

The Romantic interest in medievalism also resulted in a revival of interest in the literary fairy tale. The tradition begun with Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile and developed by Charles Perrault and the French précieuses was taken up by the German Romantic movement. The German author Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué created medieval-set stories such as &quot;Undine&quot; (1811) and &quot;Sintram and his Companions&quot; (1815), which would later inspire British writers such as George MacDonald and William Morris. 
E.T.A. Hoffmann&#x27;s tales, such as &quot;The Golden Pot&quot; (1814) and &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot; (1816) were notable additions to the canon of German fantasy. Ludwig Tieck&#x27;s collection &quot;Phantasus&quot; (1812–1817) contained several short fairy tales, including &quot;The Elves&quot;.

In France, the main writers of Romantic-era fantasy were Charles Nodier with &quot;Smarra&quot; (1821) and &quot;Trilby&quot; (1822) and Théophile Gautier who penned such stories as &quot;Omphale&quot; (1834) and &quot;One of Cleopatra&#x27;s Nights&quot; (1838) as well as the novel &quot;Spirite&quot; (1866).

===Victorian era===
Fantasy literature was popular in Victorian times, with the works of writers such as Mary Shelley, William Morris, George MacDonald, and Charles Dodgson reaching wider audiences.

Hans Christian Andersen took a new approach to fairy tales by creating original stories told in a serious fashion. From this origin, John Ruskin wrote &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; (1851), a fairy tale that included complex levels of characterization and created in the Southwest Wind an irascible but kindly character similar to J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s later Gandalf.

The history of modern fantasy literature began with George MacDonald, author of such novels as &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; (1868) and &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1868), the latter of which is widely considered to be the first fantasy novel written for adults. MacDonald also wrote one of the first critical essays about the fantasy genre, &quot;The Fantastic Imagination&quot;, in his book &quot;A Dish of Orts&quot; (1893). MacDonald was a major influence on both Tolkien and C. S. Lewis.

The other major fantasy author of this era was William Morris, an admirer of the Middle Ages and a poet who wrote several fantastic romances and novels in the latter part of the 19th century, including &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot; (1896). Morris was inspired by the medieval sagas, and his writing was deliberately archaic in the style of the chivalric romances. Morris&#x27;s work represented an important milestone in the history of fantasy, as while other writers wrote of foreign lands or of dream worlds, Morris was the first to set his stories in an entirely invented world.

Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde also contributed to the development of fantasy with their writing of horror stories. Wilde also wrote a large number of children&#x27;s fantasies, collected in &quot;The Happy Prince and Other Stories&quot; (1888) and &quot;A House of Pomegranates&quot; (1891). H. Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the lost world subgenre with his novel &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885), which presented a fantastical Africa to a European audience still unfamiliar with the continent. Other writers, including Edgar Rice Burroughs and Abraham Merritt, further developed the style.

Several classic children&#x27;s fantasies such as Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865), L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), as well as the work of E. Nesbit and Frank R. Stockton were also published around this time. C. S. Lewis noted that in the earlier part of the 20th century, fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature, and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote for that audience, despite using concepts and themes that could form a work aimed at adults.

At this time, the terminology for the genre was not settled. Many fantasies in this era were termed fairy tales, including Max Beerbohm&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Hypocrite&quot; (1896) and MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Phantastes&quot;. It was not until 1923 that the term &quot;fantasist&quot; was used to describe a writer (in this case, Oscar Wilde) who wrote fantasy fiction. The name &quot;fantasy&quot; was not developed until later; as late as J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), the term &quot;fairy tale&quot; was still being used.

===After 1901===
An important factor in the development of the fantasy genre was the arrival of magazines devoted to fantasy fiction. The first such publication was the German magazine &quot;Der Orchideengarten&quot; which ran from 1919 to 1921. In 1923, the first English-language fantasy fiction magazine, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, was created. Many other similar magazines eventually followed. and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;

H. P. Lovecraft was deeply influenced by Edgar Allan Poe and to a somewhat lesser extent, by Lord Dunsany; with his Cthulhu Mythos stories, he became one of the most influential writers of fantasy and horror in the 20th century.

Despite MacDonald&#x27;s future influence, and Morris&#x27; popularity at the time, it was not until around the start of the 20th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience, with authors such as Lord Dunsany (1878–1957) who, following Morris&#x27;s example, wrote fantasy novels, but also in the short story form. He was particularly noted for his vivid and evocative style. His style greatly influenced many writers, not always happily; Ursula K. Le Guin, in her essay on style in fantasy &quot;From Elfland to Poughkeepsie&quot;, wryly referred to Lord Dunsany as the &quot;First Terrible Fate that Awaiteth Unwary Beginners in Fantasy&quot;, alluding to young writers attempting to write in Lord Dunsany&#x27;s style. According to S. T. Joshi, &quot;Dunsany&#x27;s work had the effect of segregating fantasy—a mode whereby the author creates his own realm of pure imagination—from supernatural horror. From the foundations he established came the later work of E. R. Eddison, Mervyn Peake, and J. R. R. Tolkien.

In Britain in the aftermath of World War I, a notably large number of fantasy books aimed at an adult readership were published, including &quot;Living Alone&quot; (1919) by Stella Benson, &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920) by David Lindsay, &quot;Lady into Fox&quot; (1922) by David Garnett, &quot;Lud-in-the-Mist&quot; (1926) by Hope Mirrlees, and &quot;Lolly Willowes&quot; (1926) by Sylvia Townsend Warner. E. R. Eddison was another influential writer who wrote during this era. He drew inspiration from Northern sagas, as Morris did, but his prose style was modeled more on Tudor and Elizabethan English, and his stories were filled with vigorous characters in glorious adventures. Eddison&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922), a long heroic fantasy set on an imaginary version of the planet Mercury.

Literary critics of the era began to take an interest in &quot;fantasy&quot; as a genre of writing, and also to argue that it was a genre worthy of serious consideration. Herbert Read devoted a chapter of his book &quot;English Prose Style&quot; (1928) to discussing &quot;Fantasy&quot; as an aspect of literature, arguing it was unjustly considered suitable only for children: &quot;The Western World does not seem to have conceived the necessity of Fairy Tales for Grown-Ups&quot;.

In 1938, with the publication of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, T. H. White introduced one of the most notable works of comic fantasy.

The first major contribution to the genre after World War II was Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Titus Groan&quot; (1946), the book that launched the Gormenghast series. J. R. R. Tolkien played a large role in the popularization and accessibility of the fantasy genre with his highly successful publications &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55). Tolkien was largely influenced by an ancient body of Anglo-Saxon myths, particularly &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as well as William Morris&#x27;s romances and E. R. Eddison&#x27;s 1922 novel, &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s close friend C. S. Lewis, author of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–56) and a fellow English professor with a similar array of interests, also helped to publicize the fantasy genre. Tove Jansson, author of &quot;The Moomins&quot;, was also a strong contributor to the popularity of fantasy literature in the field of children and adults.
The tradition established by these predecessors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has continued to thrive and be adapted by new authors. The influence of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s fiction has—particularly over the genre of high fantasy—prompted a reaction.

In China, the idea of fantasy literature as a distinct genre first became prevalent in the early 21st century. China has long had pre-genre stories with fantastical elements, including &quot;zhiguai&quot;, ghost stories, and miracle tales, among others.

It is not uncommon for fantasy novels to be ranked on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and some have been at number one on the list, including most recently, Brandon Sanderson in 2014, Neil Gaiman in 2013, Patrick Rothfuss and George R. R. Martin in 2011, and Terry Goodkind in 2006.

==Style==

Symbolism often plays a significant role in fantasy literature, often through the use of archetypal figures inspired by earlier texts or folklore. Some argue that fantasy literature and its archetypes fulfill a function for individuals and society and the messages are continually updated for current societies.

Ursula K. Le Guin, in her essay &quot;From Elfland to Poughkeepsie&quot;, presented the idea that language is the most crucial element of high fantasy, because it creates a sense of place. She analyzed the misuse of a formal, &quot;olden-day&quot; style, saying that it was a dangerous trap for fantasy writers because it was ridiculous when done wrong. She warns writers away from trying to base their style on that of masters such as Lord Dunsany and E. R. Eddison, emphasizing that language that is too bland or simplistic creates the impression that the fantasy setting is simply a modern world in disguise, and presents examples of clear, effective fantasy writing in brief excerpts from Tolkien and Evangeline Walton.

Michael Moorcock observed that many writers use archaic language for its sonority and to lend color to a lifeless story. Brian Peters writes that in various forms of fairytale fantasy, even the villain&#x27;s language might be inappropriate if vulgar.

<doc id="978768" wikidata="Q1568549" url="?curid=978768" title="Vulvectomy">
<text>Vulvectomy refers to a gynecological procedure in which the vulva is partly or completely removed. The procedure is usually performed as a last resort in certain cases of cancer, vulvar dysplasia, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, or as part of female genital mutilation. Although there may be severe pain in the groin area after the procedure, for a number of weeks, sexual function is generally still possible but limited.
==Types==
A simple vulvectomy can be either complete (more than 80% of the vulvar area) or partial (less than 80% of vulvar area). It removes the skin and superficial subcutaneous tissues. A radical vulvectomy is the same with regard to complete or partial, however, includes removal of skin and deep subcutaneous tissue. An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy may be performed along with a radical vulvectomy (whether partial or complete) on one or both sides if spread of a cancer is suspected.

A simple partial vulvectomy is the least severe, only removing the affected portion of the vulva.

A &quot;skinning vulvectomy&quot; is the removal of the top layer of vulvar skin (the external female genital organs, including the clitoris, vaginal lips and the opening of the vagina). In this case skin grafts from other parts of the body may be needed to cover the area. There are two types of skinning vulvectomy, the &quot;partial&quot; and the &quot;total&quot;. The objective of the first is the preservation of the cosmetic and functional integrity of the vulva in younger and sexually active patients, in whom a steady increase in the incidence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia has been observed in the last decade. The objective of the latter is the removal of the entire vulva with total skin graft replacement in patients with an entire vulvar cancer involvement. &quot;Modified radical vulvectomy&quot; involves the removal of vulva containing cancer and some of the normal tissue around it.

<doc id="978770" wikidata="Q2973648" url="?curid=978770" title="Division of Higgins">
<text>The Division of Higgins is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria for the Australian House of Representatives. The division covers in Melbourne&#x27;s inner south-eastern suburbs. The main suburbs include , , , , , , Malvern East, Murrumbeena, Prahran and ; along with parts of , and South Yarra. Though historically a safe conservative seat, Higgins was won by the Liberal Party by a margin of just 3.9 percent over the Labor Party at the 2019 election, the closest result in the seat’s history. It then flipped to Labor in the 2022 election.

Higgins is a largely white-collar electorate. According to the , 52.4% of electors hold a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree, slightly more than twice the national average.

The current member for Higgins, since the 2022 federal election, is Michelle Ananda-Rajah, a member of the Australian Labor Party, and the first Labor member in the seat&#x27;s history.

In 2024, the Australian Electoral Commission announced that the seat would be abolished in the Victorian federal electorate redistribution, effective from the 2025 Australian federal election, with its electors distributed across the divisions of Melbourne, Kooyong, Hotham, Macnamara and Chisholm.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History ==

The division was created in 1949. Like other seats in inner-eastern Melbourne, Higgins had historically been a stronghold for the Liberal Party. It was considered a &quot;leadership seat&quot;, in part because the seat&#x27;s first two members, Harold Holt and Sir John Gorton, were Prime Ministers of Australia in the period between 1966 and 1971.

More recently, the seat was held by Peter Costello, a prominent member of the Howard government as the longest serving Treasurer of Australia and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. Costello resigned from the seat on 19 October 2009, and was succeeded in the ensuing by-election by fellow Liberal Kelly O&#x27;Dwyer, who would go on to become a minister in the Abbott and Turnbull governments.

O&#x27;Dwyer retired in 2019. At that election, Labor came reasonably close to winning this seat for the first time ever, with Labor&#x27;s highest two-party preferred vote in the history of the seat (46.12%). Liberal candidate Katie Allen, however, saw off a challenge from barrister Fiona McLeod, despite suffering a swing of six percent, making Higgins marginal against Labor for the first time ever. Allen became the first Liberal candidate to come up short of an outright majority on the first count. High-profile Greens candidate and former Australian Rules footballer Jason Ball also contested the seat, receiving almost a quarter of the vote.

At the 2022 election, Labor took the seat for the first time. While Allen led Labor challenger Michelle Ananda-Rajah for most of the night, on the seventh count the Green candidate&#x27;s preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Ananda-Rajah, allowing Ananda-Rajah to win on a swing of 4.7 percent.

Higgins is the only Division to have been held by two Prime Ministers. This occurred when Holt went missing while Prime Minister, and then-Senator Gorton used the ensuing by-election to transfer to the House. Prior to 2022, it had only been out of Liberal hands for eight months in its existence, when Gorton became an independent to protest against Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s becoming Liberal leader.

The seat is one of the few to have produced two federal Treasurers; Holt and Costello served as Treasurers during their respective tenure in Higgins. Another member, Kelly O&#x27;Dwyer had a stint as Assistant Treasurer.

==Name==
The division is named after Justice H. B. Higgins (1851–1929), who was a Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (1894) and president of the Carlton Football Club (1904). He was a founding Member of Australian House of Representatives, serving as the Protectionist member for Northern Melbourne and was the Attorney-General in the Watson government (1904). He went on to become a Justice of the High Court of Australia (1906–1929)

<doc id="978777" wikidata="Q529021" url="?curid=978777" title="Neo-Gramscianism">
<text>Neo-Gramscianism is a critical theory approach to the study of international relations (IR) and the global political economy (GPE) that explores the interface of ideas, institutions and material capabilities as they shape the specific contours of the state formation. The theory is heavily influenced by the writings of Antonio Gramsci. Neo-Gramscianism analyzes how the particular constellation of social forces, the state and the dominant ideational configuration define and sustain world orders. In this sense, the neo-Gramscian approach breaks the decades-old stalemate between the realist schools of thought and the liberal theories by historicizing the very theoretical foundations of the two streams as part of a particular world order and finding the interlocking relationship between agency and structure. Karl Polanyi, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Michel Foucault are cited as major sources within the critical theory of IR.

== Origins of the neo-Gramscian perspective ==
The beginning of the neo-Gramscian perspective can be traced to York University professor emeritus Robert W. Cox&#x27;s article &quot;Social Forces, States and World Orders: Beyond International Relations Theory&quot; in &quot;&quot; 10 (1981) 2 and &quot;Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method&quot;, published in &quot;Millennium&quot; 12 (1983) 2. In his 1981 article, Cox demands a critical study of IR as opposed to the usual &quot;problem-solving&quot; theories, which do not interrogate the origin, nature and development of historical structures, but accept for example that states and the (supposedly) &quot;anarchic&quot; relationships between them as Kantian &quot;Dinge an sich&quot;.

However, Cox disavows the label neo-Gramscian despite the fact that in a follow-up article he showed how Gramsci&#x27;s thought can be used to analyze power structures within the GPE. Particularly Gramsci&#x27;s concept of cultural hegemony, vastly different from the realists&#x27; conception of hegemony, appears fruitful. Gramsci&#x27;s state theory, his conception of &quot;historic blocs&quot;—dominant configurations of material capabilities, ideologies and institutions as determining frames for individual and collective action—and of élites acting as &quot;organic intellectuals&quot; forging historic blocs, is also deemed useful.

The neo-Gramscian approach has also been developed along somewhat different lines by Cox&#x27;s colleague, Stephen Gill, distinguished research professor of political science at York University. Gill contributed to showing how the elite Trilateral Commission acted as an &quot;organic intellectual&quot;, forging the (currently hegemonic) ideology of neoliberalism and the so-called Washington Consensus and later in relation to the globalization of power and resistance in his book &quot;Power and Resistance in the New World Order&quot; (Palgrave, 2003). Gill also partnered with fellow Canadian academic A. Claire Cutler to release a neo-Gramscian inspired volume entitled &quot;New Constitutionalism and World Order&quot; (Cambridge, 2014). The book brings together a selection of critical theorists and neo-Gramscians to analyze the disciplinary power of legal and constitutional innovations in the global political economy. Co-editor A. Claire Cutler has been a pioneer scholar detailing a neo-Gramscian theory of international law. Outside of North America, the so-called Amsterdam School around Kees van der Pijl and Henk Overbeek (at VU University Amsterdam) and individual researchers in Germany, notably in Düsseldorf, Kassel and Marburg as well as at the Centre for Global Political Economy at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world, have adopted the neo-Gramscian critical method. Christoph Scherrer at the University of Kassel is one of the leading neo-Gramscian theorists in Germany who introduced the concept of &quot;double hegemony&quot;. He represents the critical global political economy approach in Germany.

== Basics of the neo-Gramscian perspective ==
In the mainstream approaches to international or global political economy, the theoretical primacy of the state is not in question. In contrast, neo-Gramscianism, using an approach which Henk Overbeek, Professor of International Relations at the VU University Amsterdam, calls transnational historical materialism, &quot;identifies state formation and interstate politics as moments of the transnational dynamics of capital accumulation and class formation&quot;.

Neo-Gramscianism perceives state sovereignty as subjugated to a global economic system marked by the emergence of a transnational financial system and a corresponding transnational system of production. The major players in these systems, multinational corporations and international financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, have evolved into a &quot;transnational historic bloc&quot; that exercises global hegemony (in contrast to the realist view of hegemony as the &quot;predominant power of a state or a group of states&quot;). The historic bloc acquires its authority through the tacit consent of the governed population gained through coercive techniques of intellectual and cultural persuasion, largely absent violence. It links itself to other social groups that have been involved in political struggles to expand its influence and seeks to solidify its power through the standardization and liberalization of national economies, creating a single regulatory regime (e.g. World Trade Organization).

There are powerful forces opposing the progress of this historic bloc who may form counterhegemonies to challenge it as part of an open-ended class struggle. These might include neo-mercantilists who depend on the protection of tariffs and state subsidies, or alliances of lesser developed countries, or identitarian and environmentalist movements in the industrialized West. If a counterhegemony grows large enough, it is able to subsume and replace the historic bloc it was born in. Neo-Gramscians use the Machiavellian terms &quot;war of position&quot; and &quot;war of movement&quot; to explain how this is possible. In a war of position, a counterhegemonic movement attempts through persuasion or propaganda to increase the number of people who share its view on the hegemonic order whereas in a war of movement the counterhegemonic tendencies which have grown large enough to overthrow, violently or democratically, the current hegemony and establish themselves as a new historic bloc&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Night of the Iguana is a stage play written by American author Tennessee Williams. It is based on his 1948 short story. In 1959, Williams staged it as a one-act play, and over the next two years he developed it into a full-length play, producing two different versions in 1959 and 1960, and then arriving at the three-act version that premiered on Broadway in 1961. Two film adaptations have been made: The Oscar-winning 1964 film directed by John Huston and starring Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, and Deborah Kerr, and a 2000 Croatian production.

==Description==
The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon characterizes the Western image of God as a &quot;senile delinquent&quot; during a sermon and is locked out of his church. Shannon is not defrocked, but he is institutionalized for a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. In 1940s Mexico, some time after his release, the Rev. Shannon is working as a tour guide for a second-rate travel agency. Shortly before the opening of the play, Shannon is accused of committing statutory rape of a 16-year-old girl, Charlotte Goodall, who is among his current group of tourists.

As the curtain rises, Shannon and a group of women arrive at a cheap hotel on the coast of Mexico managed by his friends Fred and Maxine Faulk. Fred has recently died, and Maxine has assumed sole responsibility for managing the establishment.

Struggling emotionally, Shannon tries to manage his tour party, who have turned against him for having sexual relations with the minor, and Maxine is interested in him for purely carnal reasons. Adding to this chaotic scenario, spinster Hannah Jelkes appears with her elderly grandfather, Nonno, who, despite his failing health, is composing his last poem. Jelkes, who scrapes by as a traveling painter and sketch artist, is soon at Maxine&#x27;s mercy. Shannon, who wields considerable influence over Maxine, offers Hannah shelter for the night. The play&#x27;s main axis is the development of the deeply human bond between Hannah and Shannon.

Minor characters in the play include a group of German tourists whose Nazi marching songs paradoxically lighten the heavier themes of the play while suggesting the horrors of World War II; the Mexican &quot;boys&quot; Maxine employs to help run the hotel who ignore her laconic commands; and Judith Fellowes, the &quot;butch&quot; vocal teacher charged with Charlotte&#x27;s care during the trip.

The Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon was based partly on Williams&#x27; cousin and close friend, the Reverend Sidney Lanier, the iconoclastic rector of St. Clement&#x27;s Episcopal Church, New York. Lanier was a significant figure in the New York theater scene in the 1950s and 1960s, started a Ministry to the Theatre Arts, and became co-founder of the experimental American Place Theatre in 1962. Lanier resigned from his ministry in May 1965.

== Original Broadway production ==
The play premiered on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on December 28, 1961, and ran for 316 performances. It starred Patrick O&#x27;Neal as Rev. Shannon, two-time Oscar winner Bette Davis as Maxine, and Margaret Leighton as Hannah. Davis left the production after four months and was replaced by Shelley Winters.

Maxine, Davis&#x27;s role, is a lusty life-force of a woman, with some good comic lines, who is offstage for a significant part of the play, while Hannah is on. The play featured Louis Guss, Bruce Glover, James Farentino, and Alan Webb as the dying grandfather to whom Hannah is devoted. The production was directed by Frank Corsaro. (In her memoir, &quot;Dark Victory,&quot; Davis wrote that she banned Corsaro from rehearsals shortly before opening). The play was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Play. Leighton, as Hannah, won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

==Film versions==
John Huston directed the 1964 film and co-wrote the screenplay with Anthony Veiller. It stars Richard Burton as Rev. Shannon, Ava Gardner as Maxine and Deborah Kerr as Hannah. The cast includes Sue Lyon, Cyril Delevanti, Grayson Hall (who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Miss Fellowes) and Barbara Joyce (who later became an artist). 

The film won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design (B&amp;W), and was nominated for Art Direction and for Cinematography (by Gabriel Figueroa), as well as for Hall&#x27;s performance.

The film eliminates the Nazi tourists and the character of Jake Latta, and Shannon is fired through a comical telephone call.

A Croatian film adaptation, directed by Janusz Kica, was released in 2000.

==1975 -1976 revival (LA and Broadway)==
Joseph Hardy directed a revival which ran December 19 1975 to January 31 1976 at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. The cast was headlined by Richard Chamberlain (Reverend Shannon), Eleanor Parker (Maxine Faulk), Dorothy McGuire (Hannah Jelkes), Raymond Massey (Jonathan &quot;Nonno&quot; Coffin), and Allyn Ann McLerie (Miss Judith Fellowes): featured cast members were Susan Lanier (Charlotte Goodall), Jennifer Savidge (Hilda), Norma Connolly (Frau Fahrenkopf), Michael Ross Verona (Herr Fahrenkopf), Benjamin Stewart (Jake Latta), Ben Van Vacter (Wolfgang), Matt Bennett (Hank), José Martin (Pedro), and Ricardo Landeros (Pancho). 

The production encored at the Circle in the Square Theatre on Broadway with a limited December 16 1976 to February 20 1977 run, with three recastings among the headliners: Sylvia Miles (Maxine), William Roerick (Nonno), and Barbara Caruso (Miss Fellowes). Along with Savidge, Stewart, Van Vacter and Bennett reprising their LA roles, the supporting cast consisted of Allison Argo (Charlotte Goodall), Gary Tacon (Pedro), William Paulson (Pancho), John Rose (Herr Fahrenkopf), and Amelia Laurenson (Frau Fahrenkopf). The Broadway production featured scenery and lighting by H.R. Poindexter, and costumes by Noel Taylor, with Randall Brooks as production stage manager and James Bernadi as stage manager.

<text>Guillaume Henri Dufour (; 15 September 178714 July 1875) was a Swiss military officer, structural engineer and topographer. He served under Napoleon I and held the Swiss office of General four times in his career, firstly in 1847 when he led the Swiss Confederation forces to victory against the Sonderbund. In 1864 Dufour presided over the First Geneva Convention which established the International Red Cross. He was founder and president (1838 to 1865) of the Swiss Federal Office of Topography.

==Early life==
Dufour was born on 15 September 1787 in Konstanz, where his parents from Geneva were living in exile for their involvement in the Revolution of 1782. He was the son of Bénédict Dufour, a watchmaker, and Pernette Valentin. When he was two years old, his parents were allowed to return to Geneva, where Dufour attended school and studied drawing and medicine. In 1807, Dufour travelled to Paris to join the , then a military academy. He studied descriptive geometry under Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette, and graduated fifth in his class in 1809, going on to study military engineering at the École d&#x27;Application in Metz. 

==Career==
In 1811, Dufour joined the French Army and was sent to help defend Corfu, in the French Ionian Islands, where he mapped the island&#x27;s old fortifications. He was wounded in action in June 1813 during a naval battle against the British. By 1814, he had attained the rank of captain, and was awarded the Cross of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur for his work repairing fortifications at Lyon. In 1817, he resumed his status as a Swiss citizen, and returned to Geneva to become commander of the Canton of Geneva&#x27;s military engineers, as well as a professor of mathematics at the Academy of Geneva. From 1819 to 1830 he was chief instructor in the military school of Thun, which had been founded mainly through his efforts. Among other distinguished foreign pupils he instructed Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the former Emperor.

In 1827 he was raised to the rank of colonel, and commanded the Federal army in a series of field manoeuvres. In 1831 he became chief of the staff, and soon afterwards he was appointed quartermaster-general. Two years later the Federal Diet commissioned him to superintend the execution of a complete trigonometrical survey of Switzerland. He had already made a cadastral survey of the canton of Geneva, and published a map of the canton on the scale of 1⁄25000. The final map in 25 sheets on the scale of 1⁄100000 was published at intervals between 1842 and 1865.

In 1847 the Catholic cantons of Switzerland attempted to form a separate alliance of their own, known as the Sonderbund, effectively splitting from the rest of the country. The Federal Diet appointed Dufour General on 21 October 1847, and he led the federal army of 100,000 and defeated the Sonderbund under Johann-Ulrich von Salis-Soglio in a campaign that lasted only from 3 to 29 November, and claimed fewer than a hundred victims. He ordered his troops to spare the injured. For example, on November 13, 1847, when everything was ready for the offensive, he sent Lieutenant de Cerjat as an emissary to the authorities of the city of Fribourg enjoining them to surrender in order to avoid a deadly battle. With his mindful approach in the Sonderbund War, Dufour not only prevented a collapse of the Confederation through intervention by foreign powers, but he also created a basis of reconciliation that enabled the cantons to agree on a common federal state already in 1848. His success, and the moderation with which he treated his vanquished fellow-countrymen, were acknowledged by a gift of 60,000 francs from the Federal Diet and various honours from different cities and cantons of the confederation.

In addition to serving in the position of General in 1847 due to the Sonderbund War, the Federal Assembly appointed him to the same position in August 1849 due to the Baden Revolution, on 27 December 1856 due to the Neuchâtel Crisis, and in 1859 due to the Second Italian War of Independence.

In 1850 the mountaineer and topographer Johann Coaz served as his private secretary.

In 1863 he was part of a committee with Gustave Moynier, Henry Dunant, Louis Appia and Théodore Maunoir that discussed Dunant&#x27;s ideas for the creation of a voluntary care organization for the assistance of the wounded in battle. Dunant&#x27;s vision and the committees work ultimately led to the foundation of the International Red Cross. The following year he presided over the international conference which framed the First Geneva Convention as to the treatment of the wounded in time of war.

On 16 July 1875, 60,000 persons participated at Dufour&#x27;s burial at Cimetière de Plainpalais in Geneva.

==Saint Antoine Bridge==
Dufour acted as state engineer from 1817, although he was not officially appointed as such until 1828. His work included rebuilding a pumping station, quays and bridges, and he arranged the first steam boat on Lake Geneva as well as the introduction of gas streetlights.

The scientist Marc-Auguste Pictet had visited Marc Seguin&#x27;s temporary wire-cable simple suspension bridge at Annonay in 1822, the first wire-cable bridge in the world, and published details in Switzerland. He joined with others to promote a new bridge across the Genevan fortifications, consulting with Seguin on how it might be built, receiving back a series of sketches. Dufour developed the design in late 1822, proposing a two-span suspension bridge using wire cables — this would become the first permanent wire cable suspension bridge in the world. The design used three cables on each side of an iron and timber bridge deck. The cables stretched 131 feet between the towers, although the largest span was only 109 feet.

==Memorials==
Memorials are at:
*Equestrian statue (1884) by Alfred Lanz, at Place de Neuve, Geneva, erected by public subscription
*Two plaques on his birth house at Wessenbergstraße 14 (formerly Plattengasse), Konstanz, Germany
*Plaque at the building where he lived from 1826 to 1845 at Geneva
*Plaque at Château de Montrottier in Lovagny, France
*Plaque at 22, rue Saint-Victor, Carouge, commemorating its use as office of topography.
*Bronze bust, made by Fonderie Leuba, B. Brasseur, succ. at Army Training Center, Lucerne

His home from 1845–1875 at Rue de Contamines, Geneva, is preserved by a foundation.

Numerous cities and towns in Switzerland have streets named for him: &quot;rue du Général-Dufour&quot; in Geneva, La Chaux-de-Fonds; &quot;via Gen. Henri Dufour&quot; in Chiasso; &quot;rue du Général- Dufour/General-Dufour-Strasse&quot; in Biel/Bienne; 
&quot;Dufourstrasse&quot; in Aarau, Basel, Bern, Biberist, Lenzburg, Luzern, Rorschach, St. Gallen, Thun, Weinfelden, Wettingen, Wil, Zollikon, Zürich; &quot;via Dufour&quot; in Lugano. There is also &quot;Dufourplatz&quot; in Zollikon.

The general was depicted on the 20 francs note of the 1956 series of Swiss banknotes (in circulation 1956–1980).

The Dufourspitze (the highest mountain peak in Switzerland and second of Western Europe) in the Monte Rosa Massif is named after Dufour, to honour his cartographic achievements.

<text>Paul Hayden Desser (born February 12, 1971), who records as Hayden, is a Canadian singer-songwriter from Thornhill, Ontario.

His early works are a largely eclectic mix of genres from grunge to alternative country, as demonstrated by his first full album, &quot;Everything I Long For&quot;, released in 1995. Since then his work has become progressively more refined.

== Early life and education==

Hayden entered his song &quot;Take&quot; in for CFNY-FM&#x27;s annual &quot;New Music Search&quot; competition in 1993. Hayden played guitar on the track and enlisted two friends (Lorraine Ursomarzo and Noah Mintz of hHead) to sing vocals. Hayden continued to recruit vocalists until 1995 when he began to showcase his grainy baritone. &quot;Take&quot; has never been officially released on any of Hayden&#x27;s albums.

Hayden released an independent cassette, &quot;In September&quot;, in 1994, and followed with the album &quot;Everything I Long For&quot; in 1995. Released on his own Hardwood Records with distribution by Sonic Unyon, the album was a commercial success. He subsequently found himself in a bidding war between record labels in the United States, with one early offer coming directly from Neil Young, whose manager Elliott Roberts had just launched Vapor Records.

He ultimately signed to Geffen Records&#x27; subsidiary imprint Outpost Recordings, which gave him a contract worth over $1 million, along with complete creative control of his music, in what was widely reported as one of the most lucrative contracts ever given to a new artist in the alternative rock era. Outpost rereleased the album in the US the following year. Also in 1996, Hayden performed both nights of Neil Young&#x27;s annual Bridge School Concert, and contributed the title track to the soundtrack for Steve Buscemi&#x27;s film &quot;Trees Lounge&quot;.

For his second album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Closer I Get&quot;, Hayden worked with several big name record producers, including Steve Fisk, John Hanlon and Scott Litt. He toured North America with a full band, including Josh Malinsky and Mitch Roth of Poledo and Damon Richardson of Change of Heart, to support that album. However, Outpost was subsequently dissolved due to the commercial decline of alternative rock in the late 1990s, leaving Hayden without an international label.

In 2001, Hayden distributed 100 hand-written, packaged and numbered copies of &quot;Skyscraper National Park&quot; to friends and independent record shops throughout Toronto. This was quickly followed by an additional 1,500 hand-numbered copies, this time with professionally printed liner notes. These copies were primarily sold at live shows. The critical success of these two limited-edition runs led to a full commercial release of the recording later that same year.

In 2004, Hayden released his follow up album, &quot;Elk Lake Serenade&quot;, and toured North America with Oshawa&#x27;s Cuff the Duke acting as his back-up band. He subsequently released &quot;In Field &amp; Town&quot; in 2008, and &quot;The Place Where We Lived&quot; in 2009.

In 2010, he produced the debut album of singer-songwriter Lou Canon, his sister-in-law. It was his first time producing material for another artist.

In November 2012, it was announced that Hayden would release his seventh studio album on Canadian indie label Arts &amp; Crafts, and would play five shows in Europe as a warm up to his performance at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties Festival, curated by the National. These were Hayden&#x27;s first live performances since his two-song set at a benefit in Ontario over a year earlier.

On February 5, 2013, Hayden released his seventh full-length studio album &quot;Us Alone&quot; on Arts &amp; Crafts, his first release on a record label besides his own Hardwood Records. The album is largely biographical in nature, with tracks like &quot;Almost Everything&quot; noting how family now takes precedence over art in his life, and &quot;Instructions&quot;, which details what he wants done with his body when he dies. In June 2013, the album was longlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.

In February 2023 he released the single &quot;Miss Fort Erie&quot;, his first new music since 2015. He followed up at the end of the month with the announcement that his new album &quot;Are We Good&quot; will be released April 5, 2023, on Arts &amp; Crafts; the announcement was accompanied by the release of the album&#x27;s second preview track, a duet with Feist titled &quot;On a Beach&quot;. Actor Steve Buscemi and musician Matt Berninger of The National appeared in the song&#x27;s video.

&quot;Are We Good&quot; received a Juno Award nomination for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2024.

==Promotion==
Often described in the press as somewhat reclusive and private, since the end of his international tour to support &quot;The Closer I Get&quot; Hayden has often limited his active promotional appearances and undertaken only small-scale touring. As early as 2002, friends were jokingly referring to his concert dates to support &quot;Skyscraper National Park&quot; as &quot;the Hayden&#x27;s Not Dead Tour&quot;, and there was already at least one Usenet group devoted primarily to tracking rumoured Hayden sightings.

He also undertook virtually no promotional efforts for his 2009 album &quot;The Place Where We Lived&quot;.

In 2010, an erroneous rumour that he had died was propagated in several online venues, including Wikipedia; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; music critic Robert Everett-Green has speculated that the rumour may have been caused by confusion with Canadian R&amp;B singer Haydain Neale, who died in November 2009.

Upon the release of his follow-up album &quot;Us Alone&quot; in 2013, he joked that &quot;I think I realized that you need to let people know you have a record out,&quot; and acknowledged that the death rumour was a key influence on his decision to sign with Arts &amp; Crafts, rather than continuing to handle his promotional efforts on his own.

In recent years, Hayden has organized and performed at Dream Serenade, an annual charity concert in Toronto to benefit children with special needs.

== Hardwood records ==
In Canada, almost all of Hayden&#x27;s albums have been issued by Hardwood Records, a small music label he owns. Hardwood&#x27;s distribution was handled by Sonic Unyon for &quot;Everything I Long For&quot;, and by Universal Music Canada thereafter. From its inception in 1994 until 2005, Hayden&#x27;s own albums were all that the Hardwood label carried, but since then the label has also released albums by Cuff the Duke, Basia Bulat and Lou Canon.

His 2013 album &quot;Us Alone&quot; was his first album to be released on Arts &amp; Crafts.

<text>Sid Ahmed Ghozali (; 31 March 1937 – 4 February 2025) was an Algerian politician who was the Prime Minister of Algeria from 1991 to 1992.

== Life and career ==
Ghozali was a member of the National Liberation Front party and an ally of President Houari Boumedienne, under whom he served as head of Sonatrach from 1966 to 1977, when he became Minister of Energy and Industry. He was removed from this post by the new president Chadli Bendjedid in 1979, becoming ambassador to France, but was brought back in 1988 as Minister of Finance until 1989, then foreign minister until 1991. On 5 June 1991, he succeeded Mouloud Hamrouche as Prime Minister; he remained Prime Minister following the January 1992 resignation of Bendjedid and takeover by the military, but he resigned on 8 July that year, shortly after the assassination of Mohammed Boudiaf. He ran for president in the 1999 elections, and attempted to do so again in 2004, but was disqualified by the Constitutional Council.

Ghozali died in Algiers on 4 February 2025, at the age of 87.

<text>Nalgonda is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Telangana. It is the headquarters of the Nalgonda district, as well as the headquarters of the Nalgonda mandal in the Nalgonda revenue division. It is located about from the state capital Hyderabad.

== Etymology ==
In the past, Nalgonda was referred to as &quot;Nilagiri&quot;. During the medieval Bahamani kingdom, it was renamed Nalgunda. The name was changed to &quot;Nalgonda&quot; for official uses during the rule of the later Nizam kings.

== History ==
=== Paleolithic Age ===
There is archaeological evidence that Paleolithic people lived in the area that is now Nalgonda, fashioning tools and weapons out of stone. Some of these implements have been found in the Nalgonda area, similar to those discovered at the Sloan archaeological site in Arkansas.

=== Neolithic Age ===
Traces of Neolithic culture were found at Chota Yelupu, where sling stones and other contemporary objects were excavated. Evidence of Megalithic culture was also found via the discovery of innumerable burials at various places around Nalgonda.

=== The Mauryas and Satavahanas (230 BC – 218 BC) ===
The political history of the Nalgonda district commences with the Mauryas. During the reign of Ashoka the Great, the Mauryas maintained control over the Nalgonda region. Later, the Satavahanas, who ruled between 230 BC and 218 BC, took control of the area.

During this period, the region established trade contacts with the Roman Empire.

=== Ikshvakus (227 AD – 306 AD) ===
In 227 AD, the Ikshvaku dynasty took control of the region. During this period, members of various Saka tribes migrated to the area. Buddhism flourished during this time.

=== Invasion of Samudragupta ===
After the Ikshvakus, the Pallavas and Yadavas fought for supremacy over the region. However, after Samudragupta (c. 335 AD – c. 375 AD) invaded and conquered most of India, the area fell under the control of his Gupta Empire. The Empire fell in the 6th century.

=== The Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas ===
Starting in the 6th century, the Chalukya dynasty ruled the modern-day Nalgonda region, as well as much of southern and central India. A major portion of the Nalgonda area appears to have passed from the Chalukyas of Badami to the Rashtrakutas. However, the Rashtrakutas fell in 973, and power shifted to the Chalukyas of Kalyani. The Chalukyas continued to rule the area until the end of the 12th century.

=== Medieval period ===
During the medieval era, the Kakatiya dynasty took control of the region from the western Chalukyas. During the reign of Prataparudra II, in 1323, the kingdom was annexed to the Tughluq Empire.

When Muhammad bin Tughluq ruled (around 1324–1351), Musunuri chief Kapayanayaka ceded a part of Nalgonda to Ala-ud-din Hasan Bahman Shah of the Bahmani Sultanate. He annexed the region to the Bahmani Kingdom.

In 1455, Jalal Khan he declared himself king at Nalgonda, but this was short-lived. He was quickly defeated and the region brought back to the Bahmani Kingdom.

During the time of the Bahmani Sultan Shihabud-din Mahmun, Sultan Quli was appointed as tarafdar of the Telangana region (now the state of Telangana). Quli&#x27;s son, Jamshid, took control of the region from his father. Later, Qutub Shahis took control of the region, and maintained it until 1687.

=== Modern period: Mughals and Asaf Jahis ===
Nizam-ul-Mulk (Asaf Jah I) defeated Mubasiz Khan at Shaker Khere in Berar and ruled the Deccan autonomously. This district, like the other districts of Telangana, was controlled by Asaf Jahis, and remained under their rule for nearly two hundred and twenty-five years.

<doc id="978829" wikidata="Q44381" url="?curid=978829" title="Rabat, Malta">
<text>Rabat (, ) is a town in the Western Region of Malta, with a population of 11,497 as of March 2014. It adjoins the ancient capital city of Mdina, and a north-western area formed part of the Roman city of Melite until its medieval retrenchment. 

The Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See to the Republic of Malta is seated in this village. The Local Council of Rabat is also the administrator of Baħrija. Parts of the films &quot;Munich&quot; and &quot;Black Eagle&quot; were shot in Rabat. In December 1999, Mtarfa was split from Rabat to form a separate Local Council by Act XXI, an amendment to the Local Council Act of 1993 (Act XV). In 2021, Rabat was transferred from the Northern Region to the newly-created Western Region as part of a reorganization of the regions of Malta.

==Etymology==
Rabat is a Semitic word which can mean &quot;fortified town&quot; or &quot;suburb&quot;. The Arabic term Ribat refers to a small fortification to host military volunteers.

==Catacombs==
Rabat is home to the Catacombs of St. Paul and of St. Agatha. These catacombs were used in Roman times to bury the dead as, according to Roman culture, it was unhygienic to bury the dead in the city. Mdina and parts of Rabat were built on top of the ancient Roman city of Melite. The Maltese catacombs were never meant to be hiding places during persecutions or as living quarters.

The Catacombs of St. Paul are now administered by Heritage Malta. Part of St. Paul&#x27;s Catacombs, the part accessible from the Parish tradition and as recorded in the Bible, St. Paul stayed here for three months when he was shipwrecked on the island in AD 60. 

In the Catacombs of St Agatha&#x27;s, there are over 500 graves of several types, the majority being children&#x27;s graves. There are sections for pagans and Jews, as well as for Christians. There are also unique frescoes. Another feature of the Maltese catacombs is the agape table, two of which, carved out of bedrock, were found in the Catacombs of St. Paul.

<doc id="978840" wikidata="Q909476" url="?curid=978840" title="Cryostat">
<text>A cryostat (from &quot;cryo&quot; meaning cold and &quot;stat&quot; meaning stable) is a device used to maintain low cryogenic temperatures of samples or devices mounted within the cryostat. Low temperatures may be maintained within a cryostat by using various refrigeration methods, most commonly using cryogenic fluid bath such as liquid helium. Hence it is usually assembled into a vessel, similar in construction to a vacuum flask or Dewar. Cryostats have numerous applications within science, engineering, and medicine.

== Types ==
=== Closed-cycle cryostats ===
Closed-cycle cryostats consist of a chamber through which cold helium vapour is pumped. An external mechanical refrigerator extracts the warmer helium exhaust vapour, which is cooled and recycled. Closed-cycle cryostats consume a relatively large amount of electrical power, but need not be refilled with helium and can run continuously for an indefinite period. Objects may be cooled by attaching them to a metallic cold plate inside a vacuum chamber which is in thermal contact with the helium vapour chamber.

=== Continuous-flow cryostats ===
Continuous-flow cryostats are cooled by liquid cryogens (typically liquid helium or nitrogen) from a storage dewar. As the cryogen boils within the cryostat, it is continuously replenished by a steady flow from the storage dewar. Temperature control of the sample within the cryostat is typically performed by controlling the flow rate of cryogen into the cryostat together with a heating wire attached to a PID temperature control loop. The length of time over which cooling may be maintained is dictated by the volume of cryogens available.

Owing to the scarcity of liquid helium, some laboratories have facilities to capture and recover helium as it escapes from the cryostat, although these facilities are also costly to operate.

=== Bath cryostats ===
Bath cryostats are similar in construction to vacuum flasks filled with liquid helium. A cold plate is placed in thermal contact with the liquid helium bath. The liquid helium may be replenished as it boils away, at intervals between a few hours and several months, depending on the volume and construction of the cryostat. The boil-off rate is minimised by shielding the bath with either cold helium vapour, or vacuum shield with walls constructed from super insulator material. The helium vapour which boils away from the bath very effectively cools thermal shields around the outside of the bath. In the older designs there may be additional liquid nitrogen bath, or several concentric layers of shielding, with gradually increasing temperatures. However, the invention of super insulator materials has made this technology obsolete.

=== Multistage cryostats ===

In order to achieve temperatures lower than liquid helium at atmospheric pressure, additional cooler stages may be added to the cryostat. Temperatures down to 1 K can be reached by attaching the cold plate to a 1-K pot, which is a container of the He-4 isotope that may be pumped to low vapor pressure via a vacuum pump. Temperatures just below 0.300 K may be achieved using He-3, the rare isotope of helium, as the working fluid in a helium pot.
Temperatures down to 1 mK can be reached by employing dilution refrigerator or dry dilution refrigerator typically in addition to the main stage and 1 K pot. Temperatures below that can be reached using magnetic refrigeration.

== Applications ==

=== Magnetic resonance imaging and research magnet types ===
Cryostats used in MRI machines are designed to hold a cryogen, typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (boil-off). The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet&#x27;s bobbin of superconductive wire in its superconductive state. In this state, the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a &quot;quench&quot;, the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A burst disk, usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas and return it to the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.

Typically cryostats are manufactured with two vessels, one inside the other. The outer vessel is evacuated with the vacuum acting as a thermal insulator. The inner vessel contains the cryogen and is supported within the outer vessel by structures made from low-conductivity materials. An intermediate shield between the outer and inner vessels intercepts the heat radiated from the outer vessel. This heat is removed by a cryocooler. Older helium cryostats used a liquid nitrogen vessel as this radiation shield and had the liquid helium in an inner, third, vessel. Nowadays few units using multiple cryogens are made with the trend being towards &#x27;cryogen-free&#x27; cryostats in which all heat loads are removed by cryocoolers.

=== Biological microtome type ===

Cryostats are used in medicine to cut histological slides. They are usually used in a process called frozen section histology (see &quot;Frozen section procedure&quot;). The cryostat is essentially an ultrafine &quot;deli-slicer&quot;, called a microtome, placed in a freezer. The cryostat is usually a stationary upright freezer, with an external wheel for rotating the microtome. The temperature can be varied, depending on the tissue being cut usually from −20 °C to −30 °C. The freezer is either powered by electricity, or by a refrigerant like liquid nitrogen. Small portable cryostats are available and can run off generators or vehicle inverters. To minimize unnecessary warming all necessary mechanical movements of the microtome can be achieved by hand via a wheel mounted outside the chamber. Newer microtomes have electric push button advancement of the tissue. The precision of the cutting is in micrometres. Tissue are sectioned as thin as 1 micrometre. Usual histology slides are mounted with a thickness of about 7 micrometres. Specimens that are soft at room temperature are mounted on a cutting medium (often made of egg white) on a metal &quot;chuck&quot;, and frozen to cutting temperature (for example at −20 °C). Once frozen, the specimen on the chuck is mounted on the microtome. The crank is rotated and the specimen advances toward the cutting blade. Once the specimen is cut to a satisfactory quality, it is mounted on a warm (room temperature) clear glass slide, where it will instantaneously melt and adhere. The glass slide and specimen is dried with a dryer or air dried, and stained. The entire process from mounting to reading the slide takes from 10 to 20 minutes, allowing rapid diagnosis in the operating room, for the surgical excision of cancer. The cryostat can be used to cut histology and tissue slide (e.g., for enzyme localization) outside of medicine, but the quality of the section is poor compared to standard fixed section wax mounted histology.

<text>Adil Çarçani (5 May 1922 – 13 October 1997) was an Albanian politician who served as the 24th Prime Minister of Albania during the Communist era led by Enver Hoxha. He served as the titular head of the Albanian government in the years immediately preceding the fall of Communism.

==Biography==
Çarçani was born on May 5, 1922, in the village of Fushëbardhë, near Gjirokastër. During World War II, he fought for Partisan forces against the Italian fascists, and joined the Communist Party and the government that it set up after the war. He became mining minister in the 1950s, joined the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania in the 1960s, and by 1981 had become First Deputy Prime Minister.

On December 18, 1981, immediately after the violent death of Mehmet Shehu, Çarçani became the 24th Prime Minister of Albania. He remained in that position until February 1991, two months after Communism started falling in Albania, when he resigned after mobs tore down the statue of Enver Hoxha, the founder and leader of Communist Albania from 1946 to 1985. Çarçani was, however, elected to parliament that year, and gave the opening speech.

== Post-1991 ==
On 21 May 1994, Çarçani was tried for and abuse of power, alongside Ramiz Alia. He was tried, found guilty and sentenced to prison. His sentence was commuted to five years of house arrest, however, as he was beginning to suffer from health problems. He died under house arrest in Tirana.

<doc id="978854" wikidata="Q185222" url="?curid=978854" title="Cape Bojador">
<text>Cape Bojador (, trans. &quot;Rā&#x27;s Būjādūr&quot;; , &quot;Bujdur&quot;; Spanish and ; ) is a headland on the west coast of Western Sahara, at 26° 07&#x27; 37&quot;N, 14° 29&#x27; 57&quot;W (various sources give various locations: this is from the &quot;Sailing Directions&quot; for the region), as well as the name of the large nearby town with a population of 42,651. The name of the surrounding province also derives its name from the cape (Bojador Province).

The original name of the cape in Arabic is Abu Khaṭar (ابو خطر), meaning &quot;father of danger&quot;. The Spanish pronunciation of &quot;Bojador&quot;, /boxad̪or/, is similar.
It is shown on nautical charts, media and academic research with the original Portuguese name &quot;Cabo Bojador&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;Cape Boujdour&quot;. It is said that it is also known as the &quot;Bulging Cape&quot;, although no references to this usage are to be found in standard geographical references.

The cape is not prominent on maps but may be located by looking 220 km (120 nautical miles) due south of the south-western point of the hook of Fuerteventura, Canary Islands.

==Historical significance==
The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador, in 1434, by the Portuguese mariner Gil Eanes was considered a major breakthrough for European explorers and traders en route to Africa and later to India. Eanes had made a previous attempt in 1433 which resulted in failure, but he tried again under orders of Prince Henry the Navigator. Eanes was successful after the second expedition.
The disappearance of numerous European vessels that had made prior attempts to round the Cape despite its violent seas, led some to suggest the presence of sea monsters. The mythic importance of the cape for Portugal was captured in Fernando Pessoa&#x27;s early 20th century work &quot;Mensagem&quot;. In famous stanzas from this longer poem Pessoa wrote of the enormous costs of the Portuguese explorations to the nation. Capturing the symbolic importance to the nation of rounding Cape Bojador, Pessoa wrote: &quot;Who wants to pass beyond Bojador / Must also pass beyond pain.&quot; (&quot;Quem quer passar além do Bojador / Tem que passar além da dor.&quot;) They thought the ocean was burning past Cape Bojador, but Henry&#x27;s men went past it.

The reason for the fearsome reputation of the cape is not immediately obvious from maps, where it appears as the south-western point of a slight hump in the coastline, bounded at its other end by Cabo Falso Bojador, ten nautical miles to the northeast. Nor does what is said in the &quot;Sailing Directions&quot; sound terribly formidable: 
Examining the &quot;Pilot Charts&quot; for this area, however, it becomes clear that the main concern lies in the changes in winds that occur at about the point at which Cape Bojador is passed in sailing down the coast. It is here that the winds start to blow strongly from the northeast at all seasons. Together with the half-knot set of current down the coast, these conditions would naturally alarm a medieval mariner used to sailing close to the land and having no knowledge of what lay ahead. In the end it was discovered that by sailing well out to sea—far out of sight of land—a more favorable wind could be picked up.

In addition, this is also believed to be the site where Captain James Riley and the crew of the U.S. brig , sailing at the time from Gibraltar towards the Cape Verde Islands, shipwrecked in August 1815. This tragedy is recounted in the &quot;Skeletons on the Zahara&quot;, by Dean King, which is set in this region of the African coast. King reports that any coastal map of Western Sahara is inaccurate because of the ever-changing physical features, due to the harsh conditions of the Sahara. It also mentions that the depth of the water surrounding Cape Bojador is deceptively shallow, and the color of the sand underneath the water is a &quot;fearful sight&quot;. The cape had a fearsome reputation among mariners even prior to the wreck of the &quot;Commerce&quot;, as there had been at least thirty known shipwrecks between 1790 and 1806.

Sailors&#x27; fears were founded in what they saw, and the phenomena witnessed by the sailors of those days can be seen today. Any ship that has to pass those places makes sure to give a wide berth in order to avoid accidents. The reason for all this display is because Cape Bojador and its surrounding coast extends into the sea in the form of an underwater reef, and, when the waves break after crashing into unseen gullies, the water spouts furiously into high foamy clouds that look like steam, even on calm days. The sea in front to the Cape, and for approximately three miles from the coast and into the sea, is no more than six feet deep. Fish are abundant in the place, and shoals of sardines rise to the surface during the feeding times of larger fish. When this happens, the sea seems to bubble violently as if boiling, and, observed from a distance, the hissing sound produced by the fish flicking their tails on the water&#x27;s surface adds to the impression that the water is boiling. The tremendous heat wafted westerly on lazy breezes from the desert heightens the impression of extreme temperature, to which the desert dust helps to create a mysterious darkness. Even the ferrous rocks make compass needles whirl erratically. 

As recently as 2004, the British Royal Navy&#x27;s publication &quot;Africa Pilot&quot; warns that nautical charts of the coastline in the area of Cape Bojador are &quot;reported to be inaccurate&quot;.

==Ecological significance==
The Spanish interest in the desert coast of Western Africa was the result of fishing activities carried out from the Canary Islands by Spanish fishermen.

Spanish fishers were seal fur traders and hunters, fishers and whalers off the Sahara coast with several enclaves in Cabo Bojador, Dakhla and Ras Nouadhibou from 1500 to present, extending from the west coast of Africa to hunting humpback whales and whale calves, mostly in Cape Verde, and the Gulf of Guinea in Annobón, São Tomé and Príncipe islands just to 1940. These fishing activities have had a negative impact on wildlife causing the disappearance or endangerment of many species, particularly marine mammals and birds. The former range of the Mediterranean monk seal (&quot;Monachus monachus&quot;) extended throughout the Northwest Atlantic coast of Africa and the Mediterranean and Black Sea coastlines, including all offshore islands of the Mediterranean, and into the Atlantic and its islands: Canary Islands, Madeira, Ilhas Desertas, Porto Santo, and others as far west as the Azores. Vagrants could be found as far south as Gambia and the Cape Verde islands, and as far north as continental Portugal and Atlantic France.

==In modern times==
The Spanish originally claimed the land from 20° 51&#x27; N (near Cap Blanc) to 26° 8&#x27; N (near Cape Bojador) in 1885. This would be a protectorate governed from the Canary Islands in 1887. France would later claim the Western Sahara. The boundary was settled in a joint French-Spanish convention in 1900 to divide the area between Spanish Sahara and French West Africa.

Spain claimed a protectorate over the coastal region from Cap Blanc, far to the south of Cape Bojador, to a point about 200 km to the north in 1884. In 1975, as Spain pulled out following the Madrid Accords, Morocco sought to gain control over the area, leading to disputes between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the organization which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in February 1976. In January 2016 it was announced that the Canary Association of Victims of Terrorism (ACAVITE) intended to sue the Polisario Front for committing &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;.

In the Tindouf region of Algeria, Daira de Bojador is a refugee camp for Sahrawis named after Cape Bojador.

In December 2015, the bodies of 11 drowned migrants were found 147 kilometers off Cape Bojador. Earlier that same month, the Spanish coastguard rescued 47 African migrants in a boat off the coast of Gran Canaria.

<text>Donald Leslie Chipp, AO (21 August 1925 – 28 August 2006) was an Australian politician who was the inaugural leader of the Australian Democrats, leading the party from 1977 to 1986. He began his career as a member of the Liberal Party, winning election to the House of Representatives in 1960 and serving as a government minister for a cumulative total of six years. Chipp left the Liberals in 1977 and was soon persuaded to lead a new party, the Democrats who, he famously proclaimed in 1980, would &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. He was elected to the Senate on 10 December 1977 and led the party at four federal elections. From 1983 it held the sole balance of power in the Senate.

==Early life==
Don Chipp was born in Melbourne and educated at Northcote Primary School, Northcote High School and the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in commerce. After playing Australian rules football for Heidelberg, he played briefly in the Victorian Football League with the Fitzroy Football Club (playing three games in 1947, for one goal). He also played for Prahran in the VFA and was a member of their 1951 premiership side. A champion sprinter, he was narrowly defeated in the 1953 Stawell Gift foot race.

After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II, Chipp worked as registrar of the Commonwealth Institute of Accountants from 1950 to 1955. In 1955, he was appointed chief executive officer of the Olympic Civic Committee which was involved in organising the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Later, he worked as manager of the Victorian Promotion Committee, and he also ran his own management consultancy. From 1958 to 1961, he was a member of the Kew City Council.

==Early parliamentary career==

Chipp entered federal politics in 1960 as the Liberal member for Higinbotham in Melbourne&#x27;s southern bayside suburbs. Higinbotham was abolished in 1969, and Chipp followed most of his constituents into the new seat of Hotham. He was given the Navy and Tourism portfolios by Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967. After Holt&#x27;s sudden disappearance in December 1967, Chipp retained those portfolios in the brief interim government of Country Party leader John McEwen, but he was dropped from the ministry by the new Liberal Prime Minister, John Gorton. That was partly because Chipp had supported another candidate, Billy Snedden, in the Liberal leadership ballot and partly because Chipp did not support a second Royal Commission into the 1964 &quot;Voyager&quot; disaster, which Gorton felt reflected badly on the Royal Australian Navy.

After the 1969 election, Gorton appointed Chipp as Minister for Customs and Excise. In that portfolio, he gained national attention by largely abolishing the censorship of printed material, unbanning many novels, including Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, as well as allowing the sale of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. He also oversaw the introduction of the R certificate for films in 1970, which allowed previously banned films to be rerated and shown to adults. The actions made him widely popular but were disapproved of by more conservative Liberal Party colleagues who identified him as a &quot;small-l liberal&quot;, along with Snedden and Andrew Peacock.

Following the Liberal Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1972 election by the Labor Party&#x27;s Gough Whitlam, Chipp served as Shadow Minister for Social Security. He was a strong supporter of Snedden, who had become party leader following the 1972 defeat but lost the 1974 election against Whitlam. When Malcolm Fraser displaced Snedden as leader in March 1975, Chipp retained his position, but it was no secret that the two men did not get on. When Fraser was appointed prime minister following the dismissal of Gough Whitlam on 11 November 1975, he gave Chipp three portfolios in his caretaker ministry: Social Security, Health, and Repatriation and Compensation. However, when Fraser won the election the next month, Chipp was not included in the ministry.

==Resignation from Liberal Party==
In his book &quot;The Third Man&quot;, Chipp considered the effects of a &quot;whispering campaign&quot; to discredit him within the Liberal Party. That came to a head on 8 March 1977 when he spoke at a heavily attended &quot;Citizens for Democracy&quot; meeting at the Sydney Town Hall with other controversial speakers including Frank Hardy, Patrick White, Donald Horne and Faith Bandler. He writes &quot;Liberals thought it was intolerable that any member of the party should appear with &#x27;those people&#x27;&quot;. Chipp concluded: &quot;It was then, I believe, that I concluded I could not stay in such a party any longer. I resented the tag of &#x27;rebel&#x27; which was being applied to me by my own colleagues.&quot; The rebellious image was heightened by the fact that Chipp omitted to attend a Parliament House reception for Queen Elizabeth II. He had decided to honour his prior speaking engagement, which had been widely publicised. The meeting, attended by 5,000, &quot;almost went out of control when I stated that Sir John Kerr had no alternative than to act as he did on 11 November 1975. Donald Horne pleaded for order, saying &quot;This man deserves a hearing; he is putting his political career on the line by speaking here.&quot;

Chipp decided to resign from the Liberal Party on 24 March 1977 and concluded his speech that day with the following: I have become disenchanted with party politics as they are practised in this country and with the pressure groups which have an undue influence on the major political parties. The parties seem to polarise on almost every issue, sometimes seemingly just for the sake of it, and I wonder if the ordinary voter is not becoming sick and tired of the vested interests which unduly influence political parties and yearns for the emergence of a third political force, representing middle-of-the-road policies which would owe allegiance to no outside pressure group. Perhaps it may be the right time to test that proposition. 

==Leadership of Democrats==

Even before the resignation, he received an invitation to join the amalgamated Centre-Line Party, which predated the Australian Democrats. He resolutely turned down a series of such leadership offers until, on 9 May 1977, he was accorded an overwhelming standing ovation by a 3,000-strong audience at the Melbourne Town Hall. The meeting was attended by former prime minister John Gorton and chaired by South Australian Governor Sir Mark Oliphant. Speakers included Robin Millhouse, Charles Birch and John Siddons. Chipp concluded, &quot;... I was committed ... and it was a good feeling”.

At the December 1977 election, Chipp was elected to the Australian Senate as a Democrats candidate, with one colleague (Colin Mason of New South Wales). As Democrats leader, Chipp was involved in various high-profile environmental and social-justice causes, including playing an important role in stopping the Franklin Dam project.

At the 1980 election, the Democrats gained three more senators, giving them a total of five. They held a potential balance of power, which they retained for most of the time until 1 July 2005, after a total lack of success at the 2004 election. Their theoretical ability to reject or amend government legislation was seldom applied, as it was dependent on rare support from other non-government senators. It was, however, a useful avenue for publicity and effective Senate committee dealings outside the chamber.

==Later life==
Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator by Janet Powell.

From 1988 to 1990, Chipp conducted a regular talkback program on Melbourne radio station 3AK.

He ran unsuccessfully for election as the Lord Mayor of Melbourne in 2001. In his later years, he suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but he still made a number of public appearances, most notably on the ABC chat show &quot;Enough Rope&quot; with Andrew Denton. He also gave an opening address to the Democrats&#x27; national conference in Melbourne in May 2006.

Chipp died of pneumonia in August 2006 at Epworth Hospital in Melbourne. A state funeral service was held on 2 September 2006 for him. Australian flags were flown at half-mast all day in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory in his honour.

==Personal life==

Chipp was married twice.

On 27 October 1951 he married Monica Lalor. With her support, Chipp stood and won a seat on the Kew City Council which he held from 1955 to 1961, and was encouraged- at that time – to become an active member of the Liberal Party. They had four children.

Chipp and Lalor divorced in 1979, and Chipp married Idun Welz later that same year. They had two children.

His eldest son, Greg Chipp, established Drug Law Reform Australia, a political party focused on the decriminalisation of illegal drugs, and contested the 2013 and 2016 federal elections. Don Chipp&#x27;s youngest daughter, Laura Chipp, contested the 2017 by-election in the Victorian electorate of Northcote, representing the Reason Party (formerly known as the Australian Sex Party).

<text>&quot;You Really Got Me&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Kinks, written by frontman Ray Davies. The song, originally performed in a more blues-oriented style, was inspired by artists such as Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. Two versions were recorded, with the second performance used for the final single. Lead guitarist Dave Davies performs the song&#x27;s famous guitar solo. Although it was long rumoured that future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page had performed the song&#x27;s guitar solo, this has been debunked by Page himself.

&quot;You Really Got Me&quot; is built around power chords (perfect fifths and octaves) and it heavily influenced later rock musicians, particularly in the heavy metal and punk rock genres. Built around a guitar riff played by Dave Davies, its lyrics were described by Dave as &quot;a love song for street kids&quot;.

The song was released in the UK on 4 August 1964 by Pye Records as the group&#x27;s third single, and reached number one on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart the following month, remaining there for two weeks. It was released in the US on 2 September by Reprise Records. The song became the group&#x27;s breakthrough hit. It established them as one of the top British Invasion acts in the United States, reaching number seven later in the year. &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was later included on the Kinks&#x27; debut album, &quot;Kinks&quot;. American rock band Van Halen covered the song in their 1978 eponymous debut album; it was released as their first single and peaked at No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Background==
&quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was written by Ray Davies, the Kinks&#x27; vocalist and main songwriter, sometime between 9 and 12 March 1964. Created on the piano in the front room of the Davies&#x27; home, the song was stylistically very different from the finished product, being much lighter and somewhat jazz-oriented. Ray said of the song&#x27;s writing, &quot;When I came up with [&#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27;] I hadn&#x27;t been writing songs very long at all. It was one of the first five I ever came up with.&quot;

Davies said that he had been inspired to write the song one night during his college days playing with the Dave Hunt Band, when he saw an attractive girl on the dance floor. He said: &quot;When we finished, I went off to find her, but she was gone and never returned to the club. She really got me going.&quot;

During the spring of 1964, Ray Davies played an early version of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; on the piano to rock photographer Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, &quot;It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray sat down and plonked out, &#x27;Der-der, der, Der-der!&#x27; He said, &#x27;What do you reckon to this?&#x27; It meant nothing to me at the time, but it ended up as &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27;.&quot;

Ray, initially planning for the song to be a &quot;more laid-back number&quot;, later played the chords of the song to brother Dave Davies, the Kinks&#x27; lead guitarist. However, upon hearing the track, Dave decided that the riff would be much more powerful on a guitar. Ray said of the track&#x27;s change to a guitar-centred track, &quot;I wanted it to be a jazz-type tune, because that&#x27;s what I liked at the time. It&#x27;s written originally around a sax line ... Dave ended up playing the sax line in fuzz guitar and it took the song a step further.&quot; The band began performing the new track in some of their live shows, where it was well received.

In 1998, Ray said, &quot;I&#x27;d written &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27; as tribute to all those great blues people I love: Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy.&quot; Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, &quot;Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in [the &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; movie], and as he sat at the piano at home, he sort of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan and came up with this figure based on a 12-bar blues&quot;. Dave has also said that song had been inspired by Jimmy Giuffre&#x27;s song &quot;The Train and the River&quot;. According to the band&#x27;s manager, Larry Page, the song&#x27;s characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen&#x27;s &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band&#x27;s &quot;first serious female fans&quot;.

==Recording==
The Kinks recorded &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; at least twice in mid-1964, likely around June 14 and July 12. The band&#x27;s demo was in a &quot;bluesy&quot; style, while a full studio version recorded in June was slower and less emphatic than the final single. Shel Talmy had, according to Davies, covered the track in reverb, all but burying the lead guitar. The band wanted to rerecord the song, but their record company Pye refused to fund another session on the grounds that the band&#x27;s first two singles had failed to chart. Ray Davies, however, threatened that he would refuse to perform or promote the single unless it was re-recorded. Manager Larry Page also refused to publish the original recording. When Pye stood its ground, the band&#x27;s own management broke the stalemate by funding the session themselves. Ray Davies&#x27; adamant attitude on behalf of the career-making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks. Davies later said, &quot;I was floundering around trying to find an identity. It was in 1964 that I managed to do that, to be able to justify myself and say, &#x27;I exist, I&#x27;m here.&#x27; I was literally born when that song hit.&quot;

The influential distortion sound of the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called &quot;little green&quot;, after the name of the amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies&#x27; neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave&#x27;s guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, &quot;My brother is lying. I don&#x27;t know why he does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the speaker cone up with a razor blade and I was so shocked and surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [Kinks bassist] Pete [Quaife]... Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27; and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound.&quot;

According to recent Kinks&#x27; releases that give full official performance credits of the track, group members Ray Davies (vocals and rhythm guitar), Dave Davies (lead guitar), Pete Quaife (bass) are joined by session men Bobby Graham (drums), and Arthur Greenslade (piano). Regular Kinks drummer Mick Avory plays the tambourine.

==Guitar solo==
The guitar solo on the recording has been the subject of the persistent myth that it was not played by the Kinks&#x27; lead guitarist Dave Davies, but by then-session player Jimmy Page, who later joined the Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. Among those claiming Page played lead guitar was Jon Lord of Deep Purple, who also claimed to play piano on the track. Page has always denied playing the song&#x27;s guitar solo, going so far as to say in a 1970s interview cited in &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine, &quot;I didn&#x27;t play on &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27; and that&#x27;s what pisses him [Ray Davies] off.&quot; Rock historian and author Doug Hinman makes a case that the rumour was begun and fostered by the established British rhythm and blues community, many of whose members were resentful that an upstart band of teenagers such as the Kinks could produce such a powerful and influential blues-based recording seemingly out of nowhere.

Shel Talmy, the producer on the track, put the controversy to rest in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, saying, &quot;contrary to myth, Jimmy didn&#x27;t play on &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27;.&quot; In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall&quot; series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying &quot;Oh, Crikey! I wasn&#x27;t on &#x27;You Really Got Me,&#x27; but I did play on the Kinks&#x27; records. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about &#x27;You Really Got Me.&#x27; So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won&#x27;t keep asking me.&quot; Drummer Mick Avory also confirmed that the guitar solo was played by Dave Davies and not Jimmy Page in an interview with AllMusic in 2023.

In his 1998 autobiographical release &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, Ray Davies discusses the guitar solo. He confirms that his brother Dave played the solo and it was preceded by some bantering between the two:
==Music and lyrics==

Commentators have described &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; as garage rock, hard rock, rock and roll, and proto-punk. While Ray Davies had been instructed at the time to write &quot;Beatle-type&quot; material for commercial reasons, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was written as a more R&amp;B-based composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff that has been called &quot;instantly identifiable&quot;. American musicologist Robert Walser described &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; as &quot;the first hit song built around power chords.&quot;

The song has been labeled an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, You Really Got Me&#x27; remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal.&quot; Dave Davies has rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the sound—if you played it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful.&quot;

The lyrics of the song are about lust and sex. Dave Davies said of the song&#x27;s lyrics, You Really Got Me&#x27; [is] such a pure record, really. It&#x27;s a love song for street kids. They&#x27;re not going to wine and dine you, even if they knew how to chat you up. [They say] &#x27;I want you—come here.

==Release and reception==
&quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s third single on 4 August 1964, backed with &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot; (also spelled &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;). Within three days of the single&#x27;s release, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; began to appear on local charts. Eventually, the song climbed to the top of the British charts, the band&#x27;s first single to do so. Ray Davies later claimed that, due to the single&#x27;s high demand, Pye Records put all their other records on hold to solely produce copies of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. Due to the high level of success the single achieved in the UK, a rush-release of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was put out in the US on 2 September 1964, despite being delayed from its initial release date of 26 August. Although it did not enter the charts until 26 September, the record rose to number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The song later appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Kinks&quot;, with the title of the American release of the album changed to &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. Plans for Ray to sing versions of the song in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese for their respective markets were proposed by Shel Talmy but never materialised. The single B-side, &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, was included on the UK EP &quot;Kinksize Hits&quot; (1964). It was first issued on an album in the US, where it was included on the Kinks&#x27; third album &quot;Kinkdom&quot; (1965). Music writers have called the song &quot;shockingly different&quot; from the Kinks&#x27; recorded work up to this point, and a &quot;frenetic lost gem&quot;. The song is included on a 1998 CD reissue of the group&#x27;s debut album.

Upon release, the single received a positive review from &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, which said, &quot;Highly promising group with strong guitar sound and a compact sort of vocal performance. Mid-tempo but bustling song should sell well.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, singer Dave Berry was featured in a blindfold test of the song, with Berry at first guessing the song was by the Kingsmen. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s fabulous, this one. I like these records that sound as if they&#x27;ve gone into a recording studio and done what they wanted to on the spot. It&#x27;s a good chance of being a big hit.&quot; The &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review had a lasting impact on Ray Davies, who said that Berry &quot;had a few hits—so he mattered&quot; and that Berry&#x27;s belief that the band had &quot;done what they wanted&quot; had &quot;said it all&quot; for him. In the U.S., &quot;Cash Box&quot; called the single &quot;a pulsating, blues-flavored rock-a-rhythmic...that builds along the way.&quot;

The Kinks&#x27; use of distorted guitar riffs continued with songs like &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;, and &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, among others. Pete Townshend of the Who, a band also produced by Talmy at that time, has stated that their first single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;, was influenced by the Kinks&#x27; work at the time. Other artists influenced by &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; include Tom Petty, John Lydon, Joe Jackson, Chris Bell of Big Star, and Jimi Hendrix, who, according to Dave Davies, described the song as &quot;a landmark record&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine placed the song at number 82 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time and at number four on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. In early 2005, the song was voted the best British song of the 1955–1965 decade in a BBC radio poll. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed it at number nine in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2009, it was named the 57th Greatest Hard Rock Song by VH1.

==Live history==
Before its release, the Kinks performed &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; in some of their early concerts. It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming to feel a connection with the crowd as he performed the song. Ray later said, &quot;Our success came from playing [the song] live. When we played &#x27;You Really Got Me&#x27; people actually took notice. They realised we had something original.&quot;

The Kinks continued to perform successfully for over 30 years through many musical styles, but &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; remained a mainstay in concert. During some shows, the song was played in a medley with its follow-up single &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, while in 1977, a performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a four-song medley of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;, &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;, and &quot;Lola&quot;. In a live performance on the &quot;Don Lane Show&quot; in 1982, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was featured in a medley with the band&#x27;s 1981 song, &quot;Destroyer&quot;. In 1984, Dave Davies claimed that, even after twenty years of performing &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, the track was &quot;still fun to play live.&quot;

A live version of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s 1980 live album, &quot;One for the Road&quot;. This version, following the minor success of the same album&#x27;s live version of &quot;Lola&quot;, was released as a single in America, backed with the live take of &quot;Low Budget&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Attitude&quot;. It failed to chart. This version was later included on the 1986 compilation album &quot;Come Dancing with the Kinks: The Best of the Kinks 1977–1986&quot;.

Other live renditions of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; have also been released. A version on &quot;Live at Kelvin Hall&quot; recorded at Kelvin Hall in Glasgow, Scotland, was released in 1967, while a performance at the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, appeared on 1994&#x27;s &quot;To the Bone&quot;. The Davies brothers also performed a live version in Boston, Massachusetts with the Smithereens in November 1991, which later appeared on the latter band&#x27;s 1995 compilation album &quot;Attack of the Smithereens&quot;. Ray and Dave Davies still perform the song in solo shows, generally as a closing number.

In December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave onstage at one of his concerts to perform &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. The event marked the first time the brothers performed on stage together in nearly 20 years, sparking rumours of a Kinks reunion.

==Van Halen version==
The American hard rock band Van Halen released a cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; on its self-titled 1978 debut album. As the band&#x27;s first single, it was a popular radio hit that helped jump-start the band&#x27;s career, as it had done for the Kinks 14 years earlier. This version, which Eddie Van Halen called an &quot;updated&quot; version of the original, featured &quot;histrionic&quot; guitar playing by himself and &quot;vocal shenanigans&quot; by David Lee Roth. The song had been played by the band live for years before its studio release. On the radio, it is often featured with &quot;Eruption&quot;, the instrumental that precedes it on the album, as an intro.

The song was released as a single as a result of an encounter between Van Halen and members of the band Angel. Van Halen and Angel drummer Barry Brandt had both been bragging about their new material to one another, resulting in Van Halen showing Brandt a demo of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. The next day, the band&#x27;s producer, Ted Templeman, told Van Halen that Angel was recording its own cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; to release before Van Halen&#x27;s version. As a result, the song was rush-released as a single before Angel could do so.

&quot;Record World&quot; said that it&#x27;s a &quot;supercharged, heavier version&quot; than the Kinks&#x27; version and that &quot;it&#x27;s still a fine, primal rocker.&quot;

Eddie Van Halen later expressed dissatisfaction with the use of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; as the band&#x27;s debut single. He said, &quot;It kind of bummed me out that Ted [Templeman] wanted our first single to be someone else&#x27;s tune. I would have maybe picked &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Cryin&#x27;, just because it was our own.&quot;

The Kinks&#x27; Dave Davies has claimed to dislike Van Halen&#x27;s rendition of the song, saying &quot;There&#x27;s the thing: good art isn&#x27;t always about having the comfiest technique. I shouldn&#x27;t encourage him, but I&#x27;m sure Eddie Van Halen played better when he was drunk.&quot; He also told of how a concert-goer approached him after a live show and congratulated him on performing a &quot;great cover of the Van Halen song&quot;. Ray Davies, on the other hand, claimed to like the track because it made him laugh.

<text>Blackie and the Rodeo Kings are a Canadian folk rock–alternative country band with blues and country influences. The band was formed in 1996, in Hamilton, Ontario, by Tom Wilson, Stephen Fearing, and Colin Linden.

== Career ==
=== Early Period: 1990s ===
Tom Wilson (former lead singer of Junkhouse and Tom Wilson &amp; the Florida Razors), solo artist Stephen Fearing, and guitarist and producer Colin Linden started Blackie and the Rodeo Kings as a tribute to one of their favorite Canadian folk artists, the singer-songwriter Willie P. Bennett. Their name was taken from Bennett&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Blackie and the Rodeo King&quot;. What started as a side project soon turned into a full-fledged band after their first album, &quot;High or Hurtin&#x27;: The Songs of Willie P. Bennett&quot;, was a critical success and popular with fans of both Bennett and each individual artist. Blackie and the Rodeo Kings have released numerous full-length studio albums and received many awards and nominations. In 1999, the band recorded &quot;Kings of Love&quot;, which received a Juno Award for Best Roots &amp; Traditional Album – Group in 2000.

The band originally performed at such venues as the Black Sheep Inn in Wakefield, Quebec.

=== 2000s ===
In 2003, the band recorded &quot;Bark&quot;. &quot;Kings of Love&quot; and &quot;Bark&quot; still had cover versions of Bennett&#x27;s songs, but they also included some original material by the band members and cover versions of songs by Bruce Cockburn, Fred Eaglesmith and David Wiffen. In 2005, the band was included in a list published by the &quot;New York Times&quot; of songs found on President George W. Bush&#x27;s iPod. In 2006, the band recorded &quot;Let&#x27;s Frolic!&quot;, consisting of all-original material.

In 2008, the band were the winners of the 7th annual Independent Music Awards Vox Pop vote for best band venue poster. It was designed by Michael Wrycraft.

In 2009, the compilation album &quot;Swinging from the Chains of Love&quot; was released, which included the previously unreleased &quot;Caves of Jericho&quot; and a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;.

For their 2011 album &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; the band teamed up with singers Emmylou Harris, Pam Tillis, Lucinda Williams, Rosanne Cash, Cassandra Wilson, Serena Ryder and Patti Scialfa. Each of the 14 tracks featured a duet with one of the singers. The band then went out on tour in support of the album. In 2012 they performed at the Calgary Folk Music Festival.

In 2014, the band released the album &quot;South&quot;, which was made up of new, original songs, as well a cover of Willie P. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Driftin&#x27; Snow.&quot;

Their 2017 album &quot;Kings and Kings&quot; revisited the format of their 2011 album &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;, this time pairing the band with different guest male vocalists. Contributing to the album were Eric Church, City and Colour, Bruce Cockburn, Rodney Crowell, Vince Gill, Jason Isbell, Nick Lowe, Raul Malo (of The Mavericks), The Men of Nashville, Buddy Miller, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, and Fantastic Negrito.

Richard Bell (March5, 1946, TorontoJune15, 2007, Toronto): Pianist for Janis Joplin and The Band. He was the keyboardist for Blackie and the Rodeo Kings for a number of years before his death.

Janice Powers has handled occasional keyboard duties as well as various production assistance roles on several albums, and the band has recorded several of her songs. She is also the spouse of Colin Linden.

<text>Thomas Lazare Wilson (born 1959) is a Canadian rock musician from Hamilton, Ontario. A veteran of the Canadian music scene, Wilson has been a writer and performer for many years. Wilson&#x27;s eclectic musical style has ranged from the psychobilly/R&amp;B sounds of the Florida Razors, to the western/roots style of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings and the funk/blues-inspired rock of Junkhouse.

==Early life==
Wilson grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, secretly adopted and raised by his great-aunt and uncle. Later in life Tom discovered his birth parents, Louis Beauvais and Jane Lazare, both Mohawk from Kahnawake. Tom did not confirm his Mohawk identity until he was an adult. Wilson discovered the truth about his adoption by chance: a speaking tour handler who had been an old friend of his great-aunt mentioned she had been there the day he was adopted.

==Career==
Tom Wilson&#x27;s first performing band was The Florida Razors, formed in 1981 with guitarist Jason Avery, guitarist Bruce Cameron, bassist Steven Toth and drummer Greg Cannon. Steven Toth and Bruce Cameron left the band in 1982 and Carl Keesee joined on bass. They released one full-length album, &quot;Beat Music&quot;, in 1986 but dissolved in 1987.

In the 1990s, Wilson fronted the band Junkhouse. Junkhouse released three studio albums and a number of singles.

In 1996, he joined with Colin Linden, Stephen Fearing to form the roots rock trio Blackie and the Rodeo Kings.

In 1999, Wilson performed solo as part of The White Ribbon Concert at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto.

In 2001, Wilson released a solo album, &quot;Planet Love&quot;. The album featured the single &quot;Dig It&quot;, which reached #11 on Canada&#x27;s Rock chart. In 2006 he released his second solo album, &quot;Dog Years&quot;. In between the release of both solo albums, he partnered up with Daniel Lanois&#x27;s older brother, Bob Lanois, to record &quot;The Shack Recordings Volume 1&quot;, a collection of quieter acoustic songs with Bob Lanois recording and accompanying him on blues harp on some songs.

It was around this time Wilson and comedian Cathy Jones met and became engaged. They split their time between Hamilton and Nova Scotia, though they never married.

In 2011, he toured with Blackie and the Rodeo Kings in support of their album &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;. That year he performed at the Winnipeg Folk Festival.

In 2015, Wilson was commissioned by the city of Hamilton to paint a mural depicting the history of music in the city.

Wilson&#x27;s most recent project is Lee Harvey Osmond, which is a collaborative effort with members of Cowboy Junkies and Skydiggers.

His songs have been performed by Mavis Staples, Colin James, Stephen Fearing, Adam Gregory, Billy Ray Cyrus, Craig Northey, David Ricketts and Edwin. Numerous Wilson songs have been used in television, commercials and motion pictures.

In 2017, Wilson published a memoir of his life to date, titled &quot;Beautiful Scars&quot;. The memoir addressed his discovery of his Mohawk heritage, which he also addressed musically for the first time on Lee Harvey Osmond&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Mohawk&quot;. In 2022 he released &quot;Mother Love&quot;, a collaborative album with iskwē.

He was the subject of Shane Belcourt&#x27;s 2022 documentary film &quot;Beautiful Scars&quot;, which premiered at the 2022 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.

Wilson was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada in June 2023, with this citation: &quot;For his multifaceted contributions to the arts in Canada, notably as an iconic musician, as well as for his advocacy of Indigenous communities in Canada.&quot;

In 2024 McMaster University announced that Wilson will be awarded an honorary degree.

== Personal life ==

In the mid-1980s, Wilson met Sandy Shaw while performing in a Kingston, Ontario bar. They began a relationship and, in 1989, moved to Hamilton. The couple married in 1995 after having two children. The couple divorced in the early 2000s, though remained close, with Wilson performing at a campaign fundraiser for Shaw when she ran for municipal office in Hamilton in 2014.

In 2006, Wilson was engaged to comedian Cathy Jones. However, they were never married.

Wilson&#x27;s son, Thompson Wilson Shaw, is also a musician, formerly part of the folk-rock group Harlan Pepper. They would occasionally tour together, and Harlan Pepper opened for Blackie and the Rodeo Kings on some of their concerts. Wilson&#x27;s daughter, Madeline Wilson Shaw, worked as a music promoter and political staffer with the Ontario NDP.

Since 2015, Wilson has been in a relationship with Margot Burnell.

<text>The Bank of New South Wales (BNSW), also known as The Wales, was the first bank in Australia. It was established in 1817 in Sydney. During the 19th century, the bank opened branches throughout Australia and New Zealand, expanding into Oceania in the 20th century. Throughout it history it merged with and purchased many other financial institutions. In 1981 it merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia and was renamed Westpac on 4 May 1982.

==History==
Established in 1817 in Macquarie Place, Sydney premises leased from Mary Reibey, the Bank of New South Wales (BNSW) was the first bank in Australia. It was established under the economic regime of Governor Lachlan Macquarie (responsible for transitioning the penal settlement of Sydney into a capitalist economy). At the time, the colony of Sydney had not been supplied with currency, instead barter and promissory notes was the payment method of choice. Governor Macquarie himself used cattle and rum as payment for the construction of Sydney Hospital and the road from Sydney to Liverpool. The suggestion of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810; but it wasn&#x27;t until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the real possibility of such a proposal. In February 1817 seven directors of the bank were elected: D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell was elected the bank&#x27;s first president and Edward Smith Hall as its first cashier and secretary. During the 19th and early 20th century, the Bank opened branches throughout Australia and New Zealand and in the 20th century in Oceania. This included at Moreton Bay (Brisbane) in 1850, then in Victoria (1851), New Zealand (1861), South Australia (1877), Western Australia (1883), Fiji (1901), Papua (now part of Papua New Guinea) (1910) and Tasmania (1910).

Besides expanding its branch network, the bank also expanded by acquiring other banks:

*1927: BNSW acquired the Western Australian Bank, which had been established in 1841 or 1842.
*1931: BNSW acquired the Australian Bank of Commerce, which had branches in both New South Wales and Queensland.
*1942: BNSW suspended operations in Papua after the Japanese Army captured many of the towns in which it had branches and agencies, and bombed Port Moresby. It resumed operations in 1946.
*1946: BNSW resumed operations in Papua.
*1957: BNSW purchased a 40% shareholding in Australian Guarantee Corporation and over the years progressively increased its interest to a majority stake of 76% and then acquired all remaining shares in 1988. 
*1968: BNSW joined Databank Systems consortium in New Zealand to provide joint data processing services. Around this time the bank started going &#x27;on line&#x27; with the use of their computer nicknamed &quot;Fabicus&quot;, the letters standing for &quot;First Australian Banking Institution Computer Used in Sydney&quot;. Fabicus had been in use since 1958 in the processing of some records. With advanced programming, The use of this computer changed the whole concept of banking as it had been done in years previously with its combination of hand-written and machined records. Branches slowly became attached to the data processing centre and other banks slowly joined the ranks of computer-generated reports, records, and expansion.
*1970: BNSW established a branch on Tarawa in Kiribati, which also took over the government savings bank. BNSW was publicly listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 18 July 1970.
*1973: BNSW became the corporate sponsor of the Rescue Helicopter service started by Surf Life Saving Australia. The service is known today as the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service
*1974: BNSW participated in a joint venture to establish the Bank of Tonga.
*1975: BNSW incorporated its local business in Papua New Guinea as Bank of New South Wales (PNG).
*1977: BNSW formed the Pacific Commercial Bank in Samoa as a joint venture with the Bank of Hawaii, buying into Pacific Savings and Loan Company, in which the Bank of Hawaii had had an ownership interest since 1971.
*1981: BNSW merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia. The Parliament of New South Wales passed the &quot;Bank of New South Wales (Change of Name) Act 1982&quot; on 4 May 1982, changing the name of BNSW to Westpac. The new brand incorporates the &quot;W&quot; motif, which had been the logo of BNSW.

==Executive leadership==
===Chief executive===
*Alfred Davidson – General manager (1929–1945)
*Robert Norman – General manager (1964–1977)
*Bob White – Chief general manager (1977–1982)

===President/Chairman===
(Note: In&quot; 200:The Westpac Story&quot; on page 296 there is a chronological list of presidents of the Bank of New South Wales 1817-1982 followed by a list of chairmen of Westpac Banking Corporation 1982–2017.)
==Coat of arms==
In 1931 the bank was granted a coat of arms from the College of Arms, symbolising the 1927 acquisition of the Western Australian Bank. The arms featured an emu and a black swan (which is symbolic of Western Australia) rampant supporting a shield surmounted by a kangaroo and the emblem of the rising sun. On the shield are shown a ship, two sheaves of wheat, a sheep, a cow, and a crossed pick and spade, representing the principal industries of Australia at the time: pastoral, agricultural, mining and shipping. The motto included was &quot;Sic fortis Etruria crevit&quot;, translated as &quot;Thus strong Etruria prospered&quot;, a line taken from Virgil&#x27;s Second Georgic and an early motto of the Colony of New South Wales.

These arms replaced the original arms known as the &quot;Advance Australia Arms&quot; which was similar to the first Coat of arms of Australia used until 1910, using the same kangaroo and emu supporters and the motto &quot;Advance Australia&quot;. The shield in these arms was retained in the 1931 arms.
