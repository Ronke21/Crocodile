<text>The Havasupai people (Havasupai: &quot;Havsuw&#x27; Baaja&quot;) are a Native American people and tribe who have lived in the Grand Canyon for at least the past 800 years. &quot;Hava&quot; means &quot;blue sky,&quot; (or just &#x27;sky&#x27;), &quot;su&quot; means &quot;water,&quot; and &quot;pai&quot; &quot;people&quot;.

Located primarily in an area known as Havasu Canyon, this Yuman-speaking population once laid claim to an area the size of Delaware (). In 1882, however, the United States federal government forced the tribe to abandon all but of its land. A silver rush and the Santa Fe Railroad in effect destroyed the fertile land. Furthermore, the inception of the Grand Canyon as a national park in 1919 pushed the Havasupai to the brink, as their land was consistently being used by the National Park Service. Throughout the 20th century, the tribe used the US judicial system to fight for the restoration of the land. In 1975, the tribe succeeded in regaining approximately of their ancestral land with the passage of the Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act.

As a means of survival, the tribe has turned to tourism, attracting thousands of people annually to its streams and waterfalls at the Havasupai Indian Reservation.

== History ==

=== Relation with Hualapai ===
Ethnically, the Havasupai and the Hualapai are one people, although today, they are politically separate groups due to U.S. government policy. The Hualapai (&quot;Pa&#x27;a&quot; or &quot;Pai&quot;) had three subtribes: the &quot;Plateau People&quot;, &quot;Middle Mountain People,&quot; and &quot;Yavapai Fighter&quot;. The subtribes were divided into seven bands, which themselves were broken up into thirteen regional bands or local groups. The local groups were composed of several extended family groups living in small villages: The Havasupai were just the &quot;Havasooa Pa&#x27;a&quot; regional band (or local group) of the &quot;Nyav-kapai&quot; (&quot;Eastern People&quot;) of the &quot;Plateau People&quot; subtribe.

=== Pre-1882 ===
The tribe had traditionally relied heavily on agriculture, hunting, and gathering as their means of survival. Although living primarily above and inside the Grand Canyon, which consists mostly of harsh terrain, the tribe&#x27;s reservation was also home to some lush vegetation and the aquamarine blue water of Havasu Creek. Their name, meaning &quot;the People of the Blue-Green Waters,&quot; reflects this.

The Havasupai are said to have existed within and around the Grand Canyon for over eight centuries. Little is known about the tribe before their first recorded European encounter in 1776 with Spanish priest Francisco Garcés. Garcés reported seeing roughly 320 individuals in his time with the Havasupai, a number that would diminish over the centuries as westward expansion and natural catastrophes significantly decreased the population size.

In the first half of the 19th century, with the exception of the introduction of horses by the Spanish, U.S. westward expansion affected the Havasupai less than it did other indigenous populations of the West. Even as interaction with settlers slowly increased, day-to-day life did not change much for the tribe until silver was discovered in 1870 by Cataract Creek. The migration of prospectors to the area was unwelcome. The Havasupai sought protection from the intrusion of Western pioneers on their land and sought out assistance, but to little avail. An executive order by President Rutherford Hayes in 1880 established a small federally protected reservation for the tribe, yet it did not include the mining areas along the Creek (Hirst, 1985).

During this era, Havasupai relations with other Native American tribes were generally mixed. Bonds and interactions with the Hopi tribe, whose reservation was in close proximity, were strong, as the two peoples did a great deal of trading with each other. The Hopi introduced crops such as the gourd and sunflower that would eventually become a staple of the Havasupai diet. Still, the Havasupai were not without enemies as they were consistently at odds with the Yavapai and the Southern Paiute, who would steal and destroy crops planted by the Havasupai.

=== 1882–1920 ===

In 1882 President Chester A. Arthur issued an executive order that all land on the plateau of the canyon, which was traditionally used for winter homes for the tribe, was to become public property of the United States. The order in effect relegated the Havasupai to a plot of land in Cataract Canyon, taking almost all of their aboriginal land for American public use. According to reports, the Havasupai were completely unaware of the act for several years.

The loss of almost all of their land was not the only issue that the Havasupai were contending with: the increase in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages. Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles. By 1906 only 166 tribal members remainedhalf the number Garcés saw when he first encountered the tribe in 1776. At one point, there were only 40 women and 40 men of childbearing age, which caused a genetic population bottleneck.

In the 1800s, the continental railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897, construction opened on a spur line of the Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon; by 1901, the line was open. During his visit to the Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Ha’a Gyoh (Havasupai Garden, formerly called Indian Garden). Roosevelt told them about the park that was being created and that they would have to leave the area. In 1908, the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Ha’a Gyoh, forced out by the National Park Service.

=== 1921–1975 ===
Issues regarding health within the Havasupai population reduced its growth to the point where almost an entire generation was lost due to infant and child mortality. Low morale spread throughout the tribe, leading to an increase in gambling, alcoholism, and violence. As the years progressed, the Havasupai came to realize that they could not hope to survive in their American social situation without embracing at least some aspects of it. Breaking horses, working on farms, or even serving as employees of the Grand Canyon National Park were all options for tribal members. The Havasupai fought to keep their methods and traditions alive, but the federal government and the National Park Service generally held a dismissive attitude toward these efforts and accelerated the pace of actions such as razing residents&#x27; traditional homes and replacing them with cabins. As similar instances transpired throughout the years, the methods of the Park became clear: they wanted the final .

In this period, the tribe continually fought with the government to have the land that had been taken returned to them. In 1968, the tribe won its Indian Claim Commission case against the United States. The court findings stated that the Havasupai had portions of their land taken from them illegally in 1882 and that the tribe was entitled to recover the land from the US at fair market value (ICC 210). That value ended up being 55 cents an acre, totaling just over one million dollars. Although the case was a landmark for the Havasupai in the sense that it was proven in a court of law that the federal government had inappropriately taken their land, it had still not been properly returned to the tribe.

However, the momentum that the Havasupai gained from the ICC case followed them into the 1970s as the tribe continued to fight to have their traditional territory returned to them. In 1974, garnering support from the Nixon administration as well as influential newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the San Francisco Chronicle, the tribe made their push to have the congressional bill S. 1296, which would actually return their land, passed through Congress. Months of deliberation and stalling on the part of some congressmen almost led to the bill&#x27;s demise. But days before Congress went on fall break, the bill was finally passed by both Houses and made its way to the President&#x27;s desk. Similarly, the bill sat on President Gerald Ford&#x27;s desk until the final possible moments before it was signed and passed into law on January 4, 1975. S. 1296 granted the Havasupai a trust title to approximately ; another were designated as &quot;Havasupai Use Lands,&quot; to be overseen by the National Park Service but available for traditional use by the Havasupai.

Mining interests also had a presence in the canyon in this period. Tunnels are a familiar sight in the campground area with the deepest of them around . The largest of the mines is in Carbonate Canyon, adjacent to Havasu Falls, where rails and timbers still can be found descending three levels. Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII. Ranger Gale Burak, who worked at the Grand Canyon for several years, spoke of her experiences as a cook for the Havasu Lead and Zinc Company hard rock mining camp, where the campground now resides. Below Mooney Falls, the famous pipe &quot;ladder&quot; ascended to a vanadium deposit.

=== 1976–present ===
 Following the return of a large share of their land, the Havasupai as a tribe have once again begun to flourish. Although many of the day-to-day customs that existed before 1882 are not well established today, the Havasupai have continued to respect and preserve the traditions of their ancestors. As of 2019, the tribe consists of about 730 members, of which about 400 live on the reservation.

Presently, the tribe has begun to take advantage of the beauty of its land by turning it into a tourist destination for visitors to the Grand Canyon. Tribal members often work as packers and/or workers for tourist ventures or work at the lodge, tourist offices, the café, etc.

=== 2003–2010 blood sample controversy ===
In 2003, protests ensued when it was found that Arizona State University had used blood samples consensually acquired from the Havasupai people to &quot;study the causes of behavioral/medical disorders,&quot; with an initial goal of determining whether the high rates of Type 2 diabetes among Havasupai adults were due to the same gene that causes high rates of diabetes in the Pima people. Multiple genetic research studies were done without the consent or permission of the Havasupai. This included one that indicated that their ancestors migrated from Asia to North America, which contradicts the traditional Havasupai belief that the tribe originated in the canyon. Another showed a relatively high level of consanguinity, which can result in health problems. Although this is the normal and expected result of the population bottleneck in the early 20th century, the publication of the results made people feel stigmatized.

ASU incurred legal fees of US$1,700,000 and eventually agreed to pay the 41 Havasupai participants US$700,000. It has since been claimed that scientific study of Native Northern American genomes has been hampered due to scientists&#x27; fears of getting caught up in a similar legal predicament.

== Traditional culture ==

=== Agriculture ===
Before modern times, agriculture was the essential means of progress and survival for the Havasupai. In the winter, the tribe members stationed themselves on the plateau of the canyon; in the summer, irrigation gardening of the crop fields brought the members back inside the canyon walls. As vast and uneven as the Grand Canyon is, it is somewhat of an anomaly that the Havasupai were able to agriculturally sustain and thrive in such a voluminous landscape. Because of a lack of available soil rich in nutrients, it has been suggested that the tribe cultivated only of land on the canyon floor. Although lacking space, the tribe&#x27;s irrigation technology was far more advanced than others in the Southwest, allowing them to be agriculturally intensive. However, being located at the bottom of a canyon left the fields vulnerable to flooding due to rain and the overflowing of Cataract Creek, as was the case in 1911 when almost an entire crop field was destroyed. In 1920, to combat the issue, the federal government assisted the tribe in constructing a new irrigation system which was generally effective in ceasing soil erosion from water overflows.

Historically, the main crops for the Havasupai were corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, gourds, and some cotton. Corn, the tribe&#x27;s main crop, was generally harvested in the later summer months. While growing, a farming technique called &quot;cepukaka&quot; was used to protect the corn from being blown over when it reached a certain height. In this technique, a farmer loosened the soil around the corn and then pulled it into a hill around the stalk base. Along with their traditional crops, the Havasupai were introduced to melons, watermelons, and orchard trees with the arrival of the Spanish. By the 1940s, these crops had become staples of the Havasupai diet.

=== Hunting ===
The bow and arrow were of primary importance to a Havasupai hunter. Built from an unidentifiable tree, an entire process of crafting, bending, and designing went into the construction of these hunting tools. With westward expansion, however, came the introduction of the rifle; as years went by, the gun became the primary hunting device for men. The word for &quot;arrow&quot; began to stand in for &quot;bullet&quot; as well (Whiting, 1985).

Throughout the years, sheep and deer were the dominant game for the Havasupai, but small game, including rabbits and squirrels, were also used as food. Historically, the Havasupai hunted in large groups, and the game distribution amongst the hunters was generally fair. In the twentieth century, however, due to overhunting and neighboring development, the populations of large game animals such as sheep became sparse. As a result, the Havasupai were forced to alter their hunting habits to adjust to the expansionists, making tribesmen less likely to share with others.

=== Gathering ===
The gathering of wild plants and seeds was typically done by Havasupai women. Two primary methods were used: 1) knocking seeds from plants directly, and 2) the heads of plants were gathered before the seeds were ready to fall. It was desirable for the women to locate lighter foods that could easily be moved to the plateau in winter. Additionally, dry foods that could be stored for extended periods of time to prevent spoilage were preferable. Walnuts, wild candytuft, and barrel cacti were only a few of the many plants and seeds gathered by the women throughout the spring and summer months.

== Modern culture ==
=== Government ===
A seven-member tribal council, which handles most policy matters, is elected once every two years. It is led by a chairman who is elected from among the members of the council. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the entity charged with law enforcement and protection for the Tribe, while the Indian Health Service clinic provides health care and emergency services.

=== Language ===
Havasupai is a dialect of the Upland Yuman language spoken by about 450 people on the Havasupai Indian Reservation in and around the Grand Canyon. It is the only Native American language in the United States spoken by 100% of its indigenous population. The Havasupai variety is nearly identical to the variety of the Hualapai, although the two groups are socially and politically distinct (Kendall 1983:5) and employ different orthographies. The speakers of Havasupai and Hualapai consider their languages separate. It is a little more distantly related to the Yavapai language. Grammatical descriptions, vocabularies, and texts documenting Havasupai have been published (Mithun 1999:578).
=== Supai ===
Supai () is the Havasupai city at at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The town is the capital of the Havasupai Indian Reservation, at in Coconino County. It is home to around 400 of the tribe members and is one of the most remote cities in the contiguous United States, as it can only be accessed by taking old U.S. Route 66 and traveling about along BIA Road 18 to the trailhead. The city can be reached from the trailhead via an hike. An alternative to the hike is a helicopter ride or a horse ride. The town has 136 houses, a café, a general store, a tourist office, a lodge, a post office, a school, among other buildings.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism is the main source of revenue for the Havasupai tribe. The town receives 30,000 to 40,000 visitors per year. The Tribe charges for entering its land, and visitors are required to reserve either a room at their lodge or a space at the campground.

== Havasupai Trail ==


The trailhead is at Hualapai Hilltop, Arizona (located at the end of BIA Road 18), where there is a large parking lot, a helipad, and portable toilets. The trail can be traveled by foot or horseback. Alternatively, transportation by helicopter is periodically available. Mule service can also be purchased for luggage/packs only. The trail to Supai is approximately long and descends approximately . The campground is an additional , with another drop of about .

== Havasu Creek ==

Havasu Creek runs through Supai. The creek has several waterfalls, including Havasu Falls.

<text>The 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler or SS Division Leibstandarte, abbreviated as LSSAH (), began as Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal bodyguard unit, responsible for guarding the Führer&#x27;s person, offices, and residences. Initially the size of a regiment, the LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division-sized unit during World War II.

The LSSAH participated in combat during the invasion of Poland and was amalgamated into the Waffen-SS together with the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT) and the combat units of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV) prior to Operation Barbarossa in 1941. By mid-1942 it had been increased in size from a regiment to a division and was designated SS Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;. It received its final form as a Panzer division in October 1943.

Members of the LSSAH perpetrated numerous atrocities and war crimes, including the Malmedy massacre. They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940–1945, mostly on the Eastern Front.
==Early history (1923–1933)==
In the early days of the Nazi Party, the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. Ernst Röhm formed a guard formation from the &quot;19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie&quot;; from this formation the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) soon evolved. Adolf Hitler in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than &quot;a suspect mass&quot;, such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the &quot;Stabswache&quot; (staff guard). The &quot;Stabswache&quot; were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; (&quot;death&#x27;s head&quot;) as the unit&#x27;s insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used &quot;Hutier&quot; infiltration tactics.

In May 1923, the unit was renamed &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; (Shock Troop)–Hitler. The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time. On 9 November 1923, the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, were disbanded.

In the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics. Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (protection command). The unit was renamed the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot;, abbreviated to SS. By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the &quot;Stabswache&quot;, which was mostly made up of men from the 1st SS-Standarte. By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of Sepp Dietrich, who selected 117 men to form the &quot;SS-Stabswache&quot; Berlin on 17 March 1933. The unit replaced the army guards at the Reich Chancellery. Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the Waffen-SS. Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery. Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Zossen&quot; on 10 May, and a second unit, designated &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Jüterbog&quot; on 8 July. These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army. On 3 September 1933 the two &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; merged into the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Berlin&quot; under Dietrich&#x27;s command. Most of their duties involved providing outer security for Hitler at his residences, public appearances and guard duty at the Reich Chancellery.

In November 1933, on the 10th anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch, the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; took part in the rally and memorial service for the Nazi Party members who had been killed during the putsch. During the ceremony, the members of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; swore personal allegiance to Hitler. At the conclusion the unit received the new title, &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot; (LAH). The term &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; was derived partly from &quot;Leibgarde&quot; – a somewhat archaic German translation of &quot;Guard of Corps&quot; or personal bodyguard of a military leader (&quot;Leib&quot; = lit. &quot;body, torso&quot;) – and &quot;Standarte&quot;: the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) or &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) term for a regiment-sized unit, also the German word for a specific type of heraldic flag (Standard).

==Expansion==
On 13 April 1934, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered the &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot; (LAH) to be renamed &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; (LSSAH). Himmler inserted the SS initials into the name to make it clear that the unit was independent from the SA or the army. The LSSAH was designated a &quot;National Socialist&quot; unit, which eventually grew into an elite Panzer Division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.

During 1934, &quot;Stabschef-SA&quot; Ernst Röhm continued to push for greater political influence for his already powerful SA. Hitler decided that the SA had to be eliminated as an independent political force and ordered the LSSAH to prepare for the action. The LSSAH formed two companies under the control of Jürgen Wagner and Otto Reich, these formations were moved to Munich on 30 June.

Hitler ordered all SA leaders to attend a meeting at the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, near Munich. Hitler along with Sepp Dietrich and a unit from the LSSAH travelled to Bad Wiessee to personally oversee Röhm&#x27;s arrest on 30 June. Later at around 17:00 hours, Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the LSSAH to form an &quot;execution squad&quot; and go to Stadelheim prison where certain SA leaders were being held. There in the prison courtyard, the LSSAH firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel. Additional alleged &quot;traitors&quot; were shot in Berlin by a unit of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;. On 1 July Hitler finally agreed with Göring and Himmler that Röhm should be executed. In what the Nazis called the Röhm Putsch, but otherwise came to be known as the Night of the Long Knives, companies of the LSSAH, together with the Gestapo and Göring&#x27;s &quot;Landespolizeigruppe&quot;, performed Death Squad actions. At least 85, but most likely no less than twice that number of people, were executed without trial over the next few days.

This action succeeded in effectively decapitating the SA and removing Röhm&#x27;s threat to Hitler&#x27;s leadership. In recognition of their actions, both the LSSAH and the &quot;Landespolizeigruppe&quot; &quot;General Göring&quot; were expanded to regimental size and motorized. In addition, the SS became an independent organization, no longer part of the SA.
The LSSAH provided the honor guard at many of the Nuremberg Rallies, and in 1935 took part in the reoccupation of the Saarland. On 6 June 1935, the LSSAH officially adopted a field-grey uniform to identify itself more with the army, which wore a similar uniform. The LSSAH was later in the vanguard of the march into Austria as part of the Anschluss, and in 1938 the unit took part in the occupation of the Sudetenland. By 1939, the LSSAH was a full infantry regiment with three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and anti-tank, reconnaissance and engineer sub-units. Soon after its involvement in the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia, the LSSAH was redesignated &quot;Infanterie-Regiment Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (mot.)&quot;. When Hitler ordered the formation of an SS division in mid-1939, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; was designated to form its own unit, unlike the other &quot;Standarten&quot; of the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT) (&quot;SS-Standarte Deutschland&quot;, &quot;SS-Standarte Germania&quot;, and &quot;SS-Standarte Der Führer&quot;). The Polish crisis of August 1939 put these plans on hold, and the LSSAH was ordered to join XIII. &quot;Armeekorps&quot;, a part of Army Group South, which was preparing for the attack on Poland.

The &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; division&#x27;s symbol was a skeleton key, in honor of its first commander, Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich (&quot;Dietrich&quot; is German for skeleton key or lock pick); it was retained and modified to later serve as the symbol for I SS Panzer Corps.

==Invasion of Poland==
During the initial stages of the invasion of Poland, the LSSAH was attached to the &quot;17. Infanterie-Division&quot; and tasked with providing flank protection for the southern pincer. The regiment was involved in several battles against Polish cavalry brigades attempting to hit the flanks of the German advance. At Pabianice, a town near Łódź, the LSSAH fought elements of the Polish 28th Infantry Division and the Wołyńska Cavalry Brigade in close combat. Throughout the campaign, the unit was notorious for burning villages. In addition, members of the LSSAH committed atrocities in numerous Polish towns, including the murder of 50 Jews in Błonie and the massacre of 200 civilians, including children, who were machine gunned in Złoczew. Shootings also took place in Bolesławiec, Torzeniec, Goworowo, Mława, and Włocławek.

After the success at Pabianice, the LSSAH was sent to the area near Warsaw and attached to the &quot;4. Panzer-Division&quot; under then &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (brigadier general) Georg-Hans Reinhardt. The unit saw action preventing encircled Polish units from escaping and repelling several attempts by other Polish troops to break through. In spite of the swift military victory over Poland, the regular army had reservations about the performance of the LSSAH and SS-VT units due to their higher casualty rate than the army units.

==Invasion of France==
In early 1940 the LSSAH was expanded into a full independent motorized infantry regiment and a &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; (Assault Gun) battery was added to their establishment. The regiment was shifted to the Dutch border for the launch of Fall Gelb. It was to form the vanguard of the ground advance into the Netherlands, tasked with capturing a vital bridge over the IJssel, attacking the main line of defense at the &quot;Grebbeberg&quot; (the Grebbeline), and linking up with the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Kurt Student&#x27;s airborne forces, the &quot;7. Flieger-Division&quot; and the &quot;22. Luftlande-Infanterie-Division&quot;.

&quot;Fall Gelb&quot;—the invasion of France and the Low Countries—was launched on 10 May 1940. On that day, the LSSAH crossed the Dutch border, covered over , and secured a crossing over the IJssel near Zutphen after discovering that their target bridge had been destroyed. Over the next four days, the LSSAH covered over , and upon entering Rotterdam, several of its soldiers accidentally shot at and seriously wounded General Student. After the surrender of Rotterdam, the LSSAH left for The Hague, which they reached on 15 May, after capturing 3,500 Dutch soldiers as prisoners of war. After the surrender of the Netherlands on 15 May, the regiment was then moved south to France.

After the British counterattack at Arras, the LSSAH, along with the &quot;SS-Verfügungs-Division&quot;, were moved to hold the perimeter around Dunkirk and reduce the size of the pocket containing the encircled British Expeditionary Force and French forces. The LSSAH took up a position 15 miles southwest of Dunkirk along the line of the Aa Canal, facing the Allied defensive line near Watten. That night the OKW ordered the advance to halt, with the British Expeditionary Force trapped. The LSSAH paused for the night. However, on the following day of 25 May, in defiance of Hitler&#x27;s orders, Dietrich ordered his 3rd battalion to cross the canal and take the Wattenberg Heights beyond, where British artillery observers were putting the regiment at risk. They assaulted the heights and drove the observers off. Instead of being censured for his act of defiance, Dietrich was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

On 26 May the German advance resumed. By 28 May the LSSAH had taken the village of Wormhout, only ten miles from Dunkirk. After their surrender, soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, along with some other units (including French soldiers) were taken to a barn in &quot;La Plaine au Bois&quot; near Wormhout and Esquelbecq. It was there that troops of the LSSAH 2nd battalion, under the command of SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke committed the Wormhoudt massacre, where 80 British and French prisoners of war were killed. Although it is unarguable that the massacre occurred, Mohnke&#x27;s level of involvement is impossible to know; he was never formally charged and brought to trial.

==Invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece==

After the conclusion of the Western campaign on 22 June 1940, the LSSAH spent six months in Metz (Moselle). It was expanded to brigade size (6,500 men). A &#x27;Flak battalion&#x27; and a StuG &quot;Batterie&quot; were among the units added to the LSSAH. A new flag was presented by Heinrich Himmler in September 1940. During the later months of 1940, the regiment trained in amphibious assaults on the Moselle River in preparation for Operation Seelöwe, the invasion of England. After the Luftwaffe&#x27;s failure in the Battle of Britain and the cancellation of the planned invasion, the LSSAH was shifted to Bulgaria in February 1941 in preparation for Operation Marita, part of the planned invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia.

The operation was launched on 6 April 1941 by aerial bombings of central-southern Yugoslavia, especially over Belgrade, causing enormous destruction and thousands of victims and wounded. After the LSSAH entered on 12 April into the Yugoslavian capital, then to follow the route of the 9. Panzer-Division, part of &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Georg Stumme&#x27;s XL Panzer Corps. The LSSAH crossed the border near Bitola and was soon deep in Greek territory.

The LSSAH captured Vevi on 10 April. SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Kurt Meyer&#x27;s reinforced &quot;Aufklärungs-Abteilung&quot; (reconnaissance battalion), LSSAH was tasked with clearing resistance from the Kleisoura Pass south-west of Vevi and driving through to the Kastoria area to cut off retreating Greek and British Commonwealth forces. Despite stiff resistance, Meyer&#x27;s unit captured the pass.

The brigade participated in the clearing the Klidi Pass just south of Vevi, which was defended by a &quot;scratch force&quot; of Greek, Australian, British and New Zealand troops. An Australian artillery officer wrote of the Germans&#x27; &quot;insolence&quot; in driving &quot;trucks down the main road – to within of our infantry&quot; and there unloading the troops. The Germans were forced off the road by artillery fire and faced fierce resistance for more than two days. On the morning of 12 April the Germans renewed their attack, and by late afternoon the pass was cleared.

With the fall of the two passes the main line of resistance of the Greek Epirus army was broken, and the campaign became a battle to prevent the escape of the enemy. On 20 April, following a pitched battle in the Metsovon Pass in the Pindus Mountains, the commander of the Greek Epirus army surrendered the entire force to Dietrich. British Commonwealth troops were now the only Allied forces remaining in Greece, and they were falling back across the Corinth Canal to the Peloponnesos. By 26 April the LSSAH had reached the Gulf of Patras, and in an effort to cut off the retreating British Commonwealth forces, Dietrich ordered that his regiment cross the Gulf and secure the town of Patras in the Peloponnesus. Since no transport vessels were available, the LSSAH commandeered fishing boats and successfully completed the crossing but were forced to leave much of their heavy equipment behind. By 30 April the last British Commonwealth troops had either been captured or escaped. The LSSAH occupied a position of honor in the victory parade through Athens. After Operation Marita, the LSSAH was ordered north to join the forces of Army Group South massing for the launch of Operation Barbarossa.

==Invasion of the Soviet Union==
Following LSSAH&#x27;s outstanding performance during Marita, Himmler ordered that it should be upgraded to divisional status. The regiment, already the size of a reinforced brigade, was to be given motorized transport and redesignated &quot;SS-Division (mot.) Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;. It was moved to Czechoslovakia in mid May for reorganization until being ordered to assemble in Poland for &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;, as part of Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group South. There was not enough time to deliver all its equipment and refit it to full divisional status before the launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union, so the new &quot;division&quot; remained the size of a reinforced brigade, even though its expansion and development was of concern at the very highest ranks of command. Franz Halder, chief of the OKH General Staff noted on 20 June that &quot;SS &#x27;Adolf Hitler&#x27; will not be ready in time. Tracked components leave on 22 June, others not before 25 June,&quot; then more hopefully the next day; &quot;Materiel position of SS &#x27;Adolf Hitler&#x27; has improved, Div. may yet get ready in time.&quot;
Despite Halder&#x27;s hopes, LSSAH was held in reserve attached to XIV Panzer Corps as part of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Ewald von Kleist&#x27;s 1st Panzer Group during the opening stages of the attack. Through July it was attached to III Panzer Corps before finishing August as part of XLVIII Panzer Corps. During this time, the LSSAH was involved in the Battle of Uman and the subsequent capture of Kiev. According to a postwar report by Waffen-SS journalist Erich Kern, the division murdered 4,000 Soviet prisoners in reprisal on 18 August, after finding the mutilated bodies of six dead divisional members who had been executed at Nowo Danzig, north of Kherson. These allegations have been researched using local units&#x27; war diaries; no mention of executed German soldiers during those dates has been found. For want of reliable evidence, not even accusations by the Soviet authorities, the allegations remained unproven.
In early September, the division was shifted to LIV Army Corps, as part of the 11th Army under Eugen Ritter von Schobert during the advance east after the fall of Kiev. Hoping to capitalize on the collapse of the Red Army defense on the Dnepr River the reconnaissance battalion of LSSAH was tasked with making a speedy advance to capture the strategically vital choke point of the Perekop Isthmus through a &quot;coup de main&quot; but were rebuffed by entrenched defenders at the town of Perekop. That same day, 12 September, 11th Army&#x27;s commander was killed in an aircraft accident, and Hitler appointed Erich von Manstein to command. It took five days for Manstein to take matters in hand, and the operation to clear the Crimean Peninsula was not launched until 17 September. Manstein deployed LSSAH to create diversions while preparing for the main assault, intending to employ it to exploit an eventual breakthrough, but was forced to throw pioneers into the attack on the &quot;Tatar Ditch&quot; in the face of a furious counterattacks and did not break the Soviet defense for ten days.

On 8 October 1941, the LSSAH captured the major coastal city of Mariupol, catching the Soviets off guard.

In October, the LSSAH was transferred back north to help solidify the Axis line against fresh Soviet attacks against the Romanian 3rd Army and later took part in the heavy fighting for the city of Rostov-on-Don, which was captured in late November; there, the LSSAH took over 10,000 Red Army prisoners. However, by the end of the year, the German advance faltered as Soviet resistance grew stronger.

Under pressure from heavy Soviet counterattacks during the winter, the LSSAH and Army Group South retreated from Rostov to defensive lines on the river Mius. After the spring rasputitsa (seasonal mud) had cleared, the division joined in &quot;Fall Blau&quot;, participating in the fighting to retake Rostov-on-Don, which fell in late July 1942. Severely understrength, the LSSAH was transferred to the Normandy region of occupied France to join the newly formed SS Panzer Corps and to be reformed as a division.

===Kharkov===

The LSSAH spent the remainder of 1942 refitting as a division. Thanks to the efforts of Himmler, along with SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Paul Hausser, the SS Panzer Corps commander, the three &quot;SS &quot; divisions, LSSAH, Das Reich and Totenkopf, were to be formed with a full regiment of tanks rather than only a battalion. This meant that the &quot;SS &quot; divisions were full-strength Panzer divisions in all but name. The division also received nine Tiger 1 tanks, and these were formed into the 13th (&quot;schwere&quot;) Company/1st SS Panzer Regiment.

The collapse of the front around Stalingrad and the encirclement of the 6th Army created a threat to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein&#x27;s Army Group Don. Manstein requested reinforcements to halt the Soviet attack near Kharkov. The SS Panzer Corps was then ordered east to join Manstein&#x27;s forces.
Arriving at the front in late January 1943, the LSSAH was engaged in fighting in and around Kharkov as a part of Hausser&#x27;s &quot;SS Panzer&quot; Corps. In March 1943 the division participated in the recapture of Kharkiv. On 12 March 1943, the LSSAH made progress into the city&#x27;s center by breaking through the Soviet defenses in the northern suburbs. By the end of the day, the division had reached a position just two blocks north of Dzerzhinsky Square. The 2nd Regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion was able to surround the square, after taking heavy casualties from Soviet snipers and other defenders, by evening. When taken, the square was renamed &quot;Platz der Leibstandarte&quot;. Despite the declaration that the city had fallen, fighting continued on 15 and 16 March, as German units cleared the remnants of resistance in the tractor works factory complex, in the southern outskirts of the city. The city was taken on 17 March. While in Kharkiv, troops of the LSSAH engaged in the murder of wounded Soviet soldiers that were located in the city&#x27;s military hospital; several hundred were killed. Additionally, captured Soviet officers and commissars were routinely executed.

The division was pulled back to rest and refit. Division commander Sepp Dietrich was promoted to form a new Corps, the 1st &quot;SS Panzer Corps Leibstandarte&quot;, and the LSSAH was to supply all the senior officers for the new headquarters. At the same time a new SS division would be formed from members of the Hitler Youth and the LSSAH would supply all of the regimental, battalion and most of the company commanders. This new division would become the 12th SS Panzer Division (&quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;).

===Massacre of civilians on the Eastern Front===
During the fighting around Kharkov, a unit under the command of Joachim Peiper gained a nickname &quot;Blowtorch Battalion&quot;, after the inhabitants of two Soviet villages were shot or burned. Ukrainian sources, including surviving witness Ivan Kiselev, who was 14 at the time of the massacre, described the killings at the villages of Yefremovka and Semyonovka on 17 February 1943. On 12 February Waffen-SS troops of the LSSAH occupied the two villages, where retreating Soviet forces had wounded two SS officers. In retaliation, five days later LSSAH troops killed 872 men, women and children. Some 240 of these were burned alive in the church of Yefremovka.

The reputation of the &quot;Blowtorch Battalion&quot; was confirmed in August 1944, when &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Jacob Hanreich was captured south of Falaise in France and interrogated by the Allies. He stated that Peiper was &quot;particularly eager to execute the order to burn villages&quot;. Hanreich had previously served with &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; but was with SS Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; at the time of his capture.

Additional sources support the division&#x27;s reputation for brutality. The following statement, taken from the surreptitious recording of POWs&#x27; conversations by the Allies, describes the atrocities on the Eastern Front. SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Krämer (captured on the Western Front during his service with the SS Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;) recounted the following from his time with the LSSAH: 
I have experienced it in Russia at Orel. An MG 42 was set up in the main aisle of a church, [...] and the Russian men, women and children were taken into the church, without knowing at all what was happening. Then they were shot immediately with the MG 42 and petrol was poured on them and the whole place was set on fire.

===Fabrikaktion Operation===
Elements of LSSAH took part in Fabrikaktion (&quot;factory action”), also known as the &quot;Großaktion Juden&quot; (&quot;Major Action [on] Jews”), an operation to capture remaining German Jews working in the arms industry. Men of the LSSAH helped the Gestapo round up Jews in Berlin; people were taken from their jobs and herded into cattle wagons on 27–28 February 1943. Most of the captured perished either in Auschwitz or other camps in the East. In May 1943, Hans Frank shipped 500 watches collected from Auschwitz prisoners to soldiers of the 3rd SS Panzer Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot;.

==Battle of Kursk==
The spring &quot;rasputitsa&quot; halted offensive operations, giving the LSSAH time to rest and refit. By early June 1943, the division had been fully refitted and was now under the command of SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;, Theodor Wisch. Its armor strength was 12 Tiger Is, 72 Panzer IVs, 16 Panzer III and Panzer IIs, and 31 StuGs. In late June 1943, the formation of I SS Panzer Corps meant that Hausser&#x27;s &quot;SS Panzer&quot; Corps was renamed II SS Panzer Corps.
The II SS Panzer Corps was moved north to Belgorod in preparation for the upcoming summer offensive Operation Citadel. The LSSAH, along with the SS Divisions Totenkopf and Das Reich, was to form the spearhead of General Hermann Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, tasked with breaching the southern flank of the Kursk salient. Field Marshal Walter Model&#x27;s 9th Army was to breach the northern flank, and the two forces were to meet near the city of Kursk, to the east, thereby encircling a large Soviet force.
The attack commenced on 5 July. The LSSAH&#x27;s panzers, advancing in &quot;Panzerkeil&quot;s (wedges), soon ran into the elaborate defenses of the Red Army, which slowed the advance. Untersturmführer Michael Wittman, a Tiger commander in Leibstandarte&#x27;s heavy company, destroyed eight enemy tanks and seven anti-tank guns on the first day of battle.

On 8 July, &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Franz Staudegger, another Tiger commander, halted for repairs in the town of Teterevino and became separated from his company. He became aware of a nearby Soviet armored counterattack developing and rushed the repairs on his tank to meet the threat. Staudegger and his crew spotted the enemy vanguard and took out seventeen T-34s in two hours. The Russian attack was now faltering, so Staudegger pressed his Tiger forward into the retreating enemy flanks, switching to high-explosive shells after exhausting his armor-piercing ammmunition. By day&#x27;s end, Staudegger&#x27;s Tiger had destroyed twenty-two T-34s, for which he won the Knight&#x27;s Cross.

By 9 July, the II SS Panzer Corps had advanced north and were nearing the small town of Prokhorovka. The LSSAH again took the lead; by now its strength was reduced to just 77 armored vehicles. The 2nd SS Regiment, supported by several tanks, advanced up the road to Prokhorovka against heavy resistance. By midday, the infantry had cleared the Komsomolets State Farm and begun the attack on Hill 241.6, which they secured shortly after nightfall on 10 July.

The next day the advance resumed, with the division capturing Oktiabr&#x27;skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against Soviet paratroopers of the 9th Guards Airborne Division. On 12 July, the Soviets threw the 5th Guards Tank Army into a counterattack near Prokhorovka. Two tank corps faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr&#x27;skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. The Soviet counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr&#x27;skii. Fighting continued the next day, but the focus of the Soviet attack had then shifted to the Totenkopf, on the left of the LSSAH.

With the battle at Prokhorovka still in the balance, Soviet High Command launched an offensive of their own, Operation Kutuzov, near Orel causing Hitler to order the cessation of Citadel. The II SS Panzer Corps was pulled back. The LSSAH was ordered out of the line, having suffered 2,753 casualties including 474 killed. Eleven tanks were also lost during Citadel. The division was sent to Italy to help stabilize the situation there caused by the deposal of Benito Mussolini by the Badoglio government and the Allied invasion of Sicily which began on the night of 9–10 July 1943. The division left behind its heavy equipment, which was given to Das Reich and Totenkopf.

==Italy and subsequent operations ==
The division, re-equipped with vehicles, arrived on the Po River Plain on 8 August 1943. The LSSAH was given the task of guarding several vital road and rail junctions in the area of Trento-Verona. After several weeks, the division was moved to the Parma-Reggio area. During this period, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; was involved in several skirmishes with partisans. With Italy having announced an armistice with the Allies of 8 September 1943, the division was ordered to begin disarming nearby Royal Italian Army units. This went smoothly, with the exception of brief, bloody fights with Italian troops stationed in Parma, Cremona and Piacenza on 9 September. By 19 September, all Italian forces in the Po River Plain had been disarmed.

While on rear security duties in Italy, LSSAH men murdered 49 Jewish refugees near Lake Maggiore, in the Lake Maggiore massacres, who had fled there after the German takeover. The murders happened between 15 and 24 September. Some of the victims had their feet and hands tied and were drowned.

The LSSAH was sent to the Istria Peninsula and was engaged in several anti-partisan operations as part of Nazi security warfare. During its period in Italy, the LSSAH was reformed as a full panzer division, and redesignated 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler. In early November, the division was ordered back to the Eastern Front, arriving in the Zhitomir area in mid-November.

The division was assigned to XLVIII Panzer Corps, a part of 4th Panzer Army, which was struggling to hold the line near Zhitomir. The division was transferred to the Cherkassy area at the end of January, where it was assigned to the III Panzer Corps, part of 1st Panzer Army. As part of the corps, the division took part in the relief attempt of German forces of Army Group South encircled in the Korsun Pocket in January–February 1944.

The majority of the LSSAH, which amounted to 41 officers and 1,188 men, were withdrawn to Belgium for rest and refit, however a &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; was left behind. On 25 March, the 1st Panzer Army was encircled in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. The battle group took part in the fighting to escape the encirclement, forming a part of the spearhead which linked up with the II SS Panzer Corps near Buczacz on 6 April. The LSSAH Division was reformed in Belgium and was at full strength by 25 April 1944.

==Western Front==
The division was transferred again as part of the I SS Panzer Corps which at this time consisted of the 101 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion, SS Division Hitlerjugend, SS Division Götz von Berlichingen and the Panzer Lehr Division. The LSSAH had been positioned north of the River Seine to counter any possible landing in the area of the Pas de Calais so the first units did not arrive in Normandy until after the Allied invasion there on 6 June 1944; part of it arrived on the night of 27–28 June with the whole division taking another week. By 4 July the I SS Panzer Corps was reformed, and now consisted of the LSSAH and the Hitlerjugend. The first action they were involved in was the defense of Carpiquet village and airfield in the Allied Operation Windsor. There then followed a number of Allied attacks – Operations Charnwood and Jupiter. On 12 July the LSSAH was holding the Caen south sector from Maltot in the west to the Caen – Falaise road in the east. During the night of 14–15 July, LSSAH was relieved by the 272nd Infantry Division and pulled back to an assembly area astride the Caen – Falaise road between Ifs and Cintheaux.

===Operation Goodwood===

The British Operation Goodwood took place between 18 and 20 July 1944. British VIII Corps, with three armored divisions, launched the attack aiming to seize the German-held Bourguébus Ridge, along with the area between Bretteville-sur-Laize and Vimont. The operation was preceded by a three-hour bombing by 2,500 aircraft. The Division strength prior to Goodwood was reported as 59 Panzer IVs, 46 Panthers and 35 StuG IIIs.

II/1st SS Panzer Regiment, located near Garcelles, received orders to attack the British at Soliers. While moving its 13 Panthers towards Bourguébus, the unit engaged 60 British tanks, destroying 20 of them and capturing Soliers. Around 12:00, the Panther Battalion, I/1st SS Panzer regiment, was engaged in combat with the British 29th Armoured Brigade of the British 11th Armoured Division. The body of the LSSAH was rushed to the front from Falaise, where it was being held in reserve. It counterattacked at 17:00, together with the 21st Panzer Division, and halted the British offensive on the left front.

The British resumed their assault at around 13:00 on 19 July, having brought up reinforcements to continue the attack. They overran some of the forward German units and approached Bourguébus Ridge at 16:00. They came under fire from Panthers of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;, who had taken up positions on the ridge. Reinforcements of the 12th SS Panzer Division arrived at the right flank at around 15:00. The Canadians attacked next in the Battle of Verrières Ridge and Operation Spring (see map), where the LSSAH came up against a number of Allied divisions, including the Guards Armoured Division, 7th Armoured, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions.

===Operation Lüttich===
On 25 July 1944, US forces under General Omar Bradley succeeded in breaking through the German defenses as part of Operation Cobra and entered Brittany. Hitler forbade any retreat, and ordered a counteroffensive, codenamed Operation Lüttich, by the XLVII Panzer Corps, consisting of the 2nd Panzer Division, part of the LSSAH, the SS Division Das Reich and the 116th Panzer Division. The plan for the attack was to hit the 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. The US response was aided by Ultra intelligence, which had revealed the plans for Operation Lüttich by 4 August. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.

The LSSAH and other divisions went on the attack on 7 August. The 1st SS Panzer Regiment, along with two battalions of motorized infantry, one combat engineer company, and the division&#x27;s flak battalion, were used for the attack. The weather was not suitable for flying that morning, which disadvantaged the Allies. The SS Division Das Reich recaptured Mortain, and an armored battle group under Joachim Peiper reached Bourlopin, but had to halt due to US counterattacks and air strikes.

The much-reduced division was encircled in the Falaise pocket by US, Canadian, and Polish forces. Some LSSAH units broke out of the pocket on 22 August, leaving behind all their tanks and artillery. The division sustained 5,000 casualties during the Normandy campaign. During their retreat from France, members of the LSSAH and the SS Division Hitlerjugend division murdered 34 French civilians in the towns of Tavaux and Plomion.

===Ardennes Offensive===


The Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was a major German offensive launched through the forested Ardennes Mountains region of Belgium, France and Luxembourg. The offensive was called &quot;Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein&quot; (Operation &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;) by the Germans. The &#x27;bulge&#x27; was the initial incursion the Germans put into the Allies&#x27; line of advance, as seen in maps presented in contemporary newspapers.

Wilhelm Mohnke, now in command of the LSSAH, attached to the I SS Panzer Corps, was the spearhead of the operation. The fuel crisis in Nazi Germany meant that the LSSAH had insufficient amounts of fuel for its vehicles. On 16 December the operation began, with then SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Joachim Peiper&#x27;s &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; leading the push to the Meuse.

===Malmedy massacre===

Peiper was supposed to reach the Meuse River on the first day of the offensive. Instead, he was delayed by almost an entire day by a recon platoon at Lanzerath Ridge. Then, unable to dislodge the 99th Infantry Division from Elsenborn Ridge, he diverted to an alternative road to the south. At 07:00 on 17 December, the unit seized a US fuel depot at Büllingen, and refueled before continuing westward. At 12:30, near the hamlet of Baugnez, on the height halfway between the town of Malmedy and Ligneuville, Peiper&#x27;s Kampfgruppe encountered a convoy of the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion, US 7th Armored Division.

After a brief battle the Americans surrendered. Along with other Americans captured earlier (127 men total), they were disarmed and sent to stand in a field near the crossroads, where the Germans shot them en masse with machine guns and pistols. Of the 84 men killed, 41 were killed by a pistol shot to the head at close range and six were killed by having their skulls bashed in. After feigning death in the field for several hours while the Germans moved among them shooting survivors, a group of about 30 men escaped. Researcher Danny S. Parker believe that Peiper or one of his subordinates made the decision to kill the prisoners. There is no record of an SS officer giving an execution order. News of the killings raced through the Allied lines. Captured SS men who were part of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; were tried during the Malmedy massacre trial following the war for this massacre and several others in the area. Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang, but the sentences were commuted. Peiper himself was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings.

Peiper entered Stavelot on 18 December but encountered fierce resistance from the American defenders. Unable to defeat them, he left a smaller support force in town and headed for the bridge at Trois-Ponts with the bulk of his strength, but by the time he reached it, retreating US engineers had already destroyed it. Peiper then headed for the village of La Gleize and from there on to Stoumont. There, as Peiper approached, engineers blew up the bridge. US defenders were entrenched and ready. Peiper&#x27;s men were cut off from the main German force and supplies when the Americans recaptured the poorly defended Stavelot on 19 December. As their situation in Stoumont was becoming hopeless, Peiper decided to pull back to La Gleize where he set up his defenses, waiting for the German relief force. Since no such force was able to penetrate the US line, Peiper decided to break out back to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; abandoned their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the men were able to escape.

With each passing day, enemy resistance stiffened and the advance was eventually halted on all fronts. The German High Command ordered that a renewed attack begin on 1 January 1945. Yet by this time, the Allies had regrouped their forces and were ready to repulse any attack launched by the Germans. The operation formally ended on 27 January 1945, and three days later Mohnke was promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;. LSSAH and the I SS Panzer Corps were then transferred to Hungary to bolster the crumbling situation there. Mohnke was wounded in an air raid. In his place, SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Otto Kumm was appointed the new Division Commander as of 15 February 1945.

====Killing of Wereth 11====
During Battle of the Bulge, troops from &quot;3./SS-PzAA1 LSSAH&quot; captured eleven African-American soldiers from the 333rd Artillery Battalion in the hamlet of Wereth. Subsequently the prisoners were shot and their remains found by Allied troops two months later. The soldiers had their fingers cut off, legs broken, and at least one was shot while trying to bandage a comrade&#x27;s wounds.

==Eastern Front 1945==
=== Operation Spring Awakening ===

Operation Spring Awakening (6 March 1945 – 16 March 1945) was the last major German offensive launched during World War II. It began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945. The German forces launched attacks in Hungary near Lake Balaton. This area included some of the last oil reserves still available to the Axis. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the failed Ardennes Offensive on the Western Front, including the 6th SS Panzer Army and the LSSAH. Operation Spring Awakening was a failure for the German side. Within a week, the early gains were halted by massive counter-attacks by Soviet forces. The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, yet Hitler somehow had believed victory was attainable.

After the failure of Operation Spring Awakening, Sepp Dietrich&#x27;s 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the Vienna area. The Germans prepared defensive positions in an attempt to hold the city against the fast arriving Red Army, in what become known as the Vienna Offensive. The Germans could not hold Vienna, which fell to the Soviet forces on 13 April.

This defeat resulted in the &quot;Ärmelstreifen&quot; (Cuff Titles Order) or &quot;armband order&quot;, which was issued by Hitler to the commander of the 6th SS Panzer Army, Sepp Dietrich. Hitler claimed that the troops &quot;did not fight as the situation demanded.&quot; As a mark of disgrace, Hitler ordered the Waffen-SS units involved to remove their cuff titles (German: &quot;Ärmelstreifen&quot;). Dietrich refused to carry out the order and did not relay the message to the troops. According to Heinz Guderian, most cuff titles had already been removed; he later wrote that the removal of unit cuffs from the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot;, &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot;, and the &quot;Das Reich&quot; Divisions was accomplished for security reasons.

===Battle of Berlin===


Part of the LSSAH ended the war fighting in Berlin. On 23 April 1945, Hitler appointed &quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Mohnke the commander for the central government district (Zitadelle sector) that included the Reich Chancellery and &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Mohnke&#x27;s command post was under the Reich Chancellery in the bunkers therein. He formed &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Mohnke which was divided into two weak regiments made up of approximately 2,000 men. The core group were the 800 of the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; Guard Battalion (assigned to guard the Führer). After Hitler&#x27;s suicide, they received orders to break out. Prior to the attempt, Mohnke briefed all commanders who could be reached within the Zitadelle sector about Hitler&#x27;s death and the planned break out. It started at 2300 hours on 1 May. Mohnke led the first of ten small groups. Several very small groups managed to reach the Americans at the Elbe&#x27;s west bank, but most, including Mohnke&#x27;s group, could not get through the Soviet lines. Many were taken prisoner and some committed suicide. On 2 May hostilities officially ended by order of Helmuth Weidling, Commandant of the Berlin Defense Area.

After Vienna was captured, the LSSAH had fewer than 1,600 men and 16 tanks. Apart from the remains of Berlin Guard Battalion, the LSSAH surrendered to US forces in the Steyr area on 8 May 1945. On 4 July (Independence Day) 1945, the United States flag was raised over Berlin for the first time at the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; barracks.

<text>Compass FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Immingham. Last owned by Bauer Radio, the station broadcast from 2001 to 2020, when it was subsumed by Greatest Hits Radio, as part of its Yorkshire region.

==Licence application==
Three applications were received by the Radio Authority by 5 September 2000, which also included the proposed Haven FM and Southbank FM, having been first advertised in May 2000. The licence for the station was awarded on 24 November 2000.

==Format==
Compass FM sat within its sister station&#x27;s (Lincs FM) TSA (Total Service Area), and the station&#x27;s format reflected this.

==Programming==
Compass FM provided 24/7 programming, some of which was automated (where the presenter&#x27;s links between the records are pre-recorded).

==Transmitter information==

The 96.4 FM signal, now used by Greatest Hits Radio, came from a low-powered transmitter on the roof of Bevan Flats in the East Marsh of Grimsby near the A180 until the building&#x27;s demolition in 2018. The transmitter is now located on the roof of the nearby Grimsby Telecoms Tower building.

==Awards==
Compass FM was the NTL Commercial Radio Station of the Year in 2003 (under 300,000 TSA).

==Merger with Greatest Hits Radio==
On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Compass FM, among other stations acquired when Bauer purchased the Lincs FM Group, would join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

In September 2020, the station rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio and merged with several other local stations. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained.

<doc id="979665" wikidata="Q865054" url="?curid=979665" title="Baggage">
<text>Baggage or luggage consists of bags, cases, and containers which hold a traveler&#x27;s personal articles while the traveler is in transit. A modern traveler can be expected to have packages containing clothing, toiletries, small possessions, trip necessities. On the return trip, travelers may have souvenirs and gifts. For some people, luggage and the style thereof is representative of the owner&#x27;s wealth and status. Luggage is constructed to protect the items during travel either with a hard shell or a durable soft material. Luggage often has internal subdivisions or sections to aid in securing items. Handles are typically provided to facilitate carrying, and some luggage may have wheels and/or telescoping handles or leashes to make moving them easier.

Baggage (not luggage), or &quot;baggage train&quot;, can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign.

==Overview==
Luggage has changed over time. Historically the most common types of luggage were chests or trunks made of wood or other heavy materials. These would be shipped by professional movers. Since the Second World War smaller and more lightweight suitcases and bags that can be carried by an individual have become the main form of luggage.

==Etymology==
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word &quot;baggage&quot; comes from the Old French (from &#x27;tie up&#x27;) or from &#x27;bundles&#x27;. It may also be related to the word &quot;bag&quot;.

Also according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word &quot;luggage&quot; originally meant inconveniently heavy baggage and comes from the verb &quot;lug&quot; and the suffix &quot;-age&quot;.

==Types==
* Trunk - A wooden box, generally much larger than other kinds of luggage. Trunks come in smaller sizes as in the case of footlockers and larger ones called steamers. These days trunks are more commonly used for storage than transportation. Items large enough to require a trunk are now usually shipped in transport cases. Some of the better known trunk makers are Louis Vuitton, Goyard, Moynat, M. M. Secor and Leatheroid. In the late 1600’s trunks were constructed in America. These trunks were assembled out of different kinds of wood and often covered with animal hides from horses, cows and deer. American made hide covered trunks grew in popularity in the 1700’s and started to become more adorned to enhance the appearance. This included adding leather trim, iron locks, brass tacks as well as handles to the trunks.
* Suitcase - A wheeled or non-wheeled luggage, as well as soft or hard side luggage.
* Train case - A smaller, box-like, handled case for personal grooming articles.
* Garment bag - A style of luggage that folds over on itself to allow long garments such as suits or dresses to be packed flat to avoid creasing. Garment bags come in both wheeled and non-wheeled models and are usually one of the largest pieces in any set of luggage
* Tote - A small bag, usually worn on the shoulder
* Duffle bag - A barrel-shaped bag, almost exclusively soft side, is well suited to casual travel, with little organization inside.
* Carpet bag - Travel luggage traditionally made from carpets.
* Packing cubes - Small rectangular bags of different sizes and different colors created to keep the contents of other baggage organized and compact
* Gate check bags - Bags specially designed to protect frequent gate checking items, such as strollers and car seats.

==Features==
* Locks - locks serve multiple purposes; a deterrent to dishonest airport workers and locks also help keep baggage closed during handling. Since 2003 most locks integrated into luggage use the TSA Lock standard developed by Travel Sentry to allow opening by the US Transportation Security Administration.
* Expandable luggage - suitcases that can be unzipped to expand for more packing space.

===Wheels===


Luggage carriers – light-weight wheeled carts on which luggage could be temporarily placed or that can be temporarily attached to luggage – date at least to the 1930s, such as in US patent 2,132,316 &quot;Luggage carrier&quot; by Anne W. Newton (filed 1937, published 1938). These were refined over the following decades, as reflected in patents such as a 1948 US patent by Herbert Ernest Mingo, for a &quot;device for the handling of trunks, suitcases, and the like&quot;.

A US patent for a &quot;luggage carriage&quot; filed in 1949 (and published 1953), and another for a &quot;luggage carriage harness&quot;, were both made by Kent R. Costikyan. However, the wheels were &quot;external&quot; to the suitcases. Patents had been published for wheeled luggage – a wheeled trunk in 1887, and a wheeled suitcase in 1945 – but these were not successfully commercialized.

The first rolling suitcase was invented by a French engineer, Maurice Partiot, who was living in the USA at that time. The patent was registered n° 2 463 713, March 8, 1949. But the application was not pursued by its inventor and the patent lapsed in 1967.

Bernard D. Sadow developed the first commercial rolling suitcase by applying for the rolling luggage patent, which was officially known as; United States patent 3,653,474 for &quot;Rolling Luggage&quot;, in 1970. Two years later in 1972 Bernard D. Sadow was given the wheeled suitcases patent, which became successful.

The patent application cited the increase in air travel, and &quot;baggage handling [having] become perhaps the single biggest difficulty encountered by an air passenger&quot;, as background of the invention.

Sadow&#x27;s four-wheeled suitcases, pulled using a loose strap, were later surpassed in popularity by suitcases that feature two wheels and are pulled in an upright position using a long handle. These were invented in 1987 by US pilot Robert Plath, and initially sold to crew members. Plath later commercialized them, after travelers became interested after seeing them in use by crew members, and founded the Travelpro company, which marketing the suitcases under the trademark &quot;Rollaboard&quot;. The terms &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are used generically, however. While initially designed for carry-on use (to navigate through a large terminal), as implied by the analogous name, similar designs are also used for checked baggage.

More recently, four-wheeled luggage with casters has become popular, notably since their use by Samsonite in the 2004 version of their signature &quot;Silhouette&quot; line. These are otherwise similar in design to two-wheel roll-aboards, with a vertical orientation and a retracting handle, but are designed to be pushed beside or in front of the traveler, rather than pulled behind them. These are often referred to as &quot;spinner&quot; luggage, since they can spin about their vertical axis.

Sadow attributes the late invention of luggage on wheels to a &quot;macho thing&quot; where &quot;men would not accept suitcases with wheels&quot;. Others attribute the late invention to &quot;the abundance of luggage porters with carts in the 1960s, the ease of curbside drop-offs at much smaller airports and the heavy iron casters then available.&quot;

==Hand/carry-on==
Passengers are allowed to carry a limited number of smaller bags with them in the vehicle, these are known as luggage (more commonly referred to as carry-on in North America), and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains often have luggage racks at the ends of the carriage near the doors, or above the seats if there are compartments. On aircraft, the size and weight of hand luggage is regulated, along with the number of bags. Some airlines charge for carry-on over a certain number.

==Smart==
Smart luggage is baggage that has a built-in or a removable battery within. It often includes features designed to help with travel, including GPS tracking and USB ports to charge electronics. Some bags include a WiFi hotspot and electric wheels for personal transportation.

Several smart luggage companies have shut down as a result of a ban which came into effect in January 2018 on smart luggage with non-removable batteries being carried as check-in luggage on flights.

==Claim and reclaim==
In airport terminals, a baggage claim or reclaim area is an area where arriving passengers claim checked-in baggage after disembarking from an airline flight. At most airports and many train stations, baggage is delivered to the passenger on a baggage carousel.

==Storage==
Left luggage, also luggage storage or bag storage, is a place where one can temporarily store one&#x27;s luggage so as to not have to carry it. Left luggage is not synonymous with lost luggage. Often at an airport or train station there may be a staffed &#x27;left luggage counter&#x27; or simply a coin-operated or automated locker system. While threats of terrorism all around the globe have caused this type of public storage to decrease over the past few decades, the sharing economy is causing a revival of the industry. Driven in part by the rapid growth of Airbnb and homestay traveling in general, a number of services offering short-term luggage storage by utilizing unused space at local businesses such as hotels, restaurants and retail shops have emerged.

==Military==
Baggage can also refer to the train of people and goods, both military and of a personal nature, which commonly followed pre-modern armies on campaign. The baggage was considered a strategic resource and guarded by a rear guard. Its loss was considered to weaken and demoralize an army, leading to rearguard attacks such as that at the Battle of Agincourt.

<text>Chester&#x27;s Dee Radio is an Independent Local Radio station serving the city of Chester and surrounding areas.

The station is independent and locally owned and broadcasts from studios at Riverside Innovation Centre.

As of March 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 12,000, according to RAJAR.

== History ==
The station launched, as Dee 106.3, on 1 March 2003 from its original studio premises at Chantry Court, Chester.

In June 2009, the station&#x27;s owners purchased a neighbouring local radio station, Silk 106.9, based in Macclesfield.

In March 2013, Dee 106.3 launched a second station, Dee on DAB, on the MuxCo DAB Digital Radio multiplex serving North East Wales and West Cheshire. This service is now a full-time simulcast of the main Dee Radio service.

In January 2020, the station rebranded as Dee Radio, de-emphasising its FM frequency and reflecting its position on both FM and digital radio platforms.

==Programming==
All of Dee Radio&#x27;s programming is produced and broadcast from its Chester studios. Live programming airs from 6am to 7pm during weekdays, 8am to 6pm on Saturdays and 10am to 2pm on Sundays. Other output is voice tracked or automated.

The station&#x27;s presenters include Gavin Matthews, Dave Phillips, Steve Lord, Ruth Anne Pollard, Darren Antrobus and Shane Pinnington.

===News and sport===
Dee Radio broadcasts hourly local news bulletins produced by Radio News Hub from 6am-6pm on weekdays and 10am-2pm at weekends. National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried every hour at all other times.

The station also airs weekly sports programming on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons, including regular coverage of Chester FC.

== Transmission ==
Dee Radio broadcasts on a frequency of 106.3 MHz from a transmission site atop the Steam Mill building in Chester city centre. The station is also available on DAB Digital Radio via the MuxCo North East Wales and West Cheshire multiplex, which is part-owned by Dee Radio.

<text>Dearne FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving Barnsley. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
The station was based at Zenith Park on Whaley Road, Barugh Green, in the north-west of Barnsley. As a result of cost cutting, Dearne FM co-located with sister stations Trax FM, Rother FM and Ridings FM at studios on White Rose Way in Doncaster. Five other companies competed for Barnsley&#x27;s FM radio licence.

==Transmitters==
The station was broadcast on 102.0 FM near Ardsley) in Barnsley and the Dearne Valley, and on 97.1 FM (near Hoylandswaine close to the A628 and A629 roundabout) for Penistone on &quot;Hunger Hill&quot;. The Ardsley transmitter also broadcast Hallam FM on 102.9 FM, with whom Dearne FM mainly competed. The 102 FM signal is more powerful than 97.1 FM, which is an off-air relay of 102 FM.

==Programming==
Dearne FM appealed to a family audience playing a mix of current chart hits and the best songs from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and today combined with local news, information and competitions.

<doc id="979677" wikidata="Q7894137" url="?curid=979677" title="Universal life insurance">
<text>Universal life insurance (often shortened to UL) is a type of cash value life insurance, sold primarily in the United States. Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy, which is credited each month with interest. The policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge as well as any other policy charges and fees drawn from the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month. Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an &quot;Indexed universal life&quot; contract. Such policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured&#x27;s lifetime at a substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first. The cost of insurance always increases, as is found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract). That not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs) since cash is of no consequence.

==Similar life insurance types==
A similar type of policy that was developed from universal life insurance is the &quot;variable universal life insurance&quot; policy (VUL). VUL lets the cash value be directed to a number of separate accounts that operate like mutual funds and can be invested in stock or bond investments with greater risk and potential growth. Additionally, there is the recent addition of &quot;indexed universal life&quot; contracts similar to equity-indexed annuities which credit interest linked to the positive movement of an index, such as the S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000, and the Dow Jones. Unlike VUL, the cash value of an Index UL policy generally has principal protection, less the costs of insurance and policy administrative fees. Index UL participation in the index may have a cap, margin, or other participation modifier, as well as a minimum guaranteed interest rate.

Universal life is similar in some ways to, and was developed from, &quot;whole life insurance&quot;, although the actual cost of insurance inside the UL policy is based on annually renewable term life insurance. The advantage of the universal life policy is its premium flexibility and adjustable death benefits. The death benefit can be increased (subject to insurability), or decreased at the policy owner&#x27;s request.

The premiums are flexible, from a minimum amount specified in the policy, to the maximum amount allowed by the contract. The primary difference is that the universal life policy shifts some of the risk for maintaining the death benefit to the policy owner. In a whole life policy, as long as every premium payment is made, the death benefit is guaranteed to the maturity date in the policy, usually age 95, or to age 121. A UL policy lapses when the cash value is no longer sufficient to cover the insurance and policy administrative expense.

To make UL policies more attractive, insurers have added secondary guarantees, where if certain minimum premium payments are made for a given period, the policy remains in force for the guaranteed period even if the cash value drops to zero. These are commonly called &quot;no lapse guarantee&quot; riders, and the product is commonly called &quot;guaranteed universal life&quot; (GUL, not to be confused with &quot;group universal life insurance&quot;, which is also typically shortened to GUL).

The trend up until 2007–2008 was to reduce premiums on GUL to the point where there was virtually no cash surrender values at all, essentially creating a level term policy that could last to age 121. Since then, many companies have introduced either a second GUL policy that has a slightly higher premium, but in return the policy owner has cash surrender values that show a better internal rate of return on surrender than the additional premiums could earn in a risk-free investment outside of the policy.

With the requirement for all new policies to use the latest mortality table (CSO 2001) beginning January 1, 2004, many GUL policies have been repriced, and the general trend is toward slight premium increases compared to the policies from 2008.

Another major difference between universal life and whole life insurances: the administrative expenses and cost of insurance within a universal life contract are transparent to the policy owner, whereas the assumptions the insurance company uses to determine the premium for a whole life insurance policy are not transparent.

==Uses of universal life insurance==
*Final expenses, such as a funeral, burial, and unpaid medical bills
*Income replacement, to provide for surviving spouses and dependent children
*Debt coverage, to pay off personal and business debts, such as a home mortgage or business operating loan
*Estate liquidity, when an estate has an immediate need for cash to settle federal estate taxes, state inheritance taxes, or unpaid income taxes on income in respect of a decedent (IRD)
*Estate replacement, when an insured has donated assets to a charity and wants to replace the value with cash death benefits
*Business succession &amp; continuity, for example to fund a cross-purchase or stock redemption buy/sell agreement
*Key person insurance, to protect a company from the economic loss incurred when a key employee or manager dies
*Executive bonus, under IRC Sec. 162, where an employer pays the premium on a life insurance policy owned by a key person. The employer deducts the premium as an ordinary business expense, and the employee pays the income tax on the premium
*Controlled executive bonus, just like above, but with an additional contract between an employee and employer that effectively limits the employee&#x27;s access to cash values for a period of time (golden handcuffs)
*Split dollar plans, where the death benefits, cash surrender values, and premium payments are split between an employer and employee, or between an individual and a non-natural person (e.g. trust)
*Non-qualified deferred compensation, as an informal funding vehicle where a corporation owns the policy, pays the premiums, receives the benefits, and then uses them to pay, in whole or in part, a contractual promise to pay retirement benefits to a key person, or survivor benefits to the deceased key person&#x27;s beneficiaries
*An alternative to long-term care insurance, where new policies have accelerated benefits for Long Term Care
*Mortgage acceleration, where an over-funded UL policy is either surrendered or borrowed against to pay off a home mortgage
*Life insurance retirement plan, or Roth IRA alternative. Traditional IRA and 401(k) contributions get an income tax deduction but, in exchange for this deduction, every dollar distributed gets taxed as if it were salary or wages. People who prioritize having a source of tax-free funds in retirement over a current tax deduction may do well to evaluate Roth plans and life insurance as an alternative. Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s, and cash value life insurance share features that make life insurance a viable option to supplement or replace Roth retirement plans. All three have these attributes: (1) contributions are paid with after-tax dollars (no income tax deduction), (2) the growth is not taxed, and (3) they may serve as a source of tax-free money. Roth IRAs are tax-free with two exceptions: distributions become subject to taxes and penalties if the account is owned less than 5 years or when made to someone under age 59 ½. Neither limitation applies to life insurance. Also, not everyone may use a Roth IRA. The IRS restricts participation based on annual income. Some people who want to contribute may not be able to. Life insurance contracts have no such restrictions. Contributions to cash value life insurance contracts may be withdrawn tax-free, and the gains in the contract may be accessed tax-free through policy loans. Typically, no interest or principal payments are made until the death of the insured, when the entirety of the loan is repaid in a lump sum using a portion of the death benefit proceeds. People should compare projections of after-tax retirement income when evaluating Cash Value life insurance and Traditional and Roth plans to assess which maximizes after-tax income in retirement
*Term life insurance alternative, for example when a policy owner wants to use interest income from a lump sum of cash to pay a term life insurance premium. An alternative is to use the lump sum to pay premiums into a UL policy on a single premium or limited premium basis, creating tax arbitrage when the costs of insurance are paid from untaxed excess interest credits, which may be crediting at a higher rate than other guaranteed, no risk asset classes (e.g. U.S. Treasury Bonds or U.S. Savings Bonds)
*Whole life insurance alternative, where there is a need for permanent death benefits, but little or no need for cash surrender values, then a current assumption UL or GUL may be an appropriate alternative, with potentially lower net premiums
*Annuity alternative, when a policy owner has a lump sum of cash that they intend to leave to the next generation, a single premium UL policy provides similar benefits during life, but has a stepped up death benefit that is income tax-free
*Pension maximization, where permanent death benefits are needed so an employee can elect the highest retirement income option from a defined benefit pension
*Annuity maximization, where a large non-qualified annuity with a low cost basis is no longer needed for retirement and the policy owner wants to maximize the value for the next generation. There is potential for arbitrage when the annuity is exchanged for a single premium immediate annuity (SPIA), and the proceeds of the SPIA are used to fund a permanent death benefit using Universal Life. This arbitrage is magnified at older ages, and when a medical impairment can produce substantially higher payments from a medically underwritten SPIA
*RMD maximization, where an IRA owner is facing required minimum distributions (RMD), but has no need for current income, and desires to leave the IRA for heirs. The IRA is used to purchase a qualified SPIA that maximizes the current income from the IRA, and this income is used to purchase a UL policy
*Creditor/predator protection. A person who earns a high income, or who has a high net worth, and who practices a profession that suffers a high risk from predation by litigation, may benefit from using UL as a warehouse for cash, because in some states the policies enjoy protection from the claims of creditors, including judgments from lawsuits

==Living benefits of life insurance==
Many people use life insurance, and in particular cash value life insurance, as a source of benefits to the owner of the policy (as opposed to the death benefit, which provides benefit to the beneficiary). These benefits include loans, withdrawals, collateral assignments, split dollar agreements, pension funding, and tax planning.

===Loans===
Most universal life policies come with an option to take a loan on certain values associated with the policy. These loans require interest payments to the insurance company. The insurer charges interest on the loan because they are no longer able to receive any investment benefit from the money they lent to the policy holder.

Participating loans are generally associated with certain Index Universal Life policies. Since these policies will never incur a loss on the investment portion due to hedging, participating loans are secured by the policy&#x27;s Account Value, and allow whatever index strategy that was in place prior to creating the loan to remain in place and unaffected as to whatever index return is realized. Standard loans require conversion of any ongoing index allocations to be terminated, and an amount at least equal to the loan moved into the policy&#x27;s Fixed Account.

Repayment of the loan principal is not required, but payment of the loan interest is required. If the loan interest is not paid, it is deducted from the cash value of the policy. If there is not sufficient value in the policy to cover interest, the policy lapses.

Loans are not reported to any credit agency, and payment or non-payment against them doesn&#x27;t affect the policyholder&#x27;s credit rating. If the policy has not become a &quot;modified endowment&quot;, the loans are withdrawn from the policy values as premium first and then any gain. Taking Loans on UL affects the long-term viability of the plan. The cash values removed by loan are no longer earning the interest expected, so the cash values don&#x27;t grow as expected. This shortens the life of the policy. Usually those loans cause a greater than expected premium payment as well as interest payments.

Outstanding loans are deducted from the death benefit at the death of the insured.
===Withdrawals===
If done within IRS Regulations, an Equity Indexed Universal Life policy can provide income that is tax-free. This is done through withdrawals that do not exceed the total premium payments made into the policy. Also, tax-free withdrawals can be made through internal policy loans offered by the insurance company, against any additional cash value within the policy. (This income can exceed policy premiums and still be taken 100% tax-free.) If the policy is set up, funded and distributed properly, according to IRS regulations, an Equity Indexed UL policy can provide an investor with many years of tax-free income.

Most universal life policies come with an option to withdraw cash values rather than take a loan. The withdrawals are subject to contingent deferred sales charges and may also have additional fees defined by the contract. Withdrawals permanently lower the death benefit of the contract at the time of the withdrawal.

Withdrawals are taken out premiums first and then gains, so it is possible to take a tax-free withdrawal from the values of the policy (this assumes the policy is not an MEC, i.e. &quot;modified endowment contract&quot;). Withdrawals are considered a material change that causes the policy to be tested for MEC. As a result of a withdrawal, the policy may become a MEC and could lose its tax advantages.

Withdrawing values affect the long-term viability of the plan. The cash values removed by withdrawal are no longer earning the interest expected, so the cash values don&#x27;t grow as expected. To some extent this issue is mitigated by the corresponding lower death benefit.
===Collateral assignments===
Collateral assignments are often placed on life insurance to guarantee the loan upon the death of debtor. If a collateral assignment is placed on life insurance, the assignee receives any amount due to them before the beneficiary is paid. If there is more than one assignee, the assignees are paid based on date of the assignment, i.e., the earlier assignment date gets paid before the later assignment date.

==Types==

===Single premium===
A Single Premium UL is paid for by a single, substantial, initial payment. Some policies contractually forbid any more than the one premium, and some policies are casually defined as single-premium for that reason. The policy remains in force so long as the COI charges have not depleted the account. These policies were very popular prior to 1988, as life insurance is generally a tax deferred plan, and so interest earned in the policy was not taxable as long as it remained in the policy. Further withdrawals from the policy were taken out principal first, rather than gain first and so tax free withdrawals of at least some portion of the value were an option.
In 1988 changes were made in the tax code, and single premium policies purchased after were &quot;modified endowment contract&quot; (MEC) and subject to less advantageous tax treatment. Policies purchased before the change in code are not subject to the new tax law unless they have a &quot;material change&quot; in the policy (usually this is a change in death benefit or risk). It is important to note that a MEC is determined by total premiums paid in a 7-year period, and not by single payment. The IRS defines the method of testing whether a life insurance policy is a MEC. At any point in the life of a policy, a premium or a material change to the policy could cause it to lose its tax advantage and become a MEC.

In a MEC, premiums and accumulation are taxed like an annuity on withdrawing. The accumulations grow tax deferred and still transfer tax free to the beneficiary under Internal Revenue Service Code 101a under certain circumstances.

===Fixed premium===
Fixed Premium UL is paid for by periodic premium payments associated with a no lapse guarantee in the policy. Sometimes the guarantees are part of the base policy and sometimes the guarantee is an additional rider to the policy. Generally these payments are for a shorter time than the policy is in force. For example, payments may be made for 10 years, with the intention that thereafter the policy is paid-up. But it can also be permanent fixed payment for the life of policy.

Since the base policy is inherently based on cash value, the fixed premium policy only works if it is tied to a guarantee. If the guarantee is lost, the policy reverts to it flexible premium status. And if the guarantee is lost, the planned premium may no longer be sufficient to keep the coverage active. If the experience of the plan is not as good as predicted, the account value at the end of the premium period may not be adequate to continue the policy as originally written. In this case, the policyholder may have the choice to either:
# Leave the policy alone, and let it potentially expire early (if COI charges deplete the account), or
# Make additional or higher premium payments, to keep the death benefit level, or
# Lower the death benefit.

Many universal life contracts taken out in the high interest periods of the 1970s and 1980s faced this situation and lapsed when the premiums paid were not enough to cover the cost of insurance.

===Flexible premium===
Flexible Premium UL allows the policyholder to vary their premiums within certain limits. Inherently UL policies are flexible premium, but each variation in payment has a long-term effect that must be considered. To remain active, the policy must have sufficient available cash value to pay for the cost of insurance. Higher than expected payments could be required if the policyholder has skipped payments or has been paying less than originally planned. It is recommended that yearly illustrative projections be requested from the insurer so that future payments and outcomes can be planned.

In addition, Flexible Premium UL may offer a number of different death benefit options, which typically include at least the following:
* a level death benefit (often called &quot;Option A&quot; or &quot;Option 1&quot;, &quot;Type 1&quot;, etc.), or
* a level amount at risk (often called &quot;Option B&quot;, etc.); this is also referred to as an increasing death benefit.

Policyholders may also buy Flexible Premium UL with a large initial deposit, thereafter making payments irregularly.

==Criticism==

===Misleadingly sold as an investment===
In the US, it is illegal under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to offer Universal Life Insurance as an &quot;investment&quot; to individuals, but it is frequently offered by agents as a tax-advantaged financial vehicle from which they can borrow as needed later without tax penalties. This also makes it an alternative for wealthy individuals who are not able to contribute to a Roth IRA due to IRS income restraints.

It is illegal to market Index Universal Life (IUL) as an &quot;investment security&quot;, as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 &amp; the Securities Act of 1934. These Acts of Congress gave birth to the SEC, in reaction to the stock market crash of 1929 that preceded the Great Depression. Today, the SEC oversees FINRA and they both regulate the marketing and sale of securities. IUL is an insurance product and does not meet the definition of a security, so it does not fall under the authority of the SEC or FINRA.

Therefore, under the authority of the SEC and FINRA, Index Universal Life Insurance cannot be marketed or sold as a &quot;security&quot;, &quot;variable security&quot;, &quot;variable investment&quot; or direct investment in a &quot;security&quot; (or the stock market), because it is not. However, IUL can be marketed and sold as an investment.

===High commissions, conflict of interest===
Agents receive higher commissions for selling universal and other whole life policies than they do for selling less expensive term life insurance, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.

Proponents respond that it would be inaccurate to state that term insurance is less expensive than universal life, or for that matter, other forms of permanent life insurance, without qualifying the statement with the other factor: time, or length of coverage.

While term life insurance is the least expensive over a short period, say one to twenty years, permanent life insurance is generally the least expensive over a longer period, or over one&#x27;s entire lifetime. This is mainly due to the high percentage of the premiums paid out in commissions during the first 10–12 years.

===Misunderstood risk to policyholders===
Interest rate risk: UL is a complex policy with risk to the policyholder. Its flexible premiums include a risk that the policyholder may have to pay a greater than planned premium to maintain the policy. This can happen if the expected interest paid on the accumulated values is less than originally assumed at purchase. This happened to many policyholders who purchased their policies in the mid-1980s when interest rates were very high. As the interest rates lowered, the policy did not earn as expected and the policyholder was forced to pay more to maintain the policy. If any form of loan is taken on the policy, this may cause the policyholder to pay a greater than expected premium, because the loaned values are no longer in the policy to earn for the policyholder. If the policyholder skips payments or makes late payments, they may have to make that up in later years by making larger than expected payments. Market factors relating to the 2008 stock market crash adversely affected many policies by increasing premiums, decreasing benefit, or decreasing the term of coverage. On the other hand, many older policies (especially well-funded ones) benefit from the unusually high interest guarantees of 4% or 4.5%, which are common for policies issued prior to 2000. Policies from that era may benefit from voluntary increases in premium, which capture these artificially high rates.

No-lapse guarantees, or death benefit guarantees: A well informed policyholder should understand that the flexibility of the policy is tied irrevocably to risk to the policyholder. The more guarantees a policy has, the more expensive its cost. And with UL, many of the guarantees are tied to an expected premium stream. If the premium is not paid on time, the guarantee may be lost and cannot be reinstated. For example, some policies offer a &quot;no lapse&quot; guarantee, which states that if a stated premium is paid in a timely manner, the coverage remains in force, even if there is not sufficient cash value to cover the mortality expenses. It is important to distinguish between this no lapse guarantee and the actual death benefit coverage. The death benefit coverage is paid for by mortality charges (also called cost of insurance). As long as these charges can be deducted from the cash value, the death benefit is active. The &quot;no lapse&quot; guarantee is a safety net that provides for coverage in the event that the cash value isn&#x27;t large enough to cover the charges. This guarantee is lost if the policyholder does not make the premium as agreed, although the coverage itself may still be in force. Some policies do not provide for the possibility of reinstating this guarantee. Sometimes the cost associated with the guarantee is still deducted even if the guarantee itself is lost (those fees are often built into the cost of insurance and the costs don&#x27;t change when the guarantee is lost). Some policies provide an option for reinstating the guarantee within certain time frames and/or with additional premiums (usually catching up the deficit of premiums and an associated interest). No-lapse guarantees can also be lost when loans or withdrawals are taken against the cash values.

===Use as a tax haven===
The product is increasingly being used by wealthy individuals as a way to avoid income and estate taxes rather than serving as insurance.

==Miscellaneous==
The single largest asset class of all but one of the largest banks in the United States is permanent cash value life insurance, commonly referred to as BOLI, or Bank Owned Life Insurance. During the recent economic crisis, banks accelerated their purchasing of BOLI as it was the single most secure investment they could make. One banker described BOLI as a &quot;constantly resetting municipal bond that I never have to mark to market.&quot; The majority of BOLI is current assumption Universal Life, usually sold as a single premium contract.

<doc id="979683" wikidata="Q2117506" url="?curid=979683" title="Digicel">
<text>Digicel is a Jamaican-based Caribbean mobile phone network and home entertainment provider operating in 25 markets worldwide.

Digicel has operated in several countries, including Guyana, Fiji, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Samoa, St. Lucia, Suriname, and Jamaica. In 2024 a group of U.S. private equity firms took over control of the company as part of debt restructuring.

==History==
Digicel was founded in 2001 by Irish entrepreneur Denis O&#x27;Brien. The company launched in April 2001 in Jamaica. In March 2003, Digicel expanded to St. Lucia and St. Vincent. In 2005, Digicel purchased Cingular Wireless’ Caribbean and Bermudan operations.

In April 2006, Digicel launched its services in Trinidad and Tobago. In May 2006, Digicel began operations in Haïti. Between 2006 and 2008, Digicel expanded into the Central American mainland, as well as the Pacific. In September 2006, it acquired an unrelated mobile phone provider: Digicel Holdings in El Salvador.

In 2007, Digicel acquired U*Mobile in Guyana, and launched in Suriname in December.

=== OUR court rulings ===
In April 2002, Digicel received permission from Jamaica&#x27;s then-minister of industry, commerce and technology, Phillip Paulwell, to disregard the interconnectivity fee ceiling issued by the Offices of Utilities Regulation (OUR). Following a judicial review, it was determined that Paulwell did not have the power to make this decision. Digicel appealed the ruling to the Jamaican Supreme Court in 2003 and won. OUR appealed the decision to the appellate court, which ruled Paulwell&#x27;s decision was outside his powers and OUR didn&#x27;t have to comply with Paulwell&#x27;s directive. Digicel appealed to the Privy Council, Jamaica&#x27;s final court of appeal, which upheld the appellate court&#x27;s decision in 2007.

Digicel appealed the decision to the United Kingdom Privy Council. In January 2010, the Council ruled in favour of the OUR, meaning LIME (formerly Cable &amp; Wireless Jamaica) was allowed to keep the J$340 million Digicel had been ordered to pay them by the Jamaican courts. In 2015, LIME&#x27;s parent company acquired Columbus Communications and decided to adopt the brand name FLOW for its consumer-facing business, replacing the LIME name. As of May 2016, the LIME name was fully discontinued.

=== 2010–present ===
Digicel Mobile Money, a mobile banking service, was launched in Fiji in July 2010. Also in 2010, Digicel launched TchoTcho, a cash app for money transfers to phones in Haiti. In 2011, Mobile Money in Fiji was expanded to allow transfers to and from Australia and New Zealand at no cost.

In February 2011, Digicel took a controlling stake in Netxar Technologies, a leading systems integrator in the Caribbean region. In March, Digicel announced that it was selling its operations in Honduras and El Salvador to Mexican telecom company América Móvil, and América Móvil was selling its operations in Jamaica to Digicel. In March 2012, Digicel acquired Comcel/Voila, its main competitor in Haiti.

In May 2012, the Tax Authority Jamaica (TAJ) visited Digicel&#x27;s offices in New Kingston with an order from the Jamaican Supreme Court to look for data regarding the company&#x27;s payment of the general consumption tax. A couple of weeks later, TAJ and Digicel agreed to have more dialogue surrounding the situation.

In October 2012, América Móvil announced it wouldn&#x27;t acquire Digicel&#x27;s operations in El Salvador.

In June 2013, Digicel announced that it would invest $9 billion in a mobile phone network in Myanmar, if granted a licence. However, Digicel lost the licence bid to Telenor and Ooredoo.

Digicel acquired SAT Telecom, a cable and internet company in Dominica, in February 2014 and relaunched the brand as Digicel Play in October of that year. In September, Digicel acquired Telstar Cable Limited in Jamaica.

In 2015, TchoTcho was relaunched as MonCash with additional banking services. In September 2016, Digicel Play launched as Play Go, a live streaming service.

In July 2017, Digicel bought 16.6% of Tonga Cable from the government.

In January 2019, O&#x27;Brien named Jean-Yves Charlier as chief executive, replacing Michael Willner. Jean-Yves stepped down as the Group CEO of Digicel in July 2020, and Oliver Coughlin was named the CEO for Digicel&#x27;s Caribbean and Latin American business.

In May 2020, Digicel announced plans to restructure its debt. The restructuring plan was approved by Digicel&#x27;s bondholders and completed in June 2020. As part of the exchange, O&#x27;Brien contributed $50 million in assets to Digicel, consisting of the company&#x27;s Jamaican headquarters and $25 million in cash.

In November 2020, Digicel announced that, in its financial second quarter to the end of September, its earnings have dropped due to impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2021, Digicel announced the sale of its Pacific operations to Telstra Group, an Australian telecommunications company. The sale was estimated at US$1.6 billion. However this was thrown into doubt in March 2022 when the Papua New Guinea government imposed a retrospective tax of over $100m on the company.

In September 2022, credit rating service Fitch issued a warning of a potential debt default. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; suggested &quot;there&#x27;s little or no equity value in Digicel to chase&quot;.

On September 11, 2023, Digicel Group filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.

On November 29, 2023. Rajeev Suri was appointed as the new Chairman of Digicel Group. 

On April 20, 2024, Digicel ceased operations in Panama after failing to award the tender to operate and exploit the personal communications service, after the bidding process concluded without award due to the withdrawal of the only interested company.

Digicel&#x27;s exit from the Panamanian market occurred in a context of significant changes in the country&#x27;s telecommunications sector, including the merger of Cable &amp; Wireless Panama and Claro Panama, which reduced the number of main operators in the market.

Following the announcement, Digicel asked its customers to switch to another network within 30 days from March 20, 2024 to retain their phone numbers.
==Corporate sponsorship==
Digicel is a sponsor of Caribbean, Central American and Asia-Pacific sports teams, including the Special Olympics teams in these regions. From 2005 to 2018, Digicel sponsored The West Indies cricket team.

In April 2013, Digicel was announced as the first global sponsor of the 2013 inaugural tournament for the Caribbean Premier League.

In 2021, Digicel sponsored the PlayGo Emerge Competition for short films made in the Caribbean.

=== Digicel Foundation ===
In 2004, Digicel and its shareholders set up the Digicel Foundation in Jamaica.

<text>Sir John Maunsell ( 1190/1195 – 1265), Provost of Beverley Minster, was a king&#x27;s clerk and a judge. He served as chancellor to King Henry III and was England&#x27;s first secretary of state.

==Life==
His grandfather, Robert Mansel, was a Templar under Baron Gilbert de Lacy in Palestine. Robert led a small force of Welsh and Aquitanians by night to put to rout a much larger force of Turks under Sultan Nur ad-Din Zangi, at his camp outside Damascus during the reign of King Henry II. His father, Walter, a deacon, was Napkin Bearer to the King. John Maunsell is first heard of when he was sent from Scotland as orator from Alexander, King of Scotland in 1215 to the court of John. As the son of a deacon under orders, his birth status periodically came into question eventually resulting in a letter from Pope Innocent IV ratified by Pope Alexander IV in 1259 stating &quot;Approbation, addressed to John Mansel, Chancellor of London, the King&#x27;s Clerk, of the dispensation given to him, at the King&#x27;s request, by Pope Innocent, to be ordained and promoted, notwithstanding that his mother married his father, a man of noble birth, not knowing that he was a deacon, and was accounted for the time being his lawful wife; his father, after some time, repenting, resumed his orders, a divorce having been declared by their diocesan. The dispensation is approved, even if his mother&#x27;s plea of ignorance and the reputation of a lawful marriage cannot be sustained.&quot;

Maunsell became a favorite of the young King Henry III and was appointed to the vacant prebend of Thame by Henry, but Robert Grosseteste, a reforming bishop with strong feelings about ecclesiastical rights and privileges, refused to admit him. Reportedly, Maunsell took the Thame church by force before giving up his claim to the prebend (a specific type of benefice). Grosseteste, having thus vindicated his right, bestowed upon Maunsell the more lucrative benefice of Maidstone. Despite the loss of the Thame benefice, Maunsell probably obtained more benefices than any other contemporary clergyman as he amassed his plurality. Maunsell&#x27;s benefices included the livings of Haughley, Howden and Bawburgh and prebends of Tottenhall, South Malling and Chichester. He was also Provost of Beverley (1247), Chancellor of St. Paul&#x27;s, London, Dean of Wimborn, Rector of Wigan, Papal chaplain, and King&#x27;s chaplain.

He fought with a contingent of English under Henry de Turbeville in the aid of Frederick II, King of Germany in the north of Italy in 1238. Frederick II was married to Henry&#x27;s sister Isabella in 1235. He fought alongside Henry III in the Battle of Taillebourg during the Saintonge War (20–24 July 1242) and took Peter Orige, seneschal of the Count of Boulogne, prisoner. He was reckoned not least among brave men in this unsuccessful venture against Louis IX of France. He was seriously wounded while leading an assault in siege of the Verines monastery.

During 1246 and 1247 he served as Lord Chancellor of England.

John Maunsell established the Augustinian priory at Bilsington, near Romney in 1253 prudently reflecting that &quot;the king&#x27;s favour is not hereditary or worldly prosperity of lasting duration.&quot; He is however spoken of disparagingly by the chronicling monk Matthew Paris, of St Albans Abbey, for unfairly denying legal judgment in the Abbey&#x27;s favour after a monk had been attacked and robbed by his protégé Geoffrey of Childwick.

He enjoyed great secular power; the 1258 Provisions of Oxford gave four men the power to elect a council of fifteen to govern the treasury and the chancery. These four men were the Earl Marshal (the Earl of Norfolk), Hugh Bigod, John Maunsell, and the Earl of Warwick (John du Plessis). Not only did he arrange the marriage of Henry III daughter, Margaret of England to Alexander III of Scotland in 1249, but he entertained the courts of England and Scotland on King Alexander&#x27;s visit to London in 1256. Such a feat would not have been possible but for the income from his pluralities. He was named Seneschal of Gascony in 1243 a post later held by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and subsequently by Prince Edward. Alfonso of Castile had his eyes on Gascony and John Maunsell helped to defuse the situation by arranging the marriage of Edward to Alfonso&#x27;s half-sister, Eleanor in 1254. Sedgwick castle came into his hands in 1249. In 1261 he was named Constable of the Tower of London. He was mediator along with Simon de Montfort in arranging the marriage of Henry&#x27;s daughter Beatrice with John of Brittany in 1259. John Maunsell was in France with Queen Eleanor and Edmund when Simon de Montfort vanquished Henry III at the Battle of Lewes, 14 May 1264. Shortly thereafter, Simon de Montfort took possession of Maunsell&#x27;s estates in August 1264. John Maunsell died 20 January 1265 in Florence and was buried in York Minster. Among his contemporaries were the better known Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and Roger Bacon.

==Family and issue==
Burke held that Maunsell married Joan, daughter of Simon de Beauchamp of Bedford, and had the following issue:
*Thomas Maunsell
*William Maunsell
*Henry Maunsell

However, Maunsell was in major orders, making marriage unlikely. Furthermore, he left property not to these supposed male heirs, but to his sister and niece, the rest of his estate reverting to the Crown.

<text>Militaria, also known as military memorabilia, are military equipment which are collected for their historical significance. Such items include firearms, swords, sabres, knives, bayonets, helmets and other equipment such as uniforms, military orders and decorations and insignia.

The act of collecting militaria has roots in souvenir hunting, a practice first made popular among soldiers during World War I. During the war, soldiers would walk through battlefields and trenches, taking military equipment and personal items from enemy POW&#x27;s or, in most cases, dead bodies. Soldiers would send these items home to loved ones through post or in their belongings upon going home. Militaria collecting became nationalized during and at the end of World War I, through the 1917–1918 War Bonds Drive and the 1919 Victory Loan Drive. Captured German Pickelhauben, Stahlhelme, and other military equipment were showcased around the country as war trophies, some later being distributed to purchasers of bonds.

<text>The Świętokrzyskie Mountains (, ), often anglicized to Holy Cross Mountains, are a mountain range in central Poland, near the city of Kielce. 

The mountain range comprises several lesser ranges, the highest of which is Łysogóry (literally &quot;Bald Mountains&quot;).

The two highest peaks are Łysica, 614 m (2014.44 ft), and Łysa Góra, 594 m (1948.81 ft).

Together with the Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska and some other regions, the mountains form a region called the Lesser-Poland Upland (&quot;Wyżyna Małopolska&quot;). Geologically speaking, the Holy Cross Mountains possess also a margin which extends further than the mountains themselves; the Owadów–Brzezinki palaeontological site is situated in the margin of the Holy Cross Mountains, but not in the mountains themselves.

They cover an area of 1684 km2 (650 mi2).

The approximate location is .

==Prehistory==

The Świętokrzyskie Mountains are one of the oldest mountain ranges in Europe. They were formed during the Caledonian orogeny of the Silurian period and then rejuvenated in the Hercynian orogeny of the Late Carboniferous period.

The region was once on the southern coast of the ancient supercontinent of Laurasia. The oldest known evidence of tetrapods comes from 395-million-year old fossil footprints found in Zachełmie. The rocks were formed from a marine tidal flat or lagoon.

The mountains have also yielded the oldest evidence of Dinosauromorpha, pushing back the evolution of dinosaurs to small, four-legged animals living during the Early Triassic period. The fossil footprints date to some 250 million years ago, only a couple of million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event, during a time when the environment was still destabilized. Footprints of early bipedal dinosaurs known as &quot;Sphingopus&quot;, from 246 million years ago, have also been found.

==History==

From the early Middle Ages the mountains were a place of extensive copper and iron mining. Later they were also a significant site of limestone and red sandstone extraction. The central part of the mountains now contains the Świętokrzyski National Park.

The name &quot;&quot;Holy Cross&quot; Mountains&quot; refers to a Christian relic from a nearby Benedictine monastery on Łysa Góra, said to be a small piece of wood from the Cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified.

The region saw some significant partisan activity during World War II (see Detached Unit of the Polish Army, Holy Cross Mountains Brigade).

== Climate ==
The climate of the Świętokrzyskie Mountains differs from the surrounding regions. The average annual temperature is 6–7 °C. The yearly rainfall ranges from 650 to 900mm. The highest peaks are covered in snow from November to April. The ice sheet persist on average 50–90 days a year. The vegetation period of the highest parts of the mountains is two weeks shorter than in Warsaw and is about 200 days. Temperature inversion occurs – the temperature on the heated slopes can be up to 5 °C higher than in the bottoms of the valleys, located several dozen meters below.

== Nature conservation ==
In order to protect unique values of Świętokrzyskie Mountains Świętokrzyski National Park was established in 1950. Moreover, many areas are protected by several nature parks, reserves and Natura 2000 areas.

Nature parks in Świętokrzyskie mountains:

* Jeleniowska Landscape Park
* Cisów-Orłowiny Landscape Park
* Suchedniów-Oblęgorek Landscape Park
* Sieradowice Landscape Park
* Chęciny-Kielce Landscape Park

<doc id="979725" wikidata="Q975775" url="?curid=979725" title="Monte Verde">
<text>Monte Verde is a Paleolithic archaeological site in the Llanquihue Province in southern Chile, located near Puerto Montt, Los Lagos Region. The site is primarily known for Monte Verde II, dating to approximately 14,550–14,500 calibrated years Before Present (BP). The Monte Verde II site has been considered key evidence showing that the human settlement of the Americas pre-dates the Clovis culture by at least 1,000 years. This contradicts the previously accepted &quot;Clovis first&quot; model which holds that settlement of the Americas began after 13,500 cal BP. The Monte Verde findings were initially dismissed by most of the scientific community, but the evidence then became more accepted in archaeological circles. The site also contains an older, much more controversial layer (Monte Verde I) suggested to date to 18,500 cal BP (16,500 BC), that lacks the general acceptance of Monte Verde II. 

Monte Verde II represents a campsite with wooden tent-like structures that was later covered by a bog, sealing the site under a layer of anerobic peat. The occupants of the site made rope and utilized animal skins, and consumed a variety of plant foods, including seaweed (despite the site being from the ocean at the time), tubers, seeds, fruits and nuts. Remains at the site show that the occupants also butchered now extinct megafauna, including the gomphothere (elephant-relative) &quot;Notiomastodon&quot; and the llama &quot;Palaeolama&quot;.

Paleoecological evidence of the coastal landscape&#x27;s ability to sustain human life further supports a &quot;coastal migration&quot; model. Dating of rock surfaces and animal bones suggests the coastal corridor was deglaciated and became habitable after 17,000 years BP. Although testing coastal migration theories can be difficult due to sea level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum, archaeologists are increasingly willing to accept the possibility that the initial settlement of the Americas occurred via coastlines.

==History==

===Discovery===
The site was discovered in late 1975 when a veterinary student visited the area of Monte Verde, where severe erosion was occurring due to logging. Prior to the logging, the site itself had been preserved well due to the favorable conditions created by the Chinchihuapi creek banks. The student was shown a strange &quot;cow bone&quot; collected by nearby farmers who had found it exposed in the eroded Chinchihuapi Creek. The bone later proved to be from &quot;Notiomastodon,&quot; a gomphothere related to modern elephants. Tom Dillehay, an American anthropologist and professor at the Universidad Austral de Chile at the time, started excavating Monte Verde in 1977.

The site is situated on the banks of Chinchihuapi Creek, a tributary of the Maullín River located from the Pacific Ocean. One of the rare open-air prehistoric sites found so far in the Americas, Monte Verde was well preserved because it was located in an anaerobic bog environment near the creek. A short time after the site was originally occupied, the waters of the creek rose and a peat-filled bog formed that inhibited the bacterial decay of organic material and preserved many perishable artifacts and other items for millennia.

Radiocarbon dating of bones and charcoal in 1982 gave the site an average age of 14,800 BP (calibrated), more than 1,000 years earlier than the oldest-known site of human habitation in the Americas at that time.

In the initial excavation, two large hearths and many small ones were found. The remains of local animals were discovered, in addition to wooden posts from approximately twelve huts. Scraps of clothing made of hide were also found. This led archaeologists to estimate the population was around 20–30 inhabitants. A human footprint was also observed in the clay, probably from a adult.

=== Stratigraphy ===
The area consists of four distinct sites, Monte Verde I, Monte Verde II, Chinchihuapi I, and Chinchihuapi II.

The Monte Verde site has two distinct levels. The upper level, MV-II, has been extensively characterized. Its occupation is reliably dated to sometime between 14,800 – 13,800 BP. 

The lower level, MV-I, is less well understood. It was more ephemeral, having come from ancient river sediments. Dillehay found charcoal scatters which may have been the remains of fireplaces next to stone and wood artifacts. These were dated to at least 33,000BP. He acknowledges MV-I has issues, such as uncertain artifacts, doubtful radiocarbon dates, and unreliable contexts. He hesistates to accept this level without additional evidence, including sites of similar age in the Americas.

==== Monte Verde I (MV-I) ====
Monte Verde I is located under an outwash plain, which formed during the last glaciation. It is not directly below MV-II. It was first concluded to be a site of human occupation because of three clay-lined burned areas and 26 stones, 13 of which may have been modified by humans. In 2013, Dillehay and his team returned to perform another excavation at Monte Verde due to the inadequate previous excavations. In 2015, Monte Verde I was re-dated to around 18,500 to 14,500 BP. Charcoal remains, charred animal bone fragments and several lithic artifacts, about 34% of which were derived from non-local sources, were discovered. The older end of this range is controversial, however, as it is based on putative lithic tools which some have suggested are instead naturally occurring objects.

==== Monte Verde II (MV-II) ====
According to the most recent studies by Dillehay and Pino, Monte Verde II has been dated to around 14,550 calibrated years Before Present.

The site is suggested to have been occupied by about twenty to thirty people. A twenty-foot-long tent-like structure of wood and animal hides was erected on the banks of the creek and was framed with logs and planks staked in the ground, making walls of poles covered with animal hides. Using ropes made of local reeds, the hides were tied to the poles creating separate living quarters within the main structure. Outside the tent-like structure, two large hearths had been built for community usage, most probably for tool making and craftwork.

Each of the living quarters had a brazier pit lined with clay. Around those hearths, many stone tools and remnants of spilled seeds, nuts, and berries were found. A 13,000-year-old specimen of the wild potato, &quot;Solanum maglia&quot;, was also found at the site; these remains, the oldest on record for any species of potato, wild or cultivated, suggest that southern Chile was one of the two main centres for the evolution of &quot;Solanum tuberosum tuberosum&quot;, the common potato. Remains of forty-five different edible plant species were found within the site, over a fifth of them originating from up to away. This suggested that the people of Monte Verde either had traded on or traveled regularly in this extended network.

Other important finds from this site include human coprolites, a footprint, assumed to have been made by a child, stone tools, and cordage. Dr. Dillehay obtained the date for this site by radiocarbon dating charcoal and bone found within the site.

At Monte Verde II, seven partial carcasses of &quot;Notiomastodon&quot;, alongside remains single individual of the extinct llama &quot;Palaeolama&quot; show evidence of butchery, with some of these carcasses having preserved meat tissue still adhered to them.

In the May 9, 2008 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, a team reported that they identified nine species of seaweed and marine algae recovered from hearths and other areas in the ancient settlement. The seaweed samples were directly dated between 14,220 and 13,980 years ago.

==== Chinchihuapi I and Chinchihuapi II ====
These sites, located approximately 500 meters upstream from the Monte Verde sites along the same river, have been dated to about 14,500 BP. Similar materials, including burned areas and fragmentary scorched animal bones, along with small rock flakes, have been recovered. Dillehay and his team conducted excavations between the sites, using test pits and core drillings. They discovered 12 small burned features directly associated with both burned and unburned animal remains, manuport stones, and anthropologically modified flakes, which were dated between 18,500 BP and 14,500 BP. These findings likely indicate seasonal activities in the area. Up until 2019, Dillehay has conducted two additional excavations at the Chinchihuapi site, revealing the presence of lithic tools and flakes, as well as burned features associated with burned animal and plant remains in CH-I.

== Interpretations ==
Material evidence gathered at Monte Verde has reshaped the way archaeologists think about the earliest inhabitants of the Americas. Radiocarbon dating has provided a date of 14,000 BP and possibly 14,800-33,000 BP. Previously, the earliest accepted site had been determined to be near Clovis, New Mexico, dating between 13,500 and 13,000 BP, over 1,000 years later than Monte Verde.

The new dates supplied by Monte Verde have made the site a key factor in the debate over the first migration route from Asia to North America. Before the discovery of Monte Verde, the most popular and widely accepted theory was the overland route, which speculates that the first American inhabitants migrated from Asia across the Bering Strait and then spread throughout North America. However, the early dates associated with Monte Verde appear to weaken this theory. Prior to 13,000 BP, the Cordilleran Glacier (which covered much of present-day Canada) had not yet melted enough to reveal an ice-free corridor for people to reasonably journey by foot. The Monte Verde radiocarbon dates precede 13,000 BP, despite the fact that before the glacial melt, the vast, desolate, icy landscape of much of the Americas could not possibly have permitted enough vegetation to sustain traveling people or herded animals.

The most prevalent theory today is the coastal migration hypothesis, which argues that people migrated from Asia down along the western coasts of North and South America. Monte Verde is located 8,000 miles south of the Bering Strait. Such a considerable distance was probably unreasonable to trek by foot, especially on ice. Furthermore, remains of 22 varieties of seaweed are referenced in regards to this theory. Modern native inhabitants of the regions use these particular local seaweed varieties for medicinal purposes. Using an ethnographic analogy, this suggests that the Monte Verde residents used these varieties for similar purposes, which further suggests an extensive knowledge of marine resources. Together with a relative lack of stone tools, it appears that these first settlers were maritime-adapted hunter-gatherer-fishermen, and not necessarily big-game hunters like the Clovis. Therefore, it is feasible that they traveled along the coast by boat or along the shoreline, and could survive on marine resources throughout the voyage south.

The presence of non-local items at Monte Verde, such as plants, beach-rolled pebbles, quartz, and tar, indicates possible trade networks and other sites of human habitation of similar age.

== Academic history ==

===Diffusion===
Awareness about Monte Verde among the international archaeology community was greatly increased in 1989 when Dillehay delivered a presentation on Monte Verde at a conference on settlement of the Americas at the University of Maine. Archaeologist David J. Meltzer notes on that presentation:
The images Tom Dillehay was showing of the well-preserved remains at Monte Verde—wooden artifacts and house planks, fruits, berries, seeds, leaves, and stems, as well as marine algae, crayfish, chunks of animal hide, and what appeared to be several human coprolites found in three small pits—were unlike anything most of us, who long ago had learned to be used to stone tools and grateful for occasional bits of bone, had ever seen.

=== Pre-Clovis controversy ===
Because of the nature of the preservation of Monte Verde, it was one of the first Pre-Clovis sites to be accepted by the academic community. Dillehay, himself, doubted his dates due to the strong hold the Clovis First hypothesis had on the academic community. Monte Verde was one of the most accepted Pre-Clovis sites, according to a survey done by Amber Wheat in 2012. Out of 132 respondents (mainly archaeologists), approximately 65% of them confirmed Monte Verde as a Pre-Clovis site. Still, the early date for the site was not widely accepted until 1997. It had hitherto been generally agreed that ancient people had entered the Americas using the Bering Strait Land Bridge, which was about 13,000 kilometers (8,000 miles) north of the Monte Verde site. Though the Monte Verde site does not disprove the Bering Strait theory, it does support the theory that, instead of going down the ice free corridor as previously hypothesized, people may have populated the Americas through a coastal route. A group of 12 respected archaeologists revisited the site in 1997 and concluded that Monte Verde was an inhabited site and predated the Clovis culture. One of Dillehay&#x27;s colleagues, Dr. Mario Pino, claimed a lower layer of the site is 33,200 years old, based on the discovery of burned wood several hundred feet to the south of Monte Verde. Radiocarbon dating established the wood as 33,000 years old. Dillehay was cautious of this earlier date, and as of 2007 it has not been verified or accepted by the scientific community.

==Comparison to other early Americas sites==
MV-I has been radiocarbon dated to 33,000 BP. As with other sites that suggest extremely early dates, such as the Topper site in South Carolina and Pedra Furada in Brazil, this deeper layer remains controversial.

The only other archaeological site in Southern Chile comparable in age to Monte Verde is Pilauco Bajo, dated to 12,500–11,000 BP. Researchers postulated that the two sites were complementary – Monte Verde would be a habitation site, and Pilauco Bajo would be a hunting and scavenging site. Further south lies the Pali Aike Crater lava tube, dated to 14,000–10,000 BP.

The Chinchorro culture, which was mostly a coastal culture of northern Chile and southern Peru, originated ca. 9,000 years BP, and was long lasting. Other sites on the coast, such as the Quebrada Jaguay, and Quebrada Tacahuay of Peru, seem to go back to ca. 13,000-12,000 BP. Huaca Prieta in northern Peru was occupied as early as 15,000 BP.

<text>God Fodder is the debut studio album by English rock band Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, released on 1 April 1991 by Columbia Records. After creating their own imprint following the success of several prior independent singles, the band recorded the album from December 1990 to January 1991 in London. Musically, &quot;God Fodder&quot; takes large influence from grebo, shoegaze, noise pop, and dance music, characterized by noisy guitars, complex drum beats, and its usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing regular bass lines and Alex Griffin playing harmonic bass lines. Lyrically, the album features communal efforts written by all the band.

Five different singles were released from &quot;God Fodder&quot; across different regions. Upon its release, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 4 in the UK Albums Chart; it also found an audience in the United States, where the album reached number 91 on the Billboard 200, largely due to the band&#x27;s T-shirt campaign and the videos for “Kill Your Television” and &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot;, which gained traction on MTV&#x27;s “120 Minutes Into The Future”. The record&#x27;s success is said to be a triumph against the dominance of grunge music at the time. The album was named among the year&#x27;s best albums by several magazines. The band played the album in its entirety for the first time in O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in December 2009 and played it again in Birmingham in September 2010.

==Background and recording==
Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin formed in Stourbridge in 1987. Although the band had started out as a gothic rock band, the band &quot;had developed a dense, assaultive sound&quot; by the early 1990s &quot;that was distinguished by their thundering two-bass attack.&quot; After releasing &quot;The Ingredients EP&quot;, the band&#x27;s official first single, &quot;Kill Your Television&quot;, which later featured on &quot;God Fodder&quot;, was a commercial success, reaching number 53 on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the UK Independent Singles Chart and becoming critically acclaimed; furthermore, it heralded the band&#x27;s new grebo sound which they would fully explore on &quot;God Fodder&quot;. The success of the single lead to the band signing to Sony Music, on the grounds that the band would be allowed to release their music through their own label, Furtive, in order to retain a higher degree of creative control whilst concurrently enjoying the benefits of Sony&#x27;s major label distribution and advertising clout.

The band recorded their official debut album, &quot;God Fodder&quot;, between December 1990 and January 1991 at Greenhouse Studios, London, co-producing the record with Jessica Cocoran.
Whilst the band were adding the final touches to &quot;God Fodder&quot;, the band&#x27;s former label Chapter 22 released &quot;Bite&quot;, a compilation of early tracks, including the tracks from &quot;The Ingredients EP&quot; and the &#x27;Kill Your Television&quot; single, alongside some other tracks, without the band&#x27;s input, knowledge or consent.

==Style==

===Music===
&quot;God Fodder&quot; combines grebo music, a &quot;punk-influenced, electronica-informed, hyper, light-hearted rock&quot; genre with which the band were associated, with shoegaze music, a genre which forms the album&#x27;s &quot;prevailing beat&quot;. The album was described as a &quot;blend of frenzied, melodic rock, with the occasional touch of quirkiness&quot;, such as the band&#x27;s usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing &quot;normal basslines&quot; whilst Alex Griffin &quot;scratching out harmonic riffs.&quot; Besides the twin bass work, the album also features complicated drum beats and distorted guitars throughout. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; said the album combines catchy melodies, &quot;pulsing adrenaline beats&quot; and &quot;a wool-covered wall of fuzzy pop noise on which able singer Jonn Penney pastes challenging personal lyrics.&quot;

The album features influences from shoegaze bands such as Ride, numerous Los Angeles bands and &quot;a random selection of English bands&quot; including New Order, Icicle Works and The Wedding Present; all such influences were described as being presented in &quot;bits&quot; or &quot;pinches&quot;. The band use Peavey Electronics distortion on the album. Rowdy album opener and college radio hit &quot;Kill Your Television&quot; previously featured on the &quot;Bite&quot; release and features &quot;chucked cobblestone sloganeering&quot; and was described by one reviewer as getting the album &quot;off to a strong, provocative start.&quot; &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot;, also a college radio hit, has been described as &quot;memorable&quot;. &quot;Selfish&quot; is said to meld &quot;rude dance rhythms&quot; with &quot;nasty guitar.&quot;

===Lyrics===
Like several bands of the era, the band&#x27;s bassist Alex Griffin explained that the songs on &quot;God Fodder&quot; were &quot;communal efforts&quot;, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a lot more gratifying than working with just a single songwriter. One person brings in a 10-second idea and we build on that. It&#x27;s definitely a group thing,&quot; adding that &quot;When people tell me what one of our songs means, I say, &#x27;Yep, you&#x27;re right.&#x27; I&#x27;m not gonna dash their dreams.&quot; &quot;Selfish&quot; is a critique on &quot;trendies, the apathetic and mean-spirited,&quot; and opens with a sample of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; dialogue &quot;why don&#x27;t you wake up and smell what you&#x27;re shovelling?,&quot; which the band included after watching the film and decided it &quot;fitted in really well.&quot; &quot;Happy&quot; was written by lead singer Jonn Penney, who, as Griffin explained, &quot;writes really vague and about personal situations not necessarily his own. He doesn&#x27;t like to explain.&quot; Penney&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;God Fodder&quot; have been described as personal and challenging.

&quot;Kill Your Television&quot; was inspired by a sticker that Griffin purchased in Mystic, Connecticut a few years prior to the song&#x27;s release whilst visiting with friends in Boston: &quot;I had [the sticker] on my bass [while] we were in the process of writing a song which had nothing to do with television, and Penney saw it and thought it would be a good title. We like slogans; you don&#x27;t forget them. So the lyrics were rewritten and [the song] became about television.&quot; The &quot;sneering, cryptic tag line&quot; which ends the song, &quot;soap for sore eyes,&quot; is a reference to the band&#x27;s guitarist Rat who watched every soap opera on television, much to Penney&#x27;s disgust.

==Release==

&quot;God Fodder&quot; was released on 1 April 1991 by the band&#x27;s own Sony Music imprint Furtive Records in the UK, whilst in the United States, the album was released by Columbia Records, another Sony label, on 2 July 1991. The band played concerts throughout the year worldwide in promotion of &quot;God Fodder&quot;, playing alongside bands such as, amongst others, Mega City Four, Senseless Things and Jesus Jones. The band also appeared twice on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the UK. In as early as July 1991, the &quot;NME&quot;, noted that the band were, along with The KLF, Seal, The La&#x27;s and Electronic, making their mark in the United States.

Several singles were released from the album; &quot;Kill Your Television&quot; was released in the UK in 1990 before the album was recorded and in 1992 in the United States. It reached number 53 in the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles Chart. The second single, &quot;Until You Find Out&quot;, was also released in 1990 and reached number 51 in the UK charts. The first official single from the album and first Sony release, &quot;Happy,&quot; was the third single, and reaching number 16 in the UK singles chart in March 1991 and number 11 in the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Trust&quot; was the final single released in the UK, reaching number 21 in September 1991, whilst &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot; was the final American single, reaching number 24 in the US Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The album was a commercial success, reaching number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and spending five weeks on the chart in total. In the United States, the album entered the Top Heatseekers Albums chart at number 9 in October 1991, and ultimately &quot;graduated&quot; when it entered and peaked at number 91 on the official Billboard 200 chart in February 1992. The album&#x27;s gradual success in the United States lead to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine including it in their list of the &quot;Popular Uprising: Class of &#x27;92&quot; in June 1992, where Columbia sales director John Doyce explained &quot;they&#x27;d played and toured a lot of the alternative markets, and we got a real strong sense that the album would continue to sell.&quot; The magazine credited the album&#x27;s gradual stateside success largely to the band&#x27;s T-shirt campaign, referring to the band&#x27;s own distinctive T-shirts, with over 86 different designs being produced within three years (1987–1990).

On 1 February 1992, &quot;God Fodder&quot; was certified &quot;Silver&quot; by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 60,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It has been reported that over 60,000 copies were sold in the first week alone. In the United States, the album has sold over 400,000 copies. As of 2013, &quot;God Fodder&quot; is estimated to have sold around 500,000 copies worldwide.

==Reception and legacy==

The album received generally positive reviews. At the end of 1991, several magazines included the album on their lists of the top 50 albums of the year; &quot;NME&quot; ranked it 23rd, whilst &quot;Select&quot; ranked it 39th. &quot;Kill Your Television&quot; had already ranked at number 37 in &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s list of the top 50 singles of 1990, whilst it also ranked at number 26 in the same year&#x27;s edition of the Festive Fifty, a poll of the top 50 songs of the year assembled by John Peel listeners. &quot;The Morning Call&quot; referred to the record as a &quot;fine&quot; album. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; concluded that the band &quot;sounds like a mishmash of psychedelic Clash meets Spandau Ballet—the former is appreciated, the latter needs to be eliminated.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opined that &quot;all that&#x27;s needed is memorable songs, though the sound and attitude are enough to get by on this promising debut.&quot;

Retrospective commentary on the album has been generally favourable, with some critics citing it as their best album. Nitsuh Abebe of AllMusic said that &quot;God Fodder&quot; was arguably the band&#x27;s best album and adding that, although the album may not be groundbreaking, it was &quot;certainly solid.&quot; The reviewer also said the album was &quot;consistently satisfying&quot; and mentioned how the band&#x27;s &quot;light and hooky&quot; sound was enough &quot;to put quite a distance between their oeuvre and that of the average grebo or punk band.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; was also favourable, praising the album&#x27;s &quot;strong start&quot; and saying that, &quot;derivative to the core, the Neds pinch bits from a random selection of English bands (Wedding Present, Icicle Works, New Order, etc.), but they do so with such breathless enthusiasm that it suits the good-natured cheesiness of the whole endeavor.&quot;

In 2013, Kyle Ryan of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; spoke of how &quot;Grey Cell Green&quot; and &quot;Happy&quot; were &quot;jams back in the day&quot; and how the latter songs remained one of his &quot;all-time favourite songs.&quot; Less favourable to &quot;God Fodder&quot; was &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;″s Chris Ott, saying that &quot;Ned Atomic Dustbin&#x27;s shook their long-on-top dos to the prevailing beat–namely shoegaze. A pinch of Swervedriver, a touch of Ride, the cheesy Peavey distortion of a thousand bad L.A. bands and some timely looks?&quot; In 2003, the website included it at number 10 in their list of &quot;Castoffs and Cutouts: The Top 50 Most Common Used CDs.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine ranked the song &quot;Happy&quot; at number 11 in their list of &quot;120 Reasons to Live,&quot; a list celebrating the 1990s underground music that was aired on MTV&#x27;s alternative music show &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. in the description for the song&#x27;s entry, the magazine cited &quot;God Fodder&quot; as their best album and spoke of how its double-bass approach helped the band survive the dominance of grunge music, saying that despite there being &quot;a lot to dislike&quot; about the band in retrospect, such as their &quot;terrible style&quot; of &quot;baggy clothes, dreadlocks—a vaguely secondhand hippie-punk look&quot;, having &quot;a guitarist named Rat&quot;, a &quot;whimsical&quot; album title in &quot;God Fodder&quot; and two bass players, the latter is what helped make the band unique:
==Live concerts==

Having reformed in 2009, all five original members of the band played &quot;God Fodder&quot; from start to finish in London, on 19 December 2009 at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. 
After playing the album, the band played other tracks from their catalogue. One of the band&#x27;s classic T-shirt designs was sold at the show&#x27;s merchandise stand for the first time since the &quot;God Fodder&quot; era. The concert was critically acclaimed.

The band played the entirety of the album again at the HMV Institute in Birmingham on 25 September 2010 as part of the institute&#x27;s reopening. Interviewed prior to the Birmingham concert, Penney stated that &quot;back when we first toured &quot;God Fodder&quot;, we didn’t play in Birmingham and that’s something we’ll be very happy to address all these years later. We can’t wait to christen the new venue and set a new bar-takings record.&quot;

Speaking to &quot;The Birmingham Mail&quot;, Penney said &quot;we played the whole of &quot;God Fodder&quot; at Shepherd’s Bush in London last Christmas and we thought it would be nice to do it in the Midlands as well. It captures that moment in the 90s when the indie scene in Birmingham and the Black Country was buzzing. It’s quite a fast little album and it’s over fairly quickly, so we’ll come back on and do a Best of set.&quot;

<text>School of Fish is the debut studio album by the American band School of Fish. It was released in April 1991.

==Promotion==
The album was supported by the single &quot;3 Strange Days&quot;, which peaked at No. 12 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. The single included two non-album tracks: the original composition &quot;Where Have I Been&quot; and the cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend We&#x27;re Married&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; noted that &quot;neo-psychedelic guitar-grunge swirls beneath the surface of each song.&quot; &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; concluded that the band &quot;concocted an irresistible brew of tough-guy guitars, sweet vocals and thoughtful lyrics that sounds like a cross between Free, the Babys and Crowded House.&quot;

<doc id="979739" wikidata="Q5568943" url="?curid=979739" title="Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge">
<text>The Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge, or I-205 Bridge, is a segmental bridge that spans the Columbia River between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. It carries Interstate 205, a freeway bypass of Portland, Oregon. The structure is maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation.

Planning for the structure began in earnest in 1964 when it was designated as part of the East Portland Freeway (later renamed Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Freeway), Interstate 205. Construction began in August 1977. In order to avoid disrupting river traffic, the bridge was built one segment at a time. The segments, weighing upwards of 200 tons, were cast downstream and barged into place. The bridge was opened on December 15, 1982. The finished project cost was $169.6 million: $155.7 million from federal funds, $4 million from Washington state funds and $9.9 million from Oregon state funds. Three men died during its construction. The bridge was closed to traffic on May 15, 1983, for a one-day festival named &quot;People&#x27;s Day&quot;, where 125,000 pedestrians crossed the bridge.

It is a twin structure with four lanes in each direction and a bicycle and pedestrian path in between. The bridge is long from the Washington side of the river to Government Island and another in length from Government Island to the Oregon side of the river. The main span, near the Washington side, is long with of vertical clearance at low river levels. The bridge was named for Glenn Jackson, the chairman of the Oregon State Highway Commission and later the Oregon Economic Development Commission.

The average weekday traffic during 2019 was 166,152 vehicles. In 2020, ODOT and WSDOT began a one-year pilot project to allow C-Tran buses to use the shoulders of I-205 over the bridge in order to bypass congestion.

No vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian access to Government Island is available from the bridge.

==Multi-use path==

A multi-use path for pedestrians and cyclists runs along the center of the bridge. This multi-use path connects to two trailheads at each end of the bridge as well as the I-205 Trail through Portland. The path lacks access to Government Island.

<text>Prime Time is an Irish current affairs television programme airing on RTÉ One on Tuesday and Thursday nights (following the &quot;RTÉ Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;).

First broadcast on RTÉ One in 1992, Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan has been its main presenter since 1995. Only one show per week is broadcast during the summer months. In January 2013, &quot;The Frontline&quot;&#x27;s format and presenter were subsumed into &quot;Prime Time&quot; as part of a re-branding exercise at RTÉ News and Current Affairs. Pat Kenny soon left RTÉ. Later the Monday slot which had been &quot;The Frontline&quot; was again split from &quot;Prime Time&quot;; Claire Byrne left to present the newly branded &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; programme in that slot.

==Format==
Ireland&#x27;s current affairs and major societal issues are dealt with, often with politicians, journalists, commentators and industry representatives giving their views live in the studio or via satellite link-up from RTÉ&#x27;s regional studios and abroad. Two to three stories tend to be covered, with a pre-recorded piece from a reporter followed by a studio discussion. Sometimes the full programme will be devoted to one topic, and may consist entirely of an in-depth documentary piece or investigation from a single reporter. Extended or additional editions are broadcast on occasions such as a general election or resulting from major international events, such as the November 2015 Paris attacks. Typically there is no audience attendance, although during these special editions audience involvement and attendance may be included.

===Special Editions===
In January 2007 a programme on Bank closures.

On Thursday April 11th 2024 there will be a special edition on Car Accidents, Road deaths, Traffic jams &amp; Pollution. Reopening of closed railway lines all over the island of Ireland North, South, East, West &amp; Midlands.

==History==

===Early years===
&quot;Prime Time&quot; in its original format began on Thursday 17 September 1992, replacing &quot;Today Tonight&quot;— similar in format, which had aired since 1980. At the outset the programme had two presenters, Olivia O&#x27;Leary and Brian Farrell, and three reporters, Áine Lawlor, Mike Milotte, and Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The introduction of the new programme was part of a wider change in current affairs broadcasting by RTÉ. &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, which had been broadcast from Monday to Thursday, would now be replaced by five very different and distinct types of current affairs programmes which would be broadcast from Sunday to Thursday. These included &quot;Farrell&quot; on Sunday, a series where Brian Farrell would conduct a series of one-to-one interviews with public figures. &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; would fill the Monday current affairs slot and would continue with its usual format of a panel of public figures answering questions from the audience. &quot;Tuesday File&quot; would contain a weekly filmed report. &quot;Marketplace&quot;, which was previously broadcast on Network 2, would occupy the Wednesday slot and would deal with financial matters, industrial relations, public affairs and business. &quot;Prime Time&quot; would round off the week&#x27;s current affairs programming on Thursday evenings.

===Cardinal Secrets===
Mary Raftery&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time&quot; special &quot;Cardinal Secrets&quot; broadcast of 2002 led to the Murphy Commission of Investigation into clerical abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese being set up; the Murphy Report was published in 2009.

===Reynolds defamation===
A spin-off series, Prime Time Investigates, used to be shown on Monday nights in short seasons of four to six episodes, featuring investigative journalism and undercover reporting. The series suspended in 2011 after RTÉ&#x27;s Aoife Kavanagh defamed Fr. Kevin Reynolds in an episode aired on RTÉ One with the title, &quot;Mission to Prey&quot;, during which Kavanagh falsely accused Fr. Kevin Reynolds of raping a woman and fathering a child in Kenya. Director-General of RTÉ Noel Curran admitted the broadcasting of &quot;Mission to Prey&quot; was &quot;one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made&quot; at RTÉ.

&quot;PTI&quot; was officially cancelled by RTÉ director-general Noel Curran on 4 April 2012. RTÉ was fined €200,000 by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) as a result of the defamation of Fr Kevin Reynolds following what the BAI said were serious breaches of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Its report found that &quot;Second-hand repetition of gossip appears to have been treated as corroboration, as Ms Kavanagh did not appear to have met or questioned colleagues who according to the primary source, were aware of the allegations&quot;. Aoife Kavanagh resigned from RTÉ on 4 May 2012.

===Meath East by-election debate===
On 25 March 2013, a &quot;Prime Time&quot; television debate held ahead of the 2013 Meath East by-election featured the candidates from the four parties RTÉ perceived to be the front-runners: Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. Excluded were all other candidates, including the Green Party and Workers&#x27; Party candidates, as well as Direct Democracy Ireland&#x27;s Ben Gilroy, who would finish fourth, ahead of Labour.

Workers&#x27; Party candidate Seamus McDonagh said the &quot;Prime Time&quot; editor had no &quot;consistent criteria&quot; for this decision, and criticised the lack of an invitation to even sit in the audience despite having, he said, the support of several TDs including Richard Boyd Barrett, John Halligan, Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle. DDI&#x27;s Ben Gilroy said RTÉ &quot;just basically ignored us completely.&quot;

===Enda Kenny interview===
Taoiseach Enda Kenny used &quot;Prime Time&quot; to submit to a rare live television interview on 19 February 2015. RTÉ delayed the much anticipated interview for an episode of British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; that was broadcasting scenes live to celebrate 30 years on air. RTE had planned to show the episode before the following days episode as an hour long episode. However, the BBC had not made international broadcasters aware of the significance of the episode in the Who Killed Lucy? storyline. RTE decided to broadcast the episode and Prime Time followed the programme.

<doc id="979759" wikidata="Q4923188" url="?curid=979759" title="Doubt (album)">
<text>Doubt is the second album by British rock band Jesus Jones, released on 21 January 1991 through Food Records. The label witnessed the success of their debut album &quot;Liquidizer&quot; (1989) and wanted more hit-sounding music from the band. Frontman Mike Edwards wrote new material on their tour bus and in hotel rooms; they recorded some of it in early 1990, before touring resumed. After the conclusion of a tour of the United Kingdom, the band spent a week in May 1990 recording the bulk of their next album at Matrix Studios in London. Edwards produced the majority of the tracks, with Food Records co-founder Andy Ross and Martyn Phillips producing one song each.

&quot;Doubt&quot; is a techno-rock album that refines the sample-heavy approach of &quot;Liquidizer&quot;. During the making of it, they listened to music from the likes of the KLF, Janet Jackson and Mel and Kim. Edwards, who had been consuming a large amount of popular music wanted it be a reaction to &quot;Liquidizer&quot;, exploring the influence of dance music had over rock. His lyrics had been compared to that of the Kinks frontmant Ray Davies, while the album&#x27;s psychedelia overtones evoked the Beatles&#x27; late 1960s period and contemporary baggy acts the Charlatans and Happy Mondays.

&quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; was released the lead single from &quot;Doubt&quot; in March 1990; over the next few months, Jesus Jones performed at various festivals, before embarking on their first tour of North America in September 1990. That same month, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; was released as the second single from the album, which was later promoted with a UK tour. The track would be released in the United States in December 1990, while &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; became the third single from &quot;Doubt&quot; that same month. Following an appearance at the Great British Music Weekend, &quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in February 1991. The band promoted it with tours of the UK and US; MTV would help to give the band a boost in popularity in the latter territory.

&quot;Doubt&quot; received generally positive reviews about the songwriting, though some critics were less enthusiastic about it. It reached number 25 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the UK Albums Chart, and later certified platinum in the US. &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot;, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; and &quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot; all reached the top 40 in the UK, with &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; charting the highest at number seven. In the US, &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; and &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; peaked at number four and two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; included it on their list of the year&#x27;s best releases; it and &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; would be nominated for Grammy Awards. The song earned an award from the BMI and PRS for being the most played track at college radio.

==Background and writing==
Jesus Jones released their debut studio album &quot;Liquidizer&quot; was released through Food Records in October 1989. The band&#x27;s emergence happened concurrently with the Madchester movement that birthed Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses. Jesus Jones were being tagged as grebo by the music press, alongside contemporaries Gaye Bikers on Acid and Pop Will Eat Itself, much to the chagrin of frontman Mike Edwards. Despite this, the band received acclaim from publications, while the album would peak number 32 in the UK Albums Chart. Its singles &quot;Info Freako&quot; and &quot;Never Enough&quot; both charted at number 42 on the UK Singles Chart, while &quot;Bring It Down&quot; reached number 46. By the end of the year, they had a publishing deal and a manager; Edwards was confident about this success, though mentioned that it quickly shifted into scrutiny, &quot;doubt and a lack of self-confidence. I looked around at what we&#x27;d done and thought &#x27;Have we just fooled everybody? Are we really that good?

Spurred on by this initial success, Food Records wanted to make Jesus Jones even more popular, urging them to make hit-sounding music. Edwards had started writing material for the next album while the label was busy with releasing &quot;Liquidizer&quot;, which had been issued in the United States by SBK Records. In that territory, three of the album&#x27;s songs received significant airplay from alternative radio stations. They did not have much time to work on songs as they toured incessantly, forcing them to write while travelling. Edwards brought along a Roland sampler and keyboard to craft tracks on their tour bus. Off-days were spent in hotel rooms, where they were able to have a writing set-up.

==Recording==
Jesus Jones recorded new material in early 1990 prior to touring in Romania, shortly after the revolution, and across mainland Europe with the Cramps. Jesus Jones embarked on a short, five-date tour of the UK in May 1990, with support from Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin. According to the album booklet, the bulk of the album was recorded in seven days in May 1990, but the mixing process &quot;took a bit longer&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Edwards said that recording took only six days. He said it was listed as seven to &quot;make it seem credible, and also there&#x27;s that tiresome religious connotation, &#x27;On the seventh day we rested. Food Records gave the band unlimited funds, with them opting to recorded in a cheaper studio, using only a portion of the time they took on the first album. More money was spent on the mixing process and making remixes than recording itself. Keyboardist Iain Baker said Edwards was in a stressful environment, having to deliver on expectations placed on him. As such, practically every demo they had was &quot;pressed into service, every idea had to be used&quot; for the album.

Sessions were held at Matrix Studios in London, and due to the short time they had, they ended up completing three tracks per day. Edwards produced the majority of the songs with Clive Goddard acting as the engineer. Food Records co-founder Andy Ross produced &quot;I&#x27;m Burning&quot;, while Martyn Phillips engineered and produced &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;. The latter collaboration came about as the band enjoyed his work with the Beloved. Edwards showed Phillips a version of the track, which had samples taken from &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; (1987) by Prince. As Phillips had previously got into trouble for using a sample without authorization with the Beloved, he went about altering &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;. John Fryer mixed the songs, while Phil Harding and Ian Curnow remixed and did additional production on &quot; International Bright Young Thing&quot; and &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot;. Baker said the latter two individuals offered &quot;some pop gloss&quot; to the two tracks. He remarked that the rest of the band were more enthusiastic about the production since it provided &quot;some bass as well as treble&quot;, compared to the &quot;tinny blast&quot; of &quot;Liquidizer&quot;.

==Composition and lyrics==

===Music and themes===
&quot;Doubt&quot; continued the sample-heavy direction of &quot;Liquidizer&quot;, but refined it; where the latter had found sounds and other miscellaneous audio clips, the band wanted the tracks on &quot;Doubt&quot; to be anchored around samples. The advancement of technology allowed gave them more ways of toying with samples, ranging from reversing to pitch shifting and altering the structure. The members of Jesus Jones had slowly become aware of what Baker dubbed &quot;the sample wars&quot;, exemplified by the Turtles suing De La Soul. He said that they wanted to showcase that sample was not about stealing someone else&#x27;s music, but instead making new sounds from it. Nick Duerden in &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; wrote that it melded &quot;screaming guitars with samples, white noise and techno dynamics&quot;, while &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Matthew Chabe said they &quot;drop[ped] the wall-of-noise for chiming guitars and Beatle-esque melodies&quot; after the first track. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Jon Pareles wrote that the album &quot;layers on swirls of sound that recall late-1960&#x27;s psychedelia,&quot; in particular the Beatles late 1960s period, which Doug Iverson of &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; compared to baggy acts the Charlatans and Happy Mondays. While complimenting its cohesive nature, Baker saw it was their &quot;most disjointed&quot; release due to its creation and having to ask Food Records if it was to their liking.

Musically, the sound of &quot;Doubt&quot; has been described as techno-rock. Parry Gettelman of &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that the &quot;melodies are stronger, and the mixes are more radio-friendly – with vocals right up front&quot;, giving the album &quot;stronger pop leanings&quot; than what was heard on &quot;Liquidizer&quot;. Edwards said the band intentionally made &quot;Doubt&quot; to serve as a reaction to its predecessor: &quot;making a strong statement about what rock music should be about in the &#x27;90s, which I think has less to do with the dance-rock sound than the influence of dance music on rock music, the techniques of dance music&quot;. Edwards had been consuming a substantial amount of popular music, from Mel and Kim to Janet Jackson, which he tried to emulate with the album. Alongside this, Baker said they would often be listening to &quot;Chill Out&quot; (1990) by the KLF while on tour.

Edwards said the album&#x27;s title partially stemmed from the intensive interviews, where he was being quizzed on &quot;everything the band and I had done and were doing&quot; when promoting &quot;Liquidizer&quot;, which coincided with him dealing with depression. Steve Hochman of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Edwards&#x27; lyricism came across with an &quot;wit and sentimental eye in the tradition&quot; of Ray Davies from the Kinks. Baker thought that the stressful process of making the album shaped its narrative direction, explaining that in lieu of the tracks themselves &quot;telling a story, the process of writing actually became the story&quot;. He went on to say that the songs were representations of the locations they visited, individuals they interacted with, the uplifting outlook which they had from being a new act, alongside the &quot;uncertainty, the fear of failure, and the doubt&quot; they faced.

===Tracks===
&quot;Doubt&quot; opens with &quot;Trust Me&quot;, the shortest song on the album, recalling the sound of &quot;Liquidizer&quot; and &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot; (1990) by Living Colour with its acid house groove and wall of sound guitarwork. The song was influenced by samples of Formula One racing cars driving on a race track, which Edwards had taped off a television with a cassette recorder. Baker said they sped up the sound bites until they &quot;sounded like demented wasps.&quot; &quot;Who? Where? Why&quot; uses an Eastern melody, extrapolated from an African-esque chant that Edwards found on a tape of African music that he learned from the Willesden Library in London. Baker said that a portion of that sample is played normally before it loops itself repeatedly. They had written it shorted after getting signed, as they became aware of the expectations from press outlets. The dance-rock track &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; mixes the tape loop experimentation of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (1966) by the Beatles with the contemporary beats from dance music. The song remained lyric-less until the band were on a flight from Tokyo, Japan, serving as a summarization of fans they encountered while traveling around the world. Edwards described &quot;I&#x27;m Burning&quot; as a &quot;re-occurrence of the B-side that was too good syndrome&quot;, where he tried to sound like the Icicle Works. &quot;Select&quot; writer Neil Perry thought that it showed an evolution of the band&#x27;s sound, &quot;now a little tighter with the bluster and rush but still full blast on atmosphere&quot;.

Baker saw &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; as an attempt by Edwards to create a mature track, adding that audiences considered them as a act. The song refers to the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Edwards said he came across a cover of &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot; that Simple Minds had done, liking their &quot;enthusiasm for the song but not necessarily their version, but also thinking that &quot;Sign O’ The Times&quot; is a very down song, it has a very bleak view of the times&quot;. Scott Rowley of &quot;Louder&quot; said Edwards then went out to remake the song for &quot;the, like, &quot;actual&quot; times&quot; with &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, crafting a demo that used loops from &quot;Sign O&#x27; the Times&quot;. &quot;Nothing to Hold Me&quot; features a sample of the TARDIS sound from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and has Edwards and Baker &quot;speaking [from] our hearts&quot;, with Edwards saying Baker was a &quot;man for whom tuning is only a concert for others. Like me&quot;. Baker commented that it referred to a girl he was dating while the rest of the band &quot;put a wedge between us&quot;; he wrote it after they visited the Berlin Wall. &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; was reminiscent of the work of Happy Mondays, and has a note of a female voice edited to sound akin to an organ. The initial demo of it was influenced by Sly and the Family Stone and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot; (1989), as they tried to make a swingbeat track in the style of Teddy Riley, giving it the working title &quot;Janet&quot;.

&quot;Welcome Back Victoria&quot; evoked the sound of XTC and &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; (1966) by the Kinks. It features acoustic guitar parts over synthesizers and the ticking of a programmed snare drum, and talks about the double standards of the Victorian era. With &quot;Are You Satisfied?&quot;, Edwards wanted to make a track he considered &quot;metal house&quot;. &quot;Two and Two&quot; is a punk rock and pop metal song, where the band tried to evoke the sound of Sonic Youth. &quot;Stripped&quot; is influenced by a message that a Romanian journalist was adamant that Edwards returned home with: &quot;Everybody is hungry / Everyone needs to know&quot;. Perry referred to it as a &quot;nightmare soundscape that changes from tortured screaming to a super-funky &quot;, while Baker remarked that it was the &quot;sound of a band who are listening to way too much Big Black&quot; and attempting to distil that into a pop song. The album concludes with &quot;Blissed&quot;, a mellow track anchored by a synthesizer part and bird sounds, influenced by &quot;Chill Out&quot;. Inspired by a John Lennon quote about wanting to have thousands of voices on a recording, Edwards wanted to make something that fit that using a sampler. He wrote the words to it after a van trip to the Swiss Alps in Switzerland; Baker considered it to be about living in the moment.

==Release==
===Album promotion and touring===
Despite its quick recording time, Baker mentioned that Jesus Jones did not have the time to release an album as they had to go back on tour. Throughout 1990, their popularity increased as they trekked across other countries. Over the next few months, they appeared at various festivals, including Glastonbury and Reading. In September 1990, the band embarked on their first tour of North America. The following month, the band played a Andy Kershaw session for BBC Radio 1, where they performed &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; and &quot;Trust Me&quot;, and went on a tour of the UK.

&quot;Doubt&quot; was released in the UK on 21 January 1991 through Food Records; &quot;Are You Satisfied?&quot; was included on the US copies of the album, but was absent from the UK editions. SBK Records would gave the band a large amount of promotion in an attempt to break them in America, despite them being an alternative act amongst a roster of Wilson Phillips and Vanilla Ice. The band performed at the Great British Music Weekend, a tie-in with the Brit Awards which featured acts, including the Farm and Ride. In February 1991, the band went on a tour of the UK with support from Soho. Jesus Jones embarked on a US tour, which lasted until June 1991, with support from Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin. MTV helped to boost the band&#x27;s career in the US, with Edwards remarking that he could only considering himself a success if he made it in that territory.

Jesus Jones released their first video album, &quot;Big in Alaska&quot;, on VHS through Picture Music International on 1 June 1991, which collected the music videos from &quot;Liquidizer&quot; and &quot;Doubt&quot;. Upon returning home to the UK, they supported INXS for a show at the Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 72,000, before returning to the US to appear at the MTV Video Music Awards. Jesus Jones ended the year headlining a Food Records Christmas show alongside labelmates Blur, Diesel Park West and Whirlpool. In January 1992, they played two shows in Brazil in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, respectively, as part of the Rock in Rio festival.

===Singles===
&quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Doubt&quot; on 26 March 1990. Its various CD, seven-inch and twelve-inch vinyl configurations included remixes alongside &quot;Dead People&#x27;s Lives&quot; and &quot;Info Freako&quot;. The music video for &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; features, as Baker describes, the band &quot;dressed up like Muppets covered in vomit&quot;; an alternative video was shot for the US market, directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The band performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 12 April 1990. 

Coinciding with their first North American jaunt, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; was released as the second single from the album on 24 September 1990. The CD version featured &quot;Are You Satisfied?&quot;, &quot;Damn Good at This&quot; and &quot;Move Me&quot; as the B-sides, while the twelve-inch edition included &quot;Are You Satisfied?&quot; alongside remixes of &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; and the &quot;Liquidizer&quot; track &quot;Move Mountains&quot;. The music video for &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, which was filmed at Pinewood Studios, shows footage of the band, cut with conflicts from across Europe in the late 1980s. Images of political figures George H. W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev and map of central Europe can also be seen.

&quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; sat outside of the UK top 30 single chart. This position, which was lower than &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot;, did not concern SBK Records, who were waiting to issue &quot;Doubt&quot; in 1991 and push &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; soon afterwards. A group of US radio programmers had seen the band live in the UK and were ecstatic about &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, to the point they purchased copies of it and were subsequently playing them over the US airwaves. SBK&#x27;s radio promoter Mike Mena called the stations, and while appreciative, asked them to stop until it went on sale. A week after this, Mena was contacted by one programmer who said their listeners were complaining about not being able to hear the track. The programmer said he was putting the track back in rotation and told Mena that the label should rush release it. SBK officially sent the song to radio stations in December 1990. They had planned to issue an EP of live recordings until this happened, which eventually was made available at retail, consisting of versions of tracks from &quot;Liquidizer&quot;.

&quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in December 1990. Its various CD, twelve-inch vinyl and picture disc configurations included remixes alongside &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;Need to Know&quot;. Baker said the music video for &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; has the band jumping on a boxing ring with a camera position above them. Though, as it was made using a green screen, the band had no clue what video would be like until it was finished. They performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 10 January 1991, and then on &quot;Going Live!&quot; nine days later. 

&quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot; was released as the fourth single from the album on 18 February 1991. Its various CD, ten-inch and twelve-inch vinyl configurations included remixes alongside &quot;Caricature&quot; and &quot;Kill Today&quot;. The band performed &quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; at the end of the month. &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; was reissued in July 1991 with remixed versions of &quot;Broken Bones&quot;, &quot;Info Psyscho&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back Victoria&quot; as its B-sides. &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; was released in the US on 30 July 1991. &quot;Welcome Back Victoria&quot; was released as a promotional radio single in 1991, with the album version and a CHR remix done by Gary Hellman and John Luongo.

===Reissues, related releases and events===
A two-CD and DVD set of &quot;Doubt&quot; was released in 2014, collecting various B-sides, remixes, live performances and demos. In September 2014, Jesus Jones went on their first UK trek in a decade, where they performed &quot;Doubt&quot; in its entirety. They subsequently repeated this in March 2015 with a trip to Australia and New Zealand. The regular version of the album, alongside 2014 bonus material, was included on the career-spanning box set &quot;Some of the Answers&quot; in 2022. It was re-pressed on vinyl through Demon Records in 2022.

&quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot;, &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot;, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back Victoria&quot; were featured on the compilation album &quot;The Greatest&quot; (1998). &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot;, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; and &quot;Blissed&quot; were included on the compilation &quot;Never Enough (The Best of Jesus Jones)&quot; (2002). &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; and &quot;Stripped&quot; were featured on the compilation &quot;The Collection – A Selection of Band Favourites and Rarities&quot; (2011). &quot;Trust Me&quot;, &quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot;, &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot;, &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot;, &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot;, &quot;Welcome Back Victoria&quot;, &quot;Are You Satisfied?&quot; and &quot;Blissed&quot; were featured on the compilation &quot;Zeroes and Ones – The Best Of&quot; (2022).

==Critical reception==

Several critics praised the songwriting of &quot;Doubt&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said it &quot;benefits greatly from Mike Edwards&#x27; improved songwriting, as well as a better idea of how to effectively fuse guitar-rock with samples and dance-club beats&quot;. In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, journalist Simon Reynolds added to this, saying it was &quot;close to a perfect fusion of rock and house&quot; music, with Chabe singling out &quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; as a prime example. Iverson, meanwhile, considered the band to be &quot;more than your usual musical smorgasbord&quot;, adding that they are able to &quot;coax your carcass out on to the dance floor&quot;. Perry was impressed that the band could avoid being pigeon-holed, ignoring trends of the day, but complained that many of the tracks were &quot;too short. As soon as you sink into any particular rhythm that&#x27;s it, too late&quot;.

A few reviewers were less impressed with the songwriting. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writer Mark Jenkins wrote that with Edwards &quot;layering sing-along refrains over hammering synthetic rhythms and associated racket,&quot; the album &quot;retains the sass and savvy&quot; of &quot;Liquidizer&quot;. He thought that &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; and &quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; were significantly &quot;less catchy than the ones [singles] that preceded it&quot;; Gary Graff and Doug Brod &quot;Trouser Press&quot; thought that the album lacked the &quot;bursting freshness (or repetitiveness) of its predecessor&quot;. In a retrospective piece for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, contributor Chris Ott thought that the album&#x27;s &quot;techno-rock synthesis has aged disastrously&quot;; despite this, he mentioned that it was &quot;agonizingly samey and overflowing with filler&quot;. &quot;New Straits Times&quot; R.S. Murthi wrote that &quot;too often, the stylistic welding leads to some blurred moments where you don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a common thread holding it all together&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Doubt&quot; topped the albums chart in the UK; in other territories, it peaked at number six in New Zealand, number ten in Europe, number 23 in Australia, number 25 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 35 in Canada. It was certified silver and gold by the British Phonographic Industry on the same day two weeks after release, while the Recording Industry Association of America certified it gold in June 1991, and platinum by November 1991. In other countries, the album was certified platinum by Music Canada and Recorded Music NZ.

&quot;Real, Real, Real&quot; charted at number 19 in the UK. In the US, it peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number five on Dance Club Songs, number 26 on Alternative Airplay and number 30 on Radio Songs. In other territories, it peaked at number ten in Canada, number 37 in New Zealand, number 48 in Europe, number 59 in the Netherlands and number 117 in Australia.

&quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; charted at number 31 in the UK, both on original release and its reissue. In the US, it peaked at number two on the Hot 100, being kept off the top spot by &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; (1991) by Bryan Adams. It also reached number one on Alternative Songs, number three on Radio Songs, number seven on Mainstream Rock Airplay and number 29 on Dance Club Songs. In other territories, it reached number 18 in Canada, number 29 in New Zealand, number 35 in Australia, number 61 in the Netherlands, number 84 in Germany and number 87 in Europe.

&quot;International Bright Young Thing&quot; charted at number seven in the UK; in other territories, it peaked at number six on Alternative Airplay in the US, number 22 in New Zealand, number 29 in Europe, number 58 in Canada, and number 79 in Australia. &quot;Who? Where? Why?&quot; charted at number 21 in the UK, number 48 in New Zealand and number 82 in Europe.

==Accolades and legacy==
&quot;Toledo Blade&quot; included &quot;Doubt&quot; on their list of the best releases from the year. Jesus Jones had two Grammy Awards nominations: &quot;Doubt&quot; for Best Alternative Music Album and &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; earned a BMI and PRS award for the most played track at college radio. The band won the Best New Artist in a Video award for appearing in &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; at the MTV Awards.

In July 1991, EMF, an act that had been viewed as an imitation of Jesus Jones, had commercial success in the US with &quot;Unbelievable&quot; (1991), with it topping the Hot 100. The concurrent Madchester movement had previously failed to crack the North American market, with the Charlatans having returned home from a US tour early in the first half of the year and the Stone Roses refusing to tour the country outright. Similarly, the latter had been occupied with record company issues while the members of Happy Mondays had lost themselves in hedonism. Publications in the UK noted that Jesus Jones commercially outdid these two acts in the US. AJ Ramierz of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that both &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; and &quot;Unbelievable&quot; would date &quot;obscenely fast, a trait that relegated those singles to the status of curious novelties not long after&quot;, with their respective follow-up releases being &quot;forgotten cast-offs of a big Brit-led dance-rock intersection which never materialized&quot;.

Duerden said there was speculation of another British Invasion of the US charts, with &quot;God Fodder&quot; (1991) by Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin following shortly after, though this did not ultimately occur. Capitol Records&#x27; representative Jeffrey Shane, who attributed the band&#x27;s cross-over success to his album-oriented rock (AOR) department, said they made radio stations more conscious of the demand for alternative tracks on rock stations, and as such, aided the careers of Nirvana and School of Fish. The staff at &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; said Jesus Jones&#x27; success, alongside that of Nirvana, helped to obscure the lines between alternative and mainstream music in 1991. In a 1992 interview, Mark Arm of Mudhoney credited Jesus Jones&#x27; success for giving grunge its commercial breakthrough. Christopher Lloyd of &quot;Louder Than War&quot; wrote in 2014 that the band &quot;pioneer[ed] the use computers and samplers to create intelligent indie pop music, and history never really paid them their dues for doing so&quot;.

<doc id="979766" wikidata="Q11682054" url="?curid=979766" title="Gau (Final Fantasy)">
<text>Gau (; Japanese: ) is a character introduced in the 1994 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square Enix. A feral child, Gau was raised by animals in the game&#x27;s Veldt location after his father abandoned him as an infant, and later develops a familial bond with the characters Cyan and Sabin after they offer him food. Unlike other characters in the game, he fights specifically using enemy movesets the player can learn through using him against enemy encounters on the Veldt, though this renders him unable to be controlled for the duration of the fight. He has since appeared in other games related to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where he is voiced by Tomo Muranaka.

Gau received mixed reception upon release, particularly for being very difficult to use as a character in terms of gameplay, and the amount of time investment on the parts of players to get the most out of him. He has also been seen as too narratively disconnected from the game&#x27;s main plot, however he has also received praise for his often comedic portrayal alongside his tragic backstory. He was also praised for his role in Cyan and Sabin&#x27;s characterization, acting as a surrogate son to the former and brother to the latter, as well as the sense of family he brought to the group with his character&#x27;s personal quest.
==Appearances==
Gau is a feral child in the 1994 Square Enix video game &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Surviving by himself in the wilderness, he is first encountered in the game&#x27;s Veldt location by the characters Cyan and Sabin, where after being fed some meat he will join up with the pair. After some comedic misadventures, he helps them return to the rest of the group. In the second half of the game, the group discovers that Gau&#x27;s father is alive. They help dress him to be presentable to meet the man, only to discover he is insane. His wife died in childbirth, and driven insane he believed the crying baby to be a monster and abandoned it in the wild. Sabin threatens to strike the man in anger, but Gau stops him. The man compliments Gau&#x27;s looks, saying he &quot;must make his father proud&quot;, something that Gau takes to heart. Gau expresses he is happy just to see his father alive and well, and the group departs.

Unlike other characters in the game, Gau lacks a regular &quot;Fight&quot; command and cannot equip weapons. Instead he has two skills unique to him: Rage and Leap. The Rage skill allows him to select from a list of learned rages, enemy attack patterns Gau can mimic. While active, he will become uncontrollable for the rest of the fight or until his health is depleted. Meanwhile, he gains both the special traits of that enemy and will randomly attacks with moves available to the enemy. Gau can learn additional rages through the Leap command, which is only available when on the game&#x27;s Veldt location. When using it during a random enemy encounter, Gau will jump towards the group of enemies and the battle will end, with Gau leaving the party temporarily. On the next random encounter, after combat Gau will return to the party and have learned any rages possible from the previous enemies and those from the current encounter.

In other games, he appears as a playable character in &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot; and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, where in the latter of which he is voiced by Tomo Muranaka. Outside of video games, cards representing Gau have been produced for the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;. A keychain figure based on his chibi artwork was also produced by Bandai, as part of a series to promote the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;.

==Conception and design==

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was developed with the mindset that none of the playable cast was the protagonist, and that each of them were equally the &quot;main character&quot;. The cast of characters were selected from submissions from across the development team, with writer Yoshinori Kitase contributing the characters Celes, Kefka, and Gau, the last of which inspired by the story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; and tales of children raised by wolves in the wild. Once the cast was selected, each individual would write their character&#x27;s story, with Kitase balancing the plot as things developed while fleshing out his own characters.

Standing 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall, Yoshitaka Amano was commissioned to design the characters for the game from brief outlines provided. Given full creative freedom, Amano wanted to make &quot;real&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; characters, though with consideration for their representation in-game as small computer sprites. Said graphics were designed by Nomura, who drew the chibi artwork of the characters, and Kazuko Shibuya, who designed the in-game sprites. Gau appears as a young boy with spikey long green hair pulled into a ponytail, green shorts, a poncho, and red and yellow straps around his ankles and wrists. Amano drew several additional pieces of concept art for the character to both establish his design but moreso his personality.

When developing the character&#x27;s story, Gau was meant to be separate from the overarching narrative, and meant instead to give a broader sense to the overall story. Over the course of the game they wanted to illustrate his use of language developing from a few simple sentences to offering the final words in important scenes. His personality was defined as speaking freely due to growing up on his own, however at the same time he has a sense of compassion and genuinely apologizes if he makes a slip of the tongue. Cyan was meant to serve as a surrogate father to Gau, each of them having lost their parents while Cyan had lost his family. His relationship with Gau was intended to be the closest, with the development team joking Cyan would routinely impart knowledge of the world upon Gau he learned only moments prior and he himself didn&#x27;t fully understand. Additionally, the reunion scene with Gau&#x27;s father was originally meant to occur in the first half of the game, with Cyan being the one to grow angry with him instead of Sabin.

==Critical reception==
Gau received mixed reception, particularly due to the difficulty of using him as a character during gameplay. Patrick Holleman in the book &quot;Reverse Design: Final Fantasy VI&quot; praised Gau&#x27;s gameplay as &quot;very innovative&quot; but acknowledged the significant difficulty to properly make use of it due to the investment needed to make the most out of it and the Rage ability&#x27;s random nature. Ritwik Mitra of &quot;The Gamer&quot; found the nature of Gau&#x27;s abilities &quot;annoying&quot;, and while he found the character&#x27;s backstory interesting felt it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to make full use of him compared to much simpler characters in the game&#x27;s roster. The staff of &quot;Edge&quot; however praised the means to recruit Gau coupled with his gameplay abilities, feeling they represented a &quot;marriage of backstory with active application in the game world [that] fostered a clarity and precision&quot; not often seen in video games at that time.

Other aspects of the character were more positively received. &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Cassandra Ramos called Gau an interesting take on the feral child concept due to how he survived by observing monsters and learning their attack patterns, and enjoyed how this was reflected in the character&#x27;s gameplay. She further added that while Gau could be &quot;uncouth&quot; the character was also kind and innocent, and enjoyed that his basic grasp of language allowed him to interact and help his friends, and that his tragic backstory gave him a &quot;remarkable childhood&quot;. Hollman meanwhile stated that while Gau is a peripheral character to the game&#x27;s story, it didn&#x27;t mean &quot;what little we see of him is handled badly&quot;. Instead he praised how Gau despite being raised in the wild showed genuine sympathy for Cyan&#x27;s loss, and while the reunion scene with his father was heartbreaking, he found Gau&#x27;s happiness for &quot;even the slightest bit of off-hand praise&quot; from him to be moving.

The staff of &quot;RPGFan&quot; stated that while they knew the character could be strong, his skills made him too difficult to use as a character. Lucas Greene in particular stated Gau was his least favorite character and left him unused when playing the game, feeling he didn&#x27;t fit the title narratively and didn&#x27;t &quot;understand why he&#x27;s there or what he adds to the game or the story at all.&quot; Other staff members agreed, but also stated they enjoyed his comedic moments and found they fit the game well, with Aleks Franiczek stating the character was worth bringing along alone for how funny he found him. The staff additionally appreciated the sequence leading up to Gau&#x27;s reunion with his father, feeling it gave the group a sense of family and wishing the game had more moments like that.

===Analysis of themes and music===

In the book &quot;The Legend of Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Pierre Maugein stated that while Gau is clearly a secondary character, he also acts as a &quot;type of self-reflection of the game’s progress&quot;. Unlike many of the other characters who are contending with their own grief, Gau&#x27;s primary goal is to stop Kefka, the game&#x27;s antagonist that destroyed the world. Maugein further described him as a constrained sort of shōnen manga protagonist in this regard, someone rushing in to a &quot;vengeful crusade without a deeper thought for its implications&quot;. He felt Gau&#x27;s most important role in the party was as a surrogate son to Cyan and a brother of sorts to Sabin, giving the former an outlet for his fatherly love and making the duo &quot;one of the most touching parts of the game&quot; due to their powerful ties, and sharing the latter&#x27;s desire for freedom. He added that despite Gau&#x27;s &quot;beastly state&quot;, he showed some of the most humanity and growth amongst the cast, going from barely being able to speak a language at the start to expressing care for his friends at the finale.

Sebastian Deken in his book examining &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and its themes described him as &quot;a bit of a mystery&quot;, comparing his characterization and means of joining with the party to how &quot;a dog might be tempted to follow someone home&quot; by someone feeding them. He felt while the character was a good source of comedic relief, such made it easy to overlook his sad backstory, and to Deken his theme music seemed to fill that role. He described it as &quot;unembellished, a little sad, and unfailingly sweet&quot;, and added that once you got past his &quot;kookiness, so was Gau&quot;. Though it only plays twice, it helps to set up his character, and drive home the point of it in Deken&#x27;s view. Holleman in his own book also agreed, describing how the cello instrument&#x27;s use in it gave both a melancholy sound as well as one invoking imagery of an animal. As the theme progresses, Holleman felt the tune after the full instrumental accompaniment felt like &quot;a human choking down an anguished cry&quot; while showing a brave face.

Deken further emphasized how the Veldt&#x27;s own unique music felt like a secondary theme for Gau, sharing many themes with his main themes and even melodies with Gau&#x27;s &quot;formal&quot; theme before diverging from it. As it progresses it becomes distinctly different than Gau&#x27;s own, something that Deken read as &quot;getting wilder with each passing section&quot; in a way that &quot;mirrors Gau’s exile from humanity&quot; and gives a better look at his lost childhood. He felt that the themes when listened in the context of each other helped drive home the theme of his &quot;wildness as a hide draped over his gentleness and innocence.&quot;

<doc id="979767" wikidata="Q4734187" url="?curid=979767" title="Aloha Festivals">
<text>The Aloha Festivals are an annual series of free cultural celebrations observed in the state of Hawaii in the United States based on the Makahiki, the beginning of the Native Hawaiian year marked by the sighting of the Pleiades (&quot;Makali&#x27;i&quot;). It is the only statewide cultural festival in the nation. Highlights include the presentation of the Royal Court, a ho&#x27;olaule&#x27;a in Waikiki, and the Floral Parade. Approximately 30,000 people volunteer to plan, organize, and provide labor for the Aloha Festivals each year. Their efforts entertain over 1,000,000 people from throughout the state and visitors from all over the world.

==History==

=== Establishment ===
In the spirit of preserving the Hawaiian culture and heritage, the Aloha Festivals were established in 1946 as Aloha Week by former members of the local Junior Chamber of Commerce. The former manager of the festivals, Goriann Akau, has said, &quot;In 1946, after the war, Hawaiians needed an identity. We were lost and needed to regroup. When we started to celebrate our culture, we began to feel proud. We have a wonderful culture that had been buried for a number of years. This brought it out again. Self-esteem is more important than making a lot of money.&quot;

=== Scaling down ===
The festival was celebrated on six of Hawaii&#x27;s islands, but in 2008 festival organizers decided to hold most events on Oahu due to a lack of funding. There was also the chance that the Floral Parade would be cancelled altogether, but it was saved by private donors and funds from the City and County of Honolulu.

No Aloha festival was held in 2020. (This was first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, a year which had many disruptions)

== Events ==

=== Presentation of the Royal Court ===
The court is selected from a pool of applicants, all of whom must be of Hawaiian ancestry and of certain ages. The festival itself begins with the presentation of the royal court during the opening ceremony. The ceremony takes place at Helumoa, a section of Waikiki near the Royal Hawaiian Center.

=== Floral Parade ===
The Floral Parade starts at the intersection of Ala Moana Boulevard and Kamakee st. and goes through Waikiki before finishing at Kapiolani Park. The parade features p&#x27;au riders, marching bands, hula halaus, and that year&#x27;s Aloha Festival Royal Court.

===Hoʻolauleʻa===
The Hoʻolauleʻa is a block party held in Waikiki. There is Hawaiian music, hula, and food. Attendance is typically in the thousands.

== Themes ==
Each year has a specific theme:

*2023: Piliʻaina - kinship with the Land

<doc id="979771" wikidata="Q6760420" url="?curid=979771" title="Marginal likelihood">
<text>A marginal likelihood is a likelihood function that has been integrated over the parameter space. In Bayesian statistics, it represents the probability of generating the observed sample for all possible values of the parameters; it can be understood as the probability of the model itself and is therefore often referred to as model evidence or simply evidence. 

Due to the integration over the parameter space, the marginal likelihood does not directly depend upon the parameters. If the focus is not on model comparison, the marginal likelihood is simply the normalizing constant that ensures that the posterior is a proper probability. It is related to the partition function in statistical mechanics.

==Concept==
Given a set of independent identically distributed data points formula_1 where formula_2 according to some probability distribution parameterized by formula_3, where formula_3 itself is a random variable described by a distribution, i.e. formula_5 the marginal likelihood in general asks what the probability formula_6 is, where formula_3 has been marginalized out (integrated out):

:formula_8

The above definition is phrased in the context of Bayesian statistics in which case formula_9 is called prior density and formula_10 is the likelihood. Recognizing that the marginal likelihood is the normalizing constant of the Bayesian posterior density formula_11, one also has the alternative expression 

:formula_12

which is an identity in formula_3. The marginal likelihood quantifies the agreement between data and prior in a geometric sense made precise in de Carvalho et al. (2019). In classical (frequentist) statistics, the concept of marginal likelihood occurs instead in the context of a joint parameter formula_14, where formula_15 is the actual parameter of interest, and formula_16 is a non-interesting nuisance parameter. If there exists a probability distribution for formula_16, it is often desirable to consider the likelihood function only in terms of formula_15, by marginalizing out formula_16:
:formula_20

Unfortunately, marginal likelihoods are generally difficult to compute. Exact solutions are known for a small class of distributions, particularly when the marginalized-out parameter is the conjugate prior of the distribution of the data. In other cases, some kind of numerical integration method is needed, either a general method such as Gaussian integration or a Monte Carlo method, or a method specialized to statistical problems such as the Laplace approximation, Gibbs/Metropolis sampling, or the EM algorithm.

It is also possible to apply the above considerations to a single random variable (data point) formula_21, rather than a set of observations. In a Bayesian context, this is equivalent to the prior predictive distribution of a data point.

In Bayesian model comparison, the marginalized variables formula_3 are parameters for a particular type of model, and the remaining variable formula_23 is the identity of the model itself. In this case, the marginalized likelihood is the probability of the data given the model type, not assuming any particular model parameters. Writing formula_3 for the model parameters, the marginal likelihood for the model &quot;M&quot; is

:formula_25

It is in this context that the term &quot;model evidence&quot; is normally used. This quantity is important because the posterior odds ratio for a model &quot;M&quot;1 against another model &quot;M&quot;2 involves a ratio of marginal likelihoods, called the Bayes factor:

:formula_26

which can be stated schematically as

:posterior odds = prior odds × Bayes factor

<text>Mr. Bad Example is an album by the American musician Warren Zevon, released through Giant Records in October 1991. Zevon supported the album with a North American tour, with the Odds serving as both opener and backing band.

==Production==
&quot;Mr. Bad Example&quot; was produced by Waddy Wachtel. Los Angeles session musicians contributed to the album. Zevon sometimes struggled for songwriting ideas, but always finished a song once he had started.

Dwight Yoakam provided backing vocals on &quot;Heartache Spoken Here&quot;; Dan Dugmore played pedal steel. David Lindley played a variety of instruments on &quot;Quite Ugly One Morning&quot;. &quot;Searching for a Heart&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Love at Large&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;Mr. Bad Example&quot; &quot;a wonderful, resonant album, eclectic and accessible.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; deemed it &quot;a return to the terse guitar-drums-keyboard format of [Zevon&#x27;s] &#x27;70s albums.&quot; The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; considered it to be &quot;pure, earthy rock accessibly colored by Zevon&#x27;s typically wry imagery.&quot;

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;Zevon&#x27;s become a somewhat torpid renegade wailing away about his rebellion while safely ensconced in L.A. security.&quot; The &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; determined that &quot;Zevon&#x27;s first-person characters on this record are shocking, reprehensible and relentlessly slapstick.&quot;

<text>Babette&#x27;s Feast () is a 1987 Danish drama film directed by Gabriel Axel. The screenplay, written by Axel, was based on the 1958 story by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen). It was produced by Just Betzer, Bo Christensen and Benni Korzen, with funding from the Danish Film Institute. It stars Stéphane Audran, Birgitte Federspiel, and Bodil Kjer.

&quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim and became the first Danish film to win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also the first Danish cinema film of a Blixen story.

The film premiered in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
The elderly and pious Protestant sisters Martine and Filippa live in a small village on the remote western coast of Jutland in 19th-century Denmark. Their late father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle. Lacking new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling, elderly congregation.

Forty-nine years before, the sisters had many suitors, but their father rejected them, to retain the women’s assistance with his pastoral mission. Martine was courted by a young Swedish cavalry officer, Lorens Löwenhielm, who was visiting Jutland. Filippa was courted by the famous baritone Achille Papin, on hiatus from the Paris Opera. Both sisters spurned their suitors and stayed with their father.

Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant appears at their door. She carries a letter from Papin which explains that she is a refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris and recommends her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to employ Babette, but she begs to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next fourteen years, producing improved versions of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and gaining their respect, and that of the other locals. As the years go by, the sisters are deeply distressed by the increasing number of disputes between the congregants. Babette is also troubled, and at one point, interrupts the arguments with a stern rebuke.

Babette&#x27;s only link to her former life is a lottery ticket. A Parisian friend annually renews the ticket. One day, she wins the lottery and receives 10,000 francs. After her win she decides to prepare a dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor&#x27;s hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette&#x27;s appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice.

The sisters accept both Babette&#x27;s meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a &quot;real French dinner.&quot; Babette arranges for her nephew to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast. The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous and exotic, and their arrival causes much consternation and discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner.

Martine&#x27;s former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the Queen&#x27;s court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor&#x27;s congregation. He is unaware of the other guests&#x27; austere plans and as a man of the world and former attaché in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Café Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette&#x27;s gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgiven, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.

Bereft, the sisters assume that Babette will return to Paris. However, when she says that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Café Anglais, where a dinner for twelve cost 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, &quot;Now you will be poor the rest of your life&quot;, to which Babette replies, &quot;An artist is never poor.&quot; Filippa then says: &quot;But this is not the end, Babette. In paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be&quot; and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying: &quot;Oh, how you will enchant the angels!&quot;.

==Production==
Blixen&#x27;s original story takes place in the Norwegian port town of Berlevåg, albeit in an inaccurate setting of multi-coloured wooden houses on a long fjord. However, when Axel researched locations in Norway, he found the settings were too idyllic and resembled a &quot;beautiful tourist brochure&quot;. He shifted the location to the flat windswept coast of western Jutland and asked his set designer, Sven Wichmann, to build a small grey village offering very few or no attractions. Mårup Church, a plain Romanesque church built around 1250 on a remote seaside cliff near the village of Lønstrup, was used as a backdrop. Somewhat ironically, the actual village of Berlevåg is not on a fjord, but directly on the Barents Sea, and is subject to strong winds—very much similar to Axel&#x27;s vision.

Axel altered the setting from a ship-filled harbor to fishermen&#x27;s rowboats on a beach. He said the changes would highlight Blixen&#x27;s vision of Babette&#x27;s life in near complete exile.
The Nordisk Film production company suggested the cast of &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; should include only Danish actors to reduce production costs. However, Axel wanted Danish, Swedish and French actors to play the roles for the sake of authenticity. Axel was supported by the Danish Film Institute&#x27;s consultant, Claes Kastholm Hansen, who also agreed the cast should include international stars. The title character of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve was interested in the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual ‘sophisticated woman’ roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol&#x27;s films &quot;Violette Nozière&quot; (1978) and &quot;Cop au Vin&quot; (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran&#x27;s suitability, Chabrol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if she might be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.

Two other major parts were the characters of the elderly maiden sisters, Phillipa and Martine. Phillipa, the once-promising singer, was portrayed by Bodil Kjer, considered the first lady of Danish theater and namesake of the Bodil Award. Birgitte Federspiel, best known for Carl Dreyer&#x27;s 1955 classic film &quot;Ordet&quot;, was cast as the staid, lovelorn Martine.

The role of the Swedish General Lorens Löwenhielm, the former suitor of Martine, was accepted by Jarl Kulle and the Swedish Court Lady by Bibi Andersson. Both had achieved international recognition as two of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s favorite actors, appearing in many of his films.

The group of elderly villagers was composed of Danish actors, many of whom were well known for their roles in the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer. These included Lisbeth Movin as the Old Widow, Preben Lerdorff Rye as the Captain, Axel Strøbye as the Driver, Bendt Rothe as Old Nielsen and Ebbe Rode as Christopher.

The popular Danish actress Ghita Nørby was cast as the film&#x27;s narrator. Although production consultants complained to Axel that the use of a narrator was too old-fashioned, Axel was adamant about using one. He said it was not about being old-fashioned but only about the need: &quot;If there is need for a narrator, then one uses one.&quot;

==Menu==
The seven-course menu in the film consisted of:
* &quot;Potage à la Tortue&quot; (turtle soup) served with Amontillado sherry
* &quot;Blinis Demidoff&quot; (buckwheat pancakes with caviar and sour cream) served with Veuve Clicquot Champagne
* &quot;Cailles en Sarcophage&quot; (quail in puff pastry shell with foie gras and truffle sauce) served with Clos de Vougeot Pinot Noir
* An endive salad
* &quot;Savarin au Rhum avec des Figues et Fruit Glacée&quot; (rum sponge cake with figs and candied cherries) served with Champagne
* Assorted cheeses and fruits served with Sauternes
* Coffee with vieux marc Grande Champagne cognac.

&quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; was released on DVD by MGM on January 23, 2001, presented in its original 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio. The only special feature was the original theatrical trailer.

On July 23, 2013, the film was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray. The Blu-ray has a new, restored high-definition digital transfer, and features new video interviews with star Stéphane Audran, sociologist Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson, and a 1995 documentary about author Karen Blixen, as well as a booklet featuring an essay by film scholar Mark Le Fanu and Dinesen&#x27;s 1950 story.

==American remake==
In December 2019, it was announced that Alexander Payne had been asked to direct an American remake of the film. Payne&#x27;s version was planned to be set in Minnesota.

<text>Denis O&#x27;Brien (born 19 April 1958) is an Irish billionaire businessman, and the founder and owner of Digicel. He was listed among the World&#x27;s Top 200 Billionaires in 2015 and was Ireland&#x27;s richest native-born citizen for several years. His business interests have also extended to aircraft leasing (Aergo Capital), utilities support (Actavo), petroleum (Topaz Energy), football (a minority shareholder of Celtic F.C.), and healthcare (Beacon Hospital). As former chairman of the Esat Digifone consortium, O&#x27;Brien was questioned by the Moriarty Tribunal, which investigated the awarding of a mobile phone licence to Esat, among other things.

In 2021, O&#x27;Brien sold his stake in Communicorp and the Pacific operations of Digicel. O&#x27;Brien engages in various philanthropic activities, including being on the board of Concern Worldwide, founding the Iris O&#x27;Brien Foundation and establishing a fellowship at Boston College. In 2019, O&#x27;Brien earned the Award for Outstanding Achievement from the Irish-US Council.

== Early life ==
O&#x27;Brien was born on 19 April 1958 in Cork city. He has one brother and two sisters, and grew up in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin. His father created a medical supply company and later a horse nutrition business. As a child, Denis accompanied his father on business trips, where he learned how to close sales. He attended The High School in Rathgar, where he was once suspended for three months, until the school asked him back to participate in a rugby championship. His first job was as a hotel bellhop at age 14, and he started working on building cleaning jobs at 15.

In 1977, O&#x27;Brien received a BA in politics, history and logic at University College Dublin. While attending UCD, he received a scholarship to attend Boston College, where he completed an MBA.

== Career ==
=== Early stages ===
Upon his return to Dublin, O&#x27;Brien was employed at a small investment bank, Trinity Bank, but he left that job to become a personal assistant to Tony Ryan, owner of an aircraft leasing company.

=== Communications and media ===
O&#x27;Brien has spent most of his career in the communications technology and mass media industries. He has also been a part owner of energy, aerospace, and industrial service companies.

====Communicorp====

O&#x27;Brien was until early 2021 the owner of Communicorp, a media holding company operating across Europe. He started the company in Ireland in 1989, where it has owned independent radio stations like Newstalk and Today FM. The company expanded to markets in Eastern European countries, later selling some of its stations to local operators. In 2014, Communicorp expanded to the United Kingdom, acquiring eight radio stations across the country; in 2017, Communicorp moved its UK radio stations to a new independent company, Communicorp UK, of which O&#x27;Brien owns 98% of the shares. In February 2021, O&#x27;Brien sold Communicorp to Bauer Media Audio for approximately €100 million.

==== Esat Telecom and Esat Digifone ====

In 1991, O&#x27;Brien formed a telecommunications consortium called Esat Telecom to compete with the state-owned Telecom Eireann. In partnership with Telenor, Norway&#x27;s state telecom operator, Esat formed Esat Digifone, which made a successful bid for Ireland&#x27;s second GSM mobile licence. Circumstances around the awarding of the licence to Esat Digifone became the subject of the Moriarty Tribunal.

On 7 November 1997, Esat Telecom Group plc held an initial public offering and was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ. In 2000, Telenor made a bid for control of the company, but O&#x27;Brien sold it to BT, reportedly making €250 million from the sale.

====Aergo Capital====
In 1999, O&#x27;Brien co-founded aircraft leasing company Aergo Capital, in which he owned an 80% stake. From its inception until 2014, Aergo traded more than 150 aircraft with a gross value of over €791 million (approximately $1 billion). In October 2014, O&#x27;Brien and his partner, Fred Browne, sold the company to CarVal, a US investment firm; Browne remained with the new company as CEO.

====Independent News &amp; Media====

In the late 2000s, O&#x27;Brien began purchasing shares of Independent News &amp; Media (INM), ultimately spending an estimated €500 million to amass a 29.9% stake in the company. O&#x27;Brien clashed with the company&#x27;s board, especially former owner Tony O&#x27;Reilly, who stepped down from his position as CEO in 2009 and sold most of his INM shares in 2014. In April 2019, O&#x27;Brien and Dermont Desmond, INM&#x27;s second largest shareholder at the time, sold their shares to the Belgian media group Mediahuis; O&#x27;Brien reportedly received €43.5m as part of the deal.

Although he never owned a majority stake in INM, O&#x27;Brien was at times accused of exerting significant influence at the company. In 2014, allegations arose that Stephen Rae, a group editor at INM, ordered amendments to a column by &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; editor Anne Harris that contained references to O&#x27;Brien. In 2015, Paul Meagher, a solicitor for O&#x27;Brien, reportedly called INM solicitor Simon McAleese in 2012 to block a story related to environment minister Phil Hogan.

In March 2018, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) in Ireland applied to the High Court of Ireland to appoint inspectors to Independent News and Media to investigate an alleged data breach. According to an affidavit filed by the ODCE, invoices for the data interrogation were discharged by Blaydon Limited.

In June 2019, Independent News &amp; Media was sold to the Belgian group Mediahuis and de-listed from the Euronext Dublin exchange, thus ending O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s involvement in the group. It was reported that he lost in excess of €450m in total on his INM investment.

====Digicel====

In 2001, O&#x27;Brien founded Digicel, a telecom company that operates in the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia Pacific. Using the cash from his sale of Esat Telecom, O&#x27;Brien used Digicel to build a wireless network in Jamaica. That same year, Digicel expanded into the South Pacific. As of 2022, Digicel operates in 25 countries.

Along with Digicel, O&#x27;Brien created the Digicel Foundation, which has worked with local organizations to develop community services, build schools and health centers, and support recovery efforts. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, O&#x27;Brien pledged €3.5 million to assist recovery efforts. In 2012, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded O&#x27;Brien with the National Order of Honour and Merit for his investments, contributions and promotion of the country, and in 2015, O&#x27;Brien received honorary membership of the Order of Jamaica for his service to the country&#x27;s telecommunications industry.

In May 2020, Digicel filed for bankruptcy court reorganization and successfully sought a debt restructuring agreement. A debt exchange was approved by the company&#x27;s bondholders and took place in June 2020. As part of the exchange, O&#x27;Brien agreed to contribute $50 million of assets to Digicel, including $25 million in cash and the company&#x27;s Jamaican headquarters.

In October 2021, Digicel announced the sale of its Pacific operations to Telstra Corp, an Australian telecommunications company. Valued at US$1.85 billion, the sale was completed in July 2022, with Telstra agreeing to pay Digicel US$1.6 billion before adjustments and deductions. Telstra purchased all six Digicel Pacific markets, including Fiji, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu.

====Actavo====
In 2012, O&#x27;Brien purchased Siteserv, a utilities support company, from IBRC for €45m; in 2015, the company was renamed Actavo. Actavo was bought and controlled through O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s firm Millington on the Isle of Man.

In 2016, Actavo expanded into the United States through the purchase of Atlantic Engineering Services, a structural engineering firm. Actavo was also involved in the installation of fibre networks for Digicel in the Caribbean.

====Topaz Energy====
In December 2013, O&#x27;Brien purchased €300 million in debt owed by Topaz Energy to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. In December 2014, Topaz&#x27;s parent company, Kendrick Investments, announced it would buy all of Esso&#x27;s Irish operations.

In December 2015, Alimentation Couche-Tard, a Canadian convenience store company, announced that it planned to buy Topaz. The sale was completed in February 2016; Topaz had more than 2,000 employees and close to 35% of the consumer market in Ireland at the time of the sale.

==== Davos and bank directorships ====
O&#x27;Brien has attended the World Economic Forum&#x27;s annual winter meeting in Davos, Switzerland, alongside other billionaires like Bill Gates and George Soros.

In 2000, O&#x27;Brien became a director of the Bank of Ireland, and in September 2005, he was named a deputy governor of the bank. In September 2006, he resigned as both deputy governor and as a member of the bank&#x27;s court (board). O&#x27;Brien reportedly resigned due to increased demands related to his international business interests.

==== Football ====
O&#x27;Brien considered purchasing Doncaster Rovers in the early 2000&#x27;s, having owned the club&#x27;s ground &quot;Belle Vue&quot; since 1998.

Between 2008 and 2016, O&#x27;Brien gave the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) as much as €12 million to help pay the salaries of senior officials within the organisation, including Giovanni Trapattoni. In 2018, O&#x27;Brien was named Honorary Life President of the FAI.

In 2006, O&#x27;Brien purchased a 2.82% stake in Glasgow-based Celtic F.C. from a former manager of the club, Martin O&#x27;Neill. As of June 2018, O&#x27;Brien reportedly had increased his ownership to 13%.

==== Other business interests ====
In 1998, O&#x27;Brien purchased Planal SA, the holding company for the Quinta do Lago golf resort in Algarve, Portugal.

== Moriarty Tribunal ==

In 1997, the Moriarty Tribunal was established to look into allegations against two Irish politicians, Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry. After 14 years, the Tribunal&#x27;s final report found, among other things, that Lowry, Ireland&#x27;s then energy and communications minister, assisted O&#x27;Brien in his bid to secure a mobile phone contract for Esat Digifone. The tribunal found that this happened after Fine Gael received a $50,000 donation from O&#x27;Brien via a circuitous route, although the tribunal also acknowledged that the money was not intended as a payment. However, because the Tribunal was not a court of law, its findings were legally &quot;sterile&quot;.

In 2018, Michael Lowry won an appeal over the Moriarty Tribunal&#x27;s legal costs. The appeal judges awarded Lowry 80% of his costs for the legal battle. That same year, the High Court ruled that the State was not entitled to indemnity and contribution from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s telecommunications company regarding any loss that might arise from the granting of the country&#x27;s second mobile phone licence in 1996. In 2021, the High Court upheld the 2018 ruling after the State attempted to appeal it. Three judges unanimously dismissed the appeal and stated that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s telecommunications company was entitled to the legal costs of the appeal.

Sam Smyth, a radio show host that aired on one of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s networks, claimed he was fired as a result of his reporting on the Moriarty Tribunal. Today FM responded to the claim, stating that &quot;the decision was made to address a decline in listenership and was part of an initiative to improve programming quality.&quot; The Today FM board supported the decision, which was one of several programming changes made by Willy O&#x27;Reilly.

==Relationship with the media==
In 2012, O&#x27;Brien threatened to sue journalist and broadcaster Vincent Browne over statements in Browne&#x27;s articles that O&#x27;Brien claimed were defamatory.

In February 2013, O&#x27;Brien sued the &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot; for defamation over his numerous appearances in RTÉ news reports on the relief effort after the Haiti earthquake. The court awarded O&#x27;Brien €150,000. The case was the first time a journalist had attempted to use the honest opinion defence before a jury at the High Court since the Defamation Act 2009 became law.

In August 2015, the editor-in-chief of the satirical website &quot;Waterford Whispers News&quot;, Colm Williamson received a cease and desist order from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s solicitor to remove a satirical article about O&#x27;Brien. Lawyers for O&#x27;Brien also demanded that a reprint of the story be removed from Broadsheet.ie. Waterford Whispers News subsequently removed the article.

In 2019, O&#x27;Brien began an action for defamation against the Sunday Business Post over articles published in the newspaper in March 2015. The articles, which centred around a confidential PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report given to the government in November 2008 on the exposure of Ireland&#x27;s banks in 2008, identified O&#x27;Brien as being among the 22 biggest borrowers from Irish banks in 2008. O&#x27;Brien claimed the articles defamed him and injured his reputation and also alleged malicious publication. The jury found in the defendant&#x27;s favour and Justice Barton dismissed the case with an order for costs against O&#x27;Brien.

==Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) debt==
Through the acquisitions of Siteserv and Topaz Energy, O&#x27;Brien at one time held hundreds of millions of Euros in debt from the state-owned IBRC. In February 2013, the IBRC went into liquidation, and shortly thereafter, O&#x27;Brien asked for an extension to repay an outstanding €320m in loans. O&#x27;Brien claimed that he had previously received verbal confirmation for a loan extension from former IBRC CEO Mike Aynsley, but Aynsley&#x27;s position was terminated when the bank went into liquidation.

The matter became public in May 2015, when TD Catherine Murphy attempted to raise it in the Dáil Éireann. According to Murphy, O&#x27;Brien allegedly wrote to the IBRC&#x27;s special liquidator, Kieran Wallace, seeking the repayment terms he had verbally secured from Aynsley; both Aynsley and O&#x27;Brien denied the claims.

On 16 June 2015, O&#x27;Brien sued the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Government of Ireland and the Attorney General over remarks made by Murphy and Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty about his banking affairs in the Dáil Éireann. O&#x27;Brien alleged that the remarks were a breach of parliamentary privilege that violated his constitutional rights and his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Oireachtas Committee on Procedures and Privileges previously rejected O&#x27;Briens request to sanction Murphy over her allegations about his financial arrangements, which he claimed had breached parliamentary privilege.

===RTÉ injunction===
In 2015, O&#x27;Brien and Kieran Wallace, the special liquidator who oversaw the liquidation of IBRC, successfully applied for an injunction in Ireland&#x27;s High Court preventing RTÉ from airing a report about his receipt of a low interest rate on loans from the IBRC. Justice Donald Binchy, the High Court judge who granted the injunction, said that the public did not have the right to see confidential banking information of IBRC customers, and that RTÉ had failed to prove that the terms of the loan were handled improperly by the IBRC.

After the judgment, several media outlets reported that Catherine Murphy had spoken, but did not provide any quotes or clips from her speech. &quot;The Independent&quot;, owned by Independent News &amp; Media, of which O&#x27;Brien then held a significant interest, reported, &quot;Mr. O&#x27;Brien successfully stopped RTÉ from broadcasting&quot; details about O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s finances that Murphy had raised in the Daíl. Several Irish media outlets ignored the injunction by publishing Murphy&#x27;s comments or referring to their publication on the Oireachtas website.

In mid-June 2015, Justice Binchy ruled that most of RTÉ&#x27;s report on Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s financial relationship with the IBRC could be published. On 17 June 2015, RTÉ published what it called &quot;a curtailed version&quot; of the story, claiming that two paragraphs of the original story could not be printed because they were still covered by the High Court&#x27;s injunction. The article was accompanied by a timeline of events between February and June 2013.

O&#x27;Brien defended the injunction in an &quot;Irish Times&quot; op-ed piece, stating that he had been shocked that somebody took confidential files from a bank, altered them, and then leaked them to the press. He claimed to have been vilified by enemies, competitors, politicians, and others for trying to defend his privacy.

===IBRC Commission of investigation ===

On 10 June 2015, a Commission of investigation was established to inquire into IBRC transactions that lost €10 million or more between 21 January 2009 and 7 February 2013. The commission was initially chaired by retired High Court Judge Daniel O&#x27;Keeffe, but in July 2015, Judge Brian Cregan replaced Judge O&#x27;Keeffe as the commission&#x27;s chair and sole member. The terms of the commission were updated in 2016 to focus first on IBRC&#x27;s sale of Siteserv to O&#x27;Brien in 2012, based on claims by TD Catherine Murphy in the Daíl Éireann; Murphy was asked to appear before the commission in February 2019, several months after criticising the amount of time it had taken the commission to complete its inquiry, but as of May 2019, she had not made herself available for testimony. In November 2019, Murphy announced that she would not appear before the commission because she was concerned that she would be required to reveal the source of her information.

In September 2022, the commission released its final report on its investigation into the sale of Siteserv. The report stated that while the sale was &quot;carried out in good faith,&quot; it was &quot;based on misleading and incomplete information.&quot; However, the report went on to say that there was no evidence that O&#x27;Brien received favourable interest rates from the bank, as alleged by Catherine Murphy. It also stated that O&#x27;Brien was not at fault for going on a trip with Robert Dix, and there was no evidence to support the claim that O&#x27;Brien had an unduly close or unethical relationship with senior IBRC executives.

==Recognition==
O&#x27;Brien received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from his alma mater, UCD, in 2006.

In 2019, the Irish-US Council awarded O&#x27;Brien the 2019 Award for Outstanding Achievement for his work building bonds between Ireland and the United States.

==Personal life==
In August 1997, O&#x27;Brien married Catherine Walsh, who helped Communicorp expand into the Czech Republic and who earlier was the head of marketing for Independent Radio Sales. The couple have four children. One of his three sisters is the artist Abigail O&#x27;Brien, President of Irish arts body, the Royal Hibernian Academy, for 2018–2023.

=== Sponsorships and causes===
In June 2000, O&#x27;Brien set up the Iris O&#x27;Brien Foundation, named after his mother, through which he coordinates many of his philanthropic efforts, and has supported multiple charities and campaign groups, including the human rights group &quot;Front Line Defenders&quot;. Front Line Defenders was co-founded by O&#x27;Brien in 2001, to help protect human rights defenders globally, and O&#x27;Brien remains its chairman .

O&#x27;Brien supported the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games, for which he was the chairman of the Games Organising Committee and later the Chairman of the Council of Patrons. In 2004, O&#x27;Brien helped to establish the Digicel Foundation, which has funded thousands of projects in the Caribbean and Pacific.

As of 2012, O&#x27;Brien was a member of the United States board of Concern Worldwide, a humanitarian aid organisation. O&#x27;Brien has worked with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, O&#x27;Brien worked with CGI&#x27;s Haiti Action Network and the Digicel Haiti Foundation to help rebuild the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince. In 2010, O&#x27;Brien was named a goodwill ambassador for the city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, by Mayor Jean Yves Jason, who cited O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s help with disaster recovery efforts after the earthquake. In 2012, O&#x27;Brien received a Clinton Global Citizen Award from former U.S. President Bill Clinton, in large part due to his disaster relief efforts in Haiti. He also contributed to building 50 primary and secondary schools in the 18 months following the earthquake. In September 2016, then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sent a campaign email criticising Hillary Clinton&#x27;s relationship with O&#x27;Brien, about which O&#x27;Brien declined to comment.

In 2015, O&#x27;Brien established a fully-funded fellowship for Irish students to receive an MBA degree from Boston College. O&#x27;Brien has also been a member of the Trilateral Commission.

O&#x27;Brien donated €2,500 to the campaign of independent candidate Mary Davis for the 2011 Irish presidential election.

===Wealth and residences===
As of February 2020, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s wealth to be approximately $3.2 billion.

Sometime after his purchase of Quinta do Lago in 1998, but before Esat Telecom&#x27;s sale to BT in 2000, O&#x27;Brien sold his home in Dublin and established a primary residence in Portugal. Media reports suggested that the move was spurred by a then-existing exemption to capital gains tax in the Irish-Portuguese tax treaty, which reportedly would have saved O&#x27;Brien about €63 million in taxes. However, in 2013, the High Court officially ruled that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s home was Quinta de Lago, Almancil, Portugal, and not Ireland, in the 2000/2001 tax year.

While considering the flotation of Digicel on the New York Stock Exchange, a March 2006 filing to the Companies Registration Office (CRO) listed O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s residential address as Sliema, Malta.

<doc id="979834" wikidata="Q3526736" url="?curid=979834" title="Combinatorial group theory">
<text>In mathematics, combinatorial group theory is the theory of free groups, and the concept of a presentation of a group by generators and relations. It is much used in geometric topology, the fundamental group of a simplicial complex having in a natural and geometric way such a presentation.
A very closely related topic is geometric group theory, which today largely subsumes combinatorial group theory, using techniques from outside combinatorics besides.

It also comprises a number of algorithmically insoluble problems, most notably the word problem for groups; and the classical Burnside problem.

== History ==
See the book by Chandler and Magnus for a detailed history of combinatorial group theory.

A proto-form is found in the 1856 icosian calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, where he studied the icosahedral symmetry group via the edge graph of the dodecahedron.

The foundations of combinatorial group theory were laid by Walther von Dyck, student of Felix Klein, in the early 1880s, who gave the first systematic study of groups by generators and relations.

<text>The City Hall in Haarlem is the seat of the city&#x27;s government. It was built in the 14th century replacing the Count&#x27;s castle.

==History==
A wooden structure was erected on the site of the current Gravenzaal of the City Hall around 1100. In 1955, remnants of this structure were discovered.

After large fires in 1347 and 1351, William I, Duke of Bavaria who was also the Count of Holland at that time, donated the remains of the Gravenzaal to the city&#x27;s municipality. A new building was built there. The central square building dates from the Middle Ages, but the distinctive façade of the building was designed by architect Lieven de Key and built from 1602-1604. The way it originally looked can be seen in a painting from 1460 by the Master of Bellaert. Originally the city hall was just the front of the building, and the rear cloister belonged to the Dominican brotherhood. After the Protestant Reformation this came into the possession of the city council and it is now a large complex with offices and meeting rooms. Both the Frans Hals Museum and the Haarlem Public Library originally were located in the city hall.

The town hall is still used for civic weddings and nearly every Friday in Spring, brides can be seen entering and leaving by the main stairway. All year on Saturdays and Mondays there is a big market in front of the City Hall, where on Saturdays mainly flowers, household goods, and food is sold, though on Mondays the products are mainly cloth, sewing accessories and clothing. Although the market is frequented by the local population, it is also a tourist attraction and worth a visit, if only to try the raw herring from the fish stand, or &quot;stroopwafels&quot; from the stroopwafel stand. The town hall is also still used for state visits, most recently when the King and Queen paid a visit to Haarlem on 14 June 2013. They heard the local choir &quot;Zang en Vriendschap&quot; sing and received a book about all the previous royal state visits to Haarlem. 

The town hall was traditionally a gathering place for various gentlemen, and the Dutch Society of Science started meeting there in 1752, which was the beginning of a municipal museum for natural history, that today no longer exists, though its &quot;competitor&quot; founded in 1781 still does; namely the Teylers Museum. When they moved out, the paintings stayed and they became the Haarlem municipal museum, which moved out in 1913 to become the Frans Hals museum.
==Inside==
A large number of paintings and objects from Haarlem&#x27;s rich history can be found inside the building. One series of paintings depict the various counts of Holland, starting from Dirk I to Maximilian from Austria. In the Middle Ages these paintings were hanging in the Carmelieten Cloister in Haarlem; they were painted between 1486 and 1491. In 1570 it is mentioned in city archives that the paintings were hanging in the City Hall; possibly they were moved there in 1566 to protect them from the iconoclastic riots. Other paintings and objects are either part of the original interior, or too big to fit in the Frans Hals Museum.

<text>The Treaty of Montgomery was an Anglo-Welsh treaty signed on 29 September 1267 in Montgomeryshire by which Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was acknowledged as Prince of Wales by King Henry III of England (r. 1216–1272). It was the only time an English ruler recognised the right of a ruler of Gwynedd over Wales. Llywelyn&#x27;s grandfather Llywelyn the Great had previously laid claim to be the effective prince of Wales by using the title &quot;Prince of Aberffraw, Lord of Snowdon&quot; in the 1230s, after subduing all the other Welsh dynasties. Likewise Llywelyn&#x27;s uncle, Dafydd ap Llywelyn, claimed the title of Prince of Wales during his reign from 1240 to 1246. However, Llywelyn&#x27;s supremacy in the late 1260s forced recognition of his authority in Wales by an English Crown weakened by internal division.

==Conditions of the treaty==

Many of the conditions of the treaty had been anticipated by the Treaty of Pipton (1265) between Llywelyn and Simon de Montfort. The 1267 treaty ceded Builth to Llywelyn, along with Brecon and Gwerthrynion in mid-Wales. The disputed castle of Cefnllys, which Llywelyn had taken from Roger Mortimer in 1262, was restored to Roger with the condition that the land would be tentatively held from Llywelyn, provided Llywelyn could affirm his right to it. Llywelyn was also granted Whittington Castle in modern-day Shropshire, previously held by his grandfather in the 1220s, and received an assurance that no castle would be built at Hawarden for sixty years by Robert of Mold, thus helping to secure the north-eastern border of Wales. The treaty also allowed for the reinstatement of Llywelyn&#x27;s brother, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, into Welsh society after his defection to England in the early 1260s.

The key text would be seen later by the Lord Edward as

&quot;XIII. For the principality, lands, homages and grants the prince and his successors will be bound to give fealty, homage and service to the king and his heirs, which he or his predecessors have been accustomed and obliged to give the kings of England.&quot;

==Implications==

Though the treaty required Llywelyn to do homage to the king of England for the land, it was in effect an acknowledgement of the power and authority of the prince. However, after the succession of Edward I as king of England in 1272, relations between England and Wales deteriorated, and Edward declared war on Llywelyn in 1276; the Treaty of Aberconwy of 1277 superseded the stipulations laid down at Montgomery and severely curbed Llywelyn&#x27;s power. In December 1282, fifteen years after the original treaty, the army of Montgomery marched to Builth Wells from Montgomery Castle, to surprise and kill Llywelyn. After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century, the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front line fortress.

<text>The 2001 Copa América was held in Colombia, from 11 to 29 July. It was organised by CONMEBOL, South America&#x27;s football governing body. Colombia won the tournament for the 1st time without conceding a goal.

Brazil were the two-time defending champions, but they were knocked out of the tournament by Honduras after suffering a 0–2 defeat in the quarter-final.

There is no qualifying for the final tournament. CONMEBOL&#x27;s ten South American countries participate, along with two more invited countries, making a total of twelve teams competing in the tournament. Originally, Mexico and CONCACAF Champions Canada were invited.

Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia. On 1 July they announced the cancellation of the tournament. Venezuela offered to host the competition, but on 6 July CONMEBOL decided to reinstate the plans for Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule.

When the tournament was originally cancelled, Canada disbanded its training camp and Canadian players returned to their club teams. The Canadian Soccer Association announced they would not be able to participate in the reinstated tournament. With only a few days&#x27; notice, Costa Rica (CONCACAF) accepted an invite to take Canada&#x27;s spot in the tournament. The Costa Ricans advanced to the knockout stage, losing in the quarterfinals.

Complaining about the sudden reversal, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the Argentine Football Association decided to withdraw from the competition on 10 July, in spite of Colombian authorities proposing to implement additional protection measures. With the tournament starting the next day, Honduras (CONCACAF) were invited, arriving with barely enough players on 13 July in an airplane provided by the Colombian Air Force, after the tournament had started and just a few hours before its first game. The Hondurans performed well through the tournament, finishing in third place.

Despite the pre-tournament concerns, there were no incidents of violence nor acts of assault towards any of the participating nations.

<text>Tyrone Davis (born Tyrone D. Fettson or Tyrone D. Branch, October 3, 1937 – February 9, 2005) (although many sources have his date of birth as May 4, 1938), was an American blues and soul singer with a long list of hit records over more than 20 years. Davis had three number 1 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart: &quot;Can I Change My Mind&quot; (1968), &quot;Turn Back the Hands of Time&quot; (1970), and &quot;Turning Point&quot; (1975).

==Biography==
Tyrone Fettson was born in Greenville, Mississippi, United States, to Willie Branch and Ora Lee Jones. Some sources give his date of birth as May 4, 1938, but researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state that his funeral notice gives the October 1937 date.

He moved with his father to Saginaw, Michigan, before moving to Chicago in 1959. Working as a valet/chauffeur for blues singer Freddie King, he started singing in local clubs where he was discovered by record executive/musician Harold Burrage. His early records for small record labels in the city, billed as &quot;Tyrone the Wonder Boy&quot;, failed to register. Successful Chicago record producer Carl Davis signed him in 1968 to a new label, Dakar Records, that he was starting as part of a distribution deal with Atlantic, and suggested that Tyrone change his name, which he did by borrowing Carl&#x27;s last name.

His first release, &quot;A Woman Needs to Be Loved&quot; was flipped when the B-side started to get radio attention. The song, &quot;Can I Change My Mind&quot; featured a change of vocal style for Davis with a softer, more pleading approach and tone. The record shot up the listings and spent three weeks on the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, while climbing to number 5 in the Hot 100. It sold over one million and received gold disc recognition. His biggest hit came in early 1970 when &quot;Turn Back The Hands Of Time&quot; also reached number 1 in the R&amp;B chart and went up to number 3 in the Hot 100 pop chart. Written by Jack Daniels and Bonnie Thompson, this disc also sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America in May 1970.

Davis released about 25 singles during his seven years with Dakar, most of them big R&amp;B sellers produced by Willie Henderson. He finally returned to the top spot with &quot;Turning Point&quot; in 1975. Soon afterwards, Davis switched to the major Columbia record label and recorded seven albums over the next five years with producer Leo Graham and arranger James Mack who had collaborated with him for &quot;Turning Point.&quot; Major hits with Columbia included &quot;Give It Up&quot; (number 2), &quot;This I Swear&quot; (number 6), and &quot;In the Mood&quot; (number 6). Dubbed the &quot;king of romantic Chicago soul&quot; by MTV, Davis&#x27; perceived vulnerability and class endeared him to female soul fans through the 1970s.

1982 brought a change of label to the newly established independent, Highrise and another major hit, &quot;Are You Serious&quot; (number 3 R&amp;B, number 57 pop), again produced by Leo Graham, and written by L.V. Johnson. When Highrise closed the following year, Davis switched to a tiny Los Angeles label, Ocean Front, which lacked promotional muscle to get behind arguably one of his best performances, &quot;Let Me Be Your Pacifier.&quot; In 1991, Davis switched to Atlanta label, Ichiban Records, recording three albums including the song &quot;Mom&#x27;s Apple Pie.&quot; In 1994, Davis went to Bellmark/Life Records for one album. Davis&#x27; days as a major chart act were over, but he continued to be a popular live attraction and finally signed in 1996 with Malaco Records, the southern-based blues label recording him on a number of albums. He also performed on a PBS special on 1970s soul music in 2004, singing &quot;Turn Back the Hands of Time.&quot;

A stroke in September 2004 ended his career and, following complications, he died in a Chicago hospital on February 9, 2005, at the age of 67.

<text>King Abdulaziz Air Base () , also known as Dhahran Air Base and formerly Dhahran International Airport, Dhahran Airport and Dhahran Airfield, is a Royal Saudi Air Force base located in Dhahran in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Located west of Thuqbah and 7 km (4 mi) southeast of the Saudi Aramco Dhahran Camp, the airbase was the first Saudi Arabian airport to be constructed, in 1961, and is under the command of Air vice-marshal Prince Turki bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.

The airbase was initially built and operated by the United States Air Force from 1945 until 1962 and was known as the Dhahran Airfield. After use by the USAF, it was converted for commercial use and was known as the Dhahran International Airport, and was shared with the King Abdulaziz Air Base of the Royal Saudi Air Force. The military relationship that exists today between the United States and Saudi Arabia was highly influenced by the origin and development of this airfield.

During its commercial use phase, from 1962 to 1999, it was one of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s busiest passenger airports and was commemorated on the 2nd issue 5-riyal banknotes and the 3rd issue 1-riyal banknotes. After the completion and inauguration of the King Fahd International Airport further north, the airport lost its commercial status and once again reverted to military use only; albeit by the Royal Saudi Air Force, which still uses it today.

==History==
During World War II, the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula were important staging and shipping routes for the U.S. to provide both lend-lease assistance to the Soviet Union, as well as supply the allied forces fighting the Imperial Japanese forces in Asia.

Owing to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s importance, primarily its location, in 1943 the US extended lend-lease status to Saudi Arabia, one of only three Arab countries to receive this aid. In 1944, the U.S. War Department (renamed in 1949 the United States Department of Defense) proposed building an airbase in or near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

In 1945, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia signed the Dhahran Air Field Agreement. This agreement permitted the U.S. to build a small air field near the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) town. The use of the term &quot;air field&quot;, as opposed to &quot;air base&quot; was a direct result of U.S. sensitivity of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s concerns regarding imperialism. Further, full ownership of the airfield was scheduled to revert to Saudi Arabia at the conclusion of the war, after an agreed-upon three-year period during which the U.S. would have the rights to operate the field.

Despite the end of World War II in the European theater, in 1945, President Harry S. Truman signed the Agreement, which owing to the lack of any military justification, and again a reflection of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s concerns regarding imperialism and the symbolism of foreign bases on their soil, was promptly rejected by the King. The War Department, likewise, dropped their support of the project. However, the U.S. State Department, recognizing the economic benefits of this location, and the diplomatic benefits afforded by the agreement, continued to pursue development of the Dhahran Air Field. After Congress approved substantial economic development assistance, the U.S. State Department and the Saudi Government agreed, in August 1945, to develop the air field. The War Department was forced to foot the cost of the construction.

In 1948, when the originally agreed-upon three-year post-war period of U.S. operations came to a close, the agreement was renegotiated. While the airfield had not been completed until 1946, too late to be of any benefit for World War II logistics (its original justification) it did provide benefits in the late 1940s, specifically in the context of the increasing tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In 1949 Dhahran airfield was the only airfield in the area which could support the United States Air Force (USAF)’s B-29s. Thus, the airfield took on increasing importance in the U.S.’s eyes as one location in the U.S. strategy of the containment of communism. For Saudi Arabia, the base provided an element of security from the U.S. forces posted there, among Saudi Arabia&#x27;s growing concerns regarding their neighbors, particularly Yemen, and the Hashemites of Iraq and Transjordan. The 1948 agreement reverted ownership of the air base to Saudi Arabia, and on-going year-to-year leases, for which the U.S. would pay rent.

On 18 June 1951, the two governments signed an agreement renewing and extending USAF usage rights at the airfield.

In a further renewal agreement dated 2 April 1957, the U.S. pledged to provide construction support to help the Saudis improve their commercial air facilities at the Dhahran Civil Air Terminal and to assist,
advise, and train the Saudi Army, Navy, and Air Force. To accomplish the tasks of assistance and training, the United States redesignated the Military Assistance and Advisory Group, in Saudi Arabia since 1949, as the United States Military Training Mission (USMTM). The USMTM staff, with headquarters at the Dhahran terminal, consisted of three sections representing the American armed services. Each section worked with the corresponding Saudi military service.

===Civilian===


Through the 1950s, the Dhahran airfield began to emerge as a commercial transportation hub, as the nearby Dammam oil fields increased the overall economic viability of the area. Additionally, Trans World Airlines began using Dhahran as a hub for increasing transport to and from Asia and Europe. The Dhahran airfield and the emerging support facilities became Dhahran International Airport in 1961, shortly before the United States relinquished control in 1962.

The airport terminal building is one of the architectural works of Minoru Yamasaki and was completed in 1961. The architecture is a blending of traditional Islamic forms with modern technology. For example, the flight control tower has the appearance of a minaret. Images of the terminal have been used on Saudi banknotes and is viewed as having influenced the design of a number of important buildings throughout the Middle East.

In February 1979, Pan Am commenced a route to New York City using Boeing 747SPs. The passengers included Americans who worked for Aramco and Saudis studying at universities in the United States. The service ceased in February 1986; Pan Am had sold its 747SPs and did not possess another aircraft that could operate the flights nonstop.

Dhahran served a significant role in the 1994 evacuation of U.S. citizens and personnel from Yemen when that country slid into civil war. During Operation Desert Focus in 1996, after the bombing of the Khobar Towers, the airport was used to relocate over 6,000 U.S. citizens and personnel within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Dhahran airfield continued to serve as the Eastern Province&#x27;s commercial air hub until the completion, in 1999, of the King Fahd International Airport near Dammam, when all scheduled flights were shifted out of Dhahran International Airport.

===Military===
King Abdul-Aziz Air Base has been a major RSAF airbase since the USAF left in 1962, providing air defence, tactical and strategic support for the Eastern Province and nearby regions, as well as providing aviation related technical training to RSAF personnel.

Between 1963 and 1999 the base was called Dhahran Air Base.

Between 17 September 1963 and 20 November 1963 the United States Air Force&#x27;s 524th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed here with North American F-100 Super Sabres.

====The Gulf War====

A detachment of Royal Air Force Panavia Tornado GR1&#x27;s from No. 31 Squadron RAF were based here during January 1991.

====1990s====
During October 1994 the USAF 75th Fighter Squadron (A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft) was moved to Dhahran Air Base, prior to forward deployment to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait.

In 1999, Dhahran Air Base was renamed King Abdulaziz Air Base.

==Current use==
Dhahran International Airport has been transformed into a military airbase. It has been renamed King Abdulaziz Air Base and serves the purposes of the Royal Saudi Air Force. There are also a couple of VIP airlines that operate out of DHA: Aviation-Link operates one A319 and B777-200, and NEXUS Flight Operations operates one A319.
* RSAF 3 Wing:

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On October 19, 1950 a Douglas DC-3 crashed on takeoff from the airbase, killing one person on board and damaging the aircraft beyond repair.
* On December 30, 1956 a United States Air Force Military Air Transport Service Lockheed C-121 Constellation en route from Tripoli crashed on approach to the airfield, killing 12 of 38 on board. The cause was determined to be a combination of the inoperativity of Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) and poor visibility due to fog. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On April 17, 1964 Middle East Airlines Flight 444, a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III carrying 42 passengers and 7 crew, crashed 7 km offshore in the Half Moon Bay, approaching Dhahran International Airport from the south. The cause of the crash remains undetermined. All people on board lost their lives in the crash.
* On July 8, 1968, a Saudia Convair CV-340 carrying 11 people en route from Bahrain International Airport crashed 5 km (3 mi) south of the airport while attempting approach for the third time due to poor visibility caused by a sandstorm.
* On March 17, 1985, a Saudia Boeing 737-200 carrying 76 passengers and 21 crew from Jeddah to Riyadh was hijacked by a lone man armed with a grenade. After commandeering the aircraft up to Riyadh, the hijacker demanded to be flown to another destination, after which he was told that the aircraft would need to refuel in Dhahran. After letting everyone on the plane except the pilots disembark, the man was asked to surrender to security forces, which he refused to do. Subsequently, the aircraft was stormed; the man threw the grenade and was shot and killed.

<doc id="979893" wikidata="Q522988" url="?curid=979893" title="Alan White (Oasis drummer)">
<text>Alan Victor &quot;Whitey&quot;White (born 26 May 1972) is an English drummer, best known as the drummer of the rock band Oasis from 1995 to 2004. Before Oasis, he was the drummer of Starclub from 1991 to 1994. He joined the band in April 1995 after the band&#x27;s original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed, and is the longest-serving drummer in Oasis&#x27;s history, performing on four studio albums, a B-side compilation, and one live album during his tenure. He was recommended to Noel Gallagher by Gallagher&#x27;s friend Paul Weller. Notably, Alan&#x27;s brother, Steve, had been a longtime drummer for Weller. White left Oasis in early 2004 and was replaced by Zak Starkey, drummer of The Who and son of The Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr.

==Career==
===Idha, Starclub and Dr Robert (1987–1995)===
In 1988, White auditioned to join future Oasis member Gem Archer&#x27;s band Whirlpool. &quot;He came down and just blew us all away,&quot; remembers Archer. &quot;I thought he was mega but the others were worried what a 15-years-old kid on the road and on the lager would be like. I rang his dad and told him: &#x27;Sorry. But don&#x27;t worry he&#x27;s fantastic. He&#x27;ll go all the way.&#x27; And he did. It was the weirdest day when he welcomed me to Oasis. And he hasn&#x27;t let me forget it.&quot; White also played drums on Andy Bell&#x27;s wife Idha&#x27;s debut solo studio album &quot;Melody Inn&quot;, forming a connection with another future Oasis member. It was at this session that Noel Gallagher first heard him playing, though he was recommended to Noel by Paul Weller. Prior to joining Oasis, White drummed with London-based band Starclub and also for Dr Robert, lead vocalist of The Blow Monkeys.

===Oasis (1995–2004)===
White replaced original Oasis drummer Tony McCarroll in April 1995 and was immediately &quot;thrown in the deep end&quot;, joining the band the very next day to perform a playback of &quot;Some Might Say&quot; in front of a national TV audience on BBC1&#x27;s long running music programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. One of White&#x27;s first live shows with Oasis was in front of a massive crowd at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1995.

Until the arrival of Andy Bell in the autumn of 1999, White was the token southerner in the otherwise Mancunian Oasis. Initially known as &#x27;Whitey&#x27;, he was later re-christened &#x27;Dave&#x27; by the band because he once served himself a drink from an unattended bar, therefore resembling the character Dave from &quot;The Winchester&quot; in the &#x27;70s TV series &quot;Minder&quot;. White commented on the &quot;North/South divide&quot; saying it was not that bad, but &quot;for ages I was the &#x27;Cockney cunt&#x27; and they were the &#x27;Manc fuckers&#x27;&quot;. In his book, &quot;What&#x27;s the Story?&quot; Ian Robertson (who served as Oasis&#x27; tour manager from 1994 to 1995) stated that White was also known by the phrase &quot;Alan White – He&#x27;s alright&quot;.
White was also entrusted with the job of being Liam Gallagher&#x27;s &#x27;official&#x27; drinking partner and was also said to be his best friend in the band. Together, the pair were known as &#x27;Bert and Ernie&#x27;, named after the Sesame Street-characters. In December 2002, Liam and White were involved in a high-profile brawl in a German bar. Consequently, Liam allegedly lost some of his front teeth, and White needed a brain scan after suffering minor head injuries. Both were arrested by the authorities and were released only after the band&#x27;s management paid for their bail.

Noel Gallagher has stated that White had a far greater significance to the band than a mere session and touring drummer, claiming that he helped immensely in the recording process. Noel also said that when he wrote a song, he would play it to White who would often adapt the rhythm of the song or advise Gallagher on possible changes in the tempo. On the other hand, Oasis producer Owen Morris described White as &quot;essentially a jazz drummer&quot; who &quot;was always shuffling away on his snare [...] and never hitting the basic back beats in a big dumb rock and roll way&quot;, feeling that he did not understand Oasis&#x27; sound as well as McCarroll.

At the time of his departure White was the longest-serving member in Oasis beside the Gallaghers (he was later passed by Gem Archer and Andy Bell) and passed through thick and thin with the brothers despite being struck down several times with bouts of alleged tendinitis during his later years with the band. White performed on four of Oasis&#x27; studio albums: &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995), &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997), &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; (2000), and &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; (2002). He also played on the majority of band&#x27;s B-sides, some of which were released on the record &quot;The Masterplan&quot; (1998).

==Personal life==
White married an American actress and model Liz Carey on 13 August 1997 at Studley Priory Hotel, Oxfordshire. They had met on the set of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; music video in December 1995, as Carey was one of the models for the music video. They divorced in 2004.

White later had a son with a woman named Charlie, sold their London home in 2013, and moved with them to the country.

Steve, Alan&#x27;s older brother, played with Weller in The Style Council and various other famous musicians, including The Who. Because of this connection, Alan said, his brother greatly impacted his development as a drummer. Other influences include Keith Moon, Ringo Starr, Chad Smith, Mick Avory, and John Bonham.

<text>Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Limited(NIE Networks) is the electricity asset owner of the transmission and distribution infrastructure in Northern Ireland, established in 1993 when the business was privatised. NIE Networks does not generate or supply electricity. Since 2010 it has been a subsidiary of ESB Group.

NIE Networks has three transmission interconnectors with the transmission grid in the Republic of Ireland. The main interconnector was built in 1970 between Tandragee and Louth but The Troubles saw the interconnector destroyed in 1975 and left in that state for twenty years until repair.

NIE Networks should not be confused with Power NI, its own former supply business, which was not part of the sale to the ESB and remains owned by Energia. NIE Energy changed its name to Power NI on 25 July 2011, as ESB retained the NIE name in Northern Ireland.

==History==

=== Background ===
Electricity supplies in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, started in the early 1890s with the establishment of electricity undertakings by both Belfast Corporation and Londonderry Corporation. The co-ordination of supplies within the new Northern Ireland took place in 1931 with the foundation of the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland. The ownership of the all public power stations in Northern Ireland was vested in the Electricity Board in 1949.

==== Belfast Corporation ====
Belfast Corporation Electricity Department gained the authority to generate and sell electricity under the provisions of the &quot;Belfast Electric Lighting Order 1890&quot;, confirmed by the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 7) Act 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. cxcii). The corporation&#x27;s area of supply was 83 square miles with a population of 502,000 (1958). By 1958 there were three electricity generating stations at Belfast East, Belfast West and East Bridge.

Belfast East power station (formerly Harbour power station) comprised eight turbo-alternator generating sets: 1 × 6 MW British Thomson-Houston, 2 × 15 MW, 1 × 18.75 MW and 4 × 30 MW Metropolitan Vickers, a total electricity capacity of 174.75 MW. These were supplied with up to 2,010,000 pounds per hour (253 kg/s) of steam from 18 Babcock and Stirling coal-fired boilers.

Belfast West power station (formerly Victoria power station) comprised five turbo-alternator generating sets: 2 × 30 MW Parsons low pressure sets and 3 × 60 MW Parsons high pressure sets, giving a total capacity of 240 MW. The low pressure sets were supplied with up to a total of 540,000 pounds per hour (68 kg/s) of steam at 650 psi and 925 °F (44.8 bar and 496 °C) from four Clarke Chapman tri-drum coal-fired boilers. The high pressure sets were supplied with steam at 900 psi and 925 °F (62 bar and 496 °C) from three Babcock &amp; Wilcox radiant open pass type coal-fired boilers (each 220,000 lb/hr, 27.7 kg/s) and from six Mitchell two-drum coal-fired boilers (also each 220,000 lb/hr).

The East Bridge power station comprised two 6 MW turbo-alternators supplied with up to 120,000 lb/hr (15.1 kg/s) of steam from two Stirling coal-fired boilers.

From 1958 all the electricity generated was sold in bulk to the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee (NIJEC), supplies for distribution by Belfast Corporation were purchased from the NIJEC. In the year ending 31 March 1958 the Corporation exported 702,993 GWh to the NIJEC and purchased 541.750 GWh.

Consumers were supplied with a range of electric current: 220–380, 230–400 and 450–500 Volt AC and 220 and 440 Volt DC, and 550 V DC for traction. The growth in electricity supply is demonstrated in the table.
==== Londonderry Corporation ====
Londonderry Corporation Electricity Department gained the authority to generate and sell electricity in Derry under the provisions of the &quot;Londonderry Electric Lighting Order 1891&quot; confirmed by the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 3) Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. li). Further powers were given by the Londonderry Corporation Act 1918 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 5. c. xxi). Electricity supplies commenced in May 1894. The corporation&#x27;s supply area was 3.6 square miles with a population (in 1958) of 502,000. In 1958 the generating station comprised: two 1,000 kW Westinghouse, one 4,000 kW and two 6,000 kW Metropolitan Vickers turbo-alternators. There were also six rotary converters for the DC supply. The turbo-alternators were supplied with steam from two Babcock &amp; Wilcox and four Yarrow coal-fired boilers. Consumer supplies were 220–440 Volts DC and 220–380 Volts AC. The electricity supply from 1944 is shown in the table.
==== Electricity Board for Northern Ireland ====

The Electricity Board for Northern Ireland was established in 1931 under the provisions of the (21 &amp; 22 Geo. 5. c. 9 (N.I.)). Its duty was to co-ordinate and improve the supply, distribution and sale of electricity. The board&#x27;s area of supply was 5,200 square miles, with a population of 825,000 and 208,000 premises. Several electricity development schemes were scheduled in the 1931 act. For example, the first scheme included most of County Down and County Armagh and part of County Tyrone. The schemes culminated in an eighth scheme authorised in June 1947 to cover all remaining parts of Northern Ireland.
Under the (c. 18 (N.I.)) the Ministry of Commerce transferred to the board all the electricity property and assets held by the ministry including the power stations at Ballylumford and Larne. In 1957 the generating capacity of Ballylumford power station was 124.5 MW. There were 160,025 consumers, and 510.961 GWh of electricity were sold.

The station at Curran Point Larne was used for winter peak loads and maintenance outages. In 1957 it generated 48.9 MWh. The Board also owned a hydro-electric station at Limavady.

==== Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee ====
The Electricity (Supply) Act (Northern Ireland) 1948 (c. 18 (N.I.)) also established the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Committee (NIJEC). The committee had a duty to co-ordinate, control and improve the generation of electricity and primary transmission throughout Northern Ireland, to make adequate supplies available to electricity undertakings, and to encourage rural electrification. The Board and other undertakings were required to sell to the NIJEC the electricity generated at Ballylumford, Larne, Belfast and Londonderry power stations which the NIJEC bought at cost of production. The NIJEC resold electricity at a standard tariff to the distributing authorities.

Members of the committee were appointed by the Minister of Commerce. At its inception, the committee comprised Sir Eyre Gordon (chair), W.J. McC. Girvan (City general manager) and T.G. Christie (Northern Ireland Electricity Board). In 1959, the committee comprised C.A.R. Shillington (chair), R.P. Watson, and T.G. Christie.

The committee was abolished in 1967 upon the establishment of the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority.

==== Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority ====

The Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority was established in 1967 under the provisions of the (c. 11 (N.I.)). The authority had wider powers to supervise and control generation, transmission and the preparation of generating  plant programmes.

==== Northern Ireland Electricity Service (NIES) ====

On 1 April 1973, the Northern Ireland Electricity Service (NIES) was formed as a public utility to generate, transmit and supply electricity to Northern Ireland. It was established by the (SI 1972/1072).

During the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike in 1974, when electricity supplies were severely disrupted, the government considered generating power using a Royal Navy nuclear submarine in Belfast Lough but the idea was abandoned as being technically unfeasible.

=== Establishment and divestments ===
In 1991, the company was incorporated as a government-owned public limited company, Northern Ireland Electricity plc. In 1992 the power stations at Belfast Harbour, Ballylumford, Coolkeeragh and Kilroot were demerged and sold. In 1993 the remainder of NIE (transmission, supply and retail businesses) was privatised as Northern Ireland Electricity plc. In 1998, Northern Ireland Electricity plc became part of Viridian Group plc, with Northern Ireland Electricity a subsidiary of that holding company.

NIE Networks sold SONI, the operator of the transmission network, to EirGrid in March 2009 for £30 million.

=== Purchase by the ESB ===
On 7 July 2010, BBC News reported that the ESB was to purchase NIE for £1 billion. In September 2010, unionist politicians Peter Robinson and the then Sir Reg Empey wrote to the Taoiseach objecting to the transaction. They said it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; and that it amounted to the purchase of a &quot;key component&quot; of Northern Ireland&#x27;s infrastructure. The ESB is a statutory corporation within the Republic of Ireland, whose board members are appointed by the Irish government. The acquisition was completed in December 2010 at a reported cost of £1.2bn.

NIE Networks remains an autonomous organisation with its own board and management teams, and separate regulation via the Utility Regulator.

== Operations ==
===Overview===
The company&#x27;s operations consist of ownership of the electricity transmission and distribution networks in Northern Ireland, consisting of 30,000 miles (49,000 kilometers) of overhead lines and underground cables, 75,000 pole-mounted transformers and 340 major substations. As of 2023, NIE Networks transports power to over 910,000 business and domestic customers.

NIE Networks is also the electricity distribution network operator for Northern Ireland. It is not the electricity transmission system operator, as this role is fulfilled by the System Operator for Northern Ireland (SONI), a subsidiary of EirGrid since 2009.

=== Incident management ===
NIE Networks has developed a set of procedures for dealing with major incidents, such as storms and snow, driven by the Boxing Day Storm of 1998, during which 162,000 customers were off-supply.

<text>The Oregon City Bridge, also known as the Arch Bridge, is a steel through arch bridge spanning the Willamette River between Oregon City and West Linn, Oregon, United States. Completed in 1922, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built and is owned by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) as part of Oregon Route 43 and is the thirdsouthernmost Willamette bridge in the Portland metropolitan area, after the Boone Bridge in Wilsonville and the Oregon 219 bridge near Newberg.

The bridge is 745 ft (227 m) in length and 28 ft (8½ m) wide with a 360 ft (110 m) long main span that provides 49 ft (15 m) of vertical clearance at low river levels. The narrow width causes problems for large vehicles that cross it, often requiring traffic going in the other direction to stop. TriMet buses ceased using the bridge in 2009.

This bridge is the only Oregon bridge to be encased in gunite, which protects it from corrosive sulfur dioxide emissions from paper mills south of the bridge. The concrete look was favored by bridge designer Conde McCullough, designer of 500 Oregon bridges. His signature detailing is evident in the obelisk pylons with sconced light fixtures, ornate railings, and Art Deco piers.

The Oregon City Bridge is just downstream from the tall Willamette Falls and the Willamette Falls Locks, the oldest navigational locks in the United States. Downstream from this bridge is the George Abernethy Bridge, which carries Interstate 205.

==History==
The bridge was built to replace a pedestrian cablesuspension bridge completed in 1888. This existing bridge was utilized continuously during the construction process of the replacement, not only as access to the site for men and materialsassembling the box steel frames and pouring the reinforced concrete from its walkwaybut also as the main support system during the completion of the arch itself. Construction was made difficult by the engineering challenges posed by the great depth of the river at the site and worse from the need to manage and accommodate the frequent and ever increasing water traffic on its surface. The completed bridge was opened to the public on December 28, 1922, with the cost of construction reported as $300,000.

The piers were designed to accommodate public restrooms. The deck widens at the piers to provide room for the stairways – one on each side of the deck – that once descended to the restrooms. Repeated vandalism led to the closure of the restrooms in 1937, and the stairway entrances were covered over with concrete. Windows for &quot;observation balconies&quot; that were originally included in the piers, at the tops on both sides, were also sealed in concrete after closure.
The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as the Willamette River (Oregon City) Bridge (No. 357)) on July 1, 2005.

In March 2009, ODOT imposed new weight limits for vehicles crossing the bridge, after inspections revealed damage to some of the structure&#x27;s floor beams. Large commercial vehicles, or any vehicle weighing more than 14 tons, were banned from using the bridge. Among other impacts, the restriction meant the rerouting of all TriMet buses. The two routes using the bridge at that time, 35-Macadam and 154-Willamette, were rerouted across the Abernethy Bridge (I-205 bridge).

In 2010–2012, the Oregon City Bridge was given an extensive rehabilitation, overseen by ODOT. Work began in July 2010, and the bridge was temporarily closed to all traffic starting in January 2011. The bridge reopened on October 15, 2012, with the $15 million restoration project nearly completed. The final items of work were completed in early 2013. According to ODOT, one of the &quot;intentions&quot; of the project was to &quot;restore [the bridge&#x27;s] original load-carrying capacity&quot;, which would permit TriMet buses to resume using the bridge. However, as of September 2013 TriMet service had not returned to the bridge, and it is unknown whether the transit agency is planning to restore the former routings, or whether ODOT actually has restored the old (higher) load limits.

==Current use==
As of 2000, the bridge carried 12,800 vehicles per day, which represents only a 40% growth in traffic since 1953, when a public debate was held about building a parallel bridge next to the existing bridge. While the Oregon City Bridge did not get twinned, the George Abernethy Bridge (I-205 Bridge) opened in 1970 and has since become the major route through the area. TriMet buses crossed the bridge until March 2009, when a new weight limit temporarily banned buses and heavy commercial vehicles from using the bridge.

<text>The [[Royal Naval Reserve]] are a part of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom.

==Background==

===Impressment===
As the Royal Navy came to its more modern organisation during the 17th century it adopted the practice of impressment to provide the bulk of the crews.

The process of impressment was not suitable for the recruiting of officers, and the procedure adopted there was that officers received a basic pay for their rank when they were holding an appointment and half of that when between appointments (half-pay). Officers in command of ships or establishments received additional &#x27;Command money&#x27; which varied with the status of the ship or establishment involved.

===&#x27;Prize&#x27; scheme===
Officers and men also received extra payments under the &#x27;Prize&#x27; scheme. While this could arise in several different ways the most common by far was the capture of an enemy ship and its subsequent purchase by the Navy (a feasible process with wooden ships). For the ordinary sailor the amount was typically a few shillings (although this represented several months pay) but for the commanding officer it typically amounted to hundreds of pounds. Thus many captains had estates ashore which gave them an alternative income.

Junior officers were in a much more parlous state, as it was not really possible to keep a home on the half pay for a Lieutenant. This was part of the reason why marriage by junior officers was so frowned upon.

===Volunteering campaigns===
Impressment was eventually dropped in the early part of the 19th century in a move to encourage seamen to volunteer for full career employment in the naval service. This was fine for the numbers required during peacetime when many vessels were laid up in reserve but it meant that some means had to be provided to produce the extra men needed when the fleet expanded in time of war. An Act of Parliament of 1835 had established The Register of Seamen to identify men for naval service in the event of war, but in 1854 just 400 volunteered for duty out of 250,000 on the Register. The Register of Seamen was supplemented in 1853 with the creation of the Royal Naval Coast Volunteers (RNCV) comprising boatmen and fishermen who would undertake limited (geographic) service in the Navy during a conflict. This meant the Baltic fleet of Admiral Charles Napier was seriously undermanned for the blockade of Russia&#x27;s Baltic ports during the Crimean War, and as an MP Napier campaigned for improvements in the treatment of sailors. This led to a Royal Commission on Manning the Navy in 1858 which resulted in a new Act of Parliament in 1859. This authorised the raising of a new pool of volunteer seamen from the Merchant Service and fishing fleet who would undertake annual training in gunnery with the Navy and be called out for service in the fleet by royal proclamation in time of war. By 1862 there were 12,000 volunteers in the new force.

==Establishment==
The new force was named the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) and was originally for ratings but in 1861 this was extended to officers who wore distinctive rank lace consisting of interwoven chain links. Officers and men ranked in seniority with but behind their Royal Navy counterparts. A number of naval hulks were moored in the major seaports around Britain to facilitate gunnery training of seamen when they came in from foreign voyages. Officers spent longer periods of up to one or two years training in shore establishments and in ships of the fleet at home and abroad to acclimatise themselves with naval practice.

==Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve==
At the start of the 20th century with a period of rapid naval expansion taking place it was realised that the RNR could not supply the required number of trained men and a scheme was introduced that allowed men in civilian shore jobs (unconnected with the sea) to train on a part-time basis at special shore establishments, and provided the valuable experience of real time with the fleet for a few weeks a year once a certain level of competence had been achieved.

This was the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), known as the &#x27;Wavy Navy&#x27; on account of the rank stripes (rings) on officers sleeves being wavy rather than straight. The RNVR was organised in &#x27;Divisions&#x27; whose names were taken from the place where the main centre was situated. London, Edinburgh and most large seaports had such divisions. Each division was commanded by a Captain.

===The Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve===
In 1902, the Admiralty Lords decided to establish a Royal Naval Reserve unit at St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. HMS &quot;Calypso&quot;, a small older cruiser, was sent across the Atlantic to provide accommodation. 600 men, overwhelmingly local fishermen and seamen, were recruited. Many were seconded for training to the North Atlantic and West Indies Squadron. During the First World War the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve served with the regular navy and in 1916 the &quot;Calypso&quot; was renamed the H.M.S. &quot;Briton&quot;.

===Decline===
In the late 1930s, The Admiralty realised that the numbers available would not meet the needs of the fast approaching war and created the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve (RNVSR). The main recruits were amateur yachtsmen, who were given sufficient training to get them up to speed in a very high-pressure manner compared with the &#x27;ordinary&#x27; RNVR. The RNVSR uniform was the same as the RNVR one. The RNVSR was dropped after World War II.

Those who became officers during World War II were considered to have joined the RNVR and wore that service&#x27;s uniform. Most of the officers in landing craft, Coastal Forces and the Atlantic Convoys were RNVR and many regular officers were astonished how well they coped. A significant number achieved command of corvettes and even frigates. Quite a few also went into the submarine branch of the service and some achieved command there, the first being Commander E.P. Young DSO, DSC and bar, who commanded HMS &quot;Storm&quot;.

<text>Roy Linwood Clark (April 15, 1933 – November 15, 2018) was an American singer, musician, and television presenter. He is best known for having hosted &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in country music, both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.

During the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, banjo player, and fiddler. He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, Latin music, bluegrass, and pop. He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Young&quot; and &quot;Thank God and Greyhound&quot;), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of bluegrass and country musicians. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He published his autobiography, &quot;My Life—in Spite of Myself&quot;, in 1994.

==Early life==
Clark was born April 15, 1933, in Meherrin, Virginia, one of five children born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver). His father was a tobacco farmer. He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the Great Depression. When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the Washington Highlands neighborhood of Washington, D.C., after his father found work at the Washington Navy Yard.

Clark&#x27;s father was a semi-professional musician who played banjo, fiddle, and guitar, and his mother played piano. The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it, which he picked up in elementary school. His father taught Clark to play guitar when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and mandolin. &quot;Guitar was my real love, though,&quot; Clark later said. &quot;I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by George Barnes. I just loved his swing style and tone.&quot;

Clark also found inspiration in other local D.C. musicians. &quot;One of the things that influenced me growing up around Washington, D.C., in the &#x27;50s was that it had an awful lot of good musicians. And I used to go in and just steal them blind. I stole all their licks. It wasn&#x27;t until years later that I found out that a lot of them used to cringe and say &#x27;Oh, no! Here comes that kid again&#x27; when I&#x27;d come in. As for his banjo style, Clark said in 1985, &quot;When I started playing, you didn&#x27;t have many choices to follow, and Earl Scruggs was both of them.&quot; Clark won the National Banjo Championship in 1947 and 1948, and briefly toured with a band when he was 15.

Clark was very shy, and turned to humor as a way of easing his timidity. Country-western music was widely derided by Clark&#x27;s schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.

The D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time. Duet acts were in favor, and for his public performance debut Clark teamed up with Carl Lukat. Lukat was the lead guitarist, and Clark supported him on rhythm guitar. In 1949, at the age of 16, Clark made his television debut on WTTG, the DuMont Television Network affiliate in Washington, D.C. At 17, he made his first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry in recognition for winning his second national banjo title. By this time, he had begun to play fiddle and twelve-string guitar. He toured the country for the next 18 months playing backup guitar during the week for David &quot;Stringbean&quot; Akeman, Annie Lou and Danny, Lonzo and Oscar, and Hal and Velma Smith, working county fairs and small town theaters. On weekends, these acts usually teamed up with country music superstars like Red Foley or Ernest Tubb and played large venues in big cities. He earned $150 a week ($ in dollars). After the tour, Clark returned to performing at local country-music venues. He recorded singles for Coral Records and 4 Star Records.

At the age of 23, Clark obtained his pilot&#x27;s certificate and then bought a 1953 Piper Tri-Pacer (N1132C), which he flew for many years. This plane was raffled off on December 17, 2012, to benefit the charity Wings of Hope. He owned other planes, including a Mitsubishi MU-2, Stearman PT-17 and Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond 1A business jet.

==Career==
===Television===

Rising country music star Jimmy Dean asked Clark to join his band, the Texas Wildcats, in 1954. Clark was the lead guitarist, and made appearances on Dean&#x27;s &quot;Town and Country Time&quot; program on WARL-AM and on WMAL-TV (after the show moved to television from radio in 1955). Clark competed in 1956 on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, a variety show airing on CBS. It was his first network television appearance, and he came in second. Dean, who valued punctuality among musicians in his band, fired Clark for habitual tardiness in 1957. Clark left D.C. and never lived there again. During his D.C. years, Clark said he never intended to be a country guitarist. Rather, he played when he liked and what made him feel good, and never intended to begin a recording career or to perform on television. In the spring of 1959, Clark appeared regularly on George Hamilton IV&#x27;s short-lived television series in Washington, D.C.

In 1960, Clark went to Las Vegas, where he worked as a guitarist in a band led by former West Coast Western Swing bandleader-comedian Hank Penny. During the very early 1960s, he was also prominent in the backing band for Wanda Jackson—known as &quot;the Party Timers&quot;—during the latter part of her rockabilly period.

During Jack Paar&#x27;s temporary absence from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in early 1960, Jimmy Dean was asked to guest-host the program. Dean asked Clark to appear on the last night of his guest-host stint, and showcased Clark in two songs. Clark made his solo debut on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in January 1963.

Subsequently, Clark appeared on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as a recurring character — actually two, as he played businessman Roy Halsey and Roy&#x27;s mother, Myrtle. Once, in an episode of the Saturday evening &quot;Jackie Gleason Show&quot; dedicated to country music, Clark played a blistering rendition of &quot;Down Home&quot;. Later, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, where he played &quot;Malagueña&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, he was a co-host (along with Molly Bee and Rusty Draper) of a weekday daytime country variety series for NBC entitled &quot;Swingin&#x27; Country&quot;, which was canceled after two seasons. In 1969, Clark and Buck Owens debuted as hosts on the syndicated sketch comedy program &quot;Hee Haw&quot; which aired from 1969 until 1997 and propelled Clark to stardom. During its tenure, Clark was a member of the Million Dollar Band and participated in a host of comedy sketches. In 1976, Arthur Fiedler conducted Evening at Pops with Roy Clark and the Boston Pops Orchestra. In 1983, Clark opened the &quot;Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre&quot; in Branson, Missouri, which was the &quot;first venue linked permanently to a widely known entertainer&quot; in the resort town.

Clark frequently played in Branson during the 1980s and 1990s. He sold the venue in 1992(now owned by the Hughes Brothers and renamed the Hughes American Family Theatre) and went back to a light touring schedule. Clark annually appeared with Ramona Jones and the Jones Family Band at their annual tribute to Clark&#x27;s former &quot;Hee Haw&quot; co-star Grandpa Jones in Mountain View, Arkansas. On July 4, 1984, Roy played Washington D.C. along with several other acts to over 500,000 fans. Some of the other acts included Ringo Starr, the Beach Boys, Three Dog Night, George Jones, and B.J. Thomas.

===Music===

In 1960, Clark began touring with rockabilly star Wanda Jackson, and playing backup instrumentals on several of her recordings. Through Jackson, Clark met Jim Halsey. Clark signed with the Halsey Agency, which represented him for the remainder of his career. During this period, Jackson performed at the Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas. Within two years, Clark had become a headliner in Vegas, and made numerous appearances there in the 1960s and 1970s.

Clark&#x27;s backup work for Jackson brought him to the attention of Capitol Records. He signed with Capitol and in 1962 released his first solo album, &quot;The Lightning Fingers of Roy Clark&quot;. The album won solid critical praise, and &quot;above-average&quot; notice from fans. By the early 1970s, Clark was the highest-paid country music star in the United States, earning $7 million ($ in dollars) a year.

He switched to Dot Records and again scored hits. He later recorded for ABC Records, which had acquired Dot, and MCA Records, the latter of which then was allowed to absorb the ABC label.

==Endorsements==
Clark endorsed Mosrite, Gretsch, and Heritage guitars; the latter produced a signature model. In the 1980s, he served as a spokesman for Hunt&#x27;s ketchup.

==Personal life==
Clark married Ruby Conley in 1954. They had a son, Roy Linwood Clark Jr. The couple divorced in 1957. Roy married Barbara Joyce Rupard on August 31, 1957. They remained wed until Roy&#x27;s passing in 2018. The couple had five children. They made their home in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where the Roy Clark Elementary School was named in his honor in 1978.

Clark died on November 15, 2018, at age 85, at his Tulsa home from complications of pneumonia.

==Honors==
By the early 1970s, Clark had been named &quot;Entertainer of the Year&quot; three times by the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association (CMA). The Academy also named him &quot;Best Lead Guitar Player&quot; and &quot;Best Comedy Act&quot;, while the CMA named him an &quot;International Friendship Ambassador&quot; in 1976 after Clark toured the Soviet Union.

On August 22, 1987, Clark was made a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He played an annual benefit concert at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, the proceeds of which went to fund scholarships for aspiring musicians.

Clark was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2009. On April 12, 2011, Clark was honored by the Oklahoma House of Representatives. He was honored by the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame as Oklahoma&#x27;s Music Ambassador for Children and presented with a commendation from Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. In 2007, he was inducted into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Fiddlers Hall of Fame.
Roy Clark was one of the founding inductees into the Virginia Musical Museum &amp; Virginia Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Wayne Newton, Ella Fitzgerald, The Carter Family, The Statler Brothers, Bruce Hornsby, Pearl Bailey and Ralph Stanley were the other founding inductees.

<text>Pelle Hvenegaard (born 29 August 1975 in Copenhagen, Denmark) is a Danish actor and writer, best known for his role in the award-winning film &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; (1987).

Hvenegaard is named after the title character of Pelle from Danish author Martin Andersen Nexø&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;.

At age 11, director Bille August chose Hvenegaard to play the character he is named for, after the crew auditioned 3,000 children. August decided on Hvenegaard, who he said demonstrated concentration, patience and self-control.

Since 2008, Hvenegaard has been the host of &quot;Dagens Mand&quot;, the Danish version of &quot;Taken Out&quot;. In 2012, he was a host on the Danish morning talk show &quot;Go&#x27; Morgen Danmark&quot;.

<text>Andrew L. Stern (born November 22, 1950) is the former president of the Service Employees International Union, and now serves as its President Emeritus.

Stern has been a senior fellow at Georgetown University, Columbia University, and is now a Senior Fellow at the Economic Security Project.

He is the author of two books, &quot;A Country That Works&quot; (2006), and &quot;Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew Our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream&quot; (2016).

== Early life and career ==
Andy Stern grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, where his father was a lawyer and his mother worked both at home and in healthcare. Stern graduated from West Orange High School in 1968. He began college as a business major at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School of Business, but ultimately graduated in 1971 with a BA in education and urban planning. Stern began his career as a welfare caseworker and member of the SEIU Local 668 in 1973, eventually being elected president in 1977 of his Pennsylvania local. In 1980, he was elected to SEIU’s International Executive Board, as the youngest member in its history, and in 1984 the union&#x27;s then-president John Sweeney put him in charge of SEIU’s organizing efforts.

=== SEIU President ===
In 1996, Stern was elected to the presidency of the union in a hotly contested election. He led a major restructuring of the union to spending nearly 50% of its resources on organizing. In 1999 SEIU won the largest union election since 1935 for 74,000 LA home care workers. By 2000 SEIU had become the largest union in the AFL-CIO, and the fastest growing union in the world. It launched major North American campaigns “Justice for Janitors”, “Stand for Security”, “There’s No Place Like Home”, and set up offices around the world to lead transnational global accountability efforts for Sodexo, Securitas, and ISS. As a result of these efforts, SEIU grew 1,200,000 members under his leadership.

Stern was both a progressive and practical labor leader as Al Hunt profiled in his WSJ column, &quot;He (Stern) is a powerhouse in the labor movement and American politics, and one of a new breed of labor leaders determined to energize the movement.&quot; The Washington Business Journal profile was headlined &quot;Militant but pragmatic labor leader wants a vibrant D.C.&quot;

After launching a national debate aimed at uniting the nine out of ten American workers who have no organization at work, SEIU, along with the Teamsters, announced on July 25, 2005 that they were disaffiliating from the AFL-CIO. Stern led SEIU out of the AFL-CIO and founded Change to Win, a six-million-member federation of seven major unions &quot;dedicated to giving workers a voice at their jobs.&quot;

=== Political Influence ===
During the years of Stern&#x27;s leadership, the SEIU became the largest political action committee in the United States, and funneled vast amounts of financing to the Democratic Party and its candidates, far outnumbering the contributions of other unions during his last two election cycles. SEIU contributed $65 million to the 2004 presidential campaign of John Kerry. In 2008 SEIU sponsored with the Center for American Progress (CAP), the first Presidential election forum, on health care, and required all candidates seeking the union&#x27;s endorsement to “Walk A Day In My Shoes” including Senator Barack Obama as a home care worker Hillary Clinton as a nurse, and Joe Biden as a school maintenance worker, and have a plan for universal healthcare. The union spent another $85 million on Democratic candidates in 2008; $60 million going toward the election of President Barack Obama, with a significant chunk of that money funding door-to-door canvassing and other GOTV efforts, as well as voter registration.

Stern along with Harold Ickes, Ellen Malcolm, Steve Rosenthal, and George Soros, and other activists founded and funded America Coming Together (ACT) the largest independent expenditure in history at that time for grassroots organizing in an effort to defeat the re-election of President George Bush.

Stern has been the most frequent visitor to the White House since Obama&#x27;s election. Between Inauguration Day and February 23, 2011, Stern visited the White House 53 times.

And SEIU&#x27;s political organizing and advocacy changed the lives of workers in state after state. As Harold Meyerson wrote in the LA Times, &quot;Andy Stern has arguably been the most influential non-Californian in the affairs of California in the past 15 years...Stern has shaped the state’s politics and much of its economy.&quot;

=== Healthcare ===
Stern is referred to as one of &quot;the chief architects of healthcare reform&quot; in &quot;Modern Healthcare&quot; magazine, ranking in the top 10 of the 100 Most Powerful People in Healthcare. SEIU participated in over 12 coalitions with business leaders, labor and advocates, hosted the first Presidential primary in 2008 on healthcare, and after President Obama&#x27;s election created a war room with over 100 staff in the states advocating until the successful completion of the legislative process. Stern has been named to Modern Healthcare&#x27;s annual &quot;movers and shakers in healthcare&quot; list for five years in a row. SEIU poured millions into a group called Health Care for America NOW!, which, at times, fought strongly for universal healthcare including single payer. Stern was an ardent supporter of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

=== Media and Internet ===
Stern embraced political organizing via the Internet in the wake of the Howard Dean campaign, which his union endorsed.

Through Stern&#x27;s initiative, a New Media team was formed at SEIU in the late summer of 2008, the first major union to enter the digital age. The union&#x27;s website was completely redesigned and relaunched shortly thereafter.

In fall of 2005, he launched an online contest called Since Sliced Bread that awarded $100,000 for the best new economic ideas in America. Since 2005, Stern had been a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

Stern has been a key figure in financing the online grassroots &quot;netroots&quot; community, along with Dean, George Soros, Simon Rosenberg, and Andrew S. Rappaport, to funnel a progressive agenda to liberal bloggers.

Stern appeared on the covers of The New York Times Magazine, Fortune and Business Week, featured on CBS 60 Minutes, on Fox as the Power Player of the Week, CNN, and the Washington Post. He talks about his career and philosophy on the podcast The Great Battlefield.

=== Controversy ===
&quot;He&#x27;s arguably the most important labor leader we&#x27;ve had in a long time: aggressive and controversial,&quot; says Philip Dine, an authority on labor issues and author of the recent book &quot;State of the Unions.&quot; On January 27, 2009, SEIU placed UHW West under trusteeship and dismissed 70 of the local&#x27;s executives, including president Sal Rosselli. Rosselli and other ousted leaders reformed under the National Union of Healthcare Workers and pushed for UHW West members at 60 facilities to vote to decertify SEIU. SEIU filed a lawsuit in mid-2009 alleging that UHW West and NUHW officials embezzled millions of dollars. In 2009 Former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall issued a report, &quot;Acting as hearing officer, Mr. Marshall found that the local&#x27;s president, Sal Rosselli, and other union officials had improperly transferred union money to a nonprofit group to use in a feud with the parent union. Mr. Marshall also concluded that the local had wrongly hidden $500,000 from the parent union by placing the money into a lawyer&#x27;s trust account.&quot; On March 26, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court ruling that a jury awarded, &quot;... individual judgments ranged from $31,400 to $77,850, and NUHW was assessed damages of $724,000&quot;.

=== Resignation ===
Stern announced on April 13, 2010, that he would be stepping down as president of the SEIU. “There is a time to learn, a time to lead, and then there&#x27;s a time to leave. And shortly it will be my time to retire...and end my SEIU journey,” Stern wrote on April 14, 2010. Health care employers, often at odds with SEIU, begrudgingly wrote, &quot;Regardless of how you feel about Andy Stern, president of the 2.2 million-member Service Employees International Union, there is no denying that he is the most important labor leader of his generation.&quot; In response to question of why Stern has left at the height of his success Marick F. Masters, director of the Fraser Center for Workplace Issues and Labor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said... &quot;He had the presence of mind to leave when he is at the top rather than to stay longer,&quot;

=== Post SEIU Affiliations and Activities ===
SEIU honored Stern with the title of President Emeritus in 2010.

Stern was a senior fellow at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute from 2010 to 2011. From 2011 to 2016, he served as a Senior Fellow at the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business Law and Public Policy at Columbia University.

He is currently a Senior Fellow at the Economic Security Project. Stern has served on many non-profit Boards including the Open Society Foundations, the Hillman Foundation, and Broad Foundation, and works with many non-profits and unions on worker organizing.

== Written works ==
&quot;A Country That Works&quot; (Free Press), Stern calls for unions to be the dominant vehicles for the promotion of social reforms, including espousing the benefits of increased taxation on the wealthy and universal health care. On October 3, 2006, he appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to promote his new book &quot;A Country That Works&quot;. On October 4, he appeared on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; to promote the book.

In 2016, Stern authored a book with Lee Kravitz entitled &quot;Raising the Floor&quot;, discussed his exploration into the future of work and jobs leading to his leadership on providing cash, and a guaranteed income for all American. Stern&#x27;s book and conversations helped spark Andrew Yang’s candidacy for President promoting his platform of creating a universal basic income. With other organizers Stern assisted in the founding of the Economic Security Project, and serves on the board of the Income Movement. Stern was an early organizer for cash benefits and a guaranteed income which led to the passage of the Child Tax Credit as well as setting the stage for an increasing number of local experiments, as well as the American Recovery Act’s cash stimulus payments.

<text>(&quot;The Show with the Mouse&quot;), often (&quot;The Mouse&quot;), is a German children&#x27;s television series, popular nationwide and across all ages for its educational content. The show first aired on 7 March 1971. 

Originally called &quot;Lach- und Sachgeschichten für Fernsehanfänger&quot;, it was controversial because West German law prohibited television for children under six years of age. Today, the show is beloved and easily recognized among Germans for its theme, its mascots and the introduction as &quot;&quot;Lach- und Sachgeschichten&quot; (Funny and Documentary Stories).&quot;

The program was initially condemned by teachers and childcare professionals as bad for children&#x27;s development, but is now hailed for its ability to convey information to children, having received over 75 awards. On 7 March 1999 the program&#x27;s Internet site was launched and received 2,400 e-mails and 4 million hits on the first day.
==Format==
Aimed at young children, the program has a magazine format, with several segments, some humorous, others educational presented in a simple, straightforward manner. Many of the show&#x27;s early viewers are now adults whose children are forming the second generation of viewers. It is not uncommon for children to watch the program with their parents or for children to stop watching around the age of 10 or 12 and then come back at the age of 18. The German newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; found that although the target age was from about four to eight, the average age of viewers was 39.

Each show consists of several segments, the &quot;Lachgeschichten&quot; (&quot;laughing stories&quot;) purely to amuse, and the &quot;Sachgeschichten&quot; (&quot;non-fiction stories&quot; or &quot;documentaries&quot;), short educational features on a variety of topics, such as what must be done before a plane can take off, how holes get into Swiss cheese or stripes into toothpaste. These are punctuated by a short cartoon with the mouse, often with one or more of its friends.

===Introduction===
The show starts with its theme music, unchanged since 1971 and recognized throughout the German population. The introduction consists of a few bars of the theme and a German voice-over describing three topics in that week&#x27;s show, ending with introducing the mouse, the elephant and the duck. The intro would be repeated once in a foreign language. Initially, Turkish, Spanish and Italian were used, in order to include the children of foreign guest workers (Gastarbeiter). Today, another foreign language would be introduced every week. The foreign language is shortly revealed after the intro with ever the same phrase, like &quot;Das war... klingonisch!&quot;. That way, the &quot;Mouse&quot; introduced children to more than 100 different languages, not only the more commonly known languages like English, French or Spanish, but also strange languages like Aramaic, Afghan Dari, or fantasy languages like Klingon or &quot;elephantese&quot;.

===Animated interludes===
Between the show&#x27;s segments are &quot;mouse spots&quot;, hand-drawn cartoons of 30 to 100 seconds that feature the orange mouse and its friends, a small blue elephant and a yellow duck. None of the characters speak. Unique and identifying sound effects, as well as music comprise the soundtrack as the characters interact and solve problems, often in contradiction to laws of nature, but very much within laws of the animated world. The animated interludes serve to separate the segments, offering young viewers a moment to relax, avoiding sensory overload from too rapid a succession of input.

* The mouse is orange with brown ears, arms and legs. In order to solve problems it can stretch its legs as long as it wants, jump a rope with its detachable tail or fetch tools from its body. Following more the laws of animation rather than their real-world example, the protagonist mouse is the biggest one of the three characters.
* The elephant is blue with yellow toenails and is smaller than the mouse. It can be characterized as curious, very strong, spontaneous and faithful. When it appears on the stage it trumpets loudly. It likes to sleep, or to laugh when the mouse has done something wrong. It appears in many of the Mouse-Spots.
* The duck is yellow (with orange beak and feet), smaller than the mouse but larger than the elephant, so that their relative sizes are exactly the opposite of those of their real-life counterparts. The duck is naughty and quacks loudly, &quot;chaos comes onto the stage&quot; anytime it appears. It appears in the mouse-spots less frequently than the elephant.
===Educational film shorts===
The idea for the educational film shorts came from one of the founders of the series, who noticed that children were very aware of the advertising on television. They were very well-made with very good photography and he got the idea to make &quot;commercials&quot; about reality. The first production answered the question, &quot;Where do bread rolls come from?&quot; Some 400 letters a week arrive at the production office, and a large part of each show is used for such features, often answering questions asked by viewers. Segments have covered such topics as:
*How re-usable hand warmers work
*How the Internet works
*How a hot-air balloon flies
*How to make electricity from lemons, enough to light a light bulb
*How a cell phone works
*How solar cells work
*How weather and temperature relate to each other
A complete list of all documentary stories broadcast to this day is collected on the website of the show.
A stuffed toy &quot;Mouse&quot; flew into outer space and was a &quot;guest&quot; on board the Russian Mir space station, where it appeared in an educational segment. The stuffed toy was later brought back to the producers on earth. The mouse is often visually included as drawing, print or stuffed toy in documentary segments where a familiar focus point would serve an otherwise overwhelming experience.

A number of the educational segments have also dealt with difficult topics, such as life in Germany in the aftermath of World War II, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and death. Care is taken to explain things in a way that is comprehensible to young children. Analogies are used to explain concepts, and often everyday items already known to most children are used to illustrate. For example, a segment on the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest was produced using Playmobil figures to represent the three Roman legions involved, a total of 16,500 soldiers. Wanting to convey how large a force that was, the program purchased 16,500 Playmobil toy figures and dressed them up as Roman soldiers, lining them up into columns as they would have appeared in real life. The columns of toy soldiers took up 200 meters. These toy Roman legions are now housed in three museums in different parts of Germany.

A segment on the internet shows messengers running through the hallways of a large building, delivering messages in envelopes (data packets) from the user to servers and back. The hallways represent the data lines and the offices were internet hosts. In just eight minutes, the program accurately describes how the internet functions in a manner simple enough for children to understand. In the case of industrially produced things, each step is shown in great detail, so one can actually see how, for example, a piece of metal is formed by a tool. If something happens too fast for the naked eye it is shown filmed in slow motion. After each step, usually the previous steps including the new one are recapped briefly to help children remember what they already saw. Concepts which are not visible at all are explained with some form of analogous portrayal.

The segments would include originally recorded sound and voice-over narration as the only spoken language, further advancing the comprehensibility for children. People appear silent in these segments and would even engage in silent acting, while the voice-over narrates the film. When appearing in the show, working staff of institutions like the German Railway could often be convinced by the production to contribute to the show with silent acting.

Accordingly, the language used in the narration is kept very simple. The segments are usually narrated by an off-camera voice. Sentences are short. &quot;Big words&quot; are not used, and difficult concepts are broken down and described while they are being shown on camera. This is designed to free children from the more abstract concepts and devices of language, thus giving their minds space to comprehend the concepts explained rather than having to struggle comprehending the language of the explanation. Nonetheless, the educational film shorts are such effective presentations of their subject matter, a number of them are used as teaching tools at universities and colleges.

===Cartoon===
Every show also has at least one cartoon. Some are old classics, like the adventures of Zdeněk Miler&#x27;s Mole or newer cartoons, like Charlie and Lola or Trudes Tier (&quot;Trudy&#x27;s animal&quot;) .

===Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär===
As the last part of some shows, Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär (Captain Bluebear) tells his pink, green, and yellow grandchildren a cock-and-bull story, which his grandchildren always doubt to be true. His sailor side-kick, Hein Blöd (Hein Stupid), a rat, was created as a buffoon, a device that allows freedom for his character to express things other characters cannot. The characters of Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär, his grandchildren, and Hein Blöd were created by Walter Moers and made popular by Moers&#x27; book, &quot;The Lives of Captain Bluebear&quot; and Blaubär&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Die Sendung mit der Maus&quot;. Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär is voiced by veteran German actor Wolfgang Völz, with deep timbre and an accent of the Low German common in coastal area of Germany. The scenes on board Blaubär&#x27;s ship are made with Muppets-style puppets, while his stories are short animated films.

===Shaun das Schaf===
Käpt&#x27;n Blaubär is often replaced by the stop-action animation, &quot;Shaun the Sheep&quot; (&quot;Shaun das Schaf&quot;), and one episode of &quot;The Mouse&quot; featured a visit to Aardman Animations, showing how &quot;Shaun&quot; is produced. This educational film short, broken up into segments because of its complexity and length, showed the various stages of production and the amount of work required to create a single episode of &quot;Shaun&quot;. The episode of &quot;Shaun&quot; seen in production was then broadcast in its finished state at the end of that &quot;Mouse&quot;.

===Schnappi===
One episode featured a little crocodile named Schnappi (Snappy) singing about his life in Egypt on the Nile. The song went viral in Germany and became a hit in other countries as well.

==Awards==
&quot;Die Sendung mit der Maus&quot; and its creators continue to receive high praise from both television critics and pedagogic experts. The most notable of the roughly 75 awards won by the show and its creators are:

In Germany, the show is dubbed into French and in each country, subtitles appear in the local language. In French, the program is called &quot;La souris souriante&quot; (&quot;The smiling mouse&quot;). In Bolivia and in El Salvador, the show aired in Spanish as &quot;El cajón de los juguetes&quot; (&quot;The toys box&quot;).

The show was aired in Dutch called &quot;Het Programma met de Muis&quot;, which was aired on Nederland 1, as part of Nederlandse Omroep Stichting from 1973 until 1975.

== Spin-off ==
&quot;Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten&quot; (The show with the elephant) is a spin-off aimed at pre-school children, which started in 2007 and consists mainly of little stories, songs and games.

<text>Wishaw (; ; ) is a large town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, on the edge of the Clyde Valley, south-east of Glasgow city centre. 

The Burgh of Wishaw was formed in 1855 within Lanarkshire. It formed a joint large burgh with its neighbour Motherwell from 1920 until its dissolution when Scottish local authorities were restructured in 1975, and was then in Motherwell district within the Strathclyde region until 1996. The town is part of the Motherwell and Wishaw constituency. It has the postal code of ML2 and the dialling code 01698.

==Etymology==
It is not certain how Wishaw&#x27;s name came into being. The town is named after Wishaw House, a large manor built in the woods by the South Calder Water. The house was probably built some time after the sale of the lands of Coltness, Wishaw, Watstein and Stain to the predecessor of Lord Belhaven: Hamilton of Uddsten. It could be a corruption of &quot;Via shaw&quot; meaning &quot;way through the woods&quot;, which would make sense as an ancient Roman road was built through the modern town. Another theory is that the name derives from &quot;Wee Shaw&quot;, meaning small wood, or that the &quot;wis&quot; comes from the medieval Scots for &quot;water&quot;, meaning &quot;water wood&quot;.

In Scottish Gaelic, the main name of the town is Camas Neachdain.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The area of what is now Wishaw once lay on important Roman roads that ran through the areas of the Clyde (Latin – &quot;Cluta)&quot; and South Calder Water. In fact, the current Main Street is based on a road built by the Romans. Another such road ran close to Wishaw House.

In the 1960s, a pagan religious figurine was found in the woods near Netherton, showing that there was some form of settlement near Wishaw before the Christianisation of Scotland, which occurred between 400 and 600 AD.

=== Medieval era ===
A small church was established by a bend (&quot;camas/cambo-&quot; in Cumbric) on the banks of the Clyde near what is now Netherton in the eighth century. There is however dispute to whether this was named after (or established by) Neithon of Alt Clut or perhaps St Ninian. Nonetheless, the area became known as &quot;Cambusnethan&quot; or &quot;Kamnethan&quot; from then on. The site of the original church remains as a ruined burial ground, including an impressive mausoleum to Lord Belhaven. The churchyard is notably round, similar to those found in Wales and Ireland, suggesting it could have been built on an earlier Celtic temple. Excavated from this area was the Cambusnethan Stone, a large Christian tablet created by the Strathclyde Britons.

In the 12th century, a Norman lord constructed a large manor near Gowkthrapple, as well as another small church. This was the beginning of the parish of Cambusnethan, which lasted up until 1930. In the 13th century, administrative control of the parish was ceded to Glasgow from the previous Kelso Abbey. Small fortresses and tower houses were built, and after the Scottish Wars of Independence, the barony was transferred by Robert the Bruce to local lords, however the title lay abandoned by the 20th century. The Somervilles of Cambusnethan were the principal aristocrats in the area, although sold their land to Sir James Steuart,later Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1653. Wishaw House is thought to date back to the 15th century, and appears on Pont&#x27;s map of Scotland from 1583, as &quot;Wisha.&quot; The settlements of &quot;Greenhead&quot;, &quot;Camnethan&quot;, &quot;Peddyr&quot; and &quot;Overtoun of Camnethan&quot; also appear.

The ruined church on Kirk Road, mere yards away from the current Cambusnethan church, is thought to date back to the 1600s or earlier.

=== Modern era ===
In the 18th century agriculture in the area consisted mainly of growing oats although some wheat and pear trees were cultivated. Members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church took up the favourable terms of the proprietor to enable them to establish a congregation in Wishaw in 1792. The village itself was laid out in 1794, named Cambusnethan, and later renamed Wishawtown.

In 1801 the population of Wishaw was about 400 and that of the whole parish only 1,972. In the 1830s Lord Belhaven set up a distillery in Wishaw. Other nineteenth century industries included coal mining, iron and steel making, foundry work, railway-waggon building and fire-clay making. Wishaw grew dramatically in the 1830s, with railways and gasworks coming to the town, many collieries opening during this time period. By the time the Caledonian Railway&#x27;s main line came through Wishaw in 1848 it was a major mining centre fueling an important part of Scotland&#x27;s industrial heartland. There were also factories for needle-work and tambouring, and confectionery. On 4 September 1855, the town was incorporated with the villages of Coltness and Stewarton to form the Burgh of Wishaw, with a population of approximately 5,000. Four years later, in 1859, St.Ignatius Parish Church was established, and the church built on Young Street, where it remains to this day. In 1882 Groome recorded that there were 5 schools in Wishaw as well as others in nearby villages. Wishaw in the middle of the 19th century was visited by the Polish composer Frédéric Chopin. Chopin was entertained at Wishaw house and played there for the family, the Hamiltons of Belhaven.

Wishaw and its nearby neighbour of Motherwell were once the centre of steel manufacture in Scotland, as both towns were located either side of the former Ravenscraig steelworks which closed in 1992. The (now-defunct) local firm of &quot;R Y Pickering &amp; Co Ltd&quot; (later Norbrit-Pickering) built railway rolling stock (especially wagons) and many tramcars for tram systems throughout the UK. One of its last tramcar orders was for 10 double-decker trams for Aberdeen Corporation Tramways in 1949. In November 1996, the world&#x27;s worst recorded outbreak of &quot;E. coli O157&quot; occurred in the town, in which 21 people died and around 200 were infected.

=== Recent decades ===
The town has recovered from the loss of industry such as steelworks and coal mines which were shuttered in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Wishaw along with its neighbour Motherwell, voted 52% in favour of Scottish independence, meanwhile 48% voted against independence. Since 2015, Wishaw has voted SNP in both general elections and local Scottish elections, replacing Labour as the dominant party of the town. Wishaw also has a Scottish Conservative Councillor since 2017. 2024 labour was voted back in as the main constituency of Motherwell &amp; Wishaw after years of being SNP

These days, North Lanarkshire Council suggest that the majority of the biggest employers in the town are supermarkets, with the exceptions of Royal Mail, which has its main Scottish distribution centre at Shieldmuir and the NHS as a result of University Hospital Wishaw. There are many service industry businesses located in the town&#x27;s industrial areas, though none with more than a few hundred employees.

===Town centre===
Main Street is the predominant shopping area in Wishaw. It is partly made up of major national stores such as Peacock&#x27;s, Poundland, Iceland and Greggs.

The Main Street shopping area also features small independent retailers.
There are also many supermarkets in the area, with a new small format Asda in the eastern suburb of Newmains that opened in October 2007. A Tesco Extra superstore was also opened during November 2007, and is adjacent to the railway station, replacing the smaller Metro store on Main Street, about from the new store. Wishaw also has the &quot;Caledonian Centre&quot;, a shopping complex in the northern suburb of Craigneuk consisting of other national store chains such as Argos, Matalan, B &amp; M, Pets at Home and The Range.

The first stage of the modern town centre regeneration programme was completed in 2004, with a new car park being constructed between the local library and health centre and with the formation of a taxi rank adjacent to the library also a water fountain was put on the ground of Wishaw Library which looks like the old one which used to stand near the former Wishaw Health Centre. A piece of eyesore land between Station Road and Alexander Street (the railway station and sports centre) was converted into a park and ride facility, as part of this programme. This has led to a decrease in railway parking and traffic next to the station. The facility was later increased in size as it was too small.

In late 2011, Kitchener Street was converted from a small neighbourhood to a main road, routing traffic away from the Main Street to Kenilworth Avenue, where a new roundabout was built. Lammermore Terrace, which was previously one-way, was converted into a two-way street. In 2014 work on a new modern housing estate called Ravenwood began on the site of the old Lammermoor Primary school, which was renamed Calderbridge and moved to a new building 600m away. The neighbourhood was finished in 2016 and now consists of around 50 houses.

==Geography and climate==

===Locale===
Wishaw lies within North Lanarkshire, the fourth largest local authority in Scotland by population. The town is located in the relatively level Central Belt area; while there are valleys and high moors, there are no hills or summits over 1,640 feet.

The defined &quot;locality&quot; of Wishaw had a population of 30,290 in 2016, the 26th largest such place in the country. Along with its neighbours of Hamilton, Bellshill and Motherwell it had been considered to form part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, which as of 2019 had a population of around 1,670,000 (around a third of Scotland&#x27;s total); however, since 2016 Wishaw, Motherwell and Bellshill have been officially considered separate from the Glasgow &#x27;settlement&#x27; due to small gaps in the chain of occupied postcodes used to determine a grouping, and instead form their own settlement which itself has the fifth largest population in Scotland at 124,000.

===Climate===

Wishaw experiences mild summers and cool winters, with the most rainfall coming between October and March. Snow, while not unheard of during winters, is not the norm. Most winters in Wishaw see around 10–20 days of snow. The warmest month on average is July, with an average daily temperature of 14.7 °C, while the coldest is January with an average daily temperature of 2.3 °C.

Wishaw lies on two rivers, the Clyde running near Overton and Netherton and its tributary the South Calder Water, further north near Coltness and Newmains.

==Public services and religion==
===Education===

At present there are three high schools in the area: Clyde Valley High School in Overtown, and Coltness High School and St Aidan&#x27;s High School, both in Coltness. St. Aidan&#x27;s High School serves not only Catholic pupils from Wishaw, but nearby towns such as Newmains, Shotts and Carluke. St. Aidans, therefore has the highest number of pupils at around 1,100.

Primary schools in Wishaw include Calderbridge, St. Thomas&#x27;, Thornlie, St. Aidan&#x27;s, Cambusnethan, St. Ignatius&#x27; and Wishaw Academy (with both the latter two schools being a joint campus).

The town does not have a university or college at present, with the nearest college being Motherwell College, based in Ravenscraig, and the University of the West of Scotland (formerly Bell College of Technology) in Hamilton being the nearest university.

===Health===
Wishaw has a general hospital, now known as University Hospital Wishaw, in the Craigneuk area. It serves nearby settlements such as Motherwell, Newmains and Shotts. It is one of three acute hospitals in Lanarkshire, the others being Monklands Hospital in Airdrie and Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride.

Also based in the town, on the site of the old town library in Kenilworth Avenue, is the Houldsworth Centre which houses a café, public toilet, Wishaw library and Wishaw Health Centre. The centre opened in April 2015 along with a multi-storey car park.

===Religion===
Wishaw has many churches in it of various kinds and denominations. There are several Church of Scotland congregations. Serving principally the town centre are Wishaw Old Parish Church, the oldest building in Wishaw with the Town Clock in the steeple as the town&#x27;s principal landmark, and South Wishaw Parish Church, on the outskirts of the town centre. Serving the outlying parts of Wishaw are – Cambusnethan North Parish Church, Cambusnethan Old and Morningside Parish Church, Craigneuk and Belhaven Church, Coltness Memorial Church (Newmains) and St. Mark&#x27;s Church (Coltness). The Church of Scotland &quot;charges&quot; have been reduced in recent years through the union of Thornlie and Chalmers Churches to form South Wishaw Parish Church. The town also has a United Free Church, an Episcopal Church dedicated to St. Andrew, a Baptist church (both in Belhaven Terrace), a Gospel Hall (Ebenezer Gospel Hall), a Methodist church (now known as Netherton Methodist Church), a Christian Outreach Centre and five Roman Catholic Churches: St. Ignatius of Loyola (Young Street), St. Aidan&#x27;s (Coltness), St. Thomas&#x27; (Pather), St. Brigid&#x27;s (Newmains) and St. Patrick&#x27;s (Shieldmuir).

The town has a large Catholic population and strong Catholic links. These Catholics are mainly descended from the Irish Catholics who fled the Famine to settle in and around Glasgow, with many coming to Lanarkshire in particular. Today, the descendants of these immigrants constitute most of the Catholics in the town but there are also Catholics who are from other ethnicities, in particular those from the Italian and Polish communities in Scotland. Some Catholics are even ethnically Scottish.

==Governance and politics==
Wishaw is represented by several tiers of elected government. North Lanarkshire Council, the unitary local authority for Wishaw, is based at Motherwell, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The Motherwell and Wishaw constituency is represented in the UK Parliament by Pamela Nash MP (Labour). In the Scottish Parliament, the constituency is represented by Clare Adamson (SNP).

In addition to this, Wishaw is represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region.

==Sports and recreation==
===Facilities===
There is no professional football team in Wishaw. Many of the town&#x27;s residents are followers of Rangers, Celtic and near-neighbours Motherwell. There is however a junior football team, Wishaw, which plays its home games at Beltane Park, near to the town&#x27;s sports centre. There is also a large juvenile football club, Wishaw Wycombe Wanderers, who have many registered young players, playing football in age groups from Under 6s to Under 21s.

Wishaw has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V, next to the town&#x27;s hospital. This small park has two full-sized football pitches as well as a swing park and play area.

To the northwest of the town, there is a large golf course.

The town&#x27;s municipal sports centre also includes two small swimming pools, badminton and martial arts facilities and gymnastic equipment. A full-length running track is also on site along with a full-sized football pitch. Long jump pits and throwing cages are also issued within the track. There are also 5-a-side astroturf pitches for football, where many local games are held.
Elsewhere, all-weather pitches and a children&#x27;s play area behind Morrison&#x27;s have been closed for a new shared campus primary school by St. Ignatius Primary and Wishaw Academy Primary. The local council has made no announcement on whether these facilities will be replaced.

The town previously had a large swimming pool complete with a large spectator grandstand, an underwater viewpoint and diving facilities (with boards at 1.5m, 3m and 5m). This was closed during the late 1990s to make way for a much smaller facility on the site of the town&#x27;s sports centre. The reason given for this decision was the cost of maintaining such a facility for a town as small as Wishaw. Over the years it had played host to many regional swimming events and also benefited from being within walking distance of the two main secondary schools in the area as well as a host of primary schools.

University Hospital Wishaw also has a heat pool for specialist physio treatment.

===Town park===
Wishaw also has a town park named after Lord Belhaven, Belhaven Park. It has a swing park with plenty of climbing frames and slides, and plenty of benches. There is a pathway at the back of the park which leads through the trees and into a council estate. In March 2011, the parks play-area underwent a significant upgrade.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Wishaw railway station on the Argyle line (running from Lanark and Carstairs to Milngavie and Dalmuir).

A mainly half hourly Mon-Sat service &amp; hourly late evening and all day on Sundays is provided by ScotRail which connects Wishaw to places such as:

*Motherwell
*Carluke
*Cambuslang
*Bellshill
*Uddingston
*Glasgow Central
Wishaw also has a second station, Shieldmuir railway station, serving the Craigneuk area of the town. There is also a few services to Edinburgh Waverley which run Mon-Sat. Some extra peak services are provided Mon-Fri to/from Carstairs and Anderston via Glasgow Central Low Level.

Trains on the West Coast Main Line pass through the town at 115 mph, but no passenger service trains stop there, as the main Wishaw South railway station on the line closed in 1958.

===Roads===
Wishaw is on the A71, Edinburgh, Livingston and Kilmarnock road which links the town to the M74 as well as the A73 which links the town with the Borders regions and the M8.

Following a campaign by local politicians, the area is now well signposted from the nearby M8 and M74 motorways. This move was considered necessary as although the town is not considered a principal destination from either of these roads and therefore not included as standard on the signage, it is now the home to the main hospital for an area stretching right down the M74 corridor almost to the English border approximately 75 miles (120 km) away.

===Airport===
The nearest airport to Wishaw is Glasgow Airport at 20 miles (32 km) distant, though at 26 miles (42 km) Edinburgh Airport is not much further. Connections to both airports are only via the cities they serve as no direct public transport links are available.

==Wishawhill==
Wishawhill () is a small neighbourhood village in Wishaw. It is located to the north of the town. The suburb can be entered by Heathery Road or Cleland Road, with both roads leading onto the A721 or Glasgow Road running towards Wishaw Main Street.

Wishawhill is situated within walking distance from the major places in the town such as the Main Street, the large Tesco Extra superstore and Wishaw General Hospital. There is also the large golf course located to the north of the area. Virtually all of Wishawhill is low density residential housing and flats, with only a Community Center and the Wishaw Ex-Servicemen&#x27;s Club being the non-residential buildings in the area. Due to its close proximity with Wishaw Main Street, there is only one local newsagent shop. The suburb also has a swing park and a football pitch.

The area used to be host to one Roman Catholic Primary School, St Matthew&#x27;s, located on Pentland Road, until it was shut down in June 2010 due to councillors voting against their constituents wishes. This happened despite a large campaign by local residents to keep the school open. It is now being demolished due to repeated vandalism. Saint Thomas&#x27; in Pather is now the nearest Roman Catholic school to Wishawhill.

The Argyle Line next to Campsie Road passes through the suburb, with passenger services located at Wishaw railway station a mile away. Buses such as FirstGroup travel through the area, providing services to towns such as Motherwell. The rectangular road that run through the whole of Wishawhill (Campsie Road, Pentland Road, Grampian Road and Heathery Road) links to all the streets.

<text>Löwenzahn (&quot;Dandelion&quot;) is a children&#x27;s television series produced and aired by German public broadcaster ZDF on German television. Originally conceived and hosted by Peter Lustig, the first episode aired on 7 January 1979, then titled &quot;Pusteblume&quot;. The first episode of the retitled series &quot;Löwenzahn&quot; aired on 24 March 1981. After Lustig&#x27;s health-related retirement (he died in February 2016), the show was taken over by actor who plays the new host &quot;Fritz Fuchs&quot; in October 2006.

== Format ==
Each 30 minute episode is dedicated to a separate issue or theme and consists mainly of related short featurettes, which explain, explore and educate how things of everyday life and even complex systems work. It spans a wide variety of topics from technology and industry to something as mundane as how the postal service works.

Its central character (Peter Lustig as himself; later Guido Hammesfahr as &#x27;Fritz Fuchs&#x27;) is a handy and technophile middle-aged man with childlike curiosity, seeking an eco-friendly and self-sustaining lifestyle. Early in the series he moves from his city house to the outskirts of &quot;Bärstadt&quot; and into a blue caravan, which has become the shows landmark and a stable part of German popular culture. Peter manages to arrange his big lot of furniture from the house around the confined space of the caravan and finds some creative new ways to put them to use. The wardrobe is being transformed into an outside toilet room including a water flushing system and a glass cabinet is added to the cabin wall as a bay window. With a seating area that can be transformed into a bed by a pulley system and folding up furniture Peter manages to actually fit a sitting/dining area/bed, a small kitchen and a study area into the small camper. The bath tub however was placed outside. On top of the cabin he created a terrace which can be reached by stairs entirely made of chairs. The remodelling of his new home set the tone for the many DIY elements of upcoming episodes. However, Peter&#x27;s adventurous and inquisitive nature also tends to get him into trouble throughout the series.

The most common side character is Herr Paschulke (Helmut Krauss). He is shown as the complete opposite of Peter. He is lazy, eats mostly unhealthy food like pizza and burgers, doesn&#x27;t do any sports, has no interest in a more environmentally friendly lifestyle and often mocks Peter&#x27;s idea. Nonetheless they do get along greatly. Sometimes, Peter also manages to get Paschulke do things he doesn&#x27;t want to do like climbing on a mountain in the Bavarian Alps.

== Trivia ==
Lustig (the actor) also lived in the caravan for major parts of the filming.

Many of the episodes with Lustig contained a song sung by Lustig about the main subject of the episode.

The city used as &quot;Bärstadt&quot; (&quot;beartown&quot;) was actually Berlin (the animal in Berlin&#x27;s coat of arms is the bear) and people who know Berlin have recognized the locations used around the city.

The series has not only attracted children of all ages, it also found a wide adult audience, who have watched the series as children themselves and kept loyal to the format. 

== History ==
The series was originally called &quot;Pusteblume&quot; (coll. &quot;blowball/ dandelion clock&quot;) and was first broadcast on 7 January 1979. All episodes under the name of Pusteblume were shot in Munich and other parts of Bavaria, it is also where the character of Peter Lustig lived. The original production company, however, clashed with the public broadcasting station ZDF; the show was cancelled and restarted under a new name due to copyright issues. With &quot;Löwenzahn&quot; the title&#x27;s original reference to the beautiful, adaptable, strong and ever-changing Dandelion was retained. The show&#x27;s title sequence focuses on the flower&#x27;s strengths as well, while one of Lustig&#x27;s main messages to children was &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as weeds&quot;, inviting them to see nature&#x27;s vigorous beauty in all its lavish glory.

In the series itself the move was explained as that the airport entry lane for incoming airplanes was right above the house where Peter lived and in a bid to escape the constant noise he wanted to move, it was explained in the first episode of &quot;Löwenzahn&quot;. With the help of his cousin &quot;Trude&quot; he considers several means of housing until they pass by a building company and Peter finds interest in an old wooden building site cabin, which he gets. Trude offers him to use a lot of land she uses as allotment in the town she lives, &quot;Bärstadt&quot;, for placing the cabin.

Most episodes of Löwenzahn are shot in Berlin, where Peter&#x27;s building site wagon stands, but some episodes, depending on the subject of the episode, were also shot at different places, e.g. an airport-themed episode was shot at Hannover Airport, a ship-themed episode was mostly shot aboard the Finnjet, and a volcano-themed episode was even shot at Lanzarote.

In 2005 Peter Lustig retired from his role as the main host of the show due to health issues. He was replaced by Guido Hammesfahr, under whom the basic format of the show was kept: &quot;Fritz Fuchs&quot;, the character Hamesfahr plays, still lives in the old wagon, but a few new side characters were added. These include his dog Keks (&quot;Cookie&quot;), his female friend Yasemin (Sanam Afrashteh) and the strict code enforcement officer Heinz Kluthe (Holger Handtke).

Since 1981, Helmut Krauss had played the role of the fuddy-duddy and clumsy, but good-hearted neighbour &quot;Hermann Paschulke&quot;, a role that was kept after the takeover by Hammesfahr until Krauss died in August 2019.

<text>Prince Kūhiō Day is an official holiday in the state of Hawaii in the United States. It is celebrated annually on March 26, to mark the birth of Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole — heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii, prince of the House of Kalākaua, and later territorial delegate to the United States Congress. It was established in 1949 by the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii. 

As a delegate, Kuhio authored the first Hawaii Statehood bill in 1919. He also won passage of the Hawaiian Homes Act, creating the Hawaiian Homes Commission and setting aside of land for Hawaiian homesteaders. 

Prince Kūhiō Day is one of only two holidays in the United States dedicated to royalty, the other being Hawaii&#x27;s King Kamehameha Day on June 11.

<doc id="979938" wikidata="Q1314495" url="?curid=979938" title="RG Veda">
<text>is a manga created by Clamp, consisting of ten volumes in all. It was first published in Japan in 1989 as Clamp&#x27;s debut manga. The story features elements of Vedic mythology; the title itself is pronounced &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the name of one of the four Vedas. The series is known for its extravagant and richly detailed art. It inspired a 2-episode anime OVA that was released through 1991 to 1992. The OVAs were licensed by Central Park Media, while Manga Entertainment licensed it in the UK and Australia, with a different English dub.

The &quot;RG Veda&quot; manga has been translated and released in many different languages. Tokyopop has released English versions in the United States. However, they have since lost the rights, and Dark Horse Comics acquired the series, it being published in omnibus form in 2016.

==Plot==

Three hundred years ago, the god of thunder, Taishakuten, rebelled against the Heavenly Emperor, killing both him and the guardian god Ashura-ō. With the help of Ashura-ō&#x27;s wife Shashi, he usurped the throne and began his cruel reign as the new Emperor. However, a prophecy was made by the stargazer Kuyō, first to Ashura-ō and then to Yasha-ō:

Six stars will fall to this plane. The dark stars that will defy the Heavens. And you shall undertake a journey. One that begins when you find the child of a vanished race. I cannot discern the child&#x27;s alignment. I only know that it is he alone who can turn the wheels of Tenkai&#x27;s destiny. For it is by Heavenly Mandate that through this child, the Six Stars shall begin to gather. And then someone shall appear from the shadows. Even my powers cannot clearly make out his figure, but he knows the future and can manipulate both evil and heavenly stars. A roaring flame shall raze the wicked. Six stars will overpower all others. And inevitably, they will be the schism that splits the Heavens.

Following this prophecy, the Guardian Warrior of the northland, Yasha-ō, awakens the genderless child of Ashura-ō, Ashura, who has slept the last three hundred years under a magical seal. Believing the prophecy to mean that the &quot;Six Stars&quot; together can overthrow Taishakuten, he and Ashura set out to find the &quot;Six Stars&quot;. Over time, five of the Six Stars gather as Yasha-ō and Ashura, the first two stars, are joined by Sōma, Ryu-ō and Karura-ō, the other three. A mysterious character who appears and disappears quite regularly, Kujaku, gives them helpful advice, but his nature and intentions are unclear.

The gentle and childlike Ashura (who is usually referred to as &quot;he&quot; out of convenience, though some translations use a female pronoun) soon reveals a deadly alter-ego, a youth who delights in death and destruction, but this side remains for the longest time more or less suppressed, also by Ashura&#x27;s affection for Yasha-ō.

Seeking to bring Taishakuten&#x27;s reign to an end, the Six Stars finally enter Zenmi-jō, Taishakuten&#x27;s palace. They are met there by the three remaining &quot;Four Generals&quot; (&quot;Shitennō&quot;) (one was killed by Yasha-ō earlier), warriors who swore to protect Taishakuten. The Six Stars are shocked to discover that the sixth Star, Kendappa-ō, their friend and ally, is among them as Jikokuten, the previously unknown general. By the meeting of all the Six Stars, Ashura&#x27;s dark nature is brought to the surface. He kills his mother, the traitorous Shashi, takes the seal on her forehead and merges it with his sword Shura-tō, to awaken the true Ashura; the god of flame, blood and war, whose aim is to destroy heaven, earth, and hell.

The true Ashura proceeds to complete his awakening by killing the remaining Six Stars (some of them were killed earlier). He kills the stars one by one, absorbing their power, until only Yasha-ō is left. Surprisingly, Taishakuten stands against him. It turns out that his cruel reign was really a plot by him and the deceased Ashura-ō to prevent the gathering of the Six Stars and the true Ashura&#x27;s awakening. However, it is not Taishakuten who stops Ashura, but Ashura himself. As he is about to deal Yasha-ō the final blow, Ashura at the last moment stabs himself instead. He is then enveloped in a cocoon and enters into a deep sleep. Ashura is awakened hundreds of years later when Kujaku sacrifices his own life, on Yasha-ō&#x27;s promise that he will not let Ashura become the God of Destruction again.

==Production==
Clamp began work on &quot;RG Veda&quot; as a doujinshi comic, which attracted the attention of the publisher Shinshokan. Clamp decided to make a work based on eastern mythology rather than western myth as they were more familiar with the former. Part of this influence came from Clamp member Mokona, who grew up in Kyoto and became familiar with Hinduism and esoteric Buddhism due to her living close to temples and shrines as a child. When the series debuted, in order to secure a continued run Clamp had to surpass sales of the first tankobon volume. The first print run sold out, and as a result the group were given no other conditions to continue production.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Clamp, the &quot;RG Veda&quot; chapters were serialized in &quot;Wings&quot; from 1989 to 1996. Shinshokan collected the chapters in ten tankōbon volumes. The first was published on February 10, 1990; the final was released on May 15, 1996.

&quot;RG Veda&quot; is licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop. It released the first volume on April 12, 2005 and the final volume on September 11, 2007. The series was then re-released by Dark Horse Comics in a series of three collected editions, coming out between August 24, 2016 and August 15, 2018.

===Anime===
&quot;RG Veda&quot; was adapted into a two-part original video anime between 1991 and 1992, adapting part of the middle of the story. It was produced by Animate Film. It was released in the United States by Central Park Media and in the United Kingdom by Manga Entertainment. British anime critic Jonathan Clements has stated &quot;RG Veda&quot; was part of a series UK anime releases meant to follow the success of the film &quot;Akira&quot; but failed to live up to it, giving anime a bad reputation in the UK sci-fi circles.

==Reception==
===Manga===
In his review of Volume 1 of the TokyoPop release, Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network gave &quot;RG Veda&quot; a B grading. He commented that while the series was not their best work, &quot;CLAMP&#x27;s florid art style is already fully developed&quot;, and: &quot;Principal artist Mokona Apapa shows great confidence in her linework, rendering the characters with dramatic expressions and poses. These characters look awfully alike, though—&#x27;that dude with the dark, wavy hair&#x27; could be any one of three or four possible candidates. In fact, it might not even be a dude.&quot; A review on &quot;IGN&quot; of the first volume criticised the opening for being too heavy on exposition, but added that it got better after the first chapter and a half and that they wanted to continue reading after they completed the volume. They also praised the prophecy at the heart of the story for being &quot;one of the more interesting ones in that the future it foretells doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that much better than the present.&quot; Mason Templar, writing in &quot;&quot;, gave the series a rating of 1.5 stars out of 4, saying that while there was some &quot;beautiful composition&quot; and praising the ending, criticised the lack of action, the dialogue, and the art claiming: &quot;The artwork is dense and generic, looking more like You Higuri than later CLAMP manga.&quot; Modern critics have praised &quot;RG Veda&quot; for having early depictions of LGBT characters, with the series featuring several same-sex relationships as well as Ashura being genderless.

Reviewing the Dark Horse omnibus version, Jason Bradley Thompson of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; listed &quot;RG Veda&quot; as &quot;Recommended&quot;, saying: &quot;Fast-paced, full of action, and with beautiful artwork even though it&#x27;s CLAMP&#x27;s earliest work, it&#x27;s easy to see why this was a hit when it came out in 1989. ... Best of all, it moves quickly, avoiding the tendency to drag out the foreshadowing that afflicts many manga of this type (and even CLAMP&#x27;s own series &quot;X&quot;).&quot; Ian Wolf gave the series 10 out of 10 in &quot;MyM&quot;, praising the artwork, characters, backgrounds and clothing designs.

===Anime===
A review of the &quot;RG Veda&quot; anime OVA by &quot;The Anime Review&quot; describes the anime as, &quot;a dud&quot;, giving it a C− rating and writing that: &quot;Although the artwork is fantastic, for an action-adventure show, the pacing is horrendous.&quot; They also added: &quot;The only redeeming quality is that the OVA manages to get somewhere near the end, at least resolving the basic plot it had created while leaving itself wide open for sequels.&quot; Jeremy A Beard of THEM Anime Reviews gave the anime two out of five stars, describing the &quot;RG Veda&quot; OVA as: &quot;easily the worst CLAMP anime adaptation to date.&quot;

<doc id="979941" wikidata="Q77243" url="?curid=979941" title="Floris III, Count of Holland">
<text>Floris III (c. 1141 – August 1, 1190) was the count of Holland from 1157 to 1190. He was a son of Dirk VI and Sophia of Rheineck, heiress of Bentheim.

==Career==
Floris III was a loyal vassal to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He accompanied the emperor on two expeditions to Italy in 1158 and 1176–1178. Frederick thanked him by making Floris part of the imperial nobility. The emperor gave Floris the toll right of Geervliet, the most important toll station in Holland at that time. This was actually the legalisation of an existing situation, because the counts of Holland had charged tolls illegally since the start of the 11th century.

Many farmers came to Holland to turn the swamps into agricultural lands. Dikes and dams were built and the border between Holland and the bishopric of Utrecht had to be determined. There was a dispute between Floris and the bishop of Utrecht about a new dam in the Rhine at Zwammerdam in 1165, which had to be settled by emperor Frederick. The brother of Floris, Baldwin, became bishop of Utrecht in 1178.

War broke out between Flanders and Holland. Count Philip I of Flanders wanted to have Zeeland back. Floris was captured in Bruges and had to accept Flemish overlordship in Zeeland as ransom in 1167. During his reign Floris III had troubles with West Friesland and a war with Philip concerning their respective rights in West Zeeland, in which he was beaten. In 1170 a great flood caused immense devastation in the north and helped to form the Zuider Zee.

In 1189 Floris accompanied Frederick Barbarossa upon the Third Crusade, of which he was a distinguished leader. He died in 1190 at Antioch of pestilence and was buried there. He was succeeded by his son Dirk VII.

==Family and children==
In 1162, Floris married Ada, sister of King William the Lion of Scotland. The county of Holland adopted from him the rampant lion in the coat of arms and the name of William. Their children were:
# Ada (died after 1205), married 1176 Margrave Otto I of Brandenburg and later his son Otto II of Brandenburg
# Margaret (died after 1203), married 1182 Count Dietrich IV of Cleves
# Dirk VII of Holland
# William I of Holland
# Floris (died 1210), bishop of Glasgow
# Baldwin (died 1204)
# Robert
# Beatrix
# Elisabeth
# Hedwig
# Agnes (died 1228), abbess at Rijnsburg Abbey</text><links>

<doc id="979942" wikidata="Q576409" url="?curid=979942" title="Timeline of steam power">
<text>Steam power developed slowly over a period of several hundred years, progressing through expensive and fairly limited devices in the early 17th century, to useful pumps for mining in 1700, and then to Watt&#x27;s improved steam engine designs in the late 18th century. It is these later designs, introduced just when the need for practical power was growing due to the Industrial Revolution, that truly made steam power commonplace.

==Development phases==

===Early examples===
*1st century AD – Hero of Alexandria describes the Aeolipile, as an example of the power of heated air or water. The device consists of a rotating ball spun by steam jets; it produced little power and had no practical application, but is nevertheless the first known device moved by steam pressure. He also describes a way of transferring water from one vessel to another using pressure. The methods involved filling a bucket, the weight of which worked tackle to open temple doors, which were then closed again by a deadweight once the water in the bucket had been drawn out by a vacuum caused by cooling of the initial vessel.
* He claims it was built by Pope Sylvester II.
*Late 15th century AD: Leonardo Da Vinci described the Architonnerre, a steam-powered cannon.

<text>The Green Party of Hawai&#x27;i (GPH) () is the green party organization in the state of Hawaii, and an affiliate organization of the Green Party of the United States.

The party&#x27;s focus includes environmental issues, community-based economics, personal responsibility, diversity, social justice, and non-violence.

==History==

The Hawaii Green Party first qualified for the ballot in May 1992, one of the earliest state Green Parties to do so.

In November 1992, Keiko Bonk was elected to a seat on the Hawaii County (Big Island) County Council, the first Green to be elected in a partisan race in the United States. She was re-elected in 1994, but stepped down to run unsuccessfully for Island Mayor in 1996.

In November 1998, Julie Jacobson was elected to Bonk&#x27;s old seat on the Big Island, which she held upon re-election in 2000. Her campaign for election was managed by Bonk. When she decided not to run in 2002, her husband Bob Jacobson ran and was elected, then re-elected again in 2004 and 2006. Jacobson lost in 2008. No Green Party members have since held elected office in Hawaii.

In 2012, the Green Party of Hawaii was certified to be included on Hawaii partisan election ballots in all races through 2020. The party sued the Chief Election Officer Scott Nago as the state ran out of ballots on election day. A decision in the lawsuit was rendered by the Supreme Court of Hawaii on 19 July 2016.

<text>Wankan (王冠) (Japanese: &quot;King&#x27;s Crown&quot; or &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Crown&quot;) (also called Okan) is a kata practiced in many styles of Karate. Not much is known about the history of this kata. It originates from the Tomari-te school and in modern karate is practiced in Shorin-ryu, Shito-ryu, Shotokan, Genseiryu and Matsubayashi-ryu. 

It is often considered an advanced kata, despite its brevity. Karate master Shoshin Nagamine considered &quot;wankan&quot; to be his favorite kata. A quote from his book describes the kata as &quot;Being characterized by unitary sequences of attack and defense&quot;.

About Wankan, Nagamine Shōshin (1978: 240) said: This kata is said to be the creation of a master in ancient times, but the creator is unknown. Wankan belongs to the old kata. It was handed down by the warriors from the Tomari area and has been handed down to the present day. Its characteristics are many passages in which defense and offense are performed in one single action, that actions are formidable, and that it is a kata of medium length.

Wankan is also known as Matsukaze (松風 or &quot;pine tree wind&quot;) in some schools of karate.

<text>Yarnemia ascidiformis is a fossil tentatively classified as a tunicate. While &quot;Y. ascidiformis&quot; looks similar to tunicates, the oldest unequivocal tunicate, &quot;Shankouclava&quot; dates to the Cambrian period, while &quot;Y. ascidiformis&quot; is Ediacaran in age.

== Discovery and name ==
The holotype fossil of &quot;Yarnemia&quot; was found from the Ust-Pinega Formation between 1976 and 1978, and described in 1984.

The generic name &quot;Yarnemia&quot; comes from the village of Yarnema near which the first specimens were found. The specific epithet, &quot;ascidiformis&quot;, refers to the likeness to ascidians.

== Description ==

&quot;Yarnemia ascidiformis&quot; is a possible tunicate, growing up to in length, with the standard oblong body and two openings, or siphons, on the top of the body to allow water to flow through them.

==See also==
Other Ediacaran biota tentatively identified as tunicates include

<text>The Armstrong Whitworth Argosy was a British post-war transport/cargo aircraft; it was the final aircraft to be designed and produced by aviation company Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft. Although given different internal design numbers, the &quot;AW.650&quot; civil and &quot;AW.660&quot; military models were, for most practical purposes, the same design, while both models also shared the &quot;Argosy&quot; name.

Development of the Argosy originates in the &quot;AW.66&quot;, a proposed twin-engined military transport that was designed with British Air Ministry&#x27;s Operational Requirement 323 (OR323) in mind. While Armstrong Whitworth terminated work on the AW.66, it decided to go forward with a civilian-oriented derivative of the design, designated &quot;AW.65&quot;, as it was judged to be commercially viable. The AW.65 was redesigned to use four Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines, and thus was re-designated as the &quot;AW.650&quot;. On 8 January 1959, the first Argosy conducted the type&#x27;s maiden flight. In December 1960, the type received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification, enabling the initial civil version, referred to as the &quot;Series 100&quot;, to enter civil service across most parts of the world.

In Britain, military planners took interest in the Argosy and released a new specification for a militarised variant, designated &quot;AW.660&quot;. First flown on 4 March 1961, this model featured double the range of the &quot;Series 100&quot; and otherwise differed by an alternative door arrangement, which was largely to facilitate paratroop operations. Furthermore, an improved civil variant, the &quot;Series 200&quot;, was introduced at the behest of airline British European Airways (BEA). First flown on 11 March 1964, this model featured a new wing incorporating a fail safe structure, being stronger and lighter than its original counterpart. The Argosy was operated by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and various civil operators across the globe for numerous years. The type was withdrawn from RAF service during 1978, while the last Argosy was retired from civil operations during 1991.

==Development==
===Background===
The development of the Argosy can be traced back to the development of Operational Requirement 323 (OR323) by the British Air Ministry. During 1955, a specification was issued based upon OR323, which sought a medium-range freight aircraft that would be capable of lifting a maximum payload of 25,000 lb (11,340 kg), while also possessing a range of when carrying up to . British aviation manufacturer Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft took interest in this specification and decided to allocate members of its design team to the task of developing a suitable aircraft to meet its demands. Initially, design efforts were focused upon a twin-engine design intended for military use, which was internally designated as the &quot;AW.66&quot;.

As it was recognised that the aircraft held sales potential within the civil market, a civilian-oriented variant, designated &quot;AW.65&quot;, was also designed alongside the military design; the AW.65 principally differed from the AW.66 via the installation of full-section doors at each end of the fuselage to enable rapid loading and unloading operations. However, a lack of available finance contributed to the company&#x27;s decision to abandon all work towards meeting the military requirement; despite this setback, Armstrong Whitworth had already decided to proceed with developing the civil variant as a private venture. The company believed that the type would have significant appeal to the growing short-haul air freight sector of both the European and American markets. At that time, no other aircraft had been purpose-designed for such a purpose. As work continued, the AW.65 was extensively redesigned, including the adoption of four Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines; the resulting aircraft being designated as the &quot;AW.650&quot;.

On 8 January 1959, the first Argosy performed its maiden flight. It appeared during that year&#x27;s Farnborough Airshow, by which point five aircraft were flying, having cumulatively amassed about 400 flight hours between them. Certification-related testing of the type was reportedly completed during September 1960. In December 1960, the Argosy received type certification from the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), authorising the aircraft&#x27;s entry to commercial service. 10 of the initial civil version, the Series 100, were built; construction of these aircraft had commenced months prior to receiving certification so that deliveries could commence as soon as possible.

===Further development===
While the RAF had lost interest in any acquisition of the original AW.66 design, the service still needed to procure a replacement for its obsolete piston engined transport fleet, including the Vickers Valetta and Handley Page Hastings. During 1959, the British Air Ministry released a new specification that called for a military derivative of the AW.650, the envisioned aircraft was intended to serve in multiple roles, including as a medium-range transport, paratroop and supply aircraft. The resultant design, which was designated &quot;AW.660&quot;, was significantly different from the AW.650. Changes included the sealing of the nose door, its location being instead occupied by the radome of a weather radar unit, while the rear doors were substituted for by an alternative clamshell style which incorporated an integral loading ramp, while a stronger cargo floor was also installed. A pair of additional doors were fitted, one each on the starboard and port sides, which enabled paratroopers to exit. The military Argosy was powered by an arrangement of four Rolls-Royce Dart 101 turboprops and possessed twice the range of the civil Series 100. From July 1960, the second Argosy Series 100 was used to flight-test the new clamshell door design. On 4 March 1961, the first of the 56 Argosies destined for RAF service performed its first flight.

Early on, civil operator British European Airways (BEA) had shown open interest in the Argosy, the company viewed the aircraft as a potential replacement for its existing piston engined freighters; however, evaluations of the Series 100 soon found that its payload capacity would not allow for the type to operate profitably. Early on, as a measure taken to reduce design costs, the wing of the Argosy had been based on that of the Avro Shackleton, a maritime patrol aircraft that was developed and built by another entity within the Hawker Siddeley Group; in order to satisfy BEA&#x27;s requirements, a new wing was designed which shared the same aerodynamic design, but benefitted from a more modern &quot;Fail safe&quot; structure rather than the Safe-life design used on the earlier wing. This change resulted in a wing that was both stronger and lighter, but was also no longer limited in terms of its fatigue life. The revised version, designated as the &quot;Series 200&quot;, also featured several other improvements, including the adoption of enlarged cargo doors, integral wing fuel tanks and a modified landing gear arrangement. The Series 200 reportedly had better handling than the older Series 100, although some aerodynamic refinements were required during testing.

On 11 March 1964, the first Series 200 aircraft conducted its first flight; it was soon followed by six more Series 220s, which were outfitted with more powerful engines. While work had commenced upon another Series 220, this airframe was never completed and was ultimately scrapped. According to the aviation periodical &quot;Flight International::, the Argosy had been negatively impacted by the emergence of the long-haul passenger jet, as many surplus propeller-driven aircraft had been converted to freighters during this era, thus driving down both demand and prices for new-build cargo aircraft.

==Design==

The Armstrong Whitworth Argosy was a general-purpose transport aircraft largely used for freight operations by both military and civil operators. At the time of its introduction, the type was considered to be unique in its class. Principally designed as a freighter, the aircraft could also be used for other tasks. The Argosy was offered in a convertible configuration for carrying both freight and passengers; the civil variant could accommodate a maximum of 80 passengers while providing comfort and speed conditions comparable to the contemporary Vickers Viscount airliners. In the cargo role, the Argosy was designed for rapid turnaround times of only 20 minutes without the use of lifting trucks or cranes, utilising pallets and rollers to eliminate packaging.

In terms of its basic configuration, the Argosy&#x27;s tailplane was mounted on twin booms that ran rearwards from the inner engine nacelles, leaving the cargo doors at the rear of the fuselage clear for straight-in loading. Sideways-opening doors were fitted at both ends of the fuselage and the flight deck was set above the freight hold. This configuration allowed for an unobstructed cargo space measuring with a sill height corresponding to that of a normal flatbed truck. It had a maximum weight of 88,000 lb (39,915 kg) and a payload of 28,000 lb (12,700 kg). When cruising at 276 mph (444 km/h), it had a range of 1,780 mi (2,865 km) and could seat a maximum of 89 passengers.

The Argosy was powered by four Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines with Rotol-built four-blade propellers. The power rating of the engines depended on the aircraft variant. The sound produced by the Dart engines combined with its relatively unusual &quot;pod and boom&quot; basic configuration, which was similar to the earlier C-82 Packet and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport aircraft, has been attributed as the source of the type&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Whistling Wheelbarrow&quot;.

==Operational history==
===Civil use===
The Argosy Series 100 first entered service with the American cargo airline Riddle Airlines. Early on, Riddle had expressed interest in the type, having ambitions to use the type to meet contracts to provide logistics support to the United States Air Force (USAF) within the domestic United States. During late 1960, Riddle purchased a batch of seven Argosies for this purpose. However, when Riddle lost the logistics contract during 1962, its Argosies were repossessed by Armstrong Whitworth and subsequently sold onto other airlines, some of which had taken over the contracts previously being served by Riddle.

As a stopgap measure, BEA had ordered Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s three remaining Series 100s, intending to use them until the airline could receive its definitive Series 220s; during 1964, BEA had placed an order for five such aircraft. Reportedly, the Argosy had contributed to BEA possessing a superior air freighting ability to any other airline operating in the region, the type&#x27;s double-end loading capability being a viewed as a crucial part of its economics. During its operations of the type, the airline lost two Series 220s in separate crashes, choosing to purchase another Argosy to replace the first lost aircraft. Reportedly, BEA&#x27;s small fleet of Argosies was found to be unprofitable, even when BEA introduced the more-capable Series 220s; this has been attributed to BEA procedures relating both to safety and general operations. During April 1970, BEA opted to withdraw its Argosy fleet, choosing to replacing the type using a freighter conversion of its Vickers Vanguards.

Two aircraft were operated by SAFE Air in New Zealand, where they formed the main link between the Chatham Islands and the mainland; these aircraft were fitted with a pressurised &quot;passenger capsule&quot;. During April 1990s, one of these aircraft was damaged beyond repair as a result of a landing accident; a third Argosy was leased by SAFE Air from Australian company Mayne Nickless for five months during 1990 as a short-term replacement. During September 1990s, the final flight of a New Zealand Argosy was conducted by operator SAFE Air; the aircraft itself was retired and is presently being preserved by volunteer owners near Woodbourne Airport, Blenheim, New Zealand.

During 1991, the last operational Argosies, which was being flown by American cargo airline Duncan Aviation, were withdrawn, marking the end of the type&#x27;s flying history.

===Military use===

During the 1960s, the Argosy was procured for the Royal Air Force (RAF), the first of which entering service in March 1962. The service frequently made use of its capability to accommodate up to 69 troops, 48 stretcher cases or of freight. Operationally, it could carry various items of military equipment, including combat vehicles such as the Saracen or Ferret armoured cars, or artillery such as the 105 mm (4.13 in) howitzer or Wombat. However, subsequent design changes to both the Saracen and the Argosy&#x27;s mainspar (which ran throughout the top of its cargo bay) subsequently precluded the use of the Argosy as a Saracen transport.

During 1962, the earliest deployment of the Argosy was recorded as being performed to 105 Squadron, which was stationed in the Middle East, along with 114 and 267 Squadrons, based in the UK at RAF Benson. The following year, 215 Squadron received its Argosies, which were stationed at RAF Changi, Singapore. However, this squadron was disbanded on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1967, its aircraft being re-allocated to 70 Squadron, based at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. 70 Squadron would be the final squadron to operate the aircraft in the transport role, retiring its last Argosy during February 1975. During December 1970, the RAF had begun receiving American-built Lockheed Hercules transport planes, which progressively replaced the Argosy fleet in the transport role. Between 1968 and 1978, the E.1 variant of the Argosy, which was used in the calibration role, was flown by 115 Squadron, which was based at RAF Cottesmore for much of this time period.

==Variants==

===Armstrong Whitworth AW 650 Argosy (1959)===
A total of 17 were built for civil operators Riddle Airlines (Series 101) and British European Airways (series 102 and 222).

10 Series 101 and 102 aircraft were built. Seven Series 200 aircraft were built (the eighth was not completed); the series 200 had a larger freight hold and enlarged front and rear doors to enable it to carry standard size cargo pallets. The series 200 also had a lighter redesigned wing increasing the maximum range and Rolls-Royce Dart 532/1 turboprops.

===Armstrong Whitworth AW 660 Argosy ===
Additional differences to the civil variants:
* toilet and galley in the area of the deleted nose door 
* EKCO weather radar in the nose 
* Rover-APU in left tailboom
* up to 72 passenger seats, facing backwards 
* additional fuel tanks in centre wing
* strengthened landing gear.

56 aircraft were produced for the RAF under the designation Argosy C Mk 1 (C.1), it served in a total of six squadrons; three based in the UK and one each in Aden, Cyprus, and the Far East. The RAF withdrew the Argosy from transport missions during 1975 as an economic measure. Those aircraft not scrapped or retained were sold to commercial operators.

===Hawker Siddeley Argosy E Mk 1===
During 1963, Hawker Siddeley Group dropped the names of its component companies, rebranding its products under the Hawker Siddeley banner. To meet a requirement for a RAF flight inspection aircraft, nine Argosy C.1s were modified in 1971 as the Argosy E.1. These were a regular sight at British military airfields, being operated by 115 Squadron until they were replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Andover during 1978.

===Hawker Siddeley Argosy T Mk 2===
After the removal of the Argosy C.1 from the cargo/transport role, it was decided to modify 14 aircraft as Navigation Trainers for RAF Training Command, which were intended to replace the Vickers Varsity. One aircraft &quot;XP411&quot; was re-designated as the Argosy T Mk 1 in advance of delivery of the T Mk 2 fleet. Only two aircraft (&quot;XP447&quot; and XR136) were modified as the Argosy T.2, but they were not successful, the programme having been abandoned as a consequence of defence spending cuts.

<text>The Amsterdamse Poort is an old city gate of Haarlem, Netherlands. It is located at the end of the old route from Amsterdam to Haarlem and the only gate left from the original twelve city gates.

==History==
It was created in 1355 and is the only remaining city gate from the defenses of Haarlem. Until the 17th century it was the city gate used for traffic by land eastwards towards Spaarnwoude over the Laeghe weg (now Oude weg). In 1631 the Haarlemmertrekvaart was dug, which shortened the waterway from Haarlem to Amsterdam considerably.


This gate, for those travelling by land, was called the &quot;Spaarnwouderpoort&quot;. With the new canal and its towpath, the trip was so short, it became much more popular, since it was now possible to travel back and forth to Amsterdam on the same day. Thus the name of the gate changed to &quot;Amsterdamse Poort&quot;.

In 1865 the city government wanted to demolish the gate. A speedy procedure to put down the gate was requested, as the gate was in pretty bad shape and was blocking the construction of a new bridge on the location just in front of the gate. However, there was not enough money at the moment to construct a new bridge, so the city council agreed to provide funds for a short-term renovation of the gate to make sure it would stay up for two or three more years.

In 1867 the Papentoren, a tower, was demolished, and the munition that had been stored there needed a storage space. A room in the Amsterdamse Poort was suited for that and the munition was stored. In 1869 the bridge in front of the gate was finally reconstructed. In 1874 most of the (explosive) munition was taken outside the city.

In 1889 a small renovation was planned, with a budget of 1,490 guilders. The city architect, J. Leijh, started the project, which later required an extra 775 guilders.

In the 1960s the gate was declared a national monument. In 1985 a complete renovation of the gate took place.

<text>The Avro 707 (also known as Type 707) is an experimental aircraft designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Avro.

It was developed to test the tailless thick delta wing configuration chosen for the Avro 698 jet bomber, later named the Vulcan. In particular, the low-speed characteristics of such aircraft were not well known at the time. Aerodynamically, it was a one-third scale version of the Vulcan. The second prototype, &quot;VX790&quot;, was built to the &quot;707B&quot; configuration, featuring a longer nose, alternative cockpit canopy, a modified wing with (51°) sweep, and an elongated nose wheel leg for a greater angle of incidence during both landing and take offs. The twin-seat &quot;707C&quot;, the final variant, which had been designed to perform delta wing orientation training with the Royal Air Force; however, no production aircraft would ultimately be produced. The handful of 707s that were produced were largely used for flight testing purposes.

On 4 September 1949, the first Avro 707 performed its maiden flight; low-speed testing began shortly thereafter. Higher speed testing commenced in late 1953 using the third aircraft, the first &quot;707A&quot;. After development of the Vulcan had been completed, the four surviving 707s continued to be flown as general research aircraft. The prototype 707C was involved in various research programmes, the majority of which were unconnected to the Vulcan. Numerous tests involving the type were conducted by both the Royal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E) and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Australia. During the early 1950s, the Avro 707 performed several public appearances at the Farnborough Airshows. The last flying Avro 707 was grounded during 1967; three aircraft have been preserved and placed on static display in museums.

==Design and development==

The Avro 707 originated as a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; delta wing aircraft that was principally the work of Stuart D. Davies, Avro&#x27;s chief designer. It was a relatively compact aircraft that initially incorporated a wing with about 50° sweep, without a horizontal tail on a fin with trailing edge sweep. The trailing edge of this wing carried two pairs of control surfaces: inboard elevators and outboard ailerons. These flight surfaces worked in conjunction with a conventional rudder. Retractable airbrakes were also provided above and below the wings. The aircraft featured all-metal stressed-skin construction.

The prototypes were ordered by the Ministry of Supply to fulfil Specification E.15/48, which called for a low-speed research aircraft that would be a one-third scale version of Avro&#x27;s B.35/46 design for a strategic bomber. Production of this aircraft was accelerated by using several components from other aircraft, such as the canopy of the first prototype being taken from a Gloster Meteor. The Avro 707 programme provided valuable insights into the Vulcan&#x27;s flight characteristics, most of the information coming from the second and third prototypes which flew before the Vulcan. A half-scale aircraft, the &quot;Avro 710&quot;, was cancelled when it became clear that it would be less time-consuming to develop a high-speed variant of the Avro 707 instead.

All Avro 707s were powered by a single Rolls-Royce Derwent centrifugal turbojet engine. The air intake on the first prototype and later 707B was located on the upper rear fuselage. Some aircraft were outfitted with ejection seats. In total, five Avro 707s were completed.

==Operational history==

On 4 September 1949, the first Avro &quot;707&quot;, &quot;VX784&quot;, performed its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down, Squadron Leader Samuel Eric Esler, DFC, AE, was at the controls. Two days later, it was statically displayed at the Farnborough Airshow. However, testing with the first prototype was cut shortly when, on 30 September 1949, it crashed near Blackbushe during a test flight, killing Esler. The loss of the first prototype led to the construction of the second prototype being temporarily halted while the design was re-examined, leading to several refinements being implemented.

The next prototype, &quot;VX790&quot;, renamed the &quot;707B&quot;, had a longer nose, different cockpit canopy, a wing of different (51°) sweep and a longer nose wheel leg to provide the high angle of incidence required by deltas for landing and take off. The Avro 707B was given the same dorsal engine intake as the first prototype, although this was later modified to a NACA design. It first flew on 6 September 1950; the aircraft quickly proved to be relatively docile in flight. Both the 707 and 707B were largely flown to test low speed characteristics.

The third aircraft, designated &quot;707A&quot;, &quot;WD280&quot; was built for higher speed testing. Experience with the dorsal intake of the earlier 707 and 707B had shown that as speed increased, the cockpit induced turbulence which interrupted the intake airflow, thus the intakes were repositioned to the wing roots. It was not designed for supersonic flight as it was felt this would necessitate both power-operated flight controls and far greater engine power. When the Vulcan appeared, it looked very much like an enlarged 707A. Later, this 707A was used to test the compound leading edge sweep subsequently used on all Vulcans. Although the first Vulcan prototype was already flying, a second 707A &quot;WZ736&quot; was produced to speed the development programme. It made its maiden fight on 20 February 1953.

The final variant was the two-seat &quot;707C&quot;; originally four examples were ordered by the RAF with the intention of conducting orientation training for flying aircraft with delta wing configurations using the type. The 707C was provisioned with a wider cockpit to accommodate a &quot;side-by-side&quot; seating arrangement and dual flight controls. However, the production order was cancelled; accordingly, only the sole prototype, &quot;WZ744&quot;, was built. The 707C had its maiden flight on 1 July 1953 and was ultimately employed in other research that did not involve Vulcan development.

Even after the Vulcan development phase was over, the four surviving 707s, in individual bright blue, red, orange and silver (natural metal) colour schemes, continued in use as research aircraft. After the compound sweep investigation, and a period with the Royal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E) carrying out handling trials with powered controls, the first 707A went to the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Australia for low-speed delta wing airflow measurements. The second 707A was also at the R.A.E from June 1953 for aerodynamic and later, automatic control investigations.

During September 1952, the Avro 707B joined the R.A.E., becoming one of the aircraft used by the Empire Test Pilots School from January to September 1956, when it was damaged on landing, and broken up at R.A.E. Bedford. The two-seat 707C joined the R.A.E. in January 1956; perhaps its most substantial research contribution was to the development of fly-by-wire control systems, one of the first of their kind, and fitted with a side stick controller. This aircraft was flying with the R.A.E. until September 1966 when it achieved its full airframe time.

The Avro 707s made numerous public appearances at the Farnborough Airshow throughout the 1950s. During 1952, the first prototype Vulcan flew with the 707s A and B and in 1953, the four surviving Avro 707s flew alongside the first two Avro 698 Vulcan prototypes.

==Surviving aircraft==
No Avro 707s are presently airworthy. Both examples of the 707A variant survive. One, &quot;WZ736&quot;, was preserved in Great Britain at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, but has been transferred to the Boscombe Down Aviation Collection at Old Sarum, while the other, &quot;WD280&quot;, is preserved in Australia at the RAAF Museum at Point Cook, Victoria. Also in Great Britain is &quot;WZ744&quot;, the single 707C prototype, which was displayed at the RAF Museum, Cosford near Wolverhampton and is currently stored out of public view with its space in the museum&#x27;s Test Flight hall taken by the British Aerospace EAP.

<text>Jennings Randolph (March 8, 1902May 8, 1998) was an American politician from West Virginia. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service in the United States House of Representatives from 1933 to 1947 and the United States Senate from 1958 to 1985. He was the last living member of the United States Congress to have served during the first 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. Randolph retired in 1985, and was succeeded by Jay Rockefeller.

==Early life and career==
Randolph was born in Salem, West Virginia, the son of Idell (Bingham) and Ernest Fitz Randolph. He was named after William Jennings Bryan. Both his grandfather and father had been mayors of Salem.

He attended the public schools and graduated from the Salem Academy in 1920 and Salem College in 1922. In 1924 he engaged in newspaper work in Clarksburg, West Virginia. He was the associate editor of the West Virginia Review at Charleston, West Virginia in 1925; head of the department of public speaking and journalism at Davis and Elkins College at Elkins, West Virginia, 1926–1932; and a trustee of Salem College and Davis and Elkins College.

In 1930 Randolph lost a bid for election to the U.S. House of Representatives, but he won the seat in 1932 and was re-elected six times, serving from March 4, 1933, to January 3, 1947. While a congressman, he was chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the District of Columbia (Seventy-sixth through Seventy-ninth Congresses) and the U.S. House Committee on Civil Service (Seventy-ninth Congress).
Randolph was defeated for re-election in the Republican landslide of 1946. He had a longtime association with Southeastern University in Washington, D.C., serving as a professor of public speaking there from 1935–1953, and dean of the School of Business Administration from 1952 to 1958. In February 1947 he became assistant to the president and director of public relations at Capital Airlines (later purchased by United Airlines) in Washington, giving up those positions in April 1958 to focus on his campaign for the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senate==
Randolph was elected in a special election on November 4, 1958 to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Matthew M. Neely. He was elected to a full term in 1960, re-elected in 1966, 1972 and 1978, and served from November 5, 1958 to January 3, 1985. Randolph was chairman of the Committee on Public Works (89th through 95th Congresses) and its successor, the Committee on Environment and Public Works (95th and 96th Congresses). He was not a candidate for reelection in 1984.

==Legislation==
Randolph voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. On November 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed environmental bills H.R. 2817 and H.R. 4297, singling Randolph out as the sole senator he wanted to thank for their passage.

===Twenty-Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution===

Randolph was best known for sponsoring eleven times an amendment to the Constitution that would grant citizens aged between 18 and 21 the right to vote. He first introduced the amendment in 1942, arguing that young soldiers fighting in World War II should be able to vote. In 1970 amendments to the Voting Rights Act lowered the voting age to 18 in both local and national elections. After the Supreme Court found in &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; that Congress only had the power to lower the voting age to 18 for national elections, and no power to lower it for state elections, Randolph was among the senators who re-introduced the amendment. It was ratified by three-fourths of the states in 1971 as the Twenty-sixth Amendment, 107 days after it was approved by Congress.

Following a request from President Richard Nixon, on February 11, 1972 Jennings personally escorted Ella Mae Thompson Haddix to Randolph County Courthouse in Elkins, West Virginia to register to vote, becoming the first 18-year-old registered voter in the United States.

===Equal Rights Amendment===
On August 26, 1970, the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the right to vote, Randolph attracted widespread media coverage for negative comments he made concerning the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement. Feminists had organized a nationwide Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality that day, and presented the sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment. Randolph derided the protesters as &quot;braless bubbleheads&quot; and claimed that the equal rights activists did not speak for women, citing those more radical feminists that supported, as he put it, the &quot;right to unabridged abortions&quot;. Randolph would later admit that his &quot;bubbleheads&quot; comment was &quot;perhaps ill-chosen&quot; and went on to support the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1972, when the amendment passed the Senate, Randolph was a co-sponsor.

===Randolph-Sheppard Act===

While a member of the House of Representatives, Randolph was the main sponsor of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, which was passed by Congress in 1936. This act, which is still in force, gives blind people preference in federal contracts for food service stands on federal properties such as military bases, as well as some other jobs. Organizations for blind people such as the National Federation of the Blind cite this act as one of the first and most successful programs to give blind people secure jobs with less supervision and more independence than other previous programs such as sheltered workshops. This act became one of the first instances of affirmative action legislation.

===Aeronautics legislation===

An aviation enthusiast, he often flew more than once a day to visit constituents in West Virginia and to commute to Washington. He was the founder and first president of the Congressional Flying Club. He was a strong advocate for programs to advance air travel and airport development. In 1938 he sponsored the Civil Aeronautics Act, which transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Department of Commerce to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). The legislation gave the CAA the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve. In subsequent years, Randolph co-authored the Federal Airport Act as well as legislation that created the Civil Air Patrol, the National Air and Space Museum, and National Aviation Day. During his tenure in the Senate, he sponsored the Airport-Airways Development Act that created the Airport Trust Fund. As a co-author of the Appalachian Regional Development Act, he included provisions for the development of rural airports.

===Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act===

In 1942 Randolph proposed a Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act, which would fund the transformation of coal and its products into other useful forms of energy. To promote the viability of synthetic fuels, in November 1943 Randolph and a professional pilot flew in an aircraft powered by gasoline derived from coal. The small, single-engine airplane flew from Morgantown, West Virginia to National Airport in Washington, D.C. Aided by Interior Secretary Harold Ickes and Senator Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney, the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act was approved on April 5, 1944. The Act authorized $30 million for the construction and operation of demonstration plants to produce synthetic liquid fuels.

===Department of Peace===

He introduced legislation to establish a Department of Peace in 1946 with the goal of strengthening America&#x27;s capacity to resolve and manage international conflicts by both military and nonmilitary means. In the 1970s and 1980s he joined senators Mark Hatfield and Spark Matsunaga and Congressman Dan Glickman in efforts to create a national institution dedicated to peace. After he had announced his retirement from Congress in 1984, Randolph played a key role in the passage and enactment of the United States Institute of Peace Act. To guarantee its passage and funding, the legislation was attached to the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 1985. Approval of the legislation was in part a tribute to Randolph&#x27;s long career in public service. The Jennings Randolph Program, which awards fellowships to enable outstanding scholars, policymakers, journalists, and other professionals from around the world to conduct research at the U.S. Institute of Peace, has been named in his honor.

==Life outside Congress==
* Randolph&#x27;s early career is recounted in Napoleon Hill&#x27;s self-help book, &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;. Hill gave the commencement address at Randolph&#x27;s graduation from Salem College; Randolph was deeply moved and inspired by the address. Later, when Randolph was elected to Congress, he wrote to Hill, urging him to turn the speech into a printed book. The text of this letter appears in the book.
* Randolph married Mary Katherine Babb on February 18, 1933. She died of cancer on March 10, 1981, and the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center at West Virginia University is named for her.
* Randolph wrote a book along with James A. Bell called &quot;Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen... : A Practical Guide to Public Speaking,&quot; which was published in 1939.
* Randolph&#x27;s son, Jay Randolph, is a longtime television sportscaster for NBC, and KSDK for Cardinals games in St. Louis.
* His grandson, Jay Randolph Jr., was the lead anchor of the PGA Tour Network on XM Satellite Radio, and hosted a sports talk show on St. Louis radio station KFNS before passing in 2022.
* Jennings Randolph Lake, in Mineral County, West Virginia and Garrett County, Maryland, is named in his honor. The Jennings Randolph Bridge that carries U.S. Route 30 across the Ohio River between Chester, West Virginia, and East Liverpool, Ohio, also is named for him. In West Virginia, Interstate 79 is known as the &quot;Jennings Randolph Expressway&quot;.
* Randolph was de facto chairman of Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) accredited by the United Nations, and led U.S. delegations to seven AER annual conferences in Geneva, Switzerland (1981–1987).
* Randolph was the winner of the George S. Bartlett Award for road transportation in 1971.

==Death==

<text>Redbird trains were eight New York City Subway train models so-nicknamed because of their red paint. The Redbirds totaled 1,410 cars of the following types on the A Division lines: R26, R28, R29, R33, R33S, and R36. There were also 550 cars on the B Division lines: R27 and R30/A, making a grand total of 1,960 cars built. All were built by the American Car and Foundry Company and the St. Louis Car Company. 

These cars were painted a deep red to combat graffiti, which had become a major problem in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The color was referred to as &quot;Gunn Red&quot; or &quot;Broad Street Red&quot; in honor of its originator David L. Gunn, the former SEPTA General Manager who became President of the New York City Transit Authority during this period. Initially entering service in various colors, these cars received the new paint scheme between 1984 and 1989. Sixteen R17s were also given this paint scheme in 1985 and 1986, but were retired by 1988, well before the name &quot;Redbird&quot; caught on. Today, repurposed Redbird cars serve as garbage trains, rail adhesion cars, or rider cars on locomotive-hauled work trains, while others have been preserved by various museums.

==History==
These cars were built by two different manufacturers.
* American Car and Foundry built the R26 cars in 1959–1960 and the R28 in 1960–1961.
* St. Louis Car Company built the R27 cars in 1960–1961, the R29 in 1962, the R30/A in 1961–1962, the R33 in 1962–1963, R33S single cars in late 1963, and the R36 in 1963–1964.

The IRT cars provided main passenger service on the , , , , and trains, while the B Division cars provided passenger service on various BMT and IND lines. The IRT cars were occasionally used on Fan Trips on some B Division services as well.

===Retirements and replacements===
The BMT Redbirds were retired from 1989 to 1993, with the final R30 trip taking place on the C on June 25, 1993. Replaced by the R68 and R68A cars, most cars were scrapped at what is now Sims Metal Management&#x27;s Newark facility. Most IRT Redbirds were phased out from 2001 to 2003 and replaced by the new R142 and R142A cars. The final trip made by a train consisting of IRT Redbirds was made on November 3, 2003, on the . 1,292 Redbirds have been sunk at sea off the coasts of Delaware (Redbird Reef), Georgia, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Virginia as artificial reefs to promote marine life, to serve as a barrier, and to enhance recreational scuba diving by Weeks Marine Inc.

==Preservation==
Some Redbirds (R33s, R33Ss, and R36s) are used on the Train of Many Colors, including numerous historical subway cars in their original livery, all with contrasting colors. These cars are in the New York Transit Museum fleet. R28 pair 7926–7927 is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois, with trolley poles added for the ability to run on the museum&#x27;s mainline. R33S 9327 is at the Seashore Trolley Museum, also modified with trolley poles for operation at the site. Two R30s in its Redbird scheme: cars 8481 and 8522, survive in storage at 207th Street Yard.

==Other usage of Redbird name==
*The MBTA Red Line in Boston used the &quot;Redbird&quot; name starting in the late 1970s when that line&#x27;s rolling stock was repainted into a largely red scheme. However, that usage of &quot;Redbird&quot; followed a tradition set with those fleet&#x27;s prior paint schemes (&quot;Bluebirds&quot; for the 01400s, &quot;Silverbirds&quot; for the 01500s and 01600s).

<text>The British Aerospace EAP (standing for &quot;Experimental Aircraft Programme&quot;) is a British technology demonstrator aircraft developed by aviation company British Aerospace (BAe) as a private venture. It was designed to research technologies to be used for a future European combat aircraft, and for the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon.

The EAP has its roots within the earlier &quot;Agile Combat Aircraft&quot; (ACA), a collaborative initiative studying advanced technologies to produce more capable fighter aircraft. Upon the announcement of the EAP during October 1983, it was intended to be a multinational European effort; however, neither West Germany nor Italy would ultimately contribute financially, thus the programme relied upon a combination of British public and British and European private funding instead. Having been manufactured in sections across multiple facilities, the sole EAP aircraft (serial &quot;ZF534&quot;) was rolled out during April 1986. Performing its maiden flight on 8 August 1986, the EAP would fly over 250 sorties prior to its grounding on 1 May 1991, by which point the aircraft had fulfilled its intended purpose as a development aid.

The British House of Commons Accounts Committee credited the EAP with reducing the development of the Eurofighter by a year for a saving of £850 million.

During the second half of 1991, the Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering department of Loughborough University received the EAP aircraft, where it was used as a static instructional aid in the teaching of Aeronautical Engineering students for many years. In early 2012, in response to a request from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the EAP was transported to the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford; it has since been reassembled and put on public display in the museum&#x27;s collection.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the EAP can be found within the &quot;Agile Combat Aircraft&quot; (ACA) programme performed by British Aerospace (BAe) during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is known that ACA had involved the combining of several years of private venture research conducted by BAe, costed at around £25 million, together with similar contemporary studies that had been performed by West German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) (such as the &quot;TKF-90&quot; project) and Italian aviation company Aeritalia. Seeking to develop a new generation of fighter aircraft to equip the various air forces of Western Europe, the three companies had recognised the benefits of cooperation and the sharing of critical technologies to achieve this goal. Technologies which became central to the ACA included full-authority digital fly-by-wire controls, which would enable a significantly aerodynamically unstable aircraft to be flown, and multiple advanced manufacturing processes.

During the early 1980s, it was recognised that, due to the high extent of cutting-edge technologies involved, a reasonable risk reduction measure ahead of launching a full-scale production programme would be the completion of several technology demonstrator aircraft. During the 1982 Farnborough Airshow, a mockup of the ACA was publicly exhibited; this mockup also appeared at the Paris Air Show in May 1983. It was at the 1983 Paris Air Show that the official launch of the &quot;Experimental Aircraft Programme&quot; (EAP), under which a pair of technology demonstrators would be manufactured and flown, was announced. At the programme&#x27;s launch, it was intended for the EAP to be a partnership between Britain and several of its European neighbours, including West Germany and Italy.

The initial project definition of what became the Eurofighter Typhoon commenced shortly after the EAP project was initiated. While the similarity between the EAP and the Eurofighter Typhoon is striking, there are numerous important design differences; the cranked delta wings of the EAP have been replaced with a straight delta, while the size of the fin has been much reduced and the rectangular air intake of the prototype has been replaced with one with a &quot;smiling&quot; configuration.

===Funding and construction===
The EAP was intended to be financed by multiple countries. Early on, the British Government announced that it would make a financial contribution to the EAP; however, funding would not prove to be forthcoming from the West German government, which heavily contributed to the decision to cancel the planned second airframe prior to major work commencing. The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) reportedly invested almost £80m into the EAP. The initiative became exclusively funded by the UK, from both the public and the private sector, the latter in the form of the aviation industry itself. Following German government instructions to withdraw support, MBB withdrew but other German companies stayed in.

Assembly of the sole EAP aircraft was performed within British Aerospace&#x27;s development facility (No. 2 Hangar) at Warton. Structurally, it comprised three major fuselage structures; front, centre &amp; rear. The front fuselage contained many innovative structures in Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composites and aluminium-lithium alloy, while the centre and rear fuselage structures were conventional - a result of MBB withdrawal, the right hand wing assembly, manufactured at BAe&#x27;s Samlesbury plant, was a co-bonded carbon fibre composite assembly, proving new tooling and manufacturing techniques which were put to good use later on the Eurofighter programme. The left hand wing assembly was manufactured at the Corso Marche facility of Aeritalia in Turin. The foreplanes were manufactured in carbon composite at Preston/Samlesbury; detail design and manufacture of the windscreen and canopy assemblies was done by Aerostructures Hamble, in Southampton.

The EAP was designed to research technologies to be used for a future European combat aircraft. Accordingly, the EAP was fitted with a variety of advanced electronic equipment, including three cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays and a Head-up display (HUD) similar to the American General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The flight controls were Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS)-compatible and incorporated a departure prevention system. Power was provided by a pair of Turbo-Union RB199-104 afterburning turbofans, previously used as the Panavia Tornado ADV&#x27;s powerplant. To reduce costs, the rear fuselage and tailfin of a Tornado was used as the basis of the unit that was eventually fitted to the EAP prototype. Due to its experimental nature, no operational armaments or military systems were ever installed; several dummy munitions were routinely fitted in low-drag positions however. The radome was used for flight test instrumentation. 

===Flight testing===

On 18 April 1986, the sole EAP aircraft (serial &quot;ZF534&quot;) was officially rolled out at BAe&#x27;s Warton facility, being unveiled by BAe Chief Executive Sir Raymond Lygo. On 8 August 1986, after multiple delays due to unfavourable weather conditions, the EAP conducted its maiden flight, flown by BAe’s Executive Director of Flight Operations David Eagles. During this initial flight, it reportedly attained a maximum speed of Mach 1.1, exceeding the speed of sound, as well as altitudes of up to 30,000ft. Nine further flights were performed within a week of the maiden flight. The EAP was shown publicly for the first time at Farnborough in September.

During its initial months of flight, the EAP was principally involved in early proving flights. In addition to testing the aircraft itself, test frequently involved using the EAP in its capacity as a flying testbed for investigating and validating around 36 individual technological developments. During one test flight in September 1986, all cockpit displays went down due to computer failure, leading to the aircraft returning safely to Warton using backup instrumentation; the cause was quickly identified and resolved. During May 1987, the main phase of the test flight programme commenced, by which point the EAP had been equipped with an anti-spin parachute and the control laws also upgraded to &quot;Paris Standard&quot;, featuring angle-of-attack and side-slip feedback.

Following the initial flights of the type, in addition to continuing flight testing, an increasing emphasis was placed on the performance of pre-arranged aerial displays at various airshows; in such a capacity, the EAP would demonstrate its capabilities, such as its high level of agility, to a wide audience, often consisting of both the general public and figures interested in the prospective production programme. The EAP&#x27;s one hundredth flight was performed during the 1987 Paris Air Show. During December 1987, the third phase of test flying commenced, after which an increasing emphasis was placed upon testing various technologies for the future Eurofighter Typhoon, such as the direct voice input interface and multi-function displays. The flight control laws would also be progressively refined, improving the handling and enabling the EAP to reach a recorded maximum speed of Mach 2.0 during its latter years of operation; the aircraft also demonstrated an ability to maintain controlled flight while flown at very high angles of attack, reportedly in excess of 35 degrees. The final round of test flights involved exploring the functionality of the in-flight flutter and structural coupling mode.

By the end of its flying career, the EAP had reportedly flown 259 sorties and accumulated a total of 195 flight hours. According to aviation historian Nick Sturgess, the EAP&#x27;s flight testing had contributed heavily to the development of computerised flight control systems, new construction techniques, and the exploration of advanced aerodynamics. Chris Boardman, a managing director at BAe&#x27;s successor company, BAE Systems, commented in 2013 that the EAP was fundamentally important to defining and developing both the characteristics and capabilities of the subsequent Eurofighter Typhoon.

==Preservation==
On 1 May 1991, the sole EAP aircraft was retired from the flight test programme; it was subsequently transported to the display area of the Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering department of Loughborough University. For the next two decades it was used as an instructional aid for teaching Aeronautical Engineering students the components and systems of a modern fighter jet. For this purpose, its port wing had been removed at the root, providing a better view of both the aerofoil cross-section and several internal components. Furthermore, other components had been removed from the aircraft and could be separately examined.

On 26 March 2012, the EAP departed the Aeronautical &amp; Automotive Engineering Department at Loughborough University following the RAF&#x27;s request to have the aircraft displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford instead. During November 2013, following limited restoration work, the reconstituted EAP was placed on public display as part of the museum’s Test Flight collection.

<text>Chinte (珍手) (Japanese: &quot;Rare Hand&quot; or &quot;Unusual Hand&quot;) is a kata practiced in Shotokan, Shito-ryu and in Okinawan Shorin-ryu Kyudokan. It is a very old kata originating from China. Its mixture of standard movements and rarely seen techniques, vestiges of ancient forms, give this kata a special appeal. Particularly dynamic, with its alternating strong and slow passages, Chinte is unique also in the presence of a number of circular techniques, despite the preference in Shotokan karate for linear movements. It is a kata of close-distance self-defense techniques. The somewhat peculiar closing movements allude to the absorption of the power of the waves by the sand, which is a symbol of the return to tranquility after the violent storm. 

Some believe the final three movements of the Shotokan version, a series of backwards hops, were added to bring the kata back to the original starting place in order to facilitate competition, because they are not present in the other versions of the kata practiced by other styles of Japanese Karate. Alternatively, it could be that the final movements were dropped by other styles because their meaning was lost. One interpretation of the final movements is that an opponent&#x27;s grab to one&#x27;s chest is secured and then the hops are used to apply one&#x27;s body weight to break his wrist. In Seiyo Shorin-Ryu Karate, the last three hops are replaced by taitoshi (body leg drop) followed with a series of blocks, a kick and punch.

<text>A secondary color is a color made by mixing two primary colors of a given color model in even proportions. Combining two secondary colors in the same manner produces a tertiary color. Secondary colors are special in traditional color theory, but have no special meaning in color science.

==Overview==
===Primary color===

In traditional color theory, it is believed that all colors can be mixed from 3 universal primary - or pure - colors, which were originally believed to be red, yellow and blue pigments (representing the RYB color model). However, modern color science does not recognize universal primary colors and only defines primary colors for a given color model or color space. RGB and CMYK color models are popular color models in modern color science, but are only chosen as efficient primaries, in that their combination leads to a large gamut. However, any three primaries can produce a viable color gamut. The RYB model continues to be used and taught as a color model for practical color mixing in the visual arts.

===Secondary color===
A secondary color is an even mixture of two primary colors. For a given color model, secondary colors have no special meaning, but are useful when comparing additive and subtractive color models.

===Intermediate color===
An intermediate color is any mixture of a secondary and a primary color. They are often visualized as &quot;even&quot; mixtures, but intermediate colors can arise from any mixture proportion. Therefore any color that is not a secondary or primary color is an intermediate color.

===Tertiary color===
Tertiary color has two common, conflicting definitions, depending on context.

In traditional color theory, which applies mostly to practical painting, a tertiary color is an &quot;even&quot; mixture between two secondary colors, i.e. a mixture of three primaries in 1:2:1 proportion. This definition is used by color theorists, such as Moses Harris and Josef Albers. The result is approximately a less saturated form of the dominant primary color of the mixture. Under this definition, a color model has 3 tertiary colors.

More recently, an alternative definition has emerged that is more applicable to digital media, where a tertiary color is an intermediate color resulting from an &quot;even&quot; mixture of a primary and a secondary color, i.e. a mixture of the primaries in 3:1:0 proportion. The result yields a maximum saturation for a given hue. Under this definition, a color model has 6 tertiary colors.

===Quaternary color===
A quaternary color is a seldom-used descriptor that is the conceptual extension of a tertiary color. Quaternary colors have no special use or status in color theory or color science.

Under the traditional definition, a quaternary color is the even mixture of two tertiary colors, as demonstrated by Charles Hayter. These quaternary colors have contributions from all three primaries in 3-3-2 proportions, so are very desaturated (even mixtures of three primaries gives a neutral color: zero saturation). Under this definition, a color model has 3 quaternary colors.

Under the modern definition, a quaternary color is the even mixture of a tertiary color with either a secondary or primary color. Quaternary colors are sometimes given a maximum saturation for their hue. Under this definition, a color model has 12 quaternary colors.

==RGB and CMYK==
The RGB color model is an additive mixing model, used to estimate the mixing of colored light, with primary colors red, green, and blue. The secondary colors are yellow, cyan and magenta as demonstrated here: 

The CMY color model is an analogous subtractive mixing color model, used to estimate the mixing of colored pigments, with primary colors cyan, magenta, and yellow, equivalent to the secondary colors of the RGB color model. The secondary colors of the CMY model are blue, red and green, equivalent to the primary colors of the RGB model, as demonstrated here:

Under the modern definition, the 6 tertiary colors are conceptually equivalent between the color models, and can be described by the even combinations of a primary and a secondary color:

A color model is a conceptual model and does not have specifically defined primary colors. A color space based on the RGB color model, most commonly sRGB, has defined primaries and can be used to visualize the color mixing and yield approximate tertiary colors. Also note that the color terms applied to tertiary and quaternary colors are not well-defined.
&#x27;

==RYB color model==
RYB is a subtractive mixing color model, used to estimate the mixing of pigments (e.g. paint) in traditional color theory, with primary colors red, yellow, and blue. The secondary colors are green, purple, and orange as demonstrated here:

Under the modern definition (as even combinations of a primary and a secondary color), tertiary colors are typically named by combining the names of the adjacent primary and secondary color. However, these tertiary colors have also been ascribed with common names: amber/marigold (yellow-orange), vermilion/cinnabar (red-orange), magenta (red-purple), violet (blue-purple), teal/aqua (blue-green), and chartreuse/lime green (yellow-green). The 6 tertiary colors are given:

Approximate colors and color names are given for the tertiary and quaternary colors. However, the names for the twelve quaternary colors are quite variable, and defined here only as an approximation.

Under the traditional definition, there are three tertiary colors, approximately named russet (orange–purple), slate (purple–green), and citron (green–orange), with the corresponding three quaternary colors plum (russet–slate), sage (slate–citron), buff (citron–russet) (with olive sometimes used for either slate or citron). In every level of mixing, saturation of the resultant decreases and mixing two quaternary colors approaches gray.

The RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the 1835 book &quot;Chromatography&quot;, an analysis of the RYB color wheel by George Field, a chemist who specialized in pigments and dyes.

<text>Teylers Museum () is an art, natural history, and science museum in Haarlem, Netherlands. Established in 1778, Teylers Museum was founded as a centre for contemporary art and science. The historic centre of the museum is the neoclassical Oval Room (1784), which was built behind the house of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778), the so-called &quot;Fundatiehuis&quot; (Foundation House). Pieter Teyler was a wealthy cloth merchant and banker of Scottish descent, who bequeathed his fortune for the advancement of religion, art, and science. He was a Mennonite and follower of the Scottish Enlightenment.

==History==
In his will, Pieter Teyler stipulated that his collection and part of his fortune should be used to establish a foundation for their promotion: Teylers Stichting. The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem was split into two societies: Teylers First or Theological Society (Dutch: &quot;Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap&quot;), intended for the study of religion and Teylers Second Society (Dutch: &quot;Teylers Tweede Genootschap&quot;), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing, and numismatics.

The executors of Teyler&#x27;s will, the first directors of Teylers Stichting, decided to establish a centre for study and education. Under a single roof, it would house all manner of suitable artifacts, such as books, scientific instruments, drawings, fossils, and minerals. The concept was based on a revolutionary ideal derived from the Enlightenment: that people could discover the world independently, without coercion by church or state. The example that guided the founders in establishing Teylers Museum was the &quot;Mouseion&quot; of classical antiquity: a &quot;temple for the muses of the arts and sciences&quot; that could also serve as a meeting place for scholars and the venue for various collections.

==Oval Room==


In 1779, Leendert Viervant started on the design of an &quot;art and book room&quot; behind Teyler&#x27;s residence. This neoclassical room, whose shape quickly led it to be called the Oval Room, was designed for research and study; here, scientific experiments would be conducted, public demonstrations held, and books, drawings, and prints viewed by the public. The Oval room was opened in 1784, with the scientist Martin van Marum as its first director.

A showcase in the centre displays a mineralogical collection from the 18th century and the showcases around hold 18th-century scientific instruments. The upper gallery, which was designed to let in the maximum amount of light for viewing purposes, has 12 built-in bookcases, largely containing period encyclopaedias and periodicals.

==Extensions==
Over the ensuing centuries, the museum was gradually extended. The arrangement of each new part was consistent with the insights of the day; thereafter it remained almost wholly unchanged. In the 19th century, the museum was expanded with a gallery for fossils (&#x27;Gaanderij der Versteeningen&#x27;, in 1888 changed to the Numismatic Cabinet) and two painting galleries: Teylers First Painting Gallery in 1838 and Paintings Gallery II in 1892. In 1878, to mark the first centenary, a new entrance on the Spaarne (the current main entrance) was designed by the Viennese architect Christian Ulrich. It opened in 1885. The rooms behind it – the Instrument Room, and Fossil Room I and, behind it, Fossil Room II – were designed by the Haarlem architect A. van der Steur. At the same time, the library was extended and a 150-seat auditorium was added. Over a century later, in 1996, a large new wing was added; this was the design of Hubert-Jan Henket. In 2002, an adjoining property was added to the museum to serve as the museum shop and multimedia room.

==Collection==
Teylers Museum holdings include fossils (some are the first ever discovered of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;), minerals, scientific instruments, medals, coins, and paintings.

The museum&#x27;s first director, Martinus van Marum contributed to and used the facilities at Teylers Museum to research static electricity. To study fossils, he purchased fossil material such as the &quot;Mosasaurus&quot;. To demonstrate the principles of hydraulics, he commissioned models of mills and cranes.
To disseminate natural and cultural knowledge, public experiments were conducted, such as those with van Marum&#x27;s large electrostatic generator built in 1784 by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam (the largest in the world). Lectures were given and scientific literature published.

The collection of Teylers Museum holdings include works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Guercino, and Claude Lorrain. The museum contains graphic work of Rembrandt and Adriaen van Ostade. 

The Painting Galleries show a collection of works from the Dutch Romantic School and the later Hague and Amsterdam Schools, including major works by Barend Cornelis Koekkoek, Andreas Schelfhout, Cornelis Springer, Hendrik Willem Mesdag, Jan Willem Pieneman, Anton Mauve, Jacob Maris, Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, George Hendrik Breitner, Jozef Israëls, and Isaac Israëls.

In 2007, the works of John James Audubon were displayed.

The original mission of the second society included research, as well as education. After the death of van Marum, Teylers continued to attract scientists of high standing as caretakers. The theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner Hendrik Lorentz was appointed Curator of Teylers Physics Cabinet in 1910, a position he held until his death in 1928. At the time of his appointment, Lorentz was at the height of his scientific career and was a central figure in the international community of physicists. Under his leadership, the Teylers Museum conducted scientific research in such diverse fields as optics, electromagnetism, radio waves, and atom physics. Lorentz was succeeded by the physicist and musician Adriaan Fokker. Physicist Wander Johannes de Haas served as conservator in the 1920s.

The museum&#x27;s entire archives have also survived intact. They include the complete series of accounts for all acquisitions, extensions, salaries and day-to-day purchases since 1778, the complete series of visitors&#x27; books since 1789, and the minutes of all meetings of the museum board since 1778.

The museum is open six days a week; Tuesdays-Sundays 10:00-17:00.

== Heritage site ==
The museum is on the top 100 Dutch heritage sites list compiled by the Department for Conservation in 1990. It was nominated on 12 December 2011 by the Dutch Cabinet for UNESCO World Heritage Site status, based on its long history as a public knowledge institute and its continued efforts to preserve public access to its collections. However, the nomination was withdrawn in 2013.

== Administration ==
Since 1 January 2022, Marc de Beyer is the museum director. The former director is Marjan Scharloo. Terry van Druten is curator of the art collections of the museum, Trienke van der Spek is curator of the scientific collections, including fossils, minerals and the library. 

The museum had 137,000 visitors in 2019.

Teylers Museum is a member of the Museumvereniging (Museum Association).

<text>The Handley Page HP.88 was a British research aircraft, built in the early 1950s for Handley Page to test the aerodynamics of the Victor crescent wing design, and was intended to be a scaled-down version of that aircraft.

==Development==
The single HP.88 aircraft was designed to Air Ministry Specification E.6/48, issued on 12 March 1948, for an aerodynamic testbed for the proposed Handley Page Victor V-bomber, and in particular the crescent wing to be used by Handley Page&#x27;s jet bomber.

To save time and cost it was decided to base the fuselage on the Supermarine Attacker. This was then changed to the Supermarine Swift which had already been redesigned with a swept wing. In the event, the many changes led Supermarine to give the design its own designation as the Supermarine 521. Detail design was contracted to General Aircraft (GAL) at Hanworth Aerodrome, but after GAL merged with Blackburn the work was moved to Brough Aerodrome and the design was given the Blackburn/SBAC designation YB-2. The aircraft was allocated military serial &quot;VX330&quot;.

The HP.88 had a 0.36 scaled-down equivalent of the Victor&#x27;s crescent wing and T-tail with slab tailplane. However where the Victor had a mid wing, the Type 521 set the wing low on the fuselage. Also, the Victor design continued to be refined, so the HP.88 was no longer representative of the Victor. The HP.88 wing featured inboard trailing-edge flaps, which badly affected trim when deployed. The tailplane was too small to counter the trim change, so a system was developed where the ailerons deflected upwards together to balance the trim forces. The system was wholly automatic with no pilot intervention, and in the event of any failure all surfaces would return to their normal positions. Uprigging the ailerons was a technique used during flutter testing on the second prototype Victor. The fin flutter speed was critically dependent on the steady airload on the tailplane. With both ailerons rigged in the up position the pressure distribution around the wing was altered and hence the trim load required from the tailplane.

The Supermarine fuselage was delivered to the Blackburn factory at Brough, where it was modified and the wing fitted. The completed HP.88 was taken by road to Carnaby near Bridlington, where it was flown for the first time on 21 June 1951. Testing by Blackburn revealed pitching oscillations at speeds above 230 knots. Modifications to the tailplane gave acceptable behaviour, with only minor oscillation, up to 450 knots (Mach 0.82). The HP.88 was delivered to Handley Page and on 6 August 1951 was flown to Stansted for further testing.

On 26 August 1951, in preparation for the 1951 SBAC Air Display at Farnborough, the HP.88 carried out a high-speed pass at 300 ft over Stansted, and was seen to start a pitching oscillation before breaking up in mid-air. The &quot;black box&quot; flight recorder subsequently showed pitching accelerations of +/-12g. The cause was traced to a tailplane control system servo instability involving a bob-weight that had been added as a safety measure. The HP.88 had only flown 14 hours in 26 sorties over a lifetime of just 36 days, and had little time to gather useful information, but the loss of the aircraft was of little significance to the V bomber project; two prototype Victors were already nearing completion by the time of the HP.88&#x27;s first flight.

<doc id="980007" wikidata="Q17116060" url="?curid=980007" title="High card by suit">
<text>High card by suit and low card by suit refer to assigning relative values to playing cards of equal rank based on their suit. When suit ranking is applied, the most common conventions from lowest to highest are:

; English alphabetical order: clubs, followed by diamonds, hearts, and spades.
: This ranking is used in the game of bridge.
; Alternating colors: Diamonds, followed by clubs, hearts, and spades. Similar to alphabetical ranking in that the two highest rankings are occupied by the same two suits (hearts and spades) in the same relative position to one another, but differing in the two lowest rankings, which while occupied by the same two suits (clubs and diamonds) have their relative position to one another swapped. 
: This ranking is sometimes used in the Chinese card game Big Two.
; High reds: Some Russian card games like Preference, 1000 etc. use the following order: spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts. 
: 500 also uses this ordering.
; Low reds: Some German card games like Skat use the following order: diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs.
; Chinese-Japanese-Korean conventional order: clubs, followed by hearts, diamonds, and spades.
: This ranking is commonly used in China, Japan, and South Korea, in their variants of Poker games.

==Poker==
Most poker games do not rank suits; the ace of clubs is just as good as the ace of spades. However, small issues (such as deciding who deals first) are sometimes resolved by dealing one card to each player. If two players draw cards of the same rank, one way to break the tie is to use an arbitrary hierarchy of suits. The order of suit rank differs by location; for example, the ranking most commonly used in the United States is not the one typically used in Italy.

Cards are always compared by rank first, and only then by suit. For example, using the &quot;alphabetical order&quot; of suits, the ace of clubs ranks higher than any king, but lower than the ace of diamonds. High card by suit is used to break ties between poker hands as a regional variance, but more commonly is used in the following situations, as well as various others, based upon the circumstances of the particular game:

* Randomly selecting a player or players.
:To randomly select a player to deal, to choose the game, to move to another table, or for other reasons, deal each player one card and the player with high card by suit is selected. Multiple players can be selected this way.

* Assigning the bring-in.
:In games such as Seven-card stud, where the player with the lowest-ranking face-up card is required to open the first betting round for a minimal amount, ties can be broken by suit. In such low stud games as razz, the player with the highest-ranking upcard must post the bring-in.

* Awarding odd chips in a split pot.
:In High-low split games, or when two players&#x27; hands tie, the pot must be split evenly between them. When there is an odd amount of money in the pot that can&#x27;t be split evenly, the odd low-denomination chip can be given to the player whose hand contains the high card by suit. (This solution is not necessary in games with blinds, in which case the odd chip between high and low is awarded to the high hand, and the odd chip between a split high or split low is awarded to the first player following the dealer button.)

* Breaking ties in a chip race
:During poker tournaments, a chip race is used to &quot;color up&quot; large numbers of smaller-denomination chips, and a modified deal is used to assign leftover chips. Ties in the deal are broken by suit.

==Contract bridge==
In bridge, suit rank during the bidding phase of the game is by ascending alphabetical order.

During the play of the cards, the trump suit is superior to all other suits and the other suits are of equal rank to each other. If there is no trump suit, all suits are of equal rank.

<text>Horrabridge is a village and civil parish in the West Devon district, in Devon, England with a population of 2,115 people in 2006, down from 2,204 in 1991. It is located approximately north of the city of Plymouth and south of Tavistock and is within the Dartmoor National Park. In 2021 the parish had a population of 2198. &quot;Horrabridge&quot; is a major part of Walkham electoral ward. The population at the 2011 census was 3,115.

It sits on the River Walkham, a fishing river famous for its salmon. The village&#x27;s name may have been taken from the 15th century pack-horse bridge which remains the only vehicular route from one side of the village to the other, and featured in the children&#x27;s television programme Bagpuss. The bridge is a Grade I listed building.

Horrabridge has two pubs the London Inn and The Leaping Salmon but has lost many of its shops over the last 20 years including a draper, television shop and a general store. The village does however retain its post office, family bakery, hairdresser, florist and newsagent.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the main industry was the mining of copper and tin. This industry has completely disappeared, leaving a legacy of unmapped mineshafts in the village and the surrounding area. It is a popular starting point for walks on Dartmoor and has become a dormitory village for the adjoining towns.

==Transport==

===Road===
The village is located on the A386 which is the main road running from Okehampton in the North to Plymouth in the South via Tavistock.

===Bus Services===
The main bus service is service 1 from Plymouth to Tavistock operated by Stagecoach seven days a week.

===Coach Excursions===
Lomax Tours run coach trips from Horrabridge to places of interest such as Bath Christmas Market, Lyme Regis, RHS Rosemoor flower shows, Sidmouth etc.

===The railway===
Horrabridge used to have a station in the 19th century but not any more.

==Sport==
Horrabridge has a football club associated with it; Horrabridge Rangers Sports Association. The football club has 2 adult teams and 20 youth teams of boys and girls. The football club has been around for over 100 years and provides a useful activity for the children of Horrabridge and the surrounding villages of Yelverton, Buckland Monachorum, Crapstone, Meavy and Walkhampton.

==Notable People==
Musician Seth Lakeman recorded his album &quot;Kitty Jay&quot; in Horrabridge.

==Twin Towns==

<doc id="980022" wikidata="Q3402699" url="?curid=980022" title="Pretenders II">
<text>Pretenders II is the second studio album by British-American rock band the Pretenders, issued on Sire Records in August 1981. It incorporates two songs that had been released as singles in the UK and placed on an EP in the US. It peaked at #7 on the UK Albums Chart and #10 on the Billboard 200, and has been certified a gold record for sales by the RIAA. It is the final album by the original line-up, as the following year bassist Pete Farndon was dismissed and guitarist James Honeyman-Scott died in the same week. Farndon died in 1983, and a new line-up would make the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Learning to Crawl&quot;.

==History==
The success of their 1979 debut album created a great demand for more material from the fledgling band; however, a lack of songs precluded the quick release of a follow-up album. In the UK, the band released two hit singles in 1980 and early 1981, &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; followed by &quot;Message of Love&quot;. In the US, where standalone singles had become rare, these tracks were combined with three others for a stopgap extended play release in March 1981 simply titled &quot;Extended Play&quot;. &quot;Pretenders II&quot; was released two months later to mixed critical reception arguably because many of the songs were viewed as too similar to (though not quite as groundbreaking as) the band&#x27;s debut. Nevertheless, several of the album&#x27;s songs became hits and the album has increased in critical stature with time.

As on their previous album, the band includes a song by Ray Davies of The Kinks, although in this case &quot;I Go to Sleep&quot;, written by Davies in 1965, was not recorded by the group. Band leader Chrissie Hynde and Davies were in a relationship at the time of the album&#x27;s recording, and would eventually have a daughter, Natalie Rae Hynde, in 1983. &quot;Talk of the Town&quot;, though rumoured to be about her relationship with Davies, was inspired by a fan Hynde had encountered on the band&#x27;s first tour and whom she regretted not speaking to at the time.

The album also includes the sexually-forward tunes &quot;Bad Boys Get Spanked&quot; and &quot;The Adultress&quot;, with perhaps the album&#x27;s most ambitious track, &quot;Day After Day&quot; spinning a common second-album narrative of unaccustomed celebrity, with the band rushing from gig to gig, hotel to hotel, head-spun from the swiftness of it all. The single version of the song ends with a guitar solo that gradually fades out; the album edit ends suddenly, mid-solo, with the sound of a crashing fighter plane. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, is an original composition and not a version of the identically titled and often covered song by Richard Berry.

In 2000 it was voted number 403 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The following year, twenty years after its release, it was certified gold in the United States.

==Reissues==
Rhino released a re-mastered edition of &quot;Pretenders II&quot; in 2006, including a second disc of live tracks and outtakes. Most of the tracks on the bonus disc originally appeared as a Warner Bros. 1982 promotional live album, &quot;Pretenders Live at the Santa Monica Civic&quot;. Specialist label Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs (known as MFSL or MoFi) released a re-mastered version in 2010. The track listing, however, reverted to that of the original release, without bonus tracks. A further 2015 reissue repeated the original album plus bonus disc of the 2006 version with two additional bonus tracks, this time including a DVD containing four promotional videos and two appearances by the band on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Another deluxe edition of the album, curated by Hynde, was released on 5 November 2021, and features the original album remastered by Chris Thomas, alongside demos, rarities, and two live performances. One is from a performance in Central Park, New York City, and the other from an electric performance at The Santa Monica Civic.

<text>Lieven de Key (1560 – 17 July 1627) was a Flemish renaissance architect who after working in his native Flanders moved to work in the Dutch Republic. He is mostly known today for his works in Haarlem. His style is described by Simon Schama as Mannerist.

==Biography==

De Key was born in Ghent, and was already a well-known architect when the Haarlem council invited him to become city architect in 1592 to succeed Wouter den Abt. He brought to Haarlem the same Renaissance style that Hendrick de Keyser brought to Amsterdam. Everything attributed to him or his followers, whether a building, a doorway, or merely a gable stone, is considered a rijksmonument today. 

The reason so many buildings in Haarlem can be attributed to him is because Haarlem had suffered a severe fire in 1576 that destroyed a third of the city, and plans were underway for large city projects when he was appointed city architect. Before working in Haarlem and Leiden, De Key had worked in London from 1580–1591. He died in Haarlem, aged about 77.

In more recent times, many street names, buildings and e.g. one of the largest housing companies in Amsterdam, have been named after him. 

==Buildings designed==

* Front facade of the city hall of Leiden
* The Vleeshal in Haarlem, 1602–1603
* The gymnasium in Leiden
* The tower of the St. Anna church in Haarlem, which still exists, though the rest of the church was demolished and rebuilt by Jacob van Campen
* The Waag in Haarlem, 1595
* North wing of the city hall of Haarlem, 1620
* The stone entranceway to the Proveniershuis in Haarlem, 1592
* The facade of the main hall of the Frans Hals Museum, 1604–1609
* The gateway of the St. Barbara Gasthuis, 1624

He married English actress, dancer, and television presenter Rosemarie Ford on 31 December 2006.

On 13 September 2006, Lindsay researched his family tree in the third series of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; He travelled to his hometown and to Turkey, where his grandfather, Raymond Dunmore, had taken part in the Gallipoli campaign during World War I.

Lindsay is a lifelong supporter of Derby County F.C., which he revealed in a short section on the CBBC programme &quot;Newsround&quot; entitled &quot;My Team&quot;.

Lindsay is known for his left-wing political beliefs, usually describing himself as a staunch socialist, and has marched in support of miners. He is a passionate supporter of the Labour Party, but an outspoken critic of then Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s controversial decisions to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003, saying that he was &quot;furious&quot; and feeling disillusioned with mainstream politics: &quot;You see those images of Iraq and Afghanistan and Lebanon, don&#x27;t you? And I suspect somewhere, when he goes home at night and the kids are in bed, he must go, &#x27;Jesus, what have I done?&#x27;&quot;

In 2011, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which was treated surgically.

Lindsay has suffered from depressive episodes and symptoms of seasonal affective disorder in winter months for most of his life. He has spoken publicly about his positive experiences with light therapy and counselling, saying that &quot;they really do work&quot;.

<text>Blythe Bridge () is a village in Staffordshire, England, south-east of Stoke-on-Trent.

==Etymology==
Blythe Bridge is so called as it is built around the site of a bridge over the River Blithe (spelt differently from the name of the village itself), a small river which passes directly through the village.

==Today==

===Facilities===
It has a high school and sixth form, library, as well as a public house, The Black Cock on Uttoxeter Road. The Smithfield and The White Cock were demolished due to the construction of two housing estates and The Duke of Wellington is now a Tesco Express. The village also has a bakery, mortgage shop, betting shop, newsagents, motor garage, GP surgery, a micropub, a few hairdressers and some fast-food outlets. The library is joined to Blythe Bridge High School and Blythe Bridge Youth Centre. The Duke of Wellington is now a Tesco Express after its closure as a pub in early 2013.

===Media===
Blythe Bridge is covered by The Blythe and Forsbrook Times, a weekly newspaper. It is produced by Times, Echo and Life Publications (established 1896), which publish the only independent family owned and run newspapers in North Staffordshire.

===Schools===
*Blythe Bridge High School
*Springcroft Primary School
*Forsbrook Primary School
*William Amory Primary School

==Transport==

===Rail===
Train services are available at Blythe Bridge railway station, which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 7 August 1848, on the Crewe to Derby railway line. The station buildings and signal box have been demolished. The line currently runs from Crewe to Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire.

A Heritage railway, Foxfield Light Railway operate north of the village, with the southern terminus, Caverswall Road, being north of the main line station along Blythe Bridge Road.

===Road===

The Uttoxeter Road, a former major motorway link route (M1 to M6) was partially relieved by the A50 dual-carriageway. The bypass road opened in 1975, and then the section to Uttoxeter in 1985.

===Air===

The nearby Meir Aerodrome closed in 1973 and the land was used to build the large Meir Park housing estate.

<text>Robert Lindsay (c. 1735 – 1801) was an American politician who was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly of 1777.

==Life story==
Robert Lindsay was the son of John Lindsay, but there are conflicting accounts as to their background and Robert&#x27;s early life. One account says he was born c. 1735. He may have been born in Virginia or Ireland. He was descended from the ancient and illustrious Clan Lindsay of Scotland. Evidently, he lived for a time on the Pennsylvania/Maryland border area before coming to North Carolina in the mid-18th century. His name first appears in the North Carolina records in 1763. He died in 1801.

Lindsay established a 2,000 acre (8 km2) plantation on Deep River in what later became Guilford County. In fact, when the county was formed in 1771, and until a court house could be built in 1774, the county court met in the &quot;great hall&quot; of his plantation home. The property included an ordinary (an inn/tavern), formal gardens, a mulberry grove for raising silk worms, a silk mill, a grist mill, and a store. A fragment of the original house remains.

Robert Lindsay was a captain in the North Carolina Militia. He served in the first independent North Carolina Legislature from 1777 to 1778, and was presiding Judge of Guilford County from 1781 to 1788. He was a well known and respected member of his community, and his descendants were prominent in the history of North Carolina.

Robert married twice:
# His first wife was Elizabeth Mebane with whom he had two children:
## Elizabeth, who died young
## John A. Lindsay (1767–1828) who married Elizabeth Wilson and raised a large family in Davidson County, NC.
# Lindsay&#x27;s second wife was Ann &quot;Nancy&quot; McGee (1753/4-1832), a daughter of Colonel John McGee (d.1773), whom he married on 23 June 1772. They had eight children:
## Senator Samuel Lindsay (c.1774-1813, m. Henrietta Causey)
## Colonel Robert Lindsay, Jr. (1776–1818, m. Letitia Harper, father of Ann Eliza Lindsay Morehead)
## William Lindsay (1777–1841, m. Elisabeth Briggs)
## Jane Lindsay (1779–1827, m. Jesse Hargrave)
## Elizabeth Lindsay (1784–1825, m. Rev. Samuel Craighead Caldwell)
## Andrew Lindsay (1786–1844, m. Elizabeth Dick)
## Susannah Lindsay (1789–1857, m. Dr. Joseph Wood)
## David Lindsay (1793–1860, m. Sarah Dillon).
