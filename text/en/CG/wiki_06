<text>Magic Radio is a British digital radio station owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK. The station is available on 105.4 FM in London and across the UK on DAB Digital Radio, via Bauer&#x27;s Rayo platform, and on Smart speakers. It plays &quot;adult contemporary&quot; such as Elton John, Madonna, Ed Sheeran, Whitney Houston, UB40, Simply Red, and more.

It had previously been a part of a network of Magic stations broadcast on FM in London and on MW across northern England and began broadcasting across the UK via the Digital One multiplex in January 2015. On 5 January 2015, Magic Radio launched nationally on DAB and all other Magic stations were dissolved to form the Bauer City 2 network.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 4.4 million with a listening share of 5.4% as of March 2024.

==History==
The Magic name was first used in 1990 when Leeds station Radio Aire launched an oldies station called Magic 828 on its MW frequency. Seven years later, the Magic brand was rolled out on MW across Yorkshire and north east England and the stations adopted a soft adult contemporary music format.

In 1998, easy music station Melody FM, which had also launched in 1990, was purchased by media group Emap from Hanson plc for a reported £25 million and rebranded to Magic that December and the change saw Emap introduce automation for the first time - weekday afternoons were split with a &#x27;non-stop music hour&#x27;, first sponsored by the now defunct energy company &quot;Calortex&quot;, and later by the Emap-owned &quot;Red&quot; magazine. Magic was criticised for automating a further eleven hours of its daily output (7pm-6am) given the reach and size of the station.

In an attempt to cut costs, Magic began networking its mid-morning show, hosted by Richard Skinner, and automated overnight output with the eight other Magic stations in the North of England in January 2002. Audience figures fell on all nine stations in the twelve months that followed, some arguing a lack of local content had driven listeners to tune away. Networking was ended in January 2003, although the eight &#x27;northern&#x27; Magic stations continued to share a mid-morning show, hosted by Mark Thorburn, and were subsequently networked again, with the exception of local breakfast shows, following a repositioning of the northern Magic group in mid-2006. These stations were later rebranded into the Bauer City 2 network in 2015.

The end of networking heralded a programming shift; Magic adopting its &#x27;more music, less talk&#x27; ethos. Former Capital FM head and radio consultant Richard Park was brought in to increase the station&#x27;s audience share. In September 2003, Magic saw its first major revamp: live programming replaced automated output in the evening, and Independent Radio News-employed personnel staffed the station&#x27;s daytime news output, removing shared presenting/newsreading responsibilities, a legacy from Melody FM. IRN retained the contract to supply Magic&#x27;s news bulletins until 2015, when the service was brought in-house.

Later years saw a reliance on weekend celebrity-hosted content and large cash prizes to entice listeners - the award of £110,600 to Nicola Diss, the winner of the popular &quot;Magic Mystery Voices&quot; contest on 12 January 2006 was the largest cash prize given away on UK radio since 1999, a sum surpassed just a few months later by the prize collected by listener Dawn Muggleton in the &quot;Smooth Secret Song&quot; competition on London rival 102.2 Smooth FM, scooping £118,454 on 19 April 2006. However, Magic regained the honour on 30 March 2007 with listener Maria Crosskey winning £168,600 in a six-month-long &quot;Mystery Voices&quot; contest, although she was later disqualified (see &#x27;Mystery Voices&#x27; below).

In 2008, Emap sold its radio stations, including Magic, to Bauer Media Group.

Magic, along with urban-music station Kiss, rock music station Absolute Radio and a number of other radio brands, broadcasts from Bauer Radio&#x27;s headquarters at The Lantern in Euston. It had previously broadcast from studios on Winsley Street (Mappin House), and, from September 2014 to March 2024, Golden Square in Soho.

On 2 April 2024, Magic ceased transmitting on the Freeview digital television platform after 21 years, as it and other Bauer stations completed their withdrawal from linear TV platforms, having dropped satellite transmission in late 2023.

On 27 December 2024, Magic rebranded to Magic Radio dropping the strapline &quot;More Of The Songs You Love&quot; and changing it to &quot;The Best Variety from the 80s to Now&quot; Magic Radio refreshed their jingles which is now branded as &quot;Magic Radio&quot; instead of &quot;Magic&quot; The station also changed their format, moving from soft adult contemporary to adult contemporary, playing more music from the 2010s and 2020s, retaining the usual 80s, 90s &amp; 00s music.

==Sister stations==
=== Magic Chilled ===
Launched March 2016 and playing &quot;laid back hits&quot;, predominantly pop and R&#x27;n&#x27;B from the 90s to today (which ended up as the slogan for the station: Pop + R&#x27;B: 90&#x27;s-Now);the format originated as an evening programme strand on Heat Radio (as &#x27;heat Chilled&#x27;) but moved under the Magic brand to be launched as a full-time station, and as a permanent part of the network. Magic Chilled was Bauer&#x27;s first DAB+ station. It was originally broadcast on the national Sound Digital multiplex, moved to local tier DAB, in capacity previously used by Absolute Radio 90s, in early 2019 as part of the reorganisation of space for the launch of Scala Radio, then reverted to broadcast on Sound Digital in DAB+ in October 2023, following the conversion of stations including Scala and Mellow Magic to DAB+. In London, Magic Chilled continued to be broadcast in DAB+ at the same bitrate as before but in stereo

At 7PM (UK) on Monday 16th September 2024, Magic Chilled was formally rebranded and relaunched across all platforms under the new name of Hits Radio Chilled,with the new slogan &quot;Laid-Back Hits &amp; Throwbacks&quot;. This tied in to the Hits Radio slogan &quot;The Biggest Hits, The Biggest Throwbacks&quot;. This followed an announcement in July, and weeks of jingles being rebranded to the Hits Radio jingle and voices informing people of the change. This move, one of a few shake-ups in the Bauer UK radio portfolio, transferred the station to the Hits Radio Network, another of Bauer Media UK&#x27;s radio brands and networks. Cian Ducrot presented the first show under the new name, and with his song &quot;All For You&quot; being the first track on the new station.
=== Mellow Magic ===
Mellow Magic is a digital-only service of timeless relaxing classics, launched in March 2016 along with Magic Chilled. It continues to broadcast as part of the Sound Digital national multiplex jointly owned by Bauer. The Mellow Magic station was built on the successful Magic night-time programming strand of the same name. Fran Godfrey has hosted the breakfast show on Mellow Magic, since the station&#x27;s official launch; the station previously simulcast the Mellow Magic programmes of the main Magic station, but this ceased when Magic temporarily flipped to a Christmas music format. in autumn 2023; shortly afterward, Mellow Magic switched its digital radio broadcast from mono DAB to stereo DAB+ but ultimately remained active as a permanent part of the network.

=== Magic Soul ===
This was originally a temporary pop-up service, branded as Magic Soul Summer, which launched in the summer of 2016 largely taking over the capacity previously occupied by the temporary Magic ABBA station; the soul service ultimately remained active as a permanent part of the network, truncating its name to Magic Soul from Autumn 2016 onwards. The station broadcast on local DAB until moving to broadcast in stereo DAB+ in October 2023 along with Magic Chilled, Mellow Magic and Magic at the Musicals.

=== Magic at the Musicals ===
Launched on DAB+ in London on 21 November 2019; the station has since been rolled out to several other areas, chiefly on selected Bauer-owned multiplexes, in standard DAB, moving to broadcast nationally on stereo DAB+ in October 2023, but ultimately remained active as a permanent part of the network. It plays show-tunes and soundtracks.

===Pop-ups===
====Magic ABBA====
Following the migration of other Bauer services (including Kisstory and Heat Radio) to SDL, some of the vacated space at local level was used during the spring of 2016 for a short-term pop-up, playing ABBA songs (and versions thereof) and related content. It ran as a commercial partnership with &quot;Mamma Mia!: the Musical&quot;.

====Magic Workout====
An online-only sibling, Magic Workout has been made available as one of a suite of streaming-only Bauer services. The temporary service formed part of Magic&#x27;s partnership with breast cancer charity Walk The Walk&#x27;s &quot;Moonwalk&quot; event.
A similar service, Cool FM Workout, was launched by Bauer in partnership with the Belfast City Marathon in 2021.

====Magic Christmas / Magic 100% Christmas====
In late 2017, a slot on the Digital One multiplex which had been occupied since the summer by Kiss Fresh was temporarily used by a Christmas music station under the Magic Christmas banner; it was one of two festive stations available on D1 that year, with Heart Extra making its annual switch to &quot;Heart Extra Christmas&quot; around the same time. (During 2018, this capacity was used by Absolute Radio 90s, and since February 2019 the space has been occupied by Kisstory). In December 2018 and 2019, the main Magic station flipped to an all-Christmas playlist, and so a discrete Christmas station was not provided.

Magic 100% Christmas was launched online in August 2020, several months earlier than previous Christmas music stations in order to, according to Bauer, help lift the mood of the nation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike the earlier Magic Christmas, this service did not broadcast on DAB.

====Bond 24/7====
Bond 24/7 was a pop-up station which ran from 29 September to 6 October 2021. It was launched to mark the release of the 25th film in the James Bond series &quot;No Time to Die&quot; and would play music from the James Bond films.

===Television===
====Magic TV====
There was also a complementary Magic-branded music television channel available on the Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media digital TV platforms in the UK, operating as part of The Box Plus Network. The channel played classic and contemporary melodic pop hits.

<doc id="974931" wikidata="Q14359" url="?curid=974931" title="Owl Nebula">
<text>The Owl Nebula (also known as Messier 97, M97 or NGC 3587) is a planetary nebula approximately 2,030 light years away in the constellation Ursa Major. Estimated to be about 8,000 years old, it is approximately circular in cross-section with a faint internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20–30% larger than the inner shell. The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45° to the line of sight.

The nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses () of matter, including hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per cubic centimeter. Its outer radius is around and it is expanding with velocities in the range of 27–39 km/s into the surrounding interstellar medium.

The 14th magnitude central star has passed the turning point in its evolution and is condensing to form a white dwarf. It has 55–60% of solar mass, is 41 to 148 times solar luminosity (), and has an effective temperature of 123,000 K. The star has been successfully resolved by the Spitzer Space Telescope as a point source that does not show the infrared excess characteristic of a circumstellar disk.

== History ==
The Owl Nebula was discovered by French astronomer Pierre Méchain on February 16, 1781. Pierre Méchain was Charles Messier&#x27;s observing colleague, and the nebula was observed by Messier himself a few weeks following the initial sighting. Thus, the object was named Messier 97, and included in his catalog on March 24, 1781. Of the object, he noted:Nebula in the great Bear, near Beta: It is difficult to see, reports M. Méchain, especially when one illuminates the micrometer wires: its light is faint, without a star. M. Méchain saw it the first time on Feb 16, 1781, &amp; the position is that given by him. Near this nebula he has seen another one, [the position of] which has not yet been determined [Messier 108], and also a third which is near Gamma of the Great Bear [Messier 109]. (diam. 2′).In 1844, Admiral William H. Smyth classified the object as a planetary nebula. When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in Ireland in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl&#x27;s head. In his notes, the object was described as &quot;Two stars considerably apart in the central region, dark penumbra round each spiral arrangement, with stars as apparent centres of attraction. Stars sparkling in it; resolvable.&quot; It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since. More recent developments in the late 1900s include the discovery of a giant red halo of wind extended around its inner shells, and the mapping of the nebula&#x27;s structure.

== Observing ==
Although the Owl Nebula can not be seen with the naked eye, a faint image of it can be observed under remarkably good conditions with a small telescope or 20×80 binoculars. To make out the nebula&#x27;s more distinctive owl like eye features, a telescope with an aperture 10&quot; or better is required. To locate the nebula in the night sky, look to the southwest corner of the Big Dipper&#x27;s bowl, marked by the star Beta Ursae Majoris. From there, M97 lies just over 2.5 degrees in the southeast direction towards the star positioned opposite Beta Ursae Majoris in the other bottom corner of the Big Dippers Bowl, Gamma Ursae Majoris; which marks the constellations southwest corner. M97, together with Alpha Ursae Majoris, point the way to Polaris.

<text>Messier 98, M98 or NGC 4192, is an intermediate spiral galaxy about 44.4 million light-years away in slightly northerly Coma Berenices, about 6° to the east of the bright star Denebola (Beta Leonis). It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre Méchain on 1781, along with nearby M99 and M100, and was catalogued by compatriot Charles Messier 29 days later in his . It has a blueshift, denoting ignoring of its fast other movement (vectors of proper motion), it is approaching at about 140 km/s.

The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(s)ab, which indicates it is a spiral galaxy that displays mixed barred and non-barred features with intermediate to tightly wound arms and no ring. It is highly inclined to the line of sight at an angle of 74° and has a maximum rotation velocity of 236 km/s. The combined mass of the stars in this galaxy is an estimated 76 billion () times the mass of the Sun. It contains about 4.3 billion solar masses of neutral hydrogen and 85 million solar masses in dust. The nucleus is active, displaying characteristics of a &quot;transition&quot; type object. That is, it shows properties of a LINER-type galaxy intermixed with an H II region around the nucleus.

Messier 98 is a member of the Virgo Cluster, which is a large cluster of galaxies, part of the local supercluster. 

About 750 million years ago, it may have interacted with the large spiral galaxy Messier 99. These are now separated by .

<doc id="974944" wikidata="Q1412796" url="?curid=974944" title="Zot!">
<text>Zot! is a comic book created by Scott McCloud in 1984 and published by Eclipse Comics until 1990 as a lighthearted alternative to the darker and more violent comics that dominated the industry during that period. There were a total of 36 issues, with the first ten in color and the remainder in black and white.

==Creation==
McCloud credited &quot;Astro Boy&quot; creator Osamu Tezuka as a major influence on the book, making it one of the first manga-inspired American comic books. He also cited &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; as inspirations.

==Publication history==
Despite critical acclaim, &quot;Zot!&quot; was initially cancelled after 10 issues due to low sales in July 1985. However, McCloud and Eclipse came up with the idea of switching from color to black-and-white, and the comic was then able to run profitably from January 1987 to July 1991 before McCloud ended the series after a total of 36 issues. Issues #19-20 shipped together, and due to McCloud&#x27;s honeymoon featured Chuck Austen inking the artist&#x27;s pencils.

Eclipse planned to print the color issues as trade paperbacks to support the revived series, but the original color negatives were destroyed when their Guerneville, California headquarters flooded in 1986. Instead Eclipse funded new color separations by Dennis McFarling. &quot;The Original Zot! Book One&quot; () was released in August 1989 which collected issues 1–4 and included an introduction by McCloud. &quot;The Original Zot! Book Two&quot; followed in June 1990, containing issues 5-8.

Although the comic has been out of print, following the collapse of Eclipse it was collected by Kitchen Sink Press in Book One (), which collected issues 1–10 and included an introduction by Kurt Busiek; Book 2 (), which collected issues 11–15 and 17–18; and Book 3 () which collected issues 16 and 21–27. Book 4, collecting the &quot;real world arc&quot; of issues 28–36, was a casualty of Kitchen Sink&#x27;s turmoil.

In 2000, ten years after the last print issue appeared, McCloud brought the series back in webcomic format under the title Zot! Online. He published the 440-panel story arc &quot;Hearts And Minds&quot; at &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;. McCloud used an infinite canvas style for &quot;Zot! Online&quot;, using trails to instruct the reader what the reading order of the panels are.

In July 2008, HarperCollins published the complete black and white issues of the series (11–36) in one volume. This edition included never-before-seen material and commentary by McCloud. It did not include the published &quot;Getting to 99&quot; story, but only McCloud&#x27;s breakdowns, as the art was done by another artist, Chuck Austen. In addition, HarperCollins published a limited, signed collector&#x27;s edition of this collection in November 2008.

==Plot summary==

=== Issues 1–10: &quot;Key to the Door&quot; ===
Jenny Weaver, a normal lonely girl recently relocated to a new town, stumbles across Zot, a superhero from an alternate world who is chasing a troop of robots in pursuit of a key that will open a door hanging out in space. Jenny returns with Zot and her brother Butch to his world. They retrieve the key and take it to the authorities, but it is stolen again. Eventually their pursuit leads them to Sirius IV, a drab theocratic planet, home of the key. While there they uncover a plot to use the key, and the subsequent door opening, as an excuse to lead a holy war against Earth. To foil the plot Zot and Jenny take themselves through the door where they converse with the spirit of Sirius IV. Once out again they lead the revolt against the acting leader of planet who is tricked into goading his subjects on live television. Zot defeats the tyrant, but refuses to lead the planet, stating that they must learn to look after themselves.

=== Issues 11–27 ===
The next sequence features a series of super villains, each of which Zot must defeat in turn.
* Ignatius Rumboult Bellows was his planet&#x27;s foremost scientist, pioneering the Industrial Revolution, but all his work is made obsolete when more sophisticated worlds share their technology. Bellows responds by determining that he will wipe out the technocrats of Earth.
* Zybox was a huge supercomputer, channelling most of North and South America&#x27;s communication. When his creator is let go by the government, Zybox escapes to our world, plotting to kill everyone simultaneously and steal a soul for himself in an attempt to fully understand the human condition.
* A cult of de-evolutionaries who believe that coming down from the trees was a bad idea turn the lead cast into monkeys, before Zot manages to save the day.
* Dekko, a villain previously seen in the Key arc, engineers his release from a mental institution and turns up to Zot&#x27;s birthday party. He is apparently determined to destroy the universe and recreate it with his own sense of order, but instead ends up delving further into his own psychosis.
* Getting to 99 is the only story not drawn by McCloud and features Zot flying deep into the bowels of an underground city (to the 99th floor) just in time to prevent it from being accidentally blown up.
* The Blotch was a gangster with a purple splotch for a head, who appears to be made entirely of some form of viscous liquid. When he becomes upset he loses control of his physical form and &quot;melts down&quot; into a large puddle.
* 9-Jack-9 (J9AC9K), who also featured in the Key to the Door arc, was an electronically transmitted assassin hired to finish off the president and his family of a distant planet. Zot tracks him down to his base, and during the ensuing battle Jack accidentally electrocutes his human operator, Sir John Shears. However, Jack, the programme, survives independently.
* Following a poll in which Zot! readers could vote for a character to be hit by a pie in the face, a special New Year&#x27;s party is held in which all the villains and friends of Zot turn up, with said pie making many forays into the air, until finally hitting one of the assembled cast. At the end of this story Zot is stranded on Earth.

=== Issues 28–36 ===
These stories are usually referred to as the &quot;Earth stories&quot; as they feature Zot being stranded on Jenny&#x27;s Earth. They are more character driven than the earlier stories and focus on Jenny&#x27;s band of misfit friends. The final culmination of the arc is a cliff hanger in which the whole ensemble leaves to go to Zot&#x27;s world, though not permanently. The arc also contained an entire Eisner Award nominated issue with Zot and Jenny talking about sex, and an issue dealing with Jenny&#x27;s friend Terry being a lesbian.

=== Issues 10½ and 14½ ===
Matt Feazell usually drew a non-canonical stick figure back-up strip to &quot;Zot!&quot; in which the characters from the main story were featured in absurd or surreal situations, as well as having crossovers with Feazell&#x27;s work and other Eclipse books. For two issues Feazell was allowed to take the helm and produced these stories, set in &quot;dimension 10½&quot;, with McCloud providing a one-page back-up to issue 14.

==Themes==
Throughout &quot;Zot!&quot;″s run the principal theme is the contrast between Zot&#x27;s utopian world and Jenny&#x27;s flawed version. The two lead characters find each other&#x27;s worlds fascinating: Jenny desiring the tranquility of the parallel world and Zot embracing the challenges of Earth. Later on, teenage sexuality, bigotry, homosexuality and a sense of not belonging are all explored in a sensitive way, displaying Zot (and by association his world) as socially liberal.

==Characters==
===Heroes===
* Zot (Zachary T. Paleozogt) – a blond haired, blue eyed teenage hero from an alternate Earth who flies via gravity boots and fights villains with a ten-shooter laser gun and boundless optimism.
* Jenny Weaver – a sensitive teenage girl from our world and the reader&#x27;s point-of-view character throughout the series.
* Butch – Jenny&#x27;s older brother, a typical blustering bully who, after a mishap in the first issue of the series, is transformed into a talking chimpanzee whenever he is on Zot&#x27;s world.
* Uncle Max – Zot&#x27;s uncle, an eccentric inventor, artist and surrogate parent whose gadgets help Zot fight crime.
* Peabody – Zot&#x27;s robot butler/guardian.
* Woody – Jenny&#x27;s nerdy but sweet &quot;boyfriend&quot; and close friend for the majority of the series 
* Terry – Jenny&#x27;s best friend
* Ronnie – a comic book obsessed writer
* Brandy – Ronnie&#x27;s girlfriend, a thin bubbly, slightly ditzy, girl with an alcoholic mother
* George – a lazy genius determined to get straight D&#x27;s only
* Spike (Bob) – a violent and rude comic book nerd
* Elizabeth – Spike&#x27;s extremely quiet and fairly odd sister

===Villains===
Zot and his friends faced a number of enemies, including:
* Bellows – The main villain of the second arc and the only one of two villains (the other being Zybox) who was not introduced in the colour arc. Bellows is a psychopathic, megalomaniacal, and socially awkward inventor whose planet used to be dependent on his inventions before they were replaced by creations by another inventor. Bellows lost his mind and traveled to Zot’s planet, where they clashed before Bellows mysteriously traveled to Earth alongside Zot, where he was defeated. He reappears in the “Ring in the New” arc as The Blotch’s friend.
* 9-Jack-9 – assassin for hire who can travel through any electrical signal. Originally the astral projection of a man named Sir John Sheers, he was killed by Zot. Upon his death his astral form remained and is now a being of pure energy, even more dangerous than before. 
* Dekko (Arthur Dekker) – Max&#x27;s friend turned madman who slowly replaced his cancer-ridden body with robotic parts.
* The Devoes – a cult of humans who believe that coming out of the trees was a bad idea, hence the name de-evolutionaries. Use de-evolutionary guns to &quot;revert&quot; humans back into monkeys. They are generally unintelligent, and rarely have any chain of command (with the exception of Butch in the colour run), and wear football outfits.
* Zybox – a supercomputer hoping to acquire a soul.
* The Blotch – a gangster/businessman with a warped face trying to stay out of jail. When he feels any important emotional reaction, he may turn into a mass of strange liquid. In “Ring in the New” it is revealed that he can shape-shift when he turns into a cycloptic being.

==Zot&#x27;s Earth==
Using a portal created by Uncle Max, a link is created from contemporary Earth to the alternate reality of Zot. It is a retro-futuristic technological utopia, reminiscent of imagery from Golden Age SF, flying cars, robots and interplanetary travel are common and nearly all of its inhabitants benefit from peace, prosperity and a marked lack of conventional social ills. There also seem to be subtle differences in the essential nature of the two Earths, as on Zot&#x27;s world events naturally favor the &quot;good guys&quot; in any conflict. Still, there are several commonalities between Zot&#x27;s world and the &quot;real&quot; Earth, such as the careers of several popular musicians.

On Zot&#x27;s utopian Earth, the year is permanently 1965. The inhabitants of Zot&#x27;s world are unable to notice this, although Jenny and her friends from their Earth realize it. The true nature of Zot&#x27;s world is never truly explained in the comic, and is left as a loose end, but it is hinted that Zot&#x27;s world is a copy of the real one.

==Reception==
Chester Brown was among those to praise the series. Several &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; reviewers were also highly positive about &quot;Zot!&quot;, including Andy Mangels, Edd Vick, T.M. Maple, and Eddie Sacks.

It is the group&#x27;s final studio album to feature the quartet of Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin and Bill Bruford, which broke up later that year, though all four would appear in the sextet lineup featured on &quot;THRAK&quot; in 1995.

== Music ==

According to Robert Fripp, the album &quot;presents two distinct sides of the band’s personality, which has caused at least as much confusion for the group as it has the public and the industry. The left side is accessible, the right side excessive.&quot;

The &quot;other side&quot; of bonus material on the 2001 CD remaster consists of two instrumental outtakes from the 1983 sessions, three alternate mixes of &quot;Sleepless&quot;, and a 1989 a cappella recording (first published in the 1991 &quot;Frame By Frame&quot; box set) in which Tony Levin performs the barbershop quartet &quot;The King Crimson Barber Shop&quot;.

American hip hop duo Gang Starr would sample &quot;Dig Me&quot; on &quot;Words I Manifest (Remix)&quot; from their 1989 debut album &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;.

== Title and artwork ==
The title of the album is based on the idea of “perfect opposites”, or someone&#x27;s truth, someone else&#x27;s truth, and an objective truth (the idea of “three sides to every story”).

The Peter Willis designed artwork illustrates the sacred–profane dichotomy while being a simplified version of the &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; cover; a rising phallic object represents a male solar deity about to penetrate the crescent figure, a female lunar deity. According to Fripp, the artwork is “a presentation of a reconciliation of Western &amp; Eastern Christianity...the front cover has the two elements, representing the male &amp; female principles. The back cover has the third element drawing together &amp; reconciling the preceding opposite terms”.

== Release and reception ==
Released in March 1984, &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; peaked at number 30 in the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; described it in a mixed review as &quot;a most disjunct album from a band that prided itself on carefully matched contradictions. The Left Side sports four of Adrian Belew&#x27;s poorer songs and a self-derivative instrumental; the flip is nearly all-instrumental, nearly free-form, nearly brilliant...apparently the Frippressive &#x27;discipline&#x27; that forged the critically acclaimed pop/art synthesis of the first two latter-day Crimson albums is not a permanent condition.&quot;

A 5.1 surround sound mix of the album by Fripp and Steven Wilson was released in October 2016 for the band&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Series as a standalone CD/DVD package and as part of the &quot;On (and off) The Road (1981–1984)&quot; box set.

<text>Messier 99 or M99, also known as NGC 4254 or St. Catherine&#x27;s Wheel, is a grand design spiral galaxy in the northern constellation Coma Berenices approximately from the Milky Way. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain on 17 March 1781. The discovery was then reported to Charles Messier, who included the object in the Messier Catalogue of comet-like objects. It was one of the first galaxies in which a spiral pattern was seen. This pattern was first identified by Lord Rosse in the spring of 1846.

This galaxy has a morphological classification of SA(s)c, indicating a pure spiral shape with loosely wound arms. It has a peculiar shape with one normal looking arm and an extended arm that is less tightly wound. The galaxy is inclined by 42° to the line-of-sight with a major axis position angle of 68°.

A bridge of neutral hydrogen gas links NGC 4254 with VIRGOHI21, an HI region and a possible dark galaxy. The gravity from the latter may have distorted M99 and drawn out the gas bridge, as the two galaxy-sized objects may have had a close encounter before parting greatly. However, VIRGOHI21 may instead be tidal debris from an interaction with the lenticular galaxy NGC 4262 some 280 million years ago. It is expected that the drawn out arm will relax to match the normal arm once the encounter is over.

While not classified as a starburst galaxy, M99 has a star formation activity three times larger than other galaxies of similar Hubble type that may have been triggered by the encounter. M99 is likely entering the Virgo Cluster for the first time bound to the periphery of the cluster at a projected separation of 3.7°, or around one megaparsec, from the cluster center at Messier 87. The galaxy is undergoing ram-pressure stripping of much of its interstellar medium as it moves through the intracluster medium.

==Supernovae==
Four supernovae have been observed in M99:
* SN 1967H (type II, mag. 14.0) was discovered by Fritz Zwicky on 1 July 1967.
* SN 1972Q (type unknown, mag. 15.8) was discovered by Leonida Rosino on 14 December 1972.
* SN 1986I (type II, mag. 14) was discovered by Carlton Pennypacker et al. on 17 May 1986.
* SN 2014L (type Ic, mag. 17.2) was discovered by the THU-NAOC Transient Survey (TNTS) on 26 January 2014.

<text>Victor Alexander Vyssotsky (February 26, 1931 – December 24, 2012) was a mathematician and computer scientist. He was the technical head of the Multics project at Bell Labs and later executive director of Research in the Information Systems Division of AT&amp;T Bell Labs. Multics, whilst not particularly commercially successful in itself, directly inspired Ken Thompson to develop Unix. Later, Vyssotsky was the founding director of Digital&#x27;s Cambridge Research Lab.

In 1960, Vyssotsky co-created the BLODI Block Diagram Compiler at Bell Labs. In 1961, together with Robert Morris Sr. and Doug McIlroy, he devised the computer game Darwin (later known as Core War) on an IBM 7090 at Bell Labs.

<doc id="974962" wikidata="Q5161381" url="?curid=974962" title="Connect Radio 97.2 &amp; 107.4">
<text>Connect FM was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Northamptonshire and Peterborough and the home counties. It was owned by Adventure Radio and based in Kettering.

On 7 February 2019, the station was purchased by Communicorp UK, merging with the group’s existing East Midlands license, now rebranded as Smooth East Midlands. The station played &#x27;hit music&#x27; songs from the 1980s to the present day, with a selection of presenters. Connect FM closed and its FM frequencies were merged with Smooth East Midlands on 1 October 2019. Its DAB transmissions were rebranded as Radio Up.

==History==

The station launched as KCBC on 6 April 1990 on 1530 kHz AM. The original daytime line-up consisted of Howard Rose at breakfast time, followed by Tony Harrison, Terry Doyle, Mark Jeeves and Andy Jackson. It originally broadcast a Golden Oldies format, playing hits from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, in addition to local news bulletins and sports coverage. In 1992, the station switched frequency to 1584 kHz.

For a few years in the early 1990s, a few shows on KCBC were broadcast from a local school Brooke Weston City Technology College which housed a radio studio, allowing students the chance to try out working in a professional studio and even go on air.

In 1996, KCBC was purchased by The Local Radio Company. The station transferred to FM in March 1998, broadcasting on 107.4 MHz in Kettering and Corby, with a sister station, Connect FM, in Wellingborough, on 97.2 MHz. During this time KCBC was broadcast from Telford Way Industrial Estate in Kettering, while Connect FM broadcast from a small studio on the top floor of Tresham College in Wellingborough.

In August 1999, the station&#x27;s new owners, Jersey-based Hub Trans Communications, merged KCBC and Connect FM, rebranding them as Connect 97.2 and 107.4, and co-locating both stations at Telford Way Industrial Estate in Kettering. The station changed hands again in May 2000, when it was bought by Forward Media. In 2007, Connect was granted permission by OFCOM to relocate to Peterborough at the headquarters of Lite FM, another station operated by Forward Media. In 2010 Connect FM moved back to Kettering after acquiring the old Tollers solicitors building in the Headlands.

In 2009, Connect was acquired by Adventure Radio. The station drew its playlist from the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, under the banner of &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Mix For Northamptonshire and Peterborough&quot; and in 2011, Connect FM launched a &quot;No Repeat Nine To Five&quot; format that guaranteed listeners wouldn&#x27;t hear the same song twice during the working day. It provided hourly local news bulletins between 6am and 7pm on weekdays, 7am and 1pm on Saturdays and 8am and 1pm on Sundays.

In July 2016 the station owners Adventure Radio signed a management contract with Communicorp which would see them offer extra support to both Connect FM and Heart Hertfordshire. In 2019 Communicorp agreed to buy the services, with a view to replacing Connect FM with Smooth East Midlands.

At the time of its closure in 2019, Connect FM&#x27;s longest serving on-air voices were Carlo Fiorentino, who had been with the station since 1990 and Gregg Nunney who had remained on air since 1996. The station&#x27;s presenters included Liz Jeeves, Tracie Young, Paul Lovett, Mikey Faulkner, Chris Brooks, Gregg &amp; Phil, Murray J, Daniel Fox and Chance Litchfield.

On 1 October 2019 Connect FM&#x27;s FM transmissions were replaced with Smooth, whilst its DAB transmissions were replaced with a non-stop music only service, Radio Up.

Downtown Crossing is also a major bus transfer location serving 13 MBTA bus routes, including one Silver Line route. It is the second busiest subway station in the MBTA network (behind only ), with an average of 24,074 entries per weekday in FY2019.

The Washington Street Tunnel carrying the Main Line (later the Orange Line) opened in 1908, with platforms called Summer and Winter. The Dorchester Tunnel carrying the Cambridge–Dorchester Line (now the Red Line) opened in 1915, with its station called Washington. The MBTA renamed the whole station complex as Washington in 1967, then Downtown Crossing in 1987. Major renovations took place in the 1970s and 1980s. Silver Line service began in 2002.

==Station layout==
Downtown Crossing has two underground platform levels, each with two side platforms. The upper level serves the Orange Line and stretches from Temple Place to Franklin Street under Washington Street. A concourse from Washington Street to Chauncey Street under Summer Street includes entrances to several retail stores and formerly housed the Charliecard Store. The lower-level platforms, under the concourse, serve Red Line trains. The Winter Street Concourse, which connects to the southbound Orange Line platform, allows access to the Green Line at without leaving the common paid area.

Downtown Crossing is a terminal for several MBTA bus routes. routes – – stop on Otis Street at Summer Street, a short block east of the nearest subway entrance. Route stops on Bedford Street at Kingston Street, an additional block to the south. Silver Line route serves Downtown Crossing at a midblock bus stop on Temple Place, half a block from the nearest subway entrance.

===Accessibility===

Like all Orange Line and Red Line stations, Downtown Crossing is accessible. Surface elevators are located at the Winter Street, Franklin Street, and Hawley Street entrances. An additional elevator – open business hours only – leads to the Roche Brothers store which connects to the Summer Street concourse. Because Downtown Crossing is an older station built at two different times in a dense urban area, transfers between the two lines are convoluted. There is no elevator between either of the Red Line platforms and the southbound Orange Line platform; passengers making such transfers must use the Winter Street Concourse and the Red Line elevators at Park Street.

The northbound Red Line platform has elevators at both ends of the Summer Street concourse for connections to the northbound Orange Line and to the street. The southbound Red Line platform only has an elevator at its far east end; passengers transferring to and from the northbound Orange Line must leave fare control at one end of the concourse and reenter at the other end.

A $13.57 million project added the two elevators connecting the northbound Orange Line platform to the northbound Red Line platform. Notice to proceed was given on February 18, 2016; completion was originally expected in late 2017, but delayed until June 14, 2019.

The $50 million Phase II will add an elevator between the northbound Orange Line and southbound Red Line platforms, enlarge and extend the elevator from Winter Street to the southbound Orange Line platform to also serve the southbound Red Line, and relocate the Red Line elevator at Park Street. A $6.9 million design contract was awarded in March 2020. The Phase II improvements, which will complete elevator connections for all transfers, are part of the 2006 settlement of &quot;Joanne Daniels-Finegold, et al. v. MBTA&quot;. Original plans in that settlement for an elevator between the northbound Red Line and southbound Orange Line were found to be infeasible; as part of a 2018 amendment to the settlement, the relocation of the Park Street elevator was substituted. Design was completed for the three elevators by June 2024. , bidding for the project is planned for April 2025, with a construction manager at risk model. Construction is expected to cost $81 million and last nearly three years.
==History==

The Washington Street Tunnel carrying the Main Line Elevated (later the Orange Line) opened on November 30, 1908. Stations on the tunnel were built in pairs with different names and separate entrances, an appeasement to merchants on the street who desired maximal pedestrian traffic. Stations were located at Summer northbound with entrances at Summer Street and Franklin Street, and Winter southbound with entrances at Winter Street and Temple Place. The Dorchester extension of the Cambridge Tunnel (now the Red Line) was built one level below the Washington Street Tunnel. Washington station opened on April 4, 1915, with additional entrances on Summer Street at Hawley Street and Chauncey Street.

As part of a system-wide rebranding by the newly formed MBTA, on January 23, 1967, the Orange Line platforms were renamed Washington as well. On May 3, 1987, the name was changed again to Downtown Crossing after the surrounding retail district, with Washington as a secondary name. The renaming, which had been approved in 1985 as part of a series of station name changes, was coordinated with the opening of the Southwest Corridor. 

The 1970s saw the first major renovations to the station in decades. In 1972, the agency received a federal grant that funded two-thirds of a $14.3 million modernization program for downtown stations, including $2 million for Washington station. As part of that project, the MBTA investigated the feasibility of connecting , , Washington, and with pedestrian tunnels. The stairways between the Summer Street Concourse and the Orange Line platforms were reconfigured.

The Franklin Street entrance was originally inside a building on the north side of the street. The construction of the 350 Washington Street building beginning in 1965 demolished the older building and widened the street. A rebuilt entrance slightly to the north was incorporated into the new building. It was later replaced by a freestanding headhouse, approximately at the original location, in Shopper&#x27;s Park. The MBTA proposed to make the headhouse exit-only during budget cuts in 1981. On August 10, 2015, the entrance was temporarily closed for construction of the Millennium Tower, which constructed a new sloping seating area over the entrance. The renovated headhouse reopened on September 12, 2016.

Originally, the Orange Line level had an underground concourse with several direct access points to basement entrances of various stores in the district, such as Jordan Marsh (now Macy&#x27;s) and the former Filene&#x27;s department store. It was modernized in 1978 with a new fare collection area added. In 1979, the Winter Street Concourse was opened, connecting the upper level of Downtown Crossing station (inside fare control) to the upper level of Park Street station two blocks away, utilizing an existing but previously unopened section of the concourse. Both levels of the station were substantially renovated and accessibility was improved in the mid-1980s. The 101 Arch Street building, completed in 1989, included access to the Summer Street concourse (including an elevator) through its basement level. By 1991, a 1914-installed wooden escalator in the station was the oldest operating escalator in the world.

Modernization in the 1980s included the installation of &quot;Situations&quot;, a set of 31 skewed marble seats designed by Buster Simpson along the Red Line platform. During the renovations, temporary artworks were displayed as part of the Arts on the Line program. One work on the Orange Line level, a take on &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, featured &#x27;alien&#x27; eggs that grew and eventually hatched &#x27;aliens&#x27; portrayed by costumed actors. In August 1987, the MBTA board approved plans for an MBTA Transit Police substation in the Summer Street Concourse. The $950,000 substation opened on July 26, 1988.

Silver Line service from Downtown Crossing to began on July 24, 2002. The Temple Place exit from the southbound Orange Line platform was reopened to allow easier transfers. It was converted to an entrance around 2007 when automated fare collection was installed at the station. On June 24, 2019, the MBTA Board awarded a $29.7 million, 16-month contract for full cleaning, wayfinding signage replacement, and other improvements at North Station, Haymarket, State, and Downtown Crossing stations. The work was completed in June 2021. The entire Orange Line, including the Orange Line platforms at Downtown Crossing station, was closed from August 19 to September 18, 2022, during maintenance work.
===CharlieCard Store===

The MBTA began selling monthly passes in late 1978. A sales office for the passes was opened in the Summer Street concourse outside fare control on December 26, 1978. On August 13, 2012, the MBTA merged reduced-fare ticketing customer services (formerly located in a booth at Back Bay station) and the pass sales counter into a new &quot;CharlieCard Store&quot; at the Downtown Crossing location. The store was located inside an air-conditioned room in the concourse. It provided services including obtaining special passes for blind, senior, disabled, and other users; transferring value between fare media; and conventional pass purchases. Due to unreliable computer systems and high demand, the store initially experienced long wait times. The store was closed on July 17, 2023, due to an air conditioning failure; a temporary location opened on July 27 in the State Transportation Building. The new permanent &quot;Charlie Service Center&quot; opened near State station on July 29, 2024.

<text>The Anaconda Copper Mine was a large copper mine in Butte, Montana that closed operations in 1947 and was eventually consumed by the Berkeley Pit, a vast open-pit mine. Originally a silver mine, it was bought for $30,000 in 1881 by an Irish immigrant named Marcus Daly from Michael Hickey, a Civil War veteran, and co-owner Charles X. Larabie. From this beginning Daly, along with partners George Hearst, James Ben Ali Haggin and Lloyd Tevis, created the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, which ultimately became a global mining enterprise that would go on to mine 18 billion pounds of copper over 100 years. At the height of The Anaconda Copper Mining Company, it consisted of the Anaconda and other Butte mines, a smelter at Anaconda, Montana, processing plants in Great Falls, Montana, the American Brass Company, and many other properties spanning multiple countries. 

The Anaconda Copper Mining Company was acquired by ARCO in 1977.

F. Augustus Heinze, an investor who had come to Montana to capitalize on the mining industry, used the apex theory in several lawsuits to lay claim to ore from the Anaconda Mines. Heinze purchased a small parcel of unclaimed land on top of Butte Hill. In actions upheld by several Butte judges, he was able to take copper ore that was in the Anaconda company&#x27;s shafts. After years of losing lawsuits to Heinze, the company shut down all operations in the state. They put nearly 80% of the state workforce out of work in order to force the state legislature to adopt a &quot;change of venue&quot; provision for lawsuits. Eventually, the company bought out all of Heinze&#x27;s properties and claims.

<doc id="974967" wikidata="Q4580482" url="?curid=974967" title="Equivalent air depth">
<text>The equivalent air depth (EAD) is a way of approximating the decompression requirements of breathing gas mixtures that contain nitrogen and oxygen in different proportions to those in air, known as nitrox.

The equivalent air depth, for a given nitrox mix and depth, is the depth of a dive when breathing air that would have the same partial pressure of nitrogen. So, for example, a gas mix containing 36% oxygen (EAN36) being used at has an EAD of .

==Calculations in metres==
The equivalent air depth can be calculated for depths in metres as follows:

:EAD = (Depth + 10) × (Fraction of N2 / 0.79) − 10

Working the earlier example, for a nitrox mix containing 64% nitrogen (EAN36) being used at 27 metres, the EAD is:

:EAD = (27 + 10) × (0.64 / 0.79) − 10

:EAD = 37 × 0.81 − 10

:EAD = 30 − 10

:EAD = 20 metres

So at 27 metres on this mix, the diver would calculate their decompression requirements as if on air at 20 metres.

==Calculations in feet==
The equivalent air depth can be calculated for depths in feet as follows:

:EAD = (Depth + 33) × (Fraction of N2 / 0.79) − 33

Working the earlier example, for a nitrox mix containing 64% nitrogen (EAN36) being used at 90 feet, the EAD is:

:EAD = (90 + 33) × (0.64 / 0.79) − 33

:EAD = 123 × 0.81 − 33

:EAD = 100 − 33

:EAD = 67 feet

So at 90 feet on this mix, the diver would calculate their decompression requirements as if on air at 67 feet.

==Derivation of the formulas==
For a given nitrox mixture and a given depth, the equivalent air depth expresses the theoretical depth that would produce the same partial pressure of nitrogen if regular air (79% nitrogen) was used instead:
:formula_1

Hence, following the definition of partial pressure:
:formula_2

with formula_3 expressing the fraction of nitrogen and formula_4 expressing the pressure at the given depth. Solving for formula_5 then yields a general formula:
:formula_6

In this formula, formula_7 and formula_8 are absolute pressures. In practice, it is much more convenient to work with the equivalent columns of seawater depth, because the depth can be read off directly from the depth gauge or dive computer. The relationship between pressure and depth is governed by Pascal&#x27;s law:
:formula_9

Using the SI system with pressures expressed in pascal, we have:
:formula_10

Expressing the pressures in atmospheres yields a convenient formula (1 atm ≡ 101325 Pa):
:formula_11

To simplify the algebra we will define formula_12. Combining the general formula and Pascal&#x27;s law, we have:
:formula_13
so that
:formula_14

Since formula_15, the equivalent formula for the imperial system becomes
:formula_16

Substituting R again, and noting that formula_17, we have the concrete formulas:

:formula_18

:formula_19

==Dive tables==
Although not all dive tables are recommended for use in this way, the Bühlmann tables are suitable for use with these kind of calculations. At 27 metres depth the Bühlmann 1986 table (for altitudes of 0–700 m) allows 20 minutes bottom time without requiring a decompression stop, while at 20 metres the no-stop time is 35 minutes. This shows that using EAN36 for a 27-metre dive can give a 75% increase in no-stop bottom time over using air at the same theoretical level of risk of developing symptoms of decompression sickness.

US Navy tables have also been used with equivalent air depth, with similar effect. The calculations are theoretically valid for all Haldanean decompression models.

<text>Black River may refer to several rivers by that name in the province of Ontario, Canada:

*Cochrane District
**the Black River (Abitibi River), a tributary of the Abitibi River
**the Black River (Bodell River), a tributary of the Bodell River, itself a tributary of the Kesagami River.
*The Black River (Hastings County) in Hastings County, which joins the Moira River near Tweed, Ontario.
*The Black River (Kenora District) in Kenora District, Ontario, which flows into the Lake of the Woods
*Simcoe County:
**The Black River in Simcoe County flows south and west from the Haliburton County to the Severn River near Washago, about a mile downstream of the Severn River&#x27;s source at Lake Couchiching. It is a common misconception that the river flows into Lake Couchiching, which is not the case. This was a problem for lumbermen in the 1860s, who established the Rama Timber Transport Company, to move logs from the Black River to Lake Couchiching. This river is now used for recreational canoeing and kayaking. The Head River is a tributary of this river.
**The Black River (Gloucester Pool), flows to Gloucester Pool, further downstream on the same Severn River.
*The Black River (Thunder Bay District) flows from headwaters near Manitouwadge, Ontario to join the Pic River near its mouth on Lake Superior south of the town of Marathon, Ontario. There is a small hydroelectric plant on the river operated by the Pic River First Nation. Because, at one time, there were two competing lumber companies in the area, an elevated timber slide was built to divert one company&#x27;s logs from the Black River over the Pic River, which was used to transport the logs of the other company.
*The Black River (York Region) in the Regional Municipality of York originates in the Oak Ridges Moraine and flows north to Lake Simcoe. Agriculture is the most important use of the land in this river&#x27;s watershed. In the spring, the water levels are high enough to allow pleasant canoeing and kayaking trips from Sutton. Bird viewing is excellent in April. The water flow is calm enough for beginners and families for canoe trips.

<doc id="974970" wikidata="Q5314938" url="?curid=974970" title="Dune FM">
<text>Dune FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving Southport, Sefton and surrounding areas between 1997 and 2012.

== Origins ==
Dune FM originally broadcast two RSL temporary licences in 1993. The first RSL was broadcast from makeshift studios at the rear of the town&#x27;s Floral Hall complex, with the transmitter on the roof of The Southport Theatre. The second broadcast saw the station move to a new base above the Victoria Health &amp; Leisure club, with the transmitter at Greenbank High School in the Hillside area of the town.

The station then broadcast two RSLs as &quot;Magic Dune FM&quot;, with a target area of the town and neighbouring West Lancashire and North Sefton, and a transmitter close to the present site of Aughton near Ormskirk.

The Radio Authority eventually advertised a small-scale local licence for the towns of Southport and Ormskirk and the Merseyside borough of Sefton, which attracted three bids, including the winning Dune FM consortium.

== Full-time licence ==
Dune FM was originally owned by local shareholders, including Steve Dickson, David Maker, Philip Hilton, John Cooper, and the founder of Blackpool&#x27;s Radio Wave, John Barnett. The station found a permanent home at a former substation building on Victoria Way, renamed &quot;The Power Station&quot;.

== Changing hands ==
Dune FM was sold to Forward Media in 1999, backed by venture capital finance and chaired by David Maker, at a time when the station claimed its highest listening figures.

In 2004, the station was bought by The Local Radio Company Plc. who introduced networked programming. In June 2008, Dune FM was bought from TLRC by NIOCOM Limited, and renamed Dune 107.9.

January 2011 saw the station transferred to the ownership of Southport Radio Limited, a group headed by local DJ Jon Jessop and including many of the original group who ran RSL broadcasts under the &#x27;Southport Radio&#x27; moniker. The station relaunched again in February 2011 under the original name of Dune FM.

==Financial problems==
Around the time of the buyout, the station had been suffering from financial problems. In October 2011, High Court enforcement officers acting for multiple creditors removed the station&#x27;s broadcasting equipment from its studios, forcing makeshift facilities to be quickly assembled to get back on-air. During March 2012, a Statutory Demand notice was published in the Southport Champion newspaper, claiming Dune FM Limited owed a significant sum to Proud FM Limited. On Monday 9 July 2012 Dune FM Ltd was wound up in the Liverpool District Registry

==Closure==
Following the winding-up order, the station&#x27;s licence passed into the hands of the official receiver. OFCOM ordered the station to cease broadcasting by 2 August 2012, a deadline which was ignored by Dune&#x27;s owner. Six days after the deadline, OFCOM engineers attended the transmitter site at Gaws Hill, Ormskirk, accompanied by Dune&#x27;s transmission contractor, and removed the transmission equipment. The station went off air at 12.23pm.

The station now exclusively broadcasts online as Coast1079, using the same format and personalities with similar branding.

<doc id="974975" wikidata="Q4868910" url="?curid=974975" title="Bath FM">
<text>Bath FM was a local independent radio station based at the former Weston railway station in Bath, England. The station was launched in November 1999 and closed on 24 March 2010.

The launch event was held in the pub opposite the radio station and it went live at 7.30am on Monday 15th November 1999. Breakfast show presenter Simon Parkin was the first voice heard on air and the first show from the newly installed studios.

The station originally broadcast to an area with a population of 82,000.

==Ownership + The Great Radio Ownership Crisis of 2008-2010==
Bath FM, initially an independent station, was launched in November 1999 as an alternative to GWR FM Bath, which also served the city. The original ownership was mainly in the hands of local businessman Andrew Brownsword.

In February 2006, Bath FM was taken over by The Local Radio Company (TLRC). In June 2008, TLRC sold Bath FM, along with nearby stations Brunel FM and 3TR FM, to Laser Broadcasting. On 28 October 2008, Laser Broadcasting were placed into administration.

On 29 October 2008, it was announced that Bath FM had been sold to South West Radio Ltd. Bath FM was sold alongside Brunel FM, 3TR FM, and two Quaywest stations, following the collapse of previous owner Laser Broadcasting.

South West Radio LTD went into administration on 4 August 2009. The assets and contracts were acquired without liability by YMC ltd who ran the stations as a group.

On 24 March 2010, the five stations were closed by administrators after multiple refusals on the part of regulator OFCOM to transfer the licences, following a number of financial issues at the stations following TLRC&#x27;s sale.

==Technical==
Bath FM&#x27;s signal was broadcast from a transmitter based at Bathampton Down, next to the University of Bath.

In November 2007, Bath FM moved their studios to Swindon, away from their broadcast area, after Ofcom agreed to a request from The Local Radio Company to co-locate Bath FM with Brunel FM.
On 9 September 2008, under Laser Broadcasting, Bath FM moved back into Station House and once again broadcast from the city until its closure. All broadcasting equipment and specialist wiring has now been removed from the premises, a former railway station.

<text>Messier 93 or M93, also known as NGC 2447 or the Critter Cluster, is an open cluster in the modestly southern constellation Puppis, the imagined poop deck of the legendary &quot;Argo&quot;. 

==Observational history and appearance==
It was discovered by Charles Messier then added to his catalogue of comet-like objects in 1781. Caroline Herschel, the younger sister of William Herschel, independently discovered it in 1783, thinking it had not yet been catalogued by Messier. 

Walter Scott Houston (died 1993) described its appearance:
Some observers mention the cluster as having the shape of a starfish. With a fair-sized telescope, this is its appearance on a dull night, but [a four-inch refractor] shows it as a typical star-studded galactic cluster.

==Properties==
It has a Trumpler class of , indicating it is strongly concentrated (I) with a large range in brightness (3) and is rich in stars (r).

M93 is about 3,380 light-years from the solar radius and has a great spatial radius of 10 light-years, a tidal radius of , and a core radius of . Its age is estimated at 387.3 million years. It is nearly on the galactic plane and has an orbit that varies between from the Galactic Center over a period of  Myr.

Fifty-four variable stars have been found in M93, including one slowly pulsating B-type star, one rotating ellipsoidal variable, seven Delta Scuti variables, six Gamma Doradus variables, and one hybrid δ Sct/γ Dor pulsator. Four spectroscopic binary systems within include a yellow straggler component.

<doc id="974983" wikidata="Q813063" url="?curid=974983" title="Beat (King Crimson album)">
<text>Beat is the ninth studio album by the British progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 18 June 1982 by E.G. Records. It was the second King Crimson album to feature the lineup of Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Tony Levin and Bill Bruford, and the first ever King Crimson album to feature the same lineup as its predecessor.

==Background and production==

&quot;Beat&quot; was inspired by the history and writings of the Beat Generation, spurred on by the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of Beat writer Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;On the Road&quot;. Adrian Belew recalls being &quot;prompted by a note saying &#x27;I&#x27;m wheels, I am moving wheels&#x27;&quot; given to him by Robert Fripp, who suggested that Beat writings become the &quot;lyrical underpinning&quot; of the album after he saw Belew reading a work by Kerouac.

Opening track &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; references Kerouac and Neal Cassady. Besides &quot;On the Road&quot;, the lyrics also mention Kerouac&#x27;s novels &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; and &quot;Satori in Paris&quot;. The song was released as a B-side to &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, the album&#x27;s lone single. Musically, &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; picks up where &quot;Discipline&quot; left off, with Fripp and Belew playing patterns in and . &quot;Heartbeat&quot; is also the name of a book written by Cassady&#x27;s wife Carolyn. &quot;Sartori in Tangier&quot; derives its title from &quot;Satori in Paris&quot; and the city of Tangier in Morocco, where a number of Beat writers and Paul Bowles (whose &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; provided the title for a track on &quot;Discipline&quot;) spent time. The instrumental&#x27;s distinctive intro was performed by Tony Levin on the Chapman Stick; the introduction was longer on early live versions.

&quot;Neurotica&quot; shares its title with &quot;Neurotica&quot;, a Beat-era magazine. The song&#x27;s Frippertronics intro is lifted directly from &quot;Hååden Two&quot; from Fripp&#x27;s 1979 solo album &quot;Exposure&quot;. It had been performed live in 1981 as an instrumental titled &quot;Manhattan&quot;. &quot;The Howler&quot; refers to Beat writer Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s 1955 poem &quot;Howl&quot;, which Fripp suggested to Belew as inspiration for the lyrics. The guitar riff heard halfway through the song can be likened to the one Belew played on Tom Tom Club&#x27;s &quot;Genius of Love&quot; in 1981. The song was first performed in early 1982 as an instrumental. Another instrumental track, entitled &quot;Absent Lovers&quot;, was also performed during this time but not included on the album.

The recording of the final track, &quot;Requiem&quot;, created tension between Fripp and Belew. The instrumental was built on a Frippertronics loop from Fripp&#x27;s 1979 solo tour. After Levin and Bruford recorded rhythm tracks, Belew returned to the studio alone to record additional guitar overdubs. Fripp later did the same, though when the group had re-convened, Belew told Fripp to leave the studio in response. Fripp, though visibly upset, complied and headed for his home in Wimborne Minster. He was not heard from for several days, though a letter from Bruford and a phone call from manager Paddy Spinks led the group to &quot;piece it all back together&quot; and Belew would later apologise. However, the group did not reconvene until the beginning of their subsequent tour.

Fripp recalled that &quot;at the time, Bill and Adrian thought that &quot;Beat&quot; was better than &quot;Discipline&quot;. For me, this [was] an indication of how far the band had already drifted from its original vision. The group broke up at the end of [the sessions]...I had nothing to do with the mixing of &quot;Beat&quot;, nor did I feel able to promote it. Somehow we absorbed that fact, and kept going.&quot; Belew considered the sessions &quot;the most awful record-making experience of [his] life and one [he] would never choose to repeat&quot;, and both he and Bruford have stated in retrospect that &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Two Hands&quot; should not have been included on the album.

== Release and reception ==
Released on 18 June 1982, &quot;Beat&quot; peaked at number 39 in the UK Albums Chart. In a positive review, &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the players push their instruments into a new form, akin to fusion and art-rock, but miles beyond either, and beyond description as well.&quot;

A 5.1 surround sound mix of the album by Fripp and Steven Wilson, started in 2009 and finished in 2013, was released in October 2016 for King Crimson&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Series as a standalone CD/DVD package and as part of the &quot;On (and off) The Road (1981–1984)&quot; box set.

<doc id="974987" wikidata="Q66057506" url="?curid=974987" title="Nothing Else Matters">
<text>&quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; is a power ballad by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, &quot;Metallica&quot;. The song peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, number 6 on the UK Singles Chart, number 1 in Denmark, and reached the top ten on many other European charts. Recognized as one of Metallica&#x27;s best known and most popular songs, it has become a staple in live performances.

==History==
Lead singer and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield wrote the song (credited to Hetfield/Ulrich) in 1990 while on tour, when Hetfield &quot;was bumming out about being away from home.&quot; Initially, the song was not meant to be released, as Hetfield had written it for himself, but after drummer Lars Ulrich heard it, it was considered for the album. Hetfield initially had reservations about presenting the song to the band: &quot;I thought that Metallica could only be the four of us. These are songs about destroying things, head banging, bleeding for the crowd, whatever it is, as long as it wasn&#x27;t about chicks and fast cars, even though that&#x27;s what we liked. The song was about a girlfriend at the time. It turned out to be a pretty big song.&quot; It was one of four demo songs recorded by the band on August 13, 1990.

==Composition==
Its intro is an E minor arpeggio (transposed one half-step lower on stage performances) beginning with the open low E followed by the open G, B and high E strings.

It is one of the few Metallica songs in which Hetfield plays the guitar solo. Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett does not play on the studio recording, making it one of the few in the whole Metallica repertoire, along with Cliff Burton&#x27;s &quot;(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth&quot;, in which he does not appear. Hammett stated he did not learn how to play the song until they were well into the tour for the album.

The orchestral arrangements were written by award-winning composer Michael Kamen.

==Music video==
The music video premiered on MTV on February 26, 1992. It was directed by Adam Dubin and edited by Sean Fullan. The clip consists of parts of the &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot; documentary, which was shot during the recordings of &quot;Metallica&quot;. One of them shows Hetfield playing a Gibson EDS-1275 guitar during the second chorus. MTV will not air the video during daytime hours anymore because it features nudity in the form of pin-up posters and &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfolds that are taped up in the studio. It also has a picture of Winger&#x27;s Kip Winger which Ulrich is seen throwing darts at. On the band&#x27;s 2006 music video compilation DVD, the posters are censored, as was done with the nudity featured in the music videos for &quot;Turn the Page&quot; and &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;.

In August 2021, the music video hit one billion views on YouTube, making it Metallica&#x27;s first music video to do so.

==Live==
The song has become a staple in Metallica&#x27;s live performances, and has been dedicated to their fans. 

A live version in which this can be heard can be found on the CD/DVD &quot;Orgullo, Pasión y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de México&quot;. Other live recordings can be found on &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot;, on &quot;S&amp;M&quot;, &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot; DVD, the DVD/Blu-ray &quot;The Big 4 Live from Sofia, Bulgaria&quot; as well as on the soundtrack for the band&#x27;s feature film &quot;Through the Never&quot;, and also featured on 2019 &quot;S&amp;M&quot; follow-up live album, &quot;S&amp;M2&quot;.

<doc id="974990" wikidata="Q78528" url="?curid=974990" title="Franz Schreker">
<text>Franz Schreker (originally &quot;Schrecker&quot;; 23 March 1878 – 21 March 1934) was an Austrian composer, conductor, librettist, teacher and administrator. Primarily a composer of operas, Schreker developed a style characterized by aesthetic plurality (a mixture of Romanticism, Naturalism, Symbolism, Impressionism, Expressionism and Neue Sachlichkeit), timbral experimentation, strategies of extended tonality and conception of total music theatre into the narrative of 20th-century music.

==Formative years==
He was born as Franz Schrecker in Monaco, the eldest son of the Bohemian Jewish court photographer Ignaz Franz Schrekker (Germanized from &quot;Ignácz Furencz&quot;, originally &quot;Isak&quot;), and his wife, Eleonore von Cloßmann, who was a member of the Catholic aristocracy of Styria. He grew up during travels across half of Europe and, after the early death of his father, the family moved from Linz to Vienna (1888) where in 1892, with the help of a scholarship, Schreker entered the Vienna Conservatory. Starting with violin studies, with Sigismund Bachrich and Arnold Rosé, he moved into the composition class of Robert Fuchs, graduating as a composer in 1900. His first success was with the Intermezzo for strings, Op. 8, which won an important prize sponsored by the &quot;Neue musikalische Presse&quot; in 1901. His first opera, &quot;Flammen&quot;, was completed in 1902 but failed to receive a staged production.

==Career launch==
Schreker had begun conducting in 1895, when he had founded the Verein der Musikfreunde Döbling. In 1907 he formed the Vienna Philharmonic Chorus, which he conducted until 1920: among its many premières were Zemlinsky&#x27;s &quot;Psalm XXIII&quot; and Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Friede auf Erden&quot; and &quot;Gurre-Lieder.&quot; Schreker and other composers, such as Schoenberg and Zemlinsky, were influential during the Jugendstil movement, which incorporated non-western styles inspired by Ancient Egypt and the Far East.

His &quot;pantomime&quot;, &quot;Der Geburtstag der Infantin&quot;, commissioned by the dancer Grete Wiesenthal and her sister Elsa for the opening of the 1908 Kunstschau, first called attention to his development as a composer. Such was the success of the venture that Schreker composed several more dance-related works for the two sisters including &quot;Der Wind&quot;, &quot;Valse lente&quot; and &quot;Ein Tanzspiel (Rokoko)&quot;.

==Success in opera==
November 1909 saw the stormy premiere of the complex orchestral interlude (entitled &quot;Nachtstück&quot;) from &quot;Der ferne Klang&quot;, the opera he had been working on since 1903. In 1912, the first performance of the complete opera by Oper Frankfurt consolidated his fame. In the same year, director Wihelm Bopp offered Schreker a provisional teaching appointment at the Conservatory where Schreker had studied, now the Vienna Music Academy. In early 1913 he was appointed full professor. Schreker wrote his own libretti for all of his mature operas.

This breakthrough heralds a decade of great success for the composer. His next opera, &quot;Das Spielwerk und die Prinzessin&quot;, which was given simultaneous premières in Frankfurt and Vienna on 15 March 1913 was less well received (the work was subsequently revised as a one-act &#x27;Mysterium&#x27; entitled simply &quot;Das Spielwerk&quot; in 1915), but the scandal caused by this opera in Vienna only served to make Schreker&#x27;s name more widely known.
The outbreak of World War I interrupted the composer&#x27;s success but with the première of his opera &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot;, in Frankfurt on 25 April 1918, Schreker moved to the front ranks of contemporary opera composers. The first performance of &quot;Der Schatzgräber&quot; in Frankfurt on 21 January 1920 was the high point of his career. The &quot;Chamber Symphony&quot;, composed between the two operas for the faculty of the Vienna Academy in 1916, quickly entered the repertoire and remains Schreker&#x27;s most frequently performed work today.

In March 1920 he was appointed director of the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin and between 1920 and 1932 he gave extensive musical tuition in a variety of subjects with Berthold Goldschmidt, Alois Hába, Jascha Horenstein, Julius Bürger, Ernst Krenek, Artur Rodziński, Stefan Wolpe, Zdenka Ticharich and Grete von Zieritz numbering among his students.

==End of career==
Schreker&#x27;s fame and influence were at their peak during the early years of the Weimar Republic when he was the most performed living opera composer after Richard Strauss. The decline of his artistic fortunes began with the mixed reception given to &quot;Irrelohe&quot; at the Cologne Opera in 1924 under Otto Klemperer and the failure of &quot;Der singende Teufel&quot;, given in Berlin in 1928 under Erich Kleiber.

Political developments and the spread of antisemitism were also contributory factors, both of which heralded the end of Schreker&#x27;s career. Right-wing demonstrations marred the première of &quot;Der Schmied von Gent&quot; in Berlin in 1932 and National Socialist pressure forced the cancellation of the scheduled Freiburg première of &quot;Christophorus&quot; in 1933 (the work was finally performed there in 1978). Finally, in June 1932, Schreker lost his position as Director of the Musikhochschule in Berlin and, the following year, also his post as professor of composition at the Akademie der Künste.

In his lifetime he went from being hailed as the future of German opera to being considered irrelevant as a composer and marginalized as an educator. After suffering from a stroke in December 1933, he died in Berlin on 21 March 1934, two days before his 56th birthday.

Although Schreker was influenced by composers such as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner, his mature style shows a highly individual harmonic language, which, although broadly tonal, is inflected with chromatic and polytonal passages. Schreker also took musical inspiration from his close friend Arnold Schoenberg with the use of expressionist style.

The Third Reich banned Schreker&#x27;s music along with that of many other composers of Jewish origin. His early death in 1934 at the age of 55, together with the Nazi ban, prevented Schreker&#x27;s music from expanding outside of German-speaking Europe.

==Reputation today==
After decades in obscurity, Schreker has begun to enjoy a considerable revival in reputation in the German-speaking world and in the United States. In 2005 the Salzburg Festival mounted an incomplete production of &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot;, conducted by Kent Nagano (and filmed), and the Jewish Museum in Vienna presented an exhibition devoted to his life and work. New productions of &quot;Der ferne Klang&quot; were staged at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin and the Zurich Opera in 2010, as well as in smaller opera houses in Germany. &quot;Irrelohe&quot; was performed at the Volksoper in Vienna in 2004, at the Bonn Opera in November 2010 then staged for the first time in France at the Opéra National de Lyon in March 2022. In 2010 a Schreker opera was staged in the US for the first time: &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot; at Los Angeles Opera; and months after that came a second: &quot;Der ferne Klang&quot; during the Bard Summerscape Festival. Australian composer, pianist, and conductor David Stanhope included Scheker&#x27;s &quot;Prelude to a Drama&quot; in his recording Tall Poppies TP274 &quot;David Stanhope live in concert with Sydney Symphony Orchestra&quot;: Franz Schreker &quot;Prelude to a Drama&quot;, and Rachmaninoff &quot;Symphonic Dances&quot;.

<text>Edward Patrick Boland (October 1, 1911 – November 4, 2001) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. A Democrat, he was a representative from Massachusetts&#x27;s 2nd congressional district.

==Early life and education==
Boland&#x27;s father was an Irish immigrant railroad worker. Boland was born in Springfield, Massachusetts and graduated from Springfield Central High School in 1928. He attended Bay Path Institute and Boston College Law School.

==Military service==
He served in the United States Army during World War II.

==Political career==

He was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1939 to 1940 and was the Hampden County register of deeds from 1941 to 1952.

Boland was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1952. Congressman Boland was in office during the closing of the Springfield Armory in 1968, and was harshly criticized for his inability to prevent its closure. This failure resulted in a challenge to Boland in 1968 by Springfield Mayor Charles V. Ryan. Boland was re-elected handily with significant help from the family of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy in what was to be the last challenge to Boland by a major contender. Boland&#x27;s most famous work as a congressman was the 1982 Boland Amendment, which blocked certain funding of the Contras in Nicaragua after the Central Intelligence Agency had supervised acts of sabotage without notifying Congress. Boland lived in a Washington apartment with fellow Massachusetts Congressman Tip O&#x27;Neill (whose wife remained in Massachusetts) until 1977.

Boland announced in April 1988 that he would not run for a 19th term later that year; he never lost an election in 50 years as an elected official. Earlier, he&#x27;d tipped off Springfield mayor Richard Neal about his pending retirement, allowing Neal to get a significant head start in fundraising. Neal would be unopposed for the Democratic nomination–the real contest in this heavily Democratic district–and has held this seat, now numbered as the 1st district, ever since.

==Personal life &amp; death==
Boland married at the age of 62, fathering four children. Boland died in 2001 at the age of 90 from natural causes.

<text>Trax FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving Doncaster in South Yorkshire and the Bassetlaw district of north Nottinghamshire. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
The station started as two separate licences, one for Doncaster and one for Bassetlaw. Previously the station had operated two &quot;RSL&quot; 28-day broadcasts.

In 2020, Trax FM, along with the other Lincs FM Group stations, were sold to Bauer Media and the station was rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio in September 2020, as part of their national Greatest Hits Radio network. It now broadcasts national and regional music programmes with local news bulletins.

==Transmitters==
The service for Doncaster broadcasts on 107.1FM previously from the studios on White Rose Way in Doncaster. The signal is broadcast from the Clifton transmitter, near Conisbrough, South Yorkshire. That signal is five times more powerful than the former Worksop transmitter. In 2015, transmissions moved to an antenna on Silverwood House in the centre of Doncaster.

The service for Bassetlaw is on 107.9FM used to come from the studios on Bridge Street in Worksop. The signal was transmitted from the Worksop transmitter, north of Worksop in Bassetlaw next to the B6045 towards Blyth, north Nottinghamshire. In 2016, transmissions moved to a transmitter at Worksop Golf Course to the south of the town. The transmitter provides coverage to Worksop town and rural areas to the west of Retford.

Trax FM was also broadcast across South Yorkshire and the North Midlands on DAB Digital Radio on the Bauer South Yorkshire (former EMAP South Yorkshire) multiplex and on the Internet. Trax FM on DAB and the Internet carried the Doncaster variation of the station.

==Background==
Trax FM co-located the Bassetlaw service to Doncaster in 2007, despite the original 107.9 station ownership being crucial in getting the more lucrative Doncaster licence. The format change includes a reduction in the hours of local broadcasting from seven hours to four hours.

<text>Messier 105 or M105, also known as NGC 3379, is an elliptical galaxy 36.6 million light-years away in the equatorial constellation of Leo. It is the biggest elliptical galaxy in the Messier catalogue that is not in the Virgo cluster. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781, just a few days after he discovered the nearby galaxies Messier 95 and Messier 96. This galaxy is one of a few not object-verified by Messier so omitted in the editions of his Catalogue of his era. It was appended when Helen S. Hogg found a letter by Méchain locating and describing this object which matched those aspects under its first-published name, NGC 3379.

It has a morphological classification of E1, indicating a standard elliptical galaxy with a flattening of 10%. The major axis is aligned along a position angle of 71°. Isophotes of the galaxy are near perfect ellipses, twisting no more than 5° out of alignment, with changes in ellipticity of no more than 0.06. There is no fine structure apparent in the isophotes, such as ripples. Observation of giant stars in the halo indicate there are two general populations: a dominant metal-rich subpopulation and a weaker metal-poor group.

Messier 105 is known to have a supermassive black hole at its core whose mass is estimated to be between and . The galaxy has a weak active galactic nucleus of the LINER type with a spectral class of L2/T2, meaning no broad Hα line and intermediate emission line ratios between a LINER and a H II region. The galaxy also contains a few young stars and stellar clusters, suggesting some elliptical galaxies still form new stars, but very slowly.

This galaxy, along with its companion the barred lenticular galaxy NGC 3384, is surrounded by an enormous ring of neutral hydrogen with a radius of and a mass of where star formation has been detected. Messier 105 is one of several galaxies within the M96 Group (also known as the Leo I Group), a group of galaxies in the constellation Leo, the other Messier objects of which are M95 and M96. It is one of the richest group of galaxies in the Local Volume, and unlike the Local Group, it is dominated by not one but several galaxies.

<doc id="975019" wikidata="Q1750385" url="?curid=975019" title="Swing Low, Sweet Chariot">
<text>&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; is an African-American spiritual song and one of the best-known Christian hymns. Originating in early African-American musical traditions, the song was probably composed in the late 1860s by Wallace Willis and his daughter Minerva Willis, both Choctaw freedmen. Performances by the Hampton Singers and the Fisk Jubilee Singers brought the song to the attention of wider audiences in the late 19th century. The earliest known recording of &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; was recorded in 1894, by the Standard Quartette.

The song uses the theme of death to remind the audience of the glory that awaits in Heaven, when Christians believe they will transcend the earthly world of suffering and come to rest in their final home. Specifically, the text refers to the Old Testament account of the Prophet Elijah&#x27;s ascent into Heaven by chariot. The stylistic elements and thematic content are highly typical to those of other spirituals. The song is characterized by its use of repetition as a key poetic element, powerful imagery, personal rhetoric, and potentially coded lyrics. &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; was traditionally performed as a call-and response tune. Its free-form structure intentionally allows for improvisation and spur-of-the-moment changes made to bring the performers and audience to a state of ecstasy and connection with the Holy Spirit. The melody is pentatonic.

In 2002, the US Library of Congress honored the song as one of 50 recordings chosen that year to be added to the National Recording Registry. It was also included in the list of &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;, by the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.

==History==
&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; was composed by Wallace Willis and Minerva Willis, Choctaw freedmen in the old Indian Territory in what is now Choctaw County, near the County seat of Hugo, Oklahoma, sometime after 1865. He may have been inspired by the sight of the Red River, by which he was toiling, which reminded him of the Jordan River and of the Prophet Elijah being taken to heaven by a chariot (2 Kings 2:11). Some sources claim that this song and &quot;Steal Away&quot; (also sung by Willis) had lyrics that referred to the Underground Railroad, the freedom movement that helped black people escape from Southern slavery to the North and Canada.

Alexander Reid, a minister at the Old Spencer Academy, a Choctaw boarding school, heard Willis singing these two songs and transcribed the words and melodies. He sent the music to the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Jubilee Singers popularized the songs during a tour of the United States and Europe.

In 1939, Nazi Germany&#x27;s Reich Music Examination Office added the song to a listing of &quot;undesired and harmful&quot; musical works.

The song enjoyed a resurgence during the 1960s Civil Rights struggle and the folk revival; it was performed by a number of artists. Perhaps the most famous performance during this period was that by Joan Baez during the legendary 1969 Woodstock festival.

Oklahoma State Senator Judy Eason McIntyre from Tulsa proposed a bill nominating &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; as the Oklahoma State official gospel song in 2011. The bill was co-sponsored by the Oklahoma State Black Congressional Caucus. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed the bill into law on May 5, 2011, at a ceremony at the Oklahoma Cowboy Hall of Fame; making the song the official Oklahoma State Gospel Song.

== Lyrics ==

&lt;poem&gt;
Refrain:
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Coming for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see,
Coming for to carry me home.
I saw a band of angels coming after me,
Coming for to carry me home.

[Refrain]

If you get back to heaven before I do,
Coming for to carry me home.
You&#x27;ll tell all your friends I&#x27;ll be coming there too,
Coming for to carry me home.

[Refrain]

&lt;/poem&gt;
As is typical of folk songs, there is no standardized set of lyrics. The version by the Fisk Jubilee Singers takes the following structure:
&lt;poem&gt;
Refrain:
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

[Refrain]

I&#x27;m sometimes up, I&#x27;m sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Coming for to carry me home

[Refrain]

I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

[Refrain]

[Refrain]
&lt;/poem&gt;
== Content and style ==
The content of the song is typical to the style of the spiritual in several ways: its use of imagery that provides a sense of immediacy to the historical and biblical past, the repetition of the key poetic element of the song (“Coming for to carry me home”), and the alteration between the refrain and the stanzas throughout.  The song alternates between first person and second person pronouns, stressing the relationship between the performer, the listener, and the events unfolding in the song. By directly calling to the listener in the second stanza (“If you get there before I do”) the audience is transformed into a creative device that serves to heighten the emotional urgency of the tune.

The song was originally intended to be sung in a call-and-response, a format that draws from the heritage of African styles of music and is widely used in African-American churches today. A leader sings the differentiated lines, and the congregation replies “Coming for to carry me home” after each. This style of performing the spiritual can be heard in the existing recordings of the Fisk Jubilee Singers performing the tune. This call-and-response performance style is the most common form of spiritual.

The simple, repetitive nature of the song, along with the fact that it was commonly performed without instrumental accompaniment, meant that spontaneous shifts in tempo, pitch, and emphasis were commonly made, leading the song in new and exciting directions intended to unify congregants with the Holy Spirit.

Like other spirituals, “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” has been thought to contain coded meanings not immediately apparent to all listeners. American historian Charshee Charlotte Lawrence McIntyre argues that many spirituals make use of “metonymic devices,” or metaphors that have encoded meanings. She claims that throughout many traditional spirituals several recurring figures always carry a metonymic double meaning. These double meanings allowed enslaved people to safely communicate messages of hope, freedom, and specific plans for escape to one another under the watchful gaze of their captors. The double meanings encoded in “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” are believed to be the Jordan River as representative of the first step to freedom from slavery, “home” as Africa, and Jesus as anyone who helps bring the enslaved to freedom. However, a definitive categorization of any such figures is impossible to make.

==Renditions==
A popular early recording was by the Fisk University Jubilee Quartet for Victor Records (No. 16453) on December 1, 1909, which became the first gospel song to sell 1 million copies and is one of the best-selling gospel songs of all time. Two years later the Apollo Jubilee Quartette recorded the song on Monday, February 26, 1912, Columbia Records (A1169), New York City.

Since then, numerous versions have been recorded; including those by Nellie Melba (one of her last recordings, made in June 1926), Bing Crosby (recorded April 25, 1938), Kenny Ball and His Jazzmen (included in the album &quot;The Kenny Ball Show&quot; – 1962), Louis Armstrong (for his album &quot;Louis and the Good Book&quot; – 1958), Sam Cooke (for his album &quot;Swing Low&quot; – 1961), Vince Hill (1993), Peggy Lee (1946), and Paul Robeson (recorded January 7, 1926 for Victor (No. 20068)). In 1951, Dizzy Gillespie replaced the chariot with a Cadillac; first a Fleetwood and later, as on the 1967 album &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Cadillac&quot;, an Eldorado.

===Biviano Accordion Sextette===
The jazz accordionist/composer John Serry Sr. recorded the composition with the jazz guitarist Tony Mottola
as members of the Biviano Accordion &amp; Rhythm Sextette in 1947 for Sonora Records on the album &quot;Accordion Capers&quot; (Sonora # MS 476).

&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; contains the lyrics, &quot;I looked over Jordan and what did I see? Coming for to carry me home&quot;. Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 song &quot;Sheep&quot;, written by Roger Waters, makes reference to the song with the lyrics, &quot;I&#x27;ve looked over Jordan and I have seen, things are not what they seem&quot;. A later 1992 song by Waters, &quot;The Bravery of Being Out of Range&quot;, makes further reference to the song with the lyrics, &quot;I looked over Jordan and what did I see? I saw a U.S. Marine in a pile of debris&quot;.

==Use in rugby union==
&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; has been sung by English rugby players and fans for some decades, and there are associated gestures, sometimes used in a drinking game, which requires those who wrongly perform the gestures to buy a round of drinks. Folk singer Joe Stead claimed he introduced it to the rugby fraternity as early as 1960 after hearing it from civil rights activist Paul Robeson. An article published in &quot;Tatler&quot; in 1966 described a &quot;tradition&quot; at the West Park bar at Twickenham of patrons singing the song whilst swaying as one, shoulder-to-shoulder. It became associated with the England national side, in particular, in 1988.

=== First documented singing at Twickenham (1987) ===
The World Rugby Museum in 2020 unearthed archive footage of &quot;Swing Low&quot; being sung at Twickenham when Martin Offiah (nicknamed &quot;Chariots&quot; as a play-on-words referencing the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;), played in the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. The curator of the museum believes the crowd at Twickenham would already have known &quot;Swing Low&quot; because it had been sung in rugby clubs since the 1960s, with rude gestures illustrating the words.

=== First documented singing at an England international match (1988) ===
Coming into the last match of the 1988 season, against Ireland at Twickenham, England had lost 15 of their previous 23 matches in the Five Nations Championship. The Twickenham crowd had only seen one solitary England try in the previous two years and at half time against Ireland they were 0–3 down. However, during the second half England scored six tries to give them a 35–3 win. The official account of this occasion from the Rugby Football Union is that a group of fans from Market Bosworth rugby club in the West Stand started singing the song before it was taken up by the rest of the crowd. Another account states that a group of boys from Douai School were the ones in the crowd to begin singing the song before it was taken up by other fans. The song is still regularly sung at matches by English supporters.

=== 2020 review ===
In 2020 the Rugby Football Union, in response to the increased interest in the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd, said it was &quot;reviewing&quot; fans&#x27; use of the song. Former rugby player Brian Moore and Prince Harry both argued that the song should no longer be sung in rugby contexts. Former Barbarian and Rugby League Hall of Fame player Martin Offiah shortly afterwards said that he thought the song should be retained as an opportunity to educate England&#x27;s and other nationalities&#x27; rugby fans about racial discrimination and Black history. Former England player Maggie Alphonsi said &quot;I think it&#x27;s good the RFU are having a review, but I don&#x27;t agree with it being banned&quot;.

<text>Messier 106 (also known as NGC 4258) is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781. M106 is at a distance of about 22 to 25 million light-years away from Earth. M106 contains an active nucleus classified as a Type 2 Seyfert, and the presence of a central supermassive black hole has been demonstrated from radio-wavelength observations of the rotation of a disk of molecular gas orbiting within the inner light-year around the black hole. NGC 4217 is a possible companion galaxy of Messier 106. Besides the two visible arms, it has two &quot;anomalous arms&quot; detectable using an X-ray telescope.

==Characteristics==
M106 has a water vapor megamaser (the equivalent of a laser operating in microwave instead of visible light and on a galactic scale) that is seen by the 22-GHz line of ortho-H2O that evidences dense and warm molecular gas. Water masers are useful for observing nuclear accretion disks in active galaxies. The water masers in M106 enabled the first case of a direct measurement of the distance to a galaxy, thereby providing an independent anchor for the cosmic distance ladder. M106 has a slightly warped, thin, almost edge-on Keplerian disc which is on a subparsec scale. It surrounds a central area with mass .

It is one of the largest and brightest nearby galaxies, similar in size and luminosity to the Andromeda Galaxy. The supermassive black hole at the core has a mass of .

M106 has also played an important role in calibrating the cosmic distance ladder. Before, Cepheid variables from other galaxies could not be used to measure distances since they cover ranges of metallicities different from the Milky Way&#x27;s. M106 contains Cepheid variables similar to both the metallicities of the Milky Way and other galaxies&#x27; Cepheids. By measuring the distance of the Cepheids with metallicities similar to our galaxy, astronomers are able to recalibrate the other Cepheids with different metallicities, a key fundamental step in improving quantification of distances to other galaxies in the universe.

==Supernovae==
Two supernovae have been observed in M106:
* SN 1981K (type II, mag. 17) was reported by E. Hummel and verified by Paul Wild by examining archival photos dated 3 November 1981.
* SN 2014bc (type II, mag. 14.8) was discovered by the PS1 Science Consortium 3Pi survey on 19 May 2014.

<doc id="975026" wikidata="Q1892019" url="?curid=975026" title="Māori music">
<text>Traditional Māori music, or pūoro Māori, is composed or performed by Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, and includes a wide variety of folk music styles, often integrated with poetry and dance.

In addition to these traditions and musical heritage, since the 19th-century European colonisation of New Zealand, Māori musicians and performers have adopted and interpreted many of the imported Western musical styles. Contemporary rock and roll, soul, reggae, and hip hop all feature a variety of notable Māori performers.

==Traditional forms==
===Waiata===
Songs (&quot;waiata&quot;) are sung solo, in unison, or at the octave. Types of songs include lullabies (&quot;oriori&quot;), love songs (&quot;waiata aroha&quot;), and laments (&quot;waiata tangi&quot;). Traditionally all formal speeches are followed by a waiata sung by the speaker and their group of supporters. Some of the smaller wind instruments are also sung into, and the sound of the &quot;poi&quot; (raupō ball swung on the end of a flax cord) provides a rhythmic accompaniment to &quot;waiata poi&quot;.

===Mōteatea===
Captain Cook, who visited the New Zealand archipelago in the late-18th century, reported that the Māori sang a song in &quot;semitones&quot;. Others reported that the Māori had no vocal music at all, or sang discordantly. In fact, the ancient chants, or mōteatea, to which Cook was referring, are microtonal and repeat a single melodic line, generally centred on one note, falling away at the end of the last line. It was a bad omen for a song to be interrupted, so singers would perform in subgroups to allow each subgroup to breathe without interrupting the flow of the chant. Mervyn McLean, in &quot;Traditional Songs of the Maori&quot;, first notated the microtonality in a significant number of mōteatea in 1975.

&quot;Ngā Mōteatea&quot;,
collected by Sir Āpirana Ngata (1874-1950), is an important collection of traditional song lyrics.

=== Karanga ===

A karanga is a formal, ceremonial call and response at the start of a pōwhiri (welcome ceremony) and is common on a marae. Karanga are carried out almost exclusively by women and in the Māori language. It is a special role and there are guidelines around who is best placed to carry out the karanga that are dependent on the protocols of each pōwhiri. Woman performing the call are called kaikaranga, the call comes from the host group and also from the visitor group, a name for the person from the visitor group is also kaiwhakautu. Skilled kaikaranga encapsulate important information about the group and the purpose of the visit.
=== Taonga pūoro (traditional Māori musical instruments) ===

There is a rich tradition of wind, percussion and whirled instruments known by the collective term taonga pūoro. The work of researchers and enthusiasts such as Richard Nunns, Hirini Melbourne and Brian Flintoff has provided a wealth of knowledge and information around the sounds, history and stories of these instruments, which included various types of flutes, wooden trumpets, percussion instruments and bull-roarers.

===Revival of traditional music===
As part of a deliberate campaign to revive Māori music and culture in the early 20th century, Āpirana Ngata invented the &quot;action song&quot; (&quot;waiata-a-ringa&quot;) in which stylised body movements, many with standardised meanings, synchronise with the singing. He, Tuini Ngāwai and the tourist concert parties of Rotorua developed the familiar performance of today, with sung entrance, poi, haka (&quot;war dance&quot;), stick game, hymn, ancient song and/or action song, and sung exit. The group that performs it is known as a &quot;kapa haka&quot;, and in the last few decades, competitions within &quot;iwi&quot; (tribes) and religious denominations regionally and nationally, have raised their performances to a high standard.

In 1964, The Polynesian Festival (which became the Aotearoa Traditional Māori Performing Arts Festival and is now known as Te Matatini), was founded with the express purpose of encouraging the development of Māori music.

==Contemporary Māori music==
While the guitar has become an almost universal instrument to accompany Maori performances today, this only dates from the mid 20th century. Earlier performers used the piano or violin. Tours of travelling Hawaiian musicians like Ernest Kaʻai and David Luela Kaili to New Zealand in the 1900s to 1920s introduced the Māori to steel guitars and the &quot;ukulele&quot; which were readily adopted with innovations from their own sonoral traditions. Some modern artists such as Hinewehi Mohi, Tiki Taane, Maisey Rika and Taisha Tari have revived the use of traditional instruments.

Ngata and Tuini Ngawai composed many songs using European tunes, to encourage Māori pride and, from 1939, to raise morale among Māori at home and at the war. Many, such as &quot;&quot;Hoki mai e tama mā&quot; and &quot;E te Hokowhiti-a-Tū&quot;&quot; (to the tune of &quot;In the Mood&quot;) are still sung today. More recently, other styles originating overseas, including jazz, swing and rock have been incorporated. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hirini Melbourne composed prolifically in an adapted form of traditional style (His &quot;Tīhore mai te rangi&quot; seldom ranges outside a major third, and &quot;Ngā iwi e&quot; outside a fourth) and groups like Herbs created a Māori style of reggae. Traditional heavy metal is prevalent in Māori societies today with the heavy guitar usage similar to Blues Rock style of string picking. One example of &quot;Te Reo Metal&quot; is the Thrash metal band, Alien Weaponry.

By the 1970s, Māori music had become a very minor part of New Zealand broadcasting. In 1973, only 15 minutes of Māori music was played on New Zealand airways per week. In the 1980s, a number of sungs sung in te Reo became hits in New Zealand, including &quot;The Bridge&quot; (1981) by Deane Waretini, &quot;Maoris on 45&quot; (1982) by the Consorts and &quot;E Ipo&quot; (1982) by Prince Tui Teka. The largest of these was &quot;Poi E&quot; performed by the Pātea Māori Club, which became the top single of 1984.

After the 1986 Te Reo Māori claim at the Waitangi Tribunal (Wai 11), which argued that Māori language was a taonga (treasure) that the New Zealand Government was obliged to protect, Māori music and Māori language broadcasting became used as a means to promote Māori language and culture. In the 1980s and 1990s, local iwi radio stations were established in New Zealand, and in 1990 the government reserved radio frequencies specifically for the promotion of Māori language and culture. These stations included Radio Waatea, Radio Tainui, Tahu FM and Mai FM (which was later sold to MediaWorks as a commercial urban contemporary radio station). Two government agencies began to fund Māori music: NZ On Air and Te Māngai Pāho. In the 1990s, musicians such as Moana and the Moahunters, Southside of Bombay and Hinewehi Mohi (&quot;Kotahitanga&quot;) released high profile songs that were sung in or included Te Reo Māori lyrics. Many Māori musical acts since the 1980s have been influenced by African-American music genres and reggae.

From 1998 until 2010, NZ On Air produced compilation albums of Māori music for radio stations, entitled &quot;Iwi Hit Disc&quot;, in a similar vein to the organisation&#x27;s &quot;Kiwi Hit Disc&quot; series. These albums were intended to showcase Māori music which had potential crossover potential to other radio formats. During this time period, very few songs sung in Māori had major success. In 2014, as a challenge to repeat the success of &quot;Poi E&quot;, musicians Stan Walker, Ria Hall, Troy Kingi and Maisey Rika released the song &quot;Aotearoa&quot; for te Wiki o te Reo Māori. The song reached number two on the New Zealand singles chart.

In 2019, to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1999 Rugby World Cup semi-final where Hinewehi Mohi performed the national anthem in te reo, Mohi created &quot;Waiata / Anthems&quot;, an album where 11 New Zealand musicians re-recorded songs into te reo Māori, including Six60, Stan Walker, Benee, Drax Project and Bic Runga. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number 1 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, and became one of the most successful albums of 2019 in New Zealand. Due to the success of the project, &quot;Waiata / Anthems&quot; became an annual project, where original songs and songs re-recorded in te reo Māori would be released, coinciding with Te Wiki o te Reo Māori. Some of the most successful songs from 2021 included &quot;35&quot; by Ka Hao featuring Rob Ruha, and &quot;Pepeha&quot; by Six60. In mid-2021, Recorded Music NZ began publishing a chart of the top songs sung in Te Reo Māori in New Zealand.

===Māori show bands===
Māori show bands formed in New Zealand and Australia from the 1950s. The groups performed in a wide variety of musical genres, dance styles, and with cabaret skills, infusing their acts with comedy drawn straight from Māori culture. Some Māori show bands would begin their performances in traditional Māori costume before changing into suits and sequinned gowns. Billy T. James spent many years overseas in show bands, beginning in the Maori Volcanics. The Howard Morrison Quartet was formed in the mid-1950s. Their 1959 parody of &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot; called &quot;The Battle of the Waikato&quot; became one of their biggest hits and a parody of &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; called &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s an All Black&quot; was topical because of the controversy over Māori players not being allowed to tour apartheid South Africa with the 1960 All Blacks in South Africa. The quartet disbanded in 1965 and Morrison went onto a successful solo career. After establishing a reputation in Wellington in the 1950s, the Maori Hi Five played numerous styles and proved very popular. The band went to Australia and later to the United States where they worked in clubs and casinos. Prince Tui Teka joined the Maori Volcanics in Sydney in 1968. In 1972 he began a solo career, returning to New Zealand.

===Awards===

The Aotearoa Music Awards began awarding the Polynesian record of the year in 1982. In 1992, this category developed into the Aotearoa Music Award for Best Māori Artist; initially as Best Maori Album in 1992 and 1993. Between 1996 and 2003, two awards were released: Best Mana Maori Album for works embodying Māori music, and Best Reo Maori Album for works sung in te reo Māori. In 2003, the APRA Awards began awarding the Maioha Award, to recognise excellence in contemporary Māori music. The first Waiata Māori Music Awards were held in 2008, acknowledging both contemporary and traditional genres.

<text>Heart Colchester (formerly SGR Colchester) was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Colchester and the surrounding areas. The station was launched in 1993 as SGR Colchester by the East Anglian Radio group, which also operated the Ipswich-based SGR-FM, Radio Broadland in Norwich, and Amber Radio across Suffolk and Norfolk.

==History== 
The station, serving a population of around 150,000, broadcast programmes from its studios in the town during daytime (6am - 6pm) but shared output from its larger sister SGR station in Ipswich at other times. The Colchester station was an immediate success and quickly built an impressive audience locally, soon establishing itself as market leader. Staff in the early years included Mike Stewart (group programme director), Danny Cox (station manager) and presenters Nick Jackson and Simon Taylor.

It became part of the GWR Group when East Anglian Radio was taken over in 1996. In January 2009, owners Global Radio re-branded SGR Colchester as &quot;Heart Colchester&quot; and the following year, it was merged with Heart Essex, resulting in the closure of the station&#x27;s studio base in the town.

<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Vyssotsky (, 23 May 1888 – 31 December 1973) was a Russian-American astronomer. Born in Moscow, in 1923 he moved to the United States, where he eventually became professor at the University of Virginia and vice-president of the American Astronomical Society.

During his 35 years at the McCormick Observatory of the University of Virginia, he was sequentially promoted from instructor to assistant professor in 1928, and to professor in 1937. His best known work is probably a catalog with five lists of stars titled &quot;Dwarf M Stars Found Spectrophotometrically&quot;. This work was important because it was the first list of nearby stars identified not by their motions in the sky, but by their intrinsic, spectroscopic, characteristics. Until this time, most nearby stars had been identified by their large proper motions; however, not all stars close to the Sun have a large proper motion, and this selection criteria caused a bias in studies before the advent of Vyssotsky&#x27;s catalogue. Vyssotsky&#x27;s survey was carried out at McCormick Observatory using a 10-inch Cooke astrograph, donated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington and refigured by J. W. Fecker. It was used with an objective prism, which allowed spectra to be taken of all the stars in the field of view simultaneously. The spectra allowed Vyssotsky and others to classify the stars according to the surface temperature and gravity of the stars, and they identified thousands of dwarf M stars (which are intrinsically faint, and therefore had to be nearby if they were visible through the 10-inch).

Vyssotsky spent his youth in Moscow, Russia, where he worked in a major observatory. He served in the Russian army and took part in World War I, where he used his knowledge of French, English and German to translate intercepted radio communications. After the October Revolution he joined the anti-communist White movement, and after its defeat escaped to Turkey and then to Tunisia, where he worked as a science teacher. In 1923 he moved to the United States, where in 1929 he married a fellow astronomer Emma Vyssotsky. She was his lifelong scientific collaborator. They had one son, Victor A. Vyssotsky, a mathematician and computer scientist who was involved in Multics project and created the Darwin computer game.

<text>Smooth North West is a regional radio station owned by Communicorp UK and operated by Global as part of the Smooth network. The station broadcasts to the North West of England from studios at Spinningfields in Manchester.

== History ==

===GMG Radio ownership===

The station was launched by Radio Investments Ltd on 1 September 1994 as Jazz FM, but was also known as JFM in an attempt to appeal to listeners who could be put off by the use of the word &quot;jazz&quot;. Jazz FM originally played a wide variety of jazz, pandering to more smooth jazz during the daytime in order to attract the 25- to 45-year-old target market which was required to make the station a success. However, the focus of the music later changed, and by the early 2000s, it was focusing more on soul and softer R&amp;B alongside jazz.

100.4 Jazz FM broadcast its daytime shows from its Manchester station, but specialist shows such as Dinner Jazz and Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis were networked from its London sister station 102.2 Jazz FM.

In 2003, the Guardian Media Group did extensive research into the type of music that listeners in the north-west wanted to hear. They concluded that many people were dissuaded by the name &quot;jazz&quot;, and as a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as Smooth FM on 2 March 2004.

The station now began to play more modern music during the day, but continued a mostly jazz themed output at night. The arrangements for local and networked programming remained for a time, but from March 2005, only Mike Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;The Saturday Night Experience&quot; was networked from 102.2 Smooth FM. All other programming was produced and aired in the North West.

The station was relaunched again as Smooth Radio 100.4 on 26 March 2007. The launch occurred at the same time as London based 102.2 Smooth FM, however Smooth Radio 100.4 continued with its own unique soul music based format. On 5 July 2007, GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format from Ofcom, which would bring Smooth Radio 100.4 in line with the rest of the network. It proposed an easy listening music service mixed with speech for the over 50&#x27;s, coupled with an improved local news service. Ofcom approved the changes on 11 October 2007.

In March 2008, GMG requested a format change to remove its jazz commitments it has in place for Smooth Radio 100.4. Part of the plans included a relaunch of Jazz FM from the jazzfm.com service broadcasting on DAB in Glasgow and online on the MXR North West multiplex. In a meeting on 22 April 2008 Ofcom denied GMG&#x27;s request to drop its jazz commitments. GMG said that it would be relaunching Jazz FM despite the decision.

Local and networked programming originated from studios at Laser House in Salford Quays.

In 2010, GMG announced that it would be merging its five Smooth stations in England to create a nationwide Smooth Radio service based in Salford. The new station was launched on 4 October 2010 and could be heard both on DAB and on the locally on the FM frequencies.

===Global Radio franchisee under Communicorp ownership===

Smooth Radio&#x27;s output was relocated to new owner Global&#x27;s Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October 2013, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air.

Global reached an agreement to sell Smooth North West and seven others to Communicorp, as part of a plan to allay competition fears following Global&#x27;s purchase of GMG Radio.

On 4 February 2014, the &quot;Radio Today&quot; website reported that Ofcom had given Global permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output on weekdays (four hours at weekends) and a regional news service.

In May 2017, local programming moved from Salford to new studios at the XYZ building in the Spinningfields district of Manchester City Centre. Smooth North West shares facilities with sister station Radio X 90s and two Global-owned stations, Heart North West and Capital Manchester and Lancashire.

In September 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth&#x27;s local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London. Local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained, alongside the station&#x27;s North West breakfast show.

On 24 February 2025 a fully networked schedule of programming across all Smooth Radio stations in England was reinstated, with the London-based breakfast show hosted by Jenni Falconer rolled out to the stations in place of local/regional morning programmes; split localised news and advertising were retained. Smooth North West breakfast host at the time, Darren Parks, was retained by Smooth Radio and appointed to host the networked &quot;Smooth Sanctuary&quot; strand on weekday evenings.

==Programming==
&quot;The Smooth Sanctuary&quot; with Darren Parks is produced and broadcast from Global&#x27;s Manchester studios from 7-10pm on weekdays, for broadcast across the Smooth Radio network. Other networked programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Smooth Breakfast&quot; with Jenni Falconer and &quot;The Smooth Drive Home&quot; with Angie Greaves.

===News===
Global&#x27;s Newsroom broadcasts hourly regional news bulletins from 6am-7pm on weekdays and 6am-12pm at weekends. The bulletins are produced for Communicorp by Global&#x27;s Manchester newsroom.

National news updates air hourly from Global&#x27;s London headquarters at all other times.

<text>The Print Mint, Inc. was a major publisher and distributor of underground comix based in the San Francisco Bay Area during the genre&#x27;s late 1960s-early 1970s heyday. Starting as a retailer of psychedelic posters, the Print Mint soon evolved into a publisher, printer, and distributor. It was &quot;ground zero&quot; for the psychedelic poster. The Print Mint was originally owned by poet Don Schenker and his wife Alice, who later partnered in the business with Bob and Peggy Rita.

== History ==
=== Berkeley retailer ===
Don and Alice Schenker started The Print Mint as a picture-framing shop and retailer of posters and fine art reproductions on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California, in December 1965, originally sharing a store with Moe&#x27;s Books, but later on moving into a separate location down the block. 

Moe&#x27;s Books owner, Moe Moskowitz, and the Schenkers had been friends back in New York City during the 1950s Beat era, so this association was a continuation of that connection. Schencker&#x27;s first comic book release was a reprint of Joel Beck&#x27;s self-published &quot;Lenny of Laredo&quot;, published by the Print Mint in April 1966.

=== Berkeley poster wholesaler ===
The Print Mint soon opened a wholesale division, publishing and distributing posters. The dance venues at The Avalon Ballroom and The Fillmore were advertised by posters designed by artists Stanley Mouse, Rick Griffin, Alton Kelley, Victor Moscoso, and others. These posters were soon in much demand, and The Print Mint distributed many of them along with work by Peter Keymack, Hambly silkscreens, Solo Period posters, M. C. Escher prints, Neon Rose, Bob Frieds Food line, and many others.

=== Haight, San Francisco retailer ===
In December 1966, the Print Mint opened a second store on Haight Street, in the Haight Ashbury district of San Francisco, in a building that Moskowitz had purchased to install a bookstore. The city refused to give Moskowitz a permit to sell used books, so his plan was never realized. 1967 was an eventful time, and the store became a center of neighborhood activities and a main source of countercultural information and creative energy to the huge influx of young people coming into San Francisco that summer. It grew from being a simple retailer into a complex cross-country distribution and then publishing operation. In December, however, Moskowitz forfeited the building and his plans for a second location for Moe&#x27;s Books, bringing a demise to Print Mint in San Francisco.

=== Berkeley underground comics wholesaler ===
Beginning in 1968, but really getting going in 1969, publishing and distribution of underground comics became The Print Mint&#x27;s major endeavor. With their partners the Ritas (employees that the Schenkers had offered a partnership to in 1967), Don did the organizing, editing, and layout of the books, working with the artists. Bob and Peggy Rita and Alice handled the distribution and the day-to-day operations of the business. Bob Rita had previously run Third World Distribution out of a Haight Street location. Alice also oversaw the Berkeley store. The company&#x27;s main office was located at 830 Folger Avenue in Berkeley.

The first comix Print Mint published was the (initially) weekly tabloid &quot;Yellow Dog&quot;, edited by Don Schencker. They also re-issued Gilbert Shelton&#x27;s &quot;Feds &#x27;n&#x27; Heads&quot;, which he had initially self-published. Eventually, the Print Mint published such underground comix notables as Robert Crumb, Trina Robbins, Rick Griffin, S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, and Robert Williams. Titles they published included &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, &quot;Junkwaffel&quot;, &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;, and &quot;Moondog&quot;. In addition, they published one of the first ecologically themed comics, &quot;The Dying Dolphin&quot;, a solo effort by rock poster artist Jim Evans with contributions by Ron Cobb and Rick Griffin.

As the first publisher to invest heavily in the underground comix movement (and its distribution), the Print Mint was instrumental in the form&#x27;s popularity and widespread reach in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As they were growing the market and putting money in the hands of the cartoonists, however, their business practices were called into question by a number of the more popular artists. A few of those, including Gilbert Shelton and Frank Stack, broke off in early 1969 to form their own publisher, Rip Off Press, taking some of the more established cartoonists (like Crumb) with them. The 1973–1974 venture Cartoonists Co-Op Press was formed out of a similar motivation. From that point on, the Print Mint focused more on bringing new talent into the burgeoning underground industry.

The Print Mint&#x27;s bold experiment with &quot;Arcade: The Comix Revue&quot;, started in 1975 and edited by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith, with most issues sporting a cover by R. Crumb, paved the way for &quot;RAW!&quot; just a few years later.

=== Underground comics &quot;pornography&quot; arrest ===
The Print Mint weathered a lawsuit filed over the publication of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, particularly issue No. 4 (published in 1969). The Schenkers were arrested and charged with publishing pornography by the Berkeley Police Department. Previous to that, Simon Lowinsky, owner of the Phoenix Gallery on College Avenue in Berkeley, had organized an exhibition of the &quot;Zap&quot; collective&#x27;s original drawings, and had been arrested on the same charge. His case came to trial first. He was acquitted after supportive testimony from Peter Selz, a prominent figure in the art world. At that point, the city dropped the charges against the Print Mint.

=== Retail and wholesale split ===
By 1975 the partnership with the Ritas was not going smoothly. Alice Schenker says that an agreement was made to split the business between retail and wholesale, the Schenkers taking the retail store — &quot;Reprint Mint&quot; — and the Ritas the wholesale and publishing. The Print Mint ceased publishing comics in 1978, with the last two titles published being the comics anthologies &quot;Lemme Outta Here&quot;, edited by Diane Noomin, and &quot;The Human Drama&quot;, edited by Jim Madow.

The retail poster shop continued. In 1985 the Schenkers sold the retail store. Reprint Mint closed in late November 2016.

<text>Messier 108 (also known as NGC 3556, nicknamed the Surfboard Galaxy) is a barred spiral galaxy about 46 million light-years away from Earth in the northern constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781 or 1782. From the Earth, this galaxy is seen almost edge-on.

This galaxy is an isolated member of the Ursa Major Cluster of galaxies in the local supercluster. It has a morphological classification of type SBbc in the de Vaucouleurs system, which means it is a barred spiral galaxy with somewhat loosely wound arms. The maximum angular size of the galaxy in the optical band is 11′.1 × 4′.6, and it is inclined 75° to the line of sight.

This galaxy has an estimated mass of 125 billion solar masses () and bears about 290 ± 80 globular clusters. Examination of the distribution of neutral hydrogen in this galaxy shows discrete shells of expanding gas extending for several kiloparsecs, known as H1 supershells. These may be driven by currents of dark matter, dust and gas contributing to large star formation, having caused supernovae explosions. Alternatively they may result from an infall from the intergalactic medium or arise from radio jets.

Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory have identified 83 X-ray sources, including a source at the nucleus. The brightest of these is consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole accreting matter. The galaxy is also emitting a diffuse soft X-ray radiation within 2.6 arcminutes of the optical galaxy. The spectrum of the source at the core is consistent with an active galactic nucleus, but an examination with the Spitzer Space Telescope showed no indication of activity. The supermassive black hole at the core has an estimated mass of 24 million solar masses ().

== Supernovae ==
Three supernovae have been observed in M108:
* SN 1969B (type unknown, mag. 16) was discovered by Paul Wild on 6 February 1969. It reached a brightness of mag. 13.9.
* SPIRITS 16tn was discovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope in August 2016. The supernova was only visible in infrared light, because it was heavily obscured by dust. Its extinction was estimated to be 8–9 mag, making it one of the most heavily obscured supernovae ever observed.
* SN 2023dbc (Type Ic, mag. 17) was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility on 13 March 2023. 2023dbc is likely a stripped-envelope supernova as there is no evidence for hydrogen in these spectra beyond narrow emission associated with the underlying HII region. It is among the nearest type Ic supernovae discovered to date.

<text>The Impossible Bird is an album by British singer-songwriter Nick Lowe. Produced by Lowe and Neil Brockbank, it was released in the United Kingdom in 1994 on Demon Records and elsewhere by Upstart Records.

==Reception==

In a contemporary review of &quot;The Impossible Bird&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Paul Evans said that the album showed Lowe &quot;in excellent form&quot; with songs that &quot;demonstrate a prodigious productivity and an emotional realism that ranges from heartbreak... to a well-earned bittersweet humor&quot;. &quot;People&quot; called it a &quot;high point&quot; for Lowe, while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Mike Boehm wrote: &quot;The only real impossibility on this album lies in trying to resist the gently seductive pop charms of the crafty old bird who made it.&quot; Less receptive was Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who merely gave the album a &quot;neither&quot; rating.

<text>Fosseway Radio was an Independent Local Radio station based in Leicestershire, and owned by Lincs FM Group. It served the south-west of that county, as well as North Warwickshire. It was based on &quot;Castle Street&quot; in Hinckley. The name of the station referred to the nearby Fosse Way, which marks the frontier of Roman Britain. It runs between Lincoln and Leicester, then on to Bath and Exeter. In Leicestershire, the best-preserved section is a 4-mile stretch close to the market town of Hinckley, from High Cross to Stoney Bridge near Sapcote.

==History==
Fosseway Radio had an enviable and impressive heritage of local involvement and local broadcasting stretching well over twenty years. Studio equipment was basic and often home-made but the group had clear determination to produce a local radio service for the people of Hinckley, broadcasting under the name of Fosseway Radio.

The group produced music tapes, which were distributed to several factories and workplaces across the Hinckley area. They raised several thousand pounds for local charities, including The Dorothy Goodman Special School and Park House Home for the Elderly in Earl Shilton. So unique was the project that Malcolm Munro from Central Television visited the &#x27;home-built&#x27; studios in Thornycroft Road in 1982 and the aspirations and clear enthusiasm of the group were featured on &quot;Central News&quot;.

Their aspirations were to see a truly local radio service for their home area. Disillusioned by events in the Leicestershire radio market and the subsequent collapse of Centre Radio, the group turned their attentions to building their individual careers, although maintaining their strong interest in local radio.

In the late 1980s, several members of the group were invited by the local health authority to launch a voluntary hospital radio service for the town&#x27;s cottage hospital. This was Castle Mead Radio and it is still going strong today, 20 years after launching. Interest in providing a service to the wider community remained and in 1993, Andy Carter wrote to the Radio Authority, on behalf of the group, to register their interest in providing a commercial radio service for their home area, an area very much betwixt and between Coventry and Leicester.

In October 1994, the Radio Authority announced that it intended to place Hinckley on their &#x27;working list&#x27; and much progress was made in gaining public support and interest. The group decided their commitment to distinctive local radio would be best demonstrated by operating a trial broadcast and in early 1995, Andrew Carter, Lee Carey, Jon Maynard and Maria Bush decided that Fosseway Radio should apply to operate Hinckley&#x27;s first trial local radio station. The process of initial, informal research began and contact with local businesses became a priority to finance the operation. The company was officially registered in October 1995.

Fosseway Radio launched its first trial service on 1 March 1996 to an expectant town. Its strengths would be its local knowledge of the area, local talent and to make it stand out from the rest of the FM stations of the time. Presenters knew and understood the area and judging by the response, Hinckley was by no means disappointed. Nita Baines from Barwell wrote to say, &quot;I really cannot thank you enough for bringing some sunshine back into my life, I hope it is summertime forever&quot;, while Pat and Barrie Parker from Hinckley told the station, &quot;Everyone is talking about Fosseway Radio and what a happier month March has been for having it.&quot;

Many listeners told the station of their delight when the service resumed for a second month in September 1996. Carolyn Loveridge wrote to say: &quot;Thank you once again for providing a professional and excellent service for South-West Leicestershire&quot;. Angel Gould, a leader at 1st Barwell Cubs, wrote to say she had discovered the station quite by chance and on questioning her cubs that evening she was surprised that a lot of them were already listening to Fosseway Radio, &quot;I hope the message gets through that they and myself like listening to Fosseway Radio and long may it continue&quot;.

Hinckley&#x27;s geographical location, equidistant between the two strong cities of Leicester and Coventry, resulted in the area being overlooked and often ignored. The area was too distant to be a suburb and held an identity of its own, an ideal location for a new commercial radio station.

In 1998, the Fosseway Radio team were delivered the news by the broadcasting authorities that they had been successful in their application, and the station launched on 1 November that year.

The transmitter was in the village of Barwell, but the station principally served the towns (and suburbs) of Hinckley and Nuneaton.

In 1999, the success of the station meant the coverage area was extended to the town of Nuneaton.

Nine years later, parent company the Lincs FM Group made their first acquisition, Oak 107 FM, from the CN Group. However, it was decided that this new service should also replace Fosseway Radio in Hinckley and Nuneaton, and Oak FM took control of the transmitter on Wednesday 26 March 2008. The two stations merged and originally maintained individual services for the two respective areas. This was however quickly altered, with programmes being shared outside of the breakfast show. Both the Hinckley and Loughborough services were co-located in Coalville in July 2008, and the breakfast shows also became networked in the summer of 2010, one of the first concessions allowed by the OFCOM Digital Economy Bill of the same year.

<text>Goya was a Norwegian motor freighter used as a troop transport by Nazi Germany and sunk with a massive loss of life near the end of World War II.

Completed in 1940 for the Johan Ludwig Mowinckel Rederi company, the ship was named after Spanish artist Francisco Goya. Following Germany&#x27;s invasion of Norway that year, she was seized by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and pressed into service as a troop transport.

Near the end of the war, &quot;Goya&quot; took part in Operation Hannibal, the evacuation of German military and civilian personnel from remaining pockets held by the Germans along the Baltic Sea. Loaded with thousands of refugees, the ship was sunk on 16 April 1945 by the Soviet submarine &quot;L-3&quot;. Most of the crew and passengers died in the sinking.

The sinking of &quot;Goya&quot; was one of the biggest single-incident maritime losses of life of the war, and one of the largest such losses in history, with just 183 survivors out of roughly 6,700 passengers and crew.

== Early service ==
&quot;Goya&quot; was originally built as a freighter by the Akers Mekaniske Verksted shipyard in Oslo, Norway, in 1940. The ship was 146 m (475.72 feet) long and 17.4 m (57.08 feet) wide, had a capacity of 5,230 GRT, and a top speed of 18 knots. Following the German occupation of Norway, the ship was seized by Germany and in 1942 refitted as an auxiliary transport vessel for German U-boats. In 1943, &quot;Goya&quot; was turned into a depot ship (tender), providing support to smaller vessels, but the following year was moved to Memel (present-day Klaipėda, Lithuania), where she was used as a target ship for torpedo practice by the 24th U-boat Flotilla.

In 1945, during Operation Hannibal, &quot;Goya&quot; was used as an evacuation ship, moving people west from the eastern and southern Baltic. Her commanding officer was Captain Plünnecke. &quot;Goya&quot; was marked as a hospital ship and carried over 1,000 hospital beds for very seriously wounded and immobile soldiers.

== Sinking ==
On 16 April 1945, &quot;Goya&quot; was sailing from Hel, around the Hel Peninsula and across the Baltic Sea to Kiel in western Germany. The convoy included &quot;Goya&quot;, two smaller vessels (&quot;Kronenfels&quot; and steam tug &quot;Aegir&quot;), and two minesweeper convoy escorts, and . Goya was just one of over 1,000 ships commissioned to participate in the Operation Hannibal evacuations organised by &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Commander-in-Chief Karl Dönitz. The ship, meant to accommodate 850 crew members, was crowded with over 7,000 evacuees, military personnel and wounded soldiers.

Four hours after leaving the port of Hel and while close to the southern tip of the Hel Peninsula, the convoy was attacked by Soviet bombers. During the air raids, a bomb dropped by the bombers hit &quot;Goya&quot;, but caused minimal damage. After rounding the Hel Peninsula and leaving Gdansk Bay, several miles north of Cape Rixhöft (Cape Rozewie), the convoy was sighted by Soviet minelayer submarine L-3, which also carried torpedoes. While &quot;Goya&quot; was faster than submarines, the convoy was slowed by engine problems on the &quot;Kronenfels&quot;, which also necessitated a 20-minute stop for repairs. At exactly four minutes before midnight (local time), &quot;L-3&quot; Captain Vladimir Konovalov gave the order to fire a spread of four torpedoes. Two of them hit &quot;Goya&quot;; one struck amidships, the second exploded in the stern, sending an immense plume of fire and smoke into the sky. The impact of the torpedoes was so great that the ship&#x27;s masts collapsed on refugees sleeping on the top deck. Within moments, the ship broke in two, fire consuming its upper portions. Shortly after midnight and less than four minutes after torpedo impact, &quot;Goya&quot; sank, drowning thousands in their beds.

== Casualties ==
&quot;Goya&quot;, a freighter not equipped with the safety features of a passenger ship, sank to a depth of approximately . Given the speed of the sinking, most passengers went down with her or died of hypothermia in the cold waters of the Baltic Sea.

The exact death toll is difficult to estimate. Authors cite the total number of passengers as &quot;over 6,000&quot;, 6,700, or 7,200, although the exact number might never be known; evacuated military personnel and civilians fleeing German enclaves in East Prussia and occupied Poland boarded ships in chaotic circumstances and often occupied all available space aboard. In any event, the death toll exceeded 6,000 and most likely reached 7,000, making the sinking one of the worst maritime disasters in history, exceeded only by the January 1945 sinking of the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;.

The exact number of survivors is also a matter of dispute; most estimates place it at approximately 182 people saved (176 soldiers and 6 civilians), of whom nine died shortly afterwards. However, other figures are also cited, notably 172 and 183.

== Discovery of wreck ==

The position of the wreck had long been known to Polish fishermen but was not identified and referred to as &quot;Wreck No. 88&quot; on Polish Navy maps. On 26 August 2002, the wreck was discovered by Polish technical divers Grzegorz Dominik, Michał Porada, and Marek Jagodziński, who also salvaged the ship&#x27;s compass.

Exactly 58 years after the sinking of &quot;Goya&quot;, the wreck was located on 16 April 2003 by an international expedition under the direction of Ulrich Restemeyer, aided by 3D-Sonar scanning. The position records of &quot;Goya&quot; accompanying ships were found to be incorrect, probably made during a hasty escape. During the rediscovery, another, smaller, ship was seen on the surface above the wreck and initially thought to carry fishermen. But when Restemeyer&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Fritz Reuter&quot;, approached, the other vessel, seemingly carrying divers, left.

The wreck lies at a depth of 76 meters (249 feet) below the surface of the Baltic Sea and is in remarkably good condition, though covered with nets. The wreck is littered with human remains. Survivors have lain wreaths at the surface to show their condolences for the 6,000 people who lost their lives here.

Shortly after the discovery, the wreck was officially declared a war grave by the Polish Maritime Office in Gdynia. In 2006, the decision was published in an official government gazette of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, making it illegal to dive within 500 metres of the wreck.

<text>The Construkction of Light (stylised as the construKction of light) is the twelfth studio album by English band King Crimson, released in May 2000 by record label Virgin. It is the first of two studio albums to feature the &quot;double duo&quot; line-up of Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto. It is the group&#x27;s longest studio album and the only one not to chart in the United States.

== Recording and release ==

In the late 1990s, drummer Bill Bruford and bassist Tony Levin left King Crimson, ending the &quot;double trio&quot; era documented on &quot;THRAK&quot;. For the first time in the group&#x27;s history, Robert Fripp was the only Englishman in the lineup.

&quot;The Construkction of Light&quot; bears a sound similar to the &quot;rock gamelan&quot; 1980s incarnation of King Crimson, with Mastelotto primarily playing electronic drums and Belew, Gunn and Fripp often playing sophisticated, interlocking parts. However, the pace of these interlocking parts is often slower than it was in the 1980s, with Belew and Fripp often trading single notes back and forth in hocket.

The album also contains two sequels to instrumental pieces by 1970s incarnations of the band. &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic – Part IV&quot; continues the series of pieces started on &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; and continued on &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;. &quot;FraKctured&quot; began as a fifth entry in the &quot;Larks&quot; suite, but was renamed after being judged as more reminiscent of &quot;Fracture&quot; from &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;.

Fripp was unhappy with the album, considering that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t convey the power of the music, to a greater extent than any of the [King Crimson] studio albums&quot;, as none of the music was played live before the recording, Mastelotto used only electronic drums instead of his preferred hybrid acoustic/electronic kit, and Fripp&#x27;s attention was focused more on writing and playing than on recording and production. Discipline Global Mobile later considered &quot;re-assembling&quot; the album with live recordings instead of reissuing the studio version.

In 2019, a substantial reworking of the album was released as &quot;The ReconstruKction of Light&quot;, when parts of the original recording were found to be lost. Mastelotto re-recorded all of his drum parts on a predominantly acoustic kit. The remix of &quot;FraKctured&quot; was released as part of the KC50 series of archival recordings that year.

== Reception ==
AllMusic wrote that the band &quot;fall flat with &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; [...] Unable to shed the weight of their oft-brilliant history, the most promising moments of &quot;ConstruKction&quot; are crushed underneath the bulk. What makes &quot;ConstruKction&quot; such a disappointment is, despite how &#x27;progressive&#x27; the band-fragmenting ProjeKct approach appeared on paper, upon execution, it produced an utterly backward-looking album.&quot;

German prog magazine &quot;eclipsed&quot;, on the other hand, rated the album as the third best King Crimson album ever, and also included it in their list of the 150 best progressive rock albums of all time.

Regarding the revised 2019 version, Mark Smotroff of &quot;Audiophile Review&quot; noted that &quot;the dynamics are much better...Mastelotto has arguably rescued this album by adding an impassioned new live drum track.&quot;

==Track listing==

<text>Messier 109 (also known as NGC 3992 or the Vacuum Cleaner Galaxy) is a barred spiral galaxy exhibiting a weak inner ring structure around the central bar approximately away in the northern constellation Ursa Major. M109 can be seen south-east of the star Phecda (γ UMa, Gamma Ursa Majoris).

==History==
Messier 109 was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781. Two years later Charles Messier catalogued the object, as an appended object to his publication.

Between the 1920s through the 1950s, it was considered that Messier objects over 103 were not official, but later the additions, further referred target objects from Méchain, became more widely accepted. David H. Levy mentions the modern 110 object catalog while Sir Patrick Moore places the limit at 104 objects but has M105 to 109 listed as addenda. By the late 1970s all 110 objects are commonly used among astronomers and remain so.

==General information==

This galaxy is the most distant object in the Messier Catalog, followed by M91.

M109 has three satellite galaxies (UGC 6923, UGC 6940 and UGC 6969) and possibly more. Detailed hydrogen line observations have been obtained from M109 and its satellites. M109&#x27;s H I (H one) distribution is regular with a low-level radial extension outside the stellar disc, while in the bar is a central H I hole in the gas distribution. Possibly the gas has been transported inwards by the bar, and because of the emptiness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in the recent past.

M109 is the brightest galaxy in the M109 Group, a large group of galaxies in the constellation Ursa Major that may number over 50.

==Supernova==
One supernova has been observed in M109: SN1956A (typeIa, mag. 12.3) was discovered by H. S. Gates on 8 March 1956, using the 18-inch Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory. It was located 67&quot; east and 9&quot; south of the center of the galaxy.

<doc id="975053" wikidata="Q673556" url="?curid=975053" title="War of the Reunions">
<text>The War of the Reunions (1683–84) was a conflict between France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, with limited involvement by Genoa. It can be seen as a continuation of the War of Devolution (1667–1668) and the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), which were driven by Louis XIV&#x27;s determination to establish defensible boundaries along France&#x27;s northern and eastern borders.

Despite the peace established by the 1678 Treaty of Nijmegen, Louis retained a large army, an action extremely unusual in the period. In 1681, his troops seized Strasbourg and in 1682 occupied the Principality of Orange, then a possession of William of Orange. When hostilities began in 1683, French support for the Ottomans in their war with Austria allowed Louis to capture Luxembourg and consolidate his position in Alsace.

The Truce of Ratisbon that ended the conflict marked the high water mark of French territorial gains under Louis XIV. Afterwards, his opponents would recognize the need for unity in order to resist further expansion, leading to the 1688 creation of the Grand Alliance, an anti-French coalition that fought in the Nine Years&#x27; War and the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Background==
Under the treaties of Westphalia in 1648, Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668 and Nijmegen in 1678, France acquired territories in the Rhineland and along its northern border with the Spanish Netherlands. When a town changed hands, it normally included the economic hinterland surrounding it but treaties often failed to define the boundaries of these dependent regions. Although willing to negotiate those within the Spanish Netherlands on a bilateral basis, Louis regarded acquisitions in Alsace and Lorraine as essential to securing his borders. For these areas, he set up &quot;Chambers of Reunion&quot; to determine whether France had been awarded all the territory owed; since those appointed to the Chambers were French lawyers, the normal result was to demand additional concessions but as these generally consisted of small towns and villages, they went unopposed.

The exceptions were Strasbourg and Luxembourg, both of which remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. While France controlled much of the surrounding area, the bridge over the Rhine at Strasbourg had been used by Imperial troops to invade Alsace on three occasions during the Franco-Dutch War. In the same way, Luxembourg dominated regions annexed from the Spanish Netherlands. Louis believed that only the possession of these two could ensure the security of his newly acquired territories. Imperial troops could not respond since they were engaged in the Great Turkish War, the largest offensive ever by the Ottomans against the Empire&#x27;s eastern border.

Strasbourg was occupied on 30 September 1681 and officially became part of France, although it retained a degree of economic and political autonomy until 1726. Marshal Boufflers simultaneously laid siege to Luxembourg but Louis now decided it was impolitic for him to attack another Christian kingdom while it was under attack from the Turks and in March 1682 Boufflers withdrew his troops. However, on 12 September 1683 a combined Imperial, German and Polish army defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna and forced them to retreat.

==War==
After halting the Ottoman advance at Vienna, the Habsburgs were able to turn their attentions to the west. Spain declared war on France on 26 October 1683 and on the night of 3–4 November, an army under the Duke of Humières entered the Spanish Netherlands and surrounded Courtrai. After it surrendered on 6 November, he then advanced on Diksmuide, which surrendered without a fight on 10th. Between 22 and 26 December, a second force under Marshal François de Créquy bombarded Luxembourg with 3,000 to 4,000 mortar shells but with winter approaching and the city refusing to yield, he withdrew.

Louis renewed the siege of Luxembourg in April 1684, assisted by his technical expert on siege warfare, Sébastien le Prestre de Vauban. Its 2,500 defenders surrendered on 3 June, although fighting continued elsewhere until the Truce of Ratisbon on 15 August 1684. France retained territory taken during the war, including Strasbourg and Luxembourg and subsequent actions were intended to make the truce permanent.

Despite its limited scope and length, the war is remembered as being especially bloody, since Louis XIV deliberately employed violence as state policy, with the aim of pressuring enemy officials to surrender. Louvois ordered Montal to burn 20 villages near Charleroi because the Spanish previously destroyed two barns on the outskirts of two French villages, and insisted that not a single house should remain standing.

A separate but related conflict took place in the Republic of Genoa, whose bankers and financial houses such as the Centurioni, Palavicini and Vivaldi families had longstanding relationships with Spain, and had been lending money to its government since the 16th century. During the recent war, they allowed the Spanish to recruit mercenaries from Genoese territory and use their port building some galleys for the Spanish navy. As a punishment, on 5 May a French fleet commanded by Admiral Abraham Duquesne left the Mediterranean naval base of Toulon and began a bombardment of Genoa on 17 May 1684, which lasted for the next 12 days apart from a short truce for negotiations. By the time it concluded on 28 May, two thirds of the city had been destroyed.

==Peace and treaty==
While Louis refused to send aid to the Empire and even dispatched secret envoys to encourage the Ottomans, contemporary accounts indicate that it would be unseemly for him to continue fighting the Empire on its western border. Thus, Louis agreed to the Truce of Ratisbon, guaranteeing 20 years of peace between France and the Empire and asked his first cousin, Charles II of England, to arbitrate the disputed border claims.

==Aftermath==
The war, like its immediate continental predecessors, failed to resolve the festering conflict between the French Bourbon dynasty and the Spanish and Austrian branches of the Habsburg dynasty. The brief but brutal conflict was one of the precursors to the lengthier Nine Years&#x27; War.

<text>102.2 Jazz FM (also known as London Jazz Radio and JFM) was an Independent Local Radio for London run by GMG Radio. The station was based in and broadcast from Castlereagh Street in London. The station experimented with its core playlist over its fifteen-year history, incorporating smooth jazz, mainstream jazz, soul, jazz fusion, acid jazz, blues and rhythm and blues. In 1994, the station changed its name to &quot;JFM&quot; to encourage more listeners who were put off by the &#x27;Jazz&#x27; in the station&#x27;s name. Richard Wheatly was appointed in 1995 to turn the station around when there was only three months&#x27; money left to run the station. He made a number of sweeping changes to the playlist, selling a sister station and changing the name back to Jazz FM, as well as starting up a record label and spin-off business deals and opportunities which helped Jazz FM swing into the black and make a profit in 2001.

In July 2002, after a relaxation in ownership rules from the publication of the Communications Bill, the Guardian Media Group&#x27;s (GMG) radio division was able to purchase the station for £44.5 million. GMG made more changes to the playlist, shifting to more R&amp;B, soul, easy listening and adult contemporary music during the daytime. In 2004 with the agreement of Ofcom, jazz was dropped from the daytime schedules, but a requirement of 45 hours per week of jazz was retained, this to be played during the night.

In June 2005, GMG Radio replaced the station with adult contemporary station 102.2 Smooth FM. GMG cited a number of reasons for replacing Jazz FM, including poor listening figures, not making money, the &#x27;Jazz&#x27; name putting off potential listeners as well as not enough jazz for jazz purists. The Jazz FM name was retained by GMG for the relaunched ejazz.fm website service which was renamed jazzfm.com on the same day as the launch of Smooth FM. The station broadcast on digital satellite, online and on spare DAB capacity in Yorkshire, South Wales and the Severn Estuary where 102.2 Smooth FM and the defunct Smooth Digital service would have been duplicated.

On 28 February 2008, GMG Radio announced the potential return of Jazz FM in London on DAB radio, digital satellite and the Internet as a relaunch of the current jazzfm.com service. The station relaunched on 6 October 2008.

==History==
The station was launched as a result of a ten-year campaign by musician Dave Lee and Jasper Grinling (CBE 1978; Chairman, London Jazz Radio plc, 1989–91) who was inspired after listening to a Los Angeles jazz radio station, which has turned into a classical station. In 1980, Lee wrote the following to the Independent Broadcasting Authority: &quot;Dear Sir, I hereby apply for a licence to open a jazz radio station in London.&quot;

With competition from Kiss FM for one of the Londonwide incremental radio licenses, the IBA awarded the London Jazz Radio group the licence on 12 July 1989. Ron Onions, the former editor-in-chief of LBC, was appointed station director. As Jazz FM the station launched on 4 March 1990 with an Ella Fitzgerald concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Fitzgerald was flown in by the station to perform the concert, at which she sang with the Count Basie Orchestra; the concert was her last appearance in Europe. To promote the station, Jazz FM paid out £750,000 for advertising on ITV.

Jazz FM faced insolvency in its early life. Broadcast Investments made an offer of £348,000 to purchase the station. Broadcast Investments withdrew the offer when Golden Rose Communications made a higher offer of £500,000 for the station. Golden Rose Communications took over the station in 1991. Former finance director Alastair Mackenzie stated that in an interview in 2002 that the station had run out of money three times in 1991, and he also helped with a management buy-in of the station for £435,000 in 1992.

Jazz FM&#x27;s licence was put up for renewal in 1993 by the Radio Authority. As well as Jazz FM, there was a bid for the licence from Euro Jazz London, which included ex-Jazz FM employees. Jazz FM retained its licence to broadcast.

In 1994, the name of the station was changed to JFM by the station&#x27;s management in order to appeal to more listeners who may have been put off by the name &quot;jazz&quot; in Jazz FM, and who thought that Jazz FM only played jazz records. The station spent £500,000 on publicising the name change. Richard Wheatly was appointed chief executive officer in 1995 to revive JFM which was running out of money due to both JFM and sister radio station Viva AM, a radio station for women. When Wheatly joined JFM, the station had three months cash remaining in the bank. Golden Rose Communications was floated on the stock exchange in the early part of 1995. Wheatly sold Viva AM which was losing £100,000 a month before the sale for £3 million to Mohamed Al-Fayed as part of his cost-cutting plans. After 15 months of being branded as JFM, in the autumn of 1995 the name reverted to Jazz FM after Wheatly asked the Radio Authority for approval to change the name of the station back from JFM to Jazz FM. The change back to Jazz FM was reported to have cost £900,000.

Golden Rose Communications opened a jazz themed restaurant, &quot;Cafe Jazbar&quot; in Liverpool in April 1997. The restaurant was operated under a joint venture with Regent Inns. A travel service in partnership with Thomas Cook Group and British Airways was also set up. There were plans for jazz retail outlets named &quot;Jazshops&quot; to sell CDs and merchandise.

In December 1997, Golden Rose Communications planned to make a bid for Melody 105.4 FM which failed. The station was purchased by EMAP and rebranded Magic 105.4 FM.

Beginning in 1998, Jazz FM wanted to expand its operation across the UK. The station made bids to run stations on FM frequencies in Central Scotland, the North East of England, South Wales, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and Glasgow. Jazz FM withdrew from bidding for an FM licence in the East Midlands because chief executive Richard Wheatly believed that a dance station would secure the licence. The East Midlands FM licence was awarded to Saga 106.6 FM which started broadcasting in 2003. Jazz FM did become a member of the MXR consortium and did launch on DAB multiplexes operated by MXR as well as Switch Digital multiplexes in London and Central Scotland.

The station signed a deal with Clear Channel Communications in February 1999. The deal not only invested £3 million into the station but also allowed Jazz FM to advertise on unused advertising billboards.

On 12 December 1999, Golden Rose Communications changed its name to Jazz FM plc. In January 2002, Jazz FM plc made a £20 million bid for London talk radio station London News Radio. The bid was backed by the Guardian Media Group (GMG) and Clear Channel International. If the bid had succeeded, the station would have combined London News Radio&#x27;s operations with its own to save money. The station was later sold to the Chrysalis Group for £23.5 million. In May 2002, GMG made a bid of £41 million to Jazz FM plc at 180p per share. The bid came on the day the draft Communication Bill was published.

Jazz FM plc&#x27;s largest shareholder, Clear Channel, had been waiting for a 220p-per-share bid, but agreed to the 180p-per-share bid in late May. Herald Investment Management, which had a 7.7% stake in the company, and Aberforth Partners were unhappy with the 180p-per-share bid. On 6 June, GMG raised its bid to 195p per share to secure the institutional shareholders who were holding out for a better bid. Richard Wheatly announced that he would leave Jazz FM once the takeover was complete. The offer was declared wholly unconditional on 5 July. In December 2002, GMG moved its sales operation from Clear Channel Radio Sales to the Chrysalis Group, inline with the sales operation for other GMG Radio stations.

===Jazz FM TV===
Plans for a Jazz FM TV channel to start in the middle of 2004 were reported by websites from 2003. The channel would have been a mix of music videos and documentaries.

===Making way for Smooth FM===

In 2005, GMG dropped the name &quot;jazz&quot; name and rebranded Jazz FM Smooth FM. Chief Executive John Myers said, &quot;As sorry as we are to say goodbye to Jazz FM, it&#x27;s a sad fact of life that it has never made a profit in its 15 years of existence.&quot; However, in 2001 Jazz FM plc did make a profit before tax for the six months to December 2000 of £60,000, with most of the profit coming from Hed Kandi and other Jazz FM Records CD sales, a move of Jazz FM&#x27;s sales team to Clear Channel&#x27;s control, saving Jazz FM plc £1 million every year and increased revenues from advertising due to higher audience figures. Jazz FM also announced in 2001 that it had made full year profits before tax of £134,000 to 30 June 2001.

Other reasons given for rebranding included disappointing RAJAR figures, that the Jazz FM name discouraged people from listening, and that the station wasn&#x27;t playing enough jazz for the purists. The latter situation was solved by GMG Radio when it invested in the ejazz.fm website and changed the name to jazzfm.com at the same time 102.2 Jazz FM became 102.2 Smooth FM. Included in the investment would be two dedicated jazz stations.

The North West version of Jazz FM was the first to rebrand on 1 March 2004, followed by the London version (including the Freeview and many of the DAB feeds) on 7 June 2005. During the last few weeks before the start of Smooth FM, Jazz FM changed its jingles slightly from &quot;Smooth Jazz and Classic Soul&quot; to &quot;London&#x27;s Smooth Favourites&quot; as an indication to listeners of the change to come. Jazz FM in its previous form closed on Friday 27 May 2005. The last track it played was &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot; by Ella Fitzgerald.

===Return to the airwaves===

The station continued to broadcast after the launch of Smooth FM under the Jazz FM name as jazzfm.com on the Internet and on Digital Audio Broadcasting in West Central Scotland at a higher bit rate.

On 28 February 2008 GMG Radio&#x27;s chief executive John Myers announced that Jazz FM would return in London, the North West, and the West Midlands on DAB. Myers also said it would make more sense to have a dedicated radio station for jazz listeners than the 45 hours of jazz on Smooth FM, as required by the licence granted to them by Ofcom. The closing of theJazz on Digital One was one reason for the return of Jazz FM. The relaunch of jazzfm.com, under a three-year deal with The Local Radio Company, happened on 6 October 2008.

==Playlist==
When Jazz FM launched, the station played a mixture of mainstream jazz, with the daytime schedules dedicated to smooth jazz and soul. Specialist programming from Jez Nelson and concerts were broadcast in the evening and at weekends. In 1992, the policy changed, and all non-jazz programming was taken off the schedules.

In 1994, alongside the change of name to JFM, the core playlist was changed under agreement with the Radio Authority to give a more mainstream sound of soul, jazz fusion, and blues music, with a requirement that only 25% of music played on the station had to be jazz.

In 1995, when the name changed back to Jazz FM, smooth jazz and fusion were reduced. More popular mainstream jazz was put in the playlist.

Chief Executive Officer Richard Wheatly noted the station format was in trouble because of its serious straight jazz playlist. To counteract this downturn in listeners to Jazz FM, beginning in 1998, Wheatly introduced varied jazz into the daytime playlists. Beginning in February 1998, smooth jazz and soul were more integrated into the core playlist of Jazz FM.

Although from the start Jazz FM played jazz, soul and softer R&amp;B were added to appeal to the 25-45-year-old market. This was especially true after GMG Radio took over the running of the station and in November 2004 after an agreement with Ofcom, when jazz was dropped from the daytime playlists. John Simon, GMG programme director, said that the station was never licensed as a jazz station, but as a station that played a broad range of black music styles.

===Ofcom licensing requirements===
As part of its licence agreement with Jazz FM, Ofcom stated that Jazz FM had to dedicate at least 50% of the daytime output before 19:00 to jazz, and that the music &quot;must sit well with the label jazz&quot;. However, from 15 November 2004, as part of an agreement with GMG, Ofcom agreed to allow GMG to change the format, with the 50% jazz in daytime requirement dropped. John Myers said, &quot;The policy we are going on is ratings by day, reputation by night. Jazz is much more of a night-time listen so the changes fit well.&quot; As a result, jazz was increased from 40 to 45 hours and the Dinner Jazz programme hours were increased from two to three.

===Criticism===

Since the station began in 1990, fans of traditional and modern jazz criticised Jazz FM for playing more &#x27;accessible&#x27; music, such as smooth jazz, British jazz and blues singer George Melly stated to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2003 that he had become so disillusioned with Jazz FM&#x27;s playlist he had stopped listening to the station, describing the music as &quot;middle of the road&quot;. Grammy Award-winning jazz musician John Chilton stated that Jazz FM was failing to reach its remit for jazz and that he would prefer the station adopt a jazz-only policy. In a 2006 article for theJazz, musician Digby Fairweather said Jazz FM had turned into a &quot;tragic and swift disaster story&quot; and that the change of playlist was &quot;responsible for both the attempted rape and (fortunately abortive) re-definition of the music&quot; to which no-one within the Jazz FM coverage area would forgive.

====Radio Authority Investigation====
In March 2003 the Radio Authority (embodied into Ofcom, the UK government&#x27;s communications regulator) investigated Jazz FM after it received two complaints from listeners that the station was playing more pop music after changes to the playlist in January 2003. Musicians played on Jazz FM which were alleged to have infringed its licence included U2, Eric Clapton, and Van Morrison. Chris Hodgkins, director of Jazz Service, which is funded by the Arts Council in the UK, stated he would lodge a complaint with the Radio Authority because jazz musicians were being denied airplay due to daytime play of soul and smooth jazz.

Jazz FM was cleared by the Radio Authority of any breach in June 2003. By the end of the investigation, it was revealed that fifteen people had complained that Jazz FM was not playing enough jazz.

==Jingles, slogans, and branding==
British jazz singer Kay Garner was asked by Dave Lee, founder of Jazz FM, to sing jingles for the station when it began in 1990. Jazz FM has had other jingles and slogan. The most well known was the &quot;Listen in Colour&quot; (featuring the Jazz FM chameleon) strapline, poster advertising campaign and CD in January 1997. The campaign was created by the Willox Ambler Rodford Law advertising agency. The campaign was credited with a 48% increase in RAJAR listening figures from 437,000 to 650,000 in the last quarter of 1997. Later in 2002 a poster campaign by WARL was started with the chameleon peering through a misted window with the tagline &quot;Come into the Cool&quot;. Other slogans include &quot;The Rhythm of the City&quot; and afterwards, during the GMG era, &quot;Get It On&quot; created by Kitcatt Nohr Alexander Shaw, though on-air it was swiftly replaced by &quot;Smooth Jazz and Classic Soul&quot;. The £5 million relaunch with Manning Gottlieb over three years from 2003 brought an end to the Jazz FM chameleon because extensive research carried out by GMG Radio found that few people could associate and recall the chameleon with Jazz FM. The Bespoke Music Company created the Jazz FM jingles which were in use since 1 January 2003, until 102.2 Jazz FM was relaunched as 102.2 Smooth FM.

==Availability==
As well as broadcasting on FM in London, Jazz FM was made available on digital radio in the United Kingdom via the Sky Digital platform on 30 April 2002 and on the Freeview platform on 30 October 2002. Both were preceded by test transmissions. Jazz FM was available on DAB digital radio on MXR multiplexes in England, South Wales, and Central Scotland (excluding MXR North West, which hosted the defunct 100.4 Jazz FM service for the North West) and the Switch Digital multiplex covering Greater London. Jazz FM was broadcast around the world on the Internet through its website.

==Jazz FM events==
Jazz FM Events specialised in setting up and providing events based on jazz and soul. This included concerts and performances in bars in the UK.

==Jazz FM connections==
Jazz FM Connections was a dating site run by People2People.com. The service required an individual to pay a subscription to chat and meet people registered on the service. The service continued as Smooth FM Connections and later became Smooth Soulmates.

==Bring a Pound to Work Day==
Jazz FM, like its counterpart GMG radio stations, held &#x27;Bring a Pound to Work Day&#x27; in late October/early November 2003/2004. Listeners were asked to donate and collect pound coins for a local children&#x27;s charity – Nordoff-Robbins in 2003 and the Lennox Children&#x27;s Cancer Fund the following year. Listeners could also text message for donations at a cost of £1.50, of which £1 went to the charity. Jazz FM has held auctions to raise money for charity.

Jazzfm employee Mark Doyle created and marketed many of the later Jazz FM compilations and created the Hed Kandi label, running and compiling the albums until his departure in 2005. From 2000 Hed Kandi began to market events appearing at nightclubs around the world. The most successful events were the residencies in Ibiza at El Divino and at Pacha in London. Hed Kandi also started the record labels Stereo Sushi &amp; The Acid Lounge and had with Stonebridge. In November 2001, Ministry of Sound and Jazz FM plc made a deal whereby Ministry of Sound would distribute all Jazz FM records. Jazz FM Records was renamed Enterprise Records, which in turn was bought by the Ministry of Sound record label from GMG for an undisclosed sum in January 2006. However, under plans to relaunch jazzfm.com as Jazz FM, the Jazz FM Records label was brought back.

<text>Messier 110, or M110, also known as NGC 205, is a dwarf elliptical galaxy that is a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy in the Local Group. 

==Early observational history==
Charles Messier never included the galaxy in his list, but it was depicted by him, together with M32, on his drawing of &quot;Nébuleuse D&#x27;Andromède&quot;, later known as the Andromeda Galaxy. A label of the drawing indicates that Messier first saw the object in 1773. M110 was independently discovered by Caroline Herschel on August 27, 1783; her brother William Herschel described her discovery in 1785. The suggestion to assign the galaxy a Messier number was made by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967, making it the last member of the Messier List.

==Properties==
This galaxy has a morphological classification of pec dE5, indicating a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a flattening of 50%. It is designated peculiar (pec) due to patches of dust and young blue stars near its center. This is unusual for dwarf elliptical galaxies in general, and the reason is unclear. Unlike M32, M110 lacks evidence for a supermassive black hole at its center.

The interstellar dust in M110 has a mass of with a temperature of , and the interstellar gas has . The inner region has sweeping deficiencies in its interstellar medium IM, most likely expelled by supernova explosions. Tidal interactions with M31 may have stripped away a significant fraction of the expelled gas and dust, leaving the galaxy as a whole, as it presents, deficient in its IM density.

Novae have been detected in this galaxy, including one discovered in 1999, and another in 2002. The latter, designated EQ J004015.8+414420, had also been captured in images taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that October.

==Local context==
About half of the Andromeda&#x27;s satellite galaxies are orbiting it in a plane, with 14 out of 16 following the same sense of rotation. One theory proposes that these 16 once belonged to a subhalo surrounding M110, then the group was broken up by tidal forces during a close encounter with Andromeda.

<text>The Goya Awards () are Spain&#x27;s main national annual film awards. They are presented by the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences of Spain.

The first ceremony was held in 1987, a year after the founding of the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences, at the Teatro Lope de Vega in Madrid. They have since been also held in other Spanish cities (Barcelona, Seville, Málaga, Valencia, Valladolid, and Granada).

== History ==
To reward the best Spanish films of each year, the Spanish Academy of Motion Pictures and Arts decided to create the Goya Awards. The Goya Awards are Spain&#x27;s main national film awards, considered by many in Spain, and internationally, to be the Spanish equivalent of the American Academy Awards. The inaugural ceremony took place on March 17, 1987, at the Lope de Vega theatre in Madrid. From the 2nd edition until 1995, the awards were held at the Palacio de Congresos in the Paseo de la Castellana. Then they moved to the similarly named Palacio Municipal de Congresos, also in Madrid. In 2000, the ceremony took place in Barcelona, at the Barcelona Auditorium. In 2003, a large number of film professionals took advantage of the Goya awards ceremony to express their opposition to the Aznar&#x27;s government support of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In 2004, the AVT (an association against terrorism in Spain) demonstrated against terrorism and ETA, a paramilitary organization of Basque separatists, in front of the Lope de Vega theatre. In 2005, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was the first prime minister in the history of Spain to attend the event. In 2013, the minister of culture and education José Ignacio Wert did not attend, saying he had “other things to do”. Some actors said that this decision reflected the government&#x27;s lack of respect for their profession and industry. The 2019 and 2023 editions of the awards took place in Seville, and in 2020 and 2021 in Málaga.

== Trophy sculpture ==
The award itself is a small bronze bust of Francisco Goya created by the sculptor José Luis Fernández, although the original sculpture for the first edition of the Goyas was by Miguel Ortiz Berrocal. The trophy sculpture is informally known as (plural: ), &#x27;bighead&#x27;.

==Awards==
The awards are currently delivered in 28 categories, excluding the Honorary Goya Award and the International Goya Award, with an increase of up to five nominees per category established for the upcoming 37th edition. There was a maximum of four candidates for each from the 13th Edition (having been three candidates in the first edition, five in the 2nd and 3rd edition and three from the fourth to the twelfth edition) to the 36th edition.

<doc id="975074" wikidata="Q5096318" url="?curid=975074" title="Chicken scratch">
<text>Chicken scratch (also known as waila music) is a kind of dance music developed by the Tohono O&#x27;odham people. The genre evolved out of acoustic fiddle bands in southern Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert. These bands began playing European and Mexican tunes, in styles that include the polka, schottisch and mazurka.

Chicken scratch, however, is at its root an interpretation of norteño music, which is itself a Mexican adaptation of polka. Many chicken scratch bands still play polka songs with a distinctive flourish, and may also play the waltz or conjunto. Chicken scratch dance is based on the &quot;&quot;walking two step&quot; or the &quot;walking polka&quot; and the emphasis is on a very smooth gliding movement&quot;; dancers may also perform the mazurka or the chote, though no matter the style, it is always performed counterclockwise.

Chicken scratch is usually played with a band including alto saxophone, bass, guitar, drums and accordion, though the original style used only percussion, guitar and violin, with the accordion and saxophone added in the 1950s. Its home is the Tohono O&#x27;odham Indian Reservation, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and Gila River Indian Community.

The term &quot;waila&quot; comes from Spanish &quot;bailar&quot;, meaning &quot;to dance&quot;. The term &quot;chicken scratch&quot; comes from a description of traditional Tohono O&#x27;odham dance, which involves kicking the heels high in the air, which supposedly bears a resemblance to a chicken scratching.

The most famous performers are likely the Joaquín Brothers, Los Papagos Molinas with Virgil Molina, and Southern Scratch. The Annual Waila Festival in Tucson, Arizona, is well-known, as is the Rock-A-Bye Music Fest in Casa Grande, Arizona. Canyon Records and Rock-A-Bye Records are the best known labels for the genre.

In 2011, a &quot;Best Waila&quot; category was added to the Native American Music Awards.

<doc id="975076" wikidata="Q104840577" url="?curid=975076" title="Broadway Stores">
<text>Broadway Stores, Inc., was an American retailer based in Southern California. Known through its history as Carter Hawley Hale Stores and Broadway Hale Stores over time, it acquired other retail store chains in regions outside its California home base and became in certain retail sectors a regional and national retailer in the 1970s and 1980s. The company was able to survive takeover attempts in 1984 and 1986, and also a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 1991 by selling off most of its assets until August 1995 when its banks refused to advance enough additional credit in order for the company to be able to pay off suppliers. At that point, the company sold itself to Federated Department Stores for $1.6 billion (~$ in ) with the acquisition being completed on October 12, 1995.

==History==

===Early history===

In 1950, as Los Angeles began to grow in population very rapidly and assumed dominance within the state, the fast-growing The Broadway Department Stores (founded in 1896) based there negotiated an all-stock merger with Hale Bros. Stores, Inc. Edward W. Carter, president of The Broadway, became the president of Broadway-Hale Stores.

The newly enlarged company began to grow aggressively with its Broadway stores expanding south to San Diego in 1961 and east to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1968. A mail order firm named the &quot;Sunset House&quot; was also acquired in 1968. In 1970, the company acquired Emporium-Capwell Co., itself the holding company for Emporium in San Francisco (and suburbs) and Capwell&#x27;s (H.C. Capwell Co.) in Oakland (and suburbs) and keeping their respective names on the stores in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Also in 1969, Broadway-Hale acquired the then 3-unit Neiman Marcus specialty department store, based in Dallas, Texas, and the Walden Book Co. (known more commonly as Waldenbooks) and began to actively grow those businesses, nationwide.

===1970s–1980s===

In 1972, Prentis Hale retired as chairman, Edward Carter assumed the chairmanship and Philip M. Hawley (who started as a women&#x27;s sportswear buyer in 1958) became company president. In 1974, in a news release it states, CHH stated that to reflect the executives&#x27; contributions, the corporate parent was adopting the name Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Inc. The new name was a major tongue twister, and stock analysts sometimes called it &quot;Ego, Inc.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in 1984 that some critics accused Carter and Hawley on being on an &quot;ego trip&quot;. In 1977, Carter retired. Hawley was appointed CEO.

The company continued to be an active acquirer, in 1972 acquiring Bergdorf Goodman in New York, and Holt Renfrew of Montreal, Canada. After attempting an ill-fated, unsuccessful hostile takeover of Marshall Field in 1977, the company acquired the venerable but tattered John Wanamaker&#x27;s of Philadelphia for $60 million (cash) in April 1978. That was followed by a stock swap for Thalhimers of Richmond, Virginia in August 1978. Contempo Casuals was a May 1979, takeover. Emporium and Capwell&#x27;s were merged to form a unified San Francisco Bay-area presence as Emporium-Capwell in 1980, Weinstock&#x27;s moved into Utah and Reno, Nevada, and The Broadway stores were split into separate Los Angeles and Phoenix–based divisions as the chain expanded into Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. Sales increased, but profits did not. The saying on Wall Street was &quot;God gave them Southern California, and they blew it&quot;, which &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; had attributed to Monroe H. Greenstein, a retailing analyst at Bear Stearns.

In 1980, CHH decided to get rid of units which catered to the lower economic markets. The first to go was the Sunset House mail order unit which also operated novelty shops in shopping malls. CHH found a buyer that only wanted the mail order unit and the mall stores were closed in 1981.

Faced with continuing poor results, and two hostile takeover attempts by The Limited in 1984 and 1986, the company, still led by Phillip M. Hawley, reacted by first selling Waldenbooks to Kmart in 1984, Holt Renfrew to the Weston Family in April 1986, Wanamaker&#x27;s to A. Alfred Taubman&#x27;s Woodward &amp; Lothrop in January 1987 and then splitting off the desirable specialty store business as Neiman-Marcus Group, Inc. (encompassing the Neiman-Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals stores). The company that had rescued Carter Hawley Hale from The Limited takeover-attempts, theater owner/soft-drink bottler-cum-investment company General Cinema (later renamed Harcourt General), assumed majority ownership of Neiman-Marcus Group in 1986 as its reward. Thalhimer&#x27;s was sold to May Department Stores in December 1990.

===1990s and the end===
From its heights in 1984 as the sixth-largest department store chain firm in the United States, CHH fell into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1991. Besides the financial problems of surviving the 1980s era of hostile takeovers, the main California department store business had faltered because of increasing competition from Nordstrom.

In 1992, after one and one-half years of bankruptcy negotiations, financier Sam Zell and his Zell/Chilmark Fund completed the reorganization of the newly renamed Broadway Stores, Inc., taking a 75 percent stake. The company finally emerged from bankruptcy in October 1992 and Hawley promptly announced his retirement. In early 1993, the three Utah-based Weinstock&#x27;s stores were closed and the store leases were sold to Mervyns, Dillard&#x27;s, and ZCMI.

After the takeover by Zell, Hawley was replaced as CEO by David Dworkin. Dworkin tried to slow the outward flow of cash from the company by remodeling stores and streamlining operations. In June 1994, the shareholders of &quot;Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Inc.&quot; voted to change the name of the company to Broadway Stores, Inc. to symbolize a change in the ailing company, but it was too late to make a difference.

The final blow came on August 8, 1995, when the firm&#x27;s lenders announced they would not advance the company any additional funds - which were needed to pay suppliers for new, as well as existing inventory. A week later, the firm announced its sale to Federated Department Stores which effectively marked the beginning of the end to the remnant nameplates that the stores had operated under.

The newly streamlined company was short-lived, however. In August 1995, Federated Department Stores agreed to acquire Broadway Stores. The acquisition was completed on October 12. The chain was dissolved in 1996 as Federated consolidated the former Broadway, Emporium and Weinstock&#x27;s stores, along with its own Macy&#x27;s California and Bullock&#x27;s chains (acquired in 1994), to form Macy&#x27;s West. Several duplicative units were sold to Sears or shuttered, while Federated also used the real estate of five stores (Emporium-Capwell Stanford Shopping Center, Broadway Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, Broadway Century City Shopping Center, Broadway Beverly Center, and Broadway Fashion Island Newport Beach) to finally bring its Bloomingdale&#x27;s chain to the West Coast.

On September 28, 2006, Emporium-Capwell&#x27;s Market Street flagship was redeveloped to house another Bloomingdale&#x27;s location as well as an expansion of the adjoining shopping center Westfield San Francisco Centre. In addition, the one-time CHH Corporate Offices in the former Superior Oil Company Building at 550 South Flower Street in Los Angeles, right next door to The California Club (of which Carter and Hawley were members), were converted into a three-star boutique hotel called &quot;The Standard.&quot;

==Selected divisions==

===Broadway===
The Broadway division was the largest department store division within the company. The division could trace its roots to the Broadway Department Store that was founded in Los Angeles by Arthur Letts, Sr. in 1896. By 1992, the division expanded throughout Southern California and started expanded outside of California. In 1979, the division was split into the Phoenix-based Broadway Southwest to handle the out-of-state stores and the Los Angeles–based Broadway Southern California to handle the stores within California. The two separate divisions were consolidated in 1992 after many of the non-Californian stores were closed. At the time of its parent acquisition by Federated, Broadway had 52 stores.

===Hale&#x27;s===
The chain&#x27;s beginnings date from The Criterion store founded in Sacramento, California, in 1880 by the Hale Brothers, Prentis Cobb Hale I and Marshal Hale and adopted their name later the same year. By 1936, scion Prentis Cobb Hale worked as a stock clerk in the family store after he graduated from Stanford University. The company had expanded throughout Northern California, including a location at 989 Market Street in San Francisco by 1902 (replaced in 1912 by a location at 901 Market Street). By 1949, the company had acquired its Sacramento-based rival Weinstock, Lubin &amp; Co. Weinstock&#x27;s was kept as a separate brand. Paradoxically, the Hale brand was later absorbed by the Weinstock&#x27;s brand in Northern California.

===Emporium-Capwell===
Emporium-Capwell was created by the 1927 merger of the San Francisco–based Emporium Company and the Oakland-based H.C. Capwell Company. This company kept the two brands separate and had opened many Emporium and Capwell stores respectively throughout the San Francisco Bay Area prior to its acquisition by Broadway-Hale in 1970. Under Carter Hawley Hale, there were 12 Emporiums and six Capwell stores when the two brands were merged to form the single Emporium-Capwell brand in 1980. There were 22 Emporium-Capwell stores left at the time of its parent&#x27;s acquisition by Federated.

===Weinstock&#x27;s===
Weinstock&#x27;s could trace its origins to the Sacramento-based Weinstock, Lubin &amp; Co. There were 8 Weinstock&#x27;s store left at the time of its parent&#x27;s acquisition by Federated.

==ERISA case==
Carter Hawley Hale also is known as a famous case study regarding its retirement plans. Because it offered its employees a profit-sharing plan, and not a retirement fund, under the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pension plan law, the trustee was under no obligation to diversify the fund. Because of the nondiversification and continued purchase of Carter Hawley Hale stock, the employee fund soon was stuck with a precipitous loss in value. Its employees&#x27; low morale contributed to its problems.

==Advertising==
The longtime print and television-radio media advertising slogans during the 1970s until The Broadway closed for good were &quot;It&#x27;s at the Broadway&quot; (radio and television only) and &quot;The Broadway &quot;is&quot; Southern California&quot; (all media). A baritone male voice-over announcer provided the verbalized slogan.

<doc id="975083" wikidata="Q2457724" url="?curid=975083" title="Lake of Fire (song)">
<text>&quot;Lake of Fire&quot; is a song by the American alternative rock band the Meat Puppets, written by vocalist and guitarist, Curt Kirkwood. It appears on their second album, &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;, released in April 1984. An alternate version appeared as a hidden track on their 1994 album, &quot;Too High to Die&quot;.

The song gained widespread exposure when it was covered, along with two other songs from &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;, by American rock band Nirvana during their &quot;MTV Unplugged &quot; appearance in November 1993. All three songs during the performance featured Curt on guitar and his brother and Meat Puppets bassist Cris Kirkwood on bass and backing vocals.

&quot;Lake of Fire&quot; has been performed at the majority of Meat Puppets concerts, as well as at most of Curt Kirkwood&#x27;s solo shows.

==Background==

Curt Kirkwood said, &quot;I lived with [bandmates] Cris and Derrick, and probably Cris&#x27; girlfriend, Kelly. ... They went to a Halloween party and I was disgruntled because I thought it was nonsense that adults should callously attempt to alter their appearances, that we are already sufficiently foul. ... I was younger then. I just said, &#x27;Talk about man&#x27;s fall from grace. This is it.&#x27;&quot; He also described the song as a &quot;toss-off&quot; and a &quot;cartoon&quot;.

==Promo single==

The &quot;Too High to Die&quot; version was released as a promotional single, and featured three versions of the song.

&quot;Lake of Fire&quot; was one of three songs from &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;, alongside &quot;Plateau&quot; and &quot;Oh, Me,&quot; covered by Nirvana during their &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance on November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios in New York City. All three songs featured Nirvana vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain on lead vocals, Curt Kirkwood on lead guitar, Cris Kirkwood on bass and backing vocals, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic on rhythm guitar, and Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl on drums. The show was first broadcast in December 1993, and aired numerous times following Cobain&#x27;s suicide in April 1994. It was released as an album, &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, in November 1994, which opened at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="975090" wikidata="Q2916376" url="?curid=975090" title="January effect">
<text>The January effect is a hypothesis that there is a seasonal anomaly in the financial market where securities&#x27; prices increase in the month of January more than in any other month. This calendar effect would create an opportunity for investors to buy stocks for lower prices before January and sell them after their value increases. As with all calendar effects, if true, it would suggest that the market is not efficient, as market efficiency would suggest that this effect should disappear.

The effect was first observed around 1942 by investment banker Sidney B. Wachtel. He noted that since 1925 small stocks had outperformed the broader market in the month of January, with most of the disparity occurring before the middle of the month. It has also been noted that when combined with the four-year US presidential cycle, historically the largest January effect occurs in year three of a president&#x27;s term.

The most common theory explaining this phenomenon is that individual investors, who are income tax-sensitive and who disproportionately hold small stocks, sell stocks for tax reasons at year end (such as to claim a capital loss) and reinvest after the first of the year. Another cause is the payment of year-end bonuses in January. Some of this bonus money is used to purchase stocks, driving up prices. The January effect does not always materialize; for example, small stocks underperformed large stocks in 1982, 1987, 1989 and 1990.

==Criticism==
Burton Malkiel asserts that seasonal anomalies such as the January Effect are transient and do not present investors with reliable arbitrage opportunities. He sums up his critique of the January Effect:Wall Street traders now joke that the January effect is more likely to occur on the previous Thanksgiving. Moreover, these nonrandom effects (even if they were dependable) are very small relative to the transaction costs involved in trying to exploit them. They do not appear to offer arbitrage opportunities that would enable investors to make excess risk adjusted returns.

<text>Gerry Finley-Day (born 1947, in Broughty Ferry, Dundee) is a Scottish comics writer, prolific from the 1960s to the 1980s, best known as the creator of &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot;.

==Career==

He began his career at D.C. Thomson &amp; Co., before becoming the editor of IPC Media&#x27;s girls&#x27; title &quot;Tammy&quot; in 1971, for which he wrote strips such as &quot;Ella on Easy Street&quot; and &quot;The Camp on Candy Island&quot;. Tammy&#x27;s stories were full of cruelty and adversity, based on research showing that girls wanted stories that made them cry.

Finley-Day rose to become deputy managing editor of IPC&#x27;s girls&#x27; comics department, but quit to become a freelance writer. In 1974 he was drafted in by Pat Mills to help develop characters for &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;, launched the following year, for which he wrote &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, &quot;The Sarge&quot;, &quot;The Bootneck Boy&quot;, &quot;D-Day Dawson&quot;, &quot;Return of the Eagle&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Without Stripes&quot;, &quot;Cold Steele&quot;, &quot;Skreamer of the Stukas&quot;, &quot;Glory Rider&quot;, &quot;Cooley&#x27;s Gun&quot;, &quot;Action Force&quot;, &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot; and many others. He had a penchant for creating honourable German heroes, including &quot;Fighter from the Sky&quot;, &quot;Panzer G-Man&quot;, &quot;Commando King&quot;, &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;, and perhaps the best known, &quot;Hellman of Hammer Force&quot;, which started out in &quot;Action&quot; and transferred to &quot;Battle&quot; after &quot;Action&quot; was merged into it. Other strips he wrote for &quot;Action&quot; include &quot;Green&#x27;s Grudge War&quot; and &quot;Dredger&quot;.

Finley-Day was one of the mainstays of early &quot;2000 AD&quot;, writing &quot;Invasion!&quot;, &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, &quot;Fiends of the Eastern Front&quot;, and a couple of early episodes of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, and became their specialist in future war stories, first with &quot;The V.C.s&quot;, and then his most enduring character, &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot;, which still features occasionally, written by other writers — although Finley-Day returned to the character for a one-off story in 2010. He also wrote &quot;Blackhawk&quot; for &quot;Tornado&quot;, and several strips for the revived &quot;Eagle&quot;, including &quot;Saddle Tramp&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Streetwise&quot;, &quot;Jake&#x27;s Platoon&quot;, &quot;The Hand&quot;, and episodes of &quot;The Collector&quot;. In August 2022, Rebellion published &quot;The Best of Gerry Finley-Day&quot; with a short UK booking signing tour at Forbidden Planet shops. The book includes the full &quot;Harry 20 on the High Rock&quot; as well as excerpts from &quot;Dan Dare&quot; and the &quot;V.C.s&quot;

<text>Gerald Brooks Hunt Solomon (August 14, 1930 – October 26, 2001) was an American businessman and politician most notable for his long service as a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York.

A veteran of the United States Marine Corps and the Marine Corps Reserve, and a successful insurance and investment broker, Solomon entered politics as a Democrat when he was elected town supervisor of Queensbury in 1968. He became a Republican in his first term, and won election to the New York State Assembly as a Republican in 1972.

After three terms in the Assembly, Solomon won election to the U.S. House. He became a high-profile advocate on defense and veterans&#x27; issues, and was best known for passage of his Solomon Amendment, which prohibited federal funding to colleges and universities that banned military recruiters from their campuses. After Republicans won control of the House in the 1994 elections, Solomon challenged Newt Gingrich for Speaker, but withdrew when it became clear that Gingrich had the support of a majority of the Republican caucus. Solomon became chairman of the House Rules Committee, a post he held from 1995 until retiring from the House in 1999. He was succeeded by fellow Republican John E. Sweeney.

After leaving Congress, Solomon operated a lobbying and strategic consulting firm. He died in Queensbury on October 26, 2001. He was buried at the national veteran&#x27;s cemetery in Schuylerville, New York; he had spearheaded efforts to create the facility, which was named in his honor after his death.

==Early life==
Solomon was born in Okeechobee, Florida, the son of Eugenia and Daniel Hunt. He was raised by his mother and stepfather, Seymour Solomon, and his family moved to New York when he was 15. He attended school in Florida and Delmar, New York, and graduated from Delmar&#x27;s Bethlehem Central High School in 1948. He attended Siena College from 1949 to 1950 and St. Lawrence University from 1953 to 1954.

==Start of career==
===Military service===
Solomon attempted to join the 1st Engineer Company of the United States Marine Corps Reserve in Albany, New York during the Korean War in 1950, but was deemed ineligible because of a childhood illness. He tried to enlist again in 1951 and was accepted. From 1951 to 1952, Solomon was a radio operator assigned to the 2nd Marine Division and stationed aboard the helicopter carrier USS &quot;Siboney&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean, and he attained the rank of private first class. He remained in the Marine Corps Reserve until 1959, and attained the rank of lance corporal.

===Businessman===
In the 1950s and 1960s Solomon was involved with M. Solomon, the women&#x27;s clothing business owned by his stepfather. In the mid-1960s, he became a partner in the Associates of Glens Falls insurance company, as well as a partner in the Anchor Realty real estate brokerage. In addition he was president of Solomon, Veysey, Dixon, Gohn Associates, an investment brokerage. He also served as president of Queensbury&#x27;s merchants association, and a member of the board of directors of the Glens Falls chamber of commerce. He was active in the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts, and was also involved in several charitable and civic causes. In addition, his fraternal memberships included the Marine Corps League, Masons, Shriners, and American Legion. The name recognition derived from his business and civic accomplishments provided Solomon with an entrée into local politics and government.

==Early political career==
Originally a Democrat, In 1967, Solomon defeated incumbent John O. Webster to become Queensbury&#x27;s Town Supervisor, which also made him a member of the Warren County Board of Supervisors. He was reelected in 1971 and served from January 1968 to December 1972, when he was succeeded by John A. DeLong Jr. In February 1968 he switched his party affiliation to Republican, arguing that he had been a Republican prior to the election of John F. Kennedy, that he joined the Democrats because he was inspired by Kennedy&#x27;s goals and vision, but that he was returning to the Republicans because he perceived that Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s presidency had moved too far from Kennedy&#x27;s agenda. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1973 to 1978, sitting in the 180th, 181st and 182nd New York State Legislatures. As a fiscal conservative and advocate for limited government, Solomon was often at odds with the Assembly&#x27;s Democratic majority.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In November 1978, Solomon was elected to the House of Representatives. In 1980, he was an early and avid supporter of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign, and remained a Reagan stalwart, supporting his efforts to reduce taxes, revive the economy, halt Soviet expansionism and rebuild America&#x27;s defenses. Solomon supported the line-item veto, a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, a repeal of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and amendments that strengthened the Selective Service System. He was such an opponent of gun control that he once challenged fellow Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island to &quot;step outside&quot; to settle a dispute over the issue. Solomon attempted to run for Speaker of the House in 1994 but withdrew in favor of Newt Gingrich.

Solomon also supported creation of the Saratoga National Cemetery, which was named the Gerald B. H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery in his honor following his death. In addition, he was a longtime advocate of elevating the Veterans Administration to cabinet status, which resulted in creation of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Solomon was also a leader of former Marines in Congress who fought the construction of the United States Air Force Memorial through litigation and legislation at a site they considered to be too close to the USMC War Memorial. (The Air Force Memorial was ultimately constructed at a different location, on the grounds of Fort Myer near Arlington National Cemetery.)

===Solomon Amendment===
Solomon was also the originator and sponsor of the Solomon Amendment, a controversial amendment to United States Code that precluded the receipt of federal government funds by colleges and universities unless they provided equal access to military recruiters as they did private employers. The policy was a response to rules at many American law schools which excluded employers who discriminated based on categories such as sexual orientation. The Amendment was subject to extensive litigation in 2003 by plaintiffs; the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights (FAIR) and the Society of American Law Teachers. This litigation included &quot;FAIR v. Rumsfeld&quot;, 390 F.3d 219 (3rd Cir. 2004). On March 6, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the military and upheld the Solomon Amendment.

===Rules Committee Chair===
Solomon was named ranking Republican of the House Rules Committee in 1991. Even though Jimmy Quillen of Tennessee had far more seniority, the other Republicans on the committee thought Solomon was a more accomplished legislator. When he lost his bid for the Speakership in 1995, he became chairman of the Rules Committee, thus making him one of the three or four most powerful members of the House. He served as chairman from 1995 to 1999, when he retired.

In his district, which ran from the Hudson Valley near Poughkeepsie into the Adirondacks, including Lake Placid, he was a popular and respected figure. In the later years of his tenure he consistently drew the highest total vote of any member of the New York delegation. He was well known for his strong constituent work, and for facilitating federal investment in his mostly rural district, including dozens of housing projects for low income elderly.

After leaving Congress he formed the Solomon Group, a Washington consulting and lobbying business.

==Death and burial==
On October 26, 2001, Solomon died of congestive heart failure at his home in Queensbury at the age of 71. His ability to maintain friendships across political lines resulted in several Democratic members of Congress attending his funeral, including Representative Charles Rangel, a fellow veteran. Solomon was buried at the national cemetery which is named for him.

==Family==
In 1955 Solomon married Freda Parker of Monongahela, Pennsylvania. They were the parents of five children, Susan, Daniel, Robert, Linda and Jeffrey. In addition to his wife and children, Solomon was survived by six grandchildren and his brother Richard.

<text>Wrexham University (; ) is a public university in the north-east of Wales, with campuses in Wrexham, Northop and St Asaph. It offers both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as professional courses. The university had students in .

The earliest predecessor of the university was the Wrexham School of Science and Art (WSSA), established in 1887, which after several mergers became the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education (NEWI) in 1975. The institute became a full member of the University of Wales in 2004. In 2008 it was granted full university status and renamed Glyndŵr University () after Owain Glyndŵr, a fifteenth-century Welsh leader who was born near Wrexham and suggested the establishment of universities in Wales. The term &quot;Wrexham&quot; was later added to the existing name in 2016, until the university adopted its current name in late 2023.

The university&#x27;s School of Creative Arts operates the Wall Recording Studio on its Plas Coch campus, the former home of Calon FM community radio station.

==History==
The university&#x27;s origins date back to the opening of Wrexham School of Science and Art (WSSA) in 1887. At this time John Viriamu Jones called for a University of Wales. The WSSA began offering University of London-validated degrees in science in 1924. The original name of Wrexham School of Science and Art was changed several times. In 1927, it became Denbighshire Technical Institute, becoming Denbighshire Technical College in 1939 and North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in 1975 by the merger of Denbighshire Technical College, Cartrefle Teacher Training College and Kelsterton College of Connah&#x27;s Quay, Deeside. Initially, its degrees were validated by the University of Salford. Some famous alumni include Andrew Gwynne (when it was North East Wales Institute of Higher Education), Gavin Roberts, and Brian Percival (as North Wales School of Art and Design).

In 1993, NEWI became an associate member of the University of Wales and all further education courses in Wrexham were moved to Yale College, Wrexham (now part of Coleg Cambria). In 2004, NEWI became a full member of the University of Wales, with &quot;University of Wales, Wrexham&quot; touted as a potential future name, and in 2006 became accredited by the University of Wales and exercised devolved powers to validate and deliver its own degrees. The university was officially renamed &quot;Glyndŵr University&quot; in July 2008 after being granted degree awarding powers. The university was visited by the Queen in 2003 and by Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester in 2005.

In June 2014, the Home Office suspended the University&#x27;s authorisation to sponsor international students.

On 24 November 2014 Glyndŵr University has had its right to sponsor international students reinstated by the Home Office.

In 2016, the university underwent a minor name change and is now called &quot;Wrexham Glyndŵr University&quot; in English, and &quot;Prifysgol Glyndŵr Wrecsam&quot; in Welsh.

Between 2008 and 2019, the main Wrexham campus of the University hosted Wales Comic Con, reduced to one-day events from 2022 following a brief absence.

In August 2022, the university announced it was considering re-naming itself to &quot;Wrexham University&quot; () dropping &quot;Glyndŵr&quot; from its name. On 27 April 2023, the university confirmed its plans to rename to &quot;Wrexham University&quot;, following consultations with staff, students and other organisations, and approval by the Privy Council. The Privy Council legally changed the name of the university on 9 February 2023. The university stated the increased attention of Wrexham due to Wrexham A.F.C., Welcome to Wrexham and Wrexham&#x27;s awarded city status, as reasons for the move. The university also made plans to &quot;continue celebrat[ing] [Glyndŵr&#x27;s] legacy&quot;. The name change became official in September 2023, and the university maintains links with the Owain Glyndŵr Society to offer one of its top graduate awards.

==Campuses==
The university has various sites in Wrexham and north east Wales. From 2011 to 2018 it ran a campus in London.

===Wrexham===

The university has two sites in Wrexham. The main site at Plas Coch covers , and was inherited from the former Cartrefle TTC which moved there in 1953. It houses over 70 seminar suites, conference suites, lecture theatres, workshops and laboratories, complemented with a library (the Edward Llwyd Centre) and learning resource facilities, as well as a sports centre, a Centre for the Creative Industries, the Centre for the Child, Family and Society, the Glyndŵr University Racecourse Stadium, a human performance lab, the Terry Hands studio, the Catrin Finch Centre, William Aston Hall, the Oriel Sycharth Gallery and the Welsh international hockey team.

The educational charity North Wales Science, owned by the university, operated a science discovery centre on the Plas Coch campus. The centre was open to schools and the general public, and in a partnership with Techniquest in Cardiff, was branded as &#x27;Techniquest@NEWI&#x27; and later &#x27;Techniquest Glyndŵr&#x27;, from 2003 to 2020. In 2019, the charity decided to relocate to a site in Wrexham city centre, with their Henblas Street site opening on 3 October 2020, rebranding as &#x27;Xplore! Science Discovery Centre&#x27;.

The other Wrexham site on Regent Street, is near to Wrexham city centre and is home to its North Wales School of Art and Design (NWSAD). It formerly housed the Denbighshire Technical College, who moved to the site in 1927 (under their previous name of Denbighshire Technical Institute).
In 2011, the university acquired the Racecourse Ground, the home of Wrexham FC, renaming it the &quot;Glyndŵr University Racecourse Stadium&quot;. The university sold the stadium back to the club on 29 June 2022.

The university has its own music recording facilities, notably The Wall Recording Studio.

===Northop===

The university shares the former Welsh College of Horticulture in Northop, Flintshire, with Coleg Cambria.

==Academic profile==

The university runs 150 programmes, offering foundation, HND/Cs, honours and master&#x27;s degrees and doctorates over a broad variety of qualifications. In addition to professional courses such as nursing and social work, the university offers a range of postgraduate and undergraduate qualifications in Art &amp; Design, Engineering, Science, Humanities, Health and Social Care, Criminology and Criminal Justice, Sports Sciences, Computing and Communication Technology, Music technology and Business. Although all courses are offered in English there are options to study or to be assessed in Welsh. A foundation degree in professional Welsh is also available.

==Administration==
WGU&#x27;s first principal (then as NEWI) was Glyn O. Phillips. He retired in 1991 and was replaced by John O. Williams. Following the retirement of Williams in 2000, NEWI appointed Michael Scott, a former student of the University of Wales, Lampeter in 2001. He was succeeded by Professor Graham Upton in January 2015 who served as interim Vice-Chancellor until 31 March 2016. The current Vice-Chancellor is Professor Maria Hinfelaar who was the President of the Limerick Institute of Technology.

<doc id="975102" wikidata="Q271846" url="?curid=975102" title="Margaret Avery">
<text>Margaret Avery is an American actress. She began her career appearing on stage and later had starring roles in films including &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; (1972), &quot;Which Way Is Up?&quot; (1977), &quot;Scott Joplin&quot; (1977) which earned her an NAACP Image Award nomination, and &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot; (1979). She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Shug Avery in the period drama film &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985).

Avery continued appearing in films like &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; (1988), &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; (1995), &quot;Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins&quot; (2008), &quot;Meet the Browns&quot; (2008), and &quot;Proud Mary&quot; (2018). From 2013 to 2019, Avery starred as Helen Patterson, lead character&#x27;s mother, in the BET drama series &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Margaret Avery grew up in San Diego and attended high school at the Point Loma High School in the city. She earned a degree in education in 1965 from San Francisco State University. While working as an elementary school teacher in Oakland, California, she began making singing and acting appearances. She studied with Judy Davis, the vocal coach for Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand as well as at the American Conservatory Theater. She moved to Los Angeles in 1968 to pursue acting full time, while working as a substitute teacher.

==Career==

=== Early roles ===
Among the plays Avery appeared in were &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;The Sistuhs&quot;. In 1972, she received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress for her performance in &quot;Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;. In the television movie &quot;Something Evil&quot; (1972), a horror story with Sandy Dennis and Darren McGavin, Avery was directed by Steven Spielberg. In the same year she made her theatrical motion picture debut as Lark in the crime film &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; with Thalmus Rasulala and Judy Pace. In this blaxploitation remake of &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;, Avery played the Marilyn Monroe part. The next year she played a prostitute in &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, the second in the series of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films starring Clint Eastwood, in which her character was murdered by her pimp. The character was killed by pouring drain cleaner down the victim&#x27;s throat, which was said to have inspired the notorious Hi-Fi murders case in Ogden, Utah in 1974.

Avery received an NAACP Image Award for her performance in the 1976 film &quot;Louis Armstrong - Chicago Style&quot;. In the 1977 film &quot;Which Way Is Up?&quot;, directed by Michael Schultz, Avery gave a comedic performance as Annie Mae, the wife of Richard Pryor&#x27;s character. That same year, she played Belle Joplin, wife of the ragtime composer Scott Joplin, opposite Billy Dee Williams in the title role in film &quot;Scott Joplin&quot;, receiving an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture nomination. In 1979, she appeared in &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;.

Avery made guest appearances on many television series during 1970s and 1980s including &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, five appearances on &quot;Harry O&quot;, &quot;A.E.S. Hudson Street&quot;, &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

=== &quot;The Color Purple&quot; ===
In 1985, Avery played the role of Shug Avery in the period drama film &quot;The Color Purple&quot; directed by Steven Spielberg. Her performance in this screen adaptation of Alice Walker&#x27;s prize-winning novel &quot;The Color Purple&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Avery was the last character to be cast in the film. In her &quot;Essence&quot; interview she said: &quot;I had been singing in Indonesia and came back to find all these messages on my answering service from other actors saying, ‘Hey Margaret, you’ve got to get your agent on The Color Purple.’ My agent at the time had tried to get me an audition but was told that I wasn&#x27;t right for the role— they wanted a singer, not an actor. I knew Ruben Cannon, who was casting at that time, because he&#x27;d cast me in so many television things before, so I wrote him a note. I had read the book and was drawn to Shug Avery. Ruben allowed me to put my reading for the role on tape. Because of him, I was able to get my work seen by Steven Spielberg. Alice Walker said that she had seen a lot of tapes of other actors, but when my audition came up, she just kind of woke up. She couldn&#x27;t take her eyes off me. That was like a beautiful introduction to getting the role.&quot;

After &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and Oscar nomination, Avery did not work on film or television for two years. She said, &quot;The fact that I didn’t work for a couple years after &quot;The Color Purple&quot; is not unique. It not only happens to White actors sometimes, but with Black actors, too, but more so for women of color. At the time, most women of color who were in the business were limited to Black film; whereas my counterpart like Danny Glover, went on to&quot; Lethal Weapon One, Two,&quot; and &quot;Three&quot;. He didn’t have to be limited to a Black film; he didn’t have to be married to a family, or related to somebody, like we women have to. I didn’t work for a couple years after &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. What saved me was the college lecture circuit. I kind of got a backlash for two reasons; one, no one would even think of me for a television role because they figured she’s too big to do TV now. That was the pattern.&quot;

=== Subsequent work ===
In 1988, Avery starred in the period drama film &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, and the following year appeared in action film &quot;Riverbend&quot;. In 1990, she appeared in &quot;The Return of Superfly&quot;, another blaxploitation film. In 1992, she starred in the ABC miniseries &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot; as Martha Scruse, mother of Katherine Jackson, who was played by Angela Bassett. In 1995, she co-starred opposite Harry Belafonte in the drama film &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;. The following years, she guest-starred on number of television series, including &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, and &quot;Bones&quot;. In 2008, Avery played Mama Jenkins in &quot;Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins&quot;, opposite Martin Lawrence and James Earl Jones, and Sarah Brown in Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Browns&quot;, which also stars Angela Bassett.

From 2013 to 2019, Avery played the role of Helen Patterson in the BET drama series, &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;. She played Taraji P. Henson&#x27; mother in the 2018 action film &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. She later guest-starred on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Better Things&quot;.

==Personal life==
Avery lives in Los Angeles and remains active in show business. Continuing to act, she also works with at-risk teenagers and battered women of the greater Los Angeles area. She holds a master&#x27;s in psychology degree from the Phillips Graduate University, and worked as a psychotherapist for the Los Angeles Unified School District. She was interviewed by Melody Trice on &quot;The Melody Trice Show &quot;about her activism. She is a spokesperson for the Lupus Foundation of America.

<text>Donald Johnson Ellis (July 25, 1934 – December 17, 1978) was an American jazz trumpeter, drummer, composer, and bandleader. He is best known for his extensive musical experimentation, particularly in the area of time signatures. Later in his life he worked as a film composer, contributing a score to 1971&#x27;s &quot;The French Connection&quot; and 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ellis was born in Los Angeles, California, on July 25, 1934. His father was a Methodist minister and his mother a church organist. He attended West High School in Minneapolis, MN. After attending a Tommy Dorsey Big Band concert, he first became interested in jazz. Other early inspirations were Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie. He graduated from Boston University in 1956 with a music composition degree.

==Early career==
Ellis&#x27;s first job was with the late Glenn Miller&#x27;s band, then directed by Ray McKinley. He stayed with the band until September 1956, when he joined the U.S. Army&#x27;s Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra and the &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Show Company.&quot; Ellis was transferred to Frankfurt, Germany for duty. In the Army band, Ellis met pianist Cedar Walton, and saxophonists Eddie Harris and Don Menza. While in that band Ellis had his first opportunity to compose and arrange for a big band.

After two years, Don Ellis left the Army band and moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. He was able to get some work, but mainly with dance bands and other local work. He toured briefly with bandleader Charlie Barnet and joined the Maynard Ferguson band in spring of 1959. He remained with Ferguson for nine months.

==The New York Avant-Garde ==
Shortly thereafter, Ellis became involved in the New York City avant-garde jazz scene. He appeared on albums by Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, and George Russell, working in that sextet for two years. Under his own name, Ellis led several sessions with small groups between 1960 and 1962, which featured, among others, Jaki Byard, Paul Bley, Gary Peacock, Ron Carter, Charlie Persip, and Steve Swallow. The last one, &quot;Essence&quot;, was recorded in mid-July 1962.

On 3 June 1962, Ellis performed the jazz liturgy &quot;Evensong&quot;, composed by Edgar Summerlin. The performance took place at the First International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C., and was broadcast on &quot;Look Up and Live&quot; on 12 August, 1962. Ellis performed alongside Lou Gluckin on trumpet, J. R. Monterose on tenor saxophone, Eric Dolphy on flute, Slide Hampton on trombone, Dick Lieb on bass trombone, Barry Galbraith on guitar, Ron Carter on bass, and Charlie Persip on drums.

==Europe and America==
In October 1962, Ellis traveled to Poland to take part in the 1962 Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw; his quartet performance was partially documented on a Polish-only 10-inch EP. Ellis chronicled his experience in an article called &quot;Warsaw Diary&quot;, which was printed in the January 3rd, 1963 issue of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine. In December, Ellis participated in the NDR Jazz Workshop in Hamburg, Germany, and in early 1963, traveled to Stockholm, Sweden. While there, he became somewhat well known for his experimentation with happenings, similar to those used by members of the Fluxus art movement.

Back in New York, Ellis formed the Improvisational Workshop Orchestra, which gave its debut performance on February 10, 1963 at the Five Spot. (Another tape of the same group is listed in the Don Ellis Collection as being recorded on Feb. 9th, but it may be a rehearsal tape.) The performance had a quality similar to those Ellis gave in Sweden: unusual artistic devices were employed, such as performers using cards to determine event orders, and musicians using their instruments to interpret a painter&#x27;s work. Some uncommon musical elements were employed, such as the use of Arabian rhythms and scales, and foot shuffling.

== New Rhythms and the Third Stream ==
In 1964, Ellis began graduate studies in ethnomusicology at UCLA where he studied with Indian musician Harihar Rao. Greatly inspired by Rao, Ellis sought to implement odd meters in a Western improvised context and (with Rao) co-authored the 1965 article &quot;An Introduction to Indian Music for the Jazz Musician&quot;. Ellis briefly formed the first version of his big band at this time but disbanded it when he received a Rockefeller Grant to work at SUNY Buffalo for a year.

While in New York, Ellis was involved with several Third Stream projects. A live performance from February 8, 1964, at the Lincoln Center was filmed for Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot; series. He performed with other jazz musicians alongside the New York Philharmonic on Larry Austin&#x27;s &quot;Improvisations for Orchestra and Jazz Soloists&quot; (1961) and Gunther Schuller&#x27;s &quot;Journey Into Jazz&quot; (1962). A later recording of Austin&#x27;s piece, featuring Ellis, bassist Barre Phillips, drummer Joe Cocuzzo, and the New York Philharmonic (directed by Bernstein) was released on an album entitled &quot;Leonard Bernstein Conducts Music Of Our Time&quot; (1965).

In November 1967, Ellis&#x27;s first symphony, &quot;Contrasts for Two Orchestras and Trumpet&quot;, was debuted by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta.

==The Hindustani Jazz Sextet==
Returning to the West Coast, Ellis formed The Hindustani Jazz Sextet, which explored some of the concepts he had learned at UCLA. The Sextet is generally considered to be the first band of its kind in America. The Sextet centered on Ellis and his mentor Harihar Rao, who played sitar and tabla, but also featured vibraphonist Emil Richards, drummer Steve Bohannon, bassists Chuck Domanico and Ray Neapolitan, and pianist Dave Mackay. At least one performance also featured saxophonist Gabe Baltazar. The band performed mainly original compositions which had titles like &quot;Sweet Nineteen&quot;, &quot;Turks Works&quot;, and &quot;Bombay Bossa Nova&quot;.

The Sextet became somewhat well known around Los Angeles, despite having no recordings commercially available. Perhaps the greatest exposure the group had was &quot;Synthesis&quot;, a composition by Ellis in which the Sextet performed alongside Stan Kenton&#x27;s Neophonic Orchestra. The concert took place in February 1966 at the Los Angeles Music Center.

On July 14 of that year, the Sextet performed at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium, opening for the Grateful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company. This is the last known activity of the Sextet, until 1971, when the group (with Milcho Leviev, Ralph Humphrey and Dennis Parker forming the rhythm section) played several gigs at Donte&#x27;s in North Hollywood. But Ellis&#x27;s side project, a workshop orchestra, had been working on different material for two years by this time.

==Don Ellis Orchestra==
In addition to working with the Hindustani Jazz Sextet, Ellis continued writing arrangements for and rehearsing what would grow into the Don Ellis Orchestra. This rehearsal/workshop band played every Monday night for almost a year, first at a venue called Club Havana (club) and later relocating to a club called Bonesville in Hollywood, where they began to gain a significant following. The group started making money by charging a small admission fee to the rehearsals, and began a letter-writing campaign to get the band a spot at the 1966 Monterey Jazz Festival. The campaign eventually succeeded, and the band was scheduled to perform that September.

The Don Ellis Orchestra was different from most other big bands in several ways; most obviously in its instrumentation (discussed below), but also in Ellis&#x27;s incorporation of Indian musical elements into modern big-band writing. Drawing from his compositional and arranging experience, as well as from his studies of Indian music, Ellis began to write jazz-based music with the time signatures he had studied with Rao. These included not only 5/4, 7/8, and 9/4, but also more complex rhythmic cycles like 19/8 and 27/16. In the future, Ellis would use many more complex meters, as well as complex subdivisions of more standard meters. Many of these more complex cycles were inspired by Ellis&#x27;s later interest in Eastern European folk music, such as that of Greece and Bulgaria.

Ellis also had a customized trumpet made for him by the Holton company, which he received in September 1965. Its additional (fourth) valve enabled it to produce quarter tones. Some claim that the inspiration for this may have been due to his studies of Indian music, which includes bent pitches that some ethnomusicologists refer to as &quot;microtones&quot;. However, it was probably more the result of Ellis&#x27;s previous involvement with avant-garde classical music, in which many composers were experimenting with Western tonality and intervals, especially Harry Partch, with whom Ellis is known to have met and discussed ideas.

All of these unusual elements combined to create a musical experience unlike anything the Monterey audience had ever seen. The Orchestra received thunderous applause and a standing ovation at the conclusion of their first tune, titled &quot;33 222 1 222&quot; in accordance with its subdivision of 19. The band went on to play tunes in 7, 9, and 27, as well as a couple in more standard meters. Portions of the concert were released on Pacific Jazz the following year. The 1998 CD reissue includes several other tunes from the concert; the CD&#x27;s notes also reveal that one number, &quot;Concerto for Trumpet&quot;, was actually recorded a month later at a &quot;Pacific Jazz Festival&quot; in Costa Mesa. (The Monterey performance of that tune was apparently not up to the standards of Ellis and the album&#x27;s producer, Richard Bock.)

Following this successful breakthrough performance, the band performed at the Pacific Jazz Festival in October 1966, and at Shelly&#x27;s Manne Hole in March 1967, releasing segments of each on 1967&#x27;s &quot;Live in 3 2/3 4 Time&quot; (Pacific Jazz).

==Columbia Records ==
Around this time, Columbia Records producer and A&amp;R man John Hammond sought to recruit the band for the label. The band was signed, and was in the studio in September 1967 to record &quot;Electric Bath&quot;, which was released the following year to wide acclaim, was nominated for a Grammy award, won the 1968 &quot;Down Beat&quot; &quot;Album of the Year&quot; award, reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts. The song &quot;Indian Lady&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s most popular tunes. &quot;Open Beauty&quot; featured Ellis in an echoplex trumpet solo, an innovative combination of acoustic instruments and electronic technology. Ellis would continue to develop the &quot;electrophonic trumpet&quot; over the next five years (see below).

In February 1968 the Don Ellis Orchestra was back in the studio to record a second album, which would become &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;. However, miscommunications arose, and the album was released with poor edits and inferior alternate takes that Ellis did not approve of. In Ellis&#x27;s own words:
&quot;Upon completion of the album, I did the mixing and editing here in California and then sent the finished product to New York. It wasn&#x27;t until the album was already released that I heard a pressing. Much to my horror, I found that, without consulting me, the whole album had been changed around--rejected masters and unapproved takes were used (not the ones which I had selected and edited), the wrong tunes were on the album, unauthorized splices were made which disturbed the musical flow of some of the compositions (beats were even missing from bars), whole sections were cut out, some of these being the high points of the album. Therefore the liner notes, which were done to the original album, do not agree with what is actually on the album, calling attention to solos and high spots which are not there. [...] Also, the wrong personnel is listed on the jacket.

When I discovered what had happened, I was, naturally, disturbed and asked Columbia to redo the album. They graciously consented and I was able to change the album back to its original form except that I left Mercy Maybe Mercy, which my producer particularly liked, in place of Zim, which I hope will appear in a future album.&quot;
Throughout late 1968, the Orchestra returned to the studio several times to record songs for what would become &quot;Autumn&quot;. The album contained the twenty-minute opus &quot;Variations for Trumpet&quot; that showcased Ellis&#x27;s virtuosic trumpet playing. Also on the record was &quot;Pussy Wiggle Stomp&quot;, the song that would succeed &quot;Indian Lady&quot; as the Orchestra&#x27;s signature tune. Side two of the record contained two lengthy tunes from a concert at Stanford University from August 1968. The tracks are notable for their revelations of the Ellis band&#x27;s contemporary live sound, which was far more raucous than either of their previous live recordings.

In early 1969, the Orchestra was back in Columbia Studios to record &quot;The New Don Ellis Band Goes Underground,&quot; a collection of several pop songs (arranged by Ellis) and some Ellis originals. The album features vocalist Patti Allen on songs by Laura Nyro, The Isley Brothers, and Sly Stone; it also includes &quot;Bulgarian Bulge&quot;, a composition based on a Bulgarian folk tune in 33/16 time.

The band&#x27;s energetic live performances such as the one at Stanford caused its popularity among college crowds to increase. In June 1970, the Orchestra performed for three nights at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore West auditorium, opening for the Quicksilver Messenger Service and Leon Russell. The resulting recording was made into a double LP and released by Columbia in late 1970. &quot;Live at Fillmore&quot; was a happy return to original material, and even included one Beatles cover, a highly experimental rendition of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, as well as another version of &quot;Pussy Wiggle Stomp&quot;.

Around this time, Ellis&#x27;s popularity among educators was also climbing; copies of his band&#x27;s charts were being published and played by many high school and college big bands. Accordingly, Ellis taught many clinics and played with many school bands.

In May 1971, Ellis added a string quartet to the Orchestra. He also hired Bulgarian piano virtuoso Milcho Leviev who was able to improvise fluently in time signatures that would initially be intimidating to most American improvisers. He was an important asset to Ellis&#x27;s band, and stayed with Ellis for five years. The Orchestra was recorded in late May at Basin Street West in San Francisco. The resulting album, &quot;Tears of Joy&quot;, was another live double-LP and was released in late 1971.
The Exotic Rhythms of Don Ellis (May 2002), a dissertation submitted to The Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Musical Arts. The album featured a composition called &quot;Strawberry Soup&quot; that has been the subject of several doctoral dissertations due to its metric intricacy, its simple theme and complex variations, and the sheer timbral spectrum that it covers.

==&quot;The French Connection&quot;==
Around this time, Ellis was approached by film director William Friedkin to compose the music to his film &quot;The French Connection&quot;. Ellis accepted the project and wrote the music to be performed by his own Orchestra. Ellis later won a Grammy for this project (&quot;Best Instrumental Arrangement&quot;), and was asked to write the music to the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;French Connection II&quot; in 1975.

Ellis&#x27;s final album for Columbia, &quot;Connection&quot;, was recorded in August 1972. The album featured &quot;The Theme from &#x27;The French Connection&#x27;&quot;, an abbreviated version of Ellis&#x27;s movie score, and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, a 13/8 tour de force by longtime contributor Hank Levy. Alongside these highlights are arrangements of several pop songs by artists such as Carole King, Yes, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and The Carpenters. The arrangements were generally tongue in cheek; often Ellis arranged them in different meters than the original, or arranged for the melody to be played in a humorous way. There is no singer on this album.

Regardless of what inspired Ellis&#x27;s liberal interpretations of the popular material, &quot;Connection&quot; was the Orchestra&#x27;s last album for Columbia.

==MPS Records==
In 1973, the Orchestra recorded &quot;Soaring&quot;, a collection of originals. Milcho Leviev contributed &quot;Sladka Pitka&quot;, based on a Bulgarian folk song. A Hank Levy tune off the album, &quot;Whiplash&quot;, was later featured in a film of the same name. The record was released by MPS Records, which would also release Ellis&#x27;s next album, &quot;Haiku&quot;. The record, featuring Milcho Leviev, bassist Ray Brown, drummer John Guerin, and a large string orchestra, is made up of ten songs, each based on a Japanese haiku poem. The album is relaxed and introspective. &quot;Haiku&quot; was presumably recorded in late 1973 and released in 1974.

===Mid-1970s: The Organic Band and heart problems===
In 1974, Ellis became interested in the music of Brazil, even studying Portuguese so as to better communicate with indigenous musicians. He led a live band around this time called the Organic Band, which was a stripped-down version of the Orchestra that had no electronic instrumentation or modification (save for amplification). The band also featured a vocal quartet.

These pursuits were postponed when Ellis started having health problems, feeling &quot;out of breath after [walking] up a single flight of stairs&quot;. He checked himself into a hospital in New York City where a doctor diagnosed him with mitral stenosis, a condition which caused his heart to beat in odd rhythms. He was prescribed medication and went home to Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, he started feeling strange again, and went to a local hospital where he was re-diagnosed with an atrial septal defect. More tests were run and finally a third diagnosis was made: cardiomyopathy. Ellis was prescribed more drugs, but his condition worsened and he went into ventricular fibrillation early one morning in May 1975. Ellis later described being on the verge of death, as doctors struggled to save his life: &quot;It sounds weird, I know, but it was a remarkably beautiful experience, maybe the ultimate high.&quot;

=== Late career ===
By 1976, Ellis was back in action, although these activities are little documented. On December 3, 1976, the Don Ellis Orchestra performed on a Shirley MacLaine television special entitled &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; The Orchestra played Ellis&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; retitled &quot;Sweet Shirley MacLaine&quot;. The arrangement featured a solo by Art Pepper, a chorus of tap dancers, and the return of the electrophonic trumpet.

In 1977, Ellis was signed to Atlantic Records, which promised to fund the Orchestra&#x27;s upcoming trip for the band&#x27;s performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland in exchange for a live recording of said performance. However, the record company asked Don first to record arrangements of two songs from &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The songs, &quot;Star Wars (Main Title)&quot; and &quot;Princess Leia&#x27;s Theme&quot;, were to be released as a 45 rpm single. In June, the record company scrambled and asked Don to record an entire album of material, for the purpose of having an album to sell in case the single became a hit. Don had to do this before his band left to perform in Montreux in about a week. In addition, the songs that were to be on this album could not be duplicates of what would later appear on the live album.

Ellis got some help from fellow composers/arrangers Tommy Vig and Curt Berg but largely wrote everything on his own. The album was thrown together and released as &quot;Music from Other Galaxies and Planets&quot;; all the songs were retitled with novelty space-related names such as &quot;Orion&#x27;s Sword&quot; and &quot;Crypton&quot;.

The band&#x27;s performance at Montreux was well received, and the subsequent album reached No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts. This was to be Ellis&#x27;s last album as a leader, although he would appear on albums by Nick Gilder (&quot;You Know Who You Are&quot;) and Tommy Vig (&quot;1978&quot;).

Ellis&#x27;s last known public performance took place on April 21, 1978, at the Westside Room in Century City. After this, his doctor ordered him to refrain from touring and playing trumpet because it was too stressful on his heart. On December 17, 1978, after seeing a Jon Hendricks concert, Ellis suffered a fatal heart attack at his North Hollywood home where his parents were staying with him. His heart condition is believed to have been cardiac arrhythmia. He was 44. Ellis was buried in the Sheltering Hills section of Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Hollywood Hills, California.

==Legacy ==
Ellis had a strong influence on those with whom he worked. Former sideman Stu Blumberg credited Ellis for preparing him for the idiosyncrasies of unconventional music in film soundtracks. Tenor saxophonist Jim Snodgrass remarked, &quot;I think in many ways Don was a teacher. One thing his music taught me was that I could play anything I absolutely had to.&quot; Sidemen like Tom Scott, John Klemmer, Glenn Ferris, Milcho Leviev and a few others have gone on to prolific solo careers. Others like Ralph Humphrey and Fred Selden have had successful careers as sidemen, session musicians or educators. Ellis was an ardent libertarian. This arose from his open-mindedness towards the music of other cultures, according to some of his students.

Most of Ellis&#x27;s albums have been reissued on CD. Columbia Records, responsible for originally releasing seven of Ellis&#x27;s albums, only reissued &quot;Electric Bath&quot; (Ellis&#x27;s biggest seller) in 1997; the rest have been leased to other companies for reissue. Today, thanks to labels like Koch Jazz, Wounded Bird and Mighty Quinn Productions, almost all of his albums have been reissued on CD and are readily available. The Sleepy Night record company in the UK has recently released a number of CDs of live performances from Don Ellis&#x27; private collection.

Ellis also wrote numerous articles and several books. &quot;The New Rhythm Book&quot; (1972) presents methods of practice and performance in unusual meters and features a companion play-along LP/cassette entitled &quot;New Rhythms&quot;. His second book, &quot;Quarter Tones&quot;, published in 1975, is a theoretical guide to using quarter tones. Both books are thorough, providing a great deal of historical and cultural background to their subjects. &quot;Quarter Tones&quot; also provides readers with etudes and exercises. Both books are hard to find, as they have presumably not been printed since their first editions.

The Don Ellis Library and Collection resides in the Ethnomusicology Archives at UCLA. Prior to that, (from 1981 to 2000) it was housed at Eastfield College, part of Dallas County Community College District, DCCCD in Mesquite, Texas. Along with writings, instruments and other items, is his Grammy for best score for the movie &quot;The French Connection&quot; in 1971.

== Orchestra instrumentation ==
Ellis&#x27;s interest in expanding the possibilities within big band instrumentation is obvious on even his first Orchestra release, 1966&#x27;s &quot;Live at Monterey&quot;. Inspired by his experiences with Latin bands, Ellis expanded his rhythm section to two drum sets, three double-basses, at least two auxiliary percussionists, piano, and organ. On the song &quot;Turkish Bath&quot; from &quot;Electric Bath&quot; (1967), bassist Ray Neapolitan doubles on sitar. His horn sections were often fairly typical, although he later added a tuba and French horn to augment the brass section, and sometimes had the saxophonists double on instruments like flute, oboe, clarinet and saxello.

In 1967, Ellis began experimentation with electronics. His pianist started using the Fender-Rhodes electric piano, clavinet, and electric harpsichord. Ellis himself started using what he called the &quot;electrophonic trumpet&quot;; that is, a trumpet whose sound was amplified and often routed through various effects processors. The first appearance of this innovation is on &quot;Open Beauty&quot; from 1967&#x27;s &quot;Electric Bath&quot;, in which Ellis takes an extended solo with his trumpet being processed through an echoplex. Ellis also used the ring modulator on several occasions, which was built for him by Tom Oberheim.

In 1968, Ellis replaced his double bassists with a single electric bassist, at first Joe Julian, then Dennis Parker, and finally Dave McDaniel. He also hired guitarist Jay Graydon who remained with the band for several years.

In 1971, for the &quot;Tears of Joy&quot; tour, Ellis added a string quartet to his band. The instruments were amplified using newly developed pick-ups made by Barcus-Berry so that they could be heard over the brass and saxophones. These new timbres offered Ellis a wellspring of creative possibilities. As he explained, &quot;People spend whole evenings listening to a brass quintet, a woodwind or string quartet, so I reasoned that having ALL of these in the context of a big band should give us a fantastic variety of colors from which to draw.&quot;

The 1974 album &quot;Haiku&quot; was recorded using a jazz quartet with full string orchestra backing. Due to the size of the group, this was probably never intended to be a replacement for the Don Ellis Orchestra as a touring group.

Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Organic Band&quot;, which toured throughout spring and summer 1974, reduced the band&#x27;s numbers from 21 or 22 to 15. The horn section was more than halved, the string quartet was removed, a vocal quartet was added, and no electronics (save for amplification) were used to alter the band&#x27;s sound.

After his heart attack, Ellis returned briefly to the electrophonic trumpet, and continued using synthesizers and electronic keyboards. The string quartet, a mainstay since 1971, remained alongside the brass. He also began playing two new instruments, the superbone and the firebird, which were a combination valve-slide trombone and trumpet, respectively. Both were also played by Maynard Ferguson.

<doc id="975110" wikidata="Q1187566" url="?curid=975110" title="Snob effect">
<text>The snob effect is a phenomenon described in microeconomics as a situation where the demand for a certain good by individuals of a higher income level is inversely related to its demand by those of a lower income level. The &quot;snob effect&quot; contrasts most other microeconomic models, in that the demand curve can have a positive slope, rather than the typical negatively sloped demand curve of normal goods.

This situation is derived by the desire to own unusual, expensive or unique goods. These goods usually have a high economic value, but low practical value. The less of an item available, the higher its snob value. Examples of such items with general snob value are rare works of art, designer clothing, and sports cars.

In all these cases, one can debate whether they meet the snob value criterion, which in itself may vary from person to person. A person may reasonably claim to purchase a designer garment because of a certain threading technique, longevity, and fabric. While this is true in some cases, the desired effect can often be achieved by purchasing a less-expensive version from a reputable brand. Often these high-end items end up as closeout items in discount stores or online retailers where they may be offered at deep discounts from original price, bringing into question the true value of the product. Ultimately, wealthy consumers can be lured by superficial factors such as rarity, celebrity representation and brand prestige.

Collectors within a specific field can suffer from snob effect, searching for the rarest and often most expensive collectibles. Such examples are classic automobiles, stamps and coins.

<doc id="975111" wikidata="Q16930052" url="?curid=975111" title="Mark Twain effect">
<text>In some stock markets, the October Effect also referred to as the Mark Twain effect is the phenomenon of stock returns in October being lower than in other months. The reference to Mark Twain comes from a line in Mark Twain&#x27;s Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson: &quot;October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.&quot;

The quotation is a sarcastic assertion that speculation in stocks is always dangerous. Twain wrote Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson in 1894 many years before the stock market crashes of 1929, 1987 and 2008 which roughly occurred in October.

<doc id="975114" wikidata="Q2924223" url="?curid=975114" title="Break Like the Wind">
<text>Break Like the Wind is a 1992 album by the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap. The songs include a range of genres, from the glam metal anthem &quot;Bitch School&quot; down to the skiffle satire of &quot;All the Way Home&quot;. The title, and the album&#x27;s title track, is a double entendre that combines and confuses the idiom &quot;make like the wind&quot; (also possibly a reference to the Christopher Cross song &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;, famously covered by British heavy metal band Saxon) with &quot;&quot;, a euphemism for flatulence.

Originally, the CD was packaged in an 18-inch &quot;extra-long box&quot;, as a satire against the controversial packaging policy of longboxes which was increasingly criticized as unnecessary and wasteful. The album notes are by Steely Dan&#x27;s Walter Becker, who spends the entire page highlighting the Crosley Phase Linear Ionic Induction Voice Processor System and ignoring the band and music entirely.

The album reached #44 in Canada.

==Backstory==
In the film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, David St. Hubbins (portrayed by Michael McKean) and Nigel Tufnel (portrayed by Christopher Guest) claim &quot;All the Way Home&quot; is the first song they wrote together, and that six years after it was written, David and Nigel recorded the song in December 1961. The film recounts the two being in different bands, David in the &#x27;Creatures&#x27; and Nigel with the &#x27;Lovely Lads&#x27;. Similarly, &quot;The Sun Never Sweats&quot; is implied to be the title track from their fictitious album of the same name, whose cover is shown on the packaging of the album &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;. &quot;Clam Caravan&quot; is apparently a &quot;misspelling&quot; of &quot;Calm Caravan&quot;.

<text>Ernie Ball (born Roland Sherwood Ball; August 30, 1930 – September 9, 2004) was an American entrepreneur and musician who developed guitar-related products. Ball began as a club and local television musician and entrepreneur, building an international business in guitars and accessories. Ernie Ball Inc. is the eponymous corporation Ball started to market guitar accessories.

==Early life==
Ball was born Roland Sherwood Ball in Santa Monica, California, and grew up in a musical family, the son of Frances (née Shankland) and Roland Adelbert Ball. His paternal grandfather, Ernest Ball, wrote the standard &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; and his father was a car salesman who taught Hawaiian steel guitar on the side. Although Ball began to play steel guitar at age nine to please his father, he lost interest for several years. In his early teens he took a renewed interest in the instrument, practicing as many as three hours a day. Within a year he was a member of the Musicians Union.

==Career==
===Professional musician===
While still in his early teens, Ball began playing professionally in South Central Los Angeles beer bars. By age 19 he joined the Tommy Duncan Band playing pedal steel guitar. Duncan, the former lead singer with Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, took the band on tour through the Southwestern United States. During the Korean War, he did a tour of duty in the United States Air Force Band, playing guitar and bass drum. After the military, he returned to Los Angeles and continued playing in barrooms and lounges, until landing a job on the 1950s &quot;Western Varieties&quot; program at KTLA television. The position soon gained him wider recognition in the Los Angeles music scene and led to studio work and teaching jobs.

===Entrepreneurship===

Sometime in 1957 or 1958, Ball opened a music store in Tarzana, California. He claimed it was the first shop in the United States to sell guitars exclusively. When music sales representatives criticized him for refusing to sell drumsticks and other musical equipment, Ball replied, &quot;I just want to sell guitars.&quot; Within the next two years he opened additional stores in Canoga Park and Thousand Oaks. 

In the 1960s, Ball began manufacturing custom guitar strings. By the early 1970s, Ball established brand distributors in Europe and Asia. Eventually, the products spawned from his company would sell in more than 5,500 stores and be exported to more than 70 countries of the world. Ball, along with former Fender employee George Fullerton, was instrumental in the development of the first modern acoustic bass guitar, introduced under the Earthwood brand in 1972. Although unsuccessful, surviving models are highly collectable. In the early eighties, Ball bought the Music Man Company, further expanding into the production of guitars, basses, and amplifiers.

In 1985, the company was moved to a new facility in San Luis Obispo and remained there with all of its operations until early 2003, when the company relocated its string manufacturing to Coachella in Southern California’s Riverside County. Under Ball&#x27;s leadership, it grossed more than $40 million per annum.

==Personal life and death==
Ball had diverse interests including collecting cars, surfing and flying airplanes. He also authored a series of books and manuals on guitar playing. He was married to Nova Gail (Conley), and had four children: Sherwood Ball, the ex-husband of actress Susan Anspach, David Ball, Sterling Ball, and Nova Ball. His granddaughter is actress Hannah Marks.

Ball remained active in his company until his death 42 years after its founding. He died from an ongoing, undisclosed illness on September 9, 2004, leaving the business to his sons and other family members. He was buried near his home at San Luis Cemetery in San Luis Obispo, California.

<text>Jessica Pietersen (; born 23 June 1980) is an English singer. She is best known as member of the pop group Liberty X.

==Career==
===1999–2007: Liberty X and hiatus===
In a 1999 Pietersen starred the musical &quot;Gigi&quot; as the title role. In 2001, Pietersen auditioned for the ITV reality television music competition &quot;Popstars&quot;, a show intended to form a new group from individual contestants, becoming one of the finalist. While the five winning contestants formed Hear&#x27;Say, the five runner-up contestants – Young, Tony Lundon, Kevin Simm, Kelli Young and Michelle Heaton – formed the group Liberty X and signed a multimillion-pound record contract with Richard Branson and V2 Records. Liberty X released three studio albums and enjoyed seven Top 10 singles from 2001 to 2005: Their biggest hit, &quot;Just a Little&quot;, reached number one in May 2002; &quot;Thinking It Over&quot;, &quot;Got to Have Your Love&quot;, &quot;Song 4 Lovers&quot;, and &quot;Holding on for You&quot; all reached the top 5 in the UK Singles Chart. They split up in 2007 after selling over 3 million records worldwide.

During this time, Pietersen also appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Ice Dancing&quot; in 2005, finishing in second place, and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in 2009, finishing in third place. After the split, Pietersen took a long hiatus from her artistic career.

===2013–present: Liberty X return===
In 2013 Pietersen reunited with Liberty X for ITV2&#x27;s reality show &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, along with other pop groups of their time – B*Witched, Honeyz, 911, Five and Atomic Kitten – to solve past problems and do a live performance at the London Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February. Due to the success, Liberty X returned for a full tour between 2013 and 2014. She also appeared in the game shows &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; and &quot;The Chase&quot;, facing Mark Labbett and winning £75,000 in her individual chase. In 2017, Pietersen, Kelli Young and Michelle Heaton reformed Liberty X again, but as a three-piece girl group, without Tony and Kevin. Since then, they continued touring at music festivals and Pride events.

==Personal life==
On 29 December 2007, she married England cricketer Kevin Pietersen at a service in Castle Combe. They have two children: Dylan Blake, born on 10 May 2010, and Rosie, born on 27 December 2015.

<doc id="975124" wikidata="Q357718" url="?curid=975124" title="Brock Adams">
<text>Brockman Adams (January 13, 1927 – September 10, 2004) was an American lawyer and politician. A Democrat from Washington, Adams served as a U.S. Representative, Senator, and United States Secretary of Transportation. He was forced to retire in January 1993 due to public and widespread sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape allegations.

==Early life and education==
Adams was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and attended public schools in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, graduating in 1944 from Broadway High School in Seattle. He attended the University of Washington where, in 1948, he was elected president of the student government (ASUW) and was the first student to both serve in that post and receive the President&#x27;s Medal of Excellence as the university&#x27;s top scholar. In 1949, Mary Maxwell served as secretary to ASUW president Adams. Later that year, Adams introduced Maxwell to his friend and her future husband, William Henry Gates II. He graduated in 1949 and was admitted to Harvard Law School, where he earned his law degree in 1952.

Adams was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa society.

===Naval and legal career===
Adams served in the U.S. Navy from 1944 to 1946, and was admitted to the Washington state bar in 1952, opening a private practice in Seattle. He was a member of the American Bar Association.

Adams taught law at the American Institute of Banking from 1954 to 1960, and served as United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington from 1961 to 1964.

==Political career==

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Adams was elected as a Democrat to the House and served six terms beginning January 3, 1965. He was chairman of the newly created Budget Committee during the 94th Congress, and was considered a strong candidate for Speaker of the House.

=== Secretary of Transportation ===
On January 22, 1977, Adams resigned to become the fifth Secretary of Transportation following his appointment by President Jimmy Carter and confirmation by the Senate.

Adams&#x27;s willingness to plunge into controversial issues during his time as Transportation Secretary was evident in the contrasting assessments of his tenure and accomplishments during a tumultuous period in transportation. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1979 called him the &quot;biggest disappointment&quot; in the Carter cabinet, while Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook, who led the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under Adams, called him &quot;absolutely one of the best transportation secretaries we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;.

After resigning his Cabinet post on July 20, 1979, Adams resumed law practice, this time in Washington, D.C., where he was a lobbyist for CSX Corporation and other railroad carriers.
===U.S. Senator===
On November 4, 1986, Adams was elected to the U.S. Senate, narrowly defeating incumbent Republican Slade Gorton with 50.66% of the vote. Serving one term, he compiled a liberal record and was strongly supportive of his party&#x27;s leadership.

=== Sexual assault, rape allegations ===
Kari Tupper, the daughter of a longtime friend, accused Adams of drugging and assaulting her in 1987.

In 1992 eight women made statements to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; alleging that Adams had committed various acts of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, molestation and rape. Multiple women said they were drugged after being served suspicious drinks and either assaulted or raped.

In the exposé, an unnamed source said, &quot;Adams had long been known by his staff and associates for aggressively kissing and handling women within his reach.&quot;

A former Democratic Party activist alleged that in the early 1970s, when Adams was serving in the House of Representatives, he invited her to a Seattle bar, where he drugged her with what he called &quot;Vitamin C&quot;, after she recalled suffering from a cold. The woman said Adams followed her home, pushed her onto a couch and raped her.

A young woman in her thirties told &quot;The Washingtonian&quot; that while she was seated to Adams&#x27;s right at a formal luncheon shortly after she had taken a new job on Capitol Hill, he slid his hand under her skirt to the upper part of her thigh, whereupon she tried to move her leg away from him. Failing that, she said she tried to remove his hand, but Adams dug his fingers into her skin.

=== Forced retirement ===
Adams denied the allegations in a press conference. But already under the spotlight due to previously aired allegations that he drugged and molested a young female aide in 1987, a highly publicized matter in which no charges were brought, Adams was forced to drop out of his reelection campaign.

== Death ==
In retirement, Adams lived in Stevensville, Maryland. He died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Legacy ==
In light of the 2017 #MeToo Movement, some see Adams&#x27;s legacy as a powerful politician who systematically abused his power over young women as emblematic of the culture of harassment in the government.

In 2020, an extensive PBS exposé concerning the workplace for women in the 1990s in Washington, D.C., described the climate of &quot;sexual harassment and sexual entitlement [that] existed in some offices in the Senate&quot;, driven by some male senators whose behavior was well known on Capitol Hill. There was a list of senators and congressmen whom young women were told to keep away from, which included Adams, John Conyers, Ted Kennedy, Bob Packwood, Mel Reynolds, Gus Savage, and Strom Thurmond .

<doc id="975126" wikidata="Q25302518" url="?curid=975126" title="Jama'at Khana">
<text>Jamatkhana or Jamat Khana (from , literally &quot;congregational place&quot;) is an amalgamation derived from the Arabic word &quot;jama‘a&quot; (gathering) and the Persian word &quot;khana&quot; (house, place). It is a term used by some Muslim communities around the world, particularly Sufi ones, to a place of gathering. Among some communities of Muslims, the term is often used interchangeably with the Arabic word musallah (a place of worship that has not been formally sanctified as a &quot;masjid&quot; or is a place that is being temporarily used as a place of worship by a Muslim). The Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī community uses the term &quot;Jama&#x27;at Khana&quot; to denote their places of worship.

==The Jamatkhana as a place of gathering and prayer==
While the &quot;masjid&quot; (literally: the place of a Muslim&#x27;s &quot;sujood&quot; or prostration before God) or &quot;mosque&quot; (in English) is the term used by the Qur&#x27;an to denote the primary space of &quot;salaat&quot; (communal Muslim prayers), a range of spaces for Islamic communal purposes can be currently found throughout the Muslim world. Some are concentrated within particular geographic regions while others are in use by specific communities. Some of these include: &quot;husayniyyas&quot; (also known as &quot;ashurkhanas&quot;, &quot;imambaras&quot;, &quot;matams&quot;, or &quot;takyehs&quot; in Iran) used by Ithna ‘Ashari Shi‘i communities; &quot;khanqahs&quot;, &quot;ribats&quot;, &quot;takyas&quot; and &quot;zawiyas&quot; used by mystically-oriented Muslim communities commonly referred to as Sufis; the &quot;cemevi&quot; of the Turkish Alevis; the &quot;cemxane&quot; of the Kurdish Alevis; and the &quot;majlis&quot; and of the Druze. For Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlīs, the primary space of religious and social gathering is the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot;. The term &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; is also used to refer to spaces used by a number of other Muslim communities with bases in South Asia, such as the Chisti Sufi &quot;tariqa,&quot; and various branches of the Musta’li Ismaili community including the Dawoodi Bohras and Alavi Bohras.

The Chisti Sufi &quot;tariqa&quot; utilizes their &quot;Jamatkhanas&quot; as a meeting space for conversation and counsel with the &quot;pir&quot; or teacher. The Shi‘i Bohra Ismaili communities use the term to designate their space for social gatherings and communal meals. It is customary amongst many Musta’li Ismaili communities in South Asia and their diasporas to have a &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; in the same complexes as their &quot;masjids&quot;. While the latter is the primary site for formal religious activities of the different branches of Bohra Ismailis – including the Da’udi, Sulaymani, and Alevi – the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; acts as a site for less formalized religious gatherings, weddings, feasts and other events aligned with special days. Among Sunni Muslims known as &quot;Memons&quot;, the term &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; is used to denote a space for cultural gatherings and special occasions. Spaces designated as &quot;Jamatkhanas&quot; can also be seen in Mughal complexes, such as that of the Taj Mahal in Agra.

==The Jamatkhana in Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlīsm==

The exact origins of the use of &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; in the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī tradition are not as yet clear. However, communal memory, oral traditions and individual Ginans (Indo-Muslim religious poems) narrate that Pirs Shams (fl. between 13th and 15th centuries) and Sadr al-Din (fl. 14th century), emissaries appointed by the Ismaili Imam in Persia and sent to the South Asia in the service of the faith, established the first such spaces for the nascent Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī communities in Sindh, Punjab, Kashmir and China during their lifetimes. &quot;Jannatpuri&quot;, a long composition known as a &quot;granth&quot; and belonging to the genre of the Ginans, by Sayyid Imamshah (d. after 1473) situates one of the earliest of these &quot;Jamatkhanas&quot; to a place by the name of Kotda, which is thought to be in modern-day Sindh in Pakistan. The same composition also mentions that the village headman, the &quot;mukhi&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;mukhya&quot;) was closely associated with the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; as an official.

=== Earliest Jamatkhanas ===
The Jamatkhana was a space particular to several localized Ismaili communities of the South Asia, primarily in delta regions. It was subsequently adopted by a wider range of Indian Ismaili communities in subsequent decades and centuries. These diverse groups, each with their own histories, identities and social organization identified themselves using various names such as Momin (or Mumna), Shamsi, Khoja and Gupti. Collectively, these communities adopted the practice of Satpanth (lit. true path), a designation for Shi‘i Ismailism of this period in the Subcontinent which included communal congregation in the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot;.

The term seems to have come in use to designate the place of Satpanthi religious gathering fairly late, possibly not until the last decades of the 18th or early years of the 19th centuries. The most common term used in the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī &quot;ginans&quot; to refer to these spaces is the term &quot;gat.&quot;
=== Evolution of the Jamatkhana ===
By the mid-19th century, as Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī communities migrated from towns and villages to urban centres throughout the Indian Ocean littoral, the &quot;khana&quot; seems to have become a distinct space housed in a separate structure, usually located within a &quot;mohalla&quot;, or enclave, of Satpanthi believers. Several of the oldest extant examples of &quot;Jamatkhanas&quot; go back to this period. Most, however, have subsequently been renovated and added to, to accommodate the changing functional needs and ritual practices of the &quot;jamats&quot; (congregation) that they serve. The oldest of these urban structures can be found in places such as Gwadar (present day Pakistan), Zanzibar and Bombay (present day India). More modest examples that date from this period can also be found throughout Kutch and in Jerruk in interior Sindh, the residence of Aga Khan I upon his arrival to the South Asia. The architecture and organization of these spaces tell us that there was no single architectural template or model of the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot;, but rather each was constructed based on a series of circumstances including such things as location, cultural environment, architectural practices of the period and resources available. The variations from one &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; to the next also gives us clues to the nature of practices, the use and allocation of space and the nature and function of social relationships. Some of these were due to the cultural milieu in which the &quot;Jamatkhanas&quot; were situated while others followed general traditions of pietic and religious culture, which in turn informed rules of decorum and etiquette within these spaces.

In 1870, the Bombay Jamatkhana in Khadak became the first &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; assigned as a &quot;darkhana.&quot; The term, was initially used to designate the chief residence of the Imam. In later years, however, it came to stand for the principal &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; in a national context. Today, eight countries have &quot;Darkhana Jamatkhanas&quot; in the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī tradition. These include India, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Canada, Pakistan, England and Portugal.

=== Jamatkhana as the Centre of Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī Practice ===

While the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; initially began as a space of congregation specific to Satpanthi communities, it eventually was adopted by Ismaili communities with different geographic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds and historical experiences who before this congregated in spaces with different trajectories and nomenclatures. During the seven decades of Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III’s (d. 1957) Imamat, formal relationships with Ismaili communities living in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, China, the Northern Areas of Pakistan, Persia and Syria, were strengthened.

Ismailis of the Northern Areas of Pakistan, namely Chitral, Ghizr, Gilgit, Hunza, as well as the border regions of China, were some of the first communities to adopt the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot; into their ritual life. But these Jamat Khana&#x27;s were not open spaces like the other Jamat Khana&#x27;s, due to political restrictions, the followers use to meet at a designated house and perform all the rituals. They use to practice their faith in hiding, and in Punjab, were known as the &quot;shamsi&quot;, or secretive (&quot;gupti&quot;) community.

The seeds of these institutions were planted in 1923 when a missionary by the name of Ramzanali Sabzali (d. 1938) was sent to these various communities by Aga Khan III. Jamatkhanas were also introduced in Syria in the period of the 1940s. It was not however, until the tenure and leadership of the present Imam of the Ismailis, His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan (b. 1936) that similar spaces were also introduced in Iran (1960s), Afghanistan (1960s and 2001) and Tajikistan (2009). In parts of Iran, spaces referred to as &quot;khane-ye kolon&quot; and &quot;khanqah&quot; preceded the &quot;Jamatkhana&quot;.

=== Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī Centres ===
In 1979, the foundation stone was laid for what was to become the first ‘Ismaili Centre’ in London&#x27;s South Kensington neighbourhood. The high-profile building which was opened by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925–2013; r. 1979–1990) in the presence of His Highness the Aga Khan in April 1985 was an important chapter in a new era of Ismaili presence in Europe. Several months later in August, another Ismaili Centre was opened in Vancouver&#x27;s Burnaby district (Canada) by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (1939–2024; r. 1984–1993). Each architecturally unique, these purpose built centres constructed by internationally reputed architects occupy prominent places in their respective cities and include, in addition to the central prayer hall, spaces to facilitate intellectual and social gatherings, meeting rooms, educational facilities, libraries, gardens and water features. The buildings were not only meant to act as symbolic markers of the Ismaili community&#x27;s presence in England and Canada, but also as an ambassadorial bridge which would continue to help them develop and maintain relationships with other faith groups and civil society organizations.

In 1998, the third such ‘Ismaili Centre’ was opened in Lisbon, Portugal. The Centre draws inspiration from regional influences of the Moorish architectural heritage such as the Alhambra in Granada as well as that of other Muslim cultural forms such as that of Fatehpur Sikri in India. In particular, the interplay and combination of outdoor and indoor spaces gave the building a different aesthetic and feel from the other Ismaili Centres that had been designed two decades earlier, further demonstrating how time and space influence contemporary Ismaili religious architecture.

The first Ismaili Centre in the Middle East was opened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on March 26, 2008, by the Aga Khan in the presence of senior members of the ruling family of Dubai. The centre, built on land donated by the Shaykh Mohammed b. Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai&#x27;s ruler in 1982, is the first such Centre in the Middle East. The building draws its inspiration from Cairo&#x27;s Fatimid architecture heritage, a dynasty founded by the Aga Khan&#x27;s forefathers and previous Imams of the Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī community in the tenth century.

An Ismaili Centre in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, firmly located in the Persian-speaking Muslim world, reflects and marks the centuries of Ismaili presence in Central Asia and surrounding regions. Opened on October 12, 2009, by Republic&#x27;s President, Emamoli Rahmon and the Aga Khan, its architecture blends a diverse range of artisanal and craft traditions of the region and draws upon as inspiration of the grand courtyards of Samarkand and Khiva in Uzbekistan as well as the tenth century Samanid mausoleum. Technical innovations include earthquake resistant roofing which transfers structural stress, a heating and air conditioning system based on water source heat pumps and a heat recovery wheel for energy efficiency.

The second Ismaili Centre to be built in Canada, the Ismaili Centre, Toronto, was opened in 2014 in Toronto&#x27;s Don Mills area and follows the pattern of earlier buildings, representing functionally and symbolically the presence of Ismaili communities in Europe and North America. The Ismaili Centre in Toronto is the largest such centre in the English-speaking world. The Toronto Ismaili Centre shares its grounds with the Aga Khan Museum, both of which sit in the Aga Khan Park.

Further Ismaili Centres, in various stages of development will follow shortly: centres in Houston, Texas and Los Angeles, California are being planned.

<text>EMI Records (formerly EMI Records Ltd.) is a British multinational record label owned by Universal Music Group. It was originally founded as a British flagship label by the music company EMI in 1972, and launched in January 1973 as the successor to its Columbia and Parlophone record labels. The label was later launched worldwide. It has a branch in India called EMI Records India, run by director Mohit Suri. In 2014, Universal Music Japan revived the label in Japan as the successor to EMI Records Japan. In June 2020, Universal revived the label as the successor to Virgin EMI, with Virgin Records now operating as an imprint of EMI Records. In February 2024, UMG Philippines relaunched EMI as a successor to the former EMI Philippines label after 22 years.

==History==

An EMI Records Ltd. legal entity was created in 1956 as the record manufacturing and distribution arm of EMI in the UK. It oversaw EMI&#x27;s various labels, including The Gramophone Co. Ltd., Columbia Graphophone Company, and Parlophone Co. Ltd.

The global success that EMI enjoyed in the 1960s exposed the fact that the company had the rights to only some of its trademarks in some parts of the world, most notably His Master&#x27;s Voice and Columbia, with RCA Victor and the American Columbia Records, respectively, owning the rights to these trademarks in the Western Hemisphere.

Complicating matters was Columbia&#x27;s formation of its own operations in the UK by purchasing Oriole Records and changing its name to that of its then-parent company CBS (the legal trademark designation bearing the full name of the parent company, &quot;Trade Mark of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.&quot;), and as CBS Records International becoming highly successful, a serious rival to EMI, in the UK.

In July 1965, the standalone EMI Record labels were extracted from E.M.I. Records Ltd. and folded into The Gramophone Company Ltd. On 1 July 1973, The Gramophone Co. Ltd. was renamed EMI Records Ltd. At the same time, E.M.I. Records Ltd. was wound down and its activities were absorbed into EMI Records Ltd.

Earlier, on 1 January 1973, all of The Gramophone Company Ltd. pop labels (Columbia, Parlophone, Harvest, Sovereign and Regal) had been rebranded as EMI. EMI Records then signed new music artists that became worldwide successes: Kraftwerk, Renaissance, Queen, Olivia Newton-John, Iron Maiden, Kate Bush, Sheena Easton, and Pink Floyd (though some of these acts were on different labels in the US, not EMI&#x27;s Capitol Records). In 1978, EMI launched EMI America Records as its second label in the United States after Capitol, and in 1988, EMI America later merged with sister label Manhattan Records, founded in 1984, becoming EMI Manhattan Records and eventually EMI Records USA when Capitol absorbed it in 1989. In June 1997, the EMI Records USA division was folded into Virgin Records and Capitol.

In October 1979, EMI Ltd. merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to become Thorn EMI, whose shareholders voted on 16 August 1996 in favour of demerging Thorn from EMI again. The recorded music division became EMI Group plc, and the electronics and rentals divisions were divested as Thorn plc.

In 2010, EMI Records opened a country music division, EMI Records Nashville, which includes on its roster Troy Olsen, Alan Jackson, Kelleigh Bannen, and Eric Church. EMI Records Nashville is a sister label to the Capitol Nashville unit of Universal Music Group.

Australia&#x27;s most prolific artist, Slim Dusty, signed with the Columbia Graphophone Co. for Regal Zonophone Records in 1946 and remained with EMI until his death in 2003, selling over seven million records for the label in Australia by 2007.

Virgin EMI Records retained use of the EMI branding after Universal Music Group&#x27;s acquisition of EMI in September 2012, but it is otherwise unrelated to the old label which was defunct and renamed Parlophone Records in 2013 and is now part of Warner Music Group. EMI Christian Music Group was renamed Capitol Christian Music Group. EMI Classics was sold to Warner Music Group in February 2013. After EU regulatory approval, EMI Classics was absorbed into Warner Classics in July 2013. The reissues of pre-1997 releases from EMI America and EMI Records USA are handled by UMG&#x27;s Capitol Music Group, Virgin Records&#x27; American distributor and a stand-alone British distributor. The distributors of the vast majority of EMI Records&#x27; UK catalogue are Rhino Entertainment in the US and WEA International for the world outside the US.

In April 2013, EMI Music Japan became defunct following Universal&#x27;s acquisition of EMI. The company&#x27;s successor was EMI Records Japan, a sublabel of Universal Music Japan. In February 2014, Universal Japan did a label reorganization, with more than half of the former EMI Records Japan artists being transferred to Nayutawave Records. Later that year, the two sublabels were combined and rebranded as EMI Records. Since 2018, Takeshi Okada has been the managing director of Universal Japan&#x27;s EMI Records label. In 2020, the label launched an official YouTube channel, six years after the label was formed.

On 16 June 2020, Universal rebranded Virgin EMI Records as EMI Records and named Rebecca Allen (former president of UMG&#x27;s Decca label) as the label&#x27;s president.

In September 2020, Universal launched Motown UK, under EMI Records.

In January 2023, EMI launched EMI North, based in Leeds, becoming the &quot;first major to open a physical space outside of London&quot;. In July 2023, Universal Japan announced a new imprint label, Holo-n, which will operate under their EMI Records division in partnership with Hololive Production.

In February 2024, UMG Philippines relaunched EMI Records as a successor to the former EMI Philippines label, now known as PolyEast Records.

===EMI United Kingdom===
EMI United Kingdom is a brand of EMI Records that, despite the name, appeared worldwide between roughly 1993 and 1998, used mainly for artists such as Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd, as a sister imprint to Parlophone, EMI Premiere, hEMIsphere, Eminence, EMI Gold and the home video division Picture Music International. During the 1990s, it reissued albums that originally bore the Harvest Records, Columbia Graphophone Company, RAK Records, Regal Zonophone, His Master&#x27;s Voice, Music for Pleasure and Starline labels.

As of 2013, EMI UK&#x27;s catalogue is owned by Warner Music Group after the acquisition of the Parlophone Label Group&#x27;s assets. By contrast, UMG owns the catalogue of reissues from Deep Purple&#x27;s albums between 1972 and 1975 on the band&#x27;s vanity label Purple, in addition to their last albums for EMI in Europe, &quot;Abandon&quot; and &quot;Bananas&quot;.

<doc id="975136" wikidata="Q1780995" url="?curid=975136" title="20th Century Fox Records">
<text>20th Century Fox Records (also known as 20th Fox Records and 20th Century Records, or simply 20th Century Fox Film Scores and Fox Records) was a wholly owned subsidiary of film studio 20th Century Fox. The history of the label covers three distinct 20th Century Fox-related operations in the analog era, ranging chronologically from about 1938 to 1981.

==History==

20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) was formed through the merger of Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s Twentieth Century Pictures with the Fox Film Corporation on May 31, 1935. Before the merger, Fox Film Corporation tried out a couple of short-lived record labels in conjunction with its Movietone sound system. Although Movietone was a dedicated sound-on-film system, in 1929-30 Fox produced some soundtracks on disc to accompany features shown in theaters not yet equipped for optical sound. Between 1933 and 1937, a custom record label called &quot;Fox Movietone&quot; was produced starting at F-100 and running through F-136. It featured songs from Fox movies, first using material recorded and issued on the RCA Victor Bluebird label and halfway through switched to material recorded and issued on ARC&#x27;s dime store labels. These scarce records were sold only at Fox Theaters.

In 1938, 20th Century began a new, semi-private line of records employing white labels with typed, or mimeographed, information. Matrix numbers are variable, but the earliest known records in this series correspond to the picture &quot;Sally, Irene and Mary&quot; (1938) and the latest ones to &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1943). These discs were limited exclusively to studio properties recorded on 20th Century Fox soundstages and were used for promotional purposes and as giveaways to staff and visitors to the studio itself. After this small scale venture was discontinued, 20th Century Fox stayed out of record production for about 15 years, though its music division remained very active in licensing 20th Century Fox musicals and soundtrack music for use on record albums to other companies, such as that for the 1956 film &quot;The King and I&quot;, released on Capitol Records. The studio also had success in the 1950s with films starring popular singers Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, with Presley making his film debut in &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; (1956) and Boone debuting in &quot;Bernardine&quot; and then following it up with &quot;April Love&quot; (both 1957).

Fox set up a record company in South Africa and started talks with Roulette Records to form a partnership in the US but talks fell through and Fox decided to set up their own company in the US.

===20th Fox Records===
20th Fox Records was established in 1958 with Henry Onorati at its head; Onorati was hired away from Dot Records to run the new label. Onorati brought with him &quot;Carol of the Drum,&quot; a Katherine K. Davis Christmas carol that had been recorded at Dot, but not released; it was retooled as &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; and issued on 20th Fox as a single by the Harry Simeone Chorale. It became a Christmas standard in short order and put the label on a sound footing. During Onorati&#x27;s tenure, 20th Fox was at its most ambitious and the album program was oriented towards an adult audience, whereas the singles attempted, without much success, to crack the sales charts.

20th Fox albums often appeared in deluxe packaging, and sometimes the film soundtrack albums featured narration or were bridged with dialog from the films.

Other releases, such as those featuring Glenn Miller, George Gershwin, and Shirley Temple, were sourced from vault film elements. 20th Fox also featured new albums by veteran artists such as Eubie Blake, Claude Hopkins and Stuff Smith; Hugo Winterhalter made his debut as a leader on 20th Fox.

In 1962, Onorati resigned from 20th Fox and went back to Dot; his last 20th Fox project was the soundtrack album for &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. Onorati was replaced by Basil J. Bova.

===20th Century Fox Records===
Upon assuming the top job at 20th Fox, Basil Bova&#x27;s first order of business was to quell rumors that the label planned to merge with Cameo-Parkway Records. In May 1963, Bova renamed 20th Fox Records as 20th Century-Fox Records and the label design was changed to incorporate the movie studio logo. 20th Century Fox was unusual in that its singles and album programs were separate entities; whereas the singles exploited pop and novelty fare, the album program was considerably more adult and represented a continuation of the plan Onorati had originally devised for the label. Exceptions include albums based around successful singles, such as &quot;Sing We Now of Christmas&quot; which included &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; by The Harry Simeone Chorale, &quot;Navy Blue&quot; by Diane Renay and two albums by Mary Wells who enjoyed five mid-chart hits in 1964 and 1965.

Bova anticipated that the soundtrack album for &quot;Cleopatra&quot; would be &quot;the blockbuster of them all&quot;. Appearing before the film&#x27;s release by about two months in June 1963, the soundtrack debuted at #2 on the Billboard album chart and sold steadily. But the film opened to losses so great that belt-tightening was felt throughout the studio structure, and in 1965 it reached the record label. The 20th Century Fox studio closed its newsreel division in 1963, cutting off the label&#x27;s access to documentary audio for use in a series of current events albums, and tentative steps towards branching out into folk music and psychedelic rock were stopped altogether.

From 1966, ABC Records handled distribution of 20th Century Fox Records, and the label issued soundtrack LPs only, but also briefly instituted a budget subsidiary, Movietone Records, to handle back catalog.

20th Century Fox Records enjoyed one more hit album with the soundtrack to &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, though it did not contain Dionne Warwick&#x27;s version of the film&#x27;s theme. They also released the soundtrack to &quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, starring Barbra Streisand, among other film-related projects.

In 1970, the 20th Century Fox studio shut down the record label, though ABC Records still continued to distribute stock on &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, a repackaging of &quot;Sing We Now of Christmas&quot;.

===20th Century Records===

The label was dormant (with ABC Records distributing the label&#x27;s back catalog during that time) from 1970 to early 1972, when the label was revived as 20th Century Records by Russ Regan on a budget of $1 million a year for the first 3 years.

The first three acts signed to the 20th Century label were The DeFranco Family, Maureen McGovern, and Barry White; however, Brighter Side of Darkness gave the newly renamed label their first hit record in 1973 with &quot;Love Jones&quot;. The label also had major hits with Barry White&#x27;s The Love Unlimited Orchestra, Love Unlimited, Carl Douglas (best known for the song &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot;), Edwin Starr, Stephanie Mills, Leon Haywood, Carl Carlton and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack in 1977. The label also released the debut album from The Alan Parsons Project in 1976 in most of the world except Europe.

===Other projects===
The company also re-released the Harry Simeone Chorale&#x27;s recording of &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; and the album on which it was first featured, &quot;Sing We Now of Christmas&quot;, later reissued as &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (this was part of the first 1958-era label series). It became the best selling Christmas album of all time. The rights were later acquired by PolyGram, which released it on CD in 1988, on the Mercury Records label.

Among the movie soundtrack albums released by 20th Century Fox Records were those of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot;, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;, and &quot;Patton&quot;, all of them 20th Century Fox films. However, the label did not issue the soundtrack albums of any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein films released by the studio. Instead, the albums made from five of these films were released by Capitol Records (&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot; due to star Shirley Jones&#x27; recording contract and &quot;The King and I&quot; due to contractual obligations of Yul Brynner), and the remaining two albums by RCA Victor (&quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; due to stars Mitzi Gaynor&#x27;s and Julie Andrews&#x27; recording contracts with that label). Years later, the Capitol albums reappeared on CD in expanded versions issued by Angel Records. (The film versions of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;, although released in roadshow format by the Magna Corporation, were given general release by 20th Century Fox.)

===Later years===
In 1966, Fox had a deal with ABC Records for distribution and until 1970, this partnership enjoyed success. By 1970, with the parent 20th Century Fox in financial trouble (which eventually led to discontent that resulted in the ousting of Darryl Zanuck), the new output of the record company dropped to zero. Although albums that had been selling were distributed by ABC Records, no new product was forthcoming and 20th Century-Fox then shut down its record subsidiary.

It was re-activated in 1972 as 20th Century Records and designed a smart new blue label with a new logo. Russ Regan, a veteran &quot;record man&quot;, became the new head of the label, a move that increased their credibility in the business considerably. Promotion seemed better, too, as the first two singles issued by the new incarnation both charted. Their biggest selling artist at the time, Barry White, scored two number one hits with &quot;Love&#x27;s Theme&quot; with Love Unlimited Orchestra and his own &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot;. 20th Century-Fox had budgeted a million dollars a year for three years to support the revived label, but it began paying its own way after only six months.

In 1976, Russ Regan left to form his own Parachute Records label which was distributed by Casablanca Records (Regan folded Parachute in mid-1979, and, ironically, Casablanca would later redistribute 20th Century&#x27;s back catalog after PolyGram bought the label). Barry White then set up his own label, Unlimited Gold Records, through CBS, which had performed the pressing duties for 20th since 1972, after he chose not to renew his contract with Fox in 1978.

The company reverted to 20th Century-Fox Records with a new label design featuring the movie studio&#x27;s logo and launched a new distribution deal for Carl Davis&#x27; Chi Sound Records in 1978 after leaving their deal with United Artists Records. In 1979, RCA Records took over distribution of the label.

===Closure===
Managerial and operational control of the label were sold to PolyGram in April 1982; the company acquired its catalog in July. Oil magnate Marvin Davis, who had acquired 20th Century Fox, was not interested in the record company, hence its sale. All of its catalog and contracts for then-current artists including Stephanie Mills, Dusty Springfield and Carl Carlton were transferred to Casablanca Records, which PolyGram had purchased in 1977. In 1986, PolyGram dissolved Casablanca Records, moving that label&#x27;s entire catalogue to Mercury Records.

Universal Music Group, the successor of PolyGram, now owns the old 20th Century-Fox Records catalog with reissues handled by Universal Music Enterprises (UMe), on behalf of Mercury Records/Republic Records. Soundtracks that 20th Century Fox owned are controlled by Fox Music (now Hollywood Records) but are often licensed to other entities for reissues.

==Fox Music Records==

It was launched in 1992 as Fox Records in a joint venture with BMG Music. One of the artists of the label was Jamie Foxx. It folded again in 1995.

Fox Music licensed music heard on Fox feature films or TV shows to other record companies. For example, the rights to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Titanic&quot; are licensed to Sony Music. Also, &quot;Glee&quot; cast albums are licensed to Sony Music&#x27;s Columbia Records in a 50/50 venture with 20th Century Fox. These albums were issued using the 20th Century Fox TV Records imprint, which was launched in 2009 and distributed by Columbia.

In 2019, Fox Music was absorbed into the Disney Music Group upon The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s absorption of parent company 21st Century Fox. Disney Music Group is distributed by Universal Music, which owns the 20th Century Fox Records catalog.

<text>2 Tone Records was an English independent record label that mostly released ska and reggae-influenced music with a punk rock and pop music overtone. It was founded by Jerry Dammers of the Specials and backed by Chrysalis Records.

== History ==
Jerry Dammers of the ska revival band the Specials started the record label in 1979. Chrysalis had wanted to sign the Specials, but Dammers arranged a label deal, for Chrysalis to fund 15 singles a year and release at least ten of those.

The label spawned the 2 Tone music and cultural movement, which was popular among skinheads, rudies and some mod revivalists. The label stopped operating in 1986, though &quot;2 Tone&quot; is still used as an imprint for back catalogue issues. 2 Tone Records signed the Selecter, Madness and The Beat, but they all left within two years. 2 Tone Records acts signed a contract that allowed them to leave the label after releasing just one single, which was unusual in the record industry. Madness and The Beat both took advantage of this clause; the former to sign to Stiff Records, and the latter to start their own label, Go Feet Records.

Although 2 Tone Records was closely identified with the ska revival, efforts were made to broaden the label&#x27;s musical output, releasing recordings by artists such as singer-songwriter Elvis Costello and the funk-punk band the Higsons.

Dammers, with the assistance of Horace Panter and graphic designers John &quot;Teflon&quot; Sims and David Storey, created artwork that was to become central to 2 Tone Records. The logo portrays a man in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, pork pie hat, white socks and black loafers. Named &quot;Walt Jabsco&quot;, the fictional character was based on a photograph of Peter Tosh, a former member of the Wailers. Walt got his name from an old American bowling shirt that Dammers owned. He influenced the design of an emoji (originally meant to depict a suited man doing the pogo): .

<doc id="975147" wikidata="Q2725639" url="?curid=975147" title="McChicken">
<text>The McChicken is a chicken burger sold by the international fast food restaurant McDonald&#x27;s. It consists of a toasted wheat bun, a breaded patty, shredded lettuce and mayonnaise.

==History==
The burger, originally introduced in 1980, proved to be a sales disappointment and was later replaced with the highly successful Chicken McNuggets. However, following the success of McNuggets, the McChicken was reintroduced in 1988. McDonald&#x27;s again removed the McChicken from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996, replacing it with the Crispy Chicken Deluxe, which was part of McDonald&#x27;s ill-fated Deluxe line of burgers. The McChicken was phased back in gradually over the later months of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions. In the United States, the burger&#x27;s size has shrunk over time to maintain a consistent price point, as it is a longtime staple of the &quot;Dollar Menu &amp; More&quot; (previously just the Dollar Menu), which offers various food products starting at US$1.00.

The meat of the McChicken was originally a mix of 50% white meat and 50% dark meat. Viewed in April 2015, McDonald&#x27;s website states that the McChicken contains a blend of dark and white meat chicken.

==Variants==
In certain regions and at specific McDonald&#x27;s franchises, the McChicken is adapted to appeal to the local population&#x27;s tastes.

===Spiced ===
When the McChicken was reintroduced to McDonald&#x27;s menu in mid-to-late 1997 as a smaller burger, it was initially marketed as the Cajun (Style) McChicken. The name was changed back to just McChicken around 2001, alongside the change to a milder, softer chicken patty.

In the south and southwestern parts of the US, the Hot &#x27;n Spicy variant is sold. It originated as a nationwide menu item in January 2006, but by June of that year, McDonald&#x27;s confirmed it had been discontinued due to slow sales. In March 2013, McDonald&#x27;s re-introduced the Hot &#x27;n Spicy across the country to what was then called the Dollar Menu. In November 2013, as part of the chain&#x27;s Dollar Menu &amp; More revamp, the McChicken (and the Hot &#x27;n Spicy) could be ordered as a Buffalo Ranch McChicken, which is a McChicken with Buffalo and Ranch sauce instead of mayonnaise, or a Bacon Buffalo Ranch, which is a Buffalo Ranch McChicken with bacon. As of June 2015, the &quot;Hot &#x27;n Spicy&quot; is no longer available nationally.

The Jalapeño Cheddar McChicken, a McChicken with jalapeño peppers sauce and a slice of white cheddar cheese, was available in 2011 and 2012.

McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Hong Kong, Singapore and India serve a McSpicy variant, with a larger, crispier patty with increased spiciness and flavor. The spicy variant is also available as the &quot;Double McSpicy&quot;, which consists of two spicy chicken patties.

Outlets in Taiwan serve the Hot n&#x27; Spicy variant, which is available on a traditional bread bun or a formed rice bun, while locations in Malaysia serve a variant similar to the McSpicy called the Spicy Chicken McDeluxe but with a cornmeal bun.

===Teriyaki, cheddar and more===
In Hawaii, the Ala Moana Shopping Center McDonald&#x27;s sells the &quot;McTeriChicken&quot; variant, a McChicken with teriyaki (&quot;teri&quot;) sauce. &quot;Teri&quot; is heavily used in Hawaii and has been added to various McDonald&#x27;s burgers, such as the &quot;McTeri Burger&quot;.

In other US states, there is also another variant of the McChicken burger called the &quot;Cheddar Onion McChicken&quot;, which is a McChicken with caramelized onions and a slice of white cheddar cheese, both on a toasted bun.
In most countries outside of the US (such as India), the McChicken comes on a sesame-seed bun and is not spicy. In Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia (where it originally appeared as a promotional menu item but, due to its popularity, became a full-time menu item) and New Zealand, the McChicken also comes on a sesame-seed bun but with lettuce and a seasoned mayonnaise sauce called &quot;McChicken Sauce&quot;.

In the UK, the &quot;Junior Chicken&quot; is sold as the &quot;Mayo Chicken&quot;.

In Canada, the low-priced chicken option is called the &quot;Junior Chicken&quot;, which generally costs C$3.89, but the burger is only lightly spiced. It is referred to as the cousin of the Canadian McChicken, which in turn is more akin to the US&#x27; Premium Crispy Chicken burger (though the latter is served on an artisan roll, instead of the sesame seed bun of its Canadian counterpart).

McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Spain serve a variant with barbecue sauce rather than mayonnaise.

<doc id="975152" wikidata="Q254962" url="?curid=975152" title="Sarah Harding">
<text>Sarah Harding (born Sarah Nicole Hardman; 17 November 1981 – 5 September 2021) was an English singer, model and actress. Her professional career began in 2002 when she successfully auditioned for the ITV reality series &quot;&quot;, during which Harding won a place in the girl group Girls Aloud. The group achieved twenty consecutive top ten singles (including four number ones) in the UK, six albums that were certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), two of which went to number one in the UK, and accumulated a total of five BRIT Award nominations. In 2009, Girls Aloud won &quot;Best Single&quot; with their song &quot;The Promise&quot;.

During the group&#x27;s break, Harding began acting, appearing in &quot;Bad Day&quot;, the BBC television film &quot;Freefall&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; and &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s 2: The Legend of Fritton&#x27;s Gold&quot;. Harding contributed three solo songs to the soundtrack of &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s 2&quot;. She also modelled for Ultimo lingerie. In late 2012, she reunited with Girls Aloud to celebrate their tenth anniversary. In early 2013, they announced that they had split up. In 2015, Harding briefly appeared in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and released her first extended play record &quot;Threads&quot;. She then won &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 20&quot; in 2017.

In August 2020, Harding announced that she had been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer; she revealed in March 2021 that her condition was terminal. She died on 5 September 2021, at the age of 39.

==Early life==
Harding was born as Sarah Nicole Hardman on 17 November 1981 in Ascot, Berkshire. She attended St Cuthbert&#x27;s Primary School in Egham until 1993. She was raised with two half brothers and moved to Stockport when she was 14 after her parents&#x27; separation. Harding&#x27;s father had begun dating a younger woman, she therefore disowned her father and changed her surname to Harding. She attended Hazel Grove High School from 1993 to 1998 and later attended Stockport College where she studied hair and beauty. She then worked as part of the promotions team for two nightclubs in The Grand Central Leisure Park in Stockport, as a waitress at Pizza Hut, a van driver, debt collector and as a BT telephone operator. She also toured North West England performing at pubs, social clubs and caravan parks to support herself. In 2002, she was recording dance tracks when she decided to audition for UK talent-search shows. She auditioned for &quot;Fame Academy&quot; and &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;. It was in the latter on which she found fame, pulling out of &quot;Fame Academy&quot; after being accepted into the first round of &quot;Popstars&quot;. Harding also entered &quot;FHM&quot;″s High Street Honeys 2002, the magazine&#x27;s national beauty contest. Her pictures appeared in the top 100, but Harding withdrew upon achieving success on &quot;Popstars&quot;.

==Career==
===2002–2009: &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot; and Girls Aloud===

In 2002, Harding auditioned for the reality television show &quot;&quot;. The programme, the second British series of the international &quot;Popstars&quot; franchise, would see the creation of two rival groups – a boy band and a girl group each consisting of five members, which would then compete against each other for the 2002 Christmas Number One spot on the UK Singles Chart. Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Geri Halliwell. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. Harding joined Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002.

The group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one. Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between formation and reaching number one. The group released their debut album &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot; have charted at number one. Two of their albums have reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album &quot;The Sound of Girls Aloud&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Out of Control&quot;, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.
They also achieved seven certified albums and have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for &quot;The Promise&quot;.

The group&#x27;s musical style was pop, but throughout their career, they experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud&#x27;s collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists them as &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for &quot;Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group&quot; in the 2008 edition and are credited again for &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom&#x27;s biggest-selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone.

In 2006, Harding signed a £100,000 deal to model Ultimo lingerie, following the likes of Penny Lancaster, Rachel Hunter and Helena Christensen. Alongside her Girls Aloud bandmates, Harding made a cameo appearance in &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; in 2007. She took on her first major acting role in 2008, appearing in the low-budget thriller &quot;Bad Day&quot;. Harding wore a brunette wig for the role of Jade Jennings. The film also stars Donna Air and Claire Goose. She also collaborated with London synthpop band Filthy Dukes on a cover of &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, recorded for the film &quot;Wild Child&quot;. In July 2009, Girls Aloud announced they would take a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects, but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010.

During Girls Aloud&#x27;s hiatus, Harding decided to focus on her acting career. &quot;Singing was always my main ambition, but acting was something else I wanted to achieve&quot;, Harding said. Harding appeared in the BBC television film &quot;Freefall&quot;, written and directed by Dominic Savage. The film aired on BBC Two on 14 July 2009. Harding portrayed Sam, the beautician girlfriend of Dominic Cooper&#x27;s character. The drama is a satirical take on the financial crisis of 2007–2008. &quot;Company&quot; magazine said that &quot;Sarah Harding showed she&#x27;s got real acting potential in her convincing, but fleeting performance.&quot;

Later that year, Harding returned to the &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot; franchise with a starring role in &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s 2: The Legend of Fritton&#x27;s Gold&quot;. Despite her age, Harding portrayed teenage rebel Roxy, a new student at St. Trinian&#x27;s School. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, holding a 10% &#x27;rotten&#x27; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Harding worked with Girls Aloud producers Xenomania to record three solo tracks for the film&#x27;s soundtrack – &quot;Too Bad&quot;, &quot;Make It Easy&quot; and a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;.

===2009–2015: Reunion with Girls Aloud, disbandment and acting===
In December 2009, Harding appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Sarah Harding in 24 Hours&quot;. Harding and her then-boyfriend, DJ Tom Crayne, also launched a new nightclub named Kanaloa. Harding&#x27;s guest vocals appear alongside Kanobby on the Roger Sanchez and Far East Movement track &quot;2Gether&quot;; she also appears in snippets of the music video. Harding then filmed &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; in which she played one of the wives of the lead character, John Smith. The film was released on 14 February 2013.

After three years of hiatus, &quot;Girls Aloud&quot; reunited in 2012 to celebrate their tenth anniversary together. The group released the single &quot;Something New&quot; in November, with proceeds being donated to Children in Need. Their second greatest hits anthology &quot;Ten&quot; was released on 26 November 2012, followed by the single &quot;Beautiful Cause You Love Me&quot;. In 2013, the group embarked on . Shortly after the tour, the group announced their split.

Harding first revealed that she was working on her debut album in March 2010. She named Lady Gaga as her biggest influence. Despite this, an album never materialised. Harding restated her plans to release a solo album in 2013 and said that she had been &quot;writing and experimenting with different sounds in the studio.&quot; In an interview in 2014. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m doing all sorts of stuff at the moment [...] A lot of it is music, music, music.&quot;. In July 2015 her first solo release, &quot;Threads&quot;, was announced; it was released on 7 August.

She made a guest appearance on the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Joni Preston, the wife of Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill). The character made a few appearances in July and August 2015 as her marriage to Robert disintegrated when he began an affair with ex-wife Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford).

In 2014, Harding competed on the BBC&#x27;s Saturday night gymnastics show &quot;Tumble&quot;, in which she came third. She also participated in season 10 of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; in 2015.

On 16 August 2015, Harding released her debut single, &quot;Threads&quot;. It debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Physical Singles Chart, one week later.

===2016–2021: Final projects before death===
Harding took part on the third series of &quot;The Jump&quot; on Channel 4 in early 2016, withdrawing on 26 February (Week 5) after tearing a ligament in her knee during a training session. In Autumn 2016, Harding appeared alongside Andy Moss in a UK tour of &quot;&quot;. However, she was replaced mid-tour by Carolyn Maitland after pulling out due to the subsequent pain from her injury after &quot;The Jump&quot;. In August 2017, Harding won the twentieth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

On 18 March 2021, Harding released a memoir, &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;, documenting her life and career as well as her cancer diagnosis.

On 24 March 2021, Harding released her final single, &quot;Wear It Like a Crown&quot;, which she had recorded ten years earlier. However, she had found it and decided to release it with the profits going towards her chosen charity. The same day, the song went straight to number 1 on the iTunes chart. Although the single failed to chart on the UK Official Singles Top 100, it debuted and peaked at number 30 on the UK Official Singles Downloads Chart Top 100 on 2 April 2021.

===Posthumous releases===
In November 2024, Girls Aloud released &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand By You (Sarah&#x27;s Version)&quot; in aid of that year&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot;. The single features previously unreleased vocals from Harding, singing the lead in the verses. An official music video premiered on the same day as the single&#x27;s release.

==Personal life==
Harding was in an on-and-off relationship with Calum Best from 2005 to 2006. They remained friends until her death. Harding was engaged to DJ Tom Crane during 2011. She was also in a two-year relationship with DJ Mark Foster from late 2012 to late 2014. She also began a relationship with &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; co-star Chad Johnson during their series of the programme. After the pair had finished the series, they had a brief long-distance relationship but ended it, remaining friends until her death. Following her death, Johnson said that he felt sad that Harding had never been able to fulfil her dream of becoming a mother.

In October 2011, Harding entered a rehab centre in South Africa, citing alcohol dependence and depression. She did not stop drinking alcohol altogether, but &quot;reined it in&quot;. On 16 April 2013, Harding received a six-month driving ban and was fined £605 after police officers caught her talking on her mobile phone while she was driving through central London. Harding had nine penalty points on her licence for speeding prior to the incident.

Harding wrote a memoir, &quot;Hear Me Out&quot;, which was published in 2021, documenting her life and career as well as her terminal diagnosis.

==Illness and death==
On 26 August 2020, Harding announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer that had advanced to &quot;other parts&quot; of her body. In October 2020, it was reported that she was living with her mother in Manchester upon undergoing treatment. In March 2021, she stated that the disease was terminal and that she did not expect to &quot;see another Christmas&quot;.

Harding died of complications from breast cancer on the morning of 5 September 2021, at the age of 39. Among those who paid tributes were the other members of Girls Aloud: Nadine Coyle and Nicola Roberts said they were &quot;absolutely devastated&quot;; Kimberley Walsh added that her &quot;heart was broken&quot;; and Cheryl stated that Harding would be &quot;forever in [their] hearts&quot;. A number of celebrities took to their social media and also paid tribute to Harding. The proceeds from Harding&#x27;s final single, &quot;Wear It Like a Crown&quot;, were donated to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the Christie Hospital to fund research by the cancer treatment centre caring for Harding prior to her death.

<doc id="975161" wikidata="Q2894852" url="?curid=975161" title="Goldmoon">
<text>Goldmoon (also known as &quot;Goldmoon of the Que Shu tribe&quot; or just &quot;Goldmoon of the Que Shu&quot;) is a fictional character from the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; fantasy series of novels and role playing games, originally published by TSR, Inc. and later by Wizards of the Coast.

Introduced in the first book of the original Chronicles Trilogy, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;, written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman in 1984; Goldmoon has become a recurring character for over 16 years in multiple &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels and series, either as a protagonist or as a supporting character.

==Character background==
According to Patrick Lucien Price, author of the &quot;Bertrem&#x27;s essay on numerology&quot; section published in &quot;Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home&quot; (1987), Goldmoon was designed to be a kind and understanding female barbarian, who loved to travel, advise, and take care of others. As a high-profile member of her community, she was a natural speaker, able to inspire others to reach for their goals.

The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels do not cover Goldmoon&#x27;s childhood, although her birth date, February 5, 322 A.C. (&quot;Alt Cataclius&quot; or &quot;After Cataclysm&quot;) can be found in the &quot;Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home&quot; source book. Different novels and short stories agree that her parents are Arrowthorn, Chieftain of the Que Shu—a tribe located in the plains of Abanasinia, a desolate area in the central western area of Ansalon in the fictional world of Krynn—and Tearsong, deceased high priestess of the tribe.
The short story &quot;Heart of Goldmoon&quot;, written by Laura Hickman and Kate Novak and published in the &quot;Love and War&quot; (1987) recompilation, gives insight about her life after her mother died, explaining that the Que Shu community is built around the figure of a high priestess, and whoever marries the priestess becomes Chieftain of the tribe, with the first daughter of the couple becoming the next priestess.
The focus of the story is Goldmoon journeying to the &quot;Hall of the Sleeping Spirits&quot;, the place where the tombs of her ancestors are kept, to commune with their spirits in order to become the high priestess of the tribe. The journey ends with an exchange of confirmation of love between Goldmoon and Riverwind, a shepherd who was acting as her bodyguard during the travel, as well as the meeting between Goldmoon and Tearsong&#x27;s spirit, in which Goldmoon is taught about the ancient gods and given a task in the name of Mishakal, goddess of healing, which she later fulfills.
At the end of the short story it is stated that Riverwind will be taking the &quot;Courting quest&quot;, a task he must finish before being able to marry Goldmoon.

Paul B. Thompson and Tonya C. Cook explain this quest in the novel &quot;Riverwind the Plainsman&quot; (1990), from the &quot;Tales&quot; series, in which he succeeded in bringing back a Blue Crystal Staff, proof that the ancient gods existed.
However, the staff was not accepted as a valid proof by the tribe, and as related by Weis and Hickman in &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984), moments before he was stoned by the tribe, Goldmoon embraced him, and they both vanish from the village.
Reappearing just outside the city of Solace, they decide to travel, to look for someone who could tell them more about the staff, which marks the proper beginning of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; trilogy.

Character art was first created by Clyde Caldwell for a calendar, and Goldmoon has also been illustrated by such artists as Larry Elmore and Keith Parkinson. According to Elmore, Margaret Weis&#x27;s reaction to Caldwell&#x27;s first drawing was very negative; Weis said Goldmoon looked like &quot;a whore&quot;. Elmore subsequently attempted to allay Weis&#x27;s concerns, and drew the character for a book cover to appear less &quot;sexy&quot;, adding leather pants. He and Parkinson collaborated on Goldmoon illustrations for a long time afterwards. Weis reportedly appreciated Parkinson&#x27;s attempt to incorporate Weis&#x27;s vision of Goldmoon as &quot;Native American with a Celtic touch&quot;. Both Weis and Tracy Hickman continued to consult about the artwork, but Weis was always the one more invested in a particular vision.

==Development through the series==

===Chronicles trilogy===

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman introduce Goldmoon in chapter 3 of &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; (1984), titled &quot;Knight of Solamnia. The old man&#x27;s party.&quot; She is presented as a heavily cloaked, silvery-gold haired woman carrying a plain staff, accompanied by a tall stone-faced barbarian. The authors explain that shortly after their arrival to the Inn of the Last Home a fight breaks out and the true nature of her healing staff is revealed, forcing the barbarians and a group of friends to run away. It is after escaping with the barbarians that the friends realize Goldmoon&#x27;s desire of traveling to Haven, where she hoped the &quot;Seekers&quot;, priests who were in search of the old gods but degenerated into a political movement, would be able to teach her about the healing staff.

In the following chapters, Weis and Hickman continue to make the female barbarian the main focus of the story, stating that she discovered two constellations were missing from the firmament, and then revisiting when the staff protected Riverwind when the tribe was going to stone him. However, her protagonism fades in the battle sequences that follow, where she is protected by Riverwind, Sturm Brightblade, a Squire of the Knights of Solamnia and Tanis Half-Elven, the leader of the group. This behavior becomes constant throughout the rest of the series.

The authors give the story a harder push when they explain the group, later known as the Heroes of the Lance, travels to Xak Tsaroth, which is the broken city where Riverwind previously found the magical staff. The sixteenth chapter, &quot;A bitter choice. The greatest gift.&quot; presents the earlier conversation between Goldmoon and her deceased mother, Tearsong, and an appearance of Mishakal, goddess of healing and protector of the &quot;Blue Crystal Staff&quot; Goldmoon carries, in which she explains the different sacrifices Goldmoon must make in order to obtain the goddess&#x27; gift and the tasks she must fulfill, including the retrieval of the Disks of Mishakal, a sacred book of platinum with the teachings of Paladine, highest god of light in Krynn within it.
The novel continues, indicating that Goldmoon receives the power of healing before the goddess departs, which Goldmoon promptly uses to save a mortally wounded Riverwind after an encounter against Khisanth, a black dragon protecting the broken city.

Goldmoon reaches the peak of attention when the authors write about her apparent sacrifice to defeat Khisanth, during the retrieval of the &quot;Disks of Mishakal&quot;. However, it is soon explained that her sacrifice was the last test the goddess Mishakal needed from her, and as the group nears the exit of the dungeon, they find Goldmoon waiting for them, blessed by the deity as a true cleric of Mishakal with the power of calling upon Mishakal&#x27;s help when in need.

Fulfilling her final mission, Goldmoon delivers the &quot;Disks of Mishakal&quot; to a former &quot;Seeker&quot;, Elistan, whom the group meets in Pax Tharkas after they have been captured by the Dragonarmies of Ansalon, the forces of evil invading the continent of Ansalon. In this way, at the end of the book, Goldmoon marries Riverwind in a valley not far from Pax Tharkas after their group defeated Lord Verminaard in Pax Tharkas and freed the slaves.
The marriage vows the characters take are based in the Mormonism Celestial marriage.

Her involvement in the last two books of the trilogy—and therefore during the War of the Lance—abruptly diminishes at the beginning of the second book, &quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot; (1985). Her appearances are mostly to give counsel, spread the teachings of Mishakal and order new clerics. During the second half of the last book, &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot; (1985), Goldmoon learns she is pregnant. Her goodbye to Laurana Kanan in Kalaman is her last appearance in the Chronicles trilogy.

Goldmoon is instrumental in reviving the faith of the people of Krynn during a period when the gods have seemingly disappeared. According to Tracy Hickman, &quot;The restoration of truth and faith are Goldmoon&#x27;s central theme and, to a great extent, the theme of this first book in the series.&quot;

===Legends trilogy===
Although the series focus heavily on Caramon and Raistlin Majere, Riverwind makes an appearance at the beginning of the first book of the &quot;Legends&quot; trilogy, &quot;Time of the Twins&quot; (1986), written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and published by TSR, in which he is recognized as leader of the Que Shu and other barbarian tribes by wearing the &quot;Mantle of the Chieftain&quot;.

This apparition is also used by the authors to explain the current situation of the couple. With a two-year-old son—Wanderer—and twin daughters—Moonsong and Brightdawn—the couple have worked hard to join the different tribes of Abanasinia, their homeland. It is finally explained that Goldmoon is spreading the teachings of her patron deity there, but nothing more is said about her.

===Chaos War series===
Goldmoon was not specifically included in the Chaos War, an event in which the mad god Chaos tries to destroy the world of Krynn. However, in &quot;Spirit of the Wind&quot; (1998), Chris Pierson explains that Wanderer, Riverwind and Goldmoon&#x27;s son, has a three-year-old son, Cloudhawk, but nobody remembers his mother. The author hints that Goldmoon&#x27;s tribe was attacked by &quot;shadow wights&quot;, chaotic creatures that banish anyone they possess to utter oblivion, destroying even memories from others about the person in question. This hint is given through Wanderer&#x27;s sisters, Moonsong and Brightdawn, when they speculate that one such creature killed her.
The novel ends with the death of Brightdawn and Riverwind while fighting the red dragon overlord Malystryx, and Moonsong scarred forever, events that weighted heavily on Goldmoon&#x27;s spirit.

===The Fifth Age series===
The Age of Mortals starts at the end of &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; (1996) novel, with the departure of the krynnish gods and the banishment of magic and clerical powers known to Krynn until that moment. Needing a new source of power, a special kind of magic named &quot;mysticism&quot; is created based on previous abilities found in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels.

Jean Rabe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Silver Stair&quot; (1999) explains how Goldmoon, following a recurrent dream, travels to the Isle of Schallsea with Jasper Fireforge, where she finds the fabled &quot;Silver Stairs&quot;, an endless stair that was thought to be a portal to reach Solinari, the white moon of Krynn. The novel reveals that while climbing it, she experiences a new vision about the &quot;Power of the Heart&quot;, a special magic that would come to replace the one provided by the gods of old
and which she first discovered while healing a dying Jasper, three years before in Solace.

The novel continues explaining the different difficulties the group had to establish a camp, while at the same time introducing a branch of mysticism, &quot;dark mysticism&quot;, which was discovered by Goldmoon&#x27;s wish to talk with Riverwind. From that point Goldmoon continued using it to communicate with Riverwind&#x27;s spirit, although conversations between the couple are usually kept secret from the reader. Other authors like Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman made use of that bond between the couple in subsequent books.

By the end of the novel she has managed to found the Citadel of Light, which was established as the healing center of Ansalon.
Because of this, Goldmoon has been used by &quot;Dragonlance&quot; authors to first bring clerical healing from the gods of good back to Krynn during the Fourth Age, and then to bring mysticism during the Fifth Age.

===Dragons of a New Age trilogy===

Goldmoon&#x27;s most controversial appearance was in the Dragons of a New Age trilogy, written by Jean Rabe between 1996 and 1998, in which it is related the coming of the &quot;Dragon Overlords&quot;, dragons of exceptional size and power, to the world of Krynn.

In &quot;The Dawning of a New Age&quot; (1996), the first book of the series, Jean Rabe indicates that Goldmoon appears as an illusion to Dhamon Grimwulf, a former Knight of Takhisis, summoning him to the Last Heroes&#x27; Tomb, the tomb where the heroes of the Chaos War are kept. The author gives the reader, at that point, the guidelines for Dhamon&#x27;s mission throughout the trilogy.

The author keeps Goldmoon&#x27;s interventions small, especially through visions and communications with Jasper Fireforge and Palin Majere, until the second half of the second book in the series, &quot;The Day of the Tempest&quot; (1997), when the party of adventurers arrives at the Citadel of Light. It is here when the author details how an enchanted Dhamon is forced to slay Goldmoon.

The prologue of the last book in the trilogy, &quot;The Eve of the Maelstrom&quot; (1998), relates a shortened version of Goldmoon&#x27;s death, adding her travel to the afterlife and her meeting with Riverwind, her husband. However, while at the end of the second book Riverwind was expecting her, in the third book she is told that her time has not arrived yet. During the length of the book, Goldmoon appears as an encouraging voice when her friends need her. It is towards the end of the book when the author reveals how Goldmoon is brought back to Krynn, as Goldmoon tells a dying Jasper he was supposed to die in Schallsea, and that his faith and his death against Onysablet, the black dragon overlord, restores her life.

===War of Souls trilogy===

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman give Goldmoon a more prominent role during the War of Souls trilogy, when she is well over her nineties. During the first chapters of the first book, &quot;Dragons of a Fallen Sun&quot; (2000), Weis and Hickman explain how Goldmoon is transformed by a magical storm, regaining the body she had during the Chronicles trilogy. The authors use this occasion to show an angry, depressed, and bitter side of her that had not been exploited in depth before. Her new behavior is explained due her expectation to die soon and join the soul of her already deceased husband in the afterlife,
even calling this change a curse instead of a blessing.

Her protagonism increases near the end of the first book when she becomes the first character to discover that the souls of dead people are draining the magic from clerics, mages, and dragons, giving the reader the first solid reference of the reason about why magic has been weakening in the world of Krynn.
The initial shock is replaced with the unexplained urge of following the &quot;River of Souls&quot;, also referred as the &quot;river of the dead&quot;, the continuous stream of wandering souls moving towards an unknown meeting location. Goldmoon spends the end of the first book and most of the second book, &quot;Dragons of a Lost Star&quot; (2001), following the stream until arriving to Nightlund, where the Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas was hidden.

The final chapter of the second book relates the meeting between Goldmoon and an orphaned girl she found in the Isle of Schallsea whom she had raised and trained in the clerical arts, Mina. Mina now serves the One God, or Takhisis in disguise, in her attempt to bring the &quot;true gods&quot; back to Krynn, like what Goldmoon did many years ago. During this meeting the reader is revealed that Goldmoon&#x27;s body was restored by Takhisis, evil goddess of darkness, through Mina&#x27;s prayer. However, refusing to become Takhisis&#x27; herald, the goddess drains the life out of Goldmoon and orders Mina to secure her corpse in an amber sarcophagus.

In the first chapter of the last book of the trilogy, &quot;Dragons of a Vanished Moon&quot; (2002), Weis and Hickman rehearse Goldmoon and Mina&#x27;s meeting, and is the last time Goldmoon is seen alive in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series. From that point, it is explained that her soul was enslaved and forced to join the other magic draining ghosts. Throughout this book she is only present as a body in a coffin that is being carried to the &quot;Temple of Huerzyd&quot;, where Takhisis would possess it to spread the word of her return, confident that people would worship her if one of her own greatest enemies, Goldmoon, has been converted.

In the last chapter of the book, the authors explain that her spirit is freed after Takhisis is defeated, and has joined her friends&#x27; souls to travel to the afterlife.
Her death puts an end to the Heroes of the Lance, as she was the last surviving character from the original group created in 1984 by Weis and Hickman.

==Controversy==
The character of Goldmoon was killed in the Dragons of a New Age trilogy, during events explained in &quot;The Day of the Tempest&quot; novel, and resurrected in the last novel of the series, &quot;The Eve of the Maelstrom&quot;. In the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; environment, resurrection is extremely rare (with Beldinas Pilofiro, latest Kingpriest of Istar, resurrecting Cathan MarSevrin with Paladine&#x27;s intervention in &quot;Chosen of the Gods&quot; (2001), Fistandantilus through his powerful magic and his bloodstone in &quot;Fistandantilus Reborn&quot; (1997), and Raistlin Majere returning from the Abyss through Dalamar and Palin intervention in &quot;The Legacy&quot; short story in &quot;The Magic of Krynn&quot; (1987) the main examples). Although fans theorized about her death and resurrection, the matter was clarified by a mail sent to the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; list by Miranda Horner, Wizards of the Coast Web Content Developer, and in an interview with Jean Rabe, author of the trilogy.

According to Horner:
Writer Jean Rabe explained in an interview the difficulties of multiple writers working in the same fictional universe, saying she was given permission by her editor to kill off the character in one of her novels. She was forced to bring the character back to life in the very next book because others had plans for Goldmoon.

Synchronization problems between novels and gaming material, and even between novels themselves are common in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; environment where, except in few cases, the novel authors do not assist in the creation of the role playing game modules.

==Related media==

===Video games===
Goldmoon appears as one of the player characters in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;. Goldmoon can use her magical staff to restore any deceased character back to life, and she is able to perform eight additional divine miracles.

===Miniature figures===
Goldmoon was included in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine complimented the work Ral Partha did in matching the appearance of their figures to the descriptions of the characters from the novels, and described her figure: &quot;Goldmoon is standing in a relaxed position, holding a lute in her right hand and a staff and symbol in her left. The figure has long, flowing hair with braids over her shoulders. A simple blouse and belt with a buckle that blends into an elaborate, fur trimmed loin cloth and pouch complete the clothing. For outer wear, she has a full-length fur-trimmed cloak, and her buckskin boots are also fur-lined and fur-trimmed.&quot;

===Dragonlance: Fifth Age===
As part of the backstory for the &quot;&quot; game, Goldmoon &quot;has awakened to a mystic power within her own heart, fueled by the essence of life and the purity of emotion&quot;, and teaches this new form of magic throughout her land.

===Dragonlance movie===

Actress Lucy Lawless voiced Goldmoon in the 2008 animated movie,
directed by Will Meugniot, written by George Strayton and produced by &quot;Toonz Animation&quot;, &quot;Commotion Pictures&quot;, &quot;Epic Level Entertainment&quot;, &quot;Kickstart Entertainment&quot; and &quot;Paramount Pictures&quot;. Lawless said that she was directed to voice Goldmoon as a Native American, and that after extensive feedback, she was eventually asked to use the voice of Xena.

==Reception==
The character of Goldmoon has been criticized as a feminine stereotype of the &quot;placid healer&quot; rather than a fully developed fictional persona.

Lauren Davis of io9 commented on how the heroes of the &quot;Dragonlance Chronicles&quot; feel like they are a dysfunctional family, describing the Plainsfolk Riverwind and Goldmoon as &quot;so-called &quot;barbarians&quot; in a strange land&quot;.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken describes her as &quot;A barbarian and de facto chieftain of the Que-Shu tribe. She&#x27;s a priest of Mishakal, which makes her the first cleric since the Cataclysm. She bears the Blue Crystal Staff, which gives her the first healing powers in 300 years, too.&quot; Bricken identifies her as &quot;arguably the most important character in the series, as her desire to fulfill her goddess&#x27; behest drives most of the story.&quot;

<doc id="975167" wikidata="Q7170393" url="?curid=975167" title="Persistence of Memory (2008 novel)">
<text>Persistence of Memory is the tenth novel by American teen author Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and is the fifth novel in her Den of Shadows series. Published on December 9, 2008 the novel tells the story of Erin Misrahe and her struggles with her alter-ego Shevaun, who is in fact a vampire with whom Erin has a link. The novel also mentions a character from Atwater-Rhodes&#x27;s previous novel, &quot;In the Forests of the Night&quot; (1999), Alexander, the brother of the protagonist, Risika. The poem by Edgar Allan Poe entitled &quot;A Dream Within a Dream&quot; is featured in the novel.

==Summary==
Erin Mishare is a sixteen-year-old girl who has an alter-ego named Shevaun. Erin has always struggled with this and has seen many therapists but none of them can figure out why Shevaun exists. The real Shevaun is a vampire on the other side of the world. When Erin gets stressed out, Shevaun is pulled away from her body and is switched into Erin&#x27;s and vice versa, though neither is fully aware of it. When Shevaun starts realizing what is going on she sets out to kill Erin to break their connection. She, her boyfriend, and friends move to the city in which Erin lives, bringing them to the attention of the Triste witch line. Shevaun&#x27;s boyfriend, Adjila, who is a Triste witch, confronts the head of his line, Pandora asking for her help to break the connection, but Adjila refuses the request.

Eventually, the two meet and the struggle to break their link continues inside Erin&#x27;s head. It is also revealed that during the pregnancy of Erin&#x27;s mother, Shevaun had accidentally injured her which nearly caused the death of both her and her mother. Racked with guilt at the possible death of an unborn child, Adjila uses Shevaun&#x27;s healing ability as a vampire to save both the mother and the unborn Erin causing the two of them to be connected. The struggle to end the bond between Erin and Shevaun leaves Adjila unconscious and Erin on the verge of death. Pandora arrives to help revive Adjila so he can finish sorting out what he had created. Adjila with the help of Sassy, a hyena shapeshifter that Erin had befriended, save Erin, but because of the help from Sassy, this also turns Erin into a hyena shapeshifter. After all this, Erin has found a happiness among her new friends.

<text>The İsa Bey Mosque (), constructed in 1374–75, is one of the oldest and most impressive works of architectural art remaining from the Anatolian beyliks. The mosque is situated on the outskirts of the Ayasluğ Hills at Selçuk, İzmir.

==History==
It was built by the Syrian architect, &#x27;Ali b. Mushaimish al-Dimashqi, in honor of the Aydinid Isa Bey. The plans for the mosque are based on the Great Mosque of Damascus.

By 1829, the mosque was in ruins and by 1842 the minaret had fallen down. In the 19th century, it was also used as a caravanserai. There is an octagonal Seljuk türbe made of stone and bricks, with a pyramid shaped roof, right next to the mosque.

==Architecture==

The mosque has two main entrances, to the east and to the west and contains a fountain court. The western wall has inscriptions and geometric shapes engraved. These walls are covered with marble, whereas the façades on the remaining sides are made of cut stone. It is built asymmetrically on a base. The rims of its domes, with diameters of and , are decorated with İznik (Nicaea) tiles. Twelve round columns stand inside its courtyard encircled with porches. Its brick minaret is built on an octagonal base, and the upper part from the balcony is ruined. The mosque had another minaret on the west, which is totally destroyed now. The mihrab (niche or altar) was moved to another mosque, due to a door opened there.

<doc id="975219" wikidata="Q5153662" url="?curid=975219" title="Commons club">
<text>A Commons Club is a type of social organization whose membership is &quot;open&quot; rather than selective based on personal introduction and invitation. It may also refer to the lodge or other meeting facility associated with such a club and used for its activities. Usually, &quot;Commons Club&quot; refers to a type of men&#x27;s social organization which flourished at institutions of higher education in North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Principles==
Commons Clubs both emulated and differentiated themselves from fraternities and other competing social institutions. They provided a social network, but membership was usually open to anyone interested in joining. The resources of a large organization could be put to sponsoring events and activities, as well as providing dining and housing, beyond the means of an individual student. Commons Clubs over time came to identify their chief ideals as Democracy, Service, and Brotherhood.

==History==
Greek-letter literary and philosophical societies, starting with Phi Beta Kappa (est. 1779), rose at American universities as an outlet for students frustrated with the traditional curriculum centered on the classics. Some early organizations to use the phrase &quot;commons club&quot; were of this type, their name referring to the democracy and debates of the British House of Commons. In the mid-19th century, general or &quot;social&quot; fraternities supplanted the literary fraternities, to the point where &quot;independent&quot; students became disadvantaged in campus awards and activities as opposed to &quot;Greeks&quot; and considered to occupy a lower position in the social hierarchy of the time.

Four Commons Clubs federated in 1906, with clubs at Wesleyan University, Dartmouth College, Middlebury College, and Norwich University, and began the equivalent of a national organization that any of the college fraternities would have, and from this initial point, the federated organization began to grow.

The Wesleyan Commons Club was the oldest, founded in 1899. Wesleyan President Bradford Paul Raymond met with a group of non-fraternity students, to discuss the possibility of all non-fraternity students rooming and boarding together in a Wesleyan-owned building. Together, they would constitute a &#x27;college commons&#x27;. This new organization was announced in the official Wesleyan University Bulletin of June 1899 : &quot;Two conferences have been held recently by President Raymond with students interested in the formation of a commons, under the direction of College authorities. At each meeting the details of the proposed scheme were discussed at some length, and at the close of the second session the President announced that he had received pledges of membership from a sufficient number of men now in college to justify him in proceeding with the arrangement for establishing the commons next year.&quot;

The next academic year, still in 1899, sixteen non-fraternity men, led by Frederick Clark, Thomas Travis, and Herbert Ward, formally established the Wesleyan Commons Club. The university also organized the Commons Club as a boarding club, beginning with thirty-eight members, setting the price of board at $2.25 a week. The next fall, the membership increased to seventy and the college enlarged the building in which they were dining to provide meeting rooms for the group. Because of the financial aid provided, the university felt free to make a condition that all undergraduate members of the college, not belonging to fraternities, should be offered an election to the group regardless of race, color or creed.

== National Federation of Commons Clubs ==
The success of the Wesleyan Commons Club inspired the founding of similar organizations at Dartmouth College, Middlebury College, and Norwich University. These four formed the National Federation of Commons Clubs in 1906, which would add thirteen additional members by 1918 as well as numerous non-aligned Commons Clubs on campuses throughout the United States and Canada. Along with the increase in chapter memberships, went a great many improvements, following the easiest course in imitation of the older Greek-letter societies which were close at hand in every college, rather than in sticking to original principles or in making novel but difficult improvements. The Commons Clubs adopted, one after the other, most of the characteristics of the Greek-letter fraternities, not, however, without a fight at every adoption by the sterner, more democratic element in every chapter. The innovations consisted of yearly conventions, an annual magazine, initiation and installation rituals, robes, secret hand grips, badges, pennants, private fraternity houses, alumni organizations, and the like.

Because membership was open, a Commons Club could grow to a size unwieldy to govern, inadequate for forming close friendships, and unsuited to the effective advancement of their stated ideals. Factions and in some cases whole clubs split away and sought petitions from national fraternities or declared themselves a local fraternity. In 1905, ten members of the Middlebury Commons Club, including President George E. Kimball, left to form the Kappa Delta Rho national fraternity. The weak organization of the Federation itself left it vulnerable to splits along competing visions. The never-solved problems of the national order included that of financial support of an adequate system of national control and chapter assistance, without so raising the cost of membership as to defeat the democratic principles of the order; and that of maintaining an efficient and progressive national administration, while still fostering freedom of action of chapters and of individual members. Most of the national officials, by terms of the constitution, were unpaid undergraduates with little power and with scant financial allotment. National control was entirely lacking. Local autonomy allowed the chapters to develop without any spirit of national unity.

As the principles of the order became crystallized and some attempts were made to secure closer national control and similarity among the chapters, the old fight between the democratic and the progressive elements broke out in a more organized way. That is, the progressive elements in a number of chapters lined up against the democratic factions of other chapters and brought their arguments into the columns of the Chronicle and to the convention floor in 1916, 1917, and 1918.

An attempt was made by the national officers to postpone the 1918 annual convention in an effort to consolidate the interior position of the order, but the storm which had been hovering for years was far too advanced to stem. Ironically, the Wesleyan Commons Club hastened the storm by proposing in a 1917-round robin letter that the order use a Greek-letter name &quot;Phi Mu Delta.&quot; The &quot;progressives&quot; insisted upon meeting and settling the question. Only a small representation attended the convention, delegates from seven of the remaining thirteen chapters. The progressives controlled the delegates of four chapters, the democrats of three. A compromise was tried but found unacceptable to either side. The progressives insisted upon a Greek-letter name and exclusive membership policies and the democrats leaned over backwards on the fundamental democratic principles of the order and insisted that the original wide open membership plan be strictly enforced and the old name retained.

The 1918 convention split into two separate meetings, Union College, University of Connecticut, University of Vermont, and University of New Hampshire delegates retiring. Clarence Dexter Pierce, a member of the University of Vermont Commons Club, successfully sponsored a resolution to declare the Federation a Greek-letter fraternity, with its attendant structure and selectivity. The Commons Clubs at the University of Vermont, University of New Hampshire, and University of Connecticut ratified the plan, forming what is now the Phi Mu Delta national fraternity. While the Union College Commons Club intended to join its counterparts in organizing Phi Mu Delta, the group instead elected to refound the Alpha Charge of Theta Delta Chi in 1923 because of pressure from its alumni.

Those from Wesleyan, Tufts, and Massachusetts, remaining, revised the Commons Club constitution, providing for compulsory adherence to the wide open membership policies of the original Wesleyan Commons Club. The revised Commons Clubs secured the ratification of their more strict democratic constitution by the Hobart chapter and by the nominally-existing but really war-casualty St. Lawrence chapter, and with the three convention stand-patters: Wesleyan, Tufts, and Massachusetts; carried on as the National Federation of Commons Clubs. By 1928 all the remaining chapters had withdrawn from the Federation and it died.

== American Association of Commons Clubs ==
While the National Federation of Commons Clubs, as such, passed into limbo because of the indifference of the members following World War I, the Commons Club movement is still present on many campuses of the United States. Due to the zealous extension activities of the Federation&#x27;s members up to 1917, the Commons Club idea was spread widely.

The most important transplanting of this seed was in the formation of the American Association of Commons Clubs (AACC), while never actually a formal part of the federation, it is an historical descendant of it. The seed of the idea was carried to the campus of Denison University as early as 1914, during the extension campaign, and was harbored there. The resultant local Denison Commons Club was assisted by literature of the federation and by the Allegheny College chapter, at the time of its formation in 1916–17, and again in 1920 by the Federation officers, just prior to the completion of a movement at Denison University to organize a union of local Commons Clubs of the Midwest. Founded as a &quot;non-fraternity&quot; (but never anti-fraternity) organization, the Denison Commons Club sought to make available to all unaffiliated male students the advantages of fraternity life—which tended to be restricted to an exclusive segment of the campus. During the fall and winter of 1916, a group consisting of interested men met to develop an organization to provide social advantages to unaffiliated men. The President of Denison, C.W. Chamberlain, offered his support to the group. J. Thomas Allison was elected chairman, and those interested in forming an organization signed their names to a list. J. Leslie Putnam, J.T. Allison, and George B. Cressey were appointed to draw up a constitution.

The ideals for which the chapters strove were Democracy, Brotherhood, University First, Open Door, and non-Greek but not anti-Greek. Under these ideals, there were no membership restrictions based on race, creed or religion. All unaffiliated male students in good standing on campus were eligible for membership. The membership always included a wide variety of racial, national and religious—as well as social and economic—backgrounds. In line with the &quot;Open Door&quot; policy and the principles of democracy, no more than a 50 percent vote was required to elect a man to membership or qualified Pledges to Active status and entitled them to the ritual. The right to select members was thus recognized, but it was not carried to the extreme of a &quot;blackball&quot; system. Unlike most other fraternities, it took a majority vote to deny membership. The &quot;Open Door&quot; swung out as well as in, for a man could leave if he found that he did not fit in with the group or wished to join another fraternity, however, each officer took an oath not to exercise that right during his term of office. The Denison Commons Club strove to give as many men as possible the influence of fraternity life, and looked to what it could do for the man, not what he could do for the Commons Club. The Denison Commons Club was known for its inclusiveness from its very beginnings. Many of its members were minorities, biracial or otherwise disenfranchised members of society.

At a convention held in 1921 on April 22 and 23 in Granville, Ohio, delegates from the commons clubs of Denison University, Ohio University, and Hillsdale College met for the express purpose of forming a new national organization. The official delegates who gathered for this purpose were T.V. Caulkins Jr., and D.S. Cowles of the Denison Commons Club; Dennis West and W.V. Wilkerson of the Ohio University Commons Club; and Clinton Douglas and L.L. Latham of the Hillsdale College Commons Club. The Ohio Wesleyan group decided not to attend. The new organization was known official as the American Association of Commons Clubs. The new organization, commonly known as the American Commons Club, was an American letter fraternity for men without restrictions as to race, creed, or color. The American Association was augmented by a chapter at Wabash College, which was a remnant of a former Federation chapter there.

All chapters active prior to World War II succeeded in resuming operation after the war. The two in Colorado, however, were lost in 1948 and 1956. One new chapter was installed in 1949, but after a few years became weak and was asked for its charter in 1961. Many felt the Commons Club movement lost its relevance and withered in the more liberal climate of student life after World War II. With the withdrawal in 1963 of the Cincinnati Chapter, which had long been active in the Association, the remaining chapters at Denison and Adrian felt it futile to maintain a national organization with just two chapters. Accordingly, at a Special Convention held at Adrian April 4, 1964, the delegates voted unanimously to suspend national operation as of June 15. By 1964 only the founding chapter at Denison University remained, and in 1969 the American Association of Commons Clubs became an organization of only alumni while the active chapter became a member of Delta Chi national fraternity. At the time of the suspension of the Association, the national officers then current were designated as a permanent Executive Committee to act in the interests of the Association in all matters regarding protection and use of insignia, maintenance of records, disposition of assets, and other matters. These officers included the following: Allan M. Dewey (Denison &#x27;37), President; Edward G. Voss (Denison &#x27;50), General Secretary; R.A. Wiley (Adrian &#x27;50) Treasurer; and John N. Miller (Denison &#x27;54), Editor. A complete file of Association Convention proceedings, bulletins, handbooks, mimeographed documents, and publications, including The American Commoner, is deposited in the archives of the William Howard Doane Library at Denison.

== Association of Commons Clubs ==
In 1989, a new Commons Club was formed at Indiana University with the support of the alumni of the AACC. It spread to other Midwestern campuses and continues the Commons Club tradition.

==Women in the Commons Club movement==
The Allegheny College Commons Club started in 1903 as the Teutonic Association, an all-male group that included in membership all non-fraternity men. At its 1909 annual banquet, the idea of adding women to the group resulted in the formation of Teutonia Association “…for the purpose of establishing a closer social relationship and opportunity among all non-sorority women of the college. The Wittenberg University Commons Club began as a group that admitted female students as equal members of the organization. When the members of DCC first heard of this, &quot;The Denison Commoner&quot; published the following reflection:
:“There is also an organization containing both men and women at Wittenberg which claims to be patterned after the D.C.C. This is a dream, but, do you suppose that the Commons Club will have female chapters in the future? The men from Hillsdale ask if there is such a thing, stating that there is need of one at Hillsdale. Under a separate heading will appear an article telling of the formation of the Shepardson Club, doing the same thing for the women of Shepardson College that the D.C.C. does for the men of Granville College.” Before being admitted as a member of the AACC, the Wittenberg chapter decided to split the group into separate male and female organizations. It is not known what became of the female group. At Colorado State University, the AACC chapter helped to form the Valkyries Club for women that continued as a “sister” organization for the life of the chapter. At Denison, the Spring of 1920 saw the organization of the Shepardson Club, a “sister” organization to the Denison Commons Club. The women of Shepardson College that merged with Denison University at the turn of the century formed the Shepardson Club with the help of the AACC chapter at Denison. “The idea of the Shepardson Club was conceived in the minds of some freshmen. Other have seen the need, but realizing the enormity of an undertaking to remedy the situation, have gone no farther. It remained for those freshman girls to have the initiative and courage to act upon their convictions. When plans had been formulated, the good will of the sororities assured, and the approval and backing of the faculty and administration obtained, the Shepardson Club was launched. Unaffilliated upper-classmen and all freshmen were given an opportunity to join and there was an almost universal response…. The primal purpose of the organization is one of service…. Membership will not, however, prevent a girl from leaving at any time to accept a sorority bid. Through this Club there is now made possible equal social opportunities for all.” The Shepardson Club continued to share participation in many collegiate events over the years with the Denison Chapter. Eventually, it suffered from the same issues as the Denison Commons Club and ceased operations. At Ohio University, the local Commons Club attempted to copy Denison in the Spring of 1920 and form a girl’s Commons Club. 
Named after the first AACC newsletter, Trianon was another “sister” organization to the Commons Club. It formed from the mergers of three college clubs in Ohio and Indiana. First, at the University of Cincinnati, in 1925, Dean Josephine P. Simrall and a group of female students, inspired and encouraged by the Cincinnati Commons Club, created the Campus Club. Next, in November 1926, several women at Butler University formed a Campus Club on their campus. Then, in the spring of 1929, thirty-seven female students at Miami University formed the Miami Girl&#x27;s Club. Members of the three clubs convened the first National Convention on December 28 and 29, 1929, to form Trianon. In 1957, Trianon dropped open membership. The Trianon Pledge Manual explained, &quot;The definition of how a girl could become a candidate was changed from a written application to a girl being invited upon a favorable majority vote of active members.&quot; In 1959, the sorority&#x27;s official magazine creased publication. The sorority was still active in the 1960s, but the last known national convention met in 1965 and by 1974, mention of Trianon&#x27;s activities in Butler&#x27;s yearbooks ceased.

<doc id="975221" wikidata="Q1311829" url="?curid=975221" title="Isosurface">
<text>An isosurface is a three-dimensional analog of an isoline. It is a surface that represents points of a constant value (e.g. pressure, temperature, velocity, density) within a volume of space; in other words, it is a level set of a continuous function whose domain is 3-space. 

The term &quot;isoline&quot; is also sometimes used for domains of more than 3 dimensions. 

== Applications ==
Isosurfaces are normally displayed using computer graphics, and are used as data visualization methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), allowing engineers to study features of a fluid flow (gas or liquid) around objects, such as aircraft wings. An isosurface may represent an individual shock wave in supersonic flight, or several isosurfaces may be generated showing a sequence of pressure values in the air flowing around a wing. Isosurfaces tend to be a popular form of visualization for volume datasets since they can be rendered by a simple polygonal model, which can be drawn on the screen very quickly.

In medical imaging, isosurfaces may be used to represent regions of a particular density in a three-dimensional CT scan, allowing the visualization of internal organs, bones, or other structures.

Numerous other disciplines that are interested in three-dimensional data often use isosurfaces to obtain information about pharmacology, chemistry, geophysics and meteorology.

== Implementation algorithms ==

=== Marching cubes ===
The marching cubes algorithm was first published in the 1987 SIGGRAPH proceedings by Lorensen and Cline, and it creates a surface by intersecting the edges of a data volume grid with the volume contour. Where the surface intersects the edge the algorithm creates a vertex. By using a table of different triangles depending on different patterns of edge intersections the algorithm can create a surface. This algorithm has solutions for implementation both on the CPU and on the GPU.

=== Asymptotic decider ===
The asymptotic decider algorithm was developed as an extension to marching cubes in order to resolve the possibility of ambiguity in it.

=== Marching tetrahedra ===
The marching tetrahedra algorithm was developed as an extension to marching cubes in order to solve an ambiguity in that algorithm and to create higher quality output surface.

=== Surface nets ===
The Surface Nets algorithm places an intersecting vertex in the middle of a volume voxel instead of at the edges, leading to a smoother output surface.

=== Dual contouring ===
The dual contouring algorithm was first published in the 2002 SIGGRAPH proceedings by Ju and Losasso, developed as an extension to both surface nets and marching cubes. It retains a dual vertex within the voxel but no longer at the center. Dual contouring leverages the position and normal of where the surface crosses the edges of a voxel to interpolate the position of the dual vertex within the voxel. This has the benefit of retaining sharp or smooth surfaces where surface nets often look blocky or incorrectly beveled. Dual contouring often uses surface generation that leverages octrees as an optimization to adapt the number of triangles in output to the complexity of the surface.

=== Manifold dual contouring ===

Manifold dual contouring includes an analysis of the octree neighborhood to maintain continuity of the manifold surface 

== Examples ==
Examples of isosurfaces are &#x27;Metaballs&#x27; or &#x27;blobby objects&#x27; used in 3D visualisation. A more general way to construct an isosurface is to use the function representation.

<doc id="975239" wikidata="Q4259440" url="?curid=975239" title="Pasir Ris">
<text>Pasir Ris ( or ) is a planning area and residential town located in the East Region of Singapore. It is bordered by Tampines and Paya Lebar to the south, Sengkang to the southwest and Changi to the east. The planning area also shares riverine boundary with Punggol to the west, separated by the Serangoon River, as well as having a maritime boundary with the North-Eastern Islands planning area, across the Straits of Johor.

Like other new towns, public transport facilities were factored into the development of Pasir Ris. Pasir Ris is easily accessible via bus services at Pasir Ris Bus Interchange and the Mass Rapid Transit at Pasir Ris MRT station. Today, landmarks in the area include the NTUC Downtown East, Pasir Ris Beach Park and White Sands Shopping Mall.

==Etymology==
The first reference to a village of &quot;Pasir Ris&quot;, &quot;Passier Reis&quot; (or &quot;Passier Rice&quot;), appeared in early 1800s. The second part of the city name, &quot;Ris&quot;, in Malay, means &quot;bolt rope&quot;. Pasir Ris may also mean &quot;white sand&quot; in Malay. Pasir Ris Town is named after the long stretch of sandy white beach along the north-east coastline of Singapore, facing Pulau Ubin.

==History==
Pasir Ris was originally a low lying, undeveloped area with Malay kampongs like Kampong Pasir Ris, Kampong Bahru and Kampong Loyang Besar, and the various Chinese kampongs along Elias Road. The area was well known for its many plantation estates including the Singapore United Plantations, Loh Lam Estate, Hun Yeang and Thai Min Estates. The beach was a popular resort for water skiing in the 1950s. There was also the Pasir Ris Hotel, venue of many memorable parties and picnic gatherings in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.

The development of Pasir Ris Town began in 1983 with Phase 1 being an Elias Road/Pasir Ris Estate, followed by Loyang N1 and N2 by 1989–90, N4 from 1992 to 1993, N5 from 1995 and N6 in 1997 together with N7. Pasir Ris Neighbourhood 8 will begin construction after the announcement of Elias MRT station in 2021, of which MINDEF is giving up the land. Today, White Sands Shopping Centre, located next to Pasir Ris MRT station, embodies the local place name.

As part of the Remaking Our Heartland 3 (ROH3) plans, the town will be rejuvenated and envisioned as &#x27;Our Urban Sanctuary&#x27; within the next five to ten years. The plans will focus on four key areas: Town Centre, park spaces and building homes close to parks, creating new spaces, and enhancing the walking and cycling experience within the town.

A 1.2 km &#x27;Central Greenway&#x27; is planned from Pasir Ris Park, through the town centre, and ends near Costa Ris, a housing estate near the end of the Tampines Expressway. Approximately 500m will be elevated above ground, with ramps connecting it to the ground level, without having to stop and wait at the traffic lights. On top of pedestrian walkways, the &#x27;Central Greenway&#x27; will also feature bicycle paths for cyclists. This will be a feature unique only to Pasir Ris and make Pasir Ris Park even more readily accessible.

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) plans to develop 2,000 public housing units adjacent to the Pasir Ris Park, offering views of the park and Sungei Api Api. The first batch of flats have been released for sale as part of the August 2020 BTO exercise. The development is named Costa Grove and offers a total of 1,070 units, housed in nine residential blocks with varying heights from nine to eighteen storeys.

Upgrading works for the existing four neighbourhood centres will also be carried out as well as improvements in the neighbourhood parks with more amenities such as new playgrounds, sheltered linkways, and fitness corners. The neighbourhood centres up for upgrading are Loyang Point, Elias Mall, Pasir Ris West Plaza, and Neighbourhood 4 NC.

A new town centre is also in the plans where there will be a mixed development in the area, comprising residential, retail, and food and beverage outlets. This development, named Pasir Ris 8, will also be integrated with the new Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, where it will be equipped with a dedicated pick-up and drop-off point for full-time servicemen undergoing military training on Pulau Tekong. Other than a bus interchange, the integrated development will also house a polyclinic and a town plaza, serving as a community focal point for the town. The site has been awarded to a joint venture between Allgreen Properties and Kerry Properties. 

==Geography==

Loyang Industrial Estate encompasses of three subzones, Loyang West, Loyang East and Flora Drive. The Town of Pasir Ris contains within it, four subzones, Pasir Ris Central, Pasir Ris West, Pasir Ris Drive and Pasir Ris Park. Although Pasir Ris Wafer Fabrication Park is not a part of the Loyang Industrial Estate, it still functions as its own individual subzone nonetheless. In total, the entire planning area has eight subzones.

Pasir Ris has some hills less than 40 metres in height. Since 2014, these hills have been flattened to make way for upcoming residential development.

===Political boundaries===
Pasir Ris comes politically under the Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency since 2001 and Pasir Ris Group Representation Constituency from 1997 to 2001. After the general election in 2001, a large part of the former Pasir Ris Central Division and the Pasir Ris-Loyang Division came together as Pasir Ris East with Mohamed Sharael Taha as the Member of Parliament (MP) since 2020.

Pasir Ris West consists of Elias housing estate and the western area of Pasir Ris and its Member of Parliament being Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean. In conjunction with the expansion of Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency (GRC), a Community Club scaling six storeys high, was built in Pasir Ris East. In October 2004, Pasir Ris West also saw the completion of Pasir Ris Elias Community Club.

Portions of the Pasir Ris West (notably White Sands and Pasir Ris Park) were also carved ahead of the 2020 elections and formed the Pasir Ris Central division, in which Desmond Tan was the MP.

== Architecture ==
The architecture of Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks in Pasir Ris is inspired by the nearby beach and sea elements. This can be seen in the lighthouse-shaped turrets formed by columns of balconies, void deck and precinct boundary walls with porthole-shaped openings, and windows/balconies framed within clam-shaped openings.

==Amenities==
===Recreation===
In proximity to the sea, Pasir Ris has several recreation areas such as the NTUC Downtown East, chalets, Wild Wild Wet, a park for pets and pet owners and Pasir Ris Park. There is also another park by the name of Pasir Ris Town Park, close to where White Sands Shopping Mall is located. The park sports a park connector, a playground, an eatery and a fishing pond. However, a section of the park has been removed to build the Pasir Ris Central Hawker Center and Pasir Ris Sports Centre with facilities such as swimming pools, a sports hall to be used mainly for badminton, a street soccer court, and also a gym.

==== Downtown East ====

As Singapore&#x27;s premier and largest lifestyle and recreational hubs, Downtown East is a one-stop leisure, lifestyle, and dining destination for the public to enjoy a wide variety of entertainment options at affordable prices. Downtown East currently comprises D&#x27;Resort, Wild Wild Wet, Market Square (E!Avenue and E!Hub), and MUCE (Membership &amp; Union Community Engagement).

E!Hub, a four-storey shopping and entertainment complex with a cinema, was completed in 2008. The site was previously a bowling alley building. As of 2019, the Orchid Bowl bowling alley in E!Hub has been closed to expand the retail floor of the complex.

Aside from Wild Wild Wet, the area previously had another theme park, Escape Theme Park, which opened in 2000. However, it ceased operations in 2011 to make way for the expansion of Wild Wild Wet and Singapore&#x27;s first nature-inspired resort - D&#x27;Resort. Other than Escape Theme Park, Costa Sands Resort (Downtown East) also ceased operations after 25 years to make way for the expansion.

==== Lorong Halus Wetland ====
Formally a sewage disposal centre and landfill, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) converted a portion of the site into a wetland in 2011 in tandem with the construction of the Serangoon Reservoir. The Lorong Halus Wetland is located along the eastern bank of the reservoir and acts as a &quot;facility&quot; by collecting and treating water passing through the former landfill, preventing it from flowing into the clean reservoir, therefore helping to safeguard the quality of the water in the reservoir.

The wetland is a favourite bird-watching spot in the eastern side of Singapore, where there are guided walks for participants to bird-watch while discovering the relationship between clean water and a thriving wildlife. The &quot;Instagram-famous&quot; Lorong Halus Red Bridge is also located in the area, linking the wetland to the Punggol Waterway in Punggol, across the Serangoon River.

===Industry===
Pasir Ris is also part of the Jurong Town Corporation&#x27;s plan to develop wafer fabrication facilities in Singapore. The other two locations are Tampines and Woodlands. Presently, there are two major wafer fabrication parks in Pasir Ris. Companies situated there include United Microelectronics Corporation and SSMC.

===Education===
, the area has a total of 6 primary schools, 4 secondary schools and Tampines Meridian Junior College. As part of a rationalisation exercise, Coral Primary School merged with White Sands Primary School in 2019, and Loyang Primary School merged with Casuarina Primary School in the same year. Three secondary schools, Coral Secondary School, Greenview Secondary School, and Siglap Secondary School were closed down and merged with existing schools as a result of a rationalisation exercise since March 2016. There is one international school, Overseas Family School.

, the area has three shopping malls and four neighbourhood plazas; White Sands Shopping Mall, NTUC Downtown East, Pasir Ris Mall, Loyang Point, Pasir Ris Drive 6 Neighbourhood Centre, Elias Mall and Pasir Ris West Plaza. In addition, there are two community centres, Pasir Ris East and Pasir Ris Elias (Pasir Ris West).

Pasir Ris Central Hawker Center, which opened in January 2018, has 42 stalls and is the home-ground of traditional street food and hipster kitchens.

== Transportation ==

=== Road Network ===
The Tampines Expressway (TPE), which borders the area at the south, and arterial roads allows for easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the country. There are two major roads in the area, namely Pasir Ris Drive 1 and Pasir Ris Drive 3, which cuts across the entire town with several bus services plying along the two roads.

To provide ease of access for residents travelling between Pasir Ris and Punggol, Pasir Ris Industrial Drive 1 was extended in end-2019 to link up with the interchange expansion between the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and Tampines Expressway (TPE). This new link road provides an additional and more direct route between the two towns and helps to ease traffic flow on the TPE.

=== Mass Rapid Transit ===
There is currently one MRT station, Pasir Ris MRT station, serving the planning area across one line, East West line. By 2030, as part of the Cross Island line Phase 1, Pasir Ris MRT station will be an interchange with the Cross Island line. The town will also see the addition of two new stations: Loyang and Pasir Ris East, as part of the Cross Island line Phase 1.

As part of the Cross Island line&#x27;s Punggol Extension, Pasir Ris MRT station will also be the terminus for the extension when completed by 2032. As part of the extension, the town will also see the addition of one new station: Elias.

=== Bus ===

==== Bus Interchange ====

The planning area has one bus interchange, Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, serving the residents. The interchange has also been utilised as a shuttle pick-up/drop-off point for NSmen undergoing military training on Pulau Tekong. It is currently operated by Go-Ahead Singapore as part of the Loyang Bus Package under the Bus Contracting Model (BCM).

As part of the Remaking Our Heartland 3 (ROH3) plans, part of the existing bus interchange will be demolished and replaced with a reconfigured interim interchange in July 2021 to allow works for the integrated development in the town centre. A new air-conditioned bus interchange will be integrated within the development once completed by 2028.

==== Bus Depot ====

As part of the Bus Contracting Model (BCM), Loyang Bus Depot is built to house the operations of the Loyang Bus Package. The depot is currently operated by Go-Ahead Singapore and houses a total of 30 bus services mainly from Pasir Ris Bus Interchange and Punggol Bus Interchange, and a selected few from Changi Village Bus Terminal and Changi Airport PTB2 Bus Terminal.

<text>Modern rock is an umbrella term used to describe rock music that is found on college and commercial rock radio stations. Some radio stations use this term to distinguish themselves from classic rock, which is based in 1960s–1980s rock music.

==Radio format==
Modern rock (also known as alternative radio) is a rock format commonly found on commercial radio; the format consists primarily of the alternative rock genre. Generally beginning with hardcore punk but referring especially to alternative rock music since the 1980s, the phrase &quot;modern rock&quot; is used in the US to differentiate the music from classic rock, which focuses on music recorded in the 1960s through to the early 1990s.

A few modern rock radio stations existed during the 1980s, such as KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, XETRA-FM in San Diego, WHTG-FM (now WKMK) on the Jersey Shore, WLIR on Long Island, WFNX in Boston, and KQAK The Quake in San Francisco. Modern rock was solidified as a radio format in 1988 with &quot;Billboard&quot;″s creation of the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The chart was based on weighted reports from college radio stations and commercial stations such as those listed above. The 1988 episode of the VH1 show &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot; discussed INXS, the Cure, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, and Erasure as modern rock artists representative of that year. But it was the breakthrough success of the grunge bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam in 1991 that resulted in many American radio stations switching to the format. Modern rock is considered by some to be a specific genre of alternative rock.

The format has gone through two distinct periods, dividing the line from classic modern rock and the current alternative rock format used today. Up until grunge went mainstream, the format featured a wide variety of up-tempo danceable music from a diverse group of artists that were being played in rock discos and clubs. This was a legacy from new wave music and the Second British Invasion that immediately preceded it. Of all the artists who had songs hit the top 30 in the first modern rock chart, only seven of them were American. Between 1992 and 1994, most of the female, foreign and dance music had largely disappeared from the chart. While the chart still featured a variety of alternative rock music, it was largely guitar rock created by male Americans. By 1996, the modern rock chart was largely identical to the mainstream rock chart; it was therefore surveying what was then mainstream rock music.

===2000–present===
For most of the 2000s, modern rock radio stations mostly featured songs that were crossed over from the active rock format. This was often famous for the second wave of post-grunge and nu metal scenes that derived from grunge and alternative metal music, respectively, in the 1990s. During the early 2000s, these two genres made up most of the modern rock format, despite the format being a heavily diverse format genre-wise (for example, in 2003, it was not uncommon to hear diverse artists like Jack Johnson, Muse, Coheed and Cambria, the Postal Service, the Mars Volta, Junior Senior, Snow Patrol, Story of the Year, the Black Keys, and Kings of Leon &quot;all&quot; played on the same modern rock station). By the mid-2000s, the two genres were dropped, and the revivals of genres such as post-punk, garage rock, noise rock, and dance-punk (often tagged in as the post-punk revival of that time) took its place but the post-grunge and nu metal genres still had some success.

In the 2010s, modern rock served as an indie-driven radio format featuring new, young and recent indie rock bands and artists. Ranging from genres like reggae, folk, hip hop and EDM, common indie rock artists heard on the format included Young the Giant, Of Monsters and Men, Atlas Genius, the Neighbourhood, Arcade Fire, Weezer, Twenty One Pilots, the 1975, Arctic Monkeys and Bastille. 

Near the end of the 2010s, the popularity and amount of indie rock acts began to decline. In their place, many modern rock radio stations began playing crossover pop artists including Billie Eilish, AJR, Post Malone, Glass Animals, the Kid Laroi, and Machine Gun Kelly, among others. New music from heritage acts like Foo Fighters, Blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Killers, Weezer, and the Black Keys pulled the format back towards its roots in the mid-2020s. Newer artists heard on alternative stations during this period include Måneskin, Lovelytheband, White Reaper, the Struts, and Noah Kahan.

In addition, several alternative radio stations shifted to a classic alternative playlist in the early 2020s, focusing on music primarily from the 1980s and 1990s. Stations include XETRA-FM in San Diego, WNNX in Atlanta, and WOLT in Indianapolis.

It is used to play popular rock hits from the 1970s up until the mid-2000s and has little current music in its playlists. Few radio stations will play newer rock artists; unlike active rock, it&#x27;s basically modern classic rock.

<text>Liberty Science Center is an interactive science museum and learning center located in Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States. At its opening, it was the largest such planetarium in the Western Hemisphere and the world&#x27;s fourth largest.

The center, which opened in 1993 as New Jersey&#x27;s first major state science museum, has science exhibits, numerous educational resources, and the original &quot;Hoberman sphere&quot;, a silver, computer-driven engineering artwork designed by Chuck Hoberman.

==History==

Liberty Science Center completed a 22-month, $109 million expansion and renewal project on July 19, 2007. The expansion added to the facility, bringing it to nearly .

In December 2017, the Science Center opened the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium, a 400-seat facility with a dome in diameter and an diameter screen, named for the benefactor who contributed $5 million towards the cost of construction. Larger than New York City&#x27;s Hayden Planetarium, at its opening, it was the largest such planetarium in the Western Hemisphere and the world&#x27;s fourth largest.

==Exhibits==

Liberty Science Center&#x27;s permanent exhibitions include:
* Skyscraper! Achievement and Impact – Believed to be the most comprehensive exhibit on the topic of skyscrapers, which includes large models of some of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings and explanations of various aspects of their construction, such as the physics of elevator operation, and test chamber that vets the strength of materials used to the buildings.
* Eat and Be Eaten – This exhibit of unusual live animals explores the predator-prey relationship, including vipers, puffer fish, cotton-top tamarins, brilliantly colored poison dart frogs, eusocial naked mole-rats and fungus culturing, leaf cutter ants.

* Communication is a 7,000-square-foot exhibit that explores human communication, which can be experienced by the visitor via mobile devices, multimedia, and touch, through speech, writing and symbols. The exhibit also explains how technology plays a role in modern forms of communication.
* Traveling exhibitions – Various temporary exhibits
** &quot;Mammoths and Mastodons: Titans of the Ice Age&quot; used video installations, hands-on interactive displays, life-sized models, and fossils to teach more about extinct mammals. The exhibit showcased Lyuba, the world&#x27;s best-preserved woolly mammoth specimen.
** Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition featured over 100 authentic artifacts from the &quot;Titanic&quot;, which were set within replicas of cabins and other areas of the ship. The exhibit also allowed visitors to touch an &quot;iceberg&quot; to simulate how cold the water was when the ship sank.
** Rubik&#x27;s Cube exhibition - Beyond Rubik&#x27;s Cube opened to the public on April 26, 2014, and has toured other museums around the world. The exhibition celebrates the Cube&#x27;s 40th anniversary and features artifacts and exhibits that trace the history of the Cube and mark the massive cultural influence it continues to have on popular culture today.

==Jennifer Chalsty Center for Science Learning and Teaching==
In July 2007, the Jennifer Chalsty Center for Science Learning and Teaching opened. It is a facility extending over the entire former &quot;Invention Floor&quot; of Liberty Science Center, with six laboratories, a 150-seat theater, and other resources for teachers and students. Educators can upgrade science teaching skills and find peers to help strengthen science instruction in the classroom, while students can participate in intense, multi-day or single-hour programs to ignite interest and skills in science exploration.

<doc id="975251" wikidata="Q241940" url="?curid=975251" title="Givet">
<text>Givet () (; ) is a commune in the Ardennes department in northern France surrounded on three sides by the Belgian border. 
It lies on the river Meuse where Emperor Charles V built the fortress of Charlemont. It borders the French municipalities of Fromelennes to the east and Rancennes to the south and Foisches to the southeast.

Later on, another building was added to the fort, the Caserne Rougé, the longest barracks of France at that time, named after Pierre François, Marquis de Rougé, general of the French armies k.a. 1761.

The Pointe de Givet National Nature Reserve is partly located on the commune.

== History ==
The town&#x27;s history claims that Saint Hubert lived there in 720 and performed a miracle. The town has changed hands several times since the Roman era before becoming part of France in 1678, and was later invaded by Russians and Germans.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the French maintained a camp here for British naval prisoners of war from 1804 to 1814. One of the officer prisoners, Captain Jahleel Brenton, Royal Navy, who had been captured when his ship, H.M. frigate &quot;Minerve&quot; ran aground off Cherbourg, and Naval Chaplain the Reverend Robert B. Wolfe, also a prisoner, established a school of navigation for the imprisoned British sailors. This was a successful unofficial initiative for teaching navigation that also provided a center for the growth of religious piety in the Royal Navy. An example of student work in the navigation school is
preserved in the notebook by British seaman William Carter. British seaman, John Wetherell, a survivor of the British 38-gun frigate that had wrecked near Brest and was burnt by her crew to prevent her capture, was imprisoned at Givet from 1804 to 1814 and left an account of his experiences.

In World War II, Givet was occupied by the Germans on May 12, 1940 and liberated by the allies on September 7, 1944. By December 1944, 11,000 American soldiers were billeted in the ancient Charlemont fortress. The German Ardennes Offensive targeted Givet and its crossing of the Meuse. The British, under General Montgomery, organized a last-ditch defense, and on 24 December, the German drive was stopped about from Givet.

Givet is also the birthplace of writer Henry Bidou (1873 – 1943), pianist Jeanne-Marie Darré (1905-1999) and oboist Gilles Silvestrini (born 1961).

==Population==

==Transport==
SNCF&#x27;s TER Grand Est trains run at about hourly intervals from Givet station to Charleville-Mézières, taking about an hour for the route. Compagnie des chemins de fer des Ardennes opened the station in 1862.

TEC bus 154A runs every hour or two from the station to Dinant, taking about 42 minutes. It replaces railway line 154A, which took about 30 minutes for the route and closed in 1988. In 2021 a study began into reopening a single track, with a cycleway alongside.

The former Line 138A to Florennes and Châtelet has been converted to a RAVeL cycleway.

The River Meuse is navigable from the North Sea to Givet. The Canal de la Meuse links to the rest of the French canal network. The port declined after the canal was enlarged to allow 1,350 ton barges in the 1960s, but, when it was reconnected to the railway in 2013, it was still handling about 760,000 tonnes of freight a year.

Givet is served by several main roads, including D8051 to Rocroi, formerly N51, and D949, which is the French section of Belgium&#x27;s N40, linking Arlon and Mons.

== In literature ==
Georges Simenon set his Maigret novel &quot;The Flemish House&quot; in Givet. Published first in 1932, it evokes the nature of the town at that time.

<text>Krško (; ) is a town in eastern Slovenia. It is the seat of the City Municipality of Krško. The town lies on the Sava River and on the northwest edge of the Krško Plain (), which is part of the larger Krka Flat (). The area is divided between the traditional regions of Styria (territory on the left bank of the Sava) and Lower Carniola (territory on the right bank of the Sava). The entire municipality is now included in the Lower Sava Statistical Region.

Slovenia&#x27;s only nuclear power plant, the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, lies southeast of the town.

==Name==
The name of the settlement was changed from &quot;Krško&quot; to &quot;Videm–Krško&quot; in 1953. The name &quot;Krško&quot; was restored in 1964. In the past the German name was &quot;Gurkfeld&quot;.

==History==

Archaeological evidence shows that the area was settled in prehistoric times. Along the Sava River, numerous Bronze and Iron Age sites as well as Roman finds show continuous occupation. After the Medieval period the area was a Habsburg possession. It was affected by Ottoman raids from the 15th to 17th centuries.

===Mass grave===
Krško is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Bunker Mass Grave () is located on the steep right bank of the Sava River, opposite the municipal headquarters, north of the house at Bohoričeva 4, and south of a school playground. According to statements from the Krško police, it is believed that more than 100 civilians, mostly Croatians, were murdered in an abandoned bunker and the bunker was then dynamited. The location has been precisely defined, and investigation of the site is needed.

==Main sights==
The Krško parish church in the town centre is dedicated to John the Evangelist and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Mesto. Originally a late 15th-century building, it was largely rebuilt in 1899. A second parish is the Parish of Videm-Krško in the southern part of the town. Its parish church is dedicated to Saint Rupert. It was built from 1893 to 1897 in the Neo-Romanesque style. The church in the hamlet of Stara Vas (), dedicated to Saint Michael, belongs to this parish. It was built in 1768 to replace an older structure. The church on the right bank of the Sava is dedicated to the Holy Spirit and was built in 1777 according to plans by the Austrian architect Johann Nepomuk Fuchs.

The Capuchin monastery with its church is in the centre of town on the right bank of the Sava. It was built from 1640 to 1644 and was altered at various stages in its history.

==Prominent residents==
South of Holy Spirit Church is a town house built in 1607 in which the 17th-century scholar Johann Weikhard von Valvasor lived the final years of his life. He died there in 1693. Other important figures in Slovene history linked with Krško are Adam Bohorič, a grammarian and early schoolmaster, born in Brestanica in 1520, and his pupil Jurij Dalmatin, born in Krško around 1547 who, by 1578, had translated the entire Bible into Slovene (published in 1583).

<doc id="975260" wikidata="Q1170703" url="?curid=975260" title="Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)">
<text>Mirror Ball is the 23rd studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, and features members of American rock band Pearl Jam. It was released on August 7, 1995, through Reprise Records. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.

In the same year, Pearl Jam released an accompanying EP titled &quot;Merkin Ball&quot;.

==Background==
As grunge peaked in popularity in the early 1990s, some of the bands expressed admiration for Young&#x27;s career and influence. At least one music writer noted a similarity in ethos and style between the emerging genre and Young&#x27;s work, dubbing him the &quot;Godfather of Grunge&quot;. Of the younger groups, Young had a particularly close relationship with Pearl Jam. He explains, &quot;We&#x27;re sympathetic. They&#x27;re definitely old souls—they&#x27;ve been around. Musically there&#x27;s youthful energy, but without the sound of inexperience. And our musical styles are compatible; it&#x27;s like a big wall of sound with a lot of nuances in there.&quot; Pearl Jam incorporated &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; into their setlists throughout their 1992 tour. In October, both artists performed, separately, at Bob Dylan&#x27;s The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, and Young invited the band to play an acoustic set two weeks later at that year&#x27;s Bridge School Benefit concert. Pearl Jam appeared as an opening act on Young&#x27;s 1993 tour of North America with Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. In September, Young joined the group to perform &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.

In January 1995, Young asked Eddie Vedder to induct him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Later that week, Young agreed to appear alongside Pearl Jam at a benefit supporting Voters for Choice, where he performed new songs &quot;Song X&quot; and &quot;Act of Love&quot; with his longtime collaborators Crazy Horse. At the benefit, Pearl Jam joined Young on stage for an encore performance of &quot;Act of Love&quot;, which the band had learned by recording Young&#x27;s set at the Hall of Fame ceremony. Young was inspired by the performance and became eager to record the song with the band in a studio. &quot;I said, &#x27;Maybe we ought to record it. It sounds good.&#x27; They were thinking the same thing. So we set a date to go in and record. I wanted to have more than one song, so I came in with three songs in hand.&quot; Young elaborates to Dave Marsh in a contemporary radio interview: 

==Recording==
The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place in January 1995 and February 1995 at Ann and Nancy Wilson&#x27;s Bad Animals Studio in Seattle. The album was produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, who had previously worked on Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1993 album, &quot;Vs.&quot;, and 1994 album, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.

Young joined Pearl Jam in the studio in January 1995, eleven days after performing with the band at an abortion-rights benefit in Washington, D.C. The album was recorded in four days&#x27; studio time (January 26, January 27, February 7, and February 10). Young recorded the songs live in the studio, songs he had written the day before each session. &quot;The beauty of the thing is that hardly any talking had to happen at all. I&#x27;d bring the song in and run it down, then everybody would play it. I don&#x27;t think we did more than five takes on anything. We all knew what we had to do. Everybody was together.&quot;

Young brought &quot;Song X&quot;, &quot;Act of Love&quot;, and five other songs into the studio to record for the first session in January, including &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;Big Green Country&quot; and &quot;Peace and Love&quot;. For the second session in February, he brought in two more songs. Young also wrote two new songs during the February recording sessions, and one song from the January sessions was re-recorded. On February 7, the group captured &quot;I&#x27;m the Ocean&quot; and &quot;Truth Be Known&quot; and Young recorded &quot;What Happened Yesterday&quot; solo on pump organ. &quot;Throw Your Hatred Down&quot; and &quot;Scenery&quot; would be recorded February 10. Young recorded &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; at one final solo session on February 26, again on pump organ. Young said that all of the songs, with the exception of &quot;Song X&quot; and &quot;Act of Love&quot;, were written during the album&#x27;s sessions.

Young said he traveled to Seattle to make the record for a &quot;challenge.&quot; He said, &quot;Recording &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; was like audio vérité, just a snapshot of what&#x27;s happening. Sometimes I didn&#x27;t know who was playing. I was just conscious of this big smouldering mass of sound.&quot; Playing in a group with two other lead guitarists reminded him of his days in Buffalo Springfield. Mike McCready told &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;d be jamming, and I&#x27;d look over and say to myself, &#x27;That&#x27;s Neil Young, and he&#x27;s playing leads. That&#x27;s the shit!&#x27; I could only wish to be that good. I was completely honored to be playing with him. We&#x27;re enamored of him...and I&#x27;m honored he says he&#x27;s into us. I think he just likes where we&#x27;re coming from. He sees a lot of honesty in our music.&quot; Young called Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons &quot;unbelievable.&quot; He said that Young &quot;played his ass off on every take at every session,&quot; and added, &quot;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about him.&quot; 

Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder was not around much for the recording sessions. Vedder explained that he was &quot;in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem,&quot; adding that &quot;leaving the house wasn&#x27;t the easiest thing to do.&quot; Vedder referred to the issue in the song &quot;Lukin&quot; from Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;No Code&quot;. Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard said that &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; &quot;came at a time when we needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that would be good to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He&#x27;s not taking his career so seriously that he can&#x27;t take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious.&quot;

==Writing==
&quot;Mirror Ball&quot; captures a loose rock sound. The album has a very raw sound to it, with songs ending in feedback and band members talking at the start and at the end of many songs, including Young remarking at the end of &quot;Downtown&quot;: &quot;Well, we know &quot;that&quot; one. That&#x27;s funky.&quot; Young wrote all of the tracks for the album except for &quot;Peace and Love&quot;, which was co-written by Young and Vedder. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic said that, &quot;Pearl Jam boasts spirited rhythms and dense guitar interplay that Young makes excellent use of in a series of songs built out of simple, melodic riffs.&quot;

On the lyrical content of &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, Young said, &quot;There&#x27;s idealism and reality, the two have got to come together yet there are always major problems when they do. Maybe that&#x27;s the crux of what I&#x27;m trying to say in this new album. It&#x27;s also a commentary of the differences between my peace and love &#x27;60s generation and the more cynical &#x27;90s generation.&quot; &quot;Song X&quot; and &quot;Act of Love&quot; were written about abortion. &quot;This isn&#x27;t an easy subject to confront head-on. People who say that human beings shouldn&#x27;t have the right to dismiss a human life - they have a point. You can&#x27;t dismiss that point.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m the Ocean&quot; acknowledges the difficulty of living in the moment and how easy it is for life to become a series of quick flashes of different experiences. Young explains in a 2018 post to his &quot;Archives&quot; website: &quot;Too may times in this life, we miss what is going on right in front of us...I try but sometimes i don&#x27;t see. Lots of love to the searchers...&quot; He elaborates in a contemporary radio interview: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like a bunch of flashes of things going on all at the same time or something. So you get kind of the feeling that your life is flashing before you. So that makes you think you&#x27;re floating up on the ceiling somewhere watching. I just got caught up in this thing where everything just kept happening and all I could do was write it down.&quot;

&quot;Downtown&quot; includes references to Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. The reference to Led Zeppelin was partly inspired by Young&#x27;s performance with the band at the 1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, where they played &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; together.

&quot;Peace and Love&quot; features vocals by both Young and Vedder, who also share writing credits. Young told Kurt Loder for MTV News: &quot;Ultimately what happened was that I never finished it. Eddie finished it. Because I had this melody in this place. It was a great way to save it.&quot;

&quot;Throw Your Hatred Down&quot; explores the nature of conflict and shares a message of non-violence. &quot;I was thinking about the kids in the schoolyard who are fighting - like just the different ways to go and they&#x27;re started right there. Just how...where does it start...where do we start the conflict? You know, where does it begin? It must begin at birth or something, because conflict is always there. It seems part of our nature, as sad as it sounds. I mean it must just be there...and I just, you know...was drifting around in my head trying...I just had all these images of this...conflict and people planning ways to overcome evil and evil planning ways to encroach on good.&quot;

The album closes with the extended &quot;Scenery&quot; featuring the group with Brendan O&#x27;Brien on piano and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; which reprises the melody of &quot;I&#x27;m the Ocean&quot; with Young alone on pump organ.

==Packaging==
A mirror ball graces the album&#x27;s cover. Because of legal complications between their respective record companies, only Young&#x27;s name appears on the album sleeve, although the members of Pearl Jam are credited individually in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Merkin Ball&quot; complements the layout and content of the album packaging for &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;.

==Tour==
Following the completion of &quot;Mirror Ball&quot;, the members of Pearl Jam (minus Vedder) and producer O&#x27;Brien (on keyboards) joined Young in August 1995 for an eleven-date tour in Europe to promote the album. When the band toured, fans referred to them as &quot;Neil Jam&quot;. Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready said, &quot;It was a dream come true. We got to play a bunch of Neil Young songs with Neil Young himself and got to go to Berlin, to Jerusalem, to the Red Sea.&quot; This tour proved very successful with Young&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts calling it &quot;one of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives.&quot; The performance in Dublin was professionally filmed and recorded for potential commercial release.

==Reception==
&quot;Mirror Ball&quot; reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; has been certified gold by the RIAA.

&quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; a nine out of ten. In the review, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; is called &quot;another fine Neil Young album...the record&#x27;s sound is...big, woolly, live and booming.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer J.D. Considine gave &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; four out of five stars, saying, &quot;Though Young is clearly the dominant partner—it&#x27;s his concept, after all, his songs and his album—it&#x27;s Pearl Jam who ultimately end up determining the music&#x27;s shape and feel, providing a level of input and energy that goes well beyond the normal purview of a backing band.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album eight out of ten stars. The review said, &quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to string together some power chords and a few forlorn references to religion, fame and suicide than to actually write songs. And sometimes that&#x27;s just fine.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album an A−. Browne said that &quot;the album has a spontaneous, bang-it-out casualness that is, to say the least, extremely rare for a rock veteran.&quot; However, Browne criticized the album&#x27;s lyrics, calling them &quot;mostly jumbled rehashes of standard Young imagery.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reviewer Christopher John Farley said that &quot;Pearl Jam serves as an extraordinary backup band on the new album.&quot; Farley added that the album is &quot;one of the most consistently rewarding works of Young&#x27;s long rewarding career.&quot;

Allmusic staff writer William Ruhlmann gave the album three out of five stars, saying that &quot;&quot;Mirror Ball&quot; is typically uneven.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau said that Young &quot;was born to lumber, and Pearl Jam wasn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album two out of five stars. The review said that &quot;it could have been better. The fault is less with Pearl Jam, who thrash so awkwardly they make Crazy Horse sound like Steely Dan, than with Young’s unmemorable songs.&quot;

&quot;Downtown&quot; and &quot;Peace and Love&quot; had accompanying music videos. &quot;Downtown&quot; was the most successful song from &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; on the rock charts, reaching number six on the Mainstream Rock charts. &quot;Peace and Love&quot; also charted on the Mainstream Rock charts. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, &quot;Downtown&quot; received a nomination for Best Rock Song and &quot;Peace and Love&quot; received a nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; received a nomination for Best Rock Album. Album cover artist Gary Burden was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

==Track listing==
==Outtakes==
The songs &quot;I Got Id&quot; and &quot;Long Road&quot;, both written and sung by Vedder, were cut from the album. Both songs were recorded at the tail end of the &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; sessions. The tracks were later released on Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Merkin Ball&quot; EP.

<text>Helen Elizabeth &quot;Tess&quot; Daly (born 29 March 1969) is an English television presenter and former model. Since 2004, she has co-presented the BBC One dancing competition show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.

== Early life ==
Helen Elizabeth Daly was born on 29 March 1969 in Stockport, Cheshire to textile-factory workers Felix James &quot;Vivian&quot; Daly (1932–2003), who died of emphysema, and Sylvia ( Bradley). She grew up in Birch Vale near New Mills, Derbyshire and attended Hayfield Primary School followed by New Mills Secondary School, where she gained nine O-levels. She has a younger sister, Karen. Daly is of English and Irish descent.

== Career ==
=== Modelling ===
Daly was scouted outside a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant while waiting for her sister in Manchester. When Daly began her modelling career there was already a model named &quot;Helen Daly&quot; so she was asked to reconsider her name. Daly&#x27;s agent was infatuated with Nastassja Kinski from the film &quot;Tess&quot; and told her that she should change her name to &quot;Tess&quot;. Daly later recalled that she was &quot;gullible and impressionable&quot;. She has not officially changed her name by deed poll because she thinks it would be disrespectful to her parents.

Six weeks after she turned 18 she undertook her first professional modelling job in Tokyo. After a series of work assignments across Asia and Europe while based in London, she was based in Paris for five years. She then returned to London for six months, before moving to New York for five years.

In 1990, Daly appeared in two Duran Duran videos for the songs &quot;Serious&quot; and &quot;Violence of Summer (Love&#x27;s Taking Over)&quot;, both from the album &quot;Liberty&quot;. She also appeared nude in the video for The Beloved&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot;.

She was later the face of Danone Shape yogurt and also of lingerie company La Senza in the UK and appeared in their Steal the Show Christmas 2009 campaign.

=== Television ===

While Daly was living on the Lower East Side in New York City, a friend who arranged red carpet events suggested that she interview the celebrity attendees. After buying a video camera, Daly&#x27;s first interview was with New York-based Quentin Crisp, author of &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;, who became a friend until his death. After a few red carpet interviews, in 2000, she sent a showreel to the producers of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, who immediately contracted her to host the &quot;Find Me a Model&quot; competition. Since then, she has presented shows including &quot;Get Your Kit Off&quot;, &quot;Singled Out&quot;, &quot;Smash Hits TV&quot;, &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;Back To Reality&quot; and the first series of &quot;Make Me a Supermodel&quot; with Dave Berry.

In 2003, Daly replaced Ulrika Jonsson as presenter of ITV makeover show &quot;Home On Their Own&quot;, a show where children made their choice of alterations to their house during the course of a weekend, while their parents went on holiday. Some of the home improvements included an Austin Powers room, individual doorbells for the children and a cinema living room.

Daly has co-presented BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; since 2004. She initially co-hosted the programme with Bruce Forsyth until he left the show in 2013; since 2014 she co-hosts with Claudia Winkleman. Daly missed the first half of the second series because she had recently given birth to her first daughter. Natasha Kaplinsky, the winner of the previous series, took her place for these episodes.

In January 2007, Daly and her husband Vernon Kay co-presented the second series of &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; on BBC One.

Daly has also hosted &quot;This Time Tomorrow&quot; and the National Lottery show broadcast on BBC One. From 2008 to 2019, Daly co-presented the BBC telethon &quot;Children in Need&quot; alongside Terry Wogan and Fearne Cotton. She also won the special &quot;Children in Need&quot; version of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; against Terry Wogan, where she was partnered with Anton du Beke. On 17 December 2008, Daly co-hosted the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;.

In November 2013, Daly guest-presented an episode of &quot;The One Show&quot; alongside Matt Baker. In early 2015, she co-hosted &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; charity spin-off &quot;The People&#x27;s Strictly for Comic Relief&quot; for BBC One. In 2015, Daly co-hosted &quot;Being Mum&quot;, a new show for AOL alongside Rochelle Humes.

In 2019, she played an unnamed character who hosts fictional TV show &quot;The Spotlight&quot;, in the CBBC drama, &quot;Almost Never&quot;.

=== Other work ===
In 2011, Daly&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Camera Never Lies&quot;, a tale of love behind the scenes, was published by Coronet, an imprint of Hodder &amp; Stoughton. &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You New York&quot;, Daly&#x27;s second book, was published in 2013.

In 2013, she became the new face of L&#x27;Oréal. In December 2017, Daly became the new face of Vitabiotics&#x27; Wellwoman supplement brand. She is the co-founder, with former swimwear model Gayle Lawton, of the swimwear brand Naia Beach.

== Personal life ==
Daly married DJ and television presenter Vernon Kay on 12 September 2003 at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Horwich, near Bolton. They have two daughters, born in 2004 and 2008, and live in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.

Velenje was first attested in written sources in 1264 as &quot;Weln&quot; (and as &quot;Welan&quot; in 1270, and &quot;Belen&quot; and &quot;Welen&quot; in 1296). The name derives from *&quot;Velen′e selo&quot; &#x27;Velenъ&#x27;s village&#x27;. A less likely hypothesis derives the name from the Slovene common noun &quot;velen(je)&quot; &#x27;pasture for livestock&#x27;. The name of the town was changed to &quot;Titovo Velenje&quot; (literally, &#x27;Tito&#x27;s Velenje&#x27;) in 1981 in honor of the Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The name &quot;Velenje&quot; was restored in 1990, just before the declaration of Slovenian independence in 1991. In the past, the German name of the settlement was Wöllan.

==History==

===Mass grave===
The Koželj Mass Grave () from the period immediately after World War II, is located in the Goll Woods () below Big Koželj Hill () beside a tributary of Trubušnica Creek. It contains the remains of a truckload of Slovene civilian prisoners, including many Velenje natives, that were transported from the prisons in Celje and shot on June 15, 1945. The site is marked by an official inventory sign and a small concrete plaque.

===Modern history===

The 1889 Old Velenje (), the old part of today&#x27;s city, was a small market town with 364 citizens, located downtown at the foot of Velenje Castle. The lignite mining industry in the area contributed to the expansion of the town before World War II.

After the war, Velenje rapidly advanced and developed into a modern city. The city was planned and built in the 1950s, in the time of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. The manufacturer of home appliances, Gorenje, moved its headquarters to the city from the nearby settlement of Gorenje.

The central Tito Square officially opened on September 20, 1959, and features the tallest statue of Tito in the world (about ). It was designed by Antun Augustinčič and Vladimir Herljević. The square was once used as a meeting place of Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, as well as Edward Gierek and Nicolae Ceaușescu.

==Geography==

Velenje is located in northeast Slovenia, some 85 km from the capital Ljubljana, and the country&#x27;s second- and third-largest cities Maribor and Celje, are 75 km and 25 km away, respectively, with Graz (Austria) around 130 km away. Velenje is well connected by train and bus to other destinations, and is also easy to reach by car.

===Climate===
==Culture==
The Velenje Cultural Center, in the northwestern part of the square, was built in 1959 according to plans by Oton Gaspari, and opened in November 1960. Its façade was decorated with a relief by Stojan Batič, and its interior by Riko Debenjak. The hall was the 1990s center of subcultures in Velenje. Today, it hosts the public institute Velenje Festival, which holds various cultural activities. The hall also houses a puppet theatre and a dance theatre.

==Economy and education==
Velenje is one of the strongest economic centers in Slovenia, equipped with modern infrastructure. Economic development is based on the energy, metal-processing, and construction industries. The only operating lignite mine in Slovenia is located immediately west of the city. Environmental protection, craft, and trade services have been experiencing solid development. The city has three large shopping centers. These include Hypermarket Mercator Velenje, Velenjka, and Velenje Shopping Center.

Velenje is an employment, administrative, and educational center of the wider Savinja–Šalek region. It has six primary schools, seven secondary/high schools, a university, and a music school.

==Transportation==

The drive from Ljubljana takes about one hour. Velenje&#x27;s city center is relatively easily covered on foot, or by bicycle. Bicycles can be rented from the tourist office in Villa Bianca.

There are up to 15 trains per day to Ljubljana and Maribor during the week, all of which require a transfer in Celje and take about 2 to 3 hours. Fares cost between €8 and €13 one-way. There are only four trains on Saturdays, and none on Sundays. Velenje&#x27;s train station is located just west of the city centre.

Velenje&#x27;s bus station is on Šalek Street (), just east of the Mercator shopping center. There are frequent local and regional buses during the week, with up to five direct buses on weekdays to Ljubljana and up to 22 to Celje. Public city bus transport in Velenje is cost-free.

The nearest airport is Ljubljana Airport, with Graz, Klagenfurt, and Zagreb airports relatively nearby.

==Sports==
Velenje holds the only long adventure race in Slovenia, called Adventure Race Slovenia, which is known across Europe and is held every weekend in June. It was first held in 2003 by the Lake Dragon Scout Group.

The handball club RK Gorenje Velenje and football club NK Rudar Velenje are based in Velenje. The city is the birthplace of Jolanda Čeplak, a Slovenian middle distance athlete and Olympic bronze medalist. It is also the hometown of the Slovenian tennis player Katarina Srebotnik.

==Religion==
The parish church in Velenje dates to the 13th century with 16th- and 17th-century additions. It is dedicated to Saint Martin, and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. A significant portion of Velenje&#x27;s populace today describe themselves as atheists.

<text>Henri Pequet (1 February 1888 – 13 March 1974) was a pilot in the first official airmail flight on February 18, 1911. The 23-year-old Frenchman, in India for an airshow, delivered about 6,500 letters when he flew from an Allahabad polo field to Naini, about 10 kilometers away. He flew a Humber-Sommer biplane with about fifty horsepower (37 kW), and made the journey in thirteen minutes.

The letters were marked &quot;First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition Allahabad 1911.&quot;

<text>Carbidopa (Lodosyn) is a drug given to people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in order to inhibit peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This property is significant in that it allows a greater proportion of administered levodopa to cross the blood–brain barrier for central nervous system effect, instead of being peripherally metabolised into substances unable to cross said barrier.

== Pharmacology ==
Carbidopa inhibits aromatic -amino-acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase or DDC), an enzyme important in the biosynthesis of serotonin from and in the biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) from . DDC exists both outside of (body periphery) and within the confines of the blood–brain barrier.

Carbidopa is used in the treatment of, among other diseases, Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), a condition characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Increased dopamine availability may increase the effectiveness of the remaining neurons and alleviate symptoms for a time. The pharmacologic objective is to get an exogenous dopamine-precursor known as levodopa/ into the dopamine-deficient brains of PD patients. Levodopa/ can cross the blood–brain barrier, but dopamine cannot. The use of carbidopa seems counter-intuitive in Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD) in that it prevents DDC conversion of levodopa/ to dopamine. However, exogenously provided, levadopa/ gets metabolized peripherally to its active metabolite dopamine before reaching the blood–brain barrier. Therefore, the PD brain, which is deficient in dopamine, will not receive as much of its prodrug precursor levodopa/ due to peripheral DDC breakdown. However, carbidopa can decrease peripheral DDC conversion of levodopa/ before it crosses the blood–brain barrier. Carbidopa acts as a peripheral DDC inhibitor, as carbidopa, itself, cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. In other words, carbidopa has no effect on brain DDC conversion of levodopa/ to dopamine. Ultimately, a greater proportion of the exogenously provided levodopa/ reaches the brain. Commercially, carbidopa/levodopa combinations are available in the treatment of central dopamine deficiencies.

Along with carbidopa, other DDC inhibitors are benserazide (Ro-4-4602), difluoromethyldopa, and α-methyldopa.

== Pharmacology 2 ==

Carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as &quot;N&quot;-amino-α-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C10H14N2O4•H2O. Used in tandem with (also known as levodopa, a dopamine precursor converted in the body to dopamine), it increases the plasma half-life of levodopa from 50 minutes to 1½ hours. Carbidopa cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, so it inhibits only peripheral DDC. It thus prevents the conversion of to dopamine peripherally. This reduces the side effects caused by dopamine on the periphery, as well as increasing the concentration of L-DOPA and dopamine in the brain.

The combination of carbidopa/levodopa carries the brand names of Kinson, Sinemet, Pharmacopa and Atamet; while Stalevo is a combination with entacapone, which enhances the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa.

Carbidopa is most commonly used as a method to inhibit the activity of DOPA decarboxylase. This is an enzyme that breaks down in the periphery and converts it to dopamine. This results in the newly formed dopamine being unable to cross the blood–brain barrier and the effectiveness of treatments is greatly decreased. Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid. Elimination half-life of levodopa in the presence of carbidopa is about 1.5 hours. Following SINEMET CR, the apparent half-life of levodopa may be prolonged because of continuous absorption. This is extremely useful in the treatment of Parkinsons disease symptoms because the amount of levodopa administered to the patient can be greatly reduced. This reduction in dosage is extremely useful due to the side effects that may occur from an overdose of within the body.

Carbidopa is also used in combination with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a naturally occurring amino acid which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin and an intermediate in tryptophan metabolism. Carbidopa, which is used in PD to prevent conversion of the levodopa to dopamine, prevents the metabolism of 5-HTP in the liver and causes decreased levels of serotonin
in the blood. Research shows that co-administration of 5-HTP and carbidopa greatly increases plasma 5-HTP levels. Several cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP. In Europe, 5-HTP is prescribed with carbidopa to prevent the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin until it reaches the brain.

== Synthesis ==

The synthesis begins with a modified Strecker reaction using hydrazine and potassium cyanide on (1) to give 2. This is then hydrolyzed with cold HCl to give carboxamide 3. More vigorous hydrolysis with 48% HBr cleaves the amide bond and the aryl ether group to produce carbidopa (4).

<text>The Richmond Times-Dispatch (RTD or TD for short) is the primary daily newspaper in Richmond, Virginia, and the primary newspaper of record for the state of Virginia.

==Circulation==
The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; has the second-highest circulation of any Virginia newspaper, after Norfolk&#x27;s &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot;. In addition to the Richmond area (Petersburg, Chester, Hopewell, Colonial Heights and surrounding areas), the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; has substantial readership in Charlottesville, Lynchburg, and Waynesboro. As the primary paper of the state&#x27;s capital, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; serves as a newspaper of record for rural regions of the state that lack large local papers. The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; lists itself as &quot;Virginia&#x27;s News Leader&quot; on its masthead.

==History and notable accomplishments==
===Development===
Although the &quot;Richmond Compiler&quot; was published in Virginia&#x27;s capital beginning in 1815, and merged with a later newspaper called &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Times and Compiler&quot; failed in 1853, despite an attempt of former banker James A. Cowardin and William H. Davis to revive it several years before. In 1850, Cowardin and Davis established a rival newspaper called the &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot;, and by 1852 the &quot;Dispatch&quot; bragged of having circulation three times as large as any other daily paper in the city, and advertising dominated even its front page. Cowardin began his only term in the Virginia House of Delegates (as a Whig) in 1853, but many thought the city&#x27;s pre-eminent paper the &quot;Richmond Examiner&quot;. John Hammersley bought half of the newspaper company in 1859, and continued as a joint publisher on the masthead until May 5, 1862, when no name appeared. By April 1861, the newspaper announced its circulation was &quot;within a fraction of 13,000.&quot; The newspaper had been staunchly pro-slavery since 1852, and called Union soldiers &quot;thieves and cut-throats&quot;. Most of its wartime issues are now available online. In 1864, Hammersley brought new presses from England, having run the Union blockade, although he sold half his interest to James W. Lewellen before his dangerous departure (presumably through Wilmington, North Carolina, the last Southern port open to Confederate vessels in 1864).

The &quot;Richmond Daily Dispatch&quot; published its last wartime issue on April 1, 1865; and its office was destroyed the next night during the fire set by Confederate soldiers as they left the city. However, it resumed publication on December 9, 1865, establishing a new office at 12th and Main Streets and accepting Henry K. Ellyson as part-owner as well as editor. By 1866, the &quot;Dispatch&quot; was one of five papers &quot;carrying prestige from &quot;ante bellum&quot; days&quot; published in Richmond (of seven newspapers). Although the newspaper initially opposed the Ku Klux Klan, the &quot;Richmond Dispatch&quot; accepted Klan advertising in 1868, as it fought Congressional Reconstruction and the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868. However, it later accepted the resulting state constitution (after anti-Confederate provisions were stripped) as well as allowing Negroes on juries and in the legislature. Ellyson briefly served as Richmond&#x27;s mayor in 1870, selected by Richmond&#x27;s city council appointed by Governor Gilbert C. Walker. After what some called the &quot;Municipal War&quot; because the prior appointed mayor George Chahoon refused to relinquish his office and mob violence and blockades, the Virginia Supreme Court declared Ellyson the mayor but awaited elections. After skullduggery concerning stolen ballots in the pro-Chahoon Jackson Ward and the election commission declared Ellyson the winner, he refused to serve under the resulting cloud, leading to yet another problematic election won by the Conservative Party candidate. The revived &quot;Dispatch&quot; later opposed former Confederate General William Mahone and his Readjuster Party. After James Cowardin died in 1882, his son Charles took the helm (with Ellyson&#x27;s assistance, and with Ellyson family members handling business operations), and the paper stopped supporting Negro rights, instead criticizing Del. John Mercer Langston with racial stereotypes.

In 1886, Lewis Ginter founded the &quot;Richmond Daily Times&quot;. A year later, lawyer Joseph Bryan (1845-1908) bought the &quot;Daily Times&quot; from Ginter, beginning the paper&#x27;s long association with the Bryan family. Bryan and Ginter had previously helped revitalize the Tanner &amp; Delany Engine Company, transforming it into the Richmond Locomotive Works, which had 800 employees by 1893 and built 200 locomotives per year. In 1890, the &quot;Daily Times&quot; changed its name to the &quot;Richmond Times&quot;. In 1896, Bryan acquired the eight-year-old rival &quot;Manchester Leader&quot; and launched the &quot;Evening Leader&quot;. In 1899, the evening &quot;Richmond News&quot; was founded. John L. Williams, owner of the &quot;Dispatch&quot;, bought the &quot;News&quot; in 1900.

By 1903, it was obvious Richmond was not big enough to support four papers. That year, Williams and Bryan agreed to merge Richmond&#x27;s main newspapers. The morning papers merged to become the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; under Bryan&#x27;s ownership, while the evening papers merged to become &quot;The Richmond News Leader&quot; under Williams&#x27; ownership. Bryan bought the &quot;News Leader&quot; in 1908, but died later that year. (Joseph Bryan Park was donated by his widow, Isobel (&quot;Belle&quot;) Stewart Bryan, and named for him).

His son John Stewart Bryan had given up his own legal career in 1900 to become a reporter working for the &quot;Dispatch&quot; and helped found the Associated Press and then became vice-president of the publishing company. Upon his father&#x27;s death, John Stewart Bryan became owner and publisher of the two papers, but in 1914 sold a controlling interest in the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; to three families. He hired Douglas Southall Freeman as editor of the &quot;News Leader&quot; in 1915, and remained in control until becoming President of the College of William and Mary in 1934 (and publishing a biography of his father the following year). John Stewart Bryan reacquired the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; in 1940 when the two papers&#x27; business interests merged to form Richmond Newspapers, in which Bryan held a 54-percent interest. That conglomeration is now known as Media General. Other publishers in the Bryan family include D. Tennant Bryan and John Stewart Bryan III.

In 1948, Virginius Dabney won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing while editorializing for the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot;.

On June 1, 1992, four days after its sponsored contestant Amanda Goad won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, the &quot;News Leader&quot;, which had been losing circulation for many years, ceased publication and was folded into the &quot;Times-Dispatch.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; columnist Michael Paul Williams was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his writing about the protest movements in Richmond in the wake of the murder of George Floyd leading to the removal of many Confederate monuments. Williams joined the paper in 1982 and has been a columnist since 1992.

===2004 Mosul attack===
The &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; drew national attention for its coverage of a December 21, 2004, attack by a suicide bomber on an American military base in Mosul, Iraq. The deadliest attack on an American military installation since the war began, the attack injured 69 people and killed 22, including two with the Virginia National Guard&#x27;s Richmond-based 276th Engineer Battalion. Stories and photographs about the attack by a &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; reporter embedded with the 276th were read, heard and seen across the nation.

===Tacky Christmas lights tour===
In 1990, The &quot;RTD&quot; borrowed an idea from a local entrepreneur, Barry &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Gottlieb, to encourage a &quot;Tacky Christmas Lights Tour,&quot; also known by locals as the &quot;Tacky Light Tour&quot;. Every week, the &quot;RTD&quot; lists the addresses of houses where the most tacky Christmas lights can be found. In 2004, Matt Burgess created a website devoted to Richmond&#x27;s Tacky Light Tour, which led to it being featured on the Crazy Christmas Lights show on The Learning Channel (TLC). The international exposure from the recurring TLC broadcast led to this tradition becoming popular in other cities, like Fairfax, Virginia (DC area) as well as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Birmingham, Alabama.

=== Media General sale to Berkshire Hathaway ===
On May 17, 2012, Media General announced the sale of its newspaper division to BH Media, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway company. The sale included all of Media General&#x27;s newspapers except &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; and its associated publications. Berkshire Hathaway bought 63 newspapers for $142 million and, as part of the deal, offered Media General a $400 million term loan at 10.5 percent interest that would mature in 2020 and a $45 million revolving line of credit. Berkshire Hathaway received a seat on Media General&#x27;s board of directors and an option to purchase a 19.9% stake in the company. The deal closed on June 25, 2012.

=== Lee Enterprises acquisition ===
Lee Enterprises acquired the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; and eight other Virginia newspapers they already manage for Berkshire Hathaway in March 2020 as part of a larger $140 million deal that included 111 publications across 10 states. In July 2022, Kelly Till became the first female publisher of the paper. In September 2024, the newspaper laid off two sports writers.

==Political associations==
Diane Cantor, the wife of former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, sat on Media General&#x27;s Board of Directors from 2005 to 2017. This drew some conflict-of-interest allegations because the &quot;RTD&quot; served much of the then-congressman&#x27;s 7th district, but no evidence surfaced that she was involved in the paper&#x27;s content. Her association with the paper was noted at the end of &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; stories about Rep. Cantor.

==Content==

===Commentary, opinion, and editorials===
A prominent newspaper in the state, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; frequently features commentary from important figures from around Virginia, such as officials and presidents from Virginia Commonwealth University, the College of William and Mary, and the University of Virginia. Former Richmond Mayor Douglas Wilder, who had articles published in the paper before he held that position, often outlined policies his administration was implementing. During the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, its Commentary sections featured some pieces by Retired Admiral Roy Hoffmann, a founding member of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and resident of Richmond suburb Chesterfield, against Democratic candidate John Kerry.

Editorially, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; has historically leaned conservative. It supported many of former President George W. Bush&#x27;s policies, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and a flat income tax. However, the paper is not unilaterally conservative; for example, a 2005 editorial called for the then House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to relinquish his leadership position on ethical grounds. There are also some liberal syndicated columnists who appear frequently, especially Leonard Pitts.

During the Civil Rights Movement, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot;, like nearly every major newspaper in Virginia, was an ardent supporter of segregation.

In the 2016 presidential election, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson over major party candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Clinton&#x27;s running mate, Tim Kaine, is a Richmond resident who served as mayor of the city from 1998 to 2001. From at least 1980 until its Johnson endorsement in 2016, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; had only endorsed Republican presidential candidates.

===Sports===
Like most major papers, the sports section has MLB, NASCAR, MLS, NBA, NCAA, NFL, and NHL scores and results. The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; sports pages naturally focus on Richmond and Virginia professional and college teams, especially VCU, Richmond, Virginia, and Virginia Tech. In addition, the paper covers the Richmond Flying Squirrels and Richmond Kickers, as well as Washington-based teams such as the Washington Commanders and Washington Nationals. &quot;Virginians in the Pros&quot; and similar features track all sorts of professional athletes who were born, lived in, or attended college in Virginia. Large automobile racing events like the Sprint Cup (at the Richmond International Raceway) are often given a separate preview guide.

Catering to the vast array of Virginia hunters, fishers, hikers, and outdoorsmen, somewhere between half a page to a whole page most days is dedicated to outdoors articles. The &quot;Scoreboard,&quot; which features minor-league standings, sports-betting, and other sports scores, also gives tide measurements, river levels, and skiing conditions, depending on the season.

Virginians have traditionally been highly supportive of high school athletics, and its flagship paper is a testament to that. Particular emphasis is given to American football and basketball; The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; ranks area teams in these sports, in the style of the NCAA polls, and generally updates them weekly. In the fall, Sunday editions have the scores of all high school football games played that weekend from across the state. Prep games are also receive above-average coverage in baseball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Stories are frequently done on notable prep athletes, such as those from foreign countries, those with disabilities, those who play a multitude of sports, or those who had little or no prior experience in a sport which they now excel in.

===Business===
The business desk consists only of six reporters; they cover technology, retail, energy, insurance, banking, economics, real estate, manufacturing, transportation and consumer issues. Unlike many newspapers, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; produces a widely read Monday business section, Metro Business. It contains a center cover story on a regional business-related issue and is filled with events for the coming week, advice columnists and gadget reviews. In June 2006, the decision was made to remove the stock tables from the daily sections beginning July 15 and replace the numerous pages with a &quot;Markets Review&quot; section for subscribers who request it. The stock section was eliminated in 2009, as was the Sunday Real Estate section (both were cost-cutting moves). The Sunday Business section, which had been a showcase of general business-interest stories and features, has been rechristened Moneywise and now features primarily consumer-related coverage. Moneywise is also among select Sunday business sections nationwide that print &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; Sunday pages.

===Photography===
In August 2019, the &quot;RTD&quot; publicized on its pages a large book of photos and text relating to the history of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; newspaper, offering a substantial discount to online readers. Staff photographer Bob Brown was asked to write about his long association with the newspaper, and his resulting article was &quot;The Summer of &#x27;69&quot;.

==Controversy==
On July 12, 2006, Richmond-based news magazine &quot;Style Weekly&quot; ran a cover story titled &quot;Truth and Consequences,&quot; a piece that took a look at the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; operations as the paper settled into its first year with new management. The report described new editor Glenn Proctor, who took over Nov. 14, 2005, as an &quot;inelegant, blunt and harsh critic — to the point of saying, repeatedly, that some reporters&#x27; work &#x27;sucks.&#x27;&quot; The piece described a newsroom teetering on the edge, preparing for promised changes — such as possible layoffs, fewer pages and combined sections — that eventually were realized. On April 2, 2009, the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; cut 90 jobs, laying off 59 workers, including 28 newsroom jobs. Proctor left the paper in 2011.

The front page of the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; August 14, 2011 Sunday paper consisted entirely of a Wells Fargo advertisement, commemorating said bank&#x27;s acquisition of Wachovia properties in Virginia.

<doc id="975300" wikidata="Q2755244" url="?curid=975300" title="Eccentricity vector">
<text>In celestial mechanics, the eccentricity vector of a Kepler orbit is the dimensionless vector with direction pointing from apoapsis to periapsis and with magnitude equal to the orbit&#x27;s scalar eccentricity. For Kepler orbits the eccentricity vector is a constant of motion. Its main use is in the analysis of almost circular orbits, as perturbing (non-Keplerian) forces on an actual orbit will cause the osculating eccentricity vector to change continuously as opposed to the eccentricity and argument of periapsis parameters for which eccentricity zero (circular orbit) corresponds to a singularity.

==Calculation==
The eccentricity vector formula_1 is: 

:formula_2

which follows immediately from the vector identity:
:formula_3
where:
*formula_4 is position vector
*formula_5 is velocity vector
*formula_6 is specific angular momentum vector (equal to formula_7)

*formula_8 is standard gravitational parameter

<doc id="975303" wikidata="Q5986479" url="?curid=975303" title="Icing (nautical)">
<text>Icing on ships is a serious hazard where cold temperatures (below about ) combined with high wind speed (typically force 8 or above on the Beaufort scale) result in spray blown off the sea freezing immediately on contact with the ship. If not frequently knocked off, the ice can soon build up on the ship&#x27;s superstructure to a sufficient weight to capsize the ship.

It is typically a problem in Arctic and Antarctic seas, but can also occur in other seas such as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the Sea of Japan, the Baltic Sea, and, very rarely, the North Sea.

<doc id="975309" wikidata="Q2823339" url="?curid=975309" title="Cementation process">
<text>The cementation process is an obsolete technology for making steel by carburization of iron. Unlike modern steelmaking, it increased the amount of carbon in the iron. It was apparently developed before the 17th century. Derwentcote Steel Furnace, built in 1720, is the earliest surviving example of a cementation furnace. Another example in the UK is the cementation furnace in Doncaster Street, Sheffield.

==Origins==
The process was described in a treatise published in Prague in 1574. It was invented by Johann Nussbaum of Magdeburg, who began operations at Nuremberg (with partners) in 1601. The process was patented in England by William Ellyot and Mathias Meysey in 1614. At that date, the &quot;invention&quot; could consist merely of the introduction of a new industry or product, or even a mere monopoly. They evidently soon transferred the patent to Sir Basil Brooke, but he was forced to surrender it in 1619. A clause in the patent prohibiting the import of steel was found to be undesirable because he could not supply as much good steel as was needed. Brooke&#x27;s furnaces were probably in his manor of Madeley at Coalbrookdale (which certainly existed before the English Civil War) where two cementation furnaces have been excavated. He probably used bar iron from the Forest of Dean, where he was a partner in farming the King&#x27;s ironworks in two periods. 

By 1631, it was recognised that Swedish iron was the best raw material and then or later particularly certain marks (brands) such as &quot;double bullet&quot; (so called from the mark OO) from Österby and &quot;hoop L&quot; from Leufsta (now Lövsta), whose mark consisted of an L in a circle, both belonging to Louis De Geer and his descendants. These were among the first ironworks in Sweden to use the Walloon process of fining iron, producing what was known in England as oregrounds iron. It was so called from the Swedish port of Öregrund, north of Stockholm, in whose hinterland most of the ironworks lay. The ore used came ultimately from the Dannemora mine.

==Process==

The process begins with wrought iron and charcoal. It uses one or more long stone &quot;pots&quot; inside a furnace. Typically, in Sheffield, each pot was 14 feet by 4 feet and 3.5 feet deep. Iron bars and charcoal are packed in alternating layers, with a top layer of charcoal and then refractory matter to make the pot or &quot;coffin&quot; airtight. Some manufacturers used a mixture of powdered charcoal, soot and mineral salts, called &quot;cement powder&quot;. In larger works, up to 16 tons of iron were treated in each cycle, though it can be done on a small scale, such as in a small furnace or blacksmith&#x27;s forge.

Depending on the thickness of the iron bars, the pots were then heated from below for a week or more. Bars were regularly examined and when the correct condition was reached the heat was withdrawn and the pots were left until cool—usually around fourteen days. The iron had gained a little over 1% in mass from the carbon in the charcoal, and had become heterogeneous bars of &quot;blister steel&quot;.

The bars were then shortened, bound, heated and forge welded together to become &quot;shear steel&quot;. It would be cut and re welded multiple times, with each new weld producing a more homogeneous, higher quality steel. This would be done at most 3-4 times, as more is unnecessary and could potentially cause carbon loss from the steel. 

Alternatively they could be broken up and melted in a crucible using a crucible furnace with a flux to become &quot;crucible steel&quot; (at the time also called &quot;cast steel&quot;), a process devised by Benjamin Huntsman in Sheffield in the 1740s.

===Brass production===
In the early modern period, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, was usually produced by a cementation process in which metallic copper was heated with calamine, a zinc ore, to make calamine brass.

<text>Dante Bruno Fascell (March 9, 1917 – November 28, 1998) was an American politician who represented Florida as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1955 to 1993. He served as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for nine years.

==Early life and education==
Dante Fascell was born in Bridgehampton, New York. In 1925, his family moved to Florida. In 1938, he graduated from the University of Miami School of Law. Fascell was a brother of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity and the Kappa Sigma fraternity. While a University of Miami law school student, Fascell was inducted into its Iron Arrow Honor Society, the University of Miami&#x27;s highest honor. 
Fascell joined the Florida National Guard in 1941 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1942, serving in the African, Sicilian, and Italian Campaigns during World War II, eventually rising to the rank of captain.

==Political career==
Fascell was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1950. In 1954 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat in a district representing Dade County, Florida.

Fascell was the sole Democratic representative from the state of Florida (1 of 7) to not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto. Fascell would later go on to vote in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1968, in addition to the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but not the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 (though he agreed to the Anderson-Aiken amendment) or 1964.

Fascell began as a supporter of the Vietnam War, but he soon spoke out against the war. Fascell cosponsored the War Powers Act of 1973 and he won aid for Cuban-Americans who had settled in his district. He served as the chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1984 to 1993. He worked to repeal the Clark Amendment, allowing the U.S. government to send aid to UNITA rebels in Angola, as a partner in the Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly lobbying firm.

Fascell worked to champion the creation of Biscayne National Park, south of Miami. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. The visitor center in the park is named after Representative Fascell. Similarly, a public park located in South Miami is named for him. The Dante B. Fascell North-South Center Act of 1991 established the prestigious think tank at the University of Miami.

Fascell retired from the House after his 19th term ended in 1993. When President Bill Clinton took office he proposed to nominate Fascell as the United States Ambassador to Italy, however Fascell declined for family reasons as he had developed colorectal cancer. On October 29, 1998, Fascell was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Clinton. He died the following month from colorectal cancer, at the age of 81.

<text>Hilma Natalia Granqvist (17 July 1890 Sipoo – 25 February 1972 Helsinki) was a Swedish-speaking Finnish anthropologist who conducted long field studies of Palestinians. She was a student of Edvard Westermarck.

==Studies==
In the 1920s Granqvist arrived at the village of Artas, just outside Bethlehem in the then British Mandate of Palestine as part of her research on the women of the Old Testament. She had gone to Palestine &quot;in order to find the Jewish ancestors of Scripture&quot;. What she found instead was a Palestinian people with a distinct culture and way of life. She therefore changed the focus of her research to a full investigation of the customs, habits and ways of thinking of the people of that village. Granqvist ended up staying until 1931 documenting all aspects of village life. In so doing she took hundreds of photographs.&quot;

== Example of wedding song, recorded by Granqvist ==

&quot;God knows that our outfit today&lt;br&gt;
A hundred ‘royal’ robes which we have cut&lt;br&gt;
For the bride to whom we are betrothed.&lt;br&gt;
God knows – today is our outfit&lt;br&gt;
A green and a ‘royal’ [malak] dress we have bought&lt;br&gt;
For the bride to whom we are betrothed!&lt;br&gt;
Ten jackets [taqsireh] have we bought&lt;br&gt;
For the beloved ones in order to appease her&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(Granqvist: &quot;Marriage conditions in a Palestinian village&quot;, vol. 2 (1931), p. 42.)
