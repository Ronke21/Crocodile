<text>Eugene Howard Spafford (born 1956), known as Spaf, is an American professor of computer science at Purdue University and a computer security expert.

Spafford serves as an advisor to U.S. government agencies and corporations. In 1998, he founded and was the first director of the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS) at Purdue University.

==Biography==
===Education and early career===
Spafford attended the State University of New York at Brockport, graduating with a double major in mathematics and computer science in three years. He then attended the School of Information and Computer Sciences (now the College of Computing) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received his Master of Science (M.S.) in 1981, and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in 1986, for his design and implementation of the kernel of the original &quot;Clouds&quot; distributed operating system.

During the formative years of the Internet, Spafford made significant contributions to establishing semi-formal processes to organize and manage Usenet, then the primary channel of communication between users, and to defining the standards of behavior governing its use. Spafford initiated the Phage List as a response to the Morris Worm, one of the earliest computer worms.

===Computer science at Purdue===
Spafford has served on the faculty at Purdue University in Indiana since 1987, and is a full professor of computer science. He is executive director emeritus of Purdue&#x27;s &quot;Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security&quot; (CERIAS), and founded its predecessor, the &quot;COAST Laboratory&quot;. He has stated that his research interests have focused on &quot;the prevention, detection, and remediation of information system failures and misuse, with an emphasis on applied information security. This has included research in fault tolerance, software testing and debugging, intrusion detection, software forensics, and security policies.&quot;

Spafford wrote or co-authored four books on computer and computer security, including &quot;Practical Unix and Internet Security&quot; for O&#x27;Reilly Media, and over 150 research papers, chapters, and monographs. In 1996, he received the Award of Distinguished Technical Communication from the Society for Technical Communication for &quot;Practical Unix and Internet Security&quot;.

As a PhD advisor, Spafford supervised development of the Open Source Tripwire tool coded by his student Gene Kim. Spafford was the chief external technical advisor to the company Tripwire during their first few years. He was also graduate advisor to Dan Farmer who coded the freeware Computer Oracle and Password System (COPS) tool.

In 2009, Spafford discussed on C-SPAN an article in The New York Times that looked at how the Internet had been a conduit for many types of &quot;cybercrime&quot;.

Recent work from Spafford has shown how to deceive adversaries and thus make computing systems more secure, drawing on his multi-disciplinary expertise in information security and psychology.

Spafford is on the board of directors of the Computing Research Association and is the former chairperson of the Association for Computing Machinery&#x27;s (ACM) US Public Policy Committee. He was a member of the President&#x27;s Information Technology Advisory Committee from 2003 to 2005 and an advisor to the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Spaf is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (1997), American Association for the Advancement of Science (1999), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (2000), ISC2 (2008), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2020); he is a Distinguished Fellow of the Information Systems Security Association (2009).

<doc id="976861" wikidata="Q3241038" url="?curid=976861" title="Hurricane Elena">
<text>Hurricane Elena was a strong, destructive and erratic tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States in late August and early September 1985. Threatening popular tourist destinations during the Labor Day weekend, Elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path, triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent. The hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern Florida and eastern Louisiana, though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas. Elena developed on August 28 near Cuba, and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact, it entered the Gulf of Mexico and continued to strengthen. Initially projected to strike the central Gulf Coast, the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on August 30, then stalled just 50 mi (80 km) west of Cedar Key, Florida. Despite predictions that Elena would continue eastward across Florida, the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours, causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves, before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi, on September 2 as a Category 3 major hurricane. The storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on September 4.

The hurricane&#x27;s unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation&#x27;s history. Evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm&#x27;s forecast positions, and many residents and tourists along portions of the Gulf Coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days. Preparations were generally timely and efficient, though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin, and many refugees tried to return home against officials&#x27; orders. About 1.25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone, contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted, and forecasters stressed the storm&#x27;s destructive potential for days.

Elena&#x27;s slow movement off western Florida resulted in severe beach erosion and damage to coastal buildings, roads, and seawalls, especially to those of old or inadequate construction. Destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as Cedar Key and Dog Island, though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland. The hurricane devastated the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry, killing large quantities of oysters, destroying their reefs, and leaving thousands of workers unemployed. Farther west, Dauphin Island in Alabama endured wind gusts as high as and a significant storm surge. The island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by Elena, including several hundred damaged or demolished homes. The rest of the state&#x27;s coast also sustained considerable damage, and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in Alabama and Mississippi.

Over 13,000 homes were damaged in Mississippi, and 200 were destroyed. Cities close to the Alabama border—including Pascagoula—experienced widespread damage to residences, schools, and businesses, and the community of Gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world. Several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the Gulfport area. Wind damage extended into portions of eastern Louisiana. Overall, nine people died as a result of the hurricane: two in Texas due to drownings in rip currents, three in Florida, two in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, and one in a maritime accident in the Gulf of Mexico. Damage totaled about $1.3 billion, and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people. In Elena&#x27;s wake, President Ronald Reagan declared parts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida federal disaster areas, making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing. The name &quot;Elena&quot; was later retired from the cyclical list of Atlantic hurricane names because of the storm&#x27;s effects.

== Meteorological history ==

The origins of Hurricane Elena trace to an easterly tropical wave that was first identified off the western coast of Africa on August 23, 1985. The system sped westward across the Atlantic at up to . Its rapid motion, combined with the presence of an unusually hostile Saharan Air Layer, prevented tropical cyclogenesis for several days. Driven by a strong subtropical ridge to its north, the wave quickly approached North America as it began to show signs of organization. At 00:00 UTC on August 28, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the Windward Passage. The newly designated depression began to track west-northwestward over Cuba, which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development. Despite that, its central barometric pressure continued to deepen, and reconnaissance aircraft found winds exceeding near the center. In response, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Elena over northern Cuba later on August 28.

After passing north of Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents through the morning of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi, within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm&#x27;s center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.

Extrapolation from the storm&#x27;s eastward progress yielded a projected landfall location near Levy County. However, after the passage of the upper-level system early on August 31, steering currents slackened, and Elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern Gulf of Mexico. At its closest, the center of the storm was around from Cedar Key, Florida, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 105 mph (170 km/h). Elena&#x27;s intensity remained consistent, and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed. Early on September 1, Elena reached Category 3 major hurricane status. An area of high pressure soon began to build over the eastern United States, causing Elena to slowly retrograde westward. For much of September 1, the center of the hurricane was within range of the WSR-57 radar station in Apalachicola, Florida, enabling extensive study of small features within the eye and surrounding eyewall. During that period of observation, the previously unobstructed eye became cloud-filled.

The hurricane accelerated on a trajectory toward the central U.S. Gulf Coast, sliding south of the Florida Panhandle. During the afternoon of September 1, the hurricane attained its peak intensity, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft. On the morning of September 2, Elena approached coastal Mississippi from the east-southeast, still at major hurricane status. It came ashore close to Biloxi, which was coincidentally within the hurricane&#x27;s first forecast destination range before its extended detour. Once inland, the hurricane immediately deteriorated, weakening to a tropical storm just hours after landfall, and its center rapidly filled. The system curved northwestward over Mississippi and Louisiana, and despite weakening, it continued to ignite thunderstorm activity which spawned heavy rains. Elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on September 4. Its associated cloud structure became distorted on September 5, and dissipated over Kentucky that same night.

== Preparations ==

The unpredictable nature of the hurricane, in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the Labor Day holiday weekend, severely complicated preparations along the Gulf Coast. Evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with Elena&#x27;s shifts in direction; hurricane warnings were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between Morgan City, Louisiana, and Sarasota, Florida. Much of the northern Gulf Coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm. Evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases. Collectively, this led to the &quot;largest number of people ever evacuated&quot;, according to Robert Case. Some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives, but many stayed relatively local, filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches. Despite the unusually fluid scenario, officials were well aware of the storm&#x27;s destructive power days before its actual landfall. National Hurricane Center hurricane expert Bob Sheets cautioned on August 30 that Elena &quot;will be over a $1 billion storm&quot;.

During Elena&#x27;s initial approach, the first series of hurricane warnings were issued between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Apalachicola, Florida. The storm&#x27;s projected path quickly nudged westward, prompting the warnings to be extended to Morgan City, Louisiana, and truncated to Pensacola, Florida on their eastern reach. Heeding the advisories, nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storm&#x27;s path. Personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern Gulf of Mexico began leaving as early as August 29. The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida declared states of emergency by August 30. Huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies, and simultaneously, lines grew at gas stations. Due to the impending danger, many businesses closed and fortified their buildings. Across the Gulf Coast, classes at schools were cancelled, and residents in the New Orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years (Hurricane Betsy caused catastrophic flooding in and around New Orleans in 1965). In Mississippi, the mass exodus created bumper-to-bumper traffic on crucial highways, such as the west–east U.S. Route 90. In Florida, then-Governor Bob Graham activated 250 National Guard troops on August 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations, stating that 1,600 more were on standby. By that time, it became evident that Elena would head farther east than initially expected, stirring more concern for the eastern Gulf Coast. Accordingly, hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal Louisiana west of Grand Isle and replaced eastward to Apalachicola, Florida.

By the evening of August 30, after Elena&#x27;s sharp turn to the east, hurricane warnings along most of the northern Gulf Coast were discontinued. In accordance, evacuees between Louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle returned home as shelters closed. With the storm&#x27;s new course, the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the Panhandle and the western Florida Peninsula. As such, Governor Graham recommended evacuations south to the Tampa area late on August 30. A mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties, encompassing 573,000 affected individuals. On August 31, Governor Graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground. In response to the heightening danger, most of the National Guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas, and an additional 3,000 were placed on standby.

In the greater St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, area alone, 320,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history. The large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities, highways, and contingencies. Although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of Pinellas County shelters, only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters. Still, official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average, possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives, or increased awareness of available resources. Post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in Pinellas County, and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours, rather than the expected 15. With over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central Florida, evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm. Supplies such as food ran short, and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely. The threat of Hurricane Elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients. Tampa General Hospital, at 84% of patient capacity, was evacuated; four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in Pinellas County were also cleared. Overall, nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety. Although successful, the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.

Late on September 1, when the storm began to retrograde, hurricane warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to Grand Isle, Louisiana, as advisories along the west coast of the Florida Peninsula were allowed to expire. By the time officials lifted evacuation orders, the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety. Roughly 250,000 people in the Florida Panhandle, 175,000 in Alabama, 70,000 in Mississippi, and 50,000 in Louisiana—a total of 545,000—were ordered to leave. Several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier, and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve. Governor Graham&#x27;s office reported that during the entire storm event, 1.25 million people from Florida evacuated at some point, and state police in Louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000. In total, nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire course.

== Impact ==

According to the Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, Hurricane Elena produced Category 3 winds ( or greater) in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. The American Red Cross reported that in addition to the hundreds of single-family homes demolished by the hurricane, over 17,000 sustained some degree of damage; thousands of mobile homes, apartments, and condominiums were also damaged or destroyed. A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center determined the worst of the hurricane&#x27;s effects were focused around Dauphin Island, Alabama, and Pascagoula, Mississippi, though noteworthy damage occurred across large areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, with effects documented as far west as South Padre Island, Texas, and as far north as Kentucky. Nine deaths were attributed to the hurricane in four states and on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and 134 people along Elena&#x27;s path were hospitalized, many of them due to storm-related stress. Power outages plagued the entire region, affecting about 550,000 customers. The National Climatic Data Center compiled a total monetary damage figure of $1.3 billion.

In addition to its effects over land, Elena also affected offshore interests. When a cargo ship close to the hurricane&#x27;s center rolled in high seas on August 29, two unsecured storage containers collided, crushing a man to death. An oil platform operated by Exxon and anchored off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, was ripped from its moorings and reported missing on September 2. The oil rig drifted away before it was spotted by a Coast Guard aircraft. Exxon previously evacuated the platform after rough seas snapped the first two of its eight anchoring cables. Damage was reported on four other offshore platforms, and a oil pipeline broke during the hurricane at an estimated cost of $1.6 million (the same pipeline broke two more times during the 1985 hurricane season).

A large aspect of the hurricane&#x27;s devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern Gulf of Mexico oyster industry, particularly in the Apalachicola Bay area and off the coast of Alabama. Elena subjected the Apalachicola Bay reefs to high winds, strong tidal action, and moderate to heavy rainfall, churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90% of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites. Commercial harvesting was suspended until May 1986, at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern Apalachicola Bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster-catching. Low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water. Thousands of individuals relying on the Apalachicola Bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living; losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass $30 million. All of Alabama&#x27;s major reefs were affected by the hurricane, and its most productive was nearly destroyed. The problem was later confounded in November by Hurricane Kate, which, according to the National Hurricane Center, &quot;[dealt] the final blow&quot; to certain oyster beds.

=== Florida ===

The storm began affecting Florida late on August 28 and early on August 29. In Key West, on the east side of Elena&#x27;s strengthening center, wind gusts exceeded , accompanied by of rain and higher-than-normal tides. Several boats washed ashore at Smathers Beach. Similarly adverse conditions occurred throughout rest of the Keys and across the southern Florida Peninsula; 60 mph (100 km/h) wind gusts and modest rainfall stretched as far east as the Miami area. Easterly winds produced significant wave heights of at West Palm Beach and at Jacksonville, along the Atlantic coast of Florida, by August 31.

Outer rainbands of the large hurricane produced squally weather over parts of northern Florida as early as the morning of August 30. By then, the low-lying coastline near Apalachicola already began to flood. Elena would continue to affect the state for several days as it meandered offshore, resulting in moderate to heavy rainfall. Upwards of accumulated in many locations, peaking at near Cross City and reaching at Apalachicola. Farther south in the Tampa area, the precipitation was less significant, exceeding at Clearwater. Parts of the state&#x27;s northeastern coast—farther away from the hurricane&#x27;s center—also saw formidable rainfall, with a local maximum of at Jacksonville. Still, those totals represented a relatively dry storm, considering its long duration. Despite initial hopes that the hurricane would help alleviate drought conditions across interior portions of southern Florida, precipitation there was generally inconsequential.

Storm-heightened tides extended along the Florida coast as far south as Sarasota and generally ran a modest above normal, though their duration and extent proved noteworthy. The highest recorded storm surge associated with the hurricane was at Apalachicola. The combination of raised water levels and strong waves resulted in severe erosion along many beaches. Many homes near the water were destroyed by the surge, and shoreline structures such as docks, causeways, bridges, low-lying roads, and seawalls sustained substantial damage. Several large fishing piers were either partially or totally destroyed; notably, the city pier at Cedar Key and the popular Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier were both demolished by the hurricane. Debris from the Big Indian Rocks Fishing Pier drifted northward toward Clearwater Pass and accumulated along private beaches at Belleair Shore.

The storm&#x27;s strongest winds remained largely over open waters, although severe gusts still brushed coastal cities and barrier islands. The strongest winds were observed in two areas of the coast: from Cedar Key to Clearwater, and from Apalachicola to Pensacola. Official gust reports included at Cedar Key and nearly at Clearwater; later, on September 2, a gust of was observed at Pensacola along the Florida Panhandle, with sustained winds exceeding . Winds in Franklin County approached by unofficial estimates. The storm&#x27;s effects were not limited to the shore, however, as fallen trees in the inland Tallahassee area damaged around 50 vehicles.

Although Hurricane Elena never crossed Florida&#x27;s coast, its drawn-out interaction with land agitated large swaths of the state&#x27;s western shore. Winds along and around the Pinellas County coast generally blew from the south or southwest for several days, creating persistent onshore flow that built up heavy seas. Near Clearwater, waves reached in height, marked by a period of 13 seconds on August 31. One study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of coastal material per linear foot of shoreline in Escambia County, Gulf, Franklin, and Pinellas counties, with values peaking at 15.6 cubic yards per foot. Along the predominantly marshy coasts of Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus counties, erosion and structural damage were much more limited, partly due to the local southerly or southeasterly wind direction.

In some cases, the hurricane left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands. For example, North Bunces Key—an island of southern Pinellas County—lost most of its vegetation to the storm, and overwashing shifted the southern part of the island up to 330 ft (100 m) from its original settlement. More extensive changes were seen on and near Caladesi Island, which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel. The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south, which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach, allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of the hurricane&#x27;s passage. As a result, Clearwater Beach became connected to Caladesi Island. Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy&#x27;s Cut, which existed until 1991. Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project. Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance, no action was taken.

The hurricane tore two barges from their moorings in Tampa Bay and blew them into Gandy Bridge, leaving the bridge with unspecified damage. Throughout the area, rising waters inundated streets, washed boats ashore, and destroyed numerous homes along the coast. At low-lying Cedar Key to the north, storm surge exceeded . There, and at Alligator Point to the northwest, the surge values represented return periods of 25 to 30 years; elsewhere, they were equivalent to about 10-year events. Floodwaters in Cedar Key rose to in depth, with waves atop the standing water. The extent of structural damage was largely dependent on construction type, as newer, elevated buildings fared much better than older structures nearer sea level. Waterfront restaurants were especially susceptible; winds blew out several large sliding-glass doors at one establishment, allowing both the winds and the tide to enter its interior. Elena severed the sole bridge to Cedar Key, temporarily isolating the city and stranding several residents. The Florida Department of Transportation hurriedly worked to make the bridge passable long enough to rescue the stranded individuals. The hurricane compromised several other roads, destroying a section of State Road 24. Monetary losses in Cedar Key alone were estimated at $2 million, and all major aspects of local infrastructure were severely affected, initially preventing residents from returning home to the island. At least 34 homes and businesses on the island were damaged or destroyed.

Pinellas County suffered some of the worst damage from Hurricane Elena in Florida. At the height of the storm, over 500,000 of its residents were without electricity. Forty-four single-family homes were destroyed, 31 more were damaged, and several condominiums, townhouses, and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed. The hurricane also wrecked or irreparably compromised nearly of coastal bulkheads and inflicted minor damage on more. Most of the affected seawalls were degrading or poorly reinforced. Seawalls with higher standards of construction generally remained intact, though even in those cases, overwash from the Gulf of Mexico topped the barriers and deposited large volumes of sand. The hurricane cost roughly $100 million in Pinellas County.

Elena&#x27;s track parallel to the Florida Panhandle subjected the coastline between Apalachicola and Pensacola Beach to particularly severe conditions that resulted in &quot;significant&quot; property damage there. In Apalachicola proper, winds tore large roofs off buildings, and data from Florida&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources indicate that 20 residences and one community building in Franklin County were damaged or destroyed. Structural failure was prevalent along the county&#x27;s waterfront and on islands such as Dog Island; however, it was mainly limited to poorly constructed buildings. Several miles of roadways in the county sustained significant damage, and about of bulkhead was destroyed. Low seawalls allowed crucial points of the causeway to St. George Island to erode, causing it to fail. In Escambia County, the hurricane left $2 million in damages. Throughout much of the remainder of the Florida Panhandle, structural damage was limited, though 100,000 people in the Pensacola area lost power. The configuration of the southern tip of Cape San Blas in Gulf County was changed by the storm. The hurricane wiped out eagle nests, generated freshwater fish kills, and affected other species of wildlife at the St. Vincent and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuges. St. George Island and Honeymoon Island State Parks were heavily affected, with appreciable but lesser damage in numerous other protected areas. U.S. Route 98, which closely follows the coast in this region, required extensive repairs after being undermined in nearly two dozen locations.

When tropical cyclones move over land, they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability required for the development of weak, embedded supercell thunderstorms, which can produce tornadoes. These tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived, but still capable of producing significant damage. While centered over the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern side of Hurricane Elena&#x27;s circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida. A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1, destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes, and damaging another 118; seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Later that same day, another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg, with much less damage. In nearby Marion County, tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes, compromised another 50 residences, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in total losses, though only minor injuries were reported. At Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Cape Canaveral, a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was being prepared for its first flight. A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees, and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County.

The hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree&#x27;s uprooting was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.

=== Alabama ===

The center of Elena passed 30 mi (50 km) south of mainland Alabama as it accelerated toward the Gulf Coast, affecting the state&#x27;s two-county coast and offshore islands. Wind gusts at Dauphin Island, situated much closer to the hurricane&#x27;s eye, were estimated to have reached ; these velocities represented some of the highest experienced on land from the storm, and were strong enough to snap hundreds of large pine trees. Dauphin Island received an storm surge that resulted in substantial flooding and areas of total overwash. Rainfall amounted to just on the island.

With its location close to the storm&#x27;s center, Dauphin Island saw the greatest damage in Alabama. Access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane, slowing the progression of damage assessments. Additionally, the storm cut power and phone services. Post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island; these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end, and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds. First-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases, entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the Gulf of Mexico. The number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50, though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings. In total, the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on Dauphin Island, accounting for nearly 25% of all homes, and a further 235 sustained substantial damage. An unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.

Windspeeds were markedly lower over mainland Alabama; Mobile recorded winds of over , with gusts as high as . The storm&#x27;s angle of approach created strong offshore winds along the mainland, which depressed water levels and limited the extent of positive surge once winds shifted to onshore. Winds from the hurricane took a toll on crops, ruining of pecans and reducing soybean production by 10%. Farms were still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Frederic in 1979 when Elena struck.

Wave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of Baldwin and Mobile counties, where Elena inflicted about $715,000 worth of damage to roadways. Most damage was concentrated near the shore, where extensive erosion took place, and on islands and minor peninsulas. Farther inland, Elena&#x27;s impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines. The storm destroyed the city boardwalk at Gulf Shores, with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach $300,000. Alabama Power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers. According to the Insurance Information Institute, storm-related damages in Alabama totaled about $100 million. An estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by Hurricane Elena, and another 1,345 sustained lighter damage.

=== Mississippi ===

Along the coast of Mississippi, where Elena made landfall, the most significant effects of the storm stemmed from its strong winds gusting to over . Recorded gusts included at Gulfport, at Pascagoula, and at Biloxi. Several other weather stations clocked sustained winds at over . Consistent with the storm&#x27;s dry nature, rainfall in the state was mainly light and confined to southern and western areas. Gulfport picked up more than , while just over 3 in (75 mm) of rain fell at Natchez. Some streets in Gulfport and Biloxi flooded at the height of the storm. The highest tides ran above normal along the coast, reaching above average at Pascagoula and Ocean Springs. As in Alabama, negative surge values were recorded at the storm&#x27;s onset. The tide gauge at Gulfport recorded a water level of below average early on September 2, before quickly swelling to above normal. Air pressure reportedly fell so rapidly at Pascagoula that car windows began to shatter. The barometer there bottomed out at 953 mb, the lowest pressure recorded on land in association with the cyclone.

The worst of the damage occurred along a stretch of coastline, centered on the Pascagoula area. Elena&#x27;s winds damaged most of the schools in Jackson County, and more specifically, every school in Pascagoula was structurally compromised to some degree. Damages to schools in Ocean Springs totaled $3 million. In the same city, the overall conditions following the hurricane were described as worse than those in the prior hurricanes Frederic or Camille. Elena destroyed 20 houses and two supermarkets in Ocean Springs, and several buildings on every city block sustained severe roof damage due to fallen trees. Two shopping centers were destroyed in nearby Gautier, possibly by short-lived tornadoes. A fire captain in Gautier remarked immediately after the storm that he had not yet seen an unharmed building in the city. The community became essentially isolated from the outside world, and quickly began to run short of food, clean water, and gasoline supplies. Initial reports from Pascagoula also indicated that most, or all, of that city&#x27;s buildings were damaged. Nearly every business in the city was damaged to the extent that none were able to open when the storm cleared. A post-storm assessment by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency revealed over 900 businesses in Jackson County sustained damage, contributing to a total of nearly 1,500 in the state&#x27;s three coastal counties.

Harrison and Hancock counties were generally not affected quite as severely as communities closer to the Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane&#x27;s winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were in a state of disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well. Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection. Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms.

There were numerous reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane&#x27;s effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens&#x27; center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that a significant portion of the damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane&#x27;s nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane&#x27;s synoptic winds.

The storm left 80,000 Mississippi Power Company customers without electricity; most of Jackson County&#x27;s 126,000 residents were affected by the outage. Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard&#x27;s buildings and cranes, and at least two other shipyards in the state were affected by the hurricane. Additionally, the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula. Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Buccaneer State Park, and the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm; at the latter, damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane&#x27;s injured leg. Thirty seafood processing plants were damaged, and one was destroyed. The Red Cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed, and some 13,200 were damaged, 1,200 of them heavily. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290. The overall cost of damage in Mississippi alone approached $1 billion.

===Louisiana===
After moving inland, the storm&#x27;s northwestward track brought it over the Louisiana border on two separate occasions, first reaching Washington Parish as a minimal hurricane. Winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees, damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15,000 customers in the process. The hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strew debris throughout communities such as Bogalusa and Franklinton in Washington Parish, the hardest-hit area in the state. Downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses, chiefly near Bogalusa.

Winds across the rest of the state were moderate, gusting to around at Slidell on the northeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, so damage outside of Washington Parish was sporadic. Throughout the state, at least 40,000 electric customers lost power. Located southwest of the storm&#x27;s core, New Orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions; still, the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought down tree limbs around the city. Levees along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain were able to contain the lake&#x27;s large waves, despite initial fears to the contrary. Still, the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state: one due to a drowning in St. Tammany Parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather. Insured and uninsured damages were worth near $17 million combined, with an additional $500,000 in agricultural losses.

Elena subjected the Chandeleur Islands to a or greater storm surge. The island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland Louisiana against storms, but is frequently reshaped or shrunken by intense hurricanes. Hurricane Danny and Hurricane Juan also affected the islands in 1985. Elena eroded away at least 20% and possibly up to 40% of the Chandeleur Islands&#x27; total land mass and cut 30 significant channels into the island chain. Parts of the islands left intact suffered extensive loss of vegetation. The hurricane, along with Danny and Juan, also affected several other barrier islands, and Elena itself removed as much as of beach along the island of Grand Isle, Louisiana.

===Elsewhere===

Precipitation from Hurricane Elena reached into southern Georgia and parts of South Carolina, with little impact aside from meager drought relief. For several days after landfall, the weakening tropical cyclone produced moderate to heavy rainfall across portions of central and northern Arkansas. Rainfall totals were generally , with locally higher amounts; Mountain Home, Arkansas received of rain, including in just three hours on September 4. Clinton to the south recorded . At the state capital of Little Rock, under of liquid fell. Listed by the National Weather Service among &quot;some of the most significant tropical cyclones to affect Arkansas&quot;, the remnants of Elena triggered flash flooding in parts of four counties; of standing water submerged streets in downtown Hot Springs. In Mountain Home, floodwaters forced 10 families to evacuate their homes, and one person died after a swollen creek swept her car off a bridge spanning it.

Significant rainfall also occurred over parts of western Kentucky, with lighter precipitation in several adjacent states. Over fell at Paducah, where urban streets and low-lying terrain experienced freshwater flooding Floodwaters deep submerged cars to their windows and infiltrated 40 homes, several businesses, a hotel, and a high school. Localized evacuations and road closures were required, and a person wading in an active creek had to be rescued after the creek swept him downstream. Around 10,000 customers lost electric service for a short period due to the storm. Shelters were opened to those displaced by the flooding, but scarcely used.

Early in its formative stages, Elena triggered rainshowers and thunderstorms over parts of Cuba, The Bahamas, and Hispaniola. Later, the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents as far away as South Padre Island, Texas, where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the Labor Day weekend. Both victims were male Texas residents.

==Aftermath==
Hurricane Elena has a multifaceted legacy; it is remembered not only for its severe impacts, but also for its unpredictability and the wide extent of pre-storm preparations.

===Florida===

The state of Florida received a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12. Franklin, Levy, Manatee, and Pinellas counties—where the storm left 5,000 individuals without work—became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited the state and determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing, low-interest loans for rebuilding efforts, and monetary grants. Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal, state, and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs. President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing the total number of Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12. Several major corporations—including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C. Penney—contacted customers in the affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their monthly payments if they had been financially affected by the storm. While only a small number of customers took advantage of the assistance, the companies&#x27; actions were met with highly positive feedback.

In the days following the storm, residents of Cedar Key were forbidden from returning to their homes and businesses while washed-out roadways underwent repairs and debris was cleared. Portable toilets were delivered and clean water trucked in for use while the city&#x27;s infrastructure was being stabilized. After the city of Cedar Key dropped its participation in the National Flood Insurance Program in early 1984, leaving residents unable to purchase flood insurance for their property, the city council voted unanimously to return to the program after Hurricane Elena. Tourism decreased significantly in some areas due to prospective travelers&#x27; concerns about the extent of the damage. The hurricane created a 13% drop in visitors between October 1984 and October 1985 in Pinellas County, marking an early end to the annual &quot;tourist season&quot;, which generally ends after Labor Day weekend; tourist spending fell accordingly.

After the storm, residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians. In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.

To help the Apalachicola Bay shellfish industry recover, special regulations were put in place to monitor harvests, and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts. Using a portion of the funds, out-of-work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs. The state of Florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments. Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.

On September 1 and 2, Florida Power Company received help from Gulf Coast companies to return power to 170,000 customers before the assisting companies&#x27; home areas were struck by the hurricane. Power was restored to most areas by September 4, with an exception being St. George&#x27;s Island; service was expected to be restored after several additional days. More broadly, owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state, which went into effect less than a month after the storm. The new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property&#x27;s prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted. Governor Graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt. Recovery efforts after Hurricane Elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage; for example, beach replenishment at Indian Rocks Beach in Pinellas County began in the summer of 1990.

===Central Gulf Coast===
Power companies from several states sent workers to help restore service to the hardest-hit areas of the Gulf Coast. Most of Alabama Power&#x27;s affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm, though restoration of service to Dauphin Island took significantly longer. Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4. Alabama&#x27;s two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7. Special loan assistance was made available by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration, the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm.

Mississippi Governor William Allain sent 500 members of the National Guard to partner with 200 law enforcement officers along Mississippi&#x27;s coast in minimizing crime, and nighttime curfews were established in several cities. On September 4, President Reagan declared Mississippi&#x27;s coastal counties a Major Disaster area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that as many as 3,000 homes in the state were uninhabitable, their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements. The Small Business Administration approved special loans up to $500,000 for owners of damaged businesses. Mississippi Power Company&#x27;s system was the hardest-hit, and restoration of service was slow; 50,000 of 80,000 customers were still without electricity by September 5.

By September 5, the Salvation Army, Red Cross, and other organizations had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in Mississippi, and federal food stocks became available for the state to distribute to storm victims. Still, resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations, and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen. With dwindling supplies, the Salvation Army had to procure food from other parts of the region to serve to victims. In the days after the hurricane, an increase in heart attack deaths in the Harrison County area was noted.

=== Retirement ===

On account of the widespread damage left behind by the hurricane, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Elena&quot; from the rotating Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists in the spring of 1986, and it will never again be used in the basin. It was replaced by &quot;Erika&quot; for the 1991 season.

<doc id="976867" wikidata="Q513569" url="?curid=976867" title="Earl of Chatham">
<text>Earl of Chatham, of Chatham in the County of Kent, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1766 for William Pitt the Elder on his appointment as Lord Privy Seal, along with the subsidiary title of Viscount Pitt, of Burton Pynsent in the County of Somerset, also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The first earl&#x27;s wife, the former Lady Hester Grenville, daughter of the 1st Countess Temple, had earlier been created the Baroness Chatham, of Chatham in the County of Kent, also in the Peerage of Great Britain, in 1761, as at that stage her husband had wished to remain a member of the House of Commons.

Their second son was William Pitt the Younger, who became the country&#x27;s youngest Prime Minister in 1783, at the age of 24.

Their eldest son, John Pitt, inherited the earldom and viscountcy in 1778 and the barony in 1803. Upon his death in 1835, all three titles became extinct.

==Barons Chatham (1761)==
The second creation of this title came in 1761 in favour of Lady Hester Pitt; the first creation was for John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll and hence the Duke of Argyll.

<doc id="976869" wikidata="Q6880802" url="?curid=976869" title="Mitch Benn">
<text>Mitchell John Benn (born 20 January 1970) is an English comedian, author and musician known for his comedy rock songs performed on BBC Radio. He was, until 2016, a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s satirical programme &quot;The Now Show&quot;, and has hosted other radio shows.

Benn has performed at several music festivals, and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He has also released seven studio albums. His first science fiction novel, entitled &quot;Terra&quot;, was published in July 2013 by Gollancz.

==Early life==
Mitch Benn was born in Liverpool. He was educated at Dovedale Primary School, the then all boys voluntary aided Liverpool Blue Coat School, followed by the University of Edinburgh, where he was a prominent member of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company at the Bedlam Theatre and performed in the Improverts improvised comedy troupe. He began his comedy career in Edinburgh in 1994, moved to London in 1996 and quickly established himself as a comedy club headliner as well as a favourite on the university circuit. He has one son and daughter, Micah and Astrid (born in November 2005 and May 2008 respectively), with his former wife Clara.

==Radio and television==
Benn has often performed on BBC Radio 4 where he was a regular contributor to &quot;The Now Show&quot; from 1999 to 2016, and BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Bad Week&quot; (between 2000 and 2006). He is also an occasional contributor to &quot;Jammin&#x27;&quot; on BBC Radio 2. In 2004 he created his own aptly named series, &quot;Mitch Benn&#x27;s Crimes Against Music&quot; on Radio 4, featuring Robin Ince and Alfie Joey; this has now run to three series. In 2005 he started a series for BBC7 called &quot;The Mitch Benn Music Show&quot; where he plays records of comic songs and invites musical comedians into the studio to perform. He took a small role as &quot;Pseudopodic Creature&quot; in the Quintessential Phase of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; in 2005. Until 2014, he regularly appeared on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Steve Wright Show&quot; as the voice of &quot;Elvis&quot; in the &quot;Ask Elvis&quot; feature.

On television Mitch Benn appeared singing a song about the PlayStation 3&#x27;s yellow light of death on BBC One&#x27;s consumer affairs programme &quot;Watchdog&quot;.

Mitch has performed stand-up on &quot;Live at Jongleurs&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Store&quot; for the Paramount Comedy Channel, as well as two appearances with his band the Distractions (see below) for &quot;The World Stands Up&quot; (Paramount/Comedy Central). He appeared as &quot;King Wonderful&quot; in the CBBC comedy show &quot;Stupid!&quot; and has contributed to a couple of &quot;talking head&quot; nostalgia shows; &quot;X-Rated; The Videos They Tried To Ban&quot; (Channel 4) and &quot;Fifty Greatest Comedy Characters&quot; (Five). He also contributed occasional songs to Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot;.

Benn regularly plays live shows at clubs and festivals in Britain, and has toured extensively overseas, including South Africa, Hong Kong and Singapore. In August 2007 he completed a successful run at the Edinburgh Fringe, performing a two-hour show, &quot;The Mitch Benn Music Club&quot;, with the Distractions. He completed a national UK tour in December 2008, the &quot;Sing Like an Angel&quot; tour, which coincided with the release of his sixth album, of the same name. Mitch Benn toured the UK again during October and November 2009 and continues to play across the country and regularly present a new one man show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Together with the Distractions he runs a monthly musical comedy night at the Phoenix (Cavendish Square) on the first Tuesday of every month called The Distraction Club.

In November 2010 he released &quot;I&#x27;m Proud of the BBC&quot;, a song listing many of the corporation&#x27;s achievements. The track was available for download only and made it to 11th in the Independent Singles Chart.

In September 2013 he took over the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox in the touring production of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Live Radio Show&quot;.

In Autumn 2020 Mitch was a member of the Walruses in Series 16 of the BBC Two quiz show Only Connect alongside actress and writer Emma Kennedy and Mastermind finalist Dan Adler. His team reached the quarter-final round but were eliminated in the 17th episode of the series broadcast on 11 January 2021.

===Twitter===
During the 26th series of &quot;The Now Show&quot; broadcast between March and April 2009 Benn launched an attempt to increase his follows. Annoyed at the fact that only a few people followed him on Twitter, Benn planned to make himself the &quot;King of Twitter&quot; by getting the show&#x27;s 1.5 million listeners to follow his account and therefore have more followers than Stephen Fry, who he claimed was the current king. Within a week of his announcement, the number of people following Benn more than tripled, from about 1,200 followers to just under 4,000. Later in the same series, Benn performed a song expressing his anger that Coldplay beat him into having more followers than Fry first, making remarks that it was not the band themselves posting messages and that as the band has four members, the number of followers should have been divided by four. Benn also mentioned that some of his followers were worried that he was becoming too obsessed with Twitter. In the last episode of the series, Benn wrote what he claimed was his final Twitter song, which specially featured Fry telling Benn that if he renounced his claim as King of Twitter, Fry would make him &quot;Viceroy of Facebook&quot;, which Benn did. Benn also referenced the passing of the one million mark on the site.

In October 2009, &quot;The History of the World Through Twitter&quot;, co-written by Benn and his fellow &quot;Now Show&quot; presenter Jon Holmes, was published by Prion Books.

Together with his wife, Benn runs a Twitter feed for their daughter, Astrid (who was four years old at the time it was created), &quot;Stuff Astrid Says&quot;. They have so far declined to create a Twitter feed for the family dog &quot;Rowlf&quot;, despite requests.

==Albums==
Mitch has released eight CDs to date: &quot;The Unnecessary Mitch Benn&quot; (1998), a collection of favourite live songs, recorded on a Walkman carried in his pocket at various gigs that year; &quot;Radio Face&quot; (2002), including material previously heard on Radio 2 and Radio 4; and, with the Distractions, &quot;Too Late To Cancel&quot; (2004), and &quot;Crimes Against Music&quot; (2005). The single &quot;Everything Sounds Like Coldplay Now&quot; was released in September 2005 as a taster for the album, hitting the lower regions of the UK chart, and, , the video (see external link) is still receiving heavy rotation on the Paramount Comedy Channel. The Distractions are Kirsty Newton of the band Siskin (vocals, bass and keyboard) and Ivan Sheppard (drums), who replaced Tash Baylis (also of Weapons) in 2006. Mitch provides most of the vocals and plays the guitar. As well as touring and releasing material, the band support Mitch Benn for some of his comedy programmes, such as the &quot;Mitch Benn&#x27;s Crimes Against Music&quot;.

In October 2007, a fifth album, &quot;The Official Edinburgh Bootleg 2007&quot; (swiftly dubbed &quot;The Brown Album&quot; because of its mock brown paper cover art), recorded on the final night of his show at the Edinburgh Fringe, was made available exclusively to those who attended his autumn 2007 tour.

<text>Jorge Eduardo Alessandri Rodríguez (; 19 May 1896 – 31 August 1986) was the 26th President of Chile from 1958 to 1964, and was the candidate of the Chilean right in the crucial presidential election of 1970, which he lost to Salvador Allende. He was the son of Arturo Alessandri, who was president from 1920 to 1925 and again from 1932 to 1938.

==Early years==

Jorge Alessandri was born in Santiago. He studied at Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera, prestigious public high school of Santiago, and University of Chile, and after graduating in 1919 worked there as a lecturer. After the fall of the parliamentary republic, he lived in European exile with his parents from 1924 to 1925, but returned to his native land where he was elected to parliament as an independent from a Santiago constituency in 1926.

He withdrew from public life in 1932 to concentrate on business interests, becoming president of the mortgage bank, &quot;Caja de Crédito Hipotecario&quot; until 1938 and running the &quot;Paper and Cardboard Manufacturing Company&quot;. From 1944 to 1947, he was chairman of the Chilean employers&#x27; confederation.

==Return to politics==
The early years of the Presidency of Gabriel González were marked by serious unrest between left and right-wing supporters, and on 2 August 1947 González named a cabinet of military officers and independents in a supposed attempt to depoliticise the situation. Alessandri was named Minister of Finance, where he reordered the system of administration and pursued a rigorous programme of austerity.

By 1950, he had restored order to the public finances and controlled inflation. However, his freezes of public sector remuneration gradually led to greater industrial unrest. Public sector workers came out on strike at the end of January 1950, which rapidly turned into a broad opposition against the government&#x27;s economic policies. Along with the rest of the cabinet, Alessandri resigned on 3 February, and returned to his role as president of the employers&#x27; confederation.

==Senate and presidency==

In 1956, the Liberal Party selected him as a candidate for a Santiago Senate seat, which he won with a substantial majority in 1957. However, Alessandri was seen as rather conservative by the Liberal Party, and in the end it was the moderate wing of the Conservative Party which secured his position as an independent candidate for the Presidency, with his campaign majoring on his economic expertise.

In March 1958, he edged the united left candidate for the Presidency, Salvador Allende by 32.2% to 28.5%, with Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva polling 20.5%. In the event of no candidate securing an overall majority of the popular vote, the choice of president fell to Congress, which duly chose Alessandri, who had a coalition of Conservatives, Liberals and Radical Party congressmen behind him.

Alessandri initially focused, unsurprisingly, on economic issues, particularly on controlling inflation and balancing the state budget, and he liberalised Chile&#x27;s tariff régime. However, he once again froze public sector pay, unleashing widespread industrial unrest.

In May 1960, a strong earthquake struck the densely populated area between Concepción and Puerto Montt, causing more than US$400 million in damage. Reconstruction and relief soon drowned out other issues. The earthquake effectively interrupted and ended Lota&#x27;s coal miners march on Concepción as they were demanding higher salaries.

In 1961, elections to Congress saw massive losses for the Conservatives and Liberals, with the Radicals, alone of the coalition parties, doing well. This forced Alessandri to nominate more Ministers from the Radical Party, which in turned moved his government to the left. This tied in with the more activist foreign development policy pursued by John F Kennedy in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, in the shape of the Alliance for Progress. Together, these unleashed a wave of progressive tax and agricultural reforms. Despite this, distribution of land ownership remained grossly unequal.

Alessandri&#x27;s period of office ended in 1964, and he was succeeded by his opponent of 1958, the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva. Alessandri returned to managing his paper factory.

== Public life after his government ==
On 3 November 1965, in the press published a letter, supported by 900 firms, where directed to Alessandri to analyze the general reality and highlight his public action, thus starting his second presidential candidacy. Publishing in the press in September 1968, a manifesto to the country -subscribed by Guillermo Feliú Cruz, historian; Hugo Galvez Gajardo, former Minister; Adolfo Silva Henríquez, farmer; Jaime Guzmán Errázuriz, university leader; Eduardo Boetsch G. H., engineer; and Jorge Delano Frederick, reporter requested adhesions to promote the presidential candidacy of Jorge Alessandri. Although Alessandri kept a low profile for most of the 1964-1970 period, he never explicitly ruled out a return to politics. On one occasion he said of the Chilean people: &quot;I perceived, and necessarily, the rumor growing tide of discontent, despair and anxiety, inevitable product of just awakened but unsatisfied aspirations.&quot;

==Allende&#x27;s election and Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship==
In 1970, following the end of Frei&#x27;s period in office, Jorge Alessandri sought election as President once again, with his main opponent Salvador Allende, just as in 1958. After another close contest, Allende emerged in front this time, by the narrow margin of 37.3% to 35.8%, with Christian Democrat Radomiro Tomić polling 27.9% on polling day, 4 September. As in 1958, the election went to Congress, this time on 24 October. Although Congress placed a number of conditions on Allende such as his signature of a &quot;Statute of Constitutional Guarantees&quot;, promising not to undermine the Chilean Constitution, Alessandri lost the final vote by a decisive 153–35, with Tomic&#x27;s Christian Democrats supporting Allende.

According to Sergio Riesenberg Alessandri&#x27;s appearance on TV backfired and cost him the election. On the TV program &quot;Decisión 70&quot; directed by Gonzalo Bertrán there were two separate shots that showed him in bad light. In the first Alessandri said that he would be determined and that his &quot;hands would not shake&quot;, subsequently the camera focused his hands that were actually shaking. In the second frame he was seen next to a stove warming his legs with a blanket despite being Spring. According to Riesenberg all this gave the public the impression of a man who was not longer &quot;in an adequate age to become president&quot;.

After the military coup of 11 September 1973 General Augusto Pinochet seized power and formed a government, and in 1976 Alessandri was named President of a newly formed Council of State, which served as advisor to the Junta in matters of legislation, and which also played a role in the drafting of the new constitution. The Council suggested changes to the draft prepared by the Ortúzar Committee, but many of the most important recommendations were dismissed by the Junta. Alessandri did not agree with some of the Junta&#x27;s authoritarian amendments and resigned from the council. The constitution was approved in a national plebiscite held in September 1980 and came into force in March 1981. During the campaign, Alessandri declared he would vote &quot;Yes&quot;, despite his disagreements with the Junta.

==Final years==
After this, Jorge Alessandri once more withdrew into private life, now for the last time, living rather peacefully in his apartment in the center of Santiago. He continued to be chairman of the board of a paper factory until his death in Santiago in 1986. He did not live to see the end of the junta and the return of Chile to democracy.

His death had some influence in the attempted assassination of Augusto Pinochet by Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front as it made Pinochet travel back to Santiago prematurely changing thus the schedule of the attack.

His nephew Arturo Alessandri Besa stood as presidential candidate for the right-wing Alianza in 1993, losing to the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle of the Concertación center-left coalition.

<doc id="976880" wikidata="Q6407638" url="?curid=976880" title="Killian documents controversy">
<text>The Killian documents controversy (also referred to as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six documents containing false allegations about President George W. Bush&#x27;s service in the Texas Air National Guard in 1972–73, allegedly typed in 1973. Dan Rather presented four of these documents as authentic in a &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 presidential election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate them. Several typewriter and typography experts soon concluded that they were forgeries. Lieutenant Colonel Bill Burkett provided the documents to CBS, but he claims to have burned the originals after faxing them copies.

CBS News producer Mary Mapes obtained the copied documents from Burkett, a former officer in the Texas Army National Guard, while pursuing a story about the George W. Bush military service controversy. Burkett claimed that Bush&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian, wrote them, which included criticisms of Bush&#x27;s service in the Guard during the 1970s. In the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment, Rather stated that the documents &quot;were taken from Lieutenant Colonel Killian&#x27;s personal files&quot;, and he falsely asserted that they had been authenticated by experts retained by CBS.

The authenticity of the documents was challenged within minutes on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on anachronisms in the format and typography, and the scandal quickly spread to the mass media. CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for two weeks, but other news organizations continued to scrutinize the evidence, and &quot;USA Today&quot; obtained an independent analysis from outside experts. CBS finally repudiated the use of the documents on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, &quot;if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question&quot;, and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, &quot;Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret.&quot;

Several months later, a CBS-appointed panel led by Dick Thornburgh and Louis Boccardi criticized both the initial CBS news segment and CBS&#x27;s &quot;strident defense&quot; during the aftermath. CBS fired producer Mapes, requested resignations from several senior news executives, and apologized to viewers by saying that there were &quot;substantial questions regarding the authenticity of the Killian documents&quot;.

The story of the controversy was dramatized in the 2015 film &quot;Truth&quot; starring Robert Redford as Dan Rather and Cate Blanchett as Mary Mapes, directed by James Vanderbilt. It is based on Mapes&#x27; memoir &quot;Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power&quot;. Former CBS President and CEO Les Moonves refused to approve the film, and CBS refused to air advertisements for it. A CBS spokesman stated that it contained &quot;too many distortions, evasions, and baseless conspiracy theories&quot;.

==Background and timeline==
The memos, allegedly written in 1972 and 1973, were obtained by CBS News producer Mary Mapes and freelance journalist Michael Smith, from Lieutenant Colonel Bill Burkett, a former US Army National Guard officer. Mapes and Dan Rather, among many other journalists, had been investigating for several years the story of Bush&#x27;s alleged failure to fulfill his obligations to the National Guard.

Burkett had received publicity in 2000, after making and then retracting a claim that he had been transferred to Panama for refusing &quot;to falsify personnel records of [then-]Governor Bush&quot;, and in February 2004, when he claimed to have knowledge of &quot;scrubbing&quot; of Bush&#x27;s Texas Air National Guard records. Mapes was &quot;by her own account [aware that] many in the press considered Burkett an &#x27;anti-Bush zealot&#x27;, his credibility in question&quot;.

Mapes and Smith made contact with Burkett in late August, and on August 24 Burkett offered to meet with them to share the documents he possessed, and later told reporters from &quot;USA Today&quot; &quot;that he had agreed to turn over the documents to CBS if the network would arrange a conversation with the Kerry campaign&quot;, a claim substantiated by emails between Smith and Mapes detailing Burkett&#x27;s additional requests for help with negotiating a book deal, security, and financial compensation. During the last week of August, Mapes asked Josh Howard, her immediate superior at CBS, for permission to facilitate contact between Burkett and the Kerry campaign; Howard and Mapes subsequently disputed whether such permission had been given.

Two documents were provided by Burkett to Mapes on September 2 and four others on September 5, 2004. At that time, Burkett told Mapes that they were copies of originals that had been obtained from Killian&#x27;s personal files via Chief Warrant Officer George Conn, another former member of the TexANG.

Mapes informed Rather of the progress of the story, which was being targeted to air on September 8 along with footage of an interview with Ben Barnes, a former Lieutenant Governor of Texas, who would publicly state for the first time his opinion that Bush had received preferential treatment to get into the National Guard. Mapes had also been in contact with the Kerry campaign several times between late August and September 6, when she spoke with senior Kerry advisor Joe Lockhart regarding the progressing story. Lockhart subsequently stated he was &quot;wary&quot; of contact with Mapes at this stage, because if the story were true, his involvement might undermine its credibility, and if it were false, &quot;he did not want to be associated with it&quot;. Lockhart called Burkett on September 6 at the number provided by Mapes, and both men stated they discussed Burkett&#x27;s view of Kerry&#x27;s presidential campaign strategy, not the existence of the documents or the related story.

===Content of the memos===
The documents claimed that Bush had disobeyed orders while in the Guard, and that undue influence had been exerted on Bush&#x27;s behalf to improve his record. The documents included the following:

#An order directing Bush to submit to a physical examination.
#A note that Killian had grounded Bush from flying due to &quot;failure to perform to USAF / TexANG standards&quot;, and for failure to submit to the physical examination as ordered. Killian also requested that a flight inquiry board be convened, as required by regulations, to examine the reasons for Bush&#x27;s loss of flight status.
#A note of a telephone conversation with Bush in which Bush sought to be excused from &quot;drill&quot;. The note records that Bush said he did not have the time to attend to his National Guard duties because he had a campaign to do (the Senate campaign of Winton M. Blount in Alabama).
#A note (labeled &quot;CYA&quot; for &quot;cover your ass&quot;) claiming that Killian was being pressured from above to give Bush better marks in his yearly evaluation than he had earned. The note attributed to Killian says that he was being asked to &quot;sugarcoat&quot; Bush&#x27;s performance. &quot;I&#x27;m having trouble running interference [for Bush] and doing my job.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; also received copies of the four documents used by CBS, reporting this and publishing them the morning after the CBS segment, along with two additional memos. Burkett was assured by &quot;USA Today&quot; that they would keep the source confidential.

===CBS investigations prior to airing the segment===
Mapes and her colleagues began interviewing people who might be able to corroborate the information in the documents, while also retaining four forensic document experts, Marcel J. Matley, James J. Pierce, Emily Will, and Linda James, to determine the validity of the memos.

On September 5, CBS interviewed Killian&#x27;s friend Robert Strong, who ran the Texas Air National Guard administrative office. Among other issues covered in his interview with Rather and Mapes, Strong was asked if he thought the documents were genuine. Strong stated, &quot;they are compatible with the way business was done at the time. They are compatible with the man that I remember Jerry Killian being.&quot; Strong had first seen the documents twenty minutes earlier and also said he had no personal knowledge of their content; he later claimed he had been told to assume the content of the documents was accurate.

On September 6, CBS interviewed General Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Hodges, a former officer at the Texas Air National Guard and Killian&#x27;s immediate superior at the time. Hodges declined CBS&#x27; request for an on-camera interview, and Mapes read the documents to him over the telephone—or perhaps only portions of the documents; his recollection and Mapes&#x27;s differed. According to Mapes, Hodges agreed with CBS&#x27;s assessment that the documents were real, and CBS reported that Hodges stated that these were &quot;the things that Killian had expressed to me at the time&quot;. However, according to Hodges, when Mapes read portions of the memos to him he simply stated, &quot;well if he wrote them, that&#x27;s what he felt&quot;, and he stated he never confirmed the validity of the content of the documents. General Hodges later asserted to the investigatory panel that he told Mapes that Killian had never, to his knowledge, ordered anyone to take a physical and that he had never been pressured regarding Lieutenant Bush, as the documents alleged. Hodges also claims that when CBS interviewed him, he thought the memos were handwritten, not typed, and following the September 8 broadcast, when Hodges had seen the documents and heard of claims of forgery by Killian&#x27;s wife and son, he was &quot;convinced they were not authentic&quot; and told Rather and Mapes on September 10.

===Response of the document examiners===
Prior to airing, all four of the examiners responded to Mapes&#x27; request for document analysis, though only two to Mapes directly:

*Emily Will noted discrepancies in the signatures on the memos, and had questions about the letterhead, the proportional spacing of the font, the superscripted &quot;th&quot; and the improper formatting of the date. Will requested other documents to use for comparison.
*Linda James was &quot;unable to reach a conclusion about the signature&quot; and noted that the superscripted &quot;th&quot; was not in common use at the time the memos were allegedly written; she later recalled telling CBS, &quot;the two memos she looked at &#x27;had problems.&#x27;&quot;
*James Pierce concluded that both of the documents were written by the same person and that the signature matched Killian&#x27;s from the official Bush records. Only one of the two documents provided to Pierce had a signature. James Pierce wrote, &quot;the balance of the Jerry B. Killian signatures appearing on the photocopied questioned documents are consistent and in basic agreement&quot;, and stated that based on what he knew, &quot;the documents in question are authentic&quot;. However, Pierce also told Mapes he could not be sure if the documents had been altered because he was reviewing copies, not original documents.
*Marcel Matley&#x27;s review was initially limited to Killian&#x27;s signature on one of the Burkett documents, which he compared to signatures from the official Bush records. Matley &quot;seemed fairly confident&quot; that the signature was Killian&#x27;s. On September 6, Matley was interviewed by Rather and Mapes and was provided with the other four documents obtained from CBS (he would prove to be the only reviewer to see these documents prior to the segment). Matley told Rather &quot;he could not authenticate the documents due to the fact that they were poor quality copies&quot;. In the interview, Matley told Rather that with respect to the signatures, they were relying on &quot;poor material&quot; and that there were inconsistencies in the signatures, but also replied &quot;Yes&quot;, when asked if it would be safe to say the documents were written by the person who signed them.
*Both Emily Will and Linda James suggested to Mapes that CBS contact typewriter expert Peter Tytell (son of Martin Tytell). Associate producer Yvonne Miller left him a voicemail on September 7; he returned the call at 11 am on September 8 but was told they &quot;did not need him anymore&quot;.

==September 8 segment and initial reactions==
The segment entitled &quot;For the Record&quot; aired on &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; on September 8. After introducing the documents, Rather said, in reference to Matley, &quot;We consulted a handwriting analyst and document expert who believes the material is authentic.&quot;

The segment introduced Lieutenant Robert Strong&#x27;s interview, describing him as a &quot;friend of Killian&quot; (without noting he had not worked in the same location and without mentioning he had left the TexANG prior to the dates on the memos). The segment used the sound bite of Strong saying the documents were compatible with how business was done but did not include a disclaimer that Strong was told to assume the documents were authentic.

In Rather&#x27;s narration about one of the memos, he referred to pressure being applied on Bush&#x27;s behalf by General Buck Staudt, and described Staudt as &quot;the man in charge of the Texas National Guard&quot;. Staudt had retired from the guard a year and a half prior to the dates of the memos.

Interview clips with Ben Barnes, former Speaker of the Texas House, created the impression &quot;that there was no question but that President Bush had received Barnes&#x27; help to get into the TexANG&quot;, because Barnes had made a telephone call on Bush&#x27;s behalf, when Barnes himself had acknowledged that there was no proof his call was the reason, and that &quot;sometimes a call to General Rose did not work&quot;. Barnes&#x27; disclaimer was not included in the segment.

===Internet skepticism spreads===
Discussion quickly spread to various weblogs in the blogosphere, principally Little Green Footballs and Power Line. The initial analysis appeared in posts by &quot;Buckhead&quot;, a username of Harry W. MacDougald, an Atlanta attorney who had worked for conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and who had helped draft the petition to the Arkansas Supreme Court for the disbarment of President Bill Clinton. MacDougald questioned the validity of the documents on the basis of their typography, writing that the memos were &quot;in a proportionally spaced font, probably Palatino or Times New Roman&quot;, and alleging that this was an anachronism: &quot;I am saying these documents are forgeries, run through a copier for 15 generations to make them look old. This should be pursued aggressively.&quot;

By the following day, questions about the authenticity of the documents were being publicized by the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;, which linked to the analysis at the Powerline blog in the mid-afternoon, and the story was covered on the website of the magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; and broke into mass media outlets, including the Associated Press and the major television news networks. It also was receiving serious attention from conservative writers such as National Review Online&#x27;s Jim Geraghty. By the afternoon of September 9, Charles Foster Johnson of Little Green Footballs had posted his attempt to recreate one of the documents using Microsoft Word with the default settings. The September 9 edition of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; made mention of the controversy, along with an article on the ABC News website.

Thirteen days after this controversy had emerged the national newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot; published a timeline of events surrounding the CBS story. Accordingly, on the September 9 morning after the &quot;60 minutes&quot; report, the broadcast was front-page news in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Additionally, the story was given two-thirds of a full page within &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s news section, which mentioned that it had also obtained copies of the documents. However, the authenticity of the memos was not part of the story carried by major news outlets on that day. Also on that day, CBS published the reaction of Killian&#x27;s son, Gary, to the documents, reporting that Gary Killian questioned one of the memos but stated that others &quot;appeared legitimate&quot; and characterized the collection as &quot;a mixture of truth and fiction&quot;. In an interview with Fox News, Gary Killian expressed doubts about the documents&#x27; authenticity on the basis of his father&#x27;s positive view of Bush.

In 2006, the two Free Republic (Rathergate) bloggers, Harry W. MacDougald, username &quot;Buckhead&quot;, an Atlanta-based lawyer and Paul Boley, username &quot;TankerKC&quot;, were awarded the &quot;Reed Irvine Award for New Media&quot; by the Accuracy in Media watchdog at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).

===CBS&#x27;s response and widening media coverage===
At 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 9, CBS News released a statement saying the memos were &quot;thoroughly investigated by independent experts, and we are convinced of their authenticity&quot;, and stating, &quot;this report was not based solely on recovered documents, but rather on a preponderance of evidence, including documents that were provided by unimpeachable sources&quot;. The statement was replaced later that day with one that omitted this claim.

The first newspaper articles questioning the documents appeared on September 10 in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and in &quot;USA Today&quot; via the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported, &quot;Document examiner Sandra Ramsey Lines ... said she was &#x27;virtually certain&#x27; [the documents] were generated by computer. Lines said that meant she could testify in court that, beyond a reasonable doubt, her opinion was that the memos were written on a computer.&quot;

Also on September 10, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported, &quot;the officer named in one memo as exerting pressure to &#x27;sugarcoat&#x27; Bush&#x27;s military record was discharged a year and a half before the memo was written. The paper cited a military record showing that Col. Walter &#x27;Buck&#x27; Staudt was honorably discharged on March 1, 1972, while the memo cited by CBS as showing that Staudt was interfering with evaluations of Bush was dated August 18, 1973.&quot;

In response to the media attention, a CBS memo said that the documents were &quot;backed up not only by independent handwriting and forensic document experts but by sources familiar with their content&quot; and insisted that no internal investigation would take place. On the CBS Evening News of September 10, Rather defended the story and noted that its critics included &quot;partisan political operatives&quot;.

*In the broadcast, Rather stated that Marcel Matley &quot;analyzed the documents for CBS News. He believes they are real&quot;, and broadcast additional excerpts from Matley&#x27;s September 6 interview showing Matley&#x27;s agreement that the signatures appeared to be from the same source. Rather did not report that Matley had referred to them as &quot;poor material&quot;, that he had only opined about the signatures or that he had specifically not authenticated the documents.
*Rather presented footage of the Strong interview, introducing it by stating Robert Strong &quot;is standing by his judgment that the documents are real&quot;, despite Strong&#x27;s lack of standing to authenticate them and his brief exposure to the documents.
*Rather concluded by stating, &quot;If any definitive evidence to the contrary of our story is found, we will report it. So far, there is none.&quot;

In an appearance on CNN that day, Rather asserted &quot;I know that this story is true. I believe that the witnesses and the documents are authentic. We wouldn&#x27;t have gone to air if they would not have been.&quot;

However, CBS&#x27;s Josh Howard spoke at length by telephone with typewriter expert Peter Tytell and later told the panel that the discussion was &quot;an &#x27;unsettling event&#x27; that shook his belief in the authenticity of the documents&quot;. Producer Mapes dismissed Tytell&#x27;s concerns.
A former vice president of CBS News, Jonathan Klein, dismissed the allegations of bloggers, suggesting that the &quot;checks and balances&quot; of a professional news organization were superior to those of individuals sitting at their home computers &quot;in their pajamas&quot;.

==CBS&#x27;s defense, apology==

As media coverage widened and intensified, CBS at first attempted to produce additional evidence to support its claims. On September 11, a CBS News segment stated that document expert Phillip Bouffard thought the documents &quot;could have been prepared on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter, available at the time&quot;. The Selectric Composer was introduced in 1966 for use by typesetting professionals to generate camera-ready copy; according to IBM archives describing this specialized equipment, &quot;To produce copy which can be reproduced with &#x27;justified&#x27;, or straight left-and right-hand margins, the operator types the copy once and the composer computes the number of spaces needed to justify the line. As the operator types the copy a second time, the spaces are added automatically.&quot; Bouffard&#x27;s comments were also cited by the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in an article entitled &quot;Authenticity backed on Bush documents&quot;. However, the &quot;Globe&quot; soon printed a retraction regarding the title. CBS noted that although General Hodges was now stating he thought the documents were inauthentic, &quot;we believed General Hodges the first time we spoke with him.&quot; CBS reiterated: &quot;we believe the documents to be genuine&quot;.

By September 13, CBS&#x27;s position had shifted slightly, as Rather acknowledged &quot;some of these questions come from people who are not active political partisans&quot;, and stated that CBS &quot;talked to handwriting and document analysts and other experts who strongly insist the documents could have been created in the &#x27;70s&quot;. The analysts and experts cited by Rather did not include the original four consulted by CBS. Rather instead presented the views of Bill Glennon and Richard Katz. Glennon, a former typewriter repairman with no specific credentials in typesetting beyond that job, was found by CBS after posting several defenses of the memos on blogs including Daily Kos and Kevin Drum&#x27;s blog hosted at &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. However, in the actual broadcast, neither interviewee asserted that the memos were genuine.

As a result, some CBS critics began to accuse CBS of expert shopping.

===&quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot;, one week later===
The original document examiners, however, continued to be part of the story. By September 15, Emily Will was publicly stating that she had told CBS that she had doubts about both the production of the memos and the handwriting prior to the segment. Linda James stated that the memos were of &quot;very poor quality&quot; and that she did not authenticate them, telling ABC News, &quot;I did not authenticate anything and I don&#x27;t want it understood that I did.&quot;

In response, &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; released a statement suggesting that Will and James had &quot;misrepresented&quot; their role in the authentication of the documents and had played only a small part in the process. CBS News concurrently amended its previous claim that Matley had authenticated the documents, saying instead that he had authenticated only the signatures. On CNN, Matley stated he had only verified that the signatures were &quot;from the same source&quot;, not that they were authentically Killian&#x27;s: &quot;When I saw the documents, I could not verify the documents were authentic or inauthentic. I could only verify that the signatures came from the same source&quot;, Matley said. &quot;I could not authenticate the documents themselves. But at the same time, there was nothing to tell me that they were not authentic.&quot;

On the evening of September 15, CBS aired a segment that featured an interview with Marian Carr Knox, a secretary at Ellington Air Force Base from 1956 to 1979, and who was Killian&#x27;s assistant on the dates shown in the documents. Dan Rather prefaced the segment on the recorded interview by stating, &quot;She told us she believes what the documents actually say is, exactly, as we reported.&quot; In the aired interview, Knox expressed her belief that the documents reflected Killian&#x27;s &quot;sentiments&quot; about Bush&#x27;s service, and that this belief motivated her decision to reach out to CBS to provide the interview. In response to a direct question from Rather about the authenticity of the memo on Bush&#x27;s alleged insubordination, she stated that no such memo was ever written; she further emphasized that she would have known if such a memo existed, as she had sole responsibility to type Killian&#x27;s memos in that time period. At this point, she also admitted she had no firsthand knowledge of Bush&#x27;s time in the Guard. However, controversially, Knox said later in the interview, &quot;The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real ones.&quot; She went on to say, &quot;I probably typed the information and somebody picked up the information some way or another.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; headline report on this interview, including the phrase &quot;Fake but Accurate&quot;, created an immediate backlash from critics of CBS&#x27;s broadcast. The conservative-leaning &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; proceeded to predict the end of CBS&#x27;s news division.

At this time, Dan Rather first acknowledged there were problems in establishing the validity of the documents used in the report, stating: &quot;If the documents are not what we were led to believe, I&#x27;d like to break that story.&quot;

Copies of the documents were first released to the public by the White House. Press Secretary Scott McClellan stated that the memos had been provided to them by CBS in the days prior to the report and that, &quot;We had every reason to believe that they were authentic at that time.&quot;

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that at least one of the documents obtained by CBS had a fax header indicating it had been faxed from a Kinko&#x27;s copy center in Abilene, Texas, leading some to trace the documents back to Burkett.

===CBS states that use of the documents was a mistake===
As a growing number of independent document examiners and competing news outlets reported their findings about the documents, CBS News stopped defending the documents and began to report on the problems with their story. On September 20 they reported that their source, Bill Burkett, &quot;admits that he deliberately misled the CBS News producer working on the report, giving her a false account of the documents&#x27; origins to protect a promise of confidentiality to the actual source.&quot; While the network did not state that the memos were forgeries, CBS News president Andrew Heyward said,

Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret.

Dan Rather stated, &quot;if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.&quot;

In an interview with Rather, Burkett admitted that he misled CBS about the source of the documents, and then claimed that the documents came to him from someone he claimed was named &quot;Lucy Ramirez&quot;, whom CBS was unable to contact or identify as an actual person. Burkett said he then made copies at the local Kinko&#x27;s and burned the original documents. Investigations by CBS, CNN and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; failed to turn up evidence of &quot;Lucy Ramirez&quot; being an actual person.

On September 21, CBS News addressed the contact with the Kerry campaign in its statement, saying &quot;it is obviously against CBS News standards and those of every other reputable news organization to be associated with any political agenda.&quot;

The next day the network announced it was forming an independent review panel to perform an internal investigation.

==Review panel established==
Soon after, CBS established a review panel &quot;to help determine what errors occurred in the preparation of the report and what actions need to be taken&quot;. Dick Thornburgh, a Republican former governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General under George H.W. Bush, and Louis Boccardi, retired president and chief executive officer and former executive editor of the Associated Press, made up the two-person review board. CBS also hired a private investigator, former FBI agent Erik T. Rigler, to gather further information about the story.

===Findings===
On January 5, 2005, the &quot;Report of the Independent Review Panel&quot; on the September 8, 2004, &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; segment &quot;For the Record Concerning President Bush&#x27;s Air National Guard Service&quot; was released. The purpose of the panel was to examine the process by which the September 8 segment was prepared and broadcast, to examine the circumstances surrounding the subsequent public statements and news reports by CBS News defending the segment, and to make any recommendations it deemed appropriate. Among the Panel&#x27;s conclusions were the following:

:The most serious defects in the reporting and production of the September 8 segment were:
:# The failure to obtain clear authentication of any of the Killian documents from any document examiner;
:# The false statement in the September 8 segment that an expert had authenticated the Killian documents when all he had done was authenticate one signature from one document used in the segment;
:# The failure of &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; management to scrutinize the publicly available, and at times controversial, background of the source of the documents, retired Texas Army National Guard Lieutenant Colonel Bill Burkett;
:# The failure to find and interview the individual who was understood at the outset to be Lieutenant Colonel Burkett&#x27;s source of the Killian documents, and thus to establish the chain of custody;
:# The failure to establish a basis for the statement in the segment that the documents &quot;were taken from Colonel Killian&#x27;s personal files&quot;;
:# The failure to develop adequate corroboration to support the statements in the Killian documents and to carefully compare the Killian documents to official TexANG records, which would have identified, at a minimum, notable inconsistencies in content and format;
:# The failure to interview a range of former National Guardsmen who served with Lieutenant Colonel Killian and who had different perspectives about the documents;
:# The misleading impression conveyed in the segment that Lieutenant Strong had authenticated the content of the documents when he did not have the personal knowledge to do so;
:# The failure to have a vetting process capable of dealing effectively with the production speed, significance and sensitivity of the segment; and
:# The telephone call prior to the segment&#x27;s airing by the producer of the segment to a senior campaign official of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry – a clear conflict of interest – that created the appearance of a political bias.

:Once questions were raised about the September 8 segment, the reporting thereafter was mishandled and compounded the damage done. Among the more egregious shortcomings during the Aftermath were:
:# The strident defense of the September 8 segment by CBS News without adequately probing whether any of the questions raised had merit;
:# Allowing many of the same individuals who produced and vetted the by-then controversial September 8 segment to also produce the follow-up news reports defending the segment;
:# The inaccurate press statements issued by CBS News after the broadcast of the segment that the source of the documents was &quot;unimpeachable&quot; and that experts had vouched for their authenticity;
:# The misleading stories defending the segment that aired on the CBS Evening News after September 8 despite strong and multiple indications of serious flaws;
:# The efforts by &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; to find additional document examiners who would vouch for the authenticity of the documents instead of identifying the best examiners available regardless of whether they would support this position; and
:# Preparing news stories that sought to support the segment, instead of providing accurate and balanced coverage of a raging controversy.

===Panel&#x27;s view of the documents===
The Panel did not undertake a thorough examination of the authenticity of the Killian documents, but consulted Peter Tytell, a New York City-based forensic document examiner and typewriter and typography expert. Tytell had been contacted by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producers prior to the broadcast, and had informed associate producer Yvonne Miller and executive producer Josh Howard on September 10 that he believed the documents were forgeries. The Panel report stated, &quot;The Panel met with Peter Tytell, and found his analysis sound in terms of why he thought the documents were not authentic ... The Panel reaches no conclusion as to whether Tytell was correct in all respects.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The controversy had long-reaching personal, political and legal consequences. In a 2010 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Rather&#x27;s report was ranked on a list of TV&#x27;s ten biggest &quot;blunders&quot;.

===CBS personnel and programming changes===
CBS terminated Mary Mapes and demanded the resignations of &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; Executive Producer Josh Howard and Howard&#x27;s top deputy, Senior Broadcast Producer Mary Murphy, as well as Senior Vice President Betsy West, who had been in charge of all prime time newscasts. Murphy and West resigned on February 25, 2005, and after settling a legal dispute regarding his level of responsibility for the segment, Josh Howard resigned on March 25, 2005.

Dan Rather announced on November 23, 2004, that he would step down in early 2005 and on March 9, his 24th anniversary as anchor, he left the network. It is unclear whether or not Rather&#x27;s retirement was directly caused by this incident. Les Moonves, CEO of CBS, stated &quot;Dan Rather has already apologized for the segment and taken responsibility for his part in the broadcast. He voluntarily moved to set a date to step down from the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; in March of 2005.&quot; He added, &quot;We believe any further action would not be appropriate.&quot;

CBS was originally planning to show a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report critical of the Bush administration justification for going to war in Iraq. This segment was replaced with the Killian documents segment. CBS further postponed airing the Iraq segment until after the election due to the controversy over the Killian documents. &quot;We now believe it would be inappropriate to air the report so close to the presidential election&quot;, CBS spokesman Kelli Edwards said in a statement.

After the Killian documents controversy, the show was renamed &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; to differentiate it from the original &quot;60 Minutes&quot; Sunday edition, and reverted to its original title on July 8, 2005, when it was moved to the 8 p.m. Friday timeslot. It was cancelled in 2005 due to low ratings.

===Mapes&#x27;s and Rather&#x27;s view of the documents===
On November 9, 2005, Mary Mapes gave an interview to ABC News correspondent Brian Ross. Mapes stated that the documents have never been proved to be forgeries. Ross expressed the view that the responsibility is on the reporter to verify their authenticity. Mapes responded with, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the standard.&quot; This stands in contrast to the statement of the president of CBS News that proof of authenticity is &quot;the only acceptable journalistic standard&quot;. Also in November 2005, Mapes told readers of the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;I personally believe the documents are not false&quot; and &quot;I was fired for airing a story that could not definitively be proved false but made CBS&#x27;s public relations department cringe.&quot; As of September 2007, Mapes continued to defend the authenticity of the documents: &quot;the far right blogosphere bully boys ... screamed objections that ultimately proved to have no basis in fact.&quot;

On November 7, 2006, Rather defended the report in a radio interview, and rejected the CBS investigation&#x27;s findings. In response, CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco told the Associated Press, &quot;CBS News stands by the report the independent panel issued on this matter and to this day, no one has been able to authenticate the documents in question.&quot;

Dan Rather continued to stand by the story, and in subsequent interviews stated that he believed that the documents have never conclusively been proven to be forgeries – and that even if the documents are false, the underlying story is true.

=== Rather&#x27;s lawsuit against CBS/Viacom ===
On September 19, 2007, Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and its former corporate parent, Viacom, claiming they had made him a &quot;scapegoat&quot; over the controversy caused by the 2004 &quot;60 Minutes Wednesday&quot; report that featured the Killian documents. The suit named as defendants: CBS and its CEO, Leslie Moonves: Viacom, Sumner Redstone, chairman of both Viacom and CBS Corporation; and Andrew Heyward, the former president of CBS News.

In January 2008, the legal teams for Rather and CBS reached an agreement to produce for Rather&#x27;s attorneys &quot;virtually all of the materials&quot; related to the case, including the findings of Erik T. Rigler&#x27;s report to CBS about the documents and the story.

On September 29, 2009, New York State Court of Appeals dismissed Rather&#x27;s lawsuit and stated that the lower court should have honored CBS&#x27;s request to throw out the entire lawsuit instead of just throwing out parts.

==Authentication issues==
No generally recognized document experts have positively authenticated the memos. Since CBS used only faxed and photocopied duplicates, authentication to professional standards is impossible, regardless of the provenance of the originals.

Document experts have challenged the authenticity of the documents as photocopies of valid originals on a variety of grounds ranging from anachronisms of their typography, their quick reproducibility using modern technology, and to errors in their content and style.

The CBS independent panel report did not specifically take up the question of whether the documents were forgeries, but retained a document expert, Peter Tytell, who concluded the documents used by CBS were produced using current word processing technology.

Tytell concluded ... that (i) the relevant portion of the Superscript Exemplar was produced on an Olympia manual typewriter, (ii) the Killian documents were not produced on an Olympia manual typewriter and (iii) the Killian documents were produced on a computer in Times New Roman typestyle [and that] the Killian documents were not produced on a typewriter in the early 1970s and therefore were not authentic.

==Accusations of bias==
Some critics of CBS and Dan Rather argued that by proceeding with the story when the documents had not been authenticated, CBS was exhibiting media bias and attempting to influence the outcome of the 2004 presidential election. Freelance journalist Michael Smith had emailed Mapes, asking, &quot;What if there was a person who might have some information that could possibly change the momentum of an election but we needed to get an ASAP book deal to help get us the information?&quot; Mapes replied, &quot;that looks good, hypothetically speaking of course&quot;. The Thornburgh–Boccardi report found that Mapes&#x27; contact with Kerry adviser Joe Lockhart was &quot;highly inappropriate&quot;, and that it &quot;crossed the line as, at a minimum, it gave the appearance of a political bias and could have been perceived as a news organizations&#x27; assisting a campaign as opposed to reporting on a story&quot;; however, the Panel did not &quot;find a basis to accuse those who investigated, produced, vetted or aired the Segment of having a political bias&quot;. In a later interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, when asked about the issue of political bias, review panel member Louis Boccardi said &quot;bias is a hard thing to prove&quot;. The panel concluded that the problems occurred &quot;primarily because of a rush to air that overwhelmed the proper application of the CBS News Standards&quot;.

Some Democratic critics of Bush suggested that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media&#x27;s reporting on Bush&#x27;s National Guard service. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, suggested that the memos might have originated with long-time Bush strategist Karl Rove. McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, &quot;I can tell you that nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents&quot;, he said. &quot;I&#x27;m just saying that I would ask Karl Rove the same question.&quot; McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, Ralph Reed, had &quot;a known history of dirty tricks&quot;, and he asked whether Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant Roger Stone. At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove&#x27;s objectives: &quot;Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush&#x27;s draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away.&quot; After being criticized, Hinchey responded, &quot;I didn&#x27;t allege I had any facts. I said this is what I believe and take it for what it&#x27;s worth.&quot;

Rove and Stone have denied any involvement. In a 2008 interview in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Stone said &quot;It was nuts to think I had anything to do with those documents ... [t]hose papers were potentially devastating to George Bush. You couldn&#x27;t put them out there assuming that they would be discredited. You couldn&#x27;t have assumed that this would rebound to Bush&#x27;s benefit. I believe in bank shots, but that one was too big a risk.&quot;

<text>William Lacy Clay Sr. (born April 30, 1931) is an American politician from Missouri. As Congressman from Missouri&#x27;s first district, he represented portions of St. Louis in the U.S. House of Representatives for 32 years.

==Early life and family==
Clay was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Luella S. (Hyatt) and Irving Charles Clay. He graduated from Saint Louis University in 1953. Clay served in the United States Army from 1953 to 1955, and was a St. Louis alderman from 1959 to 1964. Clay served 105 days in jail for participating in a civil rights demonstration in 1963. Prior to entering Congress, Clay held jobs first as a real-estate broker and later as a labor coordinator. He worked for the union of St. Louis city employees from 1961 to 1964 and then with a steamfitters union local until 1967.

Clay married Carol Ann Johnson in 1953. They had three children, including William Lacy Clay Jr., who would succeed his father in the U.S. House. The Clay family were parishioners at the predominantly black St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church in St. Louis.

==Politics==

Clay was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1968. He became an advocate for environmentalism, labor issues, and social justice. In 1993, Clay voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act. From 1991 until the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1995, Clay chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service. In 2000, he retired from the House, and his son, Lacy, succeeded him.

==Honors==
In 1996, the William L. Clay Center for Molecular Electronics (now the Center for Nanoscience) was dedicated in his honor on the campus of the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

Clay is also the founder of the William L. Clay Scholarship and Research Fund, which awards college scholarships to high-school seniors living in Missouri&#x27;s First Congressional District. The Fund, which is a 501(c)3 organization, has awarded scholarships since 1985.

The Poplar Street Bridge, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois, was renamed Congressman William L. Clay Bridge on October 7, 2013.

William L. Clay has a star and biographical plaque on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

<doc id="976891" wikidata="Q1329347" url="?curid=976891" title="Eli M. Black">
<text>Eli Menashe Black (April 9, 1921 – February 3, 1975) was an American businessman. He controlled the United Brands Company. His son Leon Black co-founded the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.

==Early life and education==
Born Elihu Menashe Blachowicz as the youngest of three children to Chaje Schulson and Benzion “Benjamin” Blachowicz in Lublin, Poland, he immigrated to the United States along with his mother and sisters via the SS Republic on February 19, 1925 to join their father in New York City. The Yiddish-speaking family lived in Lower East Side, where his father worked as a &quot;shohet&quot;. He attended Yeshiva University, and graduated at the top of his class in 1940. He also received training to be an Orthodox Jewish rabbi and served as the rabbi of a congregation in Woodmere, New York for three and a half years prior to entering business.

==Business career==
Black&#x27;s business career began in investment banking with Lehman Brothers, and then the American Securities Corporation, where he worked on financing for the American Seal-Kap Company, a company that made caps for milk bottles. He was hired to be their chairman and chief executive officer in 1954. Black renamed the company AMK, after its ticker symbol, and turned it into a vehicle for acquisitions, joining the conglomerate bandwagon of the 1960s. Among his many takeovers was the John Morrell &amp; Co. meatpacking company. AMK joined the nation&#x27;s top 500 companies in 1967. In September 1968, Black bought 10% of the outstanding shares of United Fruit on the open market, while outbidding other companies, and gained a controlling interest.

In 1970, AMK merged with United Fruit Company, and adopted the name United Brands. Black became chairman, president, and CEO. At that time, United Fruit was importing about a third of all the bananas sold in the US and owned the Chiquita banana brand. But Black soon discovered that United Fruit had far less capital than he had believed. The company soon became crippled with debt. The company&#x27;s losses were exacerbated by Hurricane Fifi in 1974, which destroyed many of its banana plantations in Honduras. In 1974, United Brands reported losses of $40 million for the first three quarters of the year. Black struggled to keep the company solvent, and in December United Brands announced that it was selling its interest in Foster Grant, Inc. for $70 million.

==Death==
On February 3, 1975, Black went to his office on the forty-fourth floor of the Pan Am Building in Manhattan. At about 8:00 a.m., he fell to his death, landing on the northbound Park Avenue Viaduct beside motorists. Homicide detectives concluded that the quarter-inch glass window was broken with Black&#x27;s attaché case and classified his death a suicide. A few weeks later the Securities and Exchange Commission uncovered a $1.25 million bribe that United Brands paid to Honduran president Oswaldo López Arellano under authorization by Black in order to obtain a reduction of taxes on banana exports.

After Black&#x27;s death, Seymour Milstein and Paul Milstein bought into United Fruit.

==Personal life==
Black was married to artist Shirley Lubell (sister of Oklahoma oil executive Benedict I. Lubell and art dealer Grace Borgenicht Brandt). They had two children: daughter Judy Schlosberg and son Leon Black, founding member of private equity firm Apollo Management.

Black served as a trustee of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, The American Jewish Committee, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Babson College, the Jewish Guild for the Blind, and the Jewish Museum. He had also served as chairman of the &quot;Commentary Magazine&quot; publication committee. The Eli M. Black Lifelong Learning Center at the Park Avenue Synagogue is named in his honor.

==Cultural references==
The 1994 film &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; included a scene resembling Black&#x27;s suicide.

<doc id="976897" wikidata="Q1709076" url="?curid=976897" title="Cone Nebula">
<text>The Cone Nebula is an H II region in the constellation of Monoceros. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 26, 1785, at which time he designated it H V.27. The nebula is located about 830 parsecs or 2,700 light-years from Earth. The Cone Nebula forms part of the nebulosity surrounding the Christmas Tree Cluster. The designation of NGC 2264 in the New General Catalogue refers to both objects and not the nebula alone.

==Description==
The diffuse Cone Nebula, so named because of its apparent shape, lies in the southern part of NGC 2264, the northern part being the magnitude-3.9 Christmas Tree Cluster. It is in the northern part of Monoceros, just north of the midpoint of a line from Procyon to Betelgeuse.

The cone&#x27;s shape comes from a dark absorption nebula consisting of cold molecular hydrogen and dust in front of a faint emission nebula containing hydrogen ionized by S Monocerotis, the brightest star of NGC 2264. The faint nebula is approximately seven light-years long (with an apparent length of 10 arcminutes), and is 2,700 light-years from Earth.

The nebula is part of a much larger star-forming complex—the Hubble Space Telescope was used to capture images of forming stars in 1997.

<text>Street is a lunar impact crater located just to the south of the prominent ray crater Tycho. Street lies within the skirt of high-albedo ejecta from Tycho, and it is more heavily worn than its younger and larger neighbor. There are several smaller craters joined to the western rim, as well as two craters along the eastern rim. The floor is relatively smooth and flat, except for a small craterlet in the western half. The crater is in diameter and in depth. It may be from the Pre-Imbrian period, which lasted from 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago. It is named for the 17th-century English astronomer Thomas Street.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Street.

<text>Scott Patterson (born September 11, 1958) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Luke Danes in &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2007) and Peter Strahm in the &quot;Saw&quot; film series (2007–2009). He also starred as Michael Buchanan in the NBC drama series &quot;The Event&quot; and as a Tenctonese alien commander in the TV film &quot;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&quot;. Since 2023, Patterson has played the recurring role of Harry &#x27;Sully&#x27; Sullivan on the Canadian television series &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Crossing.&quot;

== Early life ==
Patterson was born on September 11, 1958, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in Haddonfield, New Jersey. He attended Haddonfield Memorial High School, graduating in 1977, before attending Rutgers University, where he pursued a degree in comparative literature, eventually leaving college to play baseball. He studied acting in New York with coaches Robert Lewis and Sondra Lee. He was exposed to the teachings of Paul Newman, Arthur Penn, and Frank Corsaro at the Actors Studio, where he also participated in the Producer&#x27;s Unit Penn chaired. He appeared in numerous productions, including &quot;Rasputin&quot; and &quot;Miss Julie&quot;.

== Baseball career ==

Patterson spent seven years, from to , as a professional pitcher in minor league baseball, topping out at the Triple-A level, the highest before the major leagues. He played in two major-league farm systems for seven different minor-league teams and was selected to four all-star teams (two with Atlanta and two with the New York Yankees). Patterson was initially selected by the Atlanta Braves in the first round (12th overall) of the 1980 Major League Baseball secondary draft (an event distinct from the amateur draft). He played his first pro season with their Class A Anderson Braves in 1980. In 1981 Patterson won 13 consecutive games as a starting pitcher between Class A Durham and Double-A Savannah to set a Braves record for most consecutive wins to start a season. He was named the Braves Minor League Pitcher of the Month twice.

Patterson was traded from the Braves to the New York Yankees for Bob Watson on April 23, 1982, and was placed on the Yankees Major League roster in 1983. Patterson was named as an All-Star both with the Yankees&#x27; Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees and Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 1986. In 1985 he was selected by the Texas Rangers in the Rule 5 draft but subsequently returned to the Yankees. While in the Yankees organization Patterson was named their minor league Pitcher of the Month once, and Pitcher of the Week three times. Patterson also pitched in the Puerto Rican Winter League with the Lobos de Arecibo in 1984–85, and the Dominican Professional Baseball League with Santo Domingo in 1985–86. Patterson signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers affiliate, the Albuquerque Dukes, in late 1986 but never played at the major league level.

== Acting career ==
In 1993, Patterson was slated to play the lead in Castle Rock&#x27;s &quot;Little Big League&quot; opposite Sela Ward. The producers recast the role at the last minute with &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; star Timothy Busfield, opting to offer Patterson the role of Mike McGrevey.

Patterson completed filming the leading role in the feature film &quot;Her Best Move&quot;, directed by Norm Hunter and co-starring Lisa Darr. He also appeared on the big screen in &quot;Little Big League&quot;, with Jason Robards, and in &quot;Three Wishes&quot;, with Patrick Swayze and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. He also appeared in the independent films &quot;Highway 395&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody in Bloom&quot; with Penelope Ann Miller and Ron Silver, &quot;Boys of Abu Ghraib&quot; with Sean Astin, and &quot;Other People&#x27;s Children&quot; with Diane Marshall-Green.

On television, he has landed romantic roles; his most notable role, which he played for seven years on the television show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, is Luke Danes, the backwards baseball cap-wearing on-again, off-again love interest of the show&#x27;s protagonist, Lorelai Gilmore, played by Lauren Graham.

On &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Patterson&#x27;s character was deemed &quot;spongeworthy&quot; by Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). In the &quot;Das Boob&quot; episode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, his character had a profound effect on Grace (Debra Messing). Patterson also played the love interests of Jennifer Grey in &quot;It&#x27;s Like, You Know&quot; and Sharon Lawrence&#x27;s character in &quot;Fired Up&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;Arli$$&quot; and &quot;Get Real&quot;.

Among Patterson&#x27;s recent projects are a co-starring role on &quot;Aliens in America&quot; and voicing the character of King Faraday in the 2004 animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, from Warner Bros. Animation. He has also starred as Agent Strahm in two iterations of the Saw franchise, &quot;Saw IV&quot; and &quot;Saw V&quot;.

Patterson appeared in some episodes of the second season of &quot;90210&quot; as Liam Court&#x27;s ex-con father who has recently been released from prison and wants to reconnect with his son.

Patterson starred as Michael Buchanan in the NBC drama series &quot;The Event&quot;, which premiered on September 20, 2010. His character was killed off in episode 18.

In 2016, Patterson reprised his role as Luke Danes for the revival miniseries &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;, which streamed on Netflix on November 25, 2016, and consisted of four 90-minute episodes featuring most of the original cast.

Since 2023, Patterson has played the recurring role of Harry &#x27;Sully&#x27; Sullivan on the Canadian television series &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Crossing.&quot;

<doc id="976909" wikidata="Q598221" url="?curid=976909" title="Japanese battleship Yamashiro">
<text>was the second of two dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Launched in 1915 and commissioned in 1917, she initially patrolled off the coast of China, playing no part in World War I. In 1923, she assisted survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake.

&quot;Yamashiro&quot; was modernized between 1930 and 1935, with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style. Nevertheless, with only 14-inch guns, she was outclassed by other Japanese battleships at the beginning of World War II, and played auxiliary roles for most of the war.

By 1944, though, she was forced into front-line duty, serving as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During fierce night fighting in the early hours of 25 October against a superior American and Australian force, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was sunk by torpedoes and naval gunfire. Nishimura went down with his ship, and only 10 crewmembers survived.

== Description ==
The ship had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . &quot;Yamashiro&quot; displaced at standard load and at full load. Her crew consisted of 1,198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and about 1,400 in 1935.

During the ship&#x27;s modernization during 1930–35, her forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to her tripod foremast. Her rear superstructure was rebuilt to accommodate mounts for anti-aircraft (AA) guns and additional fire-control directors. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was also given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor. In addition, her stern was lengthened by . These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draft to . Her displacement increased nearly to at deep load.

===Propulsion===
The ship had two sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara-type water-tube boilers, each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her sea trials, reaching at .

During her modernization, the Miyahara boilers were replaced by six new Kanpon oil-fired boilers fitted in the former aft boiler room, and the forward funnel was removed. The Brown-Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of . On her trials, &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Fusō&quot; reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ship was increased to a total of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at a speed of .

===Armament===
The twelve 45-calibre 14-inch guns of &quot;Yamashiro&quot; were mounted in six twin-gun turrets, numbered one through six from front to rear, each with an elevation range of −5 to +30 degrees. The turrets were arranged in an unorthodox 2-1-1-2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft; the middle turrets were not superfiring, and had a funnel between them. The main guns and their turrets were modernized during the ship&#x27;s 1930 reconstruction; the maximum elevation of the main guns was increased to +43 degrees, increasing their maximum range from . Initially, the guns could fire at a rate of 1.5 rounds per minute, and this was also improved during her first modernization.

Originally, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50-caliber 6-inch guns mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull. Each gun could fire a high-explosive projectile to a maximum range of at up to six shots per minute. She was later fitted with six high-angle 40-caliber three-inch AA guns, in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure and both sides of the second funnel, as well as on both sides of the aft superstructure. These guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a shell at a rate of 13 to 20 rounds per minute to a maximum height of . The ship was also fitted with six submerged torpedo tubes, three on each broadside.
During &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s modernization in the early 1930s, all six three-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 40-caliber 127-millimeter dual-purpose guns, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.

The improvements made during the reconstruction increased &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s draft by ; the two foremost six-inch guns were removed, as the same guns on her sister ship had gotten soaked in high seas after that ship&#x27;s reconstruction. The ship&#x27;s light-AA armament was augmented by eight 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in twin-gun mounts. Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure, one on each side of the funnel and two on the rear superstructure. This was the standard Japanese light-AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. The configuration of the AA guns varied significantly over time; in 1943, 17 single and two twin-mounts were added for a total of 37. In July 1944, the ship was fitted with another 17 single, 15 twin and eight triple-mounts, for a total of 92 anti-aircraft guns in her final configuration. The gun had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.

Also in July 1944, the ship was provided with three twin-gun and 10 single mounts for the license-built 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was only . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

===Armor===
The ship&#x27;s waterline armor belt was thick; below it was a strake of armor. The deck armor ranged in thickness from . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates. The sides of the conning tower were thick. Additionally, the vessel contained 737 watertight compartments (574 underneath the armor deck, 163 above) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage.

During her first reconstruction &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s armor was substantially upgraded. The deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of . A longitudinal bulkhead of of high-tensile steel was added to improve the underwater protection.

===Aircraft===

&quot;Yamashiro&quot; was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, the first Japanese ship to do so. During her modernization in the 1930s, a catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the stern, and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M biplanes, from 1942 on.

===Fire control and sensors===
The ship was originally fitted with two and two rangefinders in her forward superstructure, a rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2, and 4.5-meter rangefinders in Turrets 3, 4, and 5.

While in drydock in July 1943, a Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on her mainmast.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Yamashiro&quot;, named for Yamashiro Province, the former province of Kyoto, was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 20 November 1913 and launched on 3 November 1915. She was completed on 31 March 1917 with Captain Suketomo Nakajima in command, and was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–1918. She did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in East Asia by the time she was completed, but she did patrol off the coast of China briefly during the war. On 29 March 1922, a Gloster Sparrowhawk fighter successfully took off from the ship. She aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923. Little detailed information is available about &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to Ryojun Guard District, in Manchuria, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China.

The ship&#x27;s reconstruction began on 18 December 1930 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal where her machinery was replaced, her armor was reinforced, and torpedo bulges were fitted. &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s armament was also upgraded and her torpedo tubes were removed. Captain Chuichi Nagumo assumed command of the ship on 15 November 1934, her modernization was completed on 30 March 1935, and she became flagship of the Combined Fleet. Captain Masakichi Okuma relieved Nagumo on 15 November and he, in turn, was replaced by Captain Masami Kobayashi on 1 December 1936. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; began a lengthy refit on 27 June 1937 and Captain Kasuke Abe assumed command on 20 October. Her refit was completed on 31 March 1938 and Captain Kakuji Kakuta relieved Abe on 15 November. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes. Captain Chozaemon Obata assumed command on 24 May 1941 and &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was assigned to the 1st Fleet&#x27;s 2nd Division, consisting of the two &quot;Fusō&quot;-class and the two s.

===World War II===

&quot;Yamashiro&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Fusō&quot; spent most of the war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; chased the Doolittle Raider force that had just launched an air raid on Tokyo, but returned four days later without having made contact. On 28 May, she set sail, commanded by Captain Gunji Kogure, with the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division and the Aleutian Support Group at the same time most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI). Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division was composed of Japan&#x27;s four oldest battleships, including &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the squadron as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed. They were not needed, and &quot;Yamashiro&quot; returned to home waters where she was employed mostly for training duties, in the Inland Sea till 1 February 1943 and at Yokosuka until September, when she became a training ship for midshipmen.

In an effort to replace the aircraft carriers lost at the Battle of Midway, the Navy made plans to convert the two &quot;Fusō&quot;-class ships to hybrid battleship/carriers, but the two &quot;Ise&quot;-class battleships were chosen instead. In July 1943, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was at the Yokosuka drydock for fitting of a radar and additional 25 mm AA guns. The ship was briefly assigned as a training ship on 15 September before loading troops on 13 October bound for Truk Naval Base, arriving with the battleship on the 20th. The two battleships sailed for Japan, accompanied by the carriers and , on 31 October. On 8 November, the submarine fired torpedoes at &quot;Jun&#x27;yo&quot; that missed, but hit &quot;Yamashiro&quot; with a torpedo that failed to detonate. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; resumed her training duties in Japan, and Captain Yoshioki Tawara assumed command. He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 May, but died of natural causes four days later, and Captain Katsukiyo Shinoda was appointed to replace him.

During the US invasion of Saipan in June 1944, Japanese troop ships attempting to reinforce the defenses were sunk by submarines. Shigenori Kami, chief of operations of the Navy Staff, volunteered to command &quot;Yamashiro&quot; to carry troops and equipment to Saipan. If the ship actually reached the island, he intended to deliberately beach the ship before it could be sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island. After Ryūnosuke Kusaka, Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet, also volunteered to go, Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō approved the plan, known as Operation &quot;Y-GO&quot;, but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June.

The ship was refitted in July at Yokosuka, where additional radar systems and light AA guns were fitted. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; and her sister ship were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the 2nd Fleet on 10 September. The ship briefly became the division&#x27;s flagship under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura until 23 September when he transferred his flag to &quot;Fusō&quot;. They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga Island, carrying the Army&#x27;s 25th Independent Mixed Regiment, and escaped an attack by the submarine the next day. They arrived on 4 October, where Nishimura transferred his flag back to &quot;Yamashiro&quot;. The ships then transferred to Brunei to offload their troops and refuel in preparation for Operation &quot;Shō-Gō&quot;, the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the invasion of Leyte.

====Battle of Surigao Strait====
As flagship of Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force, &quot;Yamashiro&quot; left Brunei at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east into the Sulu Sea and then to the northeast into the Mindanao Sea. Intending to join Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s force in Leyte Gulf, they passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships and cruisers lying in wait. The Battle of Surigao Strait would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

At 09:08 on 24 October, &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, &quot;Fusō&quot; and the heavy cruiser &quot;Mogami&quot; were spotted by a group of 27 planes, including Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers escorted by Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, coming from the carrier . Around 20 sailors on &quot;Yamashiro&quot; were killed by strafing and rocket attacks, and the ship listed by almost 15 degrees after a bomb&#x27;s near miss damaged the hull and flooded the starboard bilge, until counter-flooding in the port bilge righted the ship.

Nishimura issued a telegram to Admiral Soemu Toyoda at 20:13: &quot;It is my plan to charge into Leyte Gulf to [reach] a point off Dulag at 04:00 hours on the 25th.&quot; At 22:52, his force opened fire, damaging and and forcing them to retreat before they could launch their torpedoes. Three American destroyers launched torpedoes at 03:00 that morning, hitting &quot;Fusō&quot; at 03:08 and forcing her to fall out of formation. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; opened fire with her secondary battery seven minutes later. Around 03:11, the destroyers &quot;Monssen&quot; and &quot;Killen&quot; fired their torpedoes, one or two of which hit &quot;Yamashiro&quot; amidships. The resulting damage temporarily slowed the ship down, gave her a list to port and forced the flooding of the magazines for the two aft turrets. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; may have been hit a third time near the bow at 03:40. In exchange &quot;Yamashiro&#x27;s&quot; secondary hit &quot;PT 493&quot;, with the intense damage resulting in &quot;PT 493&quot; running aground and eventually sinking, &quot;Yamashiro&#x27;s&quot; first and only kill on an enemy warship.

At 03:52, the battleship was attacked by a large formation to the north commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf. First came 6- and shells from three heavy cruisers, , , and , and four light cruisers, , , and . Six battleships formed a battle line; the Pearl Harbor veteran was the first to open fire a minute later, scoring at least one hit with shells in the first salvo, followed by and . Hampered by older radar equipment, joined the fight late, never fired, and managed to fire exactly one salvo—the last of the engagement. The Australian heavy cruiser HMAS &quot;Shropshire&quot; also had radar problems and did not begin firing until 03:56.

The main bombardment lasted 18 minutes, and &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was the only target for seven of them. The first rounds hit the forecastle and pagoda mast, and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; two forward turrets targeted her assailants, and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing &quot;Mogami&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Asagumo&quot;. The ship continued firing in all directions, but was not able to target the battleships with the other four operable 14-inch guns of her amidships turrets until almost 04:00, after turning west. There was a big explosion at 04:04, possibly from one of the middle turrets. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; increased her firing rate between 04:03 and 04:09, despite the widespread fires and damage, and was hit during this time near the starboard engine room by a torpedo. By 04:09, her speed was back up to 12 knots, and Nishimura wired to Kurita: &quot;We proceed till totally annihilated. I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre-arranged. Please rest assured.&quot; At the same time, Oldendorf issued a brief cease-fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer &quot;Albert W. Grant&quot; was taking friendly fire, and the Japanese ships also ceased fire.

&quot;Yamashiro&quot; increased speed to 15 knots in an attempt to escape the trap, but she had already been hit by two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived, many of whom refused rescue.

====Wreck====

John Bennett claimed to have discovered &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s wreck in April 2001, but confirmation of the wreck&#x27;s identity could not be made. On 25 November 2017, Paul Allen and his crew aboard the research ship RV &quot;Petrel&quot;, discovered the wreck of &quot;Yamashiro&quot; and confirmed her identity. The ship was found upside down and mostly intact, with the bow folded back over the hull.

<text>Pictet is a lunar impact crater located just to the east of the larger and more prominent impact crater Tycho. The high-albedo rays and ejecta from Tycho lie across Pictet and spread far to the east and in other directions. Pictet is older than Tycho and is somewhat worn by past impacts. The slightly smaller crater Pictet A intrudes slightly into the southwest rim. The larger crater Pictet E is nearly joined to the north rim. To the east is Saussure, and to the northeast is the larger, worn formation Orontius.

Swiss physicist Marc-Auguste Pictet (eponym of Pictet crater) was the student and later colleague and friend of Horace-Bénédict de Saussure (eponym of nearby Saussure crater).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pictet.

<doc id="976931" wikidata="Q1515577" url="?curid=976931" title="Fire-bellied toad">
<text>The fire-bellied toads are a group of six species of small frogs (most species typically no longer than ) belonging to the genus Bombina.

The name &quot;fire-bellied&quot; is derived from the brightly colored red- or yellow-and-black patterns on the toads&#x27; ventral regions, which act as aposematic coloration, a warning to predators of the toads&#x27; reputedly foul taste. The other parts of the toads&#x27; skins are green or dark brown. When confronted with a potential predator, these toads commonly engage in an unkenreflex, &quot;Unken-&quot; being the combining form of &quot;Unke&quot;, German for fire-bellied toad. In the unkenreflex, the toad arches its back, raising its front and back legs to display the aposematic coloration of its ventral side.

== Species ==
The currently recognized species are:
==Biology==
The female of the species typically lays 80–300 eggs that can be found hanging off plant stems. The offspring develop in pools or puddles. Their metamorphosis is complete within a few weeks, peaking in July–August. The toadlets attain a length of 12–15 mm. The eggs, laid in August, metamorphose only after the winter, with the toadlets attaining a length of 3–5 cm. These toadlets still have white bellies.

Tadpoles eat mainly algae and higher plants. The young toads and the adult toads consume insects, such as flies and beetles, shrimp and larvae; but also annelid worms and terrestrial arthropods. Fire-bellied toads are sometimes active during the day, but are more so during the night. The mating call of the male sounds like a dog&#x27;s bark, rather than the typical drawn out croaking groan.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species can be found both in Europe and in areas in Asia with a moderate climate.

All kinds of toads prefer habitats of stagnant water, which they are reluctant to leave. The fire-bellied toad lives primarily in a continental climate in standing water or calmer backwaters of rivers or ponds. The species can also be found in flood pools and in floodplains. The yellow-bellied species typically live at higher altitude, where they are primarily found in small bodies of water like ponds or water-filled ruts, often near small mountain streams. The Asian species also live in small bodies of water and can live at altitudes of over 3000 meters.

==Captivity==
Several species in the genus &quot;Bombina&quot;, particularly &quot;B. orientalis&quot;, &quot;B bombina&quot;, and &quot;B. variegata&quot;, are commonly kept as exotic pets and are readily available in pet stores. In captivity, they are easily maintained in vivaria, and when provided with proper food and environmental conditions, often prove to be robust, flamboyant, and long-lived amphibians. Captive fire-bellied toads can live from 3–10 years and some captive specimens have reached over 20 years.

In captivity, they eat a wide variety of food, including crickets, moths, minnows, blood worms and pinkie mice, though some frogs cannot handle certain foods, due to their size. They can sometimes act very aggressively against each other, particularly males. They have a ferocious appetite. Due to this, its best to monitor their food intake to ensure they&#x27;re not over eating.

Fire-bellied toads breed extremely easily in captivity. Pet owners can expect to hear their mating calls largely starting in May and continuing to mid-August. Breeding will happen unprovoked by the owner. Younger females will have smaller clutches of around 60 to 80 eggs where older females can lay around 200. Fire-bellied toads bred in captivity will often have darker and less vibrant coloration having a more orange underside. Wild caught specimens tend to be brighter and have deeper red stomachs.

Fire-bellied toads are easy to raise and handle in solitude. This makes them advantageous to study in various sciences.

==Toxicity==
Fire-bellied toads secrete bombesin and 5-hydroxytryptamine, which cause irritation to the skin and eyes. Most reported exposures are of young children, did not result in major clinical effects, and were treated by rinsing.

<doc id="976935" wikidata="Q2996293" url="?curid=976935" title="The President Wore Pearls">
<text>&quot;The President Wore Pearls&quot; is the third episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 16, 2003. The episode was written by Dana Gould and directed by Mike B. Anderson.

In this episode, Lisa is elected student body president, but she strikes with the students when the faculty try to corrupt her to allow budget cuts. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music by Alf Clausen And Lyrics by Dana Gould. The episode guest stars documentary filmmaker Michael Moore as himself and received positive reviews.

==Plot==

Springfield Elementary School holds a casino night as a fundraiser, hosted by student body president Martin Prince. Homer wins big, but when Martin says his winnings can only be redeemed for cafeteria scrip and not real money, the angry casino patrons riot. After the chaos has cleared, Principal Skinner tells Martin he must resign as the president. An election for a new president is announced and Lisa signs up. However, initially popular Nelson Muntz is favored to win, providing students (and some teachers) with answer keys to tests. During a debate in the school auditorium, she sings a song (&quot;Vote For a Winner&quot;, a parody of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;) about how she will fight for student rights, winning them over.

Lisa easily wins the election. Worried by her determination and popularity, the faculty discusses how to control her. Following Mrs. Krabappel&#x27;s suggestion that a woman&#x27;s weakness is vanity, they sing another song (&quot;I Am Their Queen&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Rainbow High&quot;) and make Lisa over into a fashionable Eva Perón lookalike. She is initially resistant, but gives in since she reasons she will still be able to fight for the kids. The students love the new Lisa more than ever, but the faculty uses her as a scapegoat for dropping music, gym, and art from the curriculum to save on the budget, getting her to sign the paperwork without looking at it in exchange for a skeleton key to the school. Facing an outraged student body, Lisa resigns as president, goes back to her old red dress and spiky hair, and leads the students into a strike.

Filmmaker Michael Moore shows up to take their side, stating that children who do not receive music, gym and art are more likely to become unemployed and end up in one of his movies. The police arrive at the school, but Lisa convinces them to take their side too. Realizing there is no other way out of the crippling strike other than disposing of Lisa, Skinner has her transferred to a school for the &quot;Academically Gifted and Troublesome&quot;. As her bus departs, her classmates and the rest of Springfield are saddened, but she reassures them by telling them that &quot;[they] can still reach [her] via email (&quot;Smart Girl Six Three&quot;, a parody of &quot;Eva&#x27;s Final Broadcast&quot;).

Just as Lisa arrives at her new school, Homer pulls up and refuses to let her attend, not wanting to deal with the extra driving time. Springfield Elementary is eventually able to restore music, art and gym by cancelling flu shots and selling loose cigarettes. As an endnote, the writers say that at the advice of their lawyers, they have absolutely no knowledge about a musical based on the life of Eva Perón.

== Production ==
The idea for the episode was devised by Al Jean, who was motivated by his love of theater. He regarded &quot;Evita&quot; as a great political musical, and stated that &quot;[he] just always thought that it was one of the most brilliant things ever, and to have Lisa do that was the genesis of this episode.&quot; Although Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, had originally assumed that the central conceit of the episode was intended as a political satire, Al Jean clarified in the commentary track that he had no political motivation and just wanted to &quot;get Lisa singing&quot;.
Jean also credits himself with the idea of inviting Michael Moore to make a guest appearance. He cites his love of &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; (which he says &quot;really captured the whole way [he] felt growing up [in Detroit]&quot;) as a contributing factor, but ultimately the deciding factor was hearing Moore&#x27;s acceptance speech for Best Documentary Feature during the 75th Academy Awards, during which he publicly denounced George W. Bush. Jean notes that “the staff is full of fans”, so the idea was met with near-unanimous enthusiasm.

Moore quickly accepted the offer without even knowing what his role in the episode was going to be, stating that not only had he been watching &quot;The Simpsons&quot; since its conception as a series of shorts on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, he had been a fan of Matt Groening&#x27;s work since the early 80s, and used to run Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strips in an alternative newspaper that he operated from Flint, Michigan. He appreciated that the episode focused on the elimination of art programs in public schools, and enjoyed being called a &quot;professional buttinski&quot; by Kent Brockman.
The musical numbers were composed by Alf Clausen, the show&#x27;s primary composer from 1990 until 2017, and although episode writer Dana Gould is credited as the sole lyricist, Al Jean clarified in the commentary track that the lyrics were a collaborative effort between several &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers. Some time prior to the episode&#x27;s conception, Jean suggested that, due to a “significant royalty [for] having songs in an episode”, any lyrics written by the writing staff for use in a &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode should be credited to whoever originally wrote the episode in order to prevent potential arguments over who should be credited and who should receive the royalties. Although the songs originally pitched were more faithful to the melodies of the &quot;Evita&quot; songs they were based on, the show was forced to modify the melodies for legal reasons. A medley of the songs featured in the episode was included in the 2007 compilation album &quot;The Simpsons: Testify&quot;.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode was watched by 12.74 million viewers, which was the 25th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said the episode was &quot;a generally solid show&quot; and was able to integrate the songs well into the episode.

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Brendan Dando and Guy Davis liked the music but did not like the rest of the story. They also did not like Homer’s role in the episode.

In 2007, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called &quot;The President Wore Pearls&quot; the tenth best episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the most recent episode on the list. John Orvted said, &quot;It may seem ludicrous to include anything later than Season 8 in this list, but this one is brilliant. The musical numbers are astoundingly good, and Lisa&#x27;s comeuppance is so well constructed it harkens back to the golden years of the show (Seasons 3 through 8).&quot; In 2019, &quot;Time&quot; ranked the episode fourth in its list of 10 best &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes picked by &quot;Simpsons&quot; experts.

In 2017, Michael Cavna of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named &quot;Vote for a Winner&quot; as one of the 12 best songs by Alf Clausen.

In 2023, Tony Sokol of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; named the episode the sixth best episode of the 2000s, highlighting the music and the character study of Lisa.

===Awards and nominations===
Alf Clausen and Dana Gould were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics at the 56th Primetime Emmy Awards for the first song in the episode, &quot;Vote for a Winner&quot;, but lost to &quot;Because You Are Beautiful&quot; from &quot;Until the Violence Stops&quot;.

<text>A motorhome (or coach) is a type of self-propelled recreational vehicle (RV) which is as the name suggests, like a home on wheels.

==Features==

Motorhomes usually have sleeping spaces for two to eight people. Each sleeping space is either fixed or converted from another part of the motorhome&#x27;s interior, usually a fold-out sofa. A kitchenette area contains cooking equipment. The type of equipment included differs depending on the motorhome make and model, but generally a kitchenette has a stovetop, oven, refrigerator, and sink. More luxury models may also provide a microwave. A small bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet is usually also located in the motorhome. On smaller motorhomes, the toilet may be of the &quot;cassette toilet&quot; type, which is a kind of portable toilet or container-based toilet. The toilet sometimes swivels to provide extra room and can be accessed from outside the motorhome for easy emptying. Larger motorhomes usually have a separate shower cubicle.

A motorhome also has a cab area with a driver and passenger seat. These seats often swivel to become part of the living space. A dinette area provides a table and seating space typically used for eating meals. A lounge may also be included, consisting of either a U-shaped sofa located in the rear of the motorhome or a side lounge.

===Variations in terminology===
In the United Kingdom and the United States, the word &quot;motorhome&quot; is commonly used. On occasion, other synonyms are used, such as &quot;motor home&quot; and &quot;motor caravan&quot;.

In Germany, a motorhome is referred to as a &quot;Wohnmobil&quot;. In Sweden, the term &quot;husbil&quot; means motorhome. In France, a motorhome is called a &quot;camping-car&quot;. In Italy, the term &quot;camper&quot; is used to mean motorhome in general, and the term &quot;motorhome&quot; refers to Class A motorhomes in particular. Spain and Portugal use &quot;auto caravana&quot; or &quot;auto-caravana&quot;. In the Netherlands and in Poland, the term &quot;camper&quot; is used.

In Australia and New Zealand, the term &quot;campervan&quot; is frequently used for smaller vans, either with a low top or high top that do not have a toilet and shower. In New Zealand, the term &quot;housebus&quot; is frequently used for larger motorhomes.

In some countries, the proprietary name Winnebago has been largely genericised to refer to any motorhome.

==History==
The origins of the motorhome date back to 1910, when the Pierce-Arrow motor company introduced the Touring Landau model at the Madison Square Garden auto show. The Pierce-Arrow&#x27;s entry was specialized for the camper in mind—providing cargo compartments for camping equipment and even an on-board toilet. In the 1920s, individual builders and manufactures began to convert panel trucks and buses to be used for camping. Designers patterned these &quot;housecars&quot; after airplanes, boats, and buses. 

RV production was halted during World War Two and would not resume for the domestic market until the 1950s. When production did begin again, designers began grafting trailer bodies onto truck or bus chassis.

Raymond Frank gave these housecars their contemporary name of “motorhome&quot;. Following a pattern common in RV history, in 1958 Frank designed and built his first motorhome so his family could take vacations to Florida and the mid-west; it was long and mounted on a Dodge chassis. Soon afterwards, other campers took an interest in the design and asked Frank to build them one too. By 1960, the Franks had sold seven motorhomes, and decided to open Frank Motor Homes, Inc. the next year. With the stylish fiberglass construction and contemporary color palette, the Frank motorhomes became an acceptable option for 1960s suburbanites who wanted an RV but scoffed at the travel trailer.

Soon other firms began to manufacture these mainstream motorhomes. In 1958, one of the most recognizable names in motorhomes was launched—Winnebago. Under the direction of John Hanson, Winnebago began to produce nearly all of their motorhomes&#x27; components other than the chassis. In ten years, Winnebago had grown from 415 employees to 1,252 in 1969 with over $3 million in sales. While Winnebago was the market leader, other companies were also growing. In 1969 a total of 23,100 motorhomes were sold. While the gas crunch of the 1970s drove many manufacturers out of business—including Frank Motorhomes (then known as Travco)—today, the motorhome market continues to be strong. In 2014, 43,900 motorhomes were sold in the United States.

==Categories==
Motorhomes can be roughly categorized into three categories:
; Class A (also known as &quot;integrated&quot;)
: A Class A motorhome often has a reputation for being the most luxurious and expensive of vehicles. It has a solid body with the driving area integrated into the standard living accommodation. This style of motorhome will have a large and expansive front window which offers a good view of the road and surrounding landscape. Berths convert from lounge or dinette areas.

; Class B (also known as &quot;semi-integrated&quot;)
: A Class B motorhome is also referred to as a low profile or semi-integrated motorhome. It is built in the same way as a Class C motorhome, except no berths are provided over the cab area. As a result, the overall height of this motorhome is lower than a Class C. There is usually a fixed double bed in the rear of the vehicle.

; Class C (also known as &quot;alcove&quot;)
: A Class C motorhome may also be known as coach built. It has a trailer- or caravan-style body which is mounted onto a van or truck chassis. There is usually a double berth over the driving cab. Ford and Fiat manufacture the majority of these motorhome chasses in Europe.

==Layouts==

There are many different motorhome layouts available with each manufacturer offering a range of options. One layout innovation that started in 1999 was the development of a slide out or slide room. As seen on the floor plan of the Thor Motor Coach, a slide out is an area that increases the square footage living space of the motorhome. These slide out(s) extend to allow for more living space while parked and retract while driving. As with most innovations, the original slide outs were considered a luxury item, whereas they are now standard on most of today&#x27;s motorhomes.

<doc id="976945" wikidata="Q255306" url="?curid=976945" title="Japanese battleship Kongō">
<text>was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II. She was the first battlecruiser of the , among the most heavily armed ships in any navy when built. Her designer was the British naval engineer George Thurston, and she was laid down in 1911 at Barrow-in-Furness in Britain by Vickers Shipbuilding Company. &quot;Kongō&quot; was the last Japanese capital ship constructed outside Japan. She was formally commissioned in 1913, and patrolled off the Chinese coast during World War I.

&quot;Kongō&quot; underwent two major reconstructions. Beginning in 1929, the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt her as a battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities. In 1935, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, her speed was increased, and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan&#x27;s growing carrier fleet, &quot;Kongō&quot; was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, &quot;Kongō&quot; operated off the coast of mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941. In 1942, she sailed as part of the Southern Force in preparation for the Battle of Singapore.

&quot;Kongō&quot; fought in many major naval actions of the Pacific War during World War II. She covered the Japanese Army&#x27;s amphibious landings in British Malaya (part of present-day Malaysia) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in 1942, before engaging American forces at the Battle of Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign. Throughout 1943, &quot;Kongō&quot; primarily remained at Truk Lagoon in the Caroline Islands, Kure Naval Base (near Hiroshima), Sasebo Naval Base (near Nagasaki), and Lingga Roads, and deployed several times in response to American aircraft carrier air raids on Japanese island bases scattered across the Pacific. &quot;Kongō&quot; participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944 (22–23 October), engaging and sinking American vessels in the latter. &quot;Kongō&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine while transiting the Formosa Strait on 21 November 1944. She was the only Japanese battleship sunk by a submarine in the Second World War.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Kongō&quot; was the first of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers, which were almost as large, costly and well-armed as battleships, but which traded off armored protection for higher speeds. These were designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston and were ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of in 1908. These four battlecruisers of the &quot;Kongō&quot; class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the battlecruisers of the other major naval powers at the time, and they have been called the battlecruiser versions of the British (formerly Turkish) battleship . Their heavy armament of 14-inch naval guns and their armor protection (which took up about 23.3% of their approximately 30,000-ton displacements in 1913) were greatly superior to those of any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time.

The keel of &quot;Kongō&quot; was laid down at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 January 1911. Under Japan&#x27;s contract with Vickers, the first vessel of the class was constructed in the United Kingdom, with the remainder built in Japan. &quot;Kongō&quot; was launched on 18 May 1912, and then transferred to the dockyards of Portsmouth, England, where her fitting-out began in mid-1912. All parts used in her construction were manufactured in the U.K. &quot;Kongō&quot; was completed on 16 April 1913.

===Siemens-Vickers Scandal===

In January 1914, a telegram leaked from Siemens&#x27; Tokyo office to Reuters along with further reporting by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; led to an investigation by Japanese authorities which revealed a pattern of bribery and kickbacks by German and English armaments corporations. Siemens had been paying senior Japanese officials a secret 15% kickback, until Vickers had outbid them by offering 25%. Vickers had paid 210,000 yen to Admiral Fuji of the Imperial Japanese Navy procurement in 1911 and 1912, and 40,000 yen to Vice Admiral Matsumoto Kazu, related to obtaining the contract for building &quot;Kongō&quot;. Kazu was court-martialed in May 1914, fined 400,000 yen and sentenced to 3 years in prison. As a result of the Siemens-Vickers Scandal revolving around the contracts of building &quot;Kongō&quot;, the government of Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohyōe resigned March 23, 1914. Senior executives of the Mitsui corporation, Japanese partners of Vickers, also resigned.

===Armament===
Originally, &quot;Kongō&quot;″s main battery was designed to consist of ten 12-inch (305 mm) main guns. However, her builders, Vickers, convinced the Japanese to go with a larger weapon after &quot;Kongō&quot; was laid down. Because of this, &quot;Kongō&#x27;s&quot; main armament as built consisted of eight Vickers 14 inch (356 mm)/45 naval gun heavy-caliber main naval guns in four twin turrets (two forward and two aft), making her the most powerfully armed capital ship when she was commissioned. The turrets were noted by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence to be &quot;similar to the British 15-inch turrets&quot;, with improvements made in flash-tightness. Each of her main guns could fire high explosive or armor-piercing shells at a rate of about two shells per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;14/45&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the Japanese doctrine of deploying more powerful vessels before their opponents, &quot;Kongō&quot; and her sister ships were the first vessels in the world equipped with guns. Her main guns carried ammunition for 90 shots, and they had an approximate barrel lifetime of 250 to 280 shots. In 1941, separate dyes were introduced for the armor-piercing shells of the four &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battleships to assist with targeting, with &quot;Kongō&quot;″s armor-piercing shells using red dye.

The secondary battery of &quot;Kongō&quot; originally consisted of sixteen 50 calibre guns in single casemates located amidships (&quot;50 calibre&quot; means that the lengths of the guns were 50 times their bore, or 300 inches), eight guns, and eight submerged torpedo tubes. Her six-inch naval guns could fire five to six rounds per minute, with a barrel lifetime of about 500 rounds. The 6-inch/50-calibre gun was capable of firing both antiaircraft and antiship shells, though the positioning of these guns on &quot;Kongō&quot; made antiaircraft firing mostly impractical. During her second reconstruction, the older three-inch guns were removed and then replaced with eight 5-inch (127 mm) 40-calibre dual purpose guns. These guns could fire from eight to 14 rounds per minute, with a barrel lifetime of between 800 and 1,500 rounds. Of &quot;Kongō&quot;″s guns, the 5-inch guns had the widest variety of shell types: antiaircraft, antiship, and illumination shells. &quot;Kongō&quot; was also armed with many antiaircraft machine guns. By October 1944, &quot;Kongō&quot;″s secondary armament was reconfigured to eight guns, eight guns, and 122 Type 96 antiaircraft rapid-fire cannons.

=== Armor ===
Being a battlecruiser, &quot;Kongō&#x27;s&quot; armor was fairly thin. She was equipped with a 6- to 8-inch (152–203 mm) main belt. &quot;Kongō&quot; deck armor consisted of armor plating ranging from 1-inch (25 mm), 1.5-inches (38 mm), to 2.75-inches (7 cm), depending on the area. She was equipped with nine-inch (229 mm) barbette armor protecting the ammunition to her main guns, as well as turret armor consisting of 10-inch (254 mm) turret faces, and 9-inch (229 mm) plating over the sides and rear.

==Service history==

===1913–1929: Battlecruiser===
On 16 August 1913, &quot;Kongō&quot; was completed and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy (I.J.N.). Twelve days later, she departed from Portsmouth headed for Japan. She was docked at Singapore from 20 to 27 October, before arriving at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 5 November, where she was placed in First Reserve. In January 1914, she docked at Kure Naval Base for armament checks. On 3 August 1914, the German Empire declared war on France and then invaded via Belgium, sparking the beginning of World War I in the West. Twelve days later, Japan issued a warning to Kaiser Wilhelm II of the German Empire, ordering him to withdraw the German troops from their base at Qingdao, China. When the German Empire did not respond, Japan declared war on Germany on 23 August, occupying the former German possessions in the Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, Marshall Islands, and Marianas Islands. &quot;Kongō&quot; was quickly deployed towards the Central Pacific to patrol the sea lines of communication of the German Empire. &quot;Kongō&quot; returned to the port of Yokosuka, Japan, on 12 September, and one month later, she was assigned to the First Battleship Division. In October, &quot;Kongō&quot; and her new sister ship sortied off the Chinese coast in support of Japanese army units during the Siege of Tsingtao. Then &quot;Kongō&quot; returned to Sasebo Naval Base for upgrades to her searchlights. On 3 October 1915, &quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Hiei&quot; participated in the sinking of the old as a practice target. She was a Russian pre-dreadnought that had been captured in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War that had next served as an I.J.N. warship. With the defeat of the German East Asia Squadron by the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, there was little or no need for I.J.N. operations in the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Kongō&quot; spent the rest of World War I either based at Sasebo or on patrol off the coast of China. In December 1918, following the end of the hostilities of World War I, &quot;Kongō&quot; was placed in &quot;Second Reserve&quot;. In April 1919, she was fitted with a new seawater flooding system for her ammunition magazines.

With the conclusion of World War I, and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty on 6 February 1922, the size of the I.J.N. was significantly limited, with a ratio of 5:5:3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Japanese Empire, since the latter was responsible for only one ocean, rather than the two of the other countries, and fewer warships for France and Italy. This Treaty also banned the signatories from building any new capital ships until 1931, with no capital ship permitted to exceed in displacement. Provided that new additions did not exceed 3,000 tons of displacement, the existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved anti-torpedo bulges and armored main decks. By the time that the Washington Naval Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan, only three classes of World War I type capital ships remained active: the s, the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers, and the s.

In April 1923, &quot;Kongō&quot; gave transportation to Crown Prince Hirohito during his official visit to the Japanese possession of Taiwan. On 14 June 1924, she collided with &quot;Submarine No. 62&quot; during maneuvers. In November 1924, &quot;Kongō&quot; docked at Yokosuka, where modifications were made to her main armament, increasing the elevation of her main guns and improving her fire-control systems. In 1927, &quot;Kongō&quot; underwent major modifications to her superstructure, rebuilding it into the pagoda mast style to accommodate the growing number of fire-control systems for her main guns. In May 1928, her steering equipment was upgraded, before she was placed in reserve in preparation for major modifications and reconstruction in 1929–31.

===1929–1935: Reconstruction into battleship===

Prohibited by the Washington Treaty from constructing new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading their World War I-era battleships and battlecruisers. Beginning in September 1929, &quot;Kongō&quot; underwent extensive modernization and modification in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, &quot;Kongō&quot;″s horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull given increased torpedo protection. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes, though no aircraft catapults were fitted. To increase her speed and power, all 36 of her Yarrow boilers were removed, and then replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. &quot;Kongō&quot;″s forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313 long tons, directly violating the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. In March 1931, &quot;Kongō&quot;—now capable of a speed of —was reclassified as a battleship.

On 22 April 1930, Japan signed the London Naval Treaty, placing further restrictions on the signatories&#x27; naval forces. Several of her older battleships were scrapped, and no new capital ships were built as replacements. After minor fitting-out work, &quot;Kongō&quot;″s reconstruction begun in September 1929 and was declared complete on 31 March 1931. On 1 December 1931, two months after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, &quot;Kongō&quot; was assigned to the First Battleship Division and also designated the flagship of the Combined Fleet. Additional rangefinders and searchlights were fitted to her superstructure in January 1932, and Captain Nobutake Kondō assumed command of the vessel in December. In 1933, aircraft catapults were fitted between the two rear turrets.

On 25 February 1933, following a report by the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan&#x27;s invasion of China had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the judgement of this organization, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations on the same day. Japan also immediately withdrew from the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, thus removing all restrictions on the numbers and sizes of her capital warships. In November 1934, &quot;Kongō&quot; was placed in Second Reserve in preparation for further modifications. On 10 January 1935, &quot;Kongō&quot; was toured by the Nazi German naval attaché to Japan, Captain Paul Wenneker, as part of a gunnery demonstration.

===1935–1941: Fast battleship===
On 1 June 1935, &quot;Kongō&quot; was dry-docked at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in preparation for upgrades that would enable her to escort Japan&#x27;s growing fleet of aircraft carriers. Her stern was lengthened by to improve her fineness ratio and her 16 older boilers were removed and then replaced with 11 oil-fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines. In addition, her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan&#x27;s pagoda mast style of forward superstructure, and catapults were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and spotter floatplanes.

&quot;Kongō&quot;″s armor was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of eight inches (up from varying thicknesses of six to eight inches), and also diagonal bulkheads of depths ranging from were added to reinforce the main armored belt. The turret armor was strengthened to , while were added to portions of the deck armor. &quot;Kongō&quot;″s ammunition magazine protection was also strengthened to . This reconstruction was finished on 8 January 1937. Capable of greater than , despite the significant increase in her hull displacement, &quot;Kongō&quot; was now reclassified as a fast battleship. Despite this reclassification, however, &quot;Kongō&quot; could still very much be considered a battlecruiser in nature.

In February 1937, &quot;Kongō&quot; was assigned to the Sasebo Naval District, and in December she was placed under the command of Takeo Kurita in the Third Battleship Division. In April 1938, two float planes from &quot;Kongō&quot; bombed the Chinese city of Fuzhou during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Throughout 1938 and 1939, &quot;Kongō&quot; steamed off the Chinese coast in support of Japanese Army operations during the war. In November 1939, Captain Raizo Tanaka assumed command of &quot;Kongō&quot;. From November 1940 to April 1941, additional armor was added to &quot;Kongō&quot;″s armament barbettes and ammunition tubes, while ventilation and firefighting equipment was also improved. In August 1941, she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa alongside her fully modified sister warships &quot;Hiei&quot;, and the .

===1942: Pacific War service===
&quot;Kongō&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; departed from the Hashirajima fleet anchorage on 29 November 1941 to begin the War in the Pacific as part of the Southern (Malay) Force&#x27;s Main Body, under the overall command of Vice-Admiral Nobutake Kondō. On 4 December 1941, the Main Body arrived off the coast of southern Thailand and northern Malaya in preparation for the invasion of Thailand and the Malayan Peninsula four days later. When Britain&#x27;s &quot;Force Z&quot;—consisting of the battleship and the battlecruiser —was quickly defeated by Japan&#x27;s land-based aircraft from southern Vietnam, &quot;Kongō&quot;″s battlegroup withdrew from Malayan waters. This battlegroup subsequently sortied from Indochina for three days in mid-December to protect a reinforcement convoy traveling to Malaya, and again on 18 December to cover the Japanese Army&#x27;s landing at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, in the Philippines. The Main Body departed Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 23 December bound for Taiwan, arriving two days later. In January 1942, &quot;Kongō&quot; and the heavy cruisers and provided distant cover for air attacks on Ambon Island.

On 21 February, &quot;Kongō&quot; was joined by &quot;Haruna&quot;, four fast aircraft carriers, five heavy cruisers and numerous support ships in preparation for &quot;Operation J&quot;, Japan&#x27;s invasion of the Dutch East Indies. On 25 February, the Third Battleship Division provided cover for air attacks on the Island of Java. &quot;Kongō&quot; bombarded Christmas Island off the western coast of Australia on 7 March 1942, and then she returned to Staring-baai for 15 days of standby alert. In April 1942, &quot;Kongō&quot; joined five fleet carriers in attacks on Colombo and Trincomalee on Ceylon. Following the destruction of the British heavy cruisers and on 5 April 1942, this naval task force moved southwest to locate the remainder of the British Eastern Fleet, then under the command of Admiral James Somerville. On 9 April, one of &quot;Haruna&quot;″s reconnaissance seaplanes spotted the aircraft carrier south of Trincomalee. On the same day, Japanese air attacks sank the carrier, and &quot;Kongō&quot; was attacked but missed by nine British medium bombers. Having crippled the offensive capability of Britain&#x27;s Eastern Fleet, the Third Battleship Division returned to Japan. &quot;Kongō&quot; reached Sasebo on 22 April. From 23 April to 2 May, &quot;Kongō&quot; was drydocked for reconfiguration of her antiaircraft armament.

On 27 May 1942, &quot;Kongō&quot; sortied with &quot;Hiei&quot; and the heavy cruisers &quot;Atago&quot;, , , and as part of Admiral Nobutake Kondō&#x27;s invasion force during the Battle of Midway. Following the disastrous loss of four of the Combined Fleet&#x27;s fast carriers on 4 June 1942, Kondō&#x27;s force withdrew to Japan. On 14 July she was assigned as the flagship of the restructured Third Battleship Division. In August, &quot;Kongō&quot; was drydocked at Kure to receive surface-detection radar and additional range finders. In September, &quot;Kongō&quot; embarked with &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Haruna&quot;, &quot;Kirishima&quot;, three carriers, and numerous smaller warships in response to the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. On 20 September, this task force was ordered to return to the Truk Naval Base in the Central Pacific north of the equator.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce its troops on Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent &quot;Haruna&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot;, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard the American air base at Henderson Field. Because of their high speeds, these two battleships could bombard the airfield and then withdraw before being subjected to air attack from either land-based warplanes or American aircraft carriers. On the night of 13–14 October, these two battleships shelled the area of Henderson Field from a distance of about , firing 973 14-inch high-explosive shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all of the U.S. Marines&#x27; aviation fuel, destroyed or damaged 48 of the Marines&#x27; 90 warplanes, and killed 41 Marines. A large Japanese troop and supply convoy reached Guadalcanal on the next day.

During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942, &quot;Kongō&quot; was attacked by four Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, but she received no hits. In mid-November, this battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the unsuccessful mission by the I.J.N. to bombard Henderson Field again and to deliver more Army reinforcements to Guadalcanal. On 15 November 1942, following the Japanese defeat and the sinking of &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Third Battleship Division returned to Truk, where it remained for the rest of 1942.

===1943: Movement between bases===
Throughout 1943, &quot;Kongō&quot; engaged no enemy targets. In late January 1943, she participated in &quot;Operation Ke&quot; as part of a diversionary and distant covering force to support I.J.N. destroyers that were evacuating Army troops from Guadalcanal. From 15 February through 20 February 1943, the Third Battleship Division was transferred from Truk to the Kure Naval Base. On 27 February, &quot;Kongō&quot; was drydocked to receive upgrades to her antiaircraft armament, with the additions of two triple 25 mm gun mounts and the removal of two of her 6-inch turrets, while additional concrete protection was added near her steering gear. On 17 May 1943, in response to the U.S. Army&#x27;s invasion of Attu Island, &quot;Kongō&quot; sortied alongside the battleship , the Third Battleship Division, two fleet carriers, two cruisers, and nine destroyers. Three days later, the American submarine spotted this naval task force, but she was unable to attack it. On 22 May 1943, the task force arrived in Yokosuka, where it was joined by an additional three fleet carriers and two light cruisers. This force was disbanded when Attu fell to the U.S. Army before the necessary preparations for a counterattack had been finished.

On 17 October 1943, &quot;Kongō&quot; again left Truk as part of a larger task force consisting of five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and numerous destroyers. These sortied in response to U.S. Navy air raids on Wake Island. No contact between the two forces was made, and the Japanese task force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. She soon left Truk for home waters, and on 16 December 1943, &quot;Kongō&quot; arrived at Sasebo for refits and training in the Inland Sea.

===1944: Combat and loss===
In January 1944, &quot;Kongō&quot; was dry-docked for a reconfiguration of her anti-aircraft suite. Four 6-inch guns and a pair of twin 25 mm mounts were removed and replaced with six twin 5-inch guns and four triple 25 mm mounts. The Third Battleship Division departed from Kure on 8 March 1944. Arriving at Lingga on 14 March 1944, the division remained for training until 11 May 1944. On 11 May 1944, &quot;Kongō&quot; and Admiral Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet departed from Lingga bound for Tawitawi, where they were joined by Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s &quot;Force C&quot;. On 13 June, Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet departed from Tawitawi bound for the Mariana Islands. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Kongō&quot; escorted Japanese fast carriers, and remained undamaged in counterattacks from US carrier aircraft on 20 June. When she returned to Japan, 13 triple and 40 single 25-mm mounts were added to her anti-aircraft armament, for a total of over 100 mounts. In August, two more 6-inch guns were removed and another eighteen single mounts installed.

=== Battle of Leyte Gulf ===
In October 1944, &quot;Kongō&quot; departed from Lingga in preparation for &quot;Operation Sho-1&quot;, Japan&#x27;s counterattack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval engagement in history. On 24 October, &quot;Kongō&quot; was undamaged by several near misses from American carrier aircraft in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. On 25 October, during the Battle off Samar, &quot;Kongō&quot;—as part of Admiral Kurita&#x27;s Centre Force—engaged the US 7th Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, a battlegroup of escort carriers and destroyers. She targeted various destroyers, but to no avail in the beginning parts of the battle, before scoring a hit with her main battery to the bridge of the destroyer .

It was previously believed that &quot;Kongō&quot; scored three hits with her 14-inch (356 mm) guns on the destroyer shortly after the valiant destroyer crippled the heavy cruiser , severe damage that cut &quot;Johnston&#x27;s&quot; speed to 17 knots and took out all but two of her 5-inch guns, and according to the state of her wreck, split her in two and sank her a couple of hours later while under fire from a Japanese destroyer line. However, Japanese records display that &quot;Kongō&quot; was blinded by a rain squall and unable to engage enemy ships at the time &quot;Johnston&quot; was hit, but fellow battleship claimed numerous hits with both her main and secondary battery on a US &quot;cruiser&quot; at the exact moment &quot;Johnston&quot; was hit by what is now commonly accepted as three 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells from &quot;Yamato&quot;, as well as three hits from &quot;Yamato&#x27;s&quot; 6.1-inch (155 mm) secondary guns. &quot;Kongō&quot; in all reality failed to score a single hit on &quot;Johnston&quot; and played no role in her crippling and sinking.

&quot;Kongō&quot; then targeted the escort carrier , claiming a hit with her main battery. However, said hit was also claimed by the aforementioned battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, which is widely agreed upon to have scored the hit due to having the shorter range and the correct firing angle, and indeed, &quot;Yamato&quot; would be awarded credit for the hit by Japanese admiralty. She then scored numerous hits on &quot;Hoel&quot; and the destroyer , heavily contributing to the former&#x27;s sinking. At 09:12, she sank the destroyer escort . After a fierce defensive action by the American ships, which sank three Japanese heavy cruisers, Admiral Kurita elected to withdraw, ending the battle. While retreating, &quot;Kongō&quot; suffered damage from five near misses from attacking aircraft. The fleet arrived at Brunei on 28 October.

=== Sinking ===
On 16 November, following a US air raid on Brunei, &quot;Kongō&quot;, along with , and the rest of the First Fleet, departed from Brunei bound for Kure in preparation for a major reorganization of the fleet and battle repairs. On 20 November, they entered the Formosa Strait. Shortly after midnight on 21 November, the submarine made radar contact with the fleet at . Maneuvering into position at 02:45, &quot;Sealion&quot; fired six bow torpedoes at &quot;Kongō&quot; followed by three stern torpedoes at &quot;Nagato&quot; fifteen minutes later. One minute after the first salvo was launched, two of the torpedoes were seen to hit &quot;Kongō&quot; on the port side, while a third sank the destroyer with all hands. The torpedoes flooded two of &quot;Kongō&quot;″s boiler rooms, but she was still able to make . By 05:00, she had slowed to and was given permission to break off from the fleet and head to the port of Keelung in Formosa along with the destroyers and as escort. Within fifteen minutes of detaching from the main force, &quot;Kongō&quot; was listing 45 degrees and flooding uncontrollably. At 5:18 the ship lost all power and the order was given to abandon ship. At 5:24, while the evacuation was under way, the forward 14-inch magazine exploded, and the broken ship sank quickly, with the loss of over 1,200 of her crew, including the commander of the Third Battleship Division and her captain.

&quot;Kongō&quot; is believed to have sunk in of water approximately northwest of Keelung. She was one of only three British-built battleships sunk by submarine attack during World War II. The other two were the British and the .

As of August 2024, &quot;Kongō&quot; is the only Japanese battleship from World War II whose wreck has not been located or surveyed.

<text>Holden is a lunar impact crater attached to the southeast rim of the much larger crater Vendelinus. The crater rim is impacted by a craterlet on the north-northwest, and it possesses a along the northeast interior wall. The floor of the crater is flat with no central peak. There is a small crater on the floor just to the south of the midpoint. It is named after Edward Singleton Holden. A crater with the same name exists on Mars.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Holden.

<doc id="976963" wikidata="Q471491" url="?curid=976963" title="Chris Drury">
<text>Christopher Ellis Drury (born August 20, 1976) is an American professional ice hockey executive and former player. He has served as the president and general manager for the New York Rangers since May 5, 2021. He previously served as the general manager of the Rangers American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack.

Drury is a Hobey Baker Award-winner with Boston University, a Calder Memorial Trophy winner with the Colorado Avalanche, a Stanley Cup champion with the Avalanche, a two-time Olympic silver medalist with the United States and a former captain of the Buffalo Sabres and New York Rangers. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2015. As a child, he also won the Little League Baseball World Series Championship with his hometown team from Trumbull, Connecticut.

==Early life==
Drury excelled at a variety of sports as a child, including hockey and baseball. Playing for his hometown baseball team from Trumbull, Drury pitched a complete game, five-hitter and drove in two runs to win the 1989 Little League World Series championship game against Chinese Taipei. Two months later, Drury threw out the ceremonial first pitch in game two of the 1989 World Series. He also met President George H. W. Bush and appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in New York City. Drury played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Rye, New York.

Drury played many sports simultaneously; before winning the Little League World Series with Trumbull, he won a national pee wee championship with his hockey team from Bridgeport the same year. Along with his older brother Ted, he attended Fairfield College Preparatory School. He was co-captain of the varsity hockey team in his senior year, receiving Connecticut all-state honors for his efforts on the ice. Chris and Ted are the only players in Fairfield Prep&#x27;s hockey history to have their numbers retired. The number 18, which they both wore, hangs above the school&#x27;s home rink at the Wonderland of Ice in Bridgeport in the old rink, as well as in the lobby outside the locker room complex at Fairfield Prep itself. Chris&#x27; name and number are also painted above the entrance doors to the Classic arena at the same ice rink.

==Playing career==
=== Boston University (1994–1998)===
After graduating from Fairfield College Preparatory School, Drury was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques 72nd overall in the third round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Upon being drafted, he began a four-year career at Boston University (BU). In his freshman year in 1995, he won a national championship with BU. In both 1997 and 1998 he was named Hockey East&#x27;s player of the year and was also named best defensive forward in 1998. In his senior year, he won the Hobey Baker Award as the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA)&#x27;s top ice hockey player after finishing as the runner-up the previous season. Drury was the first BU player to reach 100 career goals and assists, finishing with 113 and 100, respectively. BU won the Beanpot tournament all four years he played for them. On January 15, 2009, well into his NHL career, Drury was named Hockey East&#x27;s Best Defensive Forward, as part of the league&#x27;s 25th Anniversary celebration. Drury was chosen in a vote of Hockey East fans and members of the league&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Committee.

===NHL===
====Colorado Avalanche (1998–2002)==== 
Drury began his NHL career there in 1998–99. Recording 44 points in his first season, Drury was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s top rookie. In so doing, he became the first player in history to have won both the Hobey Baker Award and the Calder Trophy.

After a 65-point season in 2000–01, Drury won the Stanley Cup with the Avalanche, adding 16 points in the playoffs. Drury became a fan favorite with the Avalanche crowd primarily due to his clutch play during playoffs. He had a total of 11 game-winning goals in four straight playoff seasons in Colorado. Avalanche captain Joe Sakic once said of Drury, &quot;You want a goal, you&#x27;re in overtime – you want him.&quot; Because of his penchant for game-winning goals, Drury was often referred to as one of the best clutch players in the NHL.

Although Drury&#x27;s production dipped to 46 points in 2001–02, he was named to the U.S. roster for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Though he did not record any points in the tournament, the Americans surprised many by making it all the way to the final where they lost to Canada. This was the best finish for the United States at the tournament since the 1980 &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;.

====Calgary Flames (2002–2003)====
Before the start of the next season, on October 1, 2002, Drury and Stéphane Yelle were traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Derek Morris, Dean McAmmond and Jeff Shantz. Drury recorded 53 points for the Flames during the year, finishing third in team scoring.

====Buffalo Sabres (2003–2007)====
Drury spent just one season with the Flames before he was traded on July 3, 2003, along with Steve Bégin, to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for former Avalanche teammate Steven Reinprecht and Rhett Warrener. Traded twice in two seasons, Drury was admittedly frustrated. However, Drury regained his form and excelled in Buffalo, serving as co-captain with Daniel Brière from 2005 to his departure via free agency in 2007. With his previous numbers (37 with Colorado and 18 with Calgary) both taken in Buffalo, Drury switched to 23 in honor of his childhood hero, New York Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly.

Drury again represented the United States at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where the Americans finished eighth overall.

After a career-high 37-goal, 69-point campaign in 2006–07, the Sabres made a second consecutive run to the Eastern Conference Finals this time as the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning first seed, where they faced the Ottawa Senators. Proving he could still be a clutch performer, Drury scored two game-winning goals in the first round against the New York Islanders, then scored the game-tying goal in game five of the second round against the New York Rangers with 7.7 seconds left in regulation time. The Sabres won 2–1 in overtime and closed out the series against the Rangers, four games to two. In game four of the conference finals against the Senators, Drury recorded another game-winner to stave off elimination, though the Sabres were eventually defeated four games to one.

====New York Rangers (2007–2011)====
In the off-season, Drury and co-captain Daniel Brière both became unrestricted free agents. While Brière signed with the Philadelphia Flyers, on July 1, 2007, Drury signed a five-year, $35.25 million contract with the New York Rangers. He made his Rangers debut against the Florida Panthers, scoring a goal in a 5–2 win. On February 1, 2008, in a game against the New Jersey Devils, Drury scored an empty net goal on the power play for his 500th career point. He finished his first season with the Rangers with 58 points – third in team scoring. Matched up against New Jersey in the first round, Drury scored the game-winning and series-clinching goal to eliminate the Devils in five games. On October 1, 2008, Drury and the Rangers won the Victoria Cup, defeating Metallurg Magnitogorsk by a score of 4–3.

After the departure of Jaromír Jágr from the Rangers to play in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), Drury was named the 25th captain in Rangers history on October 3, 2008. Drury was only the second American-born captain in team history (the first was Brian Leetch from 1997 to 2000). This made Drury one of four active NHL players at the time to have captained two different NHL teams (the others were Chris Pronger, Joe Thornton and former teammate Adam Foote).

Drury was named to the United States roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Drury, Jamie Langenbrunner and Brian Rafalski were the only members of the 2010 team who had previous Olympic experience. Because of his disappointing play for the Rangers in 2010 (he had spent much of the season on the fourth line, with a pre-Olympics scoring total of 8G-11A-19P and a −14 plus-minus rating), Drury&#x27;s inclusion on the team was questioned by former Olympian Jeremy Roenick, who said the team might be better served by adding either former Rangers teammate Scott Gomez or T. J. Oshie. On February 21, 2010, Drury scored the go-ahead goal to break a 2–2 tie in a critical round-robin game against Canada. The Americans went on to win 5–3. The Americans lost a rematch to the Canadians in the gold medal game and Drury was awarded an Olympic silver medal for the second time.

In February 2011, Drury underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, missing 6 weeks. At the time of the surgery, he missed 33 games during the season. In June 2011, rumors began circulating that the Rangers were looking to negotiate a contract buyout with Drury. However, these rumors were silenced after it was announced Drury may have a degenerative condition in his left knee which would cause him to miss the entire 2011–12 season.

On June 29, 2011, Drury accepted a buy-out of the final year of his contract to become an unrestricted free agent July 1, 2011. Drury would count approximately $3.716 million against the 2011–12 salary cap, and about $1.667 million against the 2012–13 salary cap. On August 19, 2011, Drury retired as a player.

==Management career==
In September 2015, the Rangers named Drury their director of player development. In September 2016, Drury was promoted by the Rangers to assistant general manager. The next season, he was also assigned to be the general manager of their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack.

In March 2019, the Rangers signed Drury to a contract extension as assistant general manager. On February 5, 2021, Drury was promoted to associate general manager. On May 5, 2021, following the sudden dismissal of John Davidson and Jeff Gorton from the team&#x27;s front office, Drury was promoted to President and General Manager of the New York Rangers.

In Chris Drury&#x27;s first offseason as general manager, he made several free agent signings and trades in response to the Tom Wilson incident on May 3, which occurred two days before he took over as general manager. This includes trading for Barclay Goodrow (and later signing him on a six-year deal), signing Patrik Nemeth to a three-year, $7.5 million deal, and signing Ryan Reaves. Although Drury made these signings in response to the Tom Wilson incident, he also faced criticism throughout the offseason, most notably on July 23 when he traded Pavel Buchnevich to the St. Louis Blues for Sammy Blais. His offseason with the Rangers was ranked 23rd by The Athletic, and the Buchnevich trade has been considered as one of the worst trades in franchise history. Despite the Buchnevich trade and criticism for his offseason moves, the Rangers did make the Eastern Conference finals following his trade deadline additions for Andrew Copp, Frank Vatrano, and Justin Braun. Following the season, Drury was named as a finalist for the Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award, an award given to the top NHL general manager, along with former teammate and Colorado Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic and Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Julien BriseBois.

==Personal life==
Drury and his wife Rory have two daughters and a son. The family resides in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Drury&#x27;s older brother, Ted, played professional hockey in the NHL for six different teams between 1989 and 2001. His nephew, Jack, currently plays professional hockey for the Colorado Avalanche.

In the late 2000s, Drury, along with partners Ken Martin, Paul Coniglio, and Cody Lee, purchased Colony Grill in Stamford, Connecticut, a pizza tavern established in 1935. Since the purchase, the group has opened four more locations throughout southwestern Connecticut and New York, including Fairfield, Connecticut, near where Drury played high school hockey at Fairfield Prep. Locations have also been opened in the Tampa Bay area of Florida, Maryland, and Virginia.

<doc id="976964" wikidata="Q2221926" url="?curid=976964" title="Stolypin reform">
<text>The Stolypin agrarian reforms were a series of changes to Imperial Russia&#x27;s agricultural sector instituted during the tenure of Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin. Most, if not all, of these reforms were based on recommendations from a committee known as the &quot;Needs of Agricultural Industry Special Conference,&quot; which was held in Russia between 1901 and 1903 during the tenure of Minister of Finance Sergei Witte.

==Agrarian reforms==

The reforms aimed to transform the traditional &quot;obshchina&quot; form of Russian agriculture, which bore some similarities to the open-field system of Britain. Serfs who had been liberated by the emancipation reform of 1861 lacked the financial ability to leave their new lands, as they owed money to the state for periods of up to 49 years. Perceived drawbacks of the &quot;obshchina&quot; system included collective ownership, scattered land allotments based on family size, and a significant level of control by the family elder. Stolypin, as a staunch conservative, also sought to eliminate the commune system — known as the &quot;mir&quot; — and to reduce radicalism among the peasants, thus preventing further political unrest such as that which occurred during the Revolution of 1905. Stolypin believed that tying the peasants to their own private land-holdings would produce profit-minded and politically conservative farmers like those living in parts of western Europe. Stolypin referred to his own programs as a &quot;wager on the strong and sober&quot;.

The reforms began with and introduced the unconditional right of individual landownership (Ukase of November 9, 1906). Stolypin&#x27;s reforms abolished the &quot;obshchina&quot; system and replaced it with a capitalist-oriented form highlighting private ownership and consolidated modern farmsteads designed to make peasants conservative instead of radical.

The multifaceted reforms introduced the following:
* development of large-scale individual farming (&quot;khutors&quot;)
* introduction of agricultural cooperatives
* development of agricultural education
* dissemination of new methods of land improvement
* affordable lines of credit for peasants i.e the Peasants&#x27; Land Bank to help peasants purchase their own farms

The state implemented the Stolypin agrarian reforms in a comprehensive campaign from 1906 through 1914. This system was not a command economy like that found in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, but rather a continuation of the modified state capitalism program begun under Sergei Witte. Stolypin&#x27;s program differed from Witte&#x27;s reforms not in the rapid push — which was a characteristic also found in the Witte reforms — but in the fact that Stolypin&#x27;s reforms were to the agricultural sector, including improvements to the rights of individuals on a broad level and had the backing of the police. These reforms laid the groundwork for a market-based agricultural system for Russian peasants.

The principal ministers involved in the implementation of the Stolypin agrarian reforms included Stolypin himself as Interior Minister and Prime Minister, Alexander Krivoshein as Agriculture and State Property Minister, and Vladimir Kokovtsov as Finance Minister and Stolypin&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister.

The Soviet agrarian program in the 1920s reversed the Stolypin reforms. The state took over land owned by peasants and moved them to collective farms.

==Colonization==
As a result of the expansion of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and other railroads east of the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea, migration to Siberia increased. Thompson estimated that between 1890 and 1914 that over 10 million persons migrated freely from western Russia to areas east of the Urals.

This was encouraged by the Trans-Siberian Railroad Committee, which was personally headed by Tsar Nicholas II. The Stolypin agrarian reforms included resettlement benefits for peasants who moved to Siberia. An emigration department was created in 1906 at the ministry of agriculture. It organized resettlement and assisted the settlers during their first years in the new settlements. The settlers received on average 16.5 hectares (40.8 acres) of land per man. The total area allocated was 21 million hectares. Migrants received a small state subsidy, exemption from some taxes, and advice from state agencies specifically developed to help with peasant resettlement.

In part thanks to these initiatives, approximately 2.8 million of the 10 million migrants to Siberia relocated between 1908 and 1913. This increased the population of the regions east of the Urals by 2.5 times before the outbreak of World War I.

==Cooperative initiatives==
A number of new types of cooperative assistance were developed as part of the Stolypin agrarian reforms, including financial-credit cooperation, production cooperation, and consumer cooperation. Many elements of Stolypin&#x27;s cooperation-assistance programs were later incorporated into the early agrarian programs of the Soviet Union, reflecting the lasting influence of Stolypin.

<doc id="976970" wikidata="Q39322" url="?curid=976970" title="Tibetan Mastiff">
<text>The Tibetan Mastiff is a large Tibetan dog breed. Its double coat is medium to long, subject to climate, and found in a wide variety of colors, including solid black, black and tan, various shades of red (from pale gold to deep red) and bluish-gray (dilute black), and sometimes with white markings around its neck, chest and legs. According to the American Kennel Club, male Tibetan Mastiffs have a weight of 40-70 kg (90-150 lbs) while females are 30-55 kg (70-120 lbs). 

==Name==
The term &quot;mastiff&quot; was assigned by the Europeans who first came to Tibet because that name was used to refer to nearly all large dog breeds in the West. Early Western visitors to Tibet misnamed several of its breeds, such as the Tibetan terrier, which is not a terrier, and the Tibetan spaniel, which is not a spaniel. A better name for the breed might be the &quot;Tibetan mountain dog&quot; or—to encompass the landrace breed throughout its range—the &quot;Himalayan mountain dog&quot;.

==Description==
===Appearance===

It typically retains the hardiness which would be required for it to survive in Tibet, Ladakh and other high-altitude Himalayan regions.

Instinctive behaviors, including canine pack behavior, contributed to the survival of the breed in harsh environments. It is one of the few primitive dog breeds that retains a single estrus per year instead of two, even at much lower altitudes and in much more temperate climates than its native climate. This characteristic is also found in wild canids such as the wolf and other wild animals. Since its estrus usually takes place during late autumn, most Tibetan Mastiff puppies are born between December and January.

Its double coat is long, subject to climate, and found in a wide variety of colors, including solid black, black and tan, various shades of red (from pale gold to deep red) and bluish-gray (dilute black), often with white markings. , some breeders had begun marketing white Tibetan mastiffs.

The coat of a Tibetan Mastiff lacks the unpleasant big-dog smell that affects many large breeds. The coat, whatever its length or color(s), should shed dirt and odors. Although the dogs shed somewhat throughout the year, there is generally one great molt in late winter or early spring and sometimes another, lesser molt in the late summer or early autumn. (Sterilization of the dog may dramatically affect the coat as to texture, density and shedding pattern.)

Tibetan Mastiffs are shown under one standard in the West, but separated by the Indian breed standard into two varieties: Lion Head (smaller; exceptionally long hair from forehead to withers, creating a ruff or mane) and Tiger Head (larger; shorter hair).

===Temperament===
As a flock guardian dog in Tibet, and in the West, it uses all the usual livestock guardian tactics (e.g., barking, scent-marking perimeters) to warn away predators and avoid direct confrontations.

As a socialized, more domestic dog, it can thrive in a spacious, fenced yard with a canine companion, but it is not an appropriate dog for apartment living. The Western-bred dogs are generally more easy-going, although still somewhat aloof with strangers. Through hundreds of years of selective breeding for a protective flock and family guardian, the breed has been prized for being a nocturnal sentry, keeping would-be predators and intruders at bay, and barking at unidentified sounds throughout the night. Leaving a Tibetan Mastiff outside all night with neighbors nearby is not recommended. They often sleep during the day, making them more active, alert, and aware at night.

Like all flock guardian breeds, they are intelligent and stubborn to a fault, so obedience training is recommended (although it is only mildly successful with some individuals) since this is a strong-willed, powerful-bodied breed. Unless they are to be used exclusively as livestock guardians, socialization training is also critical with this breed, because of their reserved nature with strangers and guardian instincts. They can be excellent family dogs, depending on the family; owners must understand canine psychology and be able and willing to spend a lot of time and devotion to training their dogs. Lack of consistency can result in the creation of unpredictable dogs. The protectiveness of Tibetan Mastiffs requires alertness and planning by the owner, in order to avoid mishaps when the dog is merely reacting as a guardian. The breed is not recommended for novice dog owners.

==Health==
Many breeders claim a life expectancy of 10–16 years, but these claims are unsubstantiated. Some lines do produce long-lived dogs. Other, more closely inbred lines, produce short-lived, unhealthy dogs. The breed has fewer genetic health problems than many breeds, but cases can be found of hypothyroidism, entropion, ectropion, distichiasis, skin problems including allergies, autoimmune problems including demodex, Addison&#x27;s disease, Cushing&#x27;s disease, missing teeth, malocclusion (overbite, underbite, dry mouth), cardiac problems, seizures, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataracts, and small ear canals with a tendency for infection. As with most large breeds, some will suffer with elbow or hip dysplasia.

Canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN), an inherited condition, appeared in one of the prominent lines of Tibetan Mastiffs in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, known carriers were bred extensively and are behind many lines still being actively bred. Because the mode of inheritance appears to be as a simple recessive, continued inbreeding can still produce affected puppies.

Hypothyroidism is fairly common in Tibetan Mastiffs, as it is in many large &quot;northern&quot; breeds. They should be tested periodically throughout their lives using a complete thyroid &quot;panel&quot;. However, because the standard thyroid levels were established using domestic dog breeds, test results must be considered in the context of what is &quot;normal&quot; for the breed, not what is normal across all breeds. Many dogs of this breed will have &quot;low&quot; thyroid values, but no clinical symptoms. Vets and owners differ on the relative merits of medicating dogs which test &quot;low&quot;, but are completely asymptomatic.

==History==

Originally these dogs were used to protect Buddhist monasteries and monks of Tibet from animals such as bears, wolves and snow leopards.

The Tibetan Mastiff is a phenotypically distinct dog breed that was bred as a flock guardian in the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateaus.

Meer Izzut-oollah (1872) wrote of the Tibetan Mastiff:

In the early 20th century, the Prince of Wales, the future George V, introduced a pair of Tibetan Mastiffs to the United Kingdom. By 1906, the breed was prevalent enough in England to be shown at the Crystal Palace show. However, during the war years, the breed lost favor and focus and nearly died out in England.

The breed has been gaining in popularity worldwide since 1980. Although the breed is still considered somewhat uncommon, as more active breeders arose and produced adequate numbers of dogs, various registries and show organizations (FCI, AKC) began to recognize the breed. In 2008, the Tibetan Mastiff competed for the first time in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

Since AKC recognition, the number of active breeders has skyrocketed, leading to over-breeding of puppies, many of which are highly inbred and of questionable quality. Initially, the breed suffered because of the limited gene pool from the original stock. By 2015, due to excessive breeding and unsuitability of the breed as a pet in urban situations, prices in China for the best dogs had fallen to about $2,000, and both lower quality and crossbreed dogs were being abandoned.

In 2011, a DNA study concluded that there was a genetic relationship between the Tibetan mastiff and the Great Pyrenees, Bernese Mountain Dog, Rottweiler and Saint Bernard, and that these large breed dogs are probably partially descended from the Tibetan Mastiff. In 2014, a study added the Leonberger to the list of possible relatives.

===Admixture with an unknown wolf-like canid===
The Tibetan Mastiff was able to adapt to the extreme highland conditions of the Tibetan Plateau very quickly compared with other mammals such as the yak, Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, and the wild boar. The Tibetan mastiff&#x27;s ability to avoid hypoxia in high altitudes, due to its higher hemoglobin levels compared with low-altitude dogs, was due to prehistoric interbreeding. In 2020, a genomic analysis indicates that a ghost population of an unknown wolf-like canid which is deeply-diverged from modern Holarctic wolves and dogs has contributed the EPAS1 allele found in both Himalayan wolves and dogs, and this allows them to live in high altitudes.

<doc id="976976" wikidata="Q1192212" url="?curid=976976" title="Emancipation reform of 1861">
<text>The emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia, also known as the Edict of Emancipation of Russia, ( – &quot;peasants&#x27; reform of 1861&quot;) was the first and most important of the liberal reforms enacted during the reign of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The reform effectively abolished serfdom throughout the Russian Empire.

The 1861 Emancipation Manifesto proclaimed the emancipation of the serfs on private estates and of the domestic (household) serfs. By this edict more than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords. Household serfs were the least affected: they gained only their freedom and no land.

The serfs were emancipated in 1861, a process which took place following a speech given by Tsar Alexander II on 30 March 1856. In Georgia, the emancipation took place later, in 1864, and on much better terms for the nobles than in Russia. State-owned serfs (those living on and working Imperial lands) were emancipated in 1866.

==Background==

Just prior to 1861 Russia had three main categories of peasants:
* Those who lived on state lands, many of them under control of the Ministry of State Property. Also included many non-Russians throughout the empire.
* Those who lived on crown domains, the udel
* Those who lived on private land, the so-called estate peasants.

Only those who were owned privately were considered serfs. They comprised an estimated 38% of the population. As well as having obligations to the state, they also were obliged to the landowner, who had great power over their lives.

The rural population lived in households (&quot;dvory&quot;, singular &quot;dvor&quot;), gathered as villages (&quot;derevni&quot;; a &quot;derevnya&quot; with a church became a &quot;selo&quot;), run by a &quot;mir&quot; (&#x27;commune&#x27;, or &quot;obshchina&quot; in official terms). Imperial Russia had around 20 million &quot;dvory&quot;, forty percent of them containing six to ten people.

The &quot;mir&quot; assembly, the &quot;skhod&quot; (&quot;sel&#x27;skii skhod&quot;), appointed an elder (&quot;starosta&quot;) and a &#x27;clerk&#x27; (&quot;pisar&quot;) to deal with any external issues. Although there were many regional differences and customs, peasants within a &quot;mir&quot; in central Russia shared land and resources. The strips were periodically redistributed within the villages to produce level economic conditions. The land, however, was not owned by the &quot;mir&quot;; the land was the legal property of the 100,000 or so landowners (&quot;pomeshchiks&quot;, an equivalent of &quot;landed gentry&quot;) and the inhabitants, as serfs, were typically not allowed to leave the property where they were born. The peasants were duty-bound to make regular payments in labor and goods. It has been estimated that landowners took at least one third of income and production by the first half of the nineteenth century.

==Earlier reform moves==
The need for urgent reform was well understood in 19th-century Russia. Much support for it emanated from universities, authors and other intellectual circles. Various projects of emancipation reforms were prepared by Mikhail Speransky, Nikolay Mordvinov, and Pavel Kiselyov. However, conservative or reactionary nobility thwarted their efforts. In Western &quot;guberniyas&quot; serfdom was abolished early in the century. In Congress Poland, serfdom had been abolished before it became Russian (by Napoleon in 1807), but it was largely restored once Russia took over in 1815. Serfdom was abolished in governorates of Estonia in 1816, in Courland in 1817, and in Livonia in 1819.

In 1797, Paul I of Russia decreed that corvee labor was limited to 3 days a week, and never on Sunday, but this law was not enforced. Beginning in 1801, Alexander I of Russia appointed a committee to study possible emancipation, but its only effect was to prohibit the sale of serfs without their families. Beginning in 1825, Nicholas I of Russia expressed his desire for emancipation on many occasions, and even improved the lives of serfs on state properties, but did not change the condition of serfs on private estates.

==Shaping of the manifesto==

The liberal politicians who stood behind the 1861 manifesto—Nikolay Milyutin, Alexei Strol&#x27;man and Yakov Rostovtsev—also recognized that their country was one of a few remaining feudal states in Europe. The pitiful display by Russian forces in the Crimean War left the government acutely aware of the empire&#x27;s weaknesses. Eager to grow and develop industrial and therefore military and political strength, they introduced a number of economic reforms. It was optimistically hoped that after the abolition the &quot;mir&quot; would dissolve into individual peasant land owners and the beginnings of a market economy.

Alexander II, unlike his father, was willing to deal with this problem. Moving on from a petition from the Lithuanian provinces, a committee &quot;for ameliorating the condition of the peasants&quot; was founded and the principles of the abolition considered.

The main point at issue was whether the serfs should remain dependent on the landlords, or whether they should be transformed into a class of independent communal proprietors.

The land-owners initially pushed for granting the peasants freedom but not any land. The tsar and his advisers, mindful of 1848 events in Western Europe, were opposed to creating a proletariat and the instability this could bring. But giving the peasants freedom &quot;and&quot; land seemed to leave the existing land-owners without the large and cheap labour-force they needed to maintain their estates and lifestyles. By 1859 however, a third of their estates and two-thirds of their serfs were mortgaged to the state or noble banks. This was why they had to accept the emancipation.

To &#x27;balance&#x27; this, the legislation contained three measures to reduce the potential economic self-sufficiency of the peasants. Firstly a transition period of two years was introduced, during which the peasant was obligated as before to the old land-owner. Secondly large parts of common land were passed to the major land-owners as &quot;otrezki&quot; (&quot;cut off lands&quot;), making many forests, roads and rivers accessible only for a fee. The third measure was that the serfs must pay the land-owner for their allocation of land in a series of redemption payments, which in turn, were used to compensate the landowners with bonds. The government would advance 75% of the total sum to the land-owner, and then the peasants would repay the government, plus interest, over forty-nine years. The government finally cancelled these redemption payments in 1907.

==Emancipation Manifesto==

The legal basis of the reform was the Tsar&#x27;s Emancipation Manifesto of , accompanied by the set of legislative acts under the general name &quot;Regulations Concerning Peasants Leaving Serf Dependence&quot; ( &quot;Polozheniya o krestyanakh, vykhodyashchikh iz krepostnoi zavisimosti&quot;).

This Manifesto proclaimed the emancipation of the serfs on private estates and of the domestic (household) serfs. Serfs were granted the full rights of free citizens, gaining the rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto also permitted peasants to buy the land from the landlords.

==Implementation==
&quot;Mir&quot; communities had the power to distribute the land given to newly freed serfs by the Russian government amongst individuals within the community. Due to the community&#x27;s ownership of the land, as opposed to the individual&#x27;s, an individual peasant could not sell his portion of the land to go work in a factory in the city. A peasant was required to pay off long-term loans received by the government. The money from these loans was given to the primary landowner. The land allotted to the recently freed serfs did not include the best land in the country, which remained in the hands of the nobility.

The implementation of land settlement varied over the vast and diverse territory of the Russian Empire, but typically a peasant had rights to buy out about half of the land he cultivated for himself. If he could not afford to pay it off, he would receive a half of the half, i.e., a quarter of the land, free. It was called pauper&#x27;s allotment (&quot;bednyatskiy nadel&quot;).

Many reform-minded peasants believed the manifesto&#x27;s conditions were unacceptable: &quot;In many localities the peasants refused to believe that the manifesto was genuine. There were troubles, and troops had to be called in to disperse the angry crowds.&quot; The land-owners and nobility were paid in government bonds, with their debts deducted. The bonds soon fell in value. The management skills of the land-owners were generally poor.

Some Mir&#x27;s did not enter the land redemption process at all, remaining as temporarily obligated peasants under their former owners until an 1881 decree made redemption compulsory. In 1883, concerned by rising levels of tax arrears, the government made a 13% cut (varying by commune, as a national average) to payment rates to combat the problem.

==Outcomes==
Despite newly acquired freedom, the life of a serf remained grim in many aspects. Household serfs benefited the least, gaining their freedom, but no land. Many bureaucrats believed that these reforms would bring about drastic changes that would only affect the &quot;lower stories&quot; of society, strengthening the autocracy. In reality, the reforms forced the monarch to coexist with an independent court, free press, and local governments—all operating differently and more freely than they had in the past. This new form of local government involved in each area an assembly called a &quot;zemstvo&quot;. In regards to new localized government, the reforms put in place a system where the landowners were now able to have more of a say within their newly formed &quot;provinces&quot;. While this was not the direct intent of the reforms, it was evident that this significantly weakened the idea of the autocracy. Now, the &quot;well-to-do&quot; serfs, along with previously free peoples, were able to purchase land as private property. While early in the reforms the creation of local government had not changed many things about Russian society, the rise in capitalism drastically affected not only the social structure of Russia, but the behaviors and activities of the self-government institutions. With new, capitalistic ideals, local government was not responsible for the rules and regulations dictating how the new market would operate. If there was a positive of this movement towards localized government, from the autocracy&#x27;s point of view; it was (as Petr Valuev put it): the &quot;zemstvo&quot; would &quot;provide activity for the considerable portion of the press as well as those malcontents who currently stir up trouble because they have nothing to do&quot;.

===Effects on the serfs===
The serfs of private estates received less land than they needed to survive, which led to civil unrest. The redemption tax was so high that the serfs had to sell all the grain they produced to pay the tax, which left nothing for their survival. Landowners also suffered because many of them were deeply in debt, and the forced selling of their land left them struggling to maintain their lavish lifestyle. In many cases, the newly freed serfs were forced to &quot;rent&quot; their land from wealthy landowners. Furthermore, when the peasants had to work for the same landowners to pay their &quot;labor payments&quot;, they often neglected their own fields. Over the next few years, the yields from the peasants&#x27; crops remained low, and soon famine struck a large portion of Russia. With little food, and finding themselves in a similar condition as when they were serfs, many peasants started to voice their disdain for the new social system. On one occasion, on 12 April 1861, a local leader murdered a large number of uprising peasants in the village of Bezdna. When the incident was over, the official report counted 70 peasants dead and another 100 wounded. After further investigation, and trial of some members of the uprising, five peasants were found guilty of &quot;agitation&quot; and not uprising. That said, several different instances did take the form of an uprising.

===Aftermath===
In Congress Poland and in northern Russia peasants became both free and landless (batraks), with only their labour to sell, while in other areas peasants became the majority land-owners in their province(s). The 1861 Emancipation Manifesto affected only the privately owned serfs. The state-owned serfs were emancipated in 1866 and were given better and larger plots of land.

The reforms changed the Russian economy. The individuals who led the reform favored an economic system similar to that in other European countries, which promoted the ideas of capitalism and free trade. The reformers aimed to promote development and to encourage the ownership of private property, free competition, entrepreneurship, and hired labor. This they hoped would bring about an economic system with minimal regulations and tariffs, thus a more &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economy. Soon after the reforms there was a substantial rise in the amount of production of grain for sale. Because of this there was also a rise in the number of hired laborers and in farm machinery. Furthermore, an indicator of the change to the Russian economy post-reform was the huge growth in non-gentry private landownership. While the gentry land-holdings fell from 80% to 50%, the peasant holdings grew from 5% to 20%.

<doc id="976986" wikidata="Q935033" url="?curid=976986" title="Japanese battleship Kirishima">
<text>was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy which saw service during World War I and World War II. Designed by British naval engineer George Thurston, she was the third launched of the four s. Laid down in 1912 at the Mitsubishi Shipyards in Nagasaki, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was formally commissioned in 1915 on the same day as her sister ship, . &quot;Kirishima&quot; patrolled on occasion off the Chinese coast during World War I, and helped with rescue efforts following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

Starting in 1927, &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s first reconstruction rebuilt her as a battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan&#x27;s growing carrier fleet, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, &quot;Kirishima&quot; acted primarily as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China. On the eve of World War II, she sailed as part of Vice-Admiral Chuichi Nagumo&#x27;s &quot;Kido Butai&quot; as an escort for the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

As part of the Third Battleship Division, &quot;Kirishima&quot; participated in many of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s early actions in 1942, providing support for the invasion of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and in the Indian Ocean raid of April 1942. During the Battle of Midway, she provided escort to Nagumo&#x27;s four carriers, before redeploying to the Solomon Islands during the Battle of Guadalcanal. She escorted Japanese carrier fleets during the battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz Islands, before sailing as part of a bombardment force under Admiral Nobutake Kondō during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.

On the evening of 13 November 1942, &quot;Kirishima&quot; engaged American cruisers and destroyers alongside her sister ship . On the night of 14/15 November, in one of only two battleship duels of the Pacific War, &quot;Kirishima&quot; attacked and damaged the American battleship before being fatally crippled in turn by the battleship under the command of then Captain Glenn B. Davis. &quot;Kirishima&quot; capsized and sank in the early morning on 15 November 1942 in Ironbottom Sound.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Kirishima&quot; was the third of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s s, a group of capital ships designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston. The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of in 1908. The four battlecruisers of the &quot;Kongō&quot; class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time; they have been called the battlecruiser version of the British (formerly Turkish) battleship . With their heavy armament and armor protection (which took up 23.3% of their approximately 30,000 ton displacement), &quot;Kirishima&quot; and her sister ships were vastly superior to any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time.

The keel of &quot;Kirishima&quot; was laid down at the Nagasaki shipyards of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on 17 March 1912, with most of the parts used in her construction manufactured in Japan. Due to a shortage of available slipways, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and her sister ship were the first two capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy to be built in private Japanese shipyards. After her launch on 1 December 1913, &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s fitting-out began later that month. On 15 December 1914, Captain Kamaya Rokuro was assigned as her chief equipping officer, and she was completed on 19 April 1915.

===Armament===
&quot;Kirishima&quot;″s main battery consisted of eight heavy-caliber main guns in four twin turrets (two forward, two aft). The turrets were noted by the US Office of Naval Intelligence to be &quot;similar to the British 15-inch turrets&quot;, with improvements made in flash-tightness. Each of her main guns could fire high-explosive or armor-piercing shells a maximum distance of at a firing rate of two shells per minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;14/45&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ship&#x27;s magazines could accommodate ninety rounds of ammunition for each of the main guns, which had an approximate barrel life of 250–280 shots. In 1941, dyes were introduced for the armor-piercing shells of the four &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battleships, with &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s shells using blue dye.

Her secondary battery was originally sixteen 50-caliber medium guns in single casemates (all located amidships), eight anti-aircraft guns, and eight submerged torpedo tubes. The sixteen 6-inch/50 caliber guns were capable of firing 5–6 rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 500 rounds. The 6-inch/50 caliber gun was capable of firing both antiaircraft and antiship shells, though the positioning of the guns on &quot;Kirishima&quot; made antiaircraft firing impractical. During her second reconstruction, the 3-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight guns. These guns could fire between 8 and 14 rounds per minute, with a barrel life of 800–1500 rounds. Designed to fire antiaircraft, antiship, and illumination shells, the 5-inch/40 caliber had the widest variety of shot type of &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s guns. During her second reconstruction, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was also fitted with a small number of Type 96 antiaircraft autocannons.

==Service==

===1914–1927: Battlecruiser===

&quot;Kirishima&quot; was formally commissioned on 19 April 1915, and along with was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the First Fleet. After seven months of trials, she was reassigned to the 3rd Battleship Division of the Second Fleet, with Captain Shima Takeshi in overall command of the ship. In April 1916, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; departed Sasebo Naval Base to patrol the East China Sea for ten days. She remained in Sasebo until April 1917, when she again deployed to the Chinese coast with her sister ships &quot;Haruna&quot; and . Her last patrol operation of World War I was off the Chinese and Korean coast in April 1918. In July 1918, &quot;Kirishima&quot; acted as the transport of Prince Arthur of Connaught for his extended cruise to Canada, before returning to Japan.

Following the end of World War I, the Japanese Empire gained control of former German possessions in the central Pacific per the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Due to Japan&#x27;s warm relations with the British Empire and the United States at the time, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and other Japanese warships became significantly less active than during the war. On 1 December 1920, she was reassigned to the Third Division of the Second Fleet. Other than a patrol alongside &quot;Kongō&quot; and off the Chinese coast in August 1921, &quot;Kirishima&quot; remained in Sasebo. On 10 September 1922, she collided with the destroyer during fleet maneuvers, with both ships sustaining minor damage. Following the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923, the capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy assisted in rescue work until the end of the month. She was placed in reserve in December 1923.

With the conclusion of World War I and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy was significantly lessened, with a ratio of 5:5:3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. The treaty also banned Japan from building any new capital ships until 1931, with no capital ship permitted to exceed 35,000 tons. Provided that new additions did not exceed 3,000 tons, existing capital ships were permitted to be upgraded with improved torpedo bulges and deck armor. By the time the Washington Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan, only three classes of World War I-era capital ships—the and battleships, and the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers—remained active.

===1927–1934: Battleship===

Stripped of the ability to construct new capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy instead opted to significantly upgrade and reconfigure their existing battleships and battlecruisers. &quot;Kirishima&quot; was placed in Third Reserve in December 1926, before beginning her first reconstruction in early 1927. Horizontal armor over the ammunition magazines was strengthened, and she was also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. To upgrade &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s speed, the 36 coal-fired Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with ten new mixed-firing Kampon boilers. To allow for more equipment to be installed on board, her forward superstructure was reconstructed in the Pagoda mast style, requiring removal of one of her three funnels. The reconstruction of the &quot;Kongō&quot;-class battlecruisers added an additional 4,000 tons of armor to the ships, directly violating the terms of the Washington Treaty. On 16 April 1930, the reconstruction was declared complete.

Six days after &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s reconstruction was completed, Japan pledged to scrap several battleships and signed the London Naval Treaty, which placed further bans on capital ship construction until 1937. From August to October 1930, she was outfitted with the equipment necessary to equip reconnaissance seaplanes. &quot;Kirishima&quot; patrolled the coast of China near Shanghai in April 1932, before she was again placed in the Third Reserve.

In September 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria. On 25 February 1933, based on a report by the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty in its invasion of Manchuria. Refusing to accept the organization&#x27;s judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day. Immediately following, Japan also withdrew from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of her capital ships.

===1934–1941: Fast battleship===

On 18 November 1934, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was drydocked in Sasebo Naval Arsenal in preparation for her second reconstruction, which would enable her to function alongside Japan&#x27;s growing fleet of fast carriers. Her stern was lengthened by , while her superstructure was rebuilt to allow for new fire-control mechanisms. Her boilers were removed and replaced with eight new oil-fired Kampon Boilers, and she received newer geared turbines. The elevation of her main and secondary battery was increased, and she was equipped with two Nakajima E8N &quot;Dave&quot; and Kawanishi E7K &quot;Alf&quot; reconnaissance floatplanes. To this end, aircraft catapults and launch-rails were also refitted. Her older 3-inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 5-inch dual-purpose guns. She was also outfitted with twenty Type 96 25 mm antiaircraft guns in twin turrets, while two of her 6-inch guns and her remaining torpedo tubes were removed.

&quot;Kirishima&quot;″s armor was also extensively upgraded. Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8 inches (as opposed to varying thicknesses of 6–8 inches before the upgrades), while diagonal bulkheads of a depth ranging from reinforced the main armored belt. The turret armor was strengthened to , while were added to portions of the deck armor. The armor around her ammunition magazines was also strengthened over the course of the refit. The reconstruction was declared complete on 8 June 1936. Capable of speeds of up to , &quot;Kirishima&quot; was reclassified as a fast battleship.

In August 1936, &quot;Kirishima&quot; departed Sasebo alongside to patrol the Chinese coast off Amoy. From March 1937 to April 1939, she was frequently deployed as a support vessel and troop transport during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In November 1938, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was designated the command vessel of the Third Battleship Division, and was under the command of Rear Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. In November 1939, she was placed in reserve and fitted with additional armor on the front faces of her turrets and barbettes.

On 11 November 1941, after a series of transfers between Japanese naval bases, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was outfitted in preparation for coming hostilities and assigned—alongside her sister ships—to the Third Battleship Division. On 26 November, &quot;Kirishima&quot; departed Hitokappu Bay, Kurile Islands in the company of &quot;Hiei&quot; and six Japanese fast carriers of the First Air Fleet Striking Force (, , , , , and ). On 7 December 1941, aircraft from these six carriers attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at their home base of Pearl Harbor, sinking four U.S. Navy battleships and numerous other vessels. Following the attack and the declaration of war by the United States, &quot;Kirishima&quot; returned to Japan.

===1942: Combat and loss===
On 8 January 1942, &quot;Kirishima&quot; departed Japan for Truk Naval Base in the Caroline Islands alongside the Carrier Strike Force. She provided escort during the invasion of New Britain on 17 January before returning to Truk. She sortied again in response to American carrier raids in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. In March 1942, while supporting fleet operations off of Java in the Dutch East Indies, one of &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s floatplanes bombed an enemy merchant vessel. South of Java, the Japanese fleet was surprised by the appearance of the destroyer . &quot;Hiei&quot; and initially opened fire on the ship but failed to score any hits. After dive-bombers from three of Admiral Nagumo&#x27;s carriers immobilized the destroyer, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and the other two ships resumed firing on &quot;Edsall&quot; until she sank.

In April 1942, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and the Third Battleship division joined five fleet carriers and two cruisers in an attack against British naval bases in the Indian Ocean. On 5 April—Easter Sunday—the Japanese fleet attacked the harbor at Colombo in Ceylon, while seaplanes from the spotted two fleeing British cruisers, both of which were later sunk by aerial attack. A floatplane from &quot;Kirishima&quot; also strafed a withdrawing oil tanker. On 8 April, Japanese carrier aircraft attacked the Royal Navy base at Trincomalee in Ceylon, only to find that all of Admiral James Somerville&#x27;s remaining warships had withdrawn the previous night. Returning from the attack, a floatplane from &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Haruna&quot; spotted the aircraft carrier and escorting destroyer , which were quickly sunk by a massive aerial attack. Upon returning to Japan, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was drydocked and her secondary armament configuration modified with the addition of 25 mm antiaircraft guns in twin mounts.

In June 1942, &quot;Kirishima&quot; sailed as part of the Carrier Strike Force during the Battle of Midway, providing escort for Admiral Nagumo&#x27;s four fast carriers alongside &quot;Haruna&quot;. Following the disastrous battle, during which all four Japanese aircraft carriers were destroyed, she took on survivors from the carriers before returning to Japan. In August 1942, she departed Japan for the Solomon Islands in the company of &quot;Hiei&quot;, three carriers, three cruisers and eleven destroyers, in response to the American invasion of Guadalcanal. She escorted Japanese carriers during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, during which the light carrier was sunk. Following the battle, the fleet returned to Truk Naval Base. During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, &quot;Kirishima&quot; was part of Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe&#x27;s Vanguard Force, which provided distant cover to Nagumo&#x27;s carrier groups. She was attacked by American dive-bombers on 26 October, yet remained undamaged.

On 10 November 1942, &quot;Kirishima&quot; departed Truk alongside &quot;Hiei&quot; and eleven destroyers in preparation to shell American positions on Guadalcanal in advance of a major transport convoy of Japanese troops. U.S. Navy reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Japanese fleet several days in advance, and a U. S. Navy force of two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and eight destroyers was deployed under the command of Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan in Ironbottom Sound to meet them. At 01:24 on 13 November, the Japanese force was detected out by the light cruiser . In the ensuing First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the American task force concentrated the majority of their firepower on the battleship &quot;Hiei&quot;. This enabled &quot;Kirishima&quot; to score multiple hits on the &quot;Helena&quot; and heavy cruiser . Both &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot; then raked &quot;San Francisco&quot; with shellfire, killing Rear Admiral Callaghan. However, &quot;Hiei&quot; was in turn crippled by &quot;San Francisco&quot; and several American destroyers. With &quot;Hiei&quot; effectively out of the battle, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and the surviving destroyers withdrew to the north. On the morning of 13 November, she was ordered to tow &quot;Hiei&quot; to safety. However, the heavily damaged battleship came under air attack, and was eventually abandoned and scuttled.

On the evening of 13 November, &quot;Kirishima&quot; and her escorting destroyers were joined by the Fourth Cruiser Division and prepared to reenter Savo Sound, the Solomon Islands - &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot; under the command of Admiral Nobutake Kondō. In the early morning of 14 November, three Japanese heavy cruisers bombarded Guadalcanal before withdrawing. Aware of the damage suffered by his ships the previous night, Admiral William Halsey reinforced the American naval units with the new battleships and . The two fleets made contact on 14 November at 23:01. They exchanged gunfire and torpedoes, with four American destroyers disabled (three would later sink), while the destroyer was crippled by &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot;.

&quot;Kirishima&quot; and the heavy cruiser illuminated &quot;South Dakota&quot; with searchlights, and almost all of Kondō&#x27;s force opened fire on her. &quot;Kirishima&quot; achieved hits on &quot;South Dakota&quot; with at least three 14-inch salvos, which failed to penetrate her armor, and several salvos from her secondary battery, which knocked out the battleship&#x27;s fire control systems and communications. At 23:40, &quot;South Dakota&quot; suffered a series of electrical failures, crippling her radar, radios and gun batteries.

&quot;Washington&quot;, undetected, started firing at midnight on &quot;Kirishima&quot; from , point-blank range for &quot;Washington&quot;″s 16-inch/45-caliber guns, which were easily capable of penetrating &quot;Kirishima&quot;″s armor at their maximum range. &quot;Kirishima&quot; was hit by at least twenty primary and seventeen secondary battery projectiles, penetrating the magazines for her forward 14-inch turrets (the magazines were flooded before they detonated), destroying the hydraulic pumps that powered her rear 14-inch turrets and steering, setting her superstructure afire, and causing flooding that led to an 18 degree list to starboard. Initially, the light cruiser attempted to tow her out of Ironbottom Sound. When it became clear she could not be salvaged, the surviving Japanese destroyers evacuated Captain Iwabuchi and the remaining survivors. &quot;Kirishima&quot; capsized and sank at 03:25 on the morning of 15 November 1942, with 212 crewmen lost.

===Wreck===

&quot;Kirishima&quot;″s wreck was discovered by Robert Ballard during an expedition to map the wrecks from the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1992. She lies upside down, with her bow section missing from the bridge forward due to a magazine explosion. Her anchor chain is wrapped around her stern section.
Ballard&#x27;s investigation of the wreck unfortunately was aborted due to a technical emergency, resulting in the dive only lasting some nine minutes.
This severely limited any information or images obtained.
A further expedition to the wreck by Paul Allen&#x27;s in January 2019 provided detailed information on both the damage received during the battle and confirms the subsequent detonation of her forward main magazines during the sinking process.

<doc id="976989" wikidata="Q2479210" url="?curid=976989" title="The Doom Generation">
<text>The Doom Generation is a 1995 independent black comedy thriller film co-produced, co-edited, written and directed by Gregg Araki, and starring Rose McGowan, James Duval and Jonathan Schaech. The plot follows two troubled teenage lovers who pick up an adolescent drifter and embark on a journey full of sex, violence, and convenience stores.

Billed as &quot;A Heterosexual Movie by Gregg Araki&quot;, &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; is the second installment in the director&#x27;s trilogy known as the &quot;Teenage Apocalypse&quot; film trilogy, preceded by &quot;Totally Fucked Up&quot; (1993) and followed by &quot;Nowhere&quot; (1997). The characters of Amy Blue and Jordan White are based on the Mark Beyer comic strip &quot;Amy and Jordan&quot;.

Araki&#x27;s major film debut, shooting primarily took place at night during January 1994 in Los Angeles on a budget of $800,000. The crew avoided well known landmarks and shot in undeveloped areas of urban sprawl to give an apocalyptic feel. The budget allowed Araki to hire professional crew, making it the first of his films not shot by himself.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 1995. It received mixed reviews from critics. During the press screening, many critics left. However, at the San Francisco International Film Festival (SFIFF), it received critical acclaim, most proclaiming it as Araki&#x27;s breakthrough. Distributed by Trimark Pictures, it was released in the United States on October 27, 1995. While not a financial success, earning only $284,785 at the box office, McGowan was nominated for Best Debut Performance at the 11th Independent Spirit Awards.

==Plot==
Teenage lovers Jordan White and Amy Blue pick up a handsome drifter named Xavier Red while driving home from a club. Jordan gives Xavier the nickname &quot;X&quot;. A late-night stop at a convenience store leaves the three on the run when X accidentally kills the store&#x27;s owner, forcing the trio to hide in a motel to avoid arrest. Jordan and Amy have sex in the bathtub, while X watches and masturbates from behind the bathroom door. X then learns from the local television news program that the store owner&#x27;s wife disemboweled her children with a machete before committing suicide. This leads X to believe that the trio won&#x27;t be considered suspects or be found by police.

Later that evening, Amy has sex with X, despite their mutual dislike of each other. Eventually Jordan finds out, and things become tense as the two men develop a lingering sexual attraction for one another. As the trio journeys around the city of Los Angeles, they continue to get into violent (almost comedic; every item the trio buys always comes out to $6.66) situations due to people either claiming to be Amy&#x27;s previous lovers or mistaking her for such. These incidents get the attention of the FBI, and their goal is to find Amy and kill her (exactly the same sentiment is voiced by several other parties in the film). She is mistakenly identified by a fast food window clerk as &quot;Sunshine&quot; and later by a character played by Parker Posey as &quot;Kitten&quot;.

Jordan, Amy and X spend the night in an abandoned warehouse, where they engage in a threesome. While Amy goes to urinate, Jordan and X are attacked by a trio of neo-Nazis, one of whom had previously mistaken Amy for his ex-girlfriend &quot;Bambi&quot;. The gang first severely beats up X, then holds Jordan down as the aforementioned neo-Nazi ties up and rapes Amy on top of an American flag. The group finally cuts off Jordan&#x27;s penis with pruning shears and forces the severed penis into his mouth. After Amy breaks free, she kills the neo-Nazis with the shears and escapes with X, leaving Jordan for dead. The film ends with Amy and X driving in her car. X offers Amy a Dorito, to no reply. Aimless on an empty road, the credits roll.

==Cast==
==Release==
===Home media===
The film was initially acquired by The Samuel Goldwyn Company, but was dropped due to content objections, before being picked up by Trimark Pictures. Its home video release had many cuts and differed greatly from the original version seen at Sundance. In March 2012, the UK company Second Sight Films released a DVD with anamorphic widescreen and director/cast commentary. Previous releases up until this point lacked the commentary, with many lacking the widescreen format.

=== Director&#x27;s cut ===

The first cut as shown at Sundance featured several scenes removed from future releases. It was shown at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, restored in 4K with 5.1 surround sound, with the restoration supervised by Araki. This version released in cinemas around the US, starting April 6, 2023, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of Newfest&#x27;s series &quot;Queering the Canon: Totally Radical&quot;.

According to Araki, the new 4K restoration of &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; is the only one that he wants audiences to watch from here on out: &quot;I hope that this new version of it wipes those old copies out entirely, because they&#x27;re so inferior. There was an R-rated cut of &quot;Doom Generation&quot; that was made without my approval, and it&#x27;s terrible. It&#x27;s literally been butchered beyond recognition, and I&#x27;d prefer that people don&#x27;t watch it at all than watch that copy of it.&quot;

This version of the film was released on Blu-ray from Strand Releasing in the fall of 2023. In 2024, The Criterion Collection announced its own release of the director&#x27;s cut as part of its &quot;Gregg Araki&#x27;s Teen Apocalypse Trilogy&quot; set, released on September 24 of that year.

==Reception==
&quot;The Doom Generation&quot; received mixed reviews, with critics often comparing the film both favorably and unfavorably to Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. Film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, gives the film a score of 56% based on 41 reviews.

Giving the film its very first review, in &quot;Variety&quot;, Emanuel Levy noted: &quot;Stylishly yet personally expressive, &#x27;The Doom Generation&#x27; marks an innovative turning point in Araki&#x27;s career.&quot; Roger Ebert rated the film &quot;zero stars&quot; and objected to what he perceived as its cynicism, ironic detachment, and depictions of blasé violence, writing: &quot;Note carefully that I do not object to the content of his movie, but to the attitude. ... Araki may not have been thinking of Leopold and Loeb when he made his movie, but I was when I watched it.&quot; Ricky da Conceição of &quot;Sound on Sight&quot; named the film the best of Araki&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy&quot; and said it &quot;represented a major artistic leap forward&quot; for Araki, who &quot;creates a twisted pastiche of science fiction, nihilistic road movie and teen angst filtered with deadpan comedy and his own unique commentary on the depravity of modern America.&quot; He praised the set design, lighting, score and actress Rose McGowan, who &quot;steals the show as the foul mouthed, morally aimless on crystal meth and Diet Coke.&quot;

<text>Orchard Road, often known colloquially as simply Orchard, is a major -long road in the Central Area of Singapore. A famous tourist attraction, it is an upscale shopping area, with numerous internationally renowned department stores, shopping malls, restaurants, and coffeehouses located in its vicinity. It is a popular hotspot in Singapore, especially at night, attracting trendy urban youth.

The Orchard Planning Area is a planning area as specified by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. It is part of the Central Area located within the Central Region. Orchard is bordered by Newton in the east and north, Tanglin in the west, River Valley in the south and Museum to the southeast. It consists of three subzones, Orchard, Somerset and Tanglin (not to be confused with its neighbouring planning area).

==Toponymy==
Orchard Road got its name from the nutmeg, pepper, and fruit orchards or plantations that the road once led to. Such plantations were common in the area in the 19th century. Previously, it was known in Hokkien as &quot;Tang Leng Pa Sat Koi&quot; (), and in Tamil, it was known as &quot;Vairakimadam&quot; () inside town limits and &quot;Māttu Than&quot; () from Koek&#x27;s Market to Upper Tanglin.

==Geography==
After more than a century as a two-way thoroughfare, Orchard Road became a one-way street east of Scotts Road in 1974. and entirely in 1977 when Orchard Boulevard was completed. Orchard Road starts at the junction with Orange Grove Road, which is the location of the Orchard Hotel. It then stretches southeast across the Scotts Road–Paterson Hill junction, Orchard MRT station, Bideford Road, Somerset MRT station, Central Expressway, Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and ends at the junction with Handy Road (just before Prinsep Street), where it becomes Bras Basah Road. It has extensive underground infrastructure, including underground pedestrian walkways between the malls running underneath the street and other streets in the vicinity. The numbers begin at Handy Road and end at Orange Grove Road.

==History==

===British administration===
Orchard Road was already cut in the 1830s, though the new road was not named in George Coleman&#x27;s 1836 &quot;Map of Singapore&quot;. In the 1830s the Orchard Road area was the scene of gambier and pepper plantations. Later, nutmeg plantations and fruit orchards predominated, hence its name.

By 1846, the spread of houses had reached up to Tank Road. There were none on the left side and only three or four houses went past Tank Road on the right side of Orchard Road.

One major sight during this period was a Dr. Jun tending his garden, which helped endorse the road&#x27;s name. He had a garden and plantation at the corner of what is now Scotts Road and Orchard Road.

Towards the later part of the 1840s, graveyards began to appear along the road. By 1846, the Chinese had a large graveyard around what is now the Hilton Singapore Orchard and Ngee Ann City, while the Sumatrans from Bencoolen had their burial ground where the current Hotel Grand Central stands. Later a Jewish cemetery was established; it was located where Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is now and was demolished in 1984.

In the 1860s, Orchard Road had a great number of private houses and bungalows on hills looking down through the valley where the road passed through. Early in the 1890s, King Chulalongkorn, the then King of Siam, acquired &quot;Hurricane House&quot; in the vicinity of Orchard Road through Tan Kim Ching, the Thai Consul in Singapore. Two further pieces of adjoining property fronting onto Orchard Road were purchased in 1897. These subsequently became the site of the Royal Thai Embassy at 370 Orchard Road. Hurricane House was sold off around 1909 shortly before the King&#x27;s death.

In the early 20th century, it was noted that Orchard Road &quot;present[ed] the appearance of a well-shaded avenue to English mansion[s],&quot; comparable in its &quot;quiet but effective beauty to Devonshire lanes.&quot;

In the 1960s, a group of Indonesian forces bombed the MacDonald House in Singapore, just a few months before Singapore got its independence from Malaysia. A number of people were killed and the police managed to execute the two military officers responsible for this.

=== Smoking ban ===

Orchard Road was initially designated to be completely smoke-free with the exception of designated smoking areas by 1 July 2018. However, the implementation was pushed back to 31 December 2018, as businesses will need more time to identify appropriate locations and set up designated areas for smoking, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). Food establishments that currently have smoking corners within the no-smoking zones will also be given the same extension to remove them. Currently, around 40 designated smoking areas have been set up, including five public ones at Orchard Towers, Far East Plaza, The Heeren, Cuppage Terrace, and behind Somerset MRT station. Since its announcement, NEA has said that the majority of stakeholders have been supportive of this initiative.

As of 1 January 2019, Orchard Road was officially declared as a strictly smoke-free zone except within the designated smoking areas.

==Notable past and present landmarks==

At Orchard Road&#x27;s eastern end is the official residence and office of the President of Singapore, the Istana, marked with Nibong palms and a plaque that reads, &quot;As the nibong is a mangrove palm, this site must have once been a mangrove swamp.&quot;

Singapore&#x27;s first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s house is located at 38 Oxley Road, which is just south of Orchard Road.

On the western side of Orchard Road is the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the only tropical garden in the world that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

About halfway down Orchard Road are Cairnhill and Emerald Hill, which are mainly private residential areas. Next to Emerald Hill is Centrepoint, which houses the supermarket Cold Storage, the oldest surviving business establishment in the area. Amber Mansions, one of the earliest apartment blocks in Singapore, which was built around the turn of the 20th century, was torn down in the 1980s to make way for the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.

Specialists&#x27; Shopping Centre was one of the earliest redevelopment projects on Orchard Road. It occupied the site of the former Pavilion Cinema, which was demolished in 1979. Specialists&#x27; Shopping Centre was itself demolished in 2007 to make way for new development, called Orchard Gateway.

Elsewhere just off Orchard Road is Scotts Road. Scotts Shopping Centre housed Singapore&#x27;s first food court, which sat below the Ascott Singapore. It was torn down in June 2007 to make way for Scotts Square.

==Shopping==

The first shop of note on Orchard Road was Tangs founded in 1934 and established on Orchard Road in the 1950s.

Orchard Road shopping malls include ION Orchard, Wisma Atria, Ngee Ann City, Orchard Central, Orchard Gateway, 313 @ Somerset, Orchard Plaza, Plaza Singapura, The Centrepoint, The Heeren, Mandarin Gallery, Cathay Cineleisure Orchard, Wheelock Place, Liat Towers, Shaw House and Scotts Square.

==Transport==

===Public transport===
====Trains====
There are four major MRT stations in the Orchard Road vicinity: Orchard, Orchard Boulevard, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations. These stations are important hubs for commuters, locals, students and tourists who travel to the shopping and business district of Orchard.

====Buses====
Bus services provided by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore provide access to Orchard Road. Bus stops are staggered to avoid causing congestion, with the scheme being implemented on 13 May 2004 (1st Phase, Mandarin Orchard Singapore) and 28 May 2004 (2nd Phase, Midpoint Orchard). A bus lane was introduced in 2005, operational from 7.30 am to 8 pm, Monday to Saturday. It was extended to 24 hours in 2016. Westbound passengers can board their buses at Penang Road (Dhoby Ghaut Station), Somerset Road (Somerset Station), Orchard Turn (opp Ngee Ann City/Takashimaya), Orchard Turn (Orchard Station), Orchard Boulevard (opp Orchard Station) and Orchard Boulevard (Wheelock Place).

====Taxi====
Orchard Road has numerous taxi stands, which are mostly found at shopping centres and hotels. It is prohibited to hail taxis at locations other than these official stands.

=== Vehicular access ===
Those driving into Orchard Road may enter from the west via Tanglin Road. Vehicles from Bukit Timah Road or Newton Road that travel via Scotts Road can turn left into Orchard Road at the Marriott Hotel junction. Vehicles coming from the opposite direction on Paterson Road can enter Orchard Road by turning right. There are also a number of other roads leading into Orchard Road. Orchard Road is one-way heading south and leads into Bras Basah Road which is a one-way street heading south.

<text>Söyembikä (also spelled &quot;Söyenbikä, Sujumbike,&quot; pronounced ; Cyrillic: &quot;Сөембикә&quot;) (1516 – after 1554) was a Nogai ruler, &quot;xanbikä&quot;. She served as regent of Kazan during the minority of her son from 1549 until 1551.

==Life==
She was the daughter of Nogay nobleman Yosıf bäk and the wife of Canğäli (1533–35), Safagäräy (1536–49) and Şahğäli (after 1553). In 1549, she became regent during the minority of her son, Kazan khan Ütämeşgäräy.

In 1551, after the first partial conquest of the Khanate of Kazan by Ivan the Terrible she was forcibly moved to Moscow with her son and later married to Şahğäli, the Russia-imposed khan of the Qasim and Kazan Tatars.

===Suicide legend===
She is a national hero of Tatarstan. Her name is associated first of all with Söyembikä Tower, that Ivan the Terrible wanted to marry her, so she agreed that if he built her a tower made with seven tiers (one for each day of the week) then she would marry him. Ivan the Terrible supposedly finished the tower within the week, so Söyembikä went up to the top of the tower and after looking out at her beautiful home of Kazan she became so overwhelmed with emotion for her people that she couldn&#x27;t bear to marry the tsar and jumped off. However, the true date of her death, and her gravesite, remains unknown.

<doc id="977007" wikidata="Q429684" url="?curid=977007" title="Church of Scotland Act 1921">
<text>The Church of Scotland Act 1921 is an Act of the British Parliament. The purpose of the Act was to settle centuries of dispute between the British Parliament and the Church of Scotland over the Church&#x27;s independence in spiritual matters. The passing of the Act saw the British Parliament recognise the Church&#x27;s independence in spiritual matters, by giving legal recognition to the Articles Declaratory.

==Background==
The Church of Scotland was founded as a Presbyterian church in 1560 during the Scottish Reformation since when it has held that the civil power had no authority over it, in spiritual matters. The question of church establishment and in what sense the Church of Scotland was an &quot;Established church&quot; led to conflicts with successive rulers from the Stuart monarchs onward. Monarchs tended to prefer the model of the Church of England, where the Crown had the power to appoint bishops, and various other forms of power over the Church (although it was not reduced to the complete state control found in Scandinavia).

The particular crisis came over the question of &quot;lay patrons&quot;, who had the right to &quot;present&quot;
(appoint) a minister. This was abolished in 1690 at the time of the Glorious Revolution
but restored in 1712. In theory the congregation could accept or reject a candidate, but in
practice this often meant little. By the late 18th century the Church was divided into the Moderate
and Evangelical parties. These differed especially on the question of lay patronage,
which the Evangelicals rejected. Underlying this was the split between the Calvinism of the
Evangelicals and the more Enlightenment tone of the Moderates.

In 1833 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland passed a Veto Act giving congregations
the clear power of veto. However the courts generally upheld the rights of lay patrons, and
thus the issue became one of Church and State. In 1843 a large part of the Church seceded as
the Free Church of Scotland — not rejecting Establishment in principle, but only its
present form. This secession was known as the Disruption.

In the early 20th century a reunion between the Church of Scotland and the United Free
Church seemed possible. To overcome problems (including legal problems which had followed
the earlier merger of the Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church) the Church
of Scotland Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5 c. 29) was passed. This noted that the General
Assembly had passed Declaratory Articles. These were declared to be lawful. (Thus,
they were not &quot;created&quot; by parliament.) It was declared that &quot;no limitation of the
liberty, rights, and powers in matters spiritual therein set forth shall be derived from
any statute or law affecting the Church of Scotland in matters spiritual at present
in force; it being hereby declared that in all questions of construction the Declaratory Articles shall prevail...&quot; (s. 1).

==Current position==
This has created a new and revised relationship between the Church and the State.
The Church of Scotland remains the National Church, but it has complete independence in spiritual questions and appointments. After the passing of the act, a church historian proclaimed: &quot;No Church in Christendom can so fully claim to be at once national and free as the Church of Scotland today.&quot;

When legislating for Scotland since the passing of the Act, the British Parliament has to consider whether the Church of Scotland is to be excluded from the provisions. Examples included the passing of the Scotland Act 1998, which had to be worded not to infringe on the independence of the Church, and prevent the Scottish Parliament repealing the Church of Scotland Act. Also during the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998, an amendment was proposed when the bill was passing through the House of Lords to exclude the Church of Scotland from some of the provisions. In the end, this was not deemed necessary.

In 2005, the House of Lords finally decided the case &quot;Percy (AP) v Church of Scotland Board of National Mission&quot; [2005] UKHL 73 , ruling that, despite the 1921 Act, a ministerial appointment created a contract subject to the jurisdiction of the civil courts and employment tribunals.

<doc id="977013" wikidata="Q1291512" url="?curid=977013" title="Japanese battleship Nagato">
<text>was a super-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Completed in 1920 as the lead ship of her class, she carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. The ship was modernized in 1934–1936 with improvements to her armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style. &quot;Nagato&quot; briefly participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and was the flagship of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during the attack on Pearl Harbor. She covered the withdrawal of the attacking ships and did not participate in the attack itself.

Other than participating in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, where she did not see combat, the ship spent most of the first two years of the Pacific War training in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but did not see any combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. &quot;Nagato&quot; did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. &quot;Nagato&quot; was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. She was attacked in July 1945 as part of the American campaign to destroy the IJN&#x27;s last remaining capital ships, but was only slightly damaged and went on to be the only Japanese battleship to have survived World War II. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second.

==Description==
&quot;Nagato&quot; had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced at standard load and at full load. Her crew consisted of 1,333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1,368 in 1935. The crew totaled around 1,734 men in 1944.

In 1930, &quot;Nagato&quot;″s bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a head sea. This increased her overall length by to . During her 1934–1936 reconstruction, the ship&#x27;s stern was lengthened by to improve her speed and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a pagoda mast. She was given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draft to . Her displacement increased over to at deep load. The ship&#x27;s metacentric height at deep load was . In November 1944, the tops of &quot;Nagato&quot;″s mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the effective arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.

===Propulsion===

&quot;Nagato&quot; was equipped with four Gihon geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 21 Kampon water-tube boilers; 15 of these were oil-fired while the remaining half-dozen consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ship could carry of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her sea trials, reaching at .

Funnel smoke would often choke and blind crewmen on the bridge and in the fire-control systems so a &quot;fingernail&quot;-shaped deflector was installed on the fore funnel in 1922 to direct the exhaust away from them. It was less than effective and the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort during a refit in 1924. That funnel was eliminated during the ship&#x27;s 1930s reconstruction when all of her boilers were replaced by ten oil-fired Kampon boilers, which had a working pressure of and temperature of . In addition her turbines were replaced by lighter, more modern, units. When &quot;Nagato&quot; conducted her post-reconstruction trials, she reached a speed of with . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges, which increased her capacity to and thus her range to at 16 knots.

===Armament===

&quot;Nagato&quot;″s eight 45-caliber 41-centimeter (16 inch) guns were mounted in two pairs of twin-gun, superfiring turrets fore and aft. Numbered one through four from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The turrets aboard the &quot;Nagato&quot;-class ships were replaced in the mid-1930s with the turrets stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the turrets had been modified to increase their range of elevation to –3 to +43 degrees, which increased the gun&#x27;s maximum range from .

The ship&#x27;s secondary armament of twenty 50-caliber 14-centimeter guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure. The manually operated guns had a maximum range of and fired at a rate of six to 10 rounds per minute. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four 40-caliber 3rd Year Type three-inch AA guns in single mounts. The high-angle guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. The ship was also fitted with eight torpedo tubes, four on each broadside, two above water and two submerged.
Around 1926, the four above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast. They were replaced by eight 40-caliber 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose (DP) guns in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two twin-gun mounts for license-built Vickers two-pounder light AA guns were also added to the ship that same year. These guns had a maximum elevation of +80 degrees which gave them a ceiling of . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

When the ship was reconstructed in 1934–1936, the remaining torpedo tubes and the two forward 14 cm (-inch) guns were removed from the hull. The remaining 14 cm guns had their elevation increased to +35 degrees which increased their range to . An unknown number of license-built Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun in twin mounts were added. The maximum range of these guns was , but the effective range against aircraft was . The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.

The unsatisfactory two-pounders were replaced in 1939 by twenty license-built Type 96 Hotchkiss Type 96 light AA guns in a mixture of twin-gun and single mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. These 25 mm guns had an effective range of , and an effective ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines. Additional Type 96 guns were installed during the war; on 10 July 1944, the ship was reported to have 98 guns on board. An additional 30 guns were added during a refit in Yokosuka in November. Two more twin 12.7 cm (5 inch) gun mounts were added at the same time abreast the funnel and her 14 cm guns were removed as she was by then a floating anti-aircraft battery.

===Armor===
The ship&#x27;s waterline armor belt was thick and tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge; above it was a strake of armor. The main deck armor was while the lower deck was thick. The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 305 mm on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick, while the casemates of the 1 guns were protected by armor plates. The sides of the conning tower were thick.

The new 41 cm turrets installed during &quot;Nagato&quot;″s reconstruction were more heavily armored than the original ones. Face armor was increased to , the sides to , and the roof to . The armor over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and on the upper armored deck. These additions increased the weight of the ship&#x27;s armor to , 32.6 percent of her displacement. In early 1941, as a preparation for war, &quot;Nagato&quot;″s barbette armor was reinforced with armor plates above the main deck and plates below it.

===Fire control and sensors===
When completed in 1920, the ship was fitted with a rangefinder in the forward superstructure; and anti-aircraft rangefinders were added in May 1921 and 1923, respectively. The rangefinders in the second and third turrets were replaced by 10-meter units in 1932–1933.

&quot;Nagato&quot; was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; no provision was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire-control director was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard the ship in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 34. A new anti-aircraft director called the Type 94 that was used to control the 127 mm AA guns was introduced in 1937, although when &quot;Nagato&quot; received hers is unknown. The Type 96 AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.

While in drydock in May 1943, a Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. On 27 June 1944, two Type 22 surface search radars were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radars were fitted on her mainmast.

===Aircraft===
&quot;Nagato&quot; was fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in August 1925. Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata and Heinkel HD 25 floatplanes were tested from it before it was removed early the following year. An additional boom was added to the mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y now assigned to the ship. A Hansa-Brandenburg W.33 floatplane was tested aboard &quot;Nagato&quot; that same year. A catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3 in mid-1933, a collapsible crane was installed in a portside sponson, and the ship was equipped to operate two or three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship now operated Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft, such as the one Kawanishi E7K that was added in 1939–1940. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Nagato&quot;, named for Nagato Province, was ordered on 12 May 1916 and laid down at the Kure Naval Arsenal on 28 August 1917 as the lead ship of her class. She was launched on 9 November 1919 by Admiral Katō Tomosaburō, completed on 15 November 1920 and commissioned 10 days later with Captain Nobutaro Iida in command. &quot;Nagato&quot; was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sōjirō Tochinai. On 13 February 1921, the ship was inspected by the Crown Prince, Hirohito. Captain Kanari Kabayama relieved Iida on 1 December 1921. The ship hosted Marshal Joseph Joffre on 18 February 1922 and Edward, Prince of Wales, and his aide-de-camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten on 12 April during the prince&#x27;s visit to Japan.

After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, &quot;Nagato&quot; loaded supplies from Kyushu for the victims on 4 September. Together with her sister ship , she sank the hulk of the obsolete battleship on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in Tokyo Bay in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was transferred to the reserve of the 1st Division on 1 December and became a gunnery training ship. In August 1925, aircraft handling and take-off tests were conducted aboard &quot;Nagato&quot;. She was reassigned as the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 1 December, flying the flag of Admiral Keisuke Okada. Captain Kiyoshi Hasegawa assumed command of the ship on 1 December 1926.

&quot;Nagato&quot; was again placed in reserve on 1 December 1931 and her anti-aircraft armament was upgraded the following year. In August 1933 the ship participated in fleet maneuvers north of the Marshall Islands and she began her first modernization on 1 April 1934. This was completed on 31 January 1936 and &quot;Nagato&quot; was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. During the attempted coup d&#x27;état on 26 February by disgruntled Army officers, the ship was deployed in Tokyo Bay and some of her sailors were landed in support of the government. In August, she transported 1,749 men of the 43rd Infantry Regiment of the 11th Infantry Division from Shikoku to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day. &quot;Nagato&quot; became a training ship on 1 December until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940. She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war.

===World War II===

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto issued the code phrase &quot;Niitaka yama nobore&quot; (Climb Mount Niitaka) on 2 December 1941 from &quot;Nagato&quot; at anchor at Hashirajima to signal the 1st Air Fleet (&quot;Kido Butai&quot;) in the North Pacific to proceed with its attack on Pearl Harbor. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, she sortied for the Bonin Islands, along with &quot;Mutsu&quot;, the battleships , , , of Battleship Division 2, and the light carrier as distant cover for the withdrawal of the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. Yamamoto transferred his flag to the new battleship on 12 February 1942. &quot;Nagato&quot; was briefly refitted 15 March – 9 April at Kure Naval Arsenal.

In June 1942 &quot;Nagato&quot;, commanded by Captain Hideo Yano, was assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Mutsu&quot;, &quot;Hosho&quot;, the light cruiser , nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers of the 1st Air Fleet on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and &quot;Nagato&quot; saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the 1st Air Fleet on 6 June, survivors from the aircraft carrier were transferred to &quot;Nagato&quot;. On 14 July, the ship was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and she became the flagship of the 1st Fleet. Yano was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and he was replaced by Captain Yonejiro Hisamune nine days later. &quot;Nagato&quot; remained in Japanese waters training until August 1943. On 2 August Captain Mikio Hayakawa assumed command of the ship.

That month, &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Fusō&quot; and the escort carrier , escorted by two heavy cruisers and five destroyers transferred to Truk in the Caroline Islands. In response to the carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, &quot;Nagato&quot; and much of the fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested an attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, &quot;Nagato&quot; and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok to be in a position to intercept any such attack. The fleet arrived on 19 October, departed four days later, and arrived back at Truk on 26 October. Hayakawa was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and he was relieved on 25 December by Captain Yuji Kobe.
On 1 February 1944, &quot;Nagato&quot; departed Truk with &quot;Fusō&quot; to avoid an American air raid, and arrived at Palau on 4 February. They departed on 16 February to escape another air raid. The ships arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island, near Singapore, and the ship became the flagship of Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, commander of Battleship Division 1, on 25 February, until he transferred his flag to &quot;Yamato&quot; on 5 May. Aside from a brief refit at Singapore, the ship remained at Lingga training until 11 May when she was transferred to Tawi-Tawi on 12 May. The division was now assigned to the 1st Mobile Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa.

On 10 June, Battleship Division 1 departed Tawi-Tawi for Batjan in preparation for Operation Kon, a planned counterattack against the American invasion of Biak. Three days later, when Admiral Soemu Toyoda, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, was notified of American attacks on Saipan, Operation Kon was canceled and Ugaki&#x27;s force was diverted to the Mariana Islands. The battleships rendezvoused with Ozawa&#x27;s main force on 16 June. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Nagato&quot; escorted the aircraft carriers , and the light carrier . She fired 41 cm Type 3 &quot;Sankaidan&quot; incendiary anti-aircraft shrapnel shells at aircraft from the light carrier that were attacking &quot;Jun&#x27;yō&quot; and claimed to have shot down two Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers. The ship was strafed by American aircraft during the battle, but was not damaged and suffered no casualties. During the battle &quot;Nagato&quot; rescued survivors from &quot;Hiyō&quot; that were transferred to the carrier once the ship reached Okinawa on 22 June. She continued on to Kure where she was refitted with additional radars and light AA guns. Undocked on 8 July, &quot;Nagato&quot; loaded a regiment of the 28th Infantry Division the following day and delivered them to Okinawa on 11 July. She arrived at Lingga via Manila on 20 July.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
Kobe was promoted to rear admiral on 15 October. Three days later, &quot;Nagato&quot; sailed for Brunei Bay, Borneo, to join the main Japanese fleet in preparation for &quot;Operation &quot;Sho&quot;-1&quot;, the counterattack planned against the American landings at Leyte. The Japanese plan called for Ozawa&#x27;s carrier forces to lure the American carrier fleets north of Leyte so that Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s 1st Diversion Force (also known as the Center Force) could enter Leyte Gulf and destroy American forces landing on the island. &quot;Nagato&quot;, together with the rest of Kurita&#x27;s force, departed Brunei for the Philippines on 22 October.

In the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, &quot;Nagato&quot; was attacked by multiple waves of American dive bombers and fighters. At 14:16 she was hit by two bombs dropped by planes from the fleet carrier and the light carrier . The first bomb disabled five of her casemate guns, jammed one of her Type 89 gun mounts, and damaged the air intake to No. 1 boiler room, immobilizing one propeller shaft for 24 minutes until the boiler was put back online. Damage from the second bomb is unknown. The two bombs killed 52 men between them; the number of wounded is not known.
On the morning of 25 October, the 1st Diversion Force passed through the San Bernardino Strait and headed for Leyte Gulf to attack the American forces supporting the invasion. In the Battle off Samar, &quot;Nagato&quot; engaged the escort carriers and destroyers of Task Group 77.4.3, codenamed &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. At 06:01 she opened fire on three escort carriers, the first time she had ever fired her guns at an enemy ship, but missed. At 06:54 the destroyer fired a spread of torpedoes at the fast battleship ; the torpedoes missed &quot;Haruna&quot; and headed for &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Nagato&quot; which were on a parallel course. The two battleships were forced 10 miles (16 km) away from the engagement before the torpedoes ran out of fuel. Turning back, &quot;Nagato&quot; engaged the American escort carriers and their screening ships, claiming to have damaged one cruiser with forty-five 410 mm and ninety-two 14 cm shells. The ineffectiveness of her shooting was the result of the poor visibility caused by numerous rain squalls and by smoke screens laid by the defending escorts. At 09:10 Kurita ordered his ships to break off the engagement and head north. At 10:20 he ordered the fleet south once more, but as they came under increasingly severe air attack he ordered a retreat again at 12:36. At 12:43 &quot;Nagato&quot; was hit in the bow by two bombs, but the damage was not severe. Four gunners were washed overboard at 16:56 as the ship made a sharp turn to avoid dive-bomber attacks; a destroyer was detached to rescue them, but they could not be found. As it retreated back to Brunei on 26 October, the Japanese fleet came under repeated air attacks. &quot;Nagato&quot; and &quot;Yamato&quot; used &quot;Sankaidan&quot; shells against them and claimed to have shot down several bombers. Over the course of the last two days she fired ninety-nine 410 mm and six hundred fifty-three 14 cm shells, suffering 38 crewmen killed and 105 wounded during the same time.

====Final days of the war====
On 15 November the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3 of the 2nd Fleet. After an aerial attack at Brunei on 16 November, &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Yamato&quot;, and the fast battleship left the following day, bound for Kure. En route, &quot;Kongō&quot; and one of the escorting destroyers were sunk by on 21 November. On 25 November, she arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, for repairs. Lack of fuel and materials meant that she could not be brought back into service and she was turned into a floating anti-aircraft battery. Her funnel and mainmast were removed to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns, which were increased by two Type 89 mounts and nine triple Type 96 gun mounts. Her forward secondary guns were removed in compensation. Captain Kiyomi Shibuya relieved Kobe in command of &quot;Nagato&quot; on 25 November. Battleship Division 3 was disbanded on 1 January 1945 and the ship was reassigned to Battleship Division 1. That formation was disbanded on 10 February and she was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District as a coastal defense ship. alongside a pier, a coal-burning donkey boiler was installed on the pier for heating and cooking purposes and a converted submarine chaser was positioned alongside to provide steam and electricity; her anti-aircraft guns lacked full power and were only partially operational. On 20 April, &quot;Nagato&quot; was reduced to reserve and retired Rear Admiral Miki Otsuka assumed command a week later.

In June 1945, all of her secondary guns and about half of her anti-aircraft armament was moved ashore, together with her rangefinders and searchlights. Her crew was accordingly reduced to less than 1,000 officers and enlisted men. On 18 July 1945, the heavily camouflaged ship was attacked by fighter bombers and torpedo bombers from five American carriers as part of Admiral William Halsey Jr.&#x27;s campaign to destroy the IJN&#x27;s last surviving capital ships. &quot;Nagato&quot; was hit by two bombs, the first bomb struck the bridge and killed Otsuka, the executive officer, and twelve sailors when it detonated upon hitting the roof of the conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck aft of the mainmast and detonated when it hit No. 3 barbette. It failed to damage the barbette or the turret above it, but blew a hole nearly in diameter in the deck above the officer&#x27;s lounge, killing 21 men and damaging four Type 96 guns on the deck above. A dud rocket of uncertain size hit the ship&#x27;s fantail, but failed to do any significant damage. To convince the Americans that &quot;Nagato&quot; had been badly damaged by the attack, her damage was left unrepaired and some of her ballast tanks were pumped full of seawater to make her sit deeper in the water as if she had sunk to the harbor bottom.
Captain Shuichi Sugino was appointed as &quot;Nagato&quot;″s new captain on 24 July, but he was unable to take up his appointment until 20 August. Retired Rear Admiral Masamichi Ikeguchi was assigned as the ship&#x27;s interim captain until Sugino arrived. The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1/2 August that a large convoy was approaching Sagami Bay and &quot;Nagato&quot; was ordered to attack immediately. The ship was totally unprepared for any attack, but Ikeguchi began the necessary preparations. The water in the ballast compartments was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16-inch guns. The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning, but no order to attack ever came as it had been a false alarm. Sailors from the battleship , Underwater Demolition Team 18, and the high-speed transport secured the battleship on 30 August after the occupation began and Captain Thomas J. Flynn, executive officer of the &quot;Iowa&quot;, assumed command. By the time the war ended, &quot;Nagato&quot; was the only Japanese battleship still afloat. She was stricken from the Navy List on 15 September.

==After the war==

The ship was selected to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. In mid-March, &quot;Nagato&quot; departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok under the command of Captain W. J. Whipple, with an American crew of about 180 men supplementing her Japanese crew. The ship was only capable of a speed of from her two operating propeller shafts. Her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July 1945, and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. Her consort, the light cruiser , broke down on 28 March and &quot;Nagato&quot; attempted to take her in tow, but one of her boilers malfunctioned and the ship ran out of fuel in bad weather. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived on 30 March. Towed at a speed of , the ship reached Eniwetok on 4 April where she received temporary repairs. On her trip to Bikini in May, &quot;Nagato&quot; reached .
Operation Crossroads began with the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July; she was from ground zero and was only lightly damaged. A skeleton crew boarded &quot;Nagato&quot; to assess the damage and prepare her for the next test on 25 July. As a test, they operated one of her boilers for 36 hours without any problems. For Test Baker, an underwater explosion, the ship was positioned from ground zero. &quot;Nagato&quot; rode out the tsunami from the explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized and sank during the night of 29/30 July.

The wreck is upside down and her most prominent features are her four propellers, at a depth of below the surface. She has become a scuba diving destination in recent years and &quot;The Times&quot; named &quot;Nagato&quot; as one of the top ten wreck diving sites in the world in 2007.

<text>The waved albatross (Phoebastria irrorata), also known as Galapagos albatross, is one of three species of the family Diomedeidae that occur in the tropics. When they forage, they follow a straight path to a single site off the coast of Peru, about to the east. During the non-breeding season, these birds reside primarily on the Ecuadorian and Peruvian coasts.

==Taxonomy==
Waved albatrosses are a species of albatross belonging to family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils of the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates.

Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.

==Etymology==
The waved albatross derives its name from the wave-like pattern of the feathers on adult birds.

==Description==
These are medium-sized albatrosses, measuring in length with a wingspan of . They range between in mass, with males averaging significantly heavier than females. They are distinctive for their yellowish-cream neck and head, which contrasts with their mostly brownish bodies. Even more distinctive is the very long, bright yellow bill, which looks disproportionately large in comparison to the relatively small head and long, slender neck. They also have chestnut brown upper parts and underparts, except for the breast, with fine barring, a little coarser on the rump. They have brown upper-wings, back, and tail, along with a whitish breast and underwings. Their axillaries are brown. Finally they have bluish feet. Juveniles are similar to adults except for more white on their head. Chicks have brown fluffy feathers. The lifespan of this species may reach 40 to 45 years.

==Range==
The waved albatross breeds primarily on Española Island in the Galápagos archipelago; however, there have been sightings of non-breeders and therefore possible small numbers, around 10 to 20, of breeders on Genovesa Island and Isla de la Plata. During non-breeding season they will shift to the east and southeast to the continental shelf region off the coast of Peru and Ecuador. Sometimes they are seen in Colombia.

==Behavior==

===Feeding===
The primary food sources of the waved albatross are fish, squid, and crustaceans, as well as smaller birds. But they have also been observed to scavenge for other food sources, including the regurgitated food of other birds. When foraging, the waved albatross finds places in the ocean where prey will be near this surface; this is the most effective way for the albatross to get its food. The waved albatrosses will forage away from the place where the chicks are nesting to get food for them.

===Breeding===
The nests are built on areas of lava with boulders and sparse vegetation, or thick brush. The courtship of the waved albatross is a very elusive and spectacular sight. It includes: rapid bill circling and bowing, beak clacking, and an upraised bill to make a whoo hoo sound. The eggs are laid between April and June and incubated for two months. When the eggs hatch, the chicks stay together in small nurseries while the parents go out to the sea for hunting. When the parents return, they may feed the chicks up to of oil. The young reach adult size by December and leave the colony by January. The partners remain mates until one of the partners dies.

===Flight===

Waved albatross are spectacular flyers, perhaps even the most famous. They can fly for hours without stalling and they do this by dynamic soaring. The wind speed near the surface of the sea is much lower than about in the air. The waved albatross uses this to its advantage by gliding at speed into the wind. As the waved albatross glides higher it loses most of its ground speed because it is gliding into a wind of a higher speed. However, its air speed does not fall, enabling it to glide continuously. Waved albatrosses do have difficulty in landing because of their high stalling speed, and in taking off because of their weight and wing span. To make it easier they sometimes take off from cliffs that are somewhat inland rather than beside the coast.

==Conservation==

The population of waved albatrosses on the Galápagos is protected by national park personnel, and the island is also categorized as a World Heritage Site. But limited range, bycatch by longline fishing, disturbance via tourism, disease, and the effects of illegal fishing in the nearby waters place them in considerable jeopardy. Longline fishing in particular seems to be having a severe impact on the species, the conservation status of which was upgraded from near threatened to vulnerable by the IUCN in 2000.

Despite there still being some 34,700 adult birds in 2001, their numbers have apparently started to decrease at an unknown rate more recently, probably due to longline fishing which also upsets the sex ratio (males being killed more frequently). As the current situation makes the population highly vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse to extinction, it was uplisted to critically endangered status in the 2007 IUCN Red List.

The population of 34,700 adult birds was based on a 2001 estimate; however in 1970 and 1971 there were an estimated 24,000, and 1994 saw between 31,200 and 36,400. This species has an occurrence range of , and a breeding range of .

<doc id="977032" wikidata="Q1813237" url="?curid=977032" title="Japanese battleship Mutsu">
<text>was the second and last dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) at the end of World War I. In 1923 she carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake. The ship was modernized in 1934–1936 with improvements to her armour and machinery, and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style.

Other than participating in the Battle of Midway and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in 1942, where she did not see any significant combat, &quot;Mutsu&quot; spent most of the first year of the Pacific War in training. She returned to Japan in early 1943. That June, one of her aft magazines detonated while she was at anchor, sinking the ship with the loss of 1,121 crew and visitors. The IJN investigation into the cause of her loss concluded that it was the work of a disgruntled crew member. The navy dispersed the survivors in an attempt to conceal the sinking in the interest of morale in Japan. Much of the wreck was scrapped after the war, but some artefacts and relics are on display in Japan, and a small portion of the ship remains where she was sunk.

==Description==
&quot;Mutsu&quot; had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. She had a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced at standard load and at full load. Her crew consisted of 1,333 officers and enlisted men as built and 1,368 in 1935. The crew totaled around 1,475 men in 1942.

In 1927, &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s bow was remodeled to reduce the amount of spray produced when steaming into a head sea. This increased her overall length by to . During her 1934–1936 reconstruction, the ship&#x27;s stern was lengthened by to improve her speed, and her forward superstructure was rebuilt into a pagoda mast. She was given torpedo bulges to improve her underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour and equipment. These changes increased her overall length to , her beam to and her draught to . Her displacement increased over to at deep load.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Mutsu&quot; was equipped with four Gihon geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , using steam provided by 21 Kampon water-tube boilers; 15 of these were oil-fired, and the remaining half-dozen consumed a mixture of coal and oil. The ship had a stowage capacity of of coal and of fuel oil, giving her a range of at a speed of . The ship exceeded her designed speed of during her sea trials, reaching at .

During a refit in 1924 the fore funnel was rebuilt in a serpentine shape in an unsuccessful effort to prevent smoke interference with the bridge and fire-control systems. That funnel was eliminated during the ship&#x27;s 1930s reconstruction when all of her existing boilers were replaced by ten lighter and more powerful oil-fired Kampon boilers, which had working pressures of and temperatures of . In addition her turbines were replaced by lighter, more modern, units. When &quot;Mutsu&quot; conducted her post-reconstruction trials, she reached a speed of with . Additional fuel oil was stored in the bottoms of the newly added torpedo bulges, which increased her capacity to and thus her range to at 16 knots.

===Armament===
&quot;Mutsu&quot;″s eight 45-caliber  guns were mounted in two pairs of twin-gun, superfiring turrets fore and aft. Numbered one to four from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets gave the guns an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. A special Type 3 &quot;Sankaidan&quot; incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti-aircraft use. The turrets aboard the &quot;Nagato&quot;-class ships were replaced in the mid-1930s using those stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the turrets were modified to increase their range of elevation to −3 degrees to +43 degrees, which increased the guns&#x27; maximum range from .

The ship&#x27;s secondary armament of twenty 50-calibre guns was mounted in casemates on the upper sides of the hull and in the superstructure. The manually operated guns had a maximum range of and fired at a rate of six to ten rounds per minute. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by four 40-calibre 8-centimetre (3 in) 3rd Year Type AA guns in single mounts. These guns had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute. The ship was also fitted with eight torpedo tubes, four on each broadside, two above water and two submerged.
Around 1926, the four above-water torpedo tubes were removed and the ship received three additional 76 mm AA guns that were situated around the base of the foremast. The 76 mm AA guns were replaced by eight 40-calibre  dual-purpose guns in 1932, fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin-gun mounts. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute. Two twin-gun mounts for licence-built Vickers 2-pounder () &quot;pom-pom&quot; light AA guns were also added to the ship in 1932. These guns had a maximum elevation of +80 degrees, which gave them a ceiling of . They had a maximum rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute.

The two-pounders were replaced by 1941 by 20 licence-built Hotchkiss 25 mm (1 in) Type 96 light AA guns in five twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. These guns had an effective range of , and a ceiling of at an elevation of 85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines.

===Armour===
The ship&#x27;s waterline armour belt was thick and tapered to a thickness of at its bottom edge; above it was a strake of armour. The main deck armour was while the lower deck was thick. The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 305 mm on the face, on the sides, and on the roof. The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armour 305 mm thick, and the casemates of the 140 mm guns were protected by 25 mm armour plates. The sides of the conning tower were thick.

The new 41 cm turrets installed during &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s reconstruction were more heavily armoured than the original ones. Face armour was increased to , the sides to , and the roof to . The armour over the machinery and magazines was increased by 38 mm on the upper deck and 25 mm on the upper armoured deck. These additions increased the weight of the ship&#x27;s armour to , 32.6 percent of her displacement. In early 1941, in preparation for war, &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s barbette armour was reinforced with armour plates above the main deck and plates below it.

===Aircraft===
&quot;Mutsu&quot; had an additional boom added to the mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was installed in a port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.

===Fire control and sensors===
The ship was fitted with a rangefinder in the forward superstructure. Additional and anti-aircraft rangefinders were also fitted, although the date is unknown. The rangefinders in No. 2 and 3 turrets were replaced by 10-metre units in 1932–33.

&quot;Mutsu&quot; was initially fitted with a Type 13 fire-control system derived from Vickers equipment received during World War I, but this was replaced by an improved Type 14 system around 1925. It controlled the main and secondary guns; no provision was made for anti-aircraft fire until the Type 31 fire-control director was introduced in 1932. A modified Type 14 fire-control system was tested aboard her sister ship in 1935 and later approved for service as the Type 94. A new anti-aircraft director, also called the Type 94, used to control the 127 mm AA guns, was introduced in 1937, although when &quot;Mutsu&quot; received hers is unknown. The 25 mm AA guns were controlled by a Type 95 director that was also introduced in 1937.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Mutsu&quot;, named for Mutsu Province, was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 June 1918 and launched on 31 May 1920. Funding for the ship had partly come from donations from schoolchildren. While &quot;Mutsu&quot; was still fitting out, the American government called a conference in Washington, D.C. late in 1921 to forestall the expensive naval arms race that was developing between the United States, the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan. The Washington Naval Conference convened on 12 November and the Americans proposed to scrap virtually every capital ship under construction or being fitted out by the participating nations. &quot;Mutsu&quot; was specifically listed among those to be scrapped even though she had been commissioned a few weeks earlier. This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegates; they agreed to a compromise that allowed them to keep &quot;Mutsu&quot; in exchange for scrapping the obsolete dreadnought , with a similar arrangement for several American dreadnoughts that were fitting out. &quot;Mutsu&quot; was commissioned on 24 October 1921 with Captain Shizen Komaki in command. Captain Seiichi Kurose assumed command on 18 November and the ship was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December. &quot;Mutsu&quot; hosted Edward, Prince of Wales, and his aide-de-camp and second cousin, Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten, on 12 April 1922 during the prince&#x27;s visit to Japan.

On 4 September 1923, &quot;Mutsu&quot; loaded supplies at Uchinoura Bay, Kyushu, for the victims of the Great Kantō earthquake. With her sister &quot;Nagato&quot;, she sank the hulk of the obsolete battleship on 7 September 1924 during gunnery practice in Tokyo Bay, in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty. Captain Mitsumasa Yonai, later Prime Minister of Japan, assumed command on 10 November. The ship was transferred to the reserve on 1 December 1925. &quot;Mutsu&quot; served as flagship of Emperor Hirohito during the 1927 naval manoeuvres and fleet review. Captain Zengo Yoshida relieved Captain Teikichi Hori on 10 December 1928. On 29 March 1929, the ship was assigned to Battleship Division 3, together with three light cruisers.

&quot;Mutsu&quot;″s anti-aircraft armament was upgraded during 1932. Upon completion, she was assigned to Battleship Division 1 of the 1st Fleet, and again served as the Emperor&#x27;s flagship during the annual maneuvers and fleet review in 1933. The ship was placed in reserve on 15 November and began her lengthy reconstruction. This was completed on 30 September 1936 and &quot;Mutsu&quot; rejoined the 1st Battleship Division on 1 December 1936. In August 1937, she transported 2,000 men of the 11th Infantry Division to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her seaplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day. On 15 November 1938, Captain Aritomo Gotō assumed command of the ship. &quot;Mutsu&quot; was placed in reserve from 15 December 1938 to 15 November 1939. She was refitted in early 1941 in preparation for war; as part of this work, she was fitted with external degaussing coils and additional armour for her barbettes.

===World War II===

During the war &quot;Mutsu&quot; saw limited action, spending much of her time in home waters. On 8 December 1941, she sortied for the Bonin Islands, along with &quot;Nagato&quot;, the battleships , , , and of Battleship Division 2, and the light carrier as distant support for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 18 January 1942, &quot;Mutsu&quot; towed the obsolete armoured cruiser as a target for the new battleship , which promptly sank &quot;Nisshin&quot;.

In June 1942 &quot;Mutsu&quot;, commanded by Rear Admiral Gunji Kogure, was assigned to the main body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Hōshō&quot;, the light cruiser , nine destroyers, and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure the American forces west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but the American forces withdrew and &quot;Mutsu&quot; saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the striking force on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to &quot;Mutsu&quot;. She arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June.

On 14 July, &quot;Mutsu&quot; was transferred to Battleship Division 2 and then to the advance force of the 2nd Fleet on 9 August. Two days later, the ship departed Yokosuka accompanied by the cruisers , , , , , and , the seaplane tender , and escorting destroyers to support operations during the Guadalcanal Campaign. They arrived at Truk on 17 August. On 20 August, while sailing from Truk to rendezvous with the main body of the 3rd Fleet, &quot;Mutsu&quot;, the heavy cruiser &quot;Atago&quot;, and escorting destroyers unsuccessfully attempted to locate the escort carrier in response to a flying boat detecting the American ship.

During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 27 August, &quot;Mutsu&quot;, assigned to the support force, fired four shells at enemy reconnaissance aircraft, the first and only time her guns were fired in anger during the war. &quot;Mutsu&quot; returned to Truk on 2 September; a group of skilled AA gunnery officers and men were detached to serve as instructors to ground-based naval anti-aircraft gunners stationed in Rabaul. During October &quot;Mutsu&quot; off-loaded surplus fuel oil to the fleet oil tanker &quot;Kenyo Maru&quot;, allowing the tanker to refuel other ships involved in Guadalcanal operations. On 7 January 1943, &quot;Mutsu&quot; departed from Truk for Japan via Saipan, accompanied by the carrier , the heavy cruiser and four destroyers. &quot;Mutsu&quot; left Hashirajima for Kure on 13 April, where she prepared to sortie to reinforce the Japanese garrisons in the Aleutian Islands in response to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. The operation was cancelled the next day and the ship resumed training.

===Loss===
On 8 June 1943, &quot;Mutsu&quot; was moored in the Hashirajima fleet anchorage, with 113 flying cadets and 40 instructors from the Tsuchiura Naval Air Group aboard for familiarisation. At 12:13 the magazine of her No. 3 turret exploded, destroying the adjacent structure of the ship and cutting her in two. A massive influx of water into the machinery spaces caused the forward section of the ship to capsize to starboard and sink almost immediately. The stern section upended and remained floating until about 02:00 hours on 9 June before sinking, coming to rest a few hundred feet south of the main wreck at coordinates .

The nearby &quot;Fusō&quot; immediately launched two boats which, together with the destroyers and and the cruisers and , rescued 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard &quot;Mutsu&quot;; 1,121 men were killed in the explosion. Only 13 of the visiting aviators were among the survivors.

After the explosion, as the rescue operations commenced, the fleet was alerted and the area was searched for Allied submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the potential damage to morale from the loss of a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s destruction was declared a state secret. Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi&#x27;s body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Koro Oono, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where most were killed in 1944 during the battle for the island.

At the time of the explosion, &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s magazine contained some 16-inch Type 3 &quot;Sanshikidan&quot; incendiary shrapnel anti-aircraft shells, which had caused a fire at the Sagami arsenal several years earlier due to improper storage. Because they might have been the cause of the explosion, the minister of the navy, Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, immediately ordered the removal of Type 3 shells from all IJN ships carrying them, until the conclusion of the investigation into the loss.

==Investigation into the loss==
A commission led by Admiral Kōichi Shiozawa was convened three days after the sinking to investigate the loss. The commission considered several possible causes:
* Sabotage by enemy secret agents. Given the heavy security at the anchorage and lack of claims of responsibility by the Allies, this could be discounted.
* Sabotage by a disgruntled crewman. While no individual was named in the commission&#x27;s final report, its conclusion was that the cause of the explosion was most likely a crewman in No. 3 turret who had recently been accused of theft and was believed to be suicidal.
* A midget or fleet submarine attack. Extensive searches immediately following the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made no attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.
* Accidental explosion within a magazine. While the &quot;Mutsu&quot; carried many projectiles, immediate suspicion focused on the Type 3 anti-aircraft shell as it was believed to have caused a fire before the war at the Sagami arsenal. Known as &quot;sanshiki-dan&quot; (Japanese for &quot;type 3 shell&quot;), these were fired by the main armament and contained 900 to 1,200 25 mm diameter steel tubes (depending upon sources), each containing an incendiary charge. Tests were conducted at Kamegakubi Naval Proving Ground on several shells salvaged from No. 3 turret and on shells from the previous and succeeding manufacturing batches. Using a specially built model of the &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s No. 3 turret, the experiments were unable to induce the shells to explode under normal conditions.

The commission issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June, well before the divers had completed their investigation of the wreck, and concluded that the explosion was the result of a disgruntled seaman. Historian Mike Williams put forward an alternative theory of fire:

A number of observers noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations&#x27; warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained a large amount of flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.

==Salvage operations==

Divers were brought into the area to retrieve bodies and to assess the damage to the ship. Prior to diving on the wreck they were allowed to familiarize themselves on board &quot;Mutsu&quot;″s sister ship, &quot;Nagato&quot;. The Navy leadership initially gave serious consideration to raising the wreck and rebuilding her, although these plans were dropped after the divers completed their survey of the ship on 22 July. Thus &quot;Mutsu&quot; was struck from the Navy List on 1 September. As part of the investigation, Dive-boat No. 3746, a small &quot;Nishimura&quot;-class search and rescue submarine, explored the wreck on 17 June with a crew of seven officers. While crawling on the harbour bottom, it became snagged on the wreckage and its crew nearly suffocated before they could free themselves and surface. In July 1944, the oil-starved IJN recovered of fuel from the wreck.

The diameter chrysanthemum &quot;mon&quot;, symbol of the Imperial Throne, was raised in 1953 but lost or scrapped shortly thereafter. One of the 140 mm casemate guns was raised in 1963 and donated to the Yasukuni Shrine. In 1970, the Fukada Salvage Company began salvage operations that lasted until 1978 and scrapped about 75% of the ship. The two aft turrets were raised in 1970 and 1971. Despite the fact that the salvaged components were remarkably preserved, in particular the two gun turrets, bow (including chrysanthemum mount) and stern (with every propeller, and intact rudders and steering gear), the ship was broken up for her low-background steel and sold to an anonymous &quot;research institute.&quot; The salvagers retrieved 849 bodies of crewmen lost during the explosion. In 1995, the Mutsu Memorial Museum declared that no further salvage operations were planned.

The only significant portion of the ship that remains is a long section running from the bridge structure forward to the vicinity of No. 1 turret. The highest portion of the ship is below the surface.

===Surviving artifacts===

In addition to the 140 mm gun donated to the Yasukuni Shrine, now on display at the Yasukuni Museum, the following items recovered over the years can be viewed at various museums and memorials in Japan:
* Many artifacts are displayed at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970. To make room for a new road, this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building. Since 1963, a memorial service has been held here every year on 8 June in honour of the crew. A very large portion of the bow was located at Suo-Oshima until at least 2012, but it may have been moved or lost.
* The fully restored No. 4 turret is on display in Etajima at the grounds of the former Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, now the JMSDF’s Naval Academy Etajima. This is the ship&#x27;s original turret, removed during her refit in the 1930s. Other artifacts are also on display at the Naval History Museum on the grounds of the former Naval Academy.
* One 410 mm gun from No. 3 turret formerly on display at the Museum of Maritime Science, Shinagawa, in Tokyo was relocated to the grounds of the Verny Commemorative Museum in Yokosuka in September 2016.
* A rudder and a section of propeller shaft were on display at the Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. The rudder, an anchor and one propeller have been relocated to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly across the street from the Yamato Museum. The left-side 410 mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the propeller shaft is now unknown. Also on display outside the Yamato Museum entrance in Kure are one of Mutsu&#x27;s anchors, a fairlead and the stern pennant jackstaff.
* A part of the number three gun turret&#x27;s armour is on display at Shide Shrine in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture.
* One of the 410 mm guns is on display at the Hijiri Museum in Omi, Nagano.

<doc id="977039" wikidata="Q867103" url="?curid=977039" title="Inferno (Motörhead album)">
<text>Inferno is the seventeenth studio album by British rock band Motörhead, released on 22 June 2004. It was their eighth with the Steamhammer label, and second under Sanctuary Records and its subsidiary Metal-Is in North America and certain territories.

== Recording ==
&quot;Inferno&quot; was Motörhead&#x27;s first album with Cameron Webb producing. Webb told Joel McIver of &quot;Classic Rock Presents Motörhead&quot; in 2010 that he had wanted to make an album with the band for years and met them for dinner at the Sunset Marquis Hotel to discuss the possibility of working together: &quot;I talked about how I wanted to make a really heavy record with them. That was a mistake, because Lemmy likes to play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll – he doesn&#x27;t like to play heavy music – and he called me on it.&quot;

Nonetheless, the band and Webb produced Motorhead&#x27;s heaviest album in years. In an interview for the bonus &quot;Inferno&quot; DVD, drummer Mikkey Dee states that Webb &quot;pushed us a little more. He wasn&#x27;t intimidated by our rock star moods&quot;. Lemmy adds, &quot;That was a great thing, &#x27;cause Mickey can be really intimidating and so can I, and Phil can be really violent.&quot; Not only was Webb able to find unity in the band in terms of recording but also understand Lemmy&#x27;s bass sound, which had a lot more gain than low end. This was mostly attributed to Lemmy&#x27;s hearing loss as he liked his songs to have a &quot;brighter&quot; sound and would always tell Webb to turn down the bass. This created an issue during recording and when Webb complained to manager Todd Singerman, he said, &quot;dude, your ears are different. It&#x27;s just the way it&#x27;s gonna be. You&#x27;re going to find a way to talk to [Lemmy] into doing things.&quot; Eventually, both Webb and Lemmy were able to resolve this matter; one of the ways was to turn on the subwoofer after Lemmy had left the studio.

The band explained that they made &quot;Inferno&quot; the same way as all their other albums – at the last minute – by renting a big rehearsal room in Los Angeles and writing songs for about six weeks and, after a week break, recording them while they&#x27;re still fresh.

== Release ==
The album&#x27;s closing song, &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot;, was somewhat of a departure. A country blues-style song, it was distinguished by acoustic guitar by all three members, with Lemmy adding harmonica towards the end. Dee explained his switch from drums: &quot;I&#x27;ve been playing guitar all my life a little bit, because guitars have always been around, so it&#x27;s nothing spectacular in my eyes.&quot; He added: &quot;It&#x27;s quite fun to walk onstage and do that song. And we definitely surprised the audiences.&quot;

Filming of the video for &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot; was due to take place in a Stringfellow&#x27;s club, but Peter Stringfellow objected to the song title and its associations, and withdrew any involvement. With 24 hours left until the shoot, they found a club in Ealing.

&quot;In the Black&quot; was featured in the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

==Artwork ==
Joe Petagno, long-time sleeve artist for the band, said of the album cover:
== Critical reception ==

Guy Strachan praised &quot;Inferno&quot; in Terrorizer as &quot;the best album that Motörhead have ever recorded&quot;.

However, James Monger of AllMusic chided the band for &quot;churning out the same record over and over again&quot;.

&quot;There are tinges of the blues here, of punk and of metal&quot;, wrote Ian Winwood for &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;played by a band whose sharpness and precision is these days often overlooked.&quot;

In 2011, Motörhead biographer Joel McIver wrote: &quot;&quot;Inferno&quot; was a blast from start to finish. Its bottom-heavy, modern sound suited the songs perfectly; it was almost as if, without realizing it, Motörhead had stamped their identity on the album more honestly than on any other album for at least a decade.&quot;

Lee Marlowe of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; stated in 2013 that &quot;Killers&quot; &quot;is as catchy as anything in the band&#x27;s vast catalogue: a strident stand-out on one of the strongest albums they&#x27;ve done&quot;, while &quot;Whorehouse Blues&quot; &quot;makes perfect sense&quot;.

<doc id="977041" wikidata="Q2042267" url="?curid=977041" title="Homer the Heretic">
<text>&quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; is the third episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on October 8, 1992. In the episode, Homer decides to forgo going to church and has an excellent time staying home. His behavior quickly attracts the wrath of God, who visits him in a dream. The chalkboard gag from this episode was a reference to the previous episode &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, which had made controversial references to New Orleans.

The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Jim Reardon.

==Plot==

One Sunday morning, Homer decides that he will not go to church after seeing how cold it is outside and splitting his pants while getting dressed. Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie attend the day&#x27;s service, but must put up with the church&#x27;s malfunctioning furnace, the doors freezing shut when the churchgoers try to leave after the service ends, and car trouble in the parking lot. Homer, meanwhile, spends the morning goofing around the house, eating large amounts of fatty foods, and watching TV.

When Marge and the children return home, Homer proclaims that he had the best day of his life because he skipped church, and thus he will never attend church again; Marge is horrified by this. That night, Marge prays for Homer; Homer, meanwhile, falls asleep during Marge&#x27;s praying and has a dream about meeting God. In the dream, God is initially enraged at Homer for forsaking his church, but he comes to understand Homer&#x27;s viewpoint and agrees to let him worship in his own way. Homer invents his own religion tailored to his personal tastes, including holidays he invents to get out of work.

Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt to convince Homer to attend church again, but Homer remains devoted to his own religion. The next Sunday morning, while his family is at church, Homer falls asleep on the couch while smoking a lit cigar, which sets the house ablaze. Apu, chief of Springfield&#x27;s volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other volunteer firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Ned rescues Homer from the burning house. The firefighters arrive and extinguish the fire.

Homer interprets the fire as God delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy posits that God was working through Homer&#x27;s friends to save him, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another chance after further encouragement from Reverend Lovejoy. However, while Homer does show up to church the next Sunday, he falls asleep and snores loudly during the service. In the dream Homer has during the service, God consoles Homer on the ultimate failure of Homer&#x27;s invented religion. Homer asks God what the meaning of life is, and after finding out Homer doesn&#x27;t want to wait until he dies to find out on his own, God reluctantly begins to answer Homer&#x27;s question, just as the closing credits start rolling, preventing God from revealing the meaning of life to the viewers.

==Production==

This episode originated when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, &quot;We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, &#x27;Honor the Sabbath&#x27; would be a good one. So the &#x27;Homer doesn&#x27;t go to church&#x27; storyline was given to George Meyer.&quot; Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would &quot;bring the proper degree of rage&quot; to the episode. Meyer had a lot of fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.

This was the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; where the animation was produced by Film Roman and the first where it was overseas at the newly formed Rough Draft Studios (which was founded by Gregg Vanzo, who had directed the episode &quot;There&#x27;s No Disgrace Like Home&quot;). Up until this point, Film Roman had mostly worked on &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; and &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot; episodes, and were not used to the speed in which &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes were produced. However, they quickly adjusted. As for Rough Draft Studios, they were a brand-new company, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was one of the first shows they ever worked on, along with &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. Film Roman and Rough Draft went on to animate the show until the former was replaced by Fox Television Animation in 2016, and also would fully collaborate together on &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; in 2007, along with AKOM, which also oversees the show&#x27;s animation. The latter would also work on Matt Groening&#x27;s other shows, like &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;Disenchantment&quot;. Previously, the animation was produced by Klasky Csupo.

The chalkboard gag for this episode, &quot;I will not defame New Orleans&quot;, was made as an apology to the citizens of New Orleans after it was musically insulted in the previous episode. Along with &quot;Mr. Plow&quot;, a later episode of this season, this is one of the few television episodes that prominently featured snow outside of Christmas or Thanksgiving centric episodes.

In the scene in which Jimi Hendrix and Benjamin Franklin play a game of air hockey in Heaven, Hendrix was supposed to have a speaking line of his own to respond to Franklin&#x27;s line. It was cut late during production because the actor for Hendrix did not sound enough like Hendrix. Franklin&#x27;s line was kept because &quot;nobody knows what he sounds like&quot;, whereas Hendrix had a distinct voice. The abrupt cutting off of God&#x27;s voice before he reveals the meaning of life was intended to be cut off by a voice-over promotion for whatever Fox program aired after &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

The episode was notable for portraying God as having five fingers on each hand, as opposed to the four fingers of every other character on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Extensive debate arose as to the nature and meaning of the design, however, on the DVD commentary, director Jim Reardon confessed that it was simply a production oversight.

==Cultural references==
The brand label on Homer&#x27;s shower radio reads &quot;No-Soap, Radio!&quot;, so-named for the punch line of a well-known practical joke. The scene where Homer dances in his underwear to The Royal Teens song &quot;Short Shorts&quot; is almost identical to a scene in &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983). The burning floor collapsing beneath Flanders&#x27; feet is a reference to &quot;Backdraft&quot;, (1991).
During the exciting football game Homer watches, the commentator refers to the &#x27;surprising return of Jim Brown&#x27;, who had retired in 1966.

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; finished 36th in ratings for the week of October 5–11, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 12.0, equivalent to approximately 11.2 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following &quot;Married… with Children&quot;.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, loved the episode. They described it as &quot;A brilliant episode, underlining everything that The Simpsons is about. Homer hates church, Marge wants the kids to see Homer as an example, and everyone pulls together in the end. Good stuff, and if God really is like that, he&#x27;s a groovy kind of guy.&quot; In 2012, HitFix&#x27;s Alan Sepinwall cited the episode as his favorite of the show, writing that it &quot;captures everything that was and is great about the series: social satire, extraordinary quotability (&#x27;This Things I Believe&#x27;), a good family story, and an innate sweetness in spite of Homer&#x27;s outsized antics.&quot; When asked to pick his favorite season out of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; seasons one through twenty, Paul Lane of the &quot;Niagara Gazette&quot; picked season four and highlighted &quot;Brother from the Same Planet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; which he called &quot;excellent&quot;, along with &quot;the sweetly funny&quot; &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;, and &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot;.

In 2004, ESPN.com released a list of the Top 100 &quot;Simpsons&quot; sport moments, ranking Benjamin Franklin and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s air hockey game, a scene from the episode, at #83. The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;Risky Business&quot; was named the 45th greatest film reference in the history of the show by &quot;Total Film&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Ditum.

Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer, named it his favorite episode of the show together with &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot; and &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;. When &quot;The Simpsons&quot; began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes to watch on the service. The writers of the Fox program &quot;King of the Hill&quot; put &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; among the five best episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, including &quot;Brother from the Same Planet&quot;, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;.

Nathan Rabin writes: &quot;For all its good-natured heresy, &#x27;Homer The Heretic&#x27; is respectful enough toward religion to put the moral of the episode in Reverend Lovejoy’s mouth when he tells Homer that God was &#x27;working in the hearts of your neighbors when they came to your aid, be they Christian, Jew, or miscellaneous.&#x27; Many episodes of The Simpsons center around Homer and Marge’s marriage being tested and ultimately reaffirmed. In &#x27;Homer The Heretic&#x27; it’s Homer’s faith that is aggressively tested before ultimately being reaffirmed. The strength and value of religion, the episode argues, ultimately lies not in its power to force people to follow arbitrary rules or go to a building every Sunday but rather in its capacity for teaching people to listen to their better angels and love and serve their fellow man. That makes &#x27;Homer The Heretic&#x27; not just funny but also surprisingly profound.&quot;

<doc id="977044" wikidata="Q667759" url="?curid=977044" title="Bananas (Deep Purple album)">
<text>Bananas is the seventeenth studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, released on 25 August 2003 by EMI Records and on 7 October 2003 by Sanctuary Records in the US. It is the first album to feature Don Airey on organ and keyboards, replacing founding member Jon Lord.

==Overview==
The album was recorded in Los Angeles during January and February 2003. It is also notable as being the first Ian Gillan-fronted Deep Purple album to make use of backing vocals other than Gillan&#x27;s own (since the 1972 sessions for the song &quot;Woman From Tokyo&quot; in Germany which featured Jon Lord and Roger Glover singing backing vocals) with the song &quot;Haunted&quot; featuring Beth Hart. The album includes &quot;Contact Lost&quot;, a short slow instrumental requiem for the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; astronauts, written by guitarist Steve Morse when he heard the news of the crash.

The photo in the album cover was taken by the band&#x27;s manager Bruce Payne.

&quot;Bananas&quot; charted well despite lack of media exposure, especially in Europe and South America (notably at Germany and Argentina where it peaked in the top 10).

==Unreleased tracks==
Since the &quot;Abandon&quot; album, Deep Purple performed three new songs onstage. &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; was debuted in the summer of 2000 but not included on &quot;Bananas&quot;. Another new song, &quot;Up The Wall&quot; was played on the 2002 UK tour and reworked into &quot;I Got Your Number&quot;. The instrumental &quot;Well Dressed Guitar&quot; remained unreleased until the next album, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Rapture of the Deep&quot;.

<text>The Avon Wildlife Trust aims to protect and promote wildlife in the area of the former county of Avon – now Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire, in England. It has its headquarters in Bristol and runs wildlife centres at Folly Farm, Somerset and Grow Wilder, Frenchay, North Bristol.

The trust was formed in 1980, has 17,500 members, and manages 35 nature reserves, ranging from salt marshes and reedbeds to wildflower meadows and ancient woodlands, covering a total of including 12 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The trust also provides advice to local authorities and landowners on land management and conservation, and provides educational visits for school children and lifelong learning for adults.

The Avon Wildlife Trust is part of the Wildlife Trusts partnership of 46 wildlife trusts in the United Kingdom, and carries out its work through a network of staff and over 500 volunteers.

==History==

The first development following the formation of the trust in 1980 was the establishment of England&#x27;s first urban nature reserve at Brandon Hill, bringing hay meadows, wildlife ponds and butterfly gardens into a formal city park. In 1981 Stockwood Open Space came under the trust&#x27;s management to encourage a range of wildlife and have been particularly successful with common spotted orchids. Other early work in the 1980s included taking over the management of Littleton Brick Pits near Littleton-upon-Severn, an artificial lagoon once the site of clay extraction for brick making, and reintroducing reedbeds close to the Severn Estuary, as a feeding and resting place for migrating birds.

Since the 1980s the trust has campaigned to save wetlands in the Gordano Valley in North Somerset where Clapton Moor (40 hectares of grassland) near Clapton in Gordano, Weston Big Wood, (38 hectares of ancient woodland), and Weston Moor (59 hectares of wet grassland) near Weston in Gordano and Walton Common north east of Walton in Gordano are now rich in birdlife. The installation of sluice gates in the 1990s raised the water levels and encouraged lapwing to breed.

At Dolebury Warren Iron Age hillfort, special grassland and rare butterflies have been encouraged by the trust&#x27;s scrub clearance work.

In 1987 the Folly Farm was purchased from the Strachey family to be developed as a nature reserve with traditional farm operations. The purchase was made possible by an anonymous donation of £250,000, which was followed by grants and donations from the South West of England Regional Development Agency, and Biffaward supplementing local fund-raising efforts with the centre finally opening in April 2008.

The trust was one of the first to carry out garden wildlife surveys. One of these revealed the astonishingly rich flora that existed in Narroways, St Werburghs, an inner area of Bristol, and was used as part of a campaign against the use of of the hill as a storage depot for heavy equipment and lorry access for construction of the Avon Tramway.

In 1991 campaigns to save Royate Hill in Bristol from development resulted in the first compulsory purchase of a wildlife site in England. In another Bristol campaign, the trust fought Bristol City Council against the extension of the quarry next to Ashton Court. In 1997 the trust bought Puxton Moor to prevent it being converted into a golf course and holiday resort. Other campaign have included preserving breeding space for skylarks at Hengrove Park.

The oldest greater horseshoe bat ever recorded in Britain, &quot;Boris&quot;, was discovered at Brown&#x27;s Folly in January 2000. The mines themselves are of great speleological and historical interest. They are extremely well decorated and contain many delicate stalactites and examples of gull formation (caves features formed by landslippage). The mine provided stone for the facade of Buckingham palace. In 2000 access was unilaterally withdrawn pending the results of a mine inspectors report on the safety of the mines. This report was required because of the health and safety at work act which affects employees/volunteers of the trust who might have to enter the mine to count the bats. These legal requirements do not affect leisure access by cavers. Prior to 2000 access to the mine was controlled by the CSCC and cavers had coexisted with a thriving bat population with voluntary restrictions on the access during the bat roosting season. There is no evidence of caving activity adversely affecting the bat population.

Since 2000 the trust has been a leading partner in the Avon Biodiversity Partnership which aims to create &quot;A landscape rich in wildlife, where species and habitats are part of healthy, functioning ecosystems that are well-managed and valued by everyone; where conservation of biodiversity is integrated with social, cultural and economic activities&quot;.

Each winter since 2000/2001 the trust has organised a birdwatch. Between 2000 and 2007 this demonstrated falls in the starling and sparrow populations, with great spotted woodpeckers and jackdaws on the increase within the area.

In 2008 a successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund resulted in an award of £396,000 for the new &#x27;Wildlife – it&#x27;s all about us!&#x27; project which will offer a variety of ways for people to get active in their own neighbourhoods through talks, walks, and events, including wildlife gardening workshops and practical volunteering work.

At its Portbury reserve, nearby residents pay a levy of £70 a year to the trust for the reserve&#x27;s upkeep; this has generated some criticisms over the trust&#x27;s transparency, with some residents saying that the trust has not told them what it spends the money on.

On 25 April 2022, Avon Wildlife Trust announced the relocation of its headquarters from 32, Jacobs well road to 17, Great George Street (). The former headquarters was listed in June of the same year, and eventually sold at auction in February 2023 for £850,00.

==Nature reserves==

Avon Wildlife Trust&#x27;s newest nature reserve, Bennett&#x27;s Patch and White&#x27;s Paddock will see a 12-acre neglected former sports facility transformed into a wildlife haven of wildflower meadows, native woodland, hedgerows and ponds in time for Bristol as European Green Capital 2015. Once open, the plan is to use the new Bennett&#x27;s Patch and White&#x27;s Paddock Reserve to encourage people to create new homes for wildlife in their own gardens.

The Nature Reserves include:
(* = Reserves designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest)

Avon Wildlife Trust also run Grow Wilder a wildlife-friendly food growing project.

<doc id="977047" wikidata="Q521916" url="?curid=977047" title="H2S (radar)">
<text>H2S was the first airborne, ground scanning radar system. It was developed for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Bomber Command during World War II to identify targets on the ground for night and all-weather bombing. This allowed attacks outside the range of the various radio navigation aids like Gee or Oboe, which were limited to about of range from various base stations. It was also widely used as a general navigation system, allowing landmarks to be identified at long range.

In March 1941, experiments with an early aircraft interception radar based on the 9.1 cm wavelength, (3 GHz) cavity magnetron revealed that different objects have very different radar signatures; water, open land and built-up areas of cities and towns all produced distinct returns. In January 1942, a new team was set up to combine the magnetron with a new scanning antenna and plan position indicator display. The prototype&#x27;s first use in April confirmed that a map of the area below the aircraft could be produced using radar. The first systems went into service in early 1943 as the H2S Mk. I and H2S Mk. II, as well as ASV Mark III.

On its second operational mission on 2/3 February 1943, an H2S was captured almost intact by German forces, and a second unit a week later. Combined with intelligence gathered from the surviving crew, they learned it was a mapping system and were able to determine its method of operation. When they pieced one together from parts and saw the display of Berlin, near panic broke out in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. This led to the introduction of the FuG 350 &quot;Naxos&quot; radar detector in late 1943, which enabled &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; night fighters to home on the transmissions of H2S. The British learned of Naxos and a great debate ensued over the use of H2S. Later calculations showed that losses after the introduction of Naxos were actually less than before it, and use continued.

After it was found the resolution of the early sets was too low to be useful over large cities like Berlin, in 1943 work started on a version operating in the X band at 3 cm (10 GHz), the H2S Mk. III. Almost simultaneously, its American equivalent was introduced as the H2X in October of that year. A wide variety of slightly different Mk. III&#x27;s were produced before the Mk. IIIG was selected as the late-war standard. Development continued through the late-war Mk. IV to the 1950s era Mk. IX that equipped the V bomber fleet and the English Electric Canberra. In the V-force, Mk. IXA was tied into both the bombsight and navigation system to provide a complete long-range Navigation and Bombing System (NBS). In this form, H2S was last used operationally during the Falklands War in 1982 on the Avro Vulcan. Some H2S Mk. IX units remained in service on the Handley Page Victor aircraft until 1993, providing fifty years of service.

== Etymology of &quot;H2S&quot; ==
The radar was originally called &quot;BN&quot; (Blind Navigation), but it quickly became &quot;H2S&quot;. The genesis of this remains somewhat contentious, with different sources claiming it meant &quot;Height to Slope&quot;; or &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. The &quot;S&quot; was already being used by the aircraft interception radar team as a deliberately confusing abbreviation for its operating wavelength in the &quot; &quot; range, which ultimately gave name to the S band. It is widely reported that it was named after hydrogen sulphide (chemical formula H2S, in connection with its rotten smell), because the inventor realized that had he simply pointed the radar downward instead of towards the sky, he would have a new use for radar, ground tracking instead of for identifying air targets and that it was simply &quot;rotten&quot; that he had not thought of it sooner.

The &quot;rotten&quot; connection, with a twist, is propounded by R. V. Jones, director of the Air Ministry&#x27;s scientific intelligence unit. He relates the tale that, owing to a misunderstanding between the original developers and Frederick Lindemann (ennobled as Lord Cherwell in 1941), science advisor to Winston Churchill, development of the technology was delayed as the engineers thought that Lord Cherwell did not like the idea. Later, when Cherwell asked how the project was progressing, he was most upset to hear that it had been put on hold and repeatedly declared about the delay that &quot;it stinks&quot;. The engineers called the resumed project &quot;H2S&quot; and later, when Cherwell inquired what H2S stood for, no one dared tell him that it was named after his phrase. Instead, they pretended, on the spot, that it meant &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, which was the meaning that Cherwell related to others (including Jones).

== Development ==

=== Genesis ===
After the Battle of Britain, RAF Bomber Command began night attacks against German cities. Although Bomber Command had reported good results from the raids, the Butt Report showed only one bomb in twenty landed within of the target, half the bombs fell on open country, and in some cases, the bombing was seen to fall as far as from the target.

Radio electronics promised some improvement and the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) developed a radio navigation system called &quot;Gee&quot; and then a second known as &quot;Oboe&quot;. Both were based on transmitter stations in the UK which sent out synchronized signals. In the case of Gee, an oscilloscope in the aircraft measured the time difference between two signals to determine location. Oboe used a transponder in the aircraft to reflect the signals back to the UK where operators carried out the same measurements on much larger displays to produce more accurate values. In both cases, the ground-based portion of the system limited range to a line-of-sight, about for aircraft flying at typical mission altitudes. This was useful against targets in the Ruhr, but not the heart of Germany.

Taffy Bowen had noticed during his early 1.5 m wavelength AI radar experiments before the war that the radar returns from fields, cities and other areas were different. This was due to geometry; objects with vertical sides, like buildings or ships, produced much stronger returns than flat objects like the ground or sea. During early tests of the AI system, the operator would often see coastlines at very long distances, and the development team used this as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; navigation system on several occasions. Bowen had suggested developing a targeting radar based on this principle, but the matter had been forgotten.

In 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot, PhD students at the University of Birmingham, devised a new microwave-frequency vacuum tube known as the cavity magnetron that output thousands of watts of radio signal at 9 cm wavelength. At this wavelength, the antennas were only a few centimeters long, making radar much easier to fit into an aircraft. The mapping idea resurfaced in March 1941 when Philip Dee&#x27;s group was developing a new AI radar, christened &quot;AIS&quot; in reference to its &quot;sentimetric&quot; wavelength. During tests in a Blenheim, the team noticed the same sort of effects Bowen had earlier. The set&#x27;s wavelength, over ten times shorter than the original 1.5 m AI sets, provided much greater resolution and allowed them to pick out individual objects on the ground.

===Work begins===
In October 1941, Dee attended a meeting of the RAF Bomber Command where the night targeting issue was discussed. Dee mentioned the recent discoveries using AIS. On 1 November, Dee performed an experiment in which he used an AIS radar mounted on a Blenheim to scan the ground. Using this display he was able to pick up the outline of a town away while flying at altitude.

The commanders were impressed and, on 1 January 1942, the TRE set up a team under Bernard Lovell to develop an S-band airborne targeting radar based on AIS. An initial order for 1,500 sets was placed. It was clear even at this point that a plan position indicator (PPI) display would be desirable, but this would require a complex scanning parabolic antenna, compared to the very simple set of fixed antennas used in the A-scope system. It was decided to test both systems. In March, it was decided that both H2S and a new centimetric air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar, ASV Mk. III, would be built using the same components, simplifying production.

In early tests in April, the superiority of the scanning PPI system was evident, and all work on the older A-scope version ended. H2S performed its first experimental flight on 23 April 1942, with the radar mounted in a Handley Page Halifax bomber, &quot;V9977&quot;. The scanning unit was installed in the aircraft&#x27;s belly using the position previously occupied by the mid-under turret, which was by that time seldom installed. The rotating scanner mounting was designed and manufactured by Nash &amp; Thompson. The scanning aerial was covered by a distinctive streamlined radome.

One problem was that the returns from closer objects were much stronger than more distant objects, due to the radar equation. This made the area directly under the bomber much brighter than the surroundings if the signal was not adjusted to account for this. The solution was to adjust the broadcast power according to the cosecant-squared rule, so-called after the mathematical function that defined the effective change in gain. The change was originally produced by fixing an angled metal plate on part of the parabolic reflector of the aerial, as may be seen in the picture of the aerial on a Halifax bomber. Later reflectors were actually shaped with a cosecant-squared curvature, no longer a perfect parabolic section.

On 7 June 1942, the Halifax performing H2S tests crashed, killing everyone on board and destroying the prototype H2S. One of the dead was Alan Blumlein, the chief designer. Lovell recalled that after inspecting the crash site &quot;it is, perhaps, hardly surprising that I believed this to be the end of the H2S project&quot;. Also killed in the crash were Blumlein&#x27;s colleagues Cecil Oswald Browne and Frank Blythen; a TRE scientist Geoffrey S. Hensby, and seven RAF personnel.

===Magnetron debate===
As development continued, a great debate broke out in the Air Ministry and RAF about the relative merits of the H2S system. While the ability to bomb in all weather at great distances was obviously useful to Bomber Command, the loss of an H2S aircraft would potentially reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. Churchill&#x27;s science advisor, Lord Cherwell, wanted the design team to build H2S around the klystron rather than the magnetron.

Unlike a klystron, which is made mostly of glass and fragile metal parts, the magnetron was built out of a single block of copper that would be extremely difficult to destroy with any reasonable demolition charge. If a magnetron was recovered by the Germans, they would immediately understand its operation. Since the magnetron was also being designed for use in night fighters and Coastal Command, the loss of the secret would not only provide the Germans with the information to build radar detectors on this new frequency, but also allow them to develop their own effective airborne radars.

The H2S design team did not believe the klystron could do the job, and tests of an H2S built with klystrons showed a drop in output power by a factor of 20 to 30. At the same altitude, the klystron powered versions were able to detect a town at while the magnetron version was capable of . There appeared to be no way to improve this, so it would have to be the magnetron or nothing. The H2S team also protested that it would take the Germans two years to develop a centimetric radar once the cavity magnetron fell into their hands and that there was no reason to believe they were not working on the technology already. The first concern would prove correct; although a magnetron was captured in early 1943, the war ended before German examples were in production.

In the midst of the debate, Isidor Isaac Rabi of the American Radiation Laboratory visited the TRE offices on 5 and 6 July 1942. According to Lovell, Rabi stated that the H2S device provided to them during the Tizard Mission was &quot;unscientific and unworkable&quot; and expressed his feelings that the only use of it would be to hand the magnetron to the Germans. Years later, Lovell attempted to discover the reasons for this negative report, but he found that no one recalled Rabi being so negative. The only explanation that anyone had was that problems getting the sets working were taken out of context. Taffy Bowen had noted that he had significant trouble getting the sets to do anything in the US; in testing against Springfield, Hartford and Boston, the display simply did not show anything.

By September, a prototype version suitable for operational use was ready. While debate on the issue of losing a magnetron to the Germans continued, on 15 September Churchill personally released the magnetron for use by Bomber Command. During this same period, it had been noticed that German submarines had been fitted with a radar detector, later known to be the FuMB 1 &quot;Metox 600A&quot;, which allowed them to detect Coastal Command&#x27;s ASV sets operating on the older 1.5 m band. In September the decision was made to prioritize construction for the ASV Mk. III, which the Germans would not be able to detect. It was felt the chance that a magnetron falling into German hands from a patrol aircraft was vanishingly small.

===Emergency relocation===
The Air Ministry radar groups had originally formed up at Bawdsey Manor on the eastern coast of England. When the war began in 1939, this location was considered too exposed to a potential German attack, and a pre-arranged move to the University of Dundee was carried out almost overnight. On arrival, it was found nothing was prepared and there was little room for the teams to work in. Worse, the team working on airborne radars ended up at a tiny private airstrip in Perth, Scotland that was entirely unsuitable for development.

It took some time before the nature of the problem was finally accepted by management and a search began for a new location. In late 1939, the Airborne team moved to RAF St Athan, about from Cardiff. Although this location should have been ideal, they found themselves in a disused hangar with no heating, and work became almost impossible as the weather turned cold. The main research teams remained in Dundee during this period.

The ongoing search for a more suitable location for all the teams led to the selection of Swanage on the southern coast of the UK. The rest of the original radar group moved there in May 1940, the AI group arriving the day before them. The AI group, located in shacks on the shoreline near Worth Matravers, was particularly exposed and only a short distance from German-occupied Cherbourg. While the move was taking place, A.P. Rowe took the opportunity to set up a second airborne group working with magnetrons, sidelining Bowen&#x27;s group. Bowen was soon forced out of the TRE and sent on the Tizard Mission that summer.

On 25 May 1942, Combined Operations Headquarters carried out Operation Biting to capture a Würzburg radar that had been photographed near the French coast. This led to concerns that the Germans might launch a similar raid on British installations. When reports were received that &quot;seventeen train loads&quot; of paratroopers had been stationed near Cherbourg, directly across the English Channel from Christchurch, near panic broke out in the Air Ministry, and yet another emergency move was made. The team ended up at Malvern College about to the north. This provided ample office space but little in the way of housing and introduced yet more delays in the development program.

==Operational use==

===Service entry===
Despite all the problems, on 3 July 1942 Churchill held a meeting with his military commanders and the H2S group, where he surprised the radar designers by demanding the delivery of 200 H2S sets by 15 October 1942. The H2S design team was under great pressure, but they were given priority on resources. The pressure also gave them an excellent argument to convince Lord Cherwell that the klystron-based H2S program finally be dropped.

TRE failed to meet the 15 October deadline; by 1 January 1943, only twelve Stirling and twelve Halifax bombers had been fitted with H2S. On the night of 30 January 1943, thirteen Stirlings and Halifaxes of the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; force used H2S to drop incendiaries or flares on a target in Hamburg. One hundred Lancasters following the Pathfinders used the flares as the target for their bombsights. The results were considered &quot;satisfactory&quot;. Similar raids were carried out against Turin the next night, and Cologne on the night of 2/3 February.

On 21 February, the decision was made to equip all Bomber Command aircraft with H2S, not only as a bombing aid but also as a navigation aid. In early operations, H2S had proved able to detect coastlines at such a great distance that it could be used as a long-range navigation system, allowing the aircraft to fly in all weather. To aid the navigator, the bomb aimer had the task of operating the H2S during these periods. To further improve operations, on 12 March it was decided that Bomber Command would receive more of the available spares, as it was believed that they would need to make up for higher casualty rates. Previously, every equipped squadron was required to hold 100% spares for all parts, and there simply were not enough to go around.

===H2S Mk. II, production version===

The original H2S sets were essentially prototype units that were hand-built to equip the Pathfinders with all possible speed. Among the many problems with the rushed service entry was that the developers were forced to use existing plug-and-socket designs to connect the various units of the complete set together. There were no bulkhead mounting male connectors available at this time, and consequently many of the male free connectors at the ends of cable runs carried exposed lethal voltages. While installations of the prototypes progressed, work was underway on a true production version, the Mk. II, which would go on to be the most numerous version built. This was largely identical to the Mk. I&#x27;s with the exception of various packaging and electronics details intended to make them easier to build.

Bomber Command started general use of H2S in summer 1943. On the night of 24 July, the RAF began Operation Gomorrah, a large attack on Hamburg. By that time, H2S had been fitted to Lancasters, which became a backbone of Bomber Command. With the target marked by Pathfinders using H2S, RAF bombers hit the city with high explosive and incendiary bombs. They returned on 25 and 27 July, with the USAAF performing two daylight attacks in between the three RAF raids. Large parts of the city were burned to the ground by a firestorm. About 45,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed.

The Mk. II was soon upgraded to the Mk. IIA version, which differed from the Mk. II only in the detail of the scanner antenna; IIA replaced the original dipole antenna at the scanner&#x27;s focal point with a feed horn that sent the signal back to the receiver in a waveguide, eliminating the lossy coaxial cable of the earlier model.

===Scanning improvements===
It was noted on even the earliest flights of &quot;V9977&quot; that a number of basic features of the H2S made it difficult to use. Attempts to fix these began even before H2S entered service, but a number of problems greatly delayed their entry. Added as they became available, this produced a profusion of different Marks, detailed below.

Late in April 1942, during a test flight of &quot;V9977&quot;, the prototype unit was shown to Flight Lieutenant E. Dickie, a navigator. Dickie pointed out that navigational charts were always produced with north at the top, while the PPI display of H2S had the top of the display representing whatever direction the aircraft was flying. He suggested that this would cause significant problems during navigation. This had not been considered before because H2S had been developed as a bombing aid. Now that it was also used as an important navigation aid, this was a major issue. This led to a crash program at EMI to modify the prototype sets with a system to correct this problem. This was solved with the introduction of a selsyn (or &quot;servo&quot;) connected to the aircraft&#x27;s gyrocompass, whose output modified the scan rotation.

Testing of this modification immediately revealed another problem. With the display always showing north-up, it was no longer obvious whether the aircraft was flying towards its target, which previously was easy to see as the target would be at the top of the display. To address this, a further addition produced a bright line on the display indicating the direction of travel. A later modification allowed the heading indicator line to be manually controlled by the operator. This was used in concert with the Mark XIV bomb sight to accurately correct for any wind blowing the aircraft off the bomb line. The indicator was set to an initial angle provided by the bomb aimer, and from then the navigator could see any residual drift on his display and call out corrections to the pilot, and to the bomb aimer who would update his settings in the bombsight. This basic idea was later expanded to allow the navigator&#x27;s measurements to be automatically sent back to the bombsight, meaning the bomb aimer no longer had to do this during the approach. Since the other settings, like altitude and airspeed, were already automatically fed in from the aircraft instruments, this left only the selection of the elevation of the target over sea level to be set manually, which could be done before the mission.

The other problem was that when the aircraft rolled, the signal hit the ground only on the lower side of the aircraft, filling one side of the display with a solid signal while the other side was blank. This was particularly annoying because it was during the last minute of the approach to the target that the navigator would be giving course corrections to the pilot, rendering the display unusable every time the pilot responded. This problem was solved through the introduction of a mechanical stabilizer that kept the scanning system level with respect to the ground. A preliminary version was ready by September 1943, but several problems were noted, and it was not until 5 November that the decision was made to move it into production. By this time development of the 3 cm version of H2S was underway, and Nash &amp; Thompson promised to have versions of the stabilizer for both 10 and 3 cm units available by 15 December 1943.

A final problem related to the geometry of the signals returned by the radar. As the scanning angle increased, the time taken for the signal to return did not increase linearly, but hyperbolically. As a result, returns close to the aircraft were fairly similar to what would be seen on a map, but those further from the aircraft were increasingly compressed in range. At the shortest range setting, , this was not a serious problem, but at the longest, , this made the display very difficult to understand. This led F. C. Williams to develop a new time base generator that also output a hyperbolic signal, fixing this problem. This was called the &quot;scan corrected indicator&quot;, or display Type 184.

All of these concepts were being worked on largely in parallel, and at a meeting in March 1944, it was learned that only low rates of production could be expected through the end of the year. By that time the new 3 cm sets were being introduced as well, and this led to a profusion of various Marks featuring one or more of these additional corrections. These delays had not been expected, and Lovell later noted:
===Fishpond===
Radar operates by sending out very short pulses of a radio signal from a transmitter, then turning the transmitter off and listening for echoes in a receiver. The output of the receiver is sent to an oscilloscope&#x27;s brightness input, so strong echoes cause a spot on the screen to light up. To make the spots correspond to locations in space, the oscilloscope quickly scans from the centre to the outside of the display; echoes that return later in time are produced further out on the display, indicating a further distance from the aircraft. The times are synchronized by using the transmission pulse to trigger the scan.

In the case of H2S, the echoes are returned from the ground and objects on it. That means the very first signal that would normally be received would be from the ground directly beneath the aircraft, as this is the closest to the aircraft. Since the echo from this location took some time to return to the aircraft, the time needed to travel to the ground and back at the aircraft&#x27;s current altitude, the H2S display naturally had an empty area around the centre of the display, with its radius representing the altitude of the aircraft. This was known as the &quot;centre-zero&quot;. Normally the operator used a dial that delayed the start of the sweep in order to reduce the size of this centre-zero, and thereby increase the amount of the screen used for the ground display.

When the centre-zero was not entirely dialled out, operators noticed that fleeting echoes were visible within this circle, and quickly concluded these were from other aircraft. This presented a simple way to see enemy night fighters as long as they were below the bomber and not far enough away that they would be hidden in the ground return. German night fighters normally approached from below as it helped silhouette the target aircraft against the Moon, and the lack of a gun position in that location made it safe to approach from that direction. This left them ideally positioned for detection by H2S. However, the display was very small, and this blank area on the screen only a small portion of that, so seeing these returns was difficult.

In early 1943 German night fighter operations were improving. Between January and April 1943 Bomber Command lost a total of 584 aircraft to the defences. Although this represented only 4% of the sorties, this was nevertheless worrying because the increasing daylight length during the summer meant that the defences would inevitably be more effective. Several systems were already under development to help the bombers defend themselves, including the Monica radar (a simple adaptation of the original AI Mk. IV radar from the RAF&#x27;s own night fighters) and the Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT), which was intended to automate defensive fire. However, the former proved almost useless in practice, and it was already clear the latter would not be available at least until 1944.

Dudley Saward, the Bomber Command liaison with the radar teams, visited the Malvern site on 18 April to view progress on the microwave radars and mentioned the problem to Lovell. He was particularly frustrated by a raid carried out the night before on 16/17 April on the Škoda Works, where 11.3% of the attacking force was lost due to enemy action and all other issues. Mentioning the problems with Monica and especially the AGLT, Saward told Lovell:

Lovell was aware that this was indeed possible. The team promised they could build a sample of a special display that was effectively the opposite of the main mapping display; instead of adjusting the display so the centre-zero was eliminated and thus provide maximum screen space to the map, this new display would adjust the size of the centre-zero until it filled the display, thus making the returns from other aircraft easier to see. They only asked that the &quot;whole affair was to be kept quiet to avoid difficulties&quot;.

Saward supplied an electronics technician, Sergeant Walker, and two mechanics, all of whom arrived the next day and immediately set about building a display in Halifax &quot;BB360&quot;. The basic idea was to use the delay timer that reduced the size of the centre-zero as a switch; the existing display would receive returns exactly as it had before, with everything before that timer being suppressed, while a new display would receive everything before that time, and could be adjusted so the centre-zero filled the display. This would result in one display showing everything in the air, and a second providing a ground map exactly as before. The first experimental system flew on 27 May with a Mosquito providing a target. The Mosquito clearly appeared on the display, and photographs of the display caused much excitement.
When the photos reached the desk of Bomber Command&#x27;s Deputy Commander-in-Chief Robert Saundby, he immediately sent a message to the Air Ministry demanding that they be installed with all possible speed. The new display, given the official title Type 182 and nicknamed &quot;Mousetrap&quot;, was on the assembly line by August 1943. At this point, the team received a message demanding they immediately stop using the name Mousetrap as that was the name of an upcoming secret mission. They were officially allocated the new name &quot;Fishpond&quot;, a choice that was made official by a telegram from Churchill on 9 July. The first operational units went into service in October 1943, and by the spring of 1944, most of Bomber Command&#x27;s aircraft carried it. Two hundred examples of the prototype model were produced before a slightly modified version was introduced, the Type 182A. This version had the range fixed at , with the side-effect that if the aircraft flew below this altitude the ground appeared as a ring of noise on the display.

The Type 182 display was normally located at the radio operator&#x27;s station, not the navigator&#x27;s. This reduced the navigator&#x27;s workload while also simplifying communications when a target was seen; the radio operator could easily communicate with the crew or send messages to other aircraft. Normally a number of blips would be seen, as other aircraft in the bomber stream made excellent returns. These remained largely stationary on the display as they were all flying roughly the same path, so enemy fighters were easy to see as dots moving around within the pattern of returns. If it was suspected a blip was approaching the bomber, they would change their heading and see if the blip followed; if it did, immediate defensive manoeuvring started.

===X band===
The resolution of any radar is a function of the wavelength used and the size of the antenna. In the case of H2S, the antenna size was a function of the bomber&#x27;s turret opening, and when combined with the 10 cm wavelength, this led to a resolution of 8 degrees in arc. This was much coarser than desired, both for mapping purposes and for Coastal Command&#x27;s desires to easily detect submarine conning towers. On 6 February 1943, work began on an X band version of the electronics, operating at 3 cm. This would improve resolution to 3 degrees when used with the same antenna. When priority was given to Bomber Command, Coastal Command responded by producing specifications for a far more advanced ASV system operating at 1.25 cm, but this was not completed by the end of the war.

Work on 3 cm magnetrons had been ongoing for some time, and an AIS unit with such a device had been fitted to the nose of RAF Defford&#x27;s Boeing 247-D, &quot;DZ203&quot; as early as 1942. This aircraft had originally been supplied by the Canadian Defence Research Board to test US models of AI radar, and since then had been widely used in the development of several versions of AI, ASV and H2S. George Beeching had been assigned the task of fitting H2S to the Stirling, and in early 1943 he managed to obtain a single 3 cm magnetron from Herbert Skinner&#x27;s AI group working on the Boeing. He had it working in the H2S electronics in a benchtop set on 7 March 1943, and then quickly fit it to Stirling &quot;N3724&quot; to make its first flight on 11 March. Testing showed the unit had very short range, and could not be used effectively over altitude. Further work was delayed by the need to fit the existing 10 cm sets to operational aircraft.

Bomber Command began a series of large-scale raids on Berlin on the nights of 23/24 August, 31 August/1 September and 3/4 September 1943. H2S was found to be largely useless on these missions; the city was so large that picking out features proved very difficult. On 5 September, Saward visited the H2S team and showed them photographs of the PPI displays from H2S over Berlin. On the range setting, used during the bomb run, returns covered the entire display and there were no clear outlines of large objects on which to navigate. This was a surprise given the excellent results over Hamburg. After much argument among teams within the TRE on how to address this problem, on 14 September the team began working on an official version of H2S working in the X band.

By this time the American MIT Radiation Laboratory facility was also entering the fray. They had decided to move directly to the 3 cm wavelength, calling their unit H2X. It was being deployed on American bombers by October 1943. By June there was an ongoing debate in the UK whether to continue the development of their own 3 cm H2S sets or simply use the American units when they became available. The suggestion was made that the existing H2S Mk. II units should be converted to X band, and the Americans should work on 3 cm ASV instead. This was followed by a 7 June meeting in which TRE management decided to press for three squadrons of 3 cm H2S by the end of the year. Lovell&#x27;s team considered this to be basically impossible. Instead, they hatched a private plan to build and install a total of six sets which would equip Pathfinder Force Lancasters by the end of October.

Work continued on what was now known as H2S Mk. III, and an experimental set was first used over Berlin on the night of 18/19 November 1943. In comparison to the first mission with the Mk. I sets, the results using Mk. III were described as &quot;most outstanding&quot;. Mk. III was rushed into production and saw its first real operational use on 2 December.

From this point until the end of the war, the Mk. III became the backbone of the Bomber Command fleet, and a large variety of versions were introduced. The first modification was the out-of-sequence Mk. IIIB, which added the range corrected Type 184 display unit from the IIC models, but lacked roll stabilization. Stabilization was added in the next version to see service, the Mk. IIIA. The new &quot;whirligig&quot; scanner was added to the Mk. IIIA to produce Mk. IIIC, while the original scanner with a higher power magnetron produced the Mk. IIID. The Type 216 display, using magnetic deflection, which was much easier to mass-produce, was added to the original IIIA to produce the Mk. IIIE, while the whirligig was added to the same unit to make the Mk. IIIF.

By the middle of 1944, the war in Europe was clearly entering its final stages, and the RAF began making plans to begin attacks on Japan with the Tiger Force group. In order to equip these aircraft, which would need both targeting and long-range navigation, a conversion system for the earlier Mk. II units was introduced. Based on non-stabilized IIC units, the Mk. IIIG used a new magnetron and receiver for 3 cm operation like the other Mk. III systems. The primary goal was to use it for long-range navigation, as opposed to bomb aiming. The final Mk. IIIH was IIIG with the Type 216 display.

== Rotterdam Gerät ==
Before H2S was deployed in 1943, there was an intense debate over whether to use it due to the possibility of it being lost to the Germans. As it turned out, this occurred almost immediately. On its second combat mission, during the raid on Cologne on the night of 2/3 February 1943, one of the Stirlings carrying H2S was shot down near Rotterdam by the crew of Oblt Frank &amp; Fw Gotter. The device immediately attracted the attention of Wolfgang Martini&#x27;s technicians, who managed to salvage everything except for the PPI display.

Giving it the name &quot;Rotterdam Gerät&quot; (Rotterdam apparatus), a group formed to exploit the device and met for the first time on 23 February 1943 at Telefunken&#x27;s offices in Berlin. A second example, also with a destroyed PPI, was captured on 1 March, ironically from a bomber that was part of a group attacking and greatly damaging Telefunken&#x27;s offices, destroying the first example in the process.

According to Lovell, interrogation of surviving members of the second crew revealed that:

Combined with their own display, a set was reassembled on the Humboldthain flak tower in Berlin. When it was activated clear images of the city appeared on the display, causing considerable consternation for Hermann Göring. A quickly adopted countermeasure was put in place by installing small corner reflectors around the city, producing bright spots on the display in areas that would otherwise be empty, like lakes and rivers. Producing the reflectors with the required angular accuracy proved to be a difficult problem, as did keeping them in the right positions in order to produce the right image.

Although the basic concept of the magnetron was immediately understood, a number of details of the system as a whole remained a mystery, and it was also realized that building a complete radar system using it would take some time. So for the short term, they gave &quot;panic priority&quot; to a ground-based jammer and a detector that would allow their night fighters to home in on the microwave signals. This development was slowed by the German electronic industry&#x27;s decision to stop researching microwaves shortly before &quot;Rotterdam Gerät&quot; literally fell from the sky. Another serious problem was a lack of suitable crystal detectors that were key to the British receiver designs.

Several jammer systems were trialled. The first, known as &quot;Roderich&quot;, was developed by Siemens. These used a transmitter mounted on a tower pointed at the ground, the reflections off the ground spreading the signal out in space where they were picked up by the H2S receivers. Roderich transmissions were timed roughly with the scanning speed of the H2S antenna, causing a pattern to appear similar to a pinwheel that made it difficult to see the ground between its pulses. However, their magnetron was only capable of 5 W of power, giving it very short range. They were so ineffective that they were abandoned in 1944. Another system, &quot;Roland&quot;, used a 50 W klystron, but it was also considered unsuccessful and abandoned around March 1945. Another klystron-based system, &quot;Postklystron&quot;, was designed by the Reichspost and deployed around Leuna.

Two detector systems were ordered: a simple passive system that was essentially just a high-frequency receiver, which became &quot;Naxos&quot;, and a much more sensitive system using its own magnetron as a local oscillator known as &quot;Korfu&quot;. Both required crystal detectors in their receivers, and a crash program to develop them began. These began delivery in a few months, but proved difficult to mass-produce and extremely fragile in the field. This limited the availability of the &quot;Funkgerät&quot; (FuG) 350 Naxos radar detector to a handful of operational examples, which enabled Luftwaffe night fighters to home on the transmissions of H2S. A U version of the same equipment was used to allow U-boats to detect microwave-frequency ASVs.

The RAF remained unaware of the Naxos until the spring of 1944 when a number of intelligence reports suggested the Germans had developed an H2S detector. By this time, the Germans had only a few dozen such detectors in service, but the reports reopened the longstanding debate between the supporters of H2S and those of UK-based navigation systems like Oboe. This corresponded with a period of increased losses among Bomber Command, and there were calls for the system to be abandoned. The matter was debated for months.

The issue was finally settled by a study by Saward. He noted that losses during the Naxos period were actually lower, down from 4% to 2% of the sorties. The drop corresponded with the introduction of Fishpond. Saward concluded that:

In July 1944, a Ju 88G-1 of 7 &quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2 flew the wrong way on a landing beacon and landed at RAF Woodbridge by accident. The crew were arrested before they could destroy their equipment, providing the British researchers with the latest version of the &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; SN-2 VHF-band radar, the Flensburg radar detector, and the FuG 25a Erstling IFF gear. Interrogation of the crew revealed that the Flensburg system detected the RAF bombers&#x27; Monica radar emissions and that it was used as a homing system. Naxos was not fitted, and the crew stated that it was only used for initial warning, not as a homing system. This was all to the great relief of everyone involved; Monica was already being replaced by Fishpond systems on most aircraft, and those aircraft with Monica were told to turn it off. H2S remained in use for the rest of the war.

As the British engineers had predicted, it took the Germans two years to complete the development of magnetron based radars. The first to reach operation in early 1945 was the FuG 240 &quot;Berlin&quot;, an AI radar very similar to the British AI Mk. VIII. By this time the country was on the brink of defeat and &quot;Berlin&quot; never entered service. A small number were fitted experimentally, one of which was captured by the RAF in a shot-down Ju 88. Several other radars developed from the same basic systems were also introduced but saw limited or no service. One advancement made by the Germans during this period was a new type of antenna using a dielectric to shape the output, known in the UK as a &quot;polyrod&quot;.

==Continued developments==

===Improved computers===
In a separate line of development, the RAF was working on a pair of mechanical computers known as the Air Mileage Unit (AMU) and Air Position Indicator (API), which continually performed dead reckoning calculations, greatly reducing navigator workload. This was fed by inputs similar to those for the Mk. XIV bomb sight, namely the estimated wind direction and speed, with the aircraft heading and speed fed in automatically from the aircraft instruments. The system output was a varying voltage that could be used to drive the Mk. XIV bomb sight.

In a development known as Mark IV, H2S was modified to also read these voltages, which offset the centre of the display by an amount proportional to the signals. This would counteract the motion of the aircraft, and &quot;freeze&quot; the display. When initially set up these calculations were never perfect, so some residual drift on the display was normally encountered. The navigator could then fine tune these settings with controls on the display, adjusting them until the image was perfectly still. These values then fed back into the AMU and API, producing highly accurate measurements of the winds aloft. The Mk. IVA used the larger whirligig scanner. None were available by the time the war ended.

===K band===
Further improvements in magnetron and receiver design during the war led to the ability to use even shorter wavelengths, and in the summer of 1943 the decision was made to begin development of versions operating in the K band at 1.25 cm. This would improve the resolution by more than a factor of two over the X band versions, and was especially interesting as a system for low-level bombing where the short local horizon limited the amount of territory visible on the display and would require guidance on smaller objects like particular buildings.

The corollary of this improved resolution was that a K-band system would offer the same resolution as the X-band system with an antenna half the size. Such an antenna would fit on the Mosquito, and development of a scanner began. The Mosquito was already widely used for pinpoint target indicator operations, and fitting them with H2S would further increase their abilities. On 22 February 1944, the development group proposed rapidly fitting Mark IV to all Lancasters, and for higher-accuracy needs, developing either an X-band Whirligig, or a K-band with a smaller antenna. Instead, they were ordered to do both.

The K-band work was given the name &quot;Lion Tamer&quot;. The first test of the basic equipment took place on a Vickers Wellington on 8 May 1944, and Lancaster &quot;ND823&quot; was equipped with the prototype Mark VI and flew on 25 June. However, a meeting on 16 June noted that the range of the K-band sets was not good, with tests in the US reaching only from altitude. Further, production was not ready for large-scale deliveries, and as Dee put it, &quot;the present programme of 100 H2S Mark VI equipments should be regarded as an expression of faith.&quot;

Several new features became part of the Lion Tamer effort. Due to the much higher resolution of the K-band signals, a new display was needed because the dot produced on the older display was too large and overlapped details on either side. A solution was found in the Type 216 display, which featured &quot;sector scan&quot;, which allowed the operator to select one of the eight compass rose points and the display expanded to show only that sector. This effectively doubled the resolution of the display. Meanwhile, work on the new mechanical computers for air navigation was progressing well. It was decided that the Mark VI should be able to connect to these systems. Eventually, all of these changes were rolled up into the proposed Mark VIII.

During the late summer of 1944, as the post-D-Day operations bogged down, there was renewed interest in using the K-band system to detect tactical targets like tanks. Lancaster &quot;JB558&quot; was fit with a 6-foot scanner and a K-band set and began tests at low altitudes between beginning in December 1944. The results were &quot;immediately staggering&quot;, with the displays showing high-quality images of individual buildings, roads, railways and even small streams.

Similar experiments with the smaller 3-foot scanner were not so successful in this role. At a meeting on 16 December, it was decided to move ahead with Lancasters with 6-foot scanners and Mosquitos with 3-foot scanners. This meant the K-band equipment originally planned to be installed on the Pathfinder Force would be used on these aircraft instead. Pathfinder Force received the Mark IIIF X-band equipment instead.

Ultimately, only the Mosquitoes were ready before the war ended, and carried out a total of three target marking operations for the Pathfinder Force. When the war ended and the Lend-Lease program ended with it, the availability of the K-band magnetrons disappeared. Additionally, in high-altitude tests, it was noticed that the signal disappeared in clouds, an observation that would later give rise to weather radar systems, but in the meantime made the system less than useful. The Director of Radar in the Air Ministry decided to embargo all work on the K-band systems for security reasons.

===H2D===

Looking to further improve the navigational aspects of the system, some work was carried out on a system known as H2D, the D for &quot;Doppler&quot;. The idea was that the Doppler shift of the signals due to the motion over the ground could be used to determine the ground speed. In still air, the maximum Doppler shift would be seen dead ahead, but in the presence of any winds aloft, the sideways component would cause the maximum point to shift to an angle, while the head or tail component would make the measured Doppler speed differ from the airspeed indicator. By comparing these measurements to the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed and heading, the wind speed and direction could be accurately calculated.

Testing began at RAF Defford on Wellington &quot;NB822&quot; in early 1944. It became apparent that the sensitivity of the unit was enough that ground traffic like trucks and trains became visible on the display. This is the first example of what is today known as moving target indication, which would theoretically allow an aircraft to scan for targets across a wide area. A second aircraft, &quot;NB823&quot;, joined the effort in June 1944, and then a third (unknown ID).

More rigorous testing demonstrated that the experimental set was only really useful when the aircraft was flying under and had a maximum effective detection range on the order of . Work to improve these numbers was slow going, and the project was eventually relegated to purely experimental with no plans to introduce a service version.

== Post-war ==
After VE day, all models earlier than the Mk. IIIG were declared obsolete, and ongoing work on many of the newer versions ended. In place of the entire series from Mk. VI to VIII came the Mark IX, which was essentially a version of the 3 cm Mk. VIII designed specifically for use on the E3/45 jet bomber, which after becoming B3/45, would finally emerge as the English Electric Canberra.

In contrast to the earlier designs that were added to existing bombers in an external fairing, for E3/45 the radar was designed as an integral part of the aircraft. It was otherwise a relatively straightforward upgrade to the existing Mk. VIII with a much more powerful 200 kW magnetron and numerous other minor changes. A contract was awarded to EMI in 1946 as the Mark IX, but during development it was amended to also equip the much larger B14/46 bomber designs, the V-force. These were essentially identical to the original concept, but used the larger &quot;whirligig&quot; reflector and became the Mk. IXA. Using the larger whirligig reflector and a slotted waveguide allowed the angular beamwidth to be reduced to 1.5 degrees, a great improvement over the World War II models.

The Mk. IX, later known as Mk. 9 when roman numerals were dropped, allowed the scanning rate to be set at 8, 16 or 32 RPM. Additionally, like the K-band models, the IX included the ability to perform a sector scan, limiting the movement of the scanner so instead of performing complete circles it scanned back and forth across a smaller angle. In this case, the idea was not to improve resolution but to provide much more rapid updates of the selected area, which was needed in order to account for the much higher speed of the aircraft. This was especially useful on the V-force, where the radar&#x27;s location in the nose made it difficult to scan to the rear anyway, and at best some 60 to 90 degrees was always blocked. Further limiting the scan to 45 degrees, on-demand, was not a real loss.

The system also added the ability to perform &quot;offset bombing&quot;, a relatively common addition to post-war bombing systems. It was found during operations that the target might not appear on the radar; in these cases, the navigator would select a nearby feature that would be visible, a bend in a river or a radio tower for instance, and measure the angle and distance between it and the target. They would then attempt to guide the aircraft so that the selected aiming feature was in the proper location relative to the centre of the display, by no means a simple task. Offset bombing allowed the navigator to dial these offsets into the display, which caused the entire display to move by that amount. The navigator then guided the aircraft so that the selected feature passed through the centre of the display, which was much easier to arrange.

Through the same period, the API was replaced by the more advanced Navigation and Bombing Computer (NBC), which, when combined with Mk. IX and Green Satin radar, formed the Navigation and Bombing System (NBS). Green Satin made highly accurate and completely automatic measurements of wind speed and direction, allowing the NBC to perform dead reckoning calculations with a very high degree of accuracy. This further automated the navigation process to the point where separate navigators and bomb aimers were no longer needed, and some aircraft were designed with a crew of only two.

Development proceeded at a slower rate due to post-war austerities. Flight testing of the smaller Mk. IX began in 1950 on an Avro Lincoln, followed by the Mk. IXA in 1951 on Handley Page Hastings or Avro Ashton aircraft. As this was too late for the Canberra, which entered service in 1951, early models had to be modified with a conventional glass nose for optical bombing. The Mk. IVA remained in service until 1956 when the Mk. IX finally entered service on the V-force.

The first use of NBS in combat was in 1956, when Vickers Valiants performed long-range strikes on the Egyptian Air Force at Cairo Airport. The system remained in service with the V bomber force (Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor) throughout their lifetime. The last use in combat was made by the Vulcans of the Operation Black Buck flights in 1982 during the Falklands War, which used the system as the primary navigation and bombing aid throughout the round trips to and from Ascension Island. Mk. IX was also used on the Handley Page Victor, the last examples of which left service in 1993.

In 1950 a further requirement for more accurate conventional bombing was raised, demanding accuracy from an aircraft flying at and . This led to the early consideration of a version operating in the Q-band at 8 mm wavelength. An experimental version was constructed in 1951, but in practice the Mk. IX proved useful enough on its own and development was dropped.

In The Princeton Review standardised test preparation courses, &quot;Joe Bloggs&quot; represents the average test-taker, and students are trained to identify the &quot;Joe Bloggs answer&quot;, or the choice which seems right but may be misleading on harder questions.

<doc id="977061" wikidata="Q933951" url="?curid=977061" title="Giga Wing">
<text>is a 1999 vertically scrolling shooter video game developed by Takumi Corporation and published by Capcom for arcades. It was later released for the Dreamcast the same year. The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure&#x27;s &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot;), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter. The Dreamcast version had been scheduled to be released in the U.S. in April 2000, before it was delayed to July 18, 2000. It was later included in &quot;Capcom Arcade Stadium&quot;. 

==Gameplay and plot==

&quot;Giga Wing&quot; takes place during a fictional war within a steampunk setting. The player controls one of four different futuristic aircraft and must destroy enemy aircraft, tanks, ships, and buildings using both guns and missiles mounted on the aircraft and a limited supply of bombs which damage or destroy all enemies on-screen when used. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the &quot;Stranger&quot; is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World War II, and the players fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He appears to be a friend of Stuck 30 years ago when the players fight him with Stuck.

There are four different characters in the game: Sinnosuke, Ruby, Isha, and Stuck and each of them has their own individual storyline. Players can also do team play mode that has two characters at once, creating a new storyline. In each storyline, there are two endings. In the bad ending, the character the player uses will sacrifice their life in a kamikaze attack that destroys the Medallion. In team up mode, generally one of the character does this, but sometimes both characters survive. In the good endings for either solo or team play, the characters do not sacrifice themselves.

The player chooses one of four different craft and shoots through seven stages. Each level ends with a boss fight and each game begins with three lives. The option to continue is given when all lives are lost, although the seventh stage is only accessible if the player does not use any continues. Each ship in &quot;Giga Wing&quot; has three attacks: a normal shot (spray of bullets), reflect (reflects enemy bullets and damages enemy ships in the field), and force bomb (nullifies all on-screen bullets). Defeated ships sometimes drop power-ups. Each ship starts out with two bombs and up to seven can be collected. Each bomb left in reserve after any boss fight gives the player a bonus. Players can increase their score multiplier by collecting medals dropped by defeated ships. Player &quot;rank&quot; is determined by score at the end of each level. The game adjusts the difficulty accordingly.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;Game Informer&quot; gave the game a favorable review, and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a mixed review, both while the game was still in development. Jim Preston of &quot;NextGen&quot; said that the game &quot;should be packaged with bottles of both Visine and Excedrin.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their May 1, 1999 issue as the tenth most-successful arcade game of the month.

Air officers holding command appointments receive the title Air Officer Commanding (AOC), whereas air officers holding commander-in-chief positions are titled as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C).

==British usage==
In the British Armed Forces, where the term originated, an air officer is equivalent in concept to flag officer and general officer in the Royal Navy and Army respectively. Specifically, while the Army uses General Officer Commanding (GOC), the Air Force uses Air Officer Commanding (AOC) to designate the senior officer in a formation.

Note, however, that in the British Armed Forces, while an air commodore is an air officer, their Royal Navy equivalent (commodore) is not considered a flag officer, nor is the British Army or Royal Marines equivalent (brigadier) considered a general officer. In 1919 when the RAF introduced its own air officer ranks, the preceding RAF and equivalent army rank was brigadier-general, which was a general officer rank until its abolition in 1922. In some other countries — most notably the armed forces of the United States — Army, Air Force and Marine Corps one-star officers are considered to be general officers, and one-star officers of the Navy and Coast Guard are considered to be flag officers.

There are multiple air officer command appointments. Additionally the RAF maintains two home country air officer appointments. These are Air Officer Scotland and the Air Officer for Wales.

On ceremonial occasions, many RAF air officers are entitled to wear embellished shoulder boards and the gold and blue sash. This applies to all officers at or above the rank of air vice-marshal and holders of the following air commodore posts:

*Commandant of the Royal Air Force College Cranwell
*Air Officer Scotland 
*Air Officer Northern Ireland
*Air Officer Wales

With the exception of marshals of the RAF, the embellished shoulder boards feature the golden air officers&#x27; eagle and wreath device surmounted by a lion statant guardant. For marshals of the RAF, the embellished shoulder boards display the air officer&#x27;s eagle and wreath, two crossed marshal&#x27;s batons and, since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the St Edward&#x27;s Crown representing royal authority. Prior to 1953, the Tudor Crown (sometimes called the King&#x27;s Crown) was used.

==Air officer ranks==
The air officer ranks are as follows:
==National usage==
The air officer terminology is currently used by the following air forces:

*Bangladesh Air Force
*Indian Air Force
*Namibian Air Force
*Nigerian Air Force
*Pakistan Air Force
*Sri Lanka Air Force
*Royal Air Force
*Royal Australian Air Force
*Royal New Zealand Air Force
*Air Force of Zimbabwe

<text>Lattice QCD is a well-established non-perturbative approach to solving the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) theory of quarks and gluons. It is a lattice gauge theory formulated on a grid or lattice of points in space and time. When the size of the lattice is taken infinitely large and its sites infinitesimally close to each other, the continuum QCD is recovered.
Analytic or perturbative solutions in low-energy QCD are hard or impossible to obtain due to the highly nonlinear nature of the strong force and the large coupling constant at low energies. This formulation of QCD in discrete rather than continuous spacetime naturally introduces a momentum cut-off at the order 1/&quot;a&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the lattice spacing, which regularizes the theory. As a result, lattice QCD is mathematically well-defined. Most importantly, lattice QCD provides a framework for investigation of non-perturbative phenomena such as confinement and quark–gluon plasma formation, which are intractable by means of analytic field theories.

In lattice QCD, fields representing quarks are defined at lattice sites (which leads to fermion doubling), while the gluon fields are defined on the links connecting neighboring sites. This approximation approaches continuum QCD as the spacing between lattice sites is reduced to zero. Because the computational cost of numerical simulations increases as the lattice spacing decreases, results must be extrapolated to &quot;a = 0&quot; (the continuum limit) by repeated calculations at different lattice spacings &quot;a&quot;.

Numerical lattice QCD calculations using Monte Carlo methods can be extremely computationally intensive, requiring the use of the largest available supercomputers. To reduce the computational burden, the so-called quenched approximation can be used, in which the quark fields are treated as non-dynamic &quot;frozen&quot; variables. While this was common in early lattice QCD calculations, &quot;dynamical&quot; fermions are now standard. These simulations typically utilize algorithms based upon molecular dynamics or microcanonical ensemble algorithms.

At present, lattice QCD is primarily applicable at low densities where the numerical sign problem does not interfere with calculations. Monte Carlo methods are free from the sign problem when applied to the case of QCD with gauge group SU(2) (QC2D).

Lattice QCD has already successfully agreed with many experiments. For example, the mass of the proton has been determined theoretically with an error of less than 2 percent. Lattice QCD predicts that the transition from confined quarks to quark–gluon plasma occurs around a temperature of (), within the range of experimental measurements.

Lattice QCD has also been used as a benchmark for high-performance computing, an approach originally developed in the context of the IBM Blue Gene supercomputer.

==Techniques==

===Monte-Carlo simulations===

Monte-Carlo is a method to pseudo-randomly sample a large space of variables.
The importance sampling technique used to select the gauge configurations in the Monte-Carlo simulation imposes the use of Euclidean time, by a Wick rotation of spacetime.

In lattice Monte-Carlo simulations the aim is to calculate correlation functions. This is done by explicitly calculating the action, using field configurations which are chosen according to the distribution function, which depends on the action and the fields. Usually one starts with the gauge bosons part and gauge-fermion interaction part of the action to calculate the gauge configurations, and then uses the simulated gauge configurations to calculate hadronic propagators and correlation functions.

===Fermions on the lattice===
Lattice QCD is a way to solve the theory exactly from first principles, without any assumptions, to the desired precision. However, in practice the calculation power is limited, which requires a smart use of the available resources. One needs to choose an action which gives the best physical description of the system, with minimum errors, using the available computational power. The limited computer resources force one to use approximate physical constants which are different from their true physical values:
* The lattice discretization means approximating continuous and infinite space-time by a finite lattice spacing and size. The smaller the lattice, and the bigger the gap between nodes, the bigger the error. Limited resources commonly force the use of smaller physical lattices and larger lattice spacing than wanted, leading to larger errors than wanted.
* The quark masses are also approximated. Quark masses are larger than experimentally measured. These have been steadily approaching their physical values, and within the past few years a few collaborations have used nearly physical values to extrapolate down to physical values.

In order to compensate for the errors one improves the lattice action in various ways, to minimize mainly finite spacing errors.

===Lattice perturbation theory===
In lattice perturbation theory the scattering matrix is expanded in powers of the lattice spacing, &quot;a&quot;. The results are used primarily to renormalize Lattice QCD Monte-Carlo calculations. In perturbative calculations both the operators of the action and the propagators are calculated on the lattice and expanded in powers of &quot;a&quot;. When renormalizing a calculation, the coefficients of the expansion need to be matched with a common continuum scheme, such as the MS-bar scheme, otherwise the results cannot be compared. The expansion has to be carried out to the same order in the continuum scheme and the lattice one.

The lattice regularization was initially introduced by Wilson as a framework for studying strongly coupled theories non-perturbatively. However, it was found to be a regularization suitable also for perturbative calculations. Perturbation theory involves an expansion in the coupling constant, and is well-justified in high-energy QCD where the coupling constant is small, while it fails completely when the coupling is large and higher order corrections are larger than lower orders in the perturbative series. In this region non-perturbative methods, such as Monte-Carlo sampling of the correlation function, are necessary.

Lattice perturbation theory can also provide results for condensed matter theory. One can use the lattice to represent the real atomic crystal. In this case the lattice spacing is a real physical value, and not an artifact of the calculation which has to be removed (a UV regulator), and a quantum field theory can be formulated and solved on the physical lattice.

===Quantum computing===
The U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) lattice gauge theories can be reformulated into a form that can be simulated using &quot;spin qubit manipulations&quot; on a universal quantum computer.

==Limitations==
The method suffers from a few limitations:
* Currently there is no formulation of lattice QCD that allows us to simulate the real-time dynamics of a quark-gluon system such as quark–gluon plasma.
* It is computationally intensive, with the bottleneck not being flops but the bandwidth of memory access.
* Computations of observables at nonzero baryon density suffer from a sign problem, preventing direct computations of thermodynamic quantities.

<text>Australian Eggs (AE) is the major marketer of eggs in Australia. It is a producer-owned corporation, representing approximately 400 commercial egg producers and is based in Sydney. The activities of AE include marketing, research and development, and policy services. According to its website, it runs public awareness campaigns on animal welfare, nutrition, and vaccine development. However, it has received criticism from animal welfare organisations for using these terms for promotional purposes. The corporation is affiliated with the International Egg Commission (IEC).

AE was created by an act of federal parliament in 2002 as a statutory authority to replace the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, as the peak egg body in the country.

In September 2004, the corporation hosted the Annual Conference of the IEC in Sydney. It was awarded the International body&#x27;s most prestigious prize, the Golden Egg Award. At the same presentation night, the Australian egg industry was judged as the best in the world by an international judging panel.

In July 2005, the corporation funded a trip for Brian Spotts of Colorado, to break the world record of standing eggs on end. 

In 2013, consumer rights organisation Choice made a super-complaint against AE after it proposed to change the definition for free range eggs in Australia from 2,000 hens per hectare to 10,000 hens per hectare. In 2014, AE was fined $30,000 for faking an egg shortage during an oversupply to boost their profits.

<doc id="977079" wikidata="Q7287446" url="?curid=977079" title="Ralph Eichler">
<text>Ralph Eichler (born March 23, 1950) is a retired Canadian politician. From 2003 until 2023, he was the member of Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the riding of Lakeside.

== Early life and career ==
Before entering provincial politics, Eichler served for eight years as the administrator of the Interlake School Division. He also owned and operated Prairie Farm Ranch Supply, an exporter of livestock handling equipment. In the latter capacity, he oversaw the invention of a device known as &quot;The Stockdoctor&quot;, now used internationally. Eichler has also served as a director of the Prairie Implements Manufacturers Association and the Teulon Golf and Country Club, as well as serving as president of the Interlake Riding Club.

== Political career ==
In the 2003 Manitoba general election, Eichler was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a Progressive Conservative, defeating New Democrat Robert Marshall by 4,102 votes to 3,012. He was only the third person to hold the riding in 81 years. For the first 47 years after the creation of the district, Douglas Lloyd Campbell had represented it, and following Campbell&#x27;s retirement, Harry Enns represented it for 34 years. Eichler himself was nominated and elected following Enns&#x27; retirement.

The NDP government was re-elected in 2003, and Eichler sat in opposition until 2016.

He was re-elected in the 2007, 2011, and 2016 provincial elections.

On May 3, 2016, after the new Progressive Conservative government under the leadership of Brian Pallister was sworn in, Eichler was appointed to the Executive Council of Manitoba as Minister of Agriculture.

He was re-elected in the 2019 election.

On October 4, 2022 he announced he would not seek re-election in the 43rd provincial election and would serve the rest of his term. He retired with the call of the 2023 election.

<text>An exhibition game (also known as a friendly, scrimmage, demonstration, training match, pre-season game, warmup match, or preparation match, depending at least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player&#x27;s or the team&#x27;s rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced. Exhibition games often serve as &quot;warm-up matches&quot;, particularly in many team sports where these games help coaches and managers select and condition players, before the competitive matches of a league season or tournament. If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other. The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.

An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, to promote the sport, to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player, or to raise money for charities. Several sports leagues hold all-star games to showcase their best players against each other, while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world. International competitions like the Olympic Games may also hold exhibition games as part of a demonstration sport.

==Association football==

In the early days of association football, friendlies were the most common type of match. However, with the development of The Football League in England in 1888, league and cup tournaments became the primary methods of competition. The significance of friendly matches thus declined since the 19th century: by 2000, national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world, with local or regional leagues for lower-level teams.

===Club football===
Since the introduction of league football, most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies). Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are mostly used to &quot;warm up&quot; players for a new season/competitive match. Some rules may be changed or experimented with, such as unlimited substitutions (which allow teams to play less experienced players). Frequently such games take place between a large club and nearby smaller clubs, such as those between Newcastle United and Gateshead, or on a large club on an international tour against local opponents. Since the 2000s, friendlies played in the United States have become increasingly lucrative for European teams.

Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged between the clubs in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy, International Champions Cup and the Amsterdam Tournament. Although these events may involve sponsorship deals, a trophy, and television broadcasts, there is little prestige attached to them. In addition, club teams may tour other continents as part of global branding campaigns.

===International football===

International teams also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments. This is essential, since national squads generally have much less time together in which to prepare. The biggest difference between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons, not between them. This has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations and clubs as to the availability of players, who could become injured or fatigued in a friendly.

International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad. Players can be booked in international friendlies, and can be suspended from future international matches based on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period. Caps and goals scored also count towards a player&#x27;s career records. The results can play a part in affecting the country&#x27;s FIFA ranking. In 2004, FIFA ruled that substitutions by a team be limited to six per match in international friendlies in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match. An international match loses its official status if this regulation is breached.

Matches in multinational football tournaments such as the King&#x27;s Cup, the Kirin Cup, Intercontinental Cup and the China Cup are usually considered international friendlies by FIFA.

===Fundraising game===
In the UK and Ireland, &quot;exhibition match&quot; and &quot;friendly match&quot; refer to two different types of games. The types described above as friendlies are not termed exhibition matches, all-star matches such as those held in the US Major League Soccer, Japan&#x27;s J.League or South Korea&#x27;s K League are called exhibition matches rather than friendly matches. A one-off match for charitable fundraising, usually involving one or two all-star teams, or a match held in honor of a player for contribution to their club, may also be described as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as charity matches (Soccer Aid, Team UNICEF etc.) and testimonial matches respectively.

===Training game===
A training game is generally a non-competitive football match played between two sides usually as part of a training exercise or to give players match practice. Managers may also use bounce games as an opportunity to observe a player in action before offering a contract. Usually these games are played on a training ground rather than in a stadium with no spectators in attendance.

==Bandy==
Before the establishment of the Bandy World Championship in 1957, annually held friendly games were the main events for national teams of the sport. International friendlies are still often held.

==Boxing==
Exhibition fights were once common in boxing. Jack Dempsey fought many exhibition bouts after retiring. Joe Louis fought a charity fight on his rematch with Buddy Baer, but this was not considered an exhibition as it was for Louis&#x27; world Heavyweight title, and as a championship fight, it counted on both boxers&#x27; records. Muhammad Ali fought many exhibitions, including one with Lyle Alzado. In more modern times, Mike Tyson, Julio César Chávez, Jorge Castro, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. have been involved in exhibition fights.

Although not fought for profit, amateur bouts (usually) and sparring sessions are not considered to be exhibition fights. On 25 August 2018, YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI had an exhibition match that ended in a draw. On 28 November 2020, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. had a fight that ended in a draw. 

==Ice hockey==
Prior to the 1917–18 NHL season, an exhibition game was played on 15 December, between the Montreal Canadiens and the Montreal Wanderers. The game was played as a benefit to aid victims of the Halifax explosion.

Under the 1995–2004 National Hockey League collective bargaining agreement, teams were limited to nine preseason games. From 1975 to 1991, NHL teams sometimes played exhibition games against teams from the Soviet Union in the Super Series, and in 1978, played against World Hockey Association teams also in preseason training. Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams, often at a club&#x27;s minor league affiliate (e.g. Carolina Hurricanes games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, home of their AHL affiliate the Charlotte Checkers; Los Angeles Kings games at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, home of their AHL affiliate the Ontario Reign; Montreal Canadiens games at Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 1995; Washington Capitals at 1st Mariner Arena in the Baltimore Hockey Classic; Buffalo Sabres at Pegula Ice Arena on the campus of owner Terrence Pegula&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot; Penn State University; various Western Canada teams at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, a potential NHL expansion venue; and the St. Louis Blues in Kansas City, Missouri at T-Mobile Center, also a potential expansion venue that is currently considered part of the Blues&#x27; television market). 

Before the Vegas Golden Knights entered the NHL in 2017, the Kings would traditionally play an annual game known as Frozen Fury in Las Vegas in a partnership with the MGM Grand Las Vegas. The game was then played at Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, before it ended in 2024 due to the arrival of the expansion Utah Hockey Club. Today, all teams must play six, seven, or eight preseason games. Each preseason game must have at least eight veterans dressed, except during the World Cup of Hockey. In the 1994–95 season and the 2012–13 season, no preseason games were played due to lockouts.

Since the 2000s, some preseason games have been played in Europe against European teams, as part of the NHL Challenge and NHL Premiere series. In addition to the standard preseason, there also exist prospect tournaments such as the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; YoungStars tournament and the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; training camp, in which NHL teams&#x27; younger prospects face off against each other under their parent club&#x27;s banner.

In 1992, goaltender Manon Rhéaume played in a preseason game for the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the first woman to suit up for an all-male pro sports team in North America.

The Flying Fathers, a Canadian group of Catholic priests, regularly toured North America playing exhibition hockey games for charity. One of the organization&#x27;s founders, Les Costello, was a onetime NHL player who was ordained as a priest after retiring from professional hockey. Another prominent exhibition hockey team is the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team, which is composed almost entirely of retired NHL players, the majority of whom (as the name suggests) played at least a portion of their career for the Buffalo Sabres.

American college hockey teams occasionally play exhibition games against Canadian college teams as well as against USA or Canadian national teams. (In men&#x27;s hockey, the senior national teams are selected from NHL and other pro players, and college teams would be overmatched against those teams even if they were allowed to play them. However, the national under-18 teams are made up of amateurs, allowing college squads to play them.)

==Baseball==

The Major League Baseball&#x27;s preseason is also known as spring training. All MLB teams maintain a spring-training base in Arizona or Florida. The teams in Arizona make up the Cactus League, while the teams in Florida play in the Grapefruit League. Each team plays about 30 preseason games against other MLB teams. They may also play exhibitions against a local college team, a minor-league team from their farm system, or even a national baseball team representing a country. Some days feature the team playing two games with two different rosters evenly divided up, which are known as &quot;split-squad&quot; games.

Several MLB teams used to play regular exhibition games during the year against nearby teams in the other major league, but regular-season interleague play has made such games unnecessary. The two Canadian MLB teams, the Toronto Blue Jays of the American League and the Montreal Expos of the National League, met annually to contest the Pearson Cup; this tradition ended when the Expos moved to Washington DC for the 2005 season. Similarly, the New York Yankees played in the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game against various local rivals from 1946 to 1983.

It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare. Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues, like Chicago&#x27;s Crosstown Classic and New York&#x27;s Subway Series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play. The annual MLB All-Star Game, played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, had long been considered an exhibition match, though between 2003 and 2016 this status was questioned because the league whose team won the All-Star game had been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming World Series (prior to 2003 the leagues alternated which one of them had home field advantage; starting in 2017 the team with the better regular season record would be given home field advantage).

Another exhibition game, the Hall of Fame Game/Classic which was played in Cooperstown, New York on the weekend of inductions to the Baseball Hall of Fame, was also ended in 2008 due to interleague play and teams playing only substitutes.

==Basketball==

===Professional basketball===
National Basketball Association teams usually play eight preseason games per year, with the number rarely being lower than seven. Today, NBA teams almost always play each other in the preseason but often at neutral sites within their market areas in order to allow those who can not usually make a trip to a home team&#x27;s arena during the regular season to see a game close to home; for instance, the Minnesota Timberwolves will play games in arenas in North and South Dakota, while the Phoenix Suns schedule one exhibition game outdoors at Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California, yearly, the only such instance an NBA game takes place in an outdoor venue. Exhibition games have also been held on occasion outside the US and Canada.

However, from 1971 to 1975, NBA teams played preseason exhibitions against American Basketball Association teams with the ABA winning the series 80 to 75 games. In the early days of the NBA, league clubs sometimes challenged the legendary barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters, with mixed success. The Minneapolis Lakers beat the Globetrotters seven games to one. The NBA has played preseason games in Europe and Asia. Beginning in 2015, the league has scheduled NBA Africa Games with players of direct African descent against players from the rest of the league; the NBA has also played against teams in Australia&#x27;s National Basketball League. In the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the NBA and the primary European club competition, the Euroleague, conducted a preseason tournament featuring two NBA teams and the finalists from that year&#x27;s Euroleague. In the 1998–99 and 2011–12 seasons, teams were limited to only two preseason games due to lockouts.

The annual NBA All-Star Game is an exhibition game.

Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association teams play up to three preseasons games per year. WNBA teams will play each other and will also play women&#x27;s national basketball teams. Most years, the WNBA also stages an All-Star Game, but this game is canceled if pre-empted by major international competitions such as the Olympic Games.

===College basketball===
Traditionally, major college basketball teams began their seasons with a few exhibition games. They played traveling teams made up of former college players on teams such as Athletes in Action or a team sponsored by Marathon Petroleum. On occasion before 1992, when FIBA allowed professional players on foreign national teams, colleges played those teams in exhibitions. However, in 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association banned games with non-college teams. Some teams have begun scheduling exhibition games against teams in NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and the NAIA, or even against colleges and universities located in Canada. Major college basketball teams still travel to other countries during the summer to play in exhibition games, although a college team is allowed only one foreign tour every four years and a maximum of ten games in each tour.

==American football==

===Professional football===

The National Football League teams play three preseason games a year, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fourth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game (previously before the 2021 season expansion, four games). These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited.

The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league&#x27;s popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 between the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets and the Seaboard Football League&#x27;s Long Island Chiefs and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976.

Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it. The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2010 played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.
The Arena Football League briefly had a two-game exhibition season in the early 2000s, a practice that ended in 2003 with a new television contract. Exhibition games outside of a structured season are relatively common among indoor American football leagues; because teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play, it is not uncommon to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams that are from another league, about to join the league as a probational franchise, or a semi-pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule.

===College and high school football===
Many college football teams, particularly larger organizations, play a public intramural exhibition game in the spring mainly to promote the team and give new recruits an early chance at public game action. Many of these intramural games are nationally televised, though not to the same level of prominence as intercollegiate play. In college sports the commonly used term for the major scrimmage at the end of spring practice is the &quot;Spring Game.&quot;

True exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football; due to the importance of opinion polling in the top level of college football, even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled. Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes.

High school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but full exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances, travel and player injuries, along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of August in most school districts under the traditional September–June academic term. Some states hold preseason events known as &quot;jamborees&quot; in which several pairs of high school football squads take turns playing one half (usually 24 minutes of game time) to give players some experience before the first official game. Another high school football exhibition contest is the all-star game, which usually brings together top players from a region. These games are typically played by graduating seniors after the regular season or in the summer. Many of these games, which include the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and Under Armour All-America Game, are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges and increase their college recruiting profile, or for athletes to confirm their choice and sign their National Letter of Intent outside of National Signing Day.

=== Teams outside North America===
Outside North America, teams will sometimes organize exhibition games as part of their pre season preparations – German Football League teams for example often schedule games against second or third tier opponents ahead of their regular season. Exhibition games are also sometimes scheduled between teams from different countries which would otherwise never play each other – including on occasion between non-North American teams and North American college teams. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic leading to the cancellation of regular league play in many places, some teams scheduled exhibition games instead, including the Dresden Monarchs hosting the Wroclaw Panthers on September 20, 2020.

==Canadian football==
Teams in the Canadian Football League play two exhibition games each year, in June. Exhibition games in the CFL have taken on great importance to coaching staff and players alike in that they are used as a final stage of training camp and regular season rosters are finalized after the exhibition games, which are generally referred to as &quot;pre-season&quot; play.

==Rugby union==

During the amateur era, there was only a limited number of rugby union competitions between national teams. Therefore, matches between national teams are never considered &quot;exhibitions&quot; or &quot;friendlies&quot;, as they always have Test match status.

National teams sometimes play exhibition matches versus invitational teams like the Barbarian F.C. and Barbarian Rugby Club. Also, rugby union clubs sometimes play preseason matches.

==Australian rules football==
Australian rules football has been introduced to a wide range of places around Australia and the world since the code originated in Victoria in 1859. Much of this expansion can be directly attributed to exhibition matches by the major leagues in regions and countries where the code has been played as a demonstration sport.

==Auto racing==
Various auto racing organizations hold non-championship exhibition events; these events usually award no championship points to participants, but they do offer prize money to participants. The NASCAR Cup Series holds two exhibition events annually – the Busch Clash, held at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at the start of the season, and the All-Star Race, held at North Wilkesboro Speedway midway through the season. Both events carry a hefty purse of over US$1,000,000. NASCAR has also held exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi in Japan and Calder Park Thunderdome in Australia.

Other historical examples of non-championship races include the Marlboro Challenge in IndyCar racing and the TOCA Touring Car Shootout in the British Touring Car Championship. Until the mid-1980s there were also a significant number of non-championship Formula One races.

The National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock teams will have a preseason drag meet held before the traditional start in Pomona. The Pro Stock Showdown is a preseason drag meet held for the Pro Stock teams held at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

==Sumo==

In sumo wrestling, official tournaments (honbasho) are held six times per year, in the cities of Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Fukuoka. In between the tournaments, regional tours known as jungyō (巡業) are undertaken to bring sumo wrestling to more regions of Japan. In addition to exhibition bouts, there are &quot;demonstrations of hairdressing, comedy sumo and sumo singing&quot;, as well as opportunities for fans to meet with wrestlers and for sumo stables to find new recruits.

<text>The Naxos radar warning receiver was a World War II German countermeasure to S band microwave radar produced by a cavity magnetron. Introduced in September 1943, it replaced Metox, which was incapable of detecting centimetric radar. Two versions were widely used, the FuG 350 Naxos Z that allowed night fighters to home in on H2S radars carried by RAF Bomber Command aircraft, and the FuMB 7 Naxos U for U-boats, offering early warning of the approach of RAF Coastal Command patrol aircraft equipped with ASV Mark III radar. A later model, Naxos ZR, provided warning of the approach of RAF night fighters equipped with AI Mk. VIII radar.

==Background==
Prior to the introduction of the cavity magnetron, radar systems used traditional vacuum tube electronics and were limited to about 1.5 m wavelength in UK use, and as low as 50 cm in German systems. Both could receive the transmissions of their opposing radar systems and radar warning receivers were widely used by both sides in a number of roles.

By 1942, the UK had made enough progress on the magnetron to begin introducing new radars using it, including the AI Mk. VIII radar for night fighters, ASV Mk. III radar for sea-surface search (anti-submarine) and the H2S radar for bomber guidance. None of the existing German receivers could operate at the magnetron&#x27;s 10 cm wavelength, and the introduction of the ASV Mk. III, in particular, led to significant losses among the U-boat fleet during the summer of 1943.

Before the magnetron had been deployed operationally, there was a great debate in the UK over whether or not Bomber Command should be allowed to use it. Unlike other types of tube electronics of the era, which are quite fragile, the main component of the magnetron is a large block of copper. If an aircraft carrying one were shot down and recovered, there was a very good chance the block would survive, at which point the secret would be revealed to anyone familiar with microwave techniques. This is precisely what occurred on the night of 2/3 February 1943, when the second mission to attempt to use H2S led to one of the Short Stirling bombers carrying it being shot down near Rotterdam. The magnetron was recovered and this &quot;Rotterdam Gerät&quot; (gadget, or device) led to the rapid formation of a study group to exploit it.

The group first met at the Telefunken offices in Berlin on 22 February. Although the possibility of developing radars using it was considered, the much more pressing need was the development of countermeasures to this now-undetectable radar. This effect was hampered by the industry&#x27;s recent decision to give up on microwave research, considering it to be a dead-end, as had British engineers before the introduction of the magnetron. Adding to their problems was the lack of a suitable rugged crystal detector, which was the only system able to reliably detect these high frequency signals. Enormous effort was expended to address these problems, and prototype units were available by the summer.

==Aircraft use==
The first operational use was in a Junkers Ju 88 on 2 September 1943. The unit, and others that were delivered during this time, proved extremely difficult to keep working. Even when they did work, their angle accuracy was limited, and it did not provide elevation or range information of any sort. Operators found it useful for finding the bomber stream, at ranges as great as , but could not use it to home in on individual aircraft. The &quot;Naxos Z&quot; system&#x27;s rotating antenna for airborne use was driven by a DC motor, and comprised what appear to be a pair of vacuum tubes laid flat on a circular rotating carriage, which would be enclosed within a radome of either hemispherical shape for single-engine fighter use, or in a more aerodynamic &quot;teardrop&quot; shape for placement atop a twin-engined night fighter&#x27;s canopy.

News of the device made its way to England, where some level of panic broke out when it was suggested that the H2S could be leading to the aircraft&#x27;s demise. Arguments over the use of H2S by bomber command started anew. These were finally put to rest in July 1944 when a Naxos-equipped Ju 88 night fighter became lost and landed in the UK. The crew described the operation of Naxos as being of little overall use, while another device, &quot;Flensburg&quot; was able to home in on individual aircraft&#x27;s Monica radar. Monica was removed from service and H2S was allowed to continue throughout the war.

When it was clear that the magnetron was known to the Germans, the RAF released its night fighter version, AI Mk. VIII radar, for use over Europe. This radar provided a significant advantage to the RAF over the older systems used by the Germans, and for the first time the RAF was able to seriously disrupt German night fighter operations by attacking them directly. Aircraft that did survive reported that there was no warning of the attack, and it was quickly surmised that the RAF had introduced a new microwave AI radar. This led to the rapid introduction of the Naxos ZR, tuned to the Mk. VIII&#x27;s frequency and equipped with rearward facing antennas.

Altogether, about 700 Naxos Z and ZR&#x27;s were produced.

==Submarine use==
Given the concerns over the possibility of losing a magnetron to the Germans, for some time through the summer of 1942 the RAF limited future deliveries to Coastal Command aircraft for anti-submarine duties, where the possibility of capture was remote. However, Bomber Command fought this decision and by the time deliveries started late in the year they received all of the units. This was reconsidered once again when it was becoming clear the U-boats had been equipped with some sort of detector for the existing ASV Mk. II radar, as they could be seen disappearing on the radar as the aircraft approached, and this was put to fearsome use in early 1943. A new agreement was reached where Coastal and Bomber Command would split the deliveries about 65/35.

When the first of these ASV Mk. III radar systems began reaching service in early 1943, the effects were profound. Once again British aircraft could attack submarines with no warning until the last seconds when the Leigh light was illuminated, far too late for the submarine to take defensive action. A new phase started where British aircraft pressed into the Bay of Biscay and German submarines were told to remain on the surface and fight it out in daylight rather than risk almost certain death at night. This led to a crash program to equip their fleet with a variation of Naxos that could detect the new radar.

The resulting Naxos U initially proved to have very short detection range, too short to be really useful. This led to a series of new antenna designs before the final &quot;Fliege&quot; (fly) semi-parabolic system was introduced. This had the distinct disadvantage that it was not waterproof and had to be removed from its mounting and taken inside in order to dive. Even with this antenna, warning times were on the order of one minute. An even later version, Naxos ZM, spun the antenna at 1,300 RPM to display the angle directly on a cathode-ray tube display in the submarine. This was still under development when the war ended.

Although Naxos was useful against ASV Mk. III, by 1944 the British and US were already well on their way to introducing newer magnetron-based radar systems, like the American H2X, operating at even higher frequencies in the 3 cm band. The first of these ASV Mk. VI radars were being introduced to service just as Naxos was being fitted. As a result, Naxos never had as great a success as the &quot;Metox&quot; it replaced.

==Other developments==
Experiments with a ground-based version of Naxos using directional antennas had been carried out under the name &quot;Corfu&quot;. Some effort was made to develop this into an airborne version, FuG 351 Corfu Z, but this never entered service.

An attempt to address the limited resolution of Naxos was undertaken in the Korfu, which had a better antenna system and more sensitive receiver.

Naxos receivers were also combined with the parabolic antennas from Würzburg radar systems to produce a long-range receiver tuned to the British Oboe radio navigation system. The system later used a Domeyer receiver and became the Naxburg system. Oboe broadcast pulses from the aircraft that needed to be powerful enough to be received by ground stations in the UK. This made them relatively easy to pick out at short ranges, as long as the receiver was tuned to a suitable frequency. When such a signal was detected, false pulses identical to those received from the aircraft were re-broadcast from the ground. Stations in the UK thus received two or more signals for every signal they sent out, which confused the detectors.

<text>Lakeside is a provincial electoral division in Manitoba, Canada. It is located to the immediate northwest of the city of Winnipeg.

Traditionally a rural riding, Lakeside has become more urban in recent years (as a result of both electoral redistribution and changes in demography). All the same, agriculture accounted for 17 per cent of the riding&#x27;s industry in 1999. The riding is bordered to the north by Interlake, to the west by Portage la Prairie, to the south by Morris and to the east by Gimli. It also borders the city of Winnipeg to the southeast.

There are no major urban centres in the riding. Communities include Argyle, Balmoral, Rosser, Gunton, Stonewall, Stony Mountain, Teulon, Warren, Woodlands and Inwood.

Lakeside&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,473. The average family income in 1999 was Can$49,774, with an unemployment rate of 6.10 per cent. Eight per cent of the population is of a German background, and 8 per cent are aboriginal.

Lakeside was created by provincial redistribution in 1886. It has traditionally elected representatives of agrarian interests, both of the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties. It is presently a comfortably safe seat for the Tories, who have held it without interruption since 1969. Since 1922, only four men have held the seat.

Lakeside&#x27;s best-known Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Douglas Campbell, represented the constituency for 47 years, first as a Progressive, then as a Liberal-Progressive, then as a Liberal—longer than anyone in provincial history. He served as premier from 1949 to 1958.

<text>The Kaban Lakes (; ) are a system of lakes in Kazan, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia that includes Nizhny (Blizhny) Kaban, Verkhny Kaban, and Sredny Kaban. They make up Tatarstan&#x27;s largest lake, measuring 1.86 square kilometers (0.72 square miles) in total.

The lakes are connected with the Kazanka River by the Bolaq channel and a subterranean channel from Bolaq-Kazansu. The city&#x27;s sewage system also connects them to the Volga River.

The Thousandth Anniversary of Islam Mosque is situated on the bank.

== Etymology ==
Also in Kazan there is a famous &quot;Kaban Lake&quot; similar to the name of the &quot;Kuban River&quot; - which translates from Nogai as &quot;overflowing&quot;. The name originated in the 14th century with the Kipchak Tatars who came to these places, especially Astrakhan Nogais. The main now central Bauman Street that leads to the Kremlin is one of the oldest streets in Kazan. In the era of the Kazan Khanate, it was called the Nogai district.

<text>Berry Enfield Johnston (born September 25, 1935) is an American professional poker player. He is best known as the 1986 World Champion, but he has also won four other bracelets at the World Series of Poker in addition to cashes and wins in many other tournaments throughout his career.

== Poker career ==
Johnston won the 1986 World Series of Poker Main Event, and placed third in 1983 and 1985 and fifth in the 1990 World Series, respectively. He has made at least 29 final tables at the WSOP and has finished in the money on at least 66 occasions. He has also cashed ten times in the WSOP Main Event, more than any other player. His most recent cash in the Main Event came in 2007, when he finished in 113th place in a field of over six thousand players, for which Johnston won $58,570. Having cashed in at least one event every year from 1982–2010, Johnston holds the record at the WSOP for longest cashing streak at 29 years.

Johnston cashed three times in the 2008 World Series of Poker, including tenth place in an Omaha Hi/Lo event.

Johnston has also played on the NBC &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; Series, most recently in 2008 among some of his fellow World Series of Poker Main Event Champions. Berry finished fourth in the tournament, which was won by Johnny Chan. The other world champions in the tournament were Phil Hellmuth, Huck Seed, Chris Ferguson, and Jamie Gold.

He was inducted into the Seniors Poker Hall of Fame in the early 1990s and Poker Hall of Fame in 2004. Johnston was the only inductee in the 2004 class.

As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $3,450,000. His 60 cashes as the WSOP account for $2,075,527 of those winnings.

<text>William Hall Barnett (c. 1802 – August 1865) is described as a &#x27;founder&#x27; in his 1836 patent, and an &#x27;ironfounder&#x27; in his 1838 patent, and later as an engineer and gas engineer, working in Brighton, UK. He worked for many years for the Brighton and Hove General Gas Company. He was born in Bradford and died in Brighton.

== Patents ==
*UK Patent 7129 June 1836 &quot;Generating and Purifying Gas&quot;
*UK Patent 7615 April 1838 &quot;Obtaining Motive Power&quot;
*UK Patent 7727 July 1838 &quot;Manufacture of Iron&quot;

His patent of 1836 is recorded in the Mechanics Magazine as &quot;Certain improvements for generating and purifying gas for the purposes of illumination&quot;. He also contributed the lead article for the Mechanics Magazine on 23 September 1839, titled &quot;Barnett&#x27;s improved method of working gas retorts&quot;, which again relates to production of coal gas.

The patent &quot;Obtaining Motive Power&quot; relates to some very early work on the gas internal combustion engine, which is described in more details below.

== Contribution to early gas engines ==
William Barnett was an engineer involved in the early development of internal combustion engines, and his work and patent are described over several pages in Dugald Clerk&#x27;s book on Gas and Oil Engines. In Barnett&#x27;s UK patent (No 7615 of 1838), which was entitled &quot;Production of motive-power&quot;, Clerk states that &quot;Barnett&#x27;s inventions as described in his specification are so important that they require more complete description than has been accorded to earlier inventors&quot;, and he then proceeds to discuss Barnett&#x27;s patent over several pages.

The patent describes three types of internal combustion engine run using gas as a fuel. These use two key inventions that were important to the early commercial gas engines (which do not appear until over 20 years later).

* One of the engines described in the patent uses compression of the fuel/air mixture in the power cylinder, the system which Clerk describes as &quot;now so largely used in gas engines. The Frencheman, Lebon, it is true, described an engine using compression, in the year 1801, but his cycle is not in any way similar to that proposed by Barnett, or used in modern gas engines&quot;.
* The patent also describes a method for igniting the gas/air mixture within the cylinder using a flame transferred into the cylinder via an &#x27;igniting cock&#x27;. This was a mechanism extensively used in many of the early commercial gas engines in the latter part of the 19th century.

The engines themselves are of considerable interest as precursors, not of the first commercial gas engines (e.g. Lenoir engine in 1860, which used the two-stroke cycle without compression, or the Otto and Langen atmospheric engines), but rather of the later generation of engines including Otto&#x27;s engines operating on the four-stroke cycle and Dugald Clerk&#x27;s engine operating on the two-stroke cycle, both with compression of the gas/air mixture in the cylinder.

== Characteristics of the engines ==

Note that all three engines operate on the two-stroke cycle, as did most early engines (the competition was steam engines, which also operate on the two-stroke cycle, and are usually double acting so every stroke is a power stroke). It was a remarkable leap to discover that, for internal combustion engines, the four-stroke cycle with three non-power strokes could deliver both economy and performance, see Alphonse Beau de Rochas who patented the idea in 1861, and Otto who made commercial engines using the four-stroke cycle after his earlier work with atmospheric engines. All three of Barnett&#x27;s engines were vertical engines with a layout similar to steam table engines.

* The first engine is single acting using the two-stroke cycle, with separate pumps for gas and air, and a power cylinder. This cylinder is connected directly to a receiver vessel in which the combustion is initiated, the expansion flows into the power cylinder driving the piston. Timing of inlet and exhaust is via a piston valve, and an exhausting pump may be added to remove exhaust gases from the receiver prior to the new charge being forced in by the pumps. This is described as optional for smaller engines, as the exhaust gases are not so much a problem for them.
* The second engine is a double acting version of the first, i.e. combustion is alternately one side and then the other side of the piston. The operating principles are otherwise the same.
* The third engine is also double acting using the two-stroke cycle, and although it has the gas and air pumps of the others, it has an exhaust port uncovered by the piston towards the end of the power stroke, allowing the exhaust gases to exit and the fresh charge to enter the power cylinder and then be compressed by the piston prior to ignition at the end of the compression stroke.

The displayed image of the third engine reveals a double acting engine in the style of a steam table engine. The vertical cylinder is not water cooled. There is a central exhaust port on the cylinder wall uncovered by the piston. Separate gas and air pumps operates at twice engine speed to deliver the fresh charge to either end of the cylinder and purge the cylinder of exhaust gases, but the piston compresses the charge once the exhaust port is covered.

Dugald Clerk describes several patents on the internal combustion engine between 1839 and 1854, but states that &quot;Of these patents, by far the most important is Barnett&#x27;s&quot;. Praise indeed from an eminent engineer who would subsequently receive a KBE and become a fellow of the Royal Society.

The concept of a two-stroke double acting gas engine was later taken up by Körting who launched a 350bhp engine based on this principle in 1900. It was in production for many years. Heat management required a water cooled cylinder and piston. The air pump system was arranged so that air was admitted before gas/air mixture thus improving scavenging, and a longer piston meant less of the stroke was available for the scavenging to take place. Mechanical valve operation was used on the inlet valve and on control valves for the air and gas pumps. Further details can be found in the literature.

<text>John Shepard Reed (born February 7, 1939) is the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Citicorp, Citibank, and post-merger, Citigroup. He is the past chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s board of trustees.

==Biography==
He was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Calvin Francis Reed and Virginia (Shepard) Reed. He was raised in Argentina and Brazil. Reed earned his undergraduate degrees in a 3-2 program from Washington and Jefferson College (W&amp;J) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning a B.S. from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1961. He was also a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity while at W&amp;J and MIT. He served two years in the U.S. Army before returning to get his master&#x27;s degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1965.

Reed was heavily responsible for pushing for the adoption of the ATM around the US, and led Citicorp through a perilous period in the early 1990s. He was approached by Sandy Weill to merge with Travelers Group a year before the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (repealing the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933), allowing banking, insurance and securities companies to merge. The result was Citigroup, where Reed was later ousted in a management shakeup with Weill. Reed&#x27;s departure was announced in a 28 February 2000 press release. In the aftermath of the November 2008 federal bailout of Citigroup, Reed was described as deeply skeptical of the &quot;Wall Street financial engineering&quot; that led to its collapse and &quot;committed to consumer banking and sound commercial underwriting&quot;.

Reed was asked to be interim CEO of the New York Stock Exchange after the Richard Grasso over-compensation scandal. He accepted the job for a $1 salary and set up new governance rules as the NYSE became a public corporation.

Reed was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Reed was the chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Corporation (board of trustees) from 2010 through 2014.

He was a longtime member of the board of directors of Altria Group (and predecessor Phillip Morris Companies) through his retirement in 2008.

He became member of the Board of Directors of CaixaBank in 2011. In February 2016, he was elected president of the board of Boston Athenaeum.

Reed has four children from his first marriage. In 1994, he married Cindy McCarthy, who was a flight attendant on Citicorp&#x27;s corporate aircraft.

==Strategic planning==
Reed&#x27;s expectation that his business managers be able to present their proposed business strategies in a few presentation slides without excessive use of data and documentation is referenced by business writers W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne in a &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; publication.

<doc id="977120" wikidata="Q457137" url="?curid=977120" title="Samuel Brown (engineer)">
<text>Samuel Brown (1799 – 16 September 1849) was an English engineer and inventor credited with developing one of the earliest examples of an internal combustion engine, during the early 19th century.

Brown, a cooper by training (he also patented improvements to machinery for manufacturing casks and other vessels), has been described as the &#x27;father of the gas engine&#x27;. While living at Eagle Lodge in the Brompton area of west London, from 1825 to 1835, he developed &#x27;the first gas engine that unquestionably did actual work and was a mechanical success&#x27;. He set up two engines for demonstration purposes in the grounds of the Lodge.

His obituary credited him with being the inventor of the gas vacuum engine and the screw propeller.

==Brown&#x27;s Gas Vacuum Engines==

In patents dated 4 December 1823 and 22 April 1826, Brown proposed to fill a closed chamber with a gas flame, and so expel the air; then he condensed the flame by injecting water, and operated an air engine by exhausting into the partial vacuum so obtained. The idea was evidently suggested by James Watt&#x27;s condensing steam engine, flame being employed instead of steam to obtain a vacuum.

Brown later designed an engine that used hydrogen as a fuel—an early example of an internal combustion engine. It was based on an old Newcomen engine, had a separate combustion and working cylinders, and was cooled by water contained within a casing or cylinder lining, circulated around the cylinders (water was constantly kept moving through the action of a pump and was recooled by contact with outside air). It had a capacity of 8,800 cc but was rated at only 4 hp. He tested the engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter&#x27;s Hill on 27 May 1826.

:&quot;In 1826, Mr. Samuel Brown applied his gas-vacuum engine ... to a carriage, and ascended Shooter&#x27;s hill to the satisfaction of numerous spectators. The great expense, however, which attended the working of a gas-vacuum engine, prevented its adoption.&quot;

In 1828 the vacuum engine propelled carriage was again exhibited, this time running along the Hammersmith Road with several gentlemen in or upon it and a speed of 7 miles per hour.

On 1 February 1827 Brown demonstrated the ability of a version of his gas vacuum engine to power a river boat on the Thames (this followed an unsuccessful trial in January 1827). It was installed in a 36 foot cutter of a type common on the Thames and drove two paddle wheels. Its speed was claimed at 7-8 mph (6 knots). The gas used was water gas, i.e. the mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide obtained by passing water over white hot coke. The benefit of using water gas generated from steam rather than the steam itself was said to be a factor of 30, plus the weight of the engine was said to be 600 pounds compared to 2 to 3 tons for an equivalent steam engine. This experiment had been funded by the Canal Gas Engine Company, who met the same day and after discussing the experiments in spite of acknowledging the success of the trial decided to wind up the company rather than raise further funds.

In 1832 Brown demonstrated three of his engines of different types and construction at his premises at Eagle Lodge, Old Brompton. All three engines were in operation and one was of the same type as had been operating successfully on the Croydon Canal raising water from a lower to a higher level since June 1830. The economics of the Croydon Canal engine were interesting as the gas it consumed was made by turning coal into coke. The value of the resulting coke and coal tar by-products of making the gas substantially exceeded the cost of the coal, ground rent, repairs etc, so the gas vacuum engine made a profit of over £100 a year before considering the useful work it was doing. Unfortunately the economics of the Croydon Canal were not so robust and it closed in 1836. The gas vacuum engine complete with gasometer in situ on Croydon Common was auctioned as a going concern in 1837. It was described as able to lift water a height of 11 feet at a rate of 2000 gallons per minute.

The reports of an 1834 court case reveal that Brown and Company had been contracted to build a large gas vacuum engine to pump the fens at Soham. This engine had been designed to pump 7805 gallons of water per minute, lifting water 14 feet at 14 strokes per minute. It fell short of specification and only delivered two thirds of its rated horsepower, with a lift of 10 feet 6 inches.

The gas vacuum engine was eventually to become a commercial success. In 1853–1854 Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented the Barsanti–Matteucci engine which was a different form of gas vacuum engine. Developed further by Otto &amp; Langen in Germany, it was put into worldwide production (outside Germany) by Crossley of Manchester between 1867 and 1877. Examples of this form of engine can be seen working at the Anson Engine Museum. This success arose from a demonstration of the engine at the World Fair in Paris in 1867, where it was shown to be far more efficient than the current production gas engine of Lenoir which was driven by the pressure resulting from burning the gas, rather than a vacuum. The success of the vacuum engine was however short lived after the creation of engines that compressed the gas/air mixture before igniting it.

<text>The Insider is an American syndicated newsmagazine television program that was distributed by CBS Television Distribution. The program premiered in first-run syndication on September 13, 2004 and ended on September 9, 2017, as a spin-off of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, which originated the concept as a segment that took viewers &quot;behind closed doors&quot; and gave them &quot;inside&quot; information on stories and topics of interest from throughout the entertainment industry.

When it became a separate program, it shifted toward a tabloid direction, and had several format changes throughout its thirteen seasons on the air before settling on a final format at the start of the 2011–12 season, which shed many of the tabloid elements and became more of a straight rundown of entertainment news, providing coverage of events and celebrities, interviews and inside looks at upcoming film and television projects.

The program&#x27;s weekday broadcasts were anchored by Louis Aguirre and Debbie Matenopoulos; its weekend editions were anchored by Michael Yo and Keltie Knight, who also served as correspondents for the weekday editions.

==History==
Starting out with a bi-coastal format, the program was originally hosted by Pat O&#x27;Brien – who was based in Hollywood at Paramount Studios Stage 28, where &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;″s set was also housed at the time – and Lara Spencer – who was based at MTV&#x27;s One Astor Plaza studio in New York City, overlooking Times Square. In its first season, &quot;The Insider&quot; originally maintained a news-heavy format, making way for a direction where subjects such as a pair of anorexic nervosa twin sisters from Australia (who died in an April 2012 house fire) were regularly featured in sweeps periods, along with other fringe stories such as true crime stories and the Nadya Suleman story, which had little or nothing to do with the entertainment industry.

O&#x27;Brien – who was originally co-host of syndication competitor &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; from 1997 to 2004 – remained co-host of &quot;The Insider&quot; until March 5, 2008, when he was replaced with Donny Osmond. O&#x27;Brien returned to the program one month later after Osmond declined to take on a role as a permanent host. During the first four years she was on the program, Spencer hosted the program solo at times due to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s varied personal problems, which forced him to take time off in extended periods to address them. The original theme song – which was changed after the second season, coincided with a change in distributors to CBS Paramount Domestic Television after CBS assumed ownership of Viacom&#x27;s television production and syndication operations in their December 2005 split – was performed by Richie Sambora.

For its fourth season, production of the program was moved to New York City full-time in September 2007. O&#x27;Brien relocated from Los Angeles to join Spencer in a new studio based within the Minskoff Theatre in Manhattan (where the musical adaptation of &quot;The Lion King&quot; is based), which featured unobstructed views of Times Square, nearby the MTV studio facilities and also within One Astor Plaza.

On September 8, 2008, &quot;The Insider&quot; began broadcasting in high-definition television; concurrently, &quot;The Insider&quot; relocated primary production and studio operations back to Los Angeles, joining sister program &quot;ET&quot; at Stage 4 at the CBS Studio Center, one of the final steps involving the incorporation of Paramount&#x27;s former syndication arm, Paramount Domestic Television, into CBS&#x27; distribution arms following the earlier CBS-Viacom split and the adoption of the then-new CBS Television Distribution name. The set&#x27;s focal point was a large life-size 3D construction of the program&#x27;s logo, which was formerly used as the main portion of the set where segments took place until the September 2009 retooling of the program to incorporate a panel format.

The New York-based aspect of the program was also abandoned, with Spencer relocating to Los Angeles and becoming a solo host, joined by correspondents Victoria Recano, Steven Cojocaru and Cheryl Woodcock. In the move, O&#x27;Brien became a Los Angeles-based correspondent for the program; however ten days later on September 18, he was dismissed permanently from &quot;The Insider&quot; for comments he made in a staff email after a trip to Iowa, where he directed comments specifically at a mid-show daily segment presented by Spencer that debuted at the start of the season. O&#x27;Brien proceeded to involve a rundown of the prices and labels of her clothing and accessories (which were referenced in the segment), saying that it made the viewers he talked to &quot;vomit&quot;. Despite this pointed criticism, the segment continued to air at the end of every edition until Spencer&#x27;s departure, expanding to the point where viewers made a multiple choice on what Spencer would wear on the next broadcast. O&#x27;Brien would appear one more time on the final episode of &quot;The Insider&quot; nine years later, congratulating the show&#x27;s staff and crew for their work.

After the departure of O&#x27;Brien, the show was hosted by Spencer alone until January 2009, when Samantha Harris (who had previously served as a correspondent for &quot;E! News&quot;) joined the program as a permanent co-host. Harris also provided analysis and commentary as part of her duties as co-host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; until her departure from the reality competition series at the start of 2010.

===Changes in format and hosts===
During September 2009, the program converted to a panel format, featuring a roundtable discussion and debate format (similar to &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; or the &quot;Hot Topics&quot; segment of &quot;The View&quot;) with three permanent co-hosts and a guest host discussing entertainment topics, although that was also modified as actress Niecy Nash became a fourth &quot;de facto&quot; host and the program added a rotating fifth guest host slot. As a result, the on-air correspondents were effectively dismissed, with stories being compiled by &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; staff or off-camera personnel.

The format was changed once again in September 2010, restoring it to a more traditional entertainment newsmagazine concept with Spencer and Chris Jacobs as co-hosts. Industry analysts had surmised that the change was a precursor to testing Spencer in the traditional &quot;ET&quot; format without placing her on that show, as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;″s longtime primary anchor Mary Hart had announced her retirement from that program at the end of the 2010–2011 season; however, Nancy O&#x27;Dell would be appointed to succeed Hart as co-anchor at the end of May 2011.

On March 5, 2011, CBS Television Distribution announced that Kevin Frazier would become co-anchor of the program, replacing Jacobs, who moved to &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; as a correspondent for that program. Twelve days later on March 17, it was announced that Spencer would leave the program by the start of May to become the lifestyle anchor for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Spencer was replaced by Brooke Anderson, who had served as co-host of HLN&#x27;s &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;. During the week of the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, Anderson split her reporting duties between CNN and &quot;The Insider&quot;. At the start of its seventh season on September 4, 2011, the program was refocused more as a straight entertainment news show, with many of the tabloid elements of the Spencer/O&#x27;Brien era being removed; additionally, the program&#x27;s website was refocused to be more of a straight competitor to TMZ.

===Partnership with Yahoo!===
On October 24, 2012, CBS Television Distribution reached a brand licensing and content agreement with Yahoo! to pool content between the latter&#x27;s celebrity/gossip news division, omg!, and &quot;The Insider&quot;. Through this agreement, the program was retitled as omg! Insider on January 7, 2013. On January 1, 2014, executive producer Brad Bessey announced in a video on the program&#x27;s Facebook account that the show would restore its original title on January 6, while retaining all other elements. The reinstatement of the show&#x27;s original title resulted from Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer&#x27;s decision to rebrand of some of Yahoo&#x27;s platforms, including &quot;omg!&quot;, which changed its name to &quot;Yahoo Celebrity&quot;; however, both entities continue to share stories and content with one other. The Yahoo! partnership was discontinued on September 12, 2016.

In August 2014, Kevin Frazier departed &quot;The Insider&quot; to become co-anchor the weekday edition of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, on which he had previously served as a weekend anchor and correspondent from 2004 to 2011. He was replaced on September 8 of that year by Louis Aguirre, who joined the program after fifteen years as host of the similarly formatted &quot;Deco Drive&quot; on Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami.

On June 16, 2015, &quot;The Wrap&quot; reported that special correspondent Debbie Matenopoulos would replace Thea Andrews as co-host of &quot;The Insider&quot;; Matenopoulos replaced Andrews, who departed from the program, on July 6.

===Cancellation===
Because of declining ratings, CBS Television Distribution announced the cancellation of &quot;The Insider&quot; after 13 years on February 7, 2017. The final show aired on September 9.

==Syndication model==
&quot;The Insider&quot; aired on television stations in certain markets throughout the United States as half of a one-hour entertainment news block that also included the show from which it was spun off, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;.

Three versions of &quot;The Insider&quot; were previously compiled and made available to broadcasters before 2009; a &quot;standalone&quot; version (which largely omitted references to &quot;ET&quot;), and two other versions designed to precede or follow &quot;ET&quot; with promotions outlining stories to be featured on that day&#x27;s edition of the latter show, in addition to those stories to air on the next &quot;Insider&quot; broadcast. After 2009, only a standalone version without &quot;ET&quot; continuity was produced, as carriage of the program outside of primary markets was reduced to lower-tier stations and lower profile timeslots (often in late night television or on a same-day or day-behind basis in daytime television), making complementary coverage between the two shows impossible.
