<text>The szlachta (, ) was a privileged social class in the Kingdom of Poland. The term &quot;szlachta&quot; was also used for the Lithuanian nobility after the union of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with Poland as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Union of Lublin, 1569) and for the increasingly Polonized nobilities of territories controlled by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Ducal Prussia and the Ruthenian lands.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a semi-confederated, semi-federated monarchic republic from 1569 until 1795, comprising the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The head of state was an elected monarch. The Commonwealth&#x27;s dominant social class was the nobility. This article chiefly lists the nobility&#x27;s &quot;magnate&quot; segment (the wealthier nobility), as they were the most prominent, famous, and notable. These families would receive non-hereditary &#x27;central&#x27; and Land dignities and titles under the Commonwealth law that forbade (with minor exceptions) any hereditary legal distinctions within the peerage. They would later be &#x27;approximated&#x27; to honorary hereditary titles in the Partition period with little real-power privileges but would still be venerated among the Polish upper class and the rest of the society as &#x27;senatorial&#x27;, &#x27;palatinal&#x27;, &#x27;castellanial&#x27; or &quot;dignitarial&#x27; families.

&quot;&quot;Szlachta&quot; is the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century. Most powerful members of szlachta were known as magnates (&quot;magnaci&quot; or the &quot;magnateria&quot; class). A Polish nobleman who lived earlier is referred to as a &quot;rycerz&quot;&quot; (&quot;knight&quot;); the class of all such individuals is the &quot;rycerstwo&quot; (the &quot;chivalry&quot; class). Most powerful members of &quot;&quot;rycerstwo&quot; were known as &quot;możnowładcy&quot; (the &quot;moznowładztwo&quot;&quot; class).

<text>The 2004 ICC Champions Trophy was held in England in September 2004. Twelve teams competed in 15 matches spread over 16 days at three venues: Edgbaston, The Rose Bowl and The Oval.
The nations competing included the ten Test nations, Kenya (ODI status), and – making their One Day International debut – the United States who qualified by winning the 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge by the smallest of margins (coming down to net run rate over Canada, Namibia, and the Netherlands who had all recently played in the 2003 Cricket World Cup).

The ICC Champions Trophy was won by the West Indies in front of a sell-out Oval crowd. Ramnaresh Sarwan was named the Player of the Tournament.

<doc id="977139" wikidata="Q6587065" url="?curid=977139" title="Joist">
<text>A joist is a horizontal structural member used in framing to span an open space, often between beams that subsequently transfer loads to vertical members. When incorporated into a floor framing system, joists serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.

Joists are either made of wood, engineered wood, or steel, each of which has unique characteristics. Typically, wood joists have the cross section of a plank with the longer faces positioned vertically. However, engineered wood joists may have a cross section resembling the Roman capital letter &quot;&quot;; these joists are referred to as -joists. Steel joists can take on various shapes, resembling the Roman capital letters &quot;C&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;S&quot;.

Wood joists were also used in old-style timber framing. The invention of the circular saw for use in modern sawmills has made it possible to fabricate wood joists as dimensional lumber.

==Strength characteristics==

Joists must exhibit the strength to support the anticipated load over a long period of time. In many countries, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist needs to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a span is . Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.

Standard dimensional lumber joists have their limitations due to the limits of what farmed lumber can provide. Engineered wood products such as I-joists gain strength from expanding the overall depth of the joist, as well as by providing high-quality engineered wood for both the bottom and the top chords of the joist. A common saying regarding structural design is that &quot;deeper is cheaper&quot;, referring to the more cost-effective design of a given structure by using deeper but more expensive joists, because fewer joists are needed and longer spans are achieved, which more than makes up for the added cost of deeper joists.

==Types==

In traditional timber framing there may be a single set of joists which carry both a floor and ceiling called a single floor (single joist floor, single framed floor) or two sets of joists, one carrying the floor and another carrying the ceiling called a double floor (double framed floor). The term binding joist is sometimes used to describe beams at floor level running perpendicular to the ridge of a gable roof and joined to the intermediate posts. Joists which land on a binding joist are called bridging joists. A large beam in the ceiling of a room carrying joists is a summer beam. A ceiling joist may be installed flush with the bottom of the beam or sometimes below the beam. Joists left exposed and visible from below are called &quot;naked flooring&quot; or &quot;articulated&quot; (a modern U.S. term) and were typically planed smooth (wrought) and sometimes chamfered or beaded.

==Connections to supporting beams==
Joists may join to their supporting beams in many ways: joists resting on top of the supporting beams are said to be &quot;lodged&quot;; dropped in using a butt cog joint (a type of lap joint), half-dovetail butt cog, or a half-dovetail lap joint. Joists may also be tenoned in during the raising with a soffit tenon or a tusk tenon (possibly with a housing). Joists can also be joined by being slipped into mortises after the beams are in place such as a chase mortise (pulley mortise), L-mortise, or &quot;short joist&quot;. Also, in some Dutch-American work, ground level joists are placed on a foundation and then a sill placed on top of the joists such as what timber frame builder Jack Sobon called an &quot;inverted sill&quot; or with a &quot;plank sill&quot;.
Joists can have different joints on either ends such as being tenoned on one end and lodged on the other end.
A reduction in the under-side of cogged joist-ends may be square, sloped or curved. Typically joists do not tie the beams together, but sometimes they are pinned or designed to hold under tension. Joists on the ground floor were sometimes a pole (pole joist, half-round joist, log joist. A round timber with one flat surface) and in barns long joists were sometimes supported on a sleeper (a timber not joined to but supporting other beams). 
Joists left out of an area form an opening called a &quot;well&quot; as in a stairwell or chimney-well. The joists forming the well are the heading joist (header) and trimming joist (trimmer). Trimmers take the name of the feature such as hearth trimmer, stair trimmer, etc.

Shortened joists are said to be &quot;crippled&quot;. The term rim joist is rare before the 1940s in America; it forms the edge of a floor. The outermost joist in half timber construction may be of a more durable species than the interior joists. In a barn, loose poles above the drive floor are called a scaffold. Between the joists, the area called a joist-bay, and above the ceiling in some old houses is material called pugging, which was used to deaden sound, insulate, and resist the spread of fire.
In platform framing, the joists may be connected to the rim joist with toenailing or by using a joist hanger.

<text>Robert Michael Dickin (28 September 1943 – 18 December 2006), was an English radio presenter best known as the late-night host on the radio station talkSPORT.

==Early life==

Dickin was born in 1943 in Reading, Berkshire.

==Career==

Dickin started out as a musician in the 1960s: he was a bass player and singer who found he preferred playing records to making them when he joined the BBC in 1970 as the first presenter on air at Radio Oxford.

Dickin liked motor racing. He was a stunt driver in the 1969 film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.
In 1977, he competed in the London–Sydney Marathon in a Mini 1275GT, co-driven by musician Simon Park.
The same year, Dickin moved to Australia where he worked for Sydney&#x27;s biggest radio station, 2UE. Upon returning to Britain in the late 1970s, he spent 17 years working for BBC Radio 4, LBC, and Capital Radio. He started at Talksport (then Talk Radio UK) in 1995, taking over from Nick Miller.

Dickin used to present the 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. slot at weekends on Talk Radio from 1995 to 2001. He returned, filling in for James Whale during Whale&#x27;s battle with kidney cancer. He was given the morning show slot soon afterwards, and then moved to the 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. show on weekends before his death.

Dickin was on air in the UK overnight when news was broken of the car crash that subsequently killed Diana, Princess of Wales, and he was still on air to make the announcement of her death as a newsflash.

He won a Golden Rose award for his coverage of the Lockerbie disaster in 1988.

Although he had a reputation as an argumentative controversialist, his put-downs were withering and waspish enough without needing to raise his voice. During a phone-in on religion in late 2005, a caller mentioned Scientology, to which Dickin replied sardonically: &quot;Ah, yes. Tom Cruise and John Travolta – two of the great theologians of our age.&quot;

Dickin was famous for his strongly-held views. His passion led to him being labelled &quot;Britain&#x27;s angriest man&quot; by talkSPORT listeners. Typical discussions on his show included crime, cars, trains, taxis, the problems of young people, the downfall of Britain, the incompetence of people in the service industry, speed cameras, parking tickets, and call centres. He was also known for his catchphrases, such as, &quot;My health is not in question&quot;, when asked how he was. Other catchphrases include: &quot;If you were constipated, you&#x27;d be speechless&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a gutful...&quot;, &quot;You don&#x27;t have two brain cells to rub together&quot;.

Some of his shows were broadcast from a studio in Bodmin, Cornwall, a few miles from his home. A staunch atheist, Dickin&#x27;s last show was all about the afterlife and the existence of God; famous atheist and author of &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, Richard Dawkins, was Dickin&#x27;s guest on his last show.

Mike Dickin was killed in a car crash while driving on the A30 near his home in Cornwall, on 18 December 2006, at the age of 63. James Whale presented his tribute show. Dickin left a wife (second marriage) and 5 children, including two from his first marriage.

<text>The (; &quot;Defence Line of Amsterdam&quot;) is a fortification line around Amsterdam, which would function as a national redoubt. It comprises 45 forts, as well as dams, dikes, locks, pumping stations, batteries and casemates. The forts are from the centre and lowlands, which can easily be inundated in time of war. The inundation was designed to give a depth of about , too little for boats to cross. Any buildings within of the line had to be made of wood so that they could be burnt and the obstruction removed.

The was constructed between 1880 and 1920. The Stelling was mobilised and partially inundated during the first World War, but the Netherlands remained neutral and was not invaded. In 1922, the Stelling became part of the . The north side of the Stelling was inundated when Germany invaded in 1940 at the start of the second World War, but the Netherlands capitulated before the Germans reached the Stelling.

It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Dutch Water Defence Lines.

== Background ==

A combination of inundation and posts to protect Amsterdam date back as far as 1629, when these were prepared against a planned but later cancelled attack from the south by the Spanish general Ernesto Montecuccoli during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Another water defence line was prepared in the south in 1672, the &quot;Rampjaar&quot;, but the invaders failed to get past the Old Dutch Waterline. In June 1787, 27 posts were created by the Patriots and on 18 September 1787, the surrounding polders were inundated. These posts held back the Prussian invasion, but the Prussians managed to get access through the Haarlemmermeer and successfully attacked the posts from behind.

When the English invaded Holland in 1799, a water defence line was created north of Amsterdam, led by engineer Cornelis Krayenhoff. In 1800, the was created led by Krayenhoff to the west of Amsterdam, fearing another invasion by England. When the threat had decreased the next year, the posts were neglected. In 1805, Krayenhoff was tasked with creating a new defence line, because King Louis Bonaparte feared annexation by the First French Empire. The posts would be built in 1809 and 1810 at a distance of 8-12 km from the city, and would become known as the Posts of Krayenhoff. The Incorporation of the Netherlands in 1810 was peaceful, so the posts were not used. Plans were made to improve the posts, but they were never executed because of the liberation of the Netherlands in 1813. In the following decades, new forts would be added to the Posts of Krayenhoff in the poldered Haarlemmermeer: Fort near Heemstede, Fort along Schiphol, Fort along the Liede, Fort along the Nieuwe Meer.

==Function==
The was primarily a defensive water line (). In the event of an enemy attack, large tracts of land around Amsterdam would be inundated with water, preventing the enemy from advancing. Amsterdam would function as a national redoubt or reduit, as the last stronghold of the Netherlands. Forts were built in which roads, railways or dikes crossed through the water line. At such locations, there would be no water to stop the enemy and so the forts were intended to shell the enemy.

==Construction==
The law for the construction of the was passed in 1874, a few years after the Unification of Germany, which placed a powerful new great power on the eastern border of the Netherlands. During the planning prior to its construction, the design was already obviously outdated by modern technical advances. The invention of the high-explosive shell and the percussion fuze, which allowed ordnance to explode on impact and dislodge brick fortifications easily, necessitated a change from masonry to concrete forts. The Dutch did not have the required experience yet using and building with concrete and so extensive tests had to be performed. Concrete structures were shelled with the heaviest artillery available at that time. Further delays resulted from the fact that the sand foundations had to settle for several years before the forts could be built on them. Only in 1897 could the actual construction finally begin.

==Service==
The Stelling van Amsterdam has never seen combat service and the use of aircraft rendered it obsolete after World War I. It was, however, maintained and kept in service until it was decommissioned in 1963.

The dike through the Haarlemmermeer, which made it possible to inundate the southern portion of the polder while the northern portion could continue to produce food for Amsterdam, is now cut by the A4 motorway. The motorway also goes under the Ringvaart at Roelofarendsveen, which makes the inundation of the Haarlemmermeer Polder and thus the future use of the Stelling no longer possible.

In 1996, the complete Stelling was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was extended in 2021 with the New Dutch Waterline to form the Dutch Water Defence Lines.

<text>The Lichtenstein radar was among the earliest airborne radars available to the Luftwaffe in World War II and the first one used exclusively for air interception. Developed by Telefunken, it was available in at least four major revisions, called FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C, FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1, FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 and the very rarely used FuG 228 Lichtenstein SN-3. (FuG is short for &quot;Funk-Gerät&quot;, radio set). The Lichtenstein series remained the only widely deployed airborne interception radar used by the Germans on their night fighters during the war — the competing FuG 216 through 218 &quot;Neptun&quot; mid-VHF band radar systems were meant as a potentially more versatile stop-gap system through 1944, until the microwave-based FuG 240 &quot;Berlin&quot; could be mass-produced; the &quot;Berlin&quot; system was still being tested when the war ended.

Early FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C units were not deployed until 1942. They operated at a maximum RF output power of 1.5 kW, on the 61 cm wavelength (490 MHz, or low UHF band), requiring complex &quot;Matratze&quot; (mattress) antennas, consisting of thirty-two dipole elements, mounted in four groups of eight, each at the forward end of one of four forward-projecting masts.

== FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1 ==
During 1943 the &quot;Lichtenstein B/C&quot; was improved as the FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1, with longer range and wider angle of view, still operating at UHF Frequencies between 420 and 480 MHz and still using the complex &quot;Matratze&quot; aerial set. By this point in the war, the British had become experts on jamming German radars. Luftwaffe aircrew of a B/C-equipped Ju 88 R-1 night fighter, Werknummer 360 043, defected in May 1943 and landed at RAF Dyce in Scotland, presenting a working example of the German radar. The aircraft itself is still in existence as an RAF Museum exhibit in the UK. The subsequent refinement of &#x27;Window&#x27; (known as &quot;Düppel&quot; by the Luftwaffe, from the Berlin suburb near where the German version was developed) rendered &quot;Lichtenstein B/C&quot; almost useless for several crucial weeks.

== FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 ==
By late 1943, the Luftwaffe was starting to deploy the greatly improved FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, operating on a lower frequency of 90 MHz (lower end of the US VHF FM broadcast band) which was far less affected by electronic jamming, but this required the much larger &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; (stag&#x27;s antlers) antennas, with only eight dipole elements, looking like a much-enlarged version of what occupied the forward end of each one of the earlier quadruple &quot;Matratze&quot; masts. This aerial setup also produced tremendous drag and slowed the operating aircraft by up to 50 km/h (30 mph).

The first SN-2 set had a problem with a huge minimum range of 900 meters, initially requiring the retention of a supplementary B/C or C-1 set with its full set of four &quot;Matratze&quot; masts, but the alarming drag that full sets of both types of antennas caused, from both radars being installed, later changed the requirement to only a &quot;one-quarter&quot; subset of the earlier &quot;Matratze&quot; array at the end of a single mast, centrally mounted on the nose of the aircraft when the BC or C-1 UHF radar remained installed. Improvements in early 1944 led to newer SN-2 versions with lower minimum range, which allowed the older UHF radar system to be removed entirely.

In July 1944, the newest version of the SN-2 radar fell into Allied hands when a fully equipped Ju 88 G-1, of 7 &quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2, flew the wrong way on a landing beacon and landed at RAF Woodbridge in England by accident, with the crew not realising the mistake until it was too late to destroy the radar or IFF gear. This led to successful jamming of several frequency bands of the FuG 220 (I to III, 72, 81 and 90 MHz), and a partial adoption of the use of the low-to-mid VHF band 170 MHz FuG 216 and 217 Neptun radar — which used eight shorter-length dipoles in the same &quot;stag&#x27;s antlers&quot; layout for its frequency ranges than the SN-2 did — but several other bands that the SN-2 used were still operational. After the Allied jammings the FuG 220 antenna setup was optimized for the still-operational bands, the 90-degree vertical dipole setup was changed to a 45-degree diagonal setup.

== Late-war developments ==
Late in 1944, the &quot;Morgenstern&quot; (Morningstar) antenna, comprising a doubled set of two Yagi antenna arrays at 90° angles to each other, on a central, forward projecting mast was developed, and used by both the SN-2 and Neptun radar sets. This was just compact enough to fit into the nose of a Ju 88G, and was covered with a rubber-coated, wooden conical radome with the extreme tip of each element barely protruding above the surface. Further development led to the FuG 228 Lichtenstein SN-3 radar set but this saw little to no service. A 9 cm wavelength system known as FuG 240 Berlin was developed, based on captured examples of the Allies&#x27; cavity magnetron technology but saw little to no operational use.

== Operational history and Allied countermeasures ==
On the night of 8/9 August 1941, Ludwig Becker and his radio operator (&quot;Bordfunker&quot;) Josef Staub, became the first Luftwaffe night fighter crew to intercept an enemy bomber using airborne radar. Flying Dornier Do 215 B-5 of 4.&quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 1 &quot;G9+OM&quot; equipped with the FuG 202 &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; B/C radar, they tracked and claimed a Vickers Wellington bomber shot down. The aircraft shot down was Wellington &quot;T2625&quot; GR-B which crashed near Bunde.

The British knew in 1942 that Luftwaffe night fighters were having unprecedented success tracking aircraft. A specialist team was set up to attempt to identify the electronic characteristics of any German airborne apparatus. A Vickers Wellington bomber was adapted, with a Technical Officer and monitoring equipment in the fuselage. This aircraft flew on bombing raids as a decoy, hoping to be intercepted. In December 1942, on the 18th sortie, it was tracked and intercepted by a Luftwaffe night fighter, sustaining heavy damage and then ditching in the sea off Kent, England. The aircrew transmitted and brought back the electronic data, surviving the ditching. The electronics specialist, Pilot Officer Jordan, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, unusual for that rank of officer.

Following the capture in May 1943 of the Ju 88 R-1, &quot;Werknummer&quot; 360 043 that was equipped with it, the Allies were able to jam and track the early FuG 202 and 212 sets by the summer of 1943. During several months in this period they rendered these sets almost useless by blinding them with Window, termed &quot;Düppel&quot; by the Germans. Full jamming of the SN-2 took longer but was finally accomplished by the Allies following the mistaken landing due to a navigation error of a Ju 88G-1 night fighter from 7.&quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2 at RAF Woodbridge, equipped with both the Flensburg radar detector and the SN-2 radar on July 13, 1944, compromising both systems to the Allies. Some Allied aircraft were then equipped with &#x27;Piperack&#x27; which countered the Lichtenstein SN-2 aerial intercept radar. Much more dangerous were Mosquito intruders equipped with a device called Serrate to allow them to track German night fighters by emissions from their Lichtenstein B/C, C-1 or SN-2 sets.

The corkscrew manoeuvre was developed to remove an attacked heavy bomber from within the 60-degree cone of coverage of an attacking night fighter&#x27;s Lichtenstein radar. The technique was developed using the WkNr. 360 043, early model UHF-band Lichtenstein C-1-equipped, Ju 88R-1 night fighter, that had landed at RAF Dyce in April 1943 by its crew of defectors. It was also later flown in tests by the RAF enemy aircraft evaluation unit, 1426 Flight, known colloquially as the &quot;Rafwaffe&quot;.

<doc id="977153" wikidata="Q6138393" url="?curid=977153" title="USS Cavalla (SSN-684)">
<text>USS &quot;Cavalla&quot; (SSN-684), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the cavalla, a salt water fish. Although it was a Sturgeon class design, Cavalla was a modified &quot;long hull&quot; boat, approximately longer than the earlier ships in its class.

== Construction and commissioning ==
The contract to build &quot;Cavalla&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 24 July 1968 and her keel was laid down there on 4 June 1970. She was launched on 19 February 1972 sponsored by Mrs. Melvin Price, and commissioned on 9 February 1973, with Commander (later Admiral) Bruce DeMars in command.

== Service history ==

&quot;Cavalla&quot; operated as part of Submarine Squadron Ten from January 1974 to March 1975, then with Submarine Development Squadron 12 at Submarine Base New London (Groton, CT) until 1978.

In October 1978, &quot;Cavalla&quot; arrived as part of the Pacific Submarine force, and in November 1978 entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a refit lasting until March 1980, when she moved to her new home port at Submarine Base Pearl Harbor at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 1. Her operations from Pearl Harbor covered the globe, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic Oceans.

During her 1981 Westpac cruise ( January–June ) under Commander Fredric W. Rohm USN, &quot;Cavalla&quot; visited HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia, for R&amp;R from 15 to 22 April 1981.

In 1983, &quot;Cavalla&quot; became the first submarine to successfully perform dry deck shelter—a tank attached to the after deck back of the submarine allowing personnel to leave the submarine while submerged—operations in 1983.

During her Western Pacific deployment of 1985–1986, &quot;Cavalla&quot; supported critical dry deck shelter operations for SEAL team certification. She was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for these operations. In addition to this award, her crew members also earned various U.S. Navy ceremonial certificates during this same deployment: &quot;shellback&quot; status for crossing the equator, the Order of the Ditch on two occasions for transiting the Panama Canal, the Domain of the Golden Dragon on two occasions for crossing the International Date Line, and the Order of the Spanish Main for operating in the Caribbean Sea.

In 1995, &quot;Cavalla&quot; deployed to the Arctic Ocean for civilian scientific research.

In 1996, &quot;Cavalla&quot; participated in the very first joint American-Japanese deep submergence rescue vehicle operation.

== Decommissioning and disposal ==

&quot;Cavalla&quot; was decommissioned on 30 March 1998 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 17 November 2000.

<doc id="977154" wikidata="Q6138349" url="?curid=977154" title="USS Lapon (SSN-661)">
<text>USS &quot;Lapon&quot; (SSN-661), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the lapon, a scorpionfish of the Pacific coast of North America.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Lapon&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 24 October 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 26 July 1965. She was launched on 16 December 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Charles D. Griffin, wife of Admiral Charles D. Griffin (1906–1996), and commissioned on 14 December 1967.

==Service history==
Upon commissioning, Lapon reported to Commander, Submarine Force, United States Atlantic Fleet for duty, with her home port at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia. The Lapon&#x27;s crew successfully passed an Operational Readiness Review in early 1968 after completing training programs in SuBaseNLon. In the spring Lapon deployed on a SpecOp for which it received its first MUC. In late summer Lapon returned to NNS&amp;DD Co for post shakedown availability. In 1969, Lapon participated in a training exercise before CNO, CinCLant and ComSubLant to demonstrate the feasibility of trailing another submarine. Following that exercise Lapon deployed on a second SpecOp and received a second MUC. Later in 1969, while under the command of Commander Chester &quot;Whitey&quot; Mack, Lapon successfully tailed a Soviet Navy Yankee class ballistic missile submarine for a period of forty-seven days. Lapon followed the Yankee for the Yankee″s entire deterrent patrol and only broke contact when the Soviet submarine turned to go home. Lapon was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for the feat and Mack became famous in the submarine community for this noteworthy success, personally receiving the Distinguished Service Medal.

Lapon was on routine deployment in the Mediterranean Sea when the Yom Kippur War broke out on 6 October 1973. Lapon had been scheduled to make a three-day liberty run from La Maddalena, Sardinia to Athens, Greece, but was instead deployed to the eastern Mediterranean were it monitored Soviet submarine activity, remaining at sea for 44 days. Returning to La Magdelena when food stores were so low the crew had begun eating different kinds of meals. Because of the hasty departure when the war broke out, there were only three movies aboard. Two were terrible, and shown only once. The third movie was the 1971 release &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; which was shown twice a day for the entire deployment. Lapon set a record for most Soviet submarines trailed during the period, and the crew was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Deactivated on 1 October 1991 while still in commission, &quot;Lapon&quot; was decommissioned on 8 August 1992 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program began on 1 March 2003 and was completed on 31 August 2004.

The sail was transported from Bremerton Washington to Springfield Missouri. Reassembly was in 2005 at Vietnam War Memorial Post 639 thanks to the work of Runner Base of USSVI. Most costs were donated by businesses and patriotic Americans. Five past commanders attended the dedication ceremony.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Lapon&quot;″s sail was preserved as a war memorial at American Legion Post 639 in Springfield, Missouri. It was dedicated on 3 July 2005.
USS Lapon Association is an active group with bi-annual reunions.

The song “Ballad of Whitey Mack” by Tommy Cox was written in honor of &quot;Lapon&quot; and her commanding officer, Chester Mack.

<text>USS &quot;Hammerhead&quot; (SSN-663), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark, a voracious fish found in warm seas, with a curious hammerlike head.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Hammerhead&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia, on 28 May 1964 and her keel was laid down there on 29 November 1965. She was launched on 14 April 1967, sponsored by Mrs. O. Clark Fisher, and commissioned on 28 June 1968.

==Service history==
In 1981, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

Tom Clancy, author of the 1984 novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, was given a brief ride into port aboard &quot;Hammerhead&quot; in the late 1980s prior to the filming of the 1990 film adaptation of the novel, also entitled &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. After spotting a mounted roll of toilet paper in &quot;Hammerhead&quot;″s sonar room used for wiping grease pencil markings off the screens in the rooms, he proclaimed his intention to write the contrasting image of the low-technology toilet paper mount among all of the complicated electronics and other equipment aboard &quot;Hammerhead&quot; into the film. True to his word, he did.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Hammerhead&quot;, under the command of Commander Forrest Novacek, was decommissioned on 5 April 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 22 November 1995.

<doc id="977156" wikidata="Q2091881" url="?curid=977156" title="USS Finback (SSN-670)">
<text>USS &quot;Finback&quot; (SSN-670), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine,
was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the finback, the common whale of the Atlantic coast of the United States.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Finback&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 9 March 1965 and her keel was laid down there on 26 June 1967. She was launched on 7 December 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Charles F. Baird, wife of the Under Secretary of the Navy, and commissioned on 4 February 1970.

==Service history==
===Topless dancer incident===
On 10 July 1975, &quot;Finback&quot;″s commanding officer, (a commander with the courtesy title of &quot;captain&quot;), permitted a topless dancer to perform on the diving plane of the sail as the vessel departed Port Canaveral, Florida. The captain had given permission for the act as a reward for performance by his crew during a major overhaul at the Naval shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, the preceding year which cut two months off of a scheduled 12-month overhaul at considerable savings to the government. On 1 August 1975, when Navy command learned of the incident, the submarine was ordered back to port and the captain was relieved of his command, &quot;pending the investigation of an incident of a non-operational nature.&quot;

On 2 October 1975, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III found the captain of &quot;Finback&quot; &quot;guilty of permitting an action, which could have distracted the attention of those responsible for the safe navigation of the nuclear-powered submarine maneuvering in restricted waters.&quot; Holloway agreed with subordinates that the captain had failed to exercise good judgement and did not follow the regulations governing civilian visitors to naval vessels. An article in the February 2010 issue of &quot;Naval History&quot;, published by the United States Naval Institute, Annapolis, Maryland, categorizes this episode as &quot;one of the most notorious incidents in the history of the Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarine force.&quot;

===Refueling Overhaul===
In June 1978, the Finback entered Newport News shipyard for a scheduled refueling overhaul. The overhaul was completed in January 1981 and the Finback sailed to the Bahamas for testing and made port calls in Port Canaveral, Frederiksted, St Croix and St Maarten.

==Awards==
In 1986, &quot;Finback&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the United States Atlantic Fleet.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Finback&quot; was decommissioned on 28 March 1997 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 30 October 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Billfish&quot; (SSN-676), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the billfish, a name used for any fish, such as gar or spearfish, with bill-shaped jaws.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Billfish&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 15 July 1966 and her keel was laid down on 20 September 1968. She was launched on 1 May 1970, sponsored by Mrs. Earle G. Wheeler, the wife of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle G. Wheeler (1908–1975), and commissioned on 12 March 1971.

==Service history==

Upon her commission, she was assigned to Submarine Development Group Two, based in Groton, Connecticut. She was deployed to the Mediterranean, participating in fleet exercises and tactical and sonar development tests. She was awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award for her performance in the Development Group.

In 1973, &quot;Billfish&quot; trailed the Soviet submarine K-279 in the Barents Sea, correctly identifying a new Soviet submarine radar present on K-279. In 1974, she witnessed a launch of the then newly-developed Soviet R-29 submarine-launched ballistic missile. For these actions, along with participation in several fleet exercises, she was awarded the Meritorous Unit Commendation 1in 1974.

&quot;Billfish&quot; participated in the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review.

&quot;Billfish&quot; was one of the few submarines fitted to carry the Mystic class deep submergence rescue vehicle during the 1980s.

&quot;Billfish&quot; spent the rest of her service career on regular deployments. Her last patrol, in the Arctic Ocean, ended in November 1997.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Billfish&quot; was decommissioned on 1 July 1999 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping was via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 26 April 2000.

<doc id="977159" wikidata="Q5968178" url="?curid=977159" title="USS Batfish (SSN-681)">
<text>USS &quot;Batfish&quot; (SSN-681), was a nuclear-powered attack submarine of the United States Navy. She was the eleventh launched. Her primary missions were anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, and screening carrier battle groups. She was launched in 1971 and decommissioned in 1999.

==Construction and characteristics==

The contract to build &quot;Batfish&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation on 25 June 1968. Her keel was laid down in its Groton, Connecticut shipyard on 9 February 1970. The boat was launched on 9 October 1971, sponsored by Mrs. Mildred C. Gralla, wife of Vice Admiral Arthur R. Gralla, commander of the Military Sealift Command. The featured speaker at the ceremony was Senator Lowell P. Weicker. The submarine completed her initial sea trials successfully in June 1972 under the supervision of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. She was commissioned at a ceremony in Groton on 1 September 1972 where Rear Admiral Walter L. Small was the featured speaker.

&quot;Batfish&quot; was originally budgeted at $67 million in the Navy&#x27;s fiscal year 1967 budget. By 1970 he estimated cost had risen to $76.5 million, both because her various subcontractors had learned just how complex these submarines were, and because of design modifications required by the Navy.

The ship was long; she was a long-hull variant of the &quot;Sturgeon&quot; class which provided an extra of hull space over the earlier vessels in her class. &quot;Batfish&quot; had a beam of , and a draft of when surfaced. She displaced 3,640 long tons when surfaced and 4,650 long tons when submerged.

Her hull and sail were made from welded steel plates. Her bow was reserved for her spherical sonar array, and thus her torpedo tubes were mounted amidships.

She had a single propeller that was driven by two steam turbines. Steam for the turbines was produced by a Westinghouse S5W nuclear reactor. Her maximum speed was approximately 20 knots surfaced and 30 knots submerged.

Her main armament was four 21-inch torpedo tubes which accommodated Mark 48 torpedoes, SUBROC and Harpoon missiles, and various mines.

&quot;Batfish&quot; had BQQ-5 sonar system which included a bow-mounted spherical-array. It also had a retractable 1,100-foot towed array, likely a TB-16. She had two periscopes for visual search, one smaller than the other to minimize the possibility of detection.

The submarine was an early user of a number of advanced technologies. In 1976, &quot;Batfish&quot; was the first submarine to make operational use of Extremely-Low-Frequency radio communications. In 1980, she was the first U.S. submarine to receive Special Hull Treatment, a coating of rubberized anechoic tiles which were glued to her hull to dampen noise emissions. An electrostatically supported gyro navigator (ESGN) inertial navigation system allowed &quot;Batfish&quot; to determine her location even when navigating submerged for extended periods.

She was manned by 12 officers and 95 enlisted men at the time of her launch, but her complement varied over time and was as large as 12 officers and 110 men.

&quot;Batfish&quot; was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the batfish. The first &quot;Batfish&quot; was a successful World War II submarine.

==Service history==
After commissioning, &quot;Batfish&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 4, which at the time was based at Naval Station Charleston at Charleston, South Carolina. She arrived there on 7 October 1972 after stops at Norfolk and the U.S. Naval Academy.

From her arrival in Charleston through the late Spring of 1974, Batfish went through multiple cycles of training, evaluation, maintenance, and modification to ready her for deployment. During this period, at about 1 pm on 22 January 1973, &quot;Batfish&quot; ran hard aground at the entrance to Charleston Harbor while proceeding to sea. She was pulled free by five tugs at about 7 pm that same day. Fog was reported as a possible cause of the grounding. She returned to port where damage to her bottom was repaired.

The boat was sent on her first operational deployment in 1974. Much of &quot;Batfish&#x27;s&quot; service history was classified at the time, but it clearly involved shadowing Soviet ballistic missile submarines, and intelligence gathering near the Soviet&#x27;s Arctic coast. Contemporary reporting on her activities was sparse. Nonetheless, the following activities can be documented:
The 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the consolidation of Atlantic Fleet nuclear submarines into one base. This recommendation ultimately resulted, in September 1994, in &quot;Batfish&quot; changing her homeport from Charleston to Groton, where she was based at Naval Submarine Base New London. This remained her home port for the rest of her operational life.

=== Operation Evening Star, 1978 ===
On 2 March 1978, &quot;Batfish&quot; left Charleston captained by Commander (later Rear Admiral) Thomas Evans. Like most of the boat&#x27;s deployments, details of &quot;Operation Evening Star&quot; were classified. Some of the details of this remarkable patrol were declassified in June 1999, and a press conference highlighting the mission was held on 1 March 2001 as part of a program to honor the centennial of the U.S. submarine force.

&quot;Batfish&quot; was dispatched from Charleston because U.S. spy satellites and CIA-sponsored Norwegian intelligence activities suggested that a Soviet Navy Yankee I-class ballistic missile submarine was about to leave her base on the Kola Peninsula. On 17 March 1978, &quot;Batfish&quot; detected this submarine in the Norwegian Sea some above the Arctic Circle. &quot;Batfish&quot; began trailing the boat, collecting valuable information on how Soviet submarines operated. On 19 March, after 350 miles and 51 hours of trailing her target, &quot;Batfish&quot; lost contact during a storm. A P-3 Orion patrol plane sent from Reykjavik refound the Soviet sub, and &quot;Batfish&quot; was able to once again slip in behind her on 21 March. &quot;Batfish&quot; remained in contact with the missile submarine for the next 44 days over 8,870 nautical miles, only breaking off in the Norwegian Sea as the Soviet ship returned to base.

On 17 May 1978, after 77 days submerged, &quot;Batfish&quot; surfaced off Charleston to return to her home port. Commander Evans was awarded the Legion of Merit for this mission.

The Soviets remained unaware that their submarines were being followed until U.S. Navy Chief Warrant Officer John Anthony Walker reported the incident to them while he was spying in the 1980s. Walker pleaded guilty to espionage in 1985. Ironically, the leak of &quot;Batfish&#x27;s&quot; success in tracking the Soviet missile submarine may have contributed to the end of the Cold War. The realization that its submarine-launched missiles were vulnerable, and were not a reliable second-strike force is thought by some to have influenced Soviet unwillingness to compete with the United States. In 1985, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman declared that U.S. submarines would attack Soviet missile submarines &quot;in the first five minutes of the war&quot;, a statement given credibility by &quot;Batfish&#x27;s&quot; success in Operation Evening Star.

=== Major maintenance ===
The boat underwent continual maintenance to keep her running, and she had short periods of upkeep and restricted availability throughout her service life. During her 27 years of commissioned service, she spent over three years undergoing two major overhauls.

&quot;Batfish&quot; underwent a 15-month overhaul at Portsmouth, Virginia beginning in March 1979. This work was estimated at $36.7 million.

The submarine began an extensive overhaul in January 1988 at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. She did not leave the yard for sea trials until December 5, 1990. Vice Admiral Roger F. Bacon, Commander of the Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, publicly criticized the shipyard&#x27;s work as 14 months late and $6 million over budget. The overhaul cost $127.5 million.

==Final disposition==
&quot;Batfish&quot; changed to &quot;in commission, in reserve&quot; status, pending scrapping, on 2 November 1998. She was decommissioned on 17 March 1999 at the Pearl Harbor Submarine Base and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 22 November 2002.

== Awards ==
&quot;Batfish&quot; and her crew earned a variety of honors and awards during her service including:

* The Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal in May–June 1998
* The Armed Forces Service Medal in 1992 and 1995
* Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1975 and 1996
* Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon in 1976 and 1991
* Navy Unit Commendation in 1977, 1978, 1982, 1995, and 1998

<text>USS &quot;Drum&quot; (SSN-677), a attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the drum, also known as the croaker or hardhead, any of various fishes of the &quot;Sciaenidae&quot; family, capable of making a drumming noise and best known on the Atlantic coast of North America.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Drum&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 15 March 1967, and her keel was laid down there on 20 August 1968. She was launched on 23 May 1970, sponsored by Mrs. William F. Bringle, wife of Vice Admiral William F. Bringle, commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, and commissioned on 15 April 1972. &quot;Drum&quot; was the last US naval vessel newly built in a naval shipyard.

==Service history==
===1970s===
After commissioning, &quot;Drum&quot; conducted initial testing in Puget Sound before arriving at her home port of San Diego, California, on 22 May 1972. &quot;Drum&quot; then commenced six months of operational tests and fleet training exercises in Puget Sound, the Hawaiian Islands, and off San Diego to become a unit of the United States Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. After completing these tests and exercises, &quot;Drum&quot; returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in November 1972 for a one month of post-shakedown testing.

After completing the post-shakedown testing and follow-on operations in Southern California, &quot;Drum&quot; deployed in March 1973 on her first Western Pacific deployment; it also was the longest deployment of her career, lasting eight months before she returned to San Diego in November 1973.

&quot;Drum&quot; began her second deployment to the Western Pacific at the end of 1974, visiting Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines before returning to San Diego in May 1975. &quot;Drum&quot; was awarded her first Navy Unit Commendation for her successes during this deployment.

In June 1976, &quot;Drum&quot; departed San Diego for her third Western Pacific deployment, visiting Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and Guam, and returned to San Diego in November 1976. She was awarded her first Meritorious Unit Commendation for her successes during this deployment.

1977 began with &quot;Drum&quot; changing her home port to Bremerton, Washington, and entering Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for Mark 48 torpedo impact testing and a non-refueling . She completed the overhaul in April 1978, ahead of schedule and under budget. She spent the next several months conducting operations in Puget Sound, including visits to Seattle and Everett in Washington and Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, until returning to San Diego, which once again became her home port, in July 1978.

From her return to San Diego until April 1979, &quot;Drum&quot; completed the rigorous training, testing, and loadout necessary prior to a deployment. She then deployed to the Western Pacific again from May to October 1979. During this deployment, she completed a special operation for which she was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation and made port visits to Guam, Thailand, and the Philippines. After returning to San Diego in October 1979, she engaged in local operations and completed two months of repairs and alterations at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

===1980s===
In May 1980, after &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego, and for the next several months, &quot;Drum&quot; operated in the San Diego area. She began her next Western Pacific deployment in October 1980, which included visits to Guam and the Philippines. This deployment lasted until mid-April 1981, when she returned to San Diego.
In the course of that year the collided with an unidentified American submarine, believed to be of the , in the Peter the Great Bay, not far from Vladivostok. At least one source identifies this submarine as USS &quot;Drum&quot;.

In November 1981, &quot;Drum&quot; again departed San Diego for the Western Pacific, visiting South Korea, spending Christmas in Japan, and returning home at the beginning of 1982. She then conducted operations off Southern California and visited San Francisco, California, before starting another period of repairs and alterations in San Diego in the summer of 1982.

Upon completion of repairs, &quot;Drum&quot; concluded 1982 preparing for her next deployment. Shortly after Christmas 1982, &quot;Drum&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific. During this deployment, &quot;Drum&quot; visited the Philippines, Australia, and Japan, and also conducted operations in the Indian Ocean, during which she visited Diego Garcia. She returned to San Diego in June 1983.

After a routine standdown period at the end of this deployment, &quot;Drum&quot; participated in Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Mark 48 torpedo testing exercises at the tracking range at Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges, Nanoose Bay, British Columbia.

In May 1984, &quot;Drum&quot; left San Diego for a Western Pacific deployment, stopping in Hawaii for RIMPAC &#x27;84, a multi-national naval exercise, then continued west with visits to the Philippines, Japan, Guam, and Thailand. &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego in November 1984.

1985 began with local operations off Southern California and operations in Puget Sound, including a port visit to Esquimalt, British Columbia. In October 1985, &quot;Drum&quot; changed her home port to Bremerton, Washington, for the second time to begin her second and last overhaul – a refueling overhaul – at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

The refueling overhaul was completed in November 1987, and &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego. which again became her home port, and became a unit of her new squadron, Submarine Squadron 11.

&quot;Drum&quot; spent most of 1988 in local operations and preparation for her next deployment. Nine months after completion of her refueling overhaul, &quot;Drum&quot; left San Diego for two months of independent operations, for which she was awarded her third Meritorious Unit Commendation.

In mid-May 1989, &quot;Drum&quot; departed on her tenth deployment to the Western Pacific, for which &quot;Drum&quot; was awarded her second Navy Unit Commendation. The deployment included visits to Lahaina, Hawaii, Maui and Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and to Japan. &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego in August 1989 and continued operations in the Southern California area for the remainder of 1989.

===1990s===
1990 began with repairs and alterations that were completed in March. On 1 April 1990, &quot;Drum&quot; transferred from Submarine Squadron 11 to Submarine Squadron 3.

&quot;Drum&quot; participated in RIMPAC &#x27;90, which included a port call at Lahaina, Maui, in the spring of 1990. After a summer of preparations, &quot;Drum&quot; departed San Diego in September 1990 for another deployment to the Western Pacific, during which she made port calls at Guam, Japan, and Singapore. &quot;Drum&quot; was awarded her fourth Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during this deployment, and while deployed, was awarded the Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) for Submarine Squadron 3 for her outstanding performance during fiscal year 1990. &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego in March 1991.

In August 1991, &quot;Drum&quot; commenced independent operations. She returned to San Diego in late September 1991. In October 1991, she participated in San Francisco″s Fleet Week ″91.

&quot;Drum&quot; was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Submarine Squadron 3, for the second consecutive year for outstanding performance in Fiscal Year 1991.

In February 1992, &quot;Drum&quot; departed on another deployment to the Western Pacific. Port visits included Pearl Harbor, Japan, Guam, Singapore, and Australia, and she completed a transit of the inner passage of the Great Barrier Reef. During this deployment, she was awarded her the fifth Meritorious Unit Commendation. She returned to San Diego in August 1992, then hosted a tour by senior Russian naval officers and dignitaries.

&quot;Drum&quot; departed San Diego on her next Western Pacific deployment on 27 December 1993. During this deployment, she visited Guam, Japan, and New Caledonia.

In 1994, &quot;Drum&quot; participated in San Francisco″s Fleet Week ″94 and made a port visit to Astoria, Oregon.

On 13 February 1995, &quot;Drum&quot; departed San Diego for her thirteenth and last deployment to the Western Pacific, which included a visit to Guam. While leaving port in Hong Kong during the deployment, she collided with the Panamanian-registered cargo ship &quot;Sei Bright&quot;. &quot;Sei Bright&quot; suffered slight damage to her bow. No one was injured on either ship nor did &quot;Drum&quot; suffer notable damage. &quot;Drum&quot; returned to San Diego on 13 April 1995. Her Commanding Officer was relieved of duty pending investigation of the collision, later resolved as &quot;not for cause.&quot;

At 1300 hours on 20 May 1995, an inactivation ceremony was held for &quot;Drum&quot; at San Diego. In late May 1995, she departed San Diego for the last time, destined for Pearl Harbor, where she would undergo deactivation at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Drum&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1995. Afterwards, she was stored at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, awaiting entry into the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program for scrapping.

On 20 May 2010 the ex-&quot;Drum&quot; entered drydock for the last time. The ship was recycled in drydock three at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and IMF. In early 2011 her reactor compartment was shipped to Hanford, Washington, for burial. The sail of the USS &quot;Drum&quot; was removed for display. It is currently on display at U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command, Great Lakes, Illinois.

==Preservation efforts==
The non-profit Mare Island Park Historic Foundation was raising money to return &quot;Drum&quot; to Vallejo as a floating museum ship. In Fiscal Year 1997, the United States Congress authorized the transfer of &quot;Drum&quot; to Vallejo at &quot;no cost to the U.S. Government&quot;. If enough money had been raised to cover the cost of that transfer, &quot;Drum&quot; would have been transferred to Vallejo after removal of her nuclear reactor and decontamination of her hull. These efforts were unsuccessful.

<doc id="977164" wikidata="Q1362570" url="?curid=977164" title="Frank Marino">
<text>Francesco Antonio Marino (born November 20, 1954) is a Canadian guitarist and singer, best known as the leader of Canadian hard rock band Mahogany Rush. Often compared to Jimi Hendrix, he is described as one of the most underrated guitarists of the 1970s. In 2021, he announced his retirement from music.

==Biography and career==
After playing drums since he was five, Marino started playing guitar around age 13 or 14. An often-repeated myth is that he was visited by an apparition of Jimi Hendrix after a bad LSD trip - a myth Marino has always disavowed, and continues to do so on his personal website. His playing, however, is inspired by Hendrix (on the Gibson website he is described as &quot;carrying Jimi&#x27;s psychedelic torch&quot;), and Marino is notable for often performing cover versions of Hendrix classics such as &quot;Purple Haze&quot; and &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot;. He has been criticized by some as a Hendrix clone. Marino himself claims that he did not consciously set out to imitate Hendrix: &quot;The whole style just came naturally. I didn&#x27;t choose it; it chose me.&quot;

Mahogany Rush was moderately popular in the 1970s. Their records charted in &quot;Billboard&quot;, and they toured extensively, performing with well-known bands, including Aerosmith and Ted Nugent, and played at California Jam II in 1978. Toward the end of the 1970s, the band began to be billed as &quot;Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush.&quot; Not much later, Mahogany Rush split up and in the early 1980s Marino released two solo albums on CBS. The band reformed and continued to perform throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Marino opened his own audio recording studio, Starbase Studio, in the Notre-Dame-de-Grace district of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 

Marino reformed a band in 2000, &quot;I always knew we had fans, I just didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;d find half a million of them on the Web,&quot; he said in an interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; in 2005. He released &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, and went on tour again, playing more improvisational shows. After having not played live for a decade, Frank scheduled a tour for 2020 that was postponed due to the pandemic. He rescheduled the tour for 2021, before announcing his retirement on June 30, 2021, due to an undisclosed medical condition. He was also involved in blues recordings with other artists, playing on tribute albums to Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan.

==Technique and equipment==
Besides Jimi Hendrix, Marino acknowledged the influence of John Cipollina (of Quicksilver Messenger Service fame), Robby Krieger, Duane Allman, Johnny Winter, and Carlos Santana. His playing style is a combination of blues, heavy rock and, to an extent, jazz fusion techniques. One of his notable tricks is playing (live) a lick as if it were played backwards, with the help of only a volume pedal and a delay. His style has influenced many guitar players, including Zakk Wylde, Joe Bonamassa, Eric Gales, Vinnie Moore and Paul Gilbert. His tone is recognized by, for instance, &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, which called him a &quot;full-spectrum guitar god,&quot; alongside Jeff Beck, Eddie Van Halen, and The Edge.

Marino is a devoted Gibson SG player and uses them with the original PAF pickups, as well as two with DiMarzio humbuckers. He also has an SG with single-coil DiMarzio pickups. He is noted for complicated setups; according to &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, he has &quot;an entire pedalboard ... assigned to hold the expression pedals that control the parameters of the effects on &quot;another&quot; pedalboard.&quot; In the past, he has built his own amplifiers to achieve the right sound; he also uses Fender Twins. He currently uses a preamp which he built himself, reminiscent of a Fender, and any available power amp, through a 2&quot; x 15&quot; Fane cabinet.

==Personal life==
Of Italian and Syrian background, Marino is a practicing member of the Syriac Orthodox Church.

Marino is uncle to Danny Marino, lead guitarist of Canadian metal band The Agonist.

<doc id="977171" wikidata="Q290453" url="?curid=977171" title="Polder model">
<text>The polder model () is a method of consensus decision-making, based on the Dutch version of consensus-based economic and social policymaking in the 1980s and 1990s. It gets its name from the Dutch word (&quot;polder&quot;) for tracts of land enclosed by dikes.

The polder model has been described as &quot;a pragmatic recognition of pluriformity&quot; and &quot;cooperation despite differences&quot;. It is thought that the Dutch politician Ina Brouwer was the first to use the term &quot;poldermodel&quot;, in her 1990 article &quot;&quot; (&quot;Socialism as Polder Model?&quot;), although it is uncertain whether she coined the term or simply seems to have been the first to write it down.

==Socioeconomic polder model==

The Dutch polder model is characterised by the tripartist cooperation between employers&#x27; organisations such as VNO-NCW, labour unions such as the Federation Dutch Labour Movement, and the government. These talks are embodied in the Social-Economic Council (, SER). The SER serves as the central forum to discuss labour issues and has a long tradition of consensus, often defusing labour conflicts and avoiding strike actions. Similar models are in use in Finland, namely the Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement and universal validity of collective labour agreements.

The current Dutch polder model is said to have begun with the Wassenaar Agreement of 1982, when unions, employers, and government decided on a comprehensive plan to revitalise the economy involving shorter working times and less pay on the one hand, and more employment on the other, has increasingly steered in the direction of a neoliberal economic policy of privatisation and budget cuts.

An important role in this process was played by the Dutch Central Planning Bureau (CPB), founded by Jan Tinbergen. The CPB&#x27;s policy advice since 1976, in particular with the Den Hartog and Tjan model, in favour of wage restraint, was an important argument, supportive for government and employers, that the unions could not easily counter. Many authors and researchers have argued that the importance of the Wassenaar Agreement has been largely overrated. Most of these writers have argued that considerable continuity can be seen from the 1950s onwards. Historian Stijn Kuipers, goes even further. In an article reliant on the work of Coen Helderman, Kuipers argues that the modern socioeconomic polder model already manifested itself in 1920 with the Dutch High Council of Labour. It follows that the polder model is therefore much older and could have had a larger influence on Dutch society and economy than previously thought.

==Other uses==
The term polder model and especially the verb &quot;polderen&quot; (&quot;to polder&quot;) has been used pejoratively by some politicians to describe the slow decision-making process where all parties have to be heard. The model flourished under the purple coalition governments of Prime Minister Wim Kok, a coalition including the traditional rivals the Labour Party (a social-democratic party, whose colour is red) and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (conservative liberals, whose colour is blue). In the declining economic climate of the early 21st century, the model came under fierce attack particularly from right-wing politicians and Pim Fortuyn in his book entitled &quot;De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars&quot; (&quot;The Wreckage of Eight Years Purple&quot;).

==Historical background==
There is no consensus about the exact historical background of the polder model. In general, there are three views on this subject. One explanation points to the rebuilding of the Netherlands after World War II. Corporatism was an important feature of Christian democracy and particularly Catholic political thought. During the postwar period, the Catholic, Protestant, Christian, social-democratic, and liberal parties decided to work together to reconstruct the Netherlands, as did labour unions and employers&#x27; organizations. Important institutions of the polder model like the SER were founded in this period. No single political party has ever had anything approaching an overall majority in parliament, so a coalition government is inevitable. This makes parties extremely cautious, since today&#x27;s enemy may be tomorrow&#x27;s ally, all the more so in present times when the perceived death of ideology has made it possible for almost all the parties to work together.

Another explanation points to the dependency of the Netherlands on international trade and the world economy. The Dutch cannot afford protectionism against the unpredictable tides of the international economy because the Netherlands is not an autarkic economy. To cushion against the international economy, they set up the Social-Economic Council, which oversaw an extensive welfare state. A third explanation refers to a unique aspect of the Netherlands, that it consists in large part of polders, land reclaimed from the sea, which requires constant pumping and maintenance of the dykes. Ever since the Middle Ages, when the process of land reclamation began, different societies living in the same polder have been forced to cooperate because without unanimous agreement on shared responsibility for maintenance of the dykes and pumping stations, the polders would have flooded and everyone would have suffered. Crucially, even when different cities in the same polder were at war, they still had to cooperate in this respect. This is thought to have taught the Dutch to set aside differences for a greater purpose.

<text>The Bytham River is said to have been one of the great Pleistocene rivers of central and eastern England until it was destroyed by the advancing ice sheets of the Anglian Glaciation around 450,000 years ago. The river is named after Castle Bytham in Lincolnshire, where the watercourse is said to have crossed the Lincolnshire limestone hills in a valley now buried by Anglian till. West of that location, its catchment area included much of Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire. East of that location, the Bytham flowed across what is now the Fen Basin to Shouldham, then southward to Mildenhall, then eastward across East Anglia. It met the Proto-Thames in a delta near what is now the Norfolk/Suffolk border and flowed into the North Sea. Britain was then joined to the Continent by a land bridge and the Bytham joined the North Sea somewhere beyond the northern end of that land bridge.

Chris Stringer writes: &quot;As the Bytham River slowed past Warren Hill [in Norfolk] towards its delta on what is now the East Anglian coast, it deposited sediments on the edge of the huge north-facing bay, into which the Rhine also flowed. The sites of Norton Subcourse in Norfolk and nearby Pakefield, just over the border in Suffolk, were probably both related to the Bytham, and they record a time when the climate of Britain was balmy and Mediterranean, and this part of East Anglia was a fertile estuarine plain.&quot;

The Anglian ice advance which followed, with its ice front reaching at least as far south as London and Birmingham, overrode all or most of the Bytham&#x27;s catchment area. The course of the river was severed in the region of the Fen Basin. Following the ice retreat, the Bytham&#x27;s remaining western section became part of the Trent catchment, and its remaining eastern section became a precursor of the Waveney river, running across East Anglia.

In the mid-2010s the existence of the Bytham was disputed. It was argued that an eastern section of the supposed river, flowing across central East Anglia, was indeed part of a pre-Anglian watercourse, but one which came from the north-west, through the Ancaster Gap in Lincolnshire. That &quot;proto-Trent&quot; river was severely disrupted by the Anglian glaciation. It has further been suggested that a western section of the supposed &quot;Bytham river&quot; was part of a &quot;post&quot;-Anglian watercourse which flowed SW-NE from Warwickshire to the North Sea via The Wash. That &quot;proto-Soar&quot; river was also modified by glaciation, but in that case by the later Wolstonian ice advance. Those western and eastern sections never linked up to form a &quot;Bytham river&quot;.

A later study asserted that the refutation of the existence of the Bytham is itself &quot;contradicted by an abundance of evidence&quot;, and that sand and gravel deposits of the proto-Soar in Leicestershire could &quot;only have been emplaced by a river flowing eastward across East Anglia&quot; (ie, according to this study, by a large, &quot;pre&quot;-Anglian river, the Bytham).

However, a detailed 2022 study of post-Anglian deposits in the Midlands estimates the age of the proto-Soar deposits (&quot;Baginton sands&quot;) as around 150 ka - ie, as &quot;post&quot;-Anglian, not pre-Anglian. This reinforces the refutation hypothesis.

<text>Shimshal (), previously known as Shingshal, is a village located in the Gojal tehsil of the Hunza District in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of northern Pakistan. It lies at an altitude of above sea level and is the highest settlement in the district. It is the largest valley in Gilgit-Baltistan. It encompasses nearly the entire district of Hunza. Situated within the valley is the Shimshal River, a tributary that feeds into the Hunza River. Shimshal itself is a border village, serving as a linkage point between Pakistan&#x27;s Gilgit-Baltistan region and China.

The total area of Shimshal is estimated at approximately and there are around two thousand inhabitants with a total of 250 households.

==Settlements==
Shimshal comprises four major hamlets: Farmanabad, Aminabad, Center Shimshal, and Khizarabad. Shimshal obtains hydroelectricity from the Odver stream, particularly during the warmer months of the year which typically span from June to October. The absence of electricity for seven months poses a significant challenge for the local community in Shimshal. During this prolonged period, residents have had to resort to various alternatives such as kerosene oil, firewood, solar panels, and compressed natural gas in cylinders to meet their energy needs However, a small hydro electricity power station of 0.200MW is under construction at Kuk area of Shimshal that is scheduled to be complete in 2017.

The village was inaccessible by motor roads until October 2003, when a new road from the Karakoram Highway at Passu was constructed. It&#x27;s 56 km to reach the Shimshal Valley from Passu. Self-help or Nomus (in local Wakhi language) is the major driver for infrastructure development in Shimshal.

Shimshalis use numerous seasonal mountain grasslands, located several days walk from the village, to sustain herds of yaks, goats, and sheep. The area was founded by Mamo Singh and his wife named Khudija.

The people of Shimshal are Wakhi and they speak the Wakhi language. They belong to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. The community follows Aga Khan, a spiritual leader.

Shimshal has produced several well-known mountaineers for Pakistan. Among those, Samina Baig is the first woman climber from Pakistan to scale Mt. Everest and all highest peaks in seven continents around the globe. Rajab Shah has the honor of scaling all five highest peaks in Pakistan. Both Rajab Shah and Mehrban Shah have received a Presidential Award for Pride of Performance in the field of mountaineering. Some people call Shimshal The Valley of Mountaineers in Pakistan.

Shimshal is the largest village of the Hunza valley. Its extensive pasture lands include Shimshal Pamir, Gujerav, Yazghail and Loopghar.

The Lok Versa Museum of Shimshal has antiques, artifacts, musical instruments, and daily life items made from wood, showcasing the history of its local community.

Two books by Pam Henson about Shimshal, &quot;Shimshal&quot; and &quot;Women of Shimshal,&quot; have been published by the Shimshal Trust. Henson is a teacher from New Zealand and wrote these books based on her experiences teaching and living in Shimshal.

The Shimshal River comes from this area and then transforms the shape of Hunza River, which joins the Indus River below the capital city Gilgit.
Shimshal River is formed from three sources: Khurdopin Glacier, Shimshal Pass and Zardgorban. The Shimshal River flows into the Khunjrab River and then the Passu River before ending in Attabad Lake.

== History ==

The village of Shimshal was founded in 1450 by Mamu Singh, the brother of &quot;Chu Singh&quot;. Both were Burushaski peakers and they belonged to the &quot;Brong Family&quot;. Mamu Singh was fond of hunting and other mountain sports. One day, in search of ibex, he went to Gojal. During his hunting trip, he fell in love with a beautiful girl who he then married. They started to live in the area of Boiber. Once, he climbed up to the summit of Karun Kuh which provided him a chance to view the entire region and to see the grazing ground of Lup Goz, which they traveled to with a flock of sheep and goats.

Later, he climbed on the high ground running east, and saw the vast area of &quot;Shimshal Valley&quot; (Shingshal). He noticed that there were signs of existence of a water channel. He came to the conclusion that this flat barren land had been cultivated some time in the past. Thus, Mamu Singh decided to cultivate the abandoned land. He repaired the broken water channel and got water running through it for irrigation. After cultivations in the new settlement Mamu Singh decided to relocate from Astan to Shimshal along with his wife and herds.. They had a son who went on to produce further descendants, populating the area.

The Pakistan Army came to Shimshal in the late 1960s and was posted in Pamir because of border disputes with China. Many Shimshalis worked as porters for the army. Today, many Shimshalis work as porters for trekking and mountaineering groups and expeditions.

== Shimshal Pass ==


Shimshal Pass () rises above the village. It lies on the watershed between the Indus River and Tarim River basins, and leads to the valley of the Shimshal Braldu River, a tributary of the Shaksgam River on the border with China.

Francis Younghusband was probably the first Englishman to reach the pass (1889). At the time it was used by raiders from Hunza to attack caravans traveling between Leh and Yarkand.

The pass is not part of Khunjerab National Park, but the Shimshal community has set up an organization called SNT (Shimshal Nature Trust) which oversees the entire region and takes care of its own land. It is a community-based organization and is registered with the Government of Pakistan.

Annually, in the last week of July or the first week of August, there is a festival at Shimshal Pass where locals partake in a yak race, followed by singing and dancing. In Wakhi language it is called Woolyo. This yak race is the only one of its kind, and is a unique event organised at high mountain settlements of Pakistan.

==Shimshal Nature Trust==
Shimshal Nature Trust is a community-based development organization. In January 2008, The Science and Practice of Ecology &amp; Society Award (SPES) was granted to Shimshal Nature Trust by the Resilience Alliance.

==Nomus (self-help village development programme)==

Nomus is a Wakhi word commonly known in Shimshal valley. It is a unique social philanthropic (showing concern for humanity) system of the local community. Details are available here Nomus and Oral testimonies from Shimshal. It is one of its kind model of participatory community development in Gilgit-Baltistan area of Pakistan.

==Tourism==
Shimshal Valley has its largest adventure area in Hunza and is a major attraction for tourists. Its well-known mountains include: 
* Distaghil Sar ()
* Kunjut Sar ()
* Trivor ()
* Pumari Chhish (W) ()
* Yukshin Gardan Sar ()
* Momhil Sar ()
* Malungutti Sar ()
* Shimshal Whitehorn ()
* Minglik Sar ()
* Lupghar Sar ()
* Dut Sar ()
* Sonia Peak ()
* Purian Sar ()
* Yazghail Sar ()
* Yawash Sar II ()

Gigantic glaciers include Malangudhi, Yazghail, Khurdopin (), Braldu, Odver, and Ver Zharav. The main passes include Chafchingoal, Khurdopin, Mai Dur, Braldu, and Boi Sam. Among these, the Khurdopin glacier pass remains a favorite destination for trekkers.

There are almost 250 houses in Shimshal and almost every house uses solar panels to generate electricity. On 14 December 2016, Shimshal connected with the rest of the world through a cellular network of the Special Communications Organization known as SCOM. SCOM provides GSM services in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and its GSM service is connected with the solar power grid in Shimshal. Samina Baig, who is Brand Ambassador of SCOM, played a vital role in providing cellular service to the people of Shimshal.

Naubahar School in Shimshal produces 20KVs of electricity using solar panels. This is enough to meet the electricity needs of 18 classrooms and an IT lab.

<text>Isaac Jacob Schoenberg (April 21, 1903 – February 21, 1990) was a Romanian-American mathematician, known for his invention of splines.

==Life and career==
Schoenberg was born in Galați to a Jewish family, the youngest of four children. He studied at the University of Iași, receiving his M.A. in 1922. From 1922 to 1925 he studied at the Universities of Berlin and Göttingen, working on a topic in analytic number theory suggested by Issai Schur. He presented his thesis to the University of Iași, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1926. In Göttingen, he met Edmund Landau, who arranged a visit for Schoenberg to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1928. During this visit, Schoenberg began his work on total positivity and variation-diminishing linear transformations. In 1930, he returned from Jerusalem, and married Landau&#x27;s daughter Charlotte in Berlin.

In 1930, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, which enabled him to go to the United States, visiting the University of Chicago, Harvard, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. From 1935, he taught at Swarthmore College and Colby College. In 1941, he was appointed to the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. During 1943–1945 he was released from U. Penn. in order to perform war work as a mathematician at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. It was during this time that he initiated the work for which he is most famous, the theory of splines.

In 1966 he moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he became a member of the Mathematics Research Center. He remained there until he retired in 1973. In 1974 he won a Lester R. Ford Award.

==Papers==
He wrote about 175 papers on many disparate subjects. Around 50 of these were on Splines. He also wrote on Approximation theory, the Kakeya problem, Polya frequency functions, and a problem of Edmund Landau.
His coauthors included John von Neumann, Hans Rademacher, Theodore Motzkin, George Polya, A. S. Besicovitch, Gábor Szegő, Donald J. Newman, Richard Askey, Bernard Epstein and Carl de Boor.

<doc id="977181" wikidata="Q976163" url="?curid=977181" title="Polyhydramnios">
<text>Polyhydramnios is a medical condition describing an excess of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac. It is seen in about 1% of pregnancies. It is typically diagnosed when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is greater than 24 cm.
There are two clinical varieties of polyhydramnios: chronic polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid accumulates gradually, and acute polyhydramnios where excess amniotic fluid collects rapidly.

The opposite to polyhydramnios is oligohydramnios, not enough amniotic fluid.

==Presentation==
===Associated conditions===
Fetuses with polyhydramnios are at risk for a number of other problems including cord prolapse, placental abruption, premature birth and perinatal death. At delivery the baby should be checked for congenital abnormalities.

==Causes==

In most cases, the exact cause cannot be identified. A single case may have one or more causes, including intrauterine infection (TORCH), rh-isoimmunisation, or chorioangioma of the placenta. In a multiple gestation pregnancy, the cause of polyhydramnios usually is twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Maternal causes include cardiac problems, kidney problems, and maternal diabetes mellitus, which causes fetal hyperglycemia and resulting polyuria (fetal urine is a major source of amniotic fluid).

A recent study distinguishes between mild and severe polyhydramnios and showed that Apgar score of less than 7, perinatal death and structural malformations only occurred in women with severe polyhydramnios. 
In another study, all patients with polyhydramnios, that had a sonographically normal fetus, showed no chromosomal anomalies.

These anomalies include:

*gastrointestinal abnormalities such as esophageal atresia and duodenal atresia (causing inability to swallow amniotic fluid), anencephaly, facial cleft, neck masses, tracheoesophageal fistula, and diaphragmatic hernias. An annular pancreas causing obstruction may also be the cause. 
*Bochdalek&#x27;s hernia, in which the pleuro-peritoneal membranes (especially the left) will fail to develop and seal the pericardio-peritoneal canals. This results in the stomach protrusion up into the thoracic cavity, and the fetus is unable to swallow sufficient amounts of amniotic fluid.
* fetal renal disorders that result in increased urine production during pregnancy, such as in antenatal Bartter syndrome. Molecular diagnosis is available for these conditions. 
*neurological abnormalities such as anencephaly, which impair the swallowing reflex. Anencephaly is failure of closure of the rostral neuropore (rostral neural tube defect). If the rostral neuropore fails to close there will be no neural mechanism for swallowing.
*chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome, which is itself often associated with gastrointestinal abnormalities.
*Skeletal dysplasia, or dwarfism. There is a possibility of the chest cavity not being large enough to house all of the baby&#x27;s organs causing the trachea and esophagus to be restricted, not allowing the baby to swallow the appropriate amount of amniotic fluid.
*sacrococcygeal teratoma

==Diagnosis==
There are several pathologic conditions that can predispose a pregnancy to polyhydramnios. These include a maternal history of diabetes mellitus, Rh incompatibility between the fetus and mother, intrauterine infection, and multiple pregnancies.

During the pregnancy, certain clinical signs may suggest polyhydramnios. In the mother, the physician may observe increased abdominal size out of proportion for her weight gain and gestation age, uterine size that outpaces gestational age, shiny skin with stria (seen mostly in severe polyhydramnios), dyspnea, and chest heaviness. When examining the fetus, faint fetal heart sounds are also an important clinical sign of this condition.

==Treatment==
Mild asymptomatic polyhydramnios is managed expectantly. A woman with symptomatic polyhydramnios may need hospital admission. Antacids may be prescribed to relieve heartburn and nausea.
No data support dietary restriction of salt and fluid.
In some cases, amnioreduction, also known as therapeutic amniocentesis, has been used in response to polyhydramnios.

<text>Oligohydramnios is a medical condition in pregnancy characterized by a deficiency of amniotic fluid, the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the abdomen, in the amniotic sac. The limiting case is anhydramnios, where there is a complete absence of amniotic fluid. It is typically diagnosed by ultrasound when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) measures less than 5 cm or when the single deepest pocket (SDP) of amniotic fluid measures less than 2 cm. Amniotic fluid is necessary to allow for normal fetal movement, lung development, and cushioning from uterine compression. Low amniotic fluid can be attributed to a maternal, fetal, placental or idiopathic cause and can result in poor fetal outcomes including death. The prognosis of the fetus is dependent on the etiology, gestational age at diagnosis, and the severity of the oligohydramnios.

The opposite of oligohydramnios is polyhydramnios, or an excess of amniotic fluid.

==Background==
Amniotic fluid is a clear, watery substance that surrounds the fetus. It helps to maintain a constant temperature around the fetus, cushion it from injury, and allows for proper fetal movement and organ development. The cause of anhydramnios is not always clear, but several factors can contribute to its development such as fetal renal abnormalities or placental insufficiency. Untreated anhydramnios can lead to serious complications for the baby, including pulmonary hypoplasia or skeletal deformities.

==Etiology==
The amount of amniotic fluid available is based on how much fluid is produced and how much is removed from the amniotic sac. In the first trimester, the main sources of amniotic fluid are fetal lung secretions, transportation of maternal plasma across the fetal membranes, and the surface of the placenta. By the second trimester, the fetal kidneys start to produce urine which becomes the main source of the amniotic fluid for the remainder of the pregnancy.

The development of oligohydramnios may be idiopathic or have a maternal, fetal, or placental cause.

===Maternal===
* Conditions such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, collagen vascular disease, nephropathy, and thrombophilia cause uteroplacental insufficiency. These conditions decrease the blood flow to vital organs such as the placenta which supplies blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the developing fetus. Decreased blood flow to the fetus causes impaired urine production which leads to reduced amniotic fluid and oligohydramnios.
* Medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril), prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (NSAIDs, anti-inflammatory steroids), and trastuzumab decrease blood flow to the kidneys of the fetus. When the fetal kidneys are not able to produce adequate amounts of urine, this leads to reduced amniotic fluid or oligohydramnios. Some medications, such as nimesulide and chemotherapeutic agents, have been linked to anhydramnios.
* Maternal dehydration, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive fluid loss.
* Infections such as the TORCH infections (&quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus) and parvovirus B19

===Fetal===
* Chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome which are associated with gastrointestinal abnormalities
* Congenital abnormalities such as renal agenesis and cystic renal disease are associated with impaired urine production, and posterior urethral valves or urethral atresia which are associated with obstruction of the lower urinary tract. Fetal renal abnormalities can encompass various kidney-related issues, including bilateral renal agenesis, also known as Potter syndrome, which is the most prevalent cause of anhydramnios.
* Intrauterine demise
* Post-term pregnancy
* Rupture of membranes
* Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) associated with placental insufficiency. Insufficient fetal growth can result in reduced amniotic fluid volume. When the fetus is not growing appropriately, it may have a reduced ability to produce urine, which is a significant contributor to amniotic fluid.
* &quot;Amnion nodosum&quot;; failure of secretion by the cells of the amnion covering the placenta

===Placental===
* Placental abruption
* Placental insufficiency: This is a condition in which the placenta does not function properly, leading to an insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby, potentially affecting amniotic fluid production.
* Twin-twin transfusion
* Placental thrombosis or infarction

==Diagnosis==

=== Clinical manifestation ===
The volume of amniotic fluid typically increases until 36 weeks and starts decreasing after 40 weeks in post-term gestations. For this reason, discrepancies between fundal height measurements and gestational age can be a clinical indication of amniotic fluid abnormality and should be evaluated by ultrasound. The symptoms of anhydramnios may not always be apparent, but some potential signs include:
* A decrease in the size of the baby&#x27;s abdomen
* Decreased fetal movement
* Uterine contractions not associated with pain

=== Diagnosis ===
Diagnosis of oligohydramnios or anhydramnios is made by conducting a transabdominal ultrasound of the abdomen.

There are two methods that can be used to make the diagnosis: the amniotic fluid index (AFI) and the single deepest pocket (SDP) measuremen. An AFI of less than 5 cm or an SDP of less than 2 cm indicates oligohydramnios, and an AFI of 0 cm or an absent SDP indicates anhydramnios. In measuring the AFI, the sonographer measures the amniotic fluid in each of the four quadrants of the abdomen (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, right lower quadrant, left lower quadrant) and adds the values together. For reference, a normal AFI is 5–25 cm. An AFI &lt;5 cm is considered oligohydramnios and an AFI &gt;25 cm is considered polyhydramnios. Randomized control trials have shown that use of AFI can cause an increased number of false positive diagnosis of oligohydramnios and recommend using the measurement of a single deepest pocket (SDP) of amniotic fluid to diagnose oligohydramnios instead.

To calculate a single deepest pocket, the sonographer scans each of the four quadrants of the abdomen looking for the deepest pocket of amniotic fluid that does not include any fetal body parts or an umbilical cord. It is measured from the 12 o&#x27;clock position to the 6 o&#x27;clock position. For reference, a normal SDP is 2–8 cm. A SDP &lt;2 cm is considered oligohydramnios and a SDP &gt;8 cm is considered polyhydramnios. The use of a SDP for diagnosis of oligohydramnios is associated with less false positives and thus less unnecessary interventions without an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes.

In a multiple gestation pregnancy, measuring a single deepest pocket is the most accurate determination of adequate amniotic fluid levels.

==Management==
After initial diagnosis of oligohydramnios has been made, the next step is to perform a thorough history and physical exam, followed by diagnostic testing if indicated. Timely diagnosis and proper intervention for anhydramnios can significantly enhance the outlook for infants affected by this condition. The treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include:
* Amnioinfusion: Injection of amniotic fluid into the womb, can help to improve fetal lung development and reduce the risk of complications
* Fetal monitoring: Close monitoring of the fetus is crucial to assess its well-being and detect any potential complications
* Delivery: The timing of delivery may need to be adjusted depending on the severity of anhydramnios and the health of the fetus

Other point to note are:
* Retaking a maternal and family history and performing a physical exam can point to maternal conditions or medications that might be causing the oligohydramnios.
* Premature prelabor rupture of membranes or prelabor rupture of membranes is ruled out with a nitrizine test, evidence of ferning, or evidence pooling of liquid in the cervix.
* Sonographic evaluation of the fetus is done to identify fetal anomalies, aneuploidy, fetal growth restriction, or placental abnormalities. The National Institute of Health recommends detailed documentation of certain fetal organs that are most likely to be involved such as the kidneys, bladder, and the umbilical cord. If the lack of amniotic fluid prevents accurate visualization on ultraosund, MRI imaging can be considered. Genetic testing can be useful if fetal anomalies are documented on imaging.
* An elevated maternal serum alpha fetal protein (MSAFP) can indicate leaking amniotic fluid due to damage to fetal membranes or the placenta. This is associated with a poor prognosis.
* A maternal blood test or amniotic fluid test can be performed if suspicion of a TORCH infection is high.

=== Increasing amniotic fluid ===
There is no way to permanently increase the volume of amniotic fluid, but it can be temporarily increased to allow for a complete anatomy scan of the fetus on ultrasound.

One way to achieve this is through an amnioinfusion, which is the insertion of 200 mL of saline into the amniotic sac. One study showed an improvement in fetal structure visibility by 26% (51% to 77% before and after the infusion respectively). There is also some low quality data that may indicate a potential benefit of amnioinfusion is to facilitate external cephalic version. Amnioinfusion can be used during labor to prevent umbilical cord compression. There is uncertainty about the procedure&#x27;s safety and efficacy, and it is recommended that it should only be performed in centers specializing in invasive fetal medicine and in the context of a multidisciplinary team.

One to two liters of oral hydration can temporarily increase amniotic fluid in dehydrated patients with isolated oligohydramnios.

Other investigational therapies may also be useful such as desmopressin, tissue sealants, or sildenafil citrate. These methods are less commonly used and are experimental.

In case of congenital lower urinary tract obstruction, fetal surgery seems to improve survival, according to a randomized yet small study.

=== Prenatal care ===
Patients who are preterm are managed in the outpatient setting with weekly or biweekly testing to monitor for accurate fetal growth and decrease chances of unexpected fetal death. This includes a weekly non-stress test (NST) and single deepest pocket (SDP) assessment which is also referred to as the modified BPP. Sonographic fetal growth exams may also be indicated.

=== Timing of delivery ===
Idiopathic, uncomplicated, and persistent oligohydramnios can be delivered at 36 0/7 weeks – 37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosis is later.

===Complications===
Complications may include cord compression, musculoskeletal abnormalities such as facial distortion and clubfoot, pulmonary hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction. Amnion nodosum is frequently also present (nodules on the fetal surface of the amnion).

The use of oligohydramnios as a predictor of gestational complications is controversial.

Potter syndrome is a condition caused by oligohydramnios. Affected fetuses develop pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformities, and characteristic facies. Bilateral agenesis of the fetal kidneys is the most common cause due to the lack of fetal urine.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of anhydramnios depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the condition. In general, the prognosis is poor for babies with anhydramnios caused by fetal renal abnormalities, with a high mortality rate. However, the prognosis is better for babies with anhydramnios caused by other factors, such as premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

Factors that affect the prognosis of anhydramnios include:
* The underlying cause of the anhydramnios: Babies with anhydramnios caused by fetal renal abnormalities have a much poorer prognosis than babies with anhydramnios caused by other factors.
* The severity of the anhydramnios: Babies with severe anhydramnios have a poorer prognosis than babies with mild anhydramnios.
* The gestational age at diagnosis: Babies with anhydramnios diagnosed in the early stages of pregnancy have a poorer prognosis than babies with anhydramnios diagnosed in the later stages of pregnancy.
* The presence of other complications: Babies with anhydramnios who also have other complications, such as fetal growth restriction or skeletal deformities, have a poorer prognosis than babies with anhydramnios who do not have other complications.

With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, many babies with anhydramnios can be born healthy. However, the prognosis for babies with anhydramnios caused by fetal renal abnormalities remains poor. These babies may require long-term medical care and may have developmental disabilities.

==Motion pictures==

Many motion pictures portray mental illness in inaccurate ways, leading to misunderstanding and heightened stigmatization of the mentally ill. However, some movies are lauded for dispelling stereotypes and providing insight into mental illness. In a study by George Gerbner, it was determined that 5 percent of &#x27;normal&#x27; television characters are murderers, while 20% of &#x27;mentally-ill&#x27; characters are murderers. 40% of normal characters are violent, while 70% of mentally-ill characters are violent. Contrary to what is portrayed in films and television, Henry J. Steadman, Ph.D., and his colleagues at Policy Research Associates found that, overall, formal mental patients did not have a higher rate of violence than the control group of people who were not formal mental patients. In both groups, however, substance abuse was linked to a higher rate of violence. (Hockenbury and Hockenbury, 2004)

* &quot;Psycho&quot;, a 1960 American film which features a man who exhibits multiple personality-disorder (includes several prequels or sequels or remakes)
* &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot;, a 1993 American film which features a woman with schizophrenia.
* &quot;Memento&quot;, a 2000 psychological thriller film about a man with anterograde amnesia which renders his brain unable to store new memories.
* &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, a 2001 film which is a fictionalised account of a mathematician with schizophrenia, John Nash.
* &quot;The Soloist&quot;, a 2009 film depicting the true story of Nathaniel Ayers, a musical prodigy who develops schizophrenia during his second year at Juilliard School, becomes homeless and plays a two stringed violin in the streets of Downtown Los Angeles.
* &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, a 2012 film about a bipolar man and his relationship with a depressed young widow.

==Video games==
The game &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot; of the same genres contains three major characters struggling with mental illness. Though their conditions are never named, two of these characters exhibit symptoms which, together with their backstories, may suggest acute dissociative amnesia; while the third character most definitively approximates body dysmorphic disorder. (The topic of dissociative amnesia is revisited in later installments of the series.) In addition, both this game and &quot;Silent Hill 3&quot; mention various former patients of the now-abandoned town&#x27;s local psychiatric hospital, with one said patient making an appearance in the latter game.
&quot;Life is Strange&quot; deals with depression, suicide most notably, as the main character Max tries to prevent the suicide of one of her friends. One of the characters exhibits concerning behaviors and is prescribed medicines most often associated with bipolar and schizophrenia.

&quot;&quot; deals with a side character named Toko Fukawa who suffers from DID. Her first identity being a well-known writer. Her second identity was a serial killer. The next character who has a canon mental illness is Nagito Komaeda, a loved character from &quot;Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair&quot; who suffers from lymphoma in stage 3 and has Frontotemporal dementia.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; implies numerous times that the main character, Cloud Strife, has some form of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as well as post-traumatic stress disorder.

In &quot;Pokémon Sword and Shield&quot;, Chairman Rose is shown to have a severe idée fixe about a far-off energy crisis.

<doc id="977193" wikidata="Q387914" url="?curid=977193" title="Halocarbon">
<text>Halocarbon compounds are chemical compounds in which one or more carbon atoms are linked by covalent bonds with one or more halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine – ) resulting in the formation of organofluorine compounds, organochlorine compounds, organobromine compounds, and organoiodine compounds. Chlorine halocarbons are the most common and are called organochlorides.

Many synthetic organic compounds such as plastic polymers, and a few natural ones, contain halogen atoms; they are known as &quot;halogenated&quot; compounds or &quot;organohalogens&quot;. Organochlorides are the most common industrially used organohalides, although the other organohalides are used commonly in organic synthesis. Except for extremely rare cases, organohalides are not produced biologically, but many pharmaceuticals are organohalides. Notably, many pharmaceuticals such as Prozac have trifluoromethyl groups.

For information on inorganic halide chemistry, see halide.

== Chemical families ==

Halocarbons are typically classified in the same ways as the similarly structured organic compounds that have hydrogen atoms occupying the molecular sites of the halogen atoms in halocarbons. Among the chemical families are:
*haloalkanes—compounds with carbon atoms linked by single bonds
*haloalkenes—compounds with one or more double bonds between carbon atoms
*haloaromatics—compounds with carbons linked in one or more aromatic rings with a delocalised donut shaped pi cloud.
The halogen atoms in halocarbon molecules are often called &quot;substituents,&quot; as though those atoms had been substituted for hydrogen atoms. However halocarbons are prepared in many ways that do not involve direct substitution of halogens for hydrogens.

== History and context ==
A few halocarbons are produced in massive amounts by microorganisms. For example, several million tons of methyl bromide are estimated to be produced by marine organisms annually. Most of the halocarbons encountered in everyday life – solvents, medicines, plastics – are man-made. The first synthesis of halocarbons was achieved in the early 1800s. Production began accelerating when their useful properties as solvents and anesthetics were discovered. Development of plastics and synthetic elastomers has led to greatly expanded scale of production. A substantial percentage of drugs are halocarbons.

=== Natural halocarbons ===
A large amount of the naturally occurring halocarbons, such as dioxine, are created by wood fire and volcanic activity. A third major source is marine algae, which produce several chlorinated methane and ethane containing compounds. Several thousand complex halocarbons are known to be produced mainly by marine species. Although chlorine compounds are the majority of the discovered compounds, bromides, iodides and fluorides have also been found in nature. Tyrian purple is a bromide and is produced by certain sea snails. Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland and is an iodide. The highly toxic fluoroacetate is one of the rare natural organofluorides and is produced by certain plants.

== Organoiodine compounds, including biological derivatives ==

Organoiodine compounds, called organic iodides, are similar in structure to organochlorine and organobromine compounds, but the C-I bond is weaker. Many organic iodides are known, but few are of major industrial importance. Iodide compounds are mainly produced as nutritional supplements.

The thyroxin hormones are essential for human health, hence the usefulness of iodized salt.

Six mg of iodide a day can be used to treat patients with hyperthyroidism due to its ability to inhibit the organification process in thyroid hormone synthesis, the so-called Wolff–Chaikoff effect. Prior to 1940, iodides were the predominant antithyroid agents. In large doses, iodides inhibit proteolysis of thyroglobulin, which permits TH to be synthesized and stored in colloid, but not released into the bloodstream. This mechanism is referred to as Plummer effect.

This treatment is seldom used today as a stand-alone therapy despite the rapid improvement of patients immediately following administration. The major disadvantage of iodide treatment lies in the fact that excessive stores of TH accumulate, slowing the onset of action of thioamides (TH synthesis blockers). In addition, the functionality of iodides fades after the initial treatment period. An &quot;escape from block&quot; is also a concern, as extra stored TH may spike following discontinuation of treatment.

== Uses ==

The first halocarbon commercially used was Tyrian purple, a natural organobromide of the &quot;Murex brandaris&quot; marine snail.

Common uses for halocarbons have been as solvents, pesticides, refrigerants, fire-resistant oils, ingredients of elastomers, adhesives and sealants, electrically insulating coatings, plasticizers, and plastics. Many halocarbons have specialized uses in industry. One halocarbon, sucralose, is a sweetener.

Before they became strictly regulated, the general public often encountered haloalkanes as paint and cleaning solvents such as trichloroethane (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane), pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for chlorodifluoromethane). Some haloalkanes are still widely used for industrial cleaning, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and as refrigerants, such as R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).

Haloalkenes have also been used as solvents, including perchloroethylene (Perc, tetrachloroethene), widespread in dry cleaning, and trichloroethylene (TCE, 1,1,2-trichloroethene). Other haloalkenes have been chemical building blocks of plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (&quot;vinyl&quot; or PVC, polymerized chloroethene) and Teflon (duPont trademark for polymerized tetrafluoroethene, PTFE).

Haloaromatics include the former Aroclors (Monsanto Company trademark for polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), once widely used in power transformers and capacitors and in building caulk, the former Halowaxes (Union Carbide trademark for polychlorinated naphthalenes, PCNs), once used for electrical insulation, and the chlorobenzenes and their derivatives, used for disinfectants, pesticides such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane), herbicides such as 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), askarel dielectrics (mixed with PCBs, no longer used in most countries), and chemical feedstocks.

A few halocarbons, including acid halides like acetyl chloride, are highly reactive; these are rarely found outside chemical processing. The widespread uses of halocarbons were often driven by observations that most of them were more stable than other substances. They may be less affected by acids or alkalis; they may not burn as readily; they may not be attacked by bacteria or molds; or they may not be affected as much by sun exposure.

== Hazards ==

The stability of halocarbons tended to encourage beliefs that they were mostly harmless, although in the mid-1920s physicians reported workers in polychlorinated naphthalene (PCN) manufacturing suffering from chloracne , and by the late 1930s it was known that workers exposed to PCNs could die from liver disease and that DDT would kill mosquitos and other insects . By the 1950s, there had been several reports and investigations of workplace hazards. In 1956, for example, after testing hydraulic oils containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)s, the U.S. Navy found that skin contact caused fatal liver disease in animals and rejected them as &quot;too toxic for use in a submarine&quot; .
In 1962 a book by U.S. biologist Rachel Carson started a storm of concerns about environmental pollution, first focused on DDT and other pesticides, some of them also halocarbons. These concerns were amplified when in 1966 Danish chemist Soren Jensen reported widespread residues of PCBs among Arctic and sub-Arctic fish and birds . In 1974, Mexican chemist Mario Molina and U.S. chemist Sherwood Rowland predicted that common halocarbon refrigerants, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), would accumulate in the upper atmosphere and destroy protective ozone . Within a few years, ozone depletion was being observed above Antarctica, leading to bans on production and use of chlorofluorocarbons in many countries. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said halocarbons were a direct cause of global warming.

Since the 1970s there have been longstanding, unresolved controversies over potential health hazards of trichloroethylene (TCE) and other halocarbon solvents that had been widely used for industrial cleaning . More recently perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a precursor in the most common manufacturing process for Teflon and also used to make coatings for fabrics and food packaging, became a health and environmental concern starting in 2006 , suggesting that halocarbons, though thought to be among the most inert, may also present hazards.

Halocarbons, including those that might not be hazards in themselves, can present waste disposal issues. Because they do not readily degrade in natural environments, halocarbons tend to accumulate. Incineration and accidental fires can create corrosive byproducts such as hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid, and poisons like halogenated dioxins and furans. Species of Desulfitobacterium are being investigated for their potential in the bioremediation of halogenic organic compounds.

<doc id="977199" wikidata="Q928448" url="?curid=977199" title="Red (King Crimson album)">
<text>Red is the seventh studio album by English progressive rock band King Crimson, released on 6 October 1974 on Island Records in the United Kingdom and Atlantic Records in North America and Japan. The album was recorded at Olympic Studios in London in July and August 1974, and produced by the band themselves.

&quot;Red&quot; is a progressive rock album with a noticeably heavier sound than their previous albums; it was later called one of the 50 &quot;heaviest albums of all time&quot; by &quot;Q&quot;. This was achieved with the performances of just three band members: guitarist and keyboardist Robert Fripp, bassist and vocalist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford. The dense sound of the album was created through multiple guitar and keyboard overdubs and guest appearances by musicians including former King Crimson members Ian McDonald and Mel Collins on saxophones, classical oboist Robin Miller and English jazz trumpeter Mark Charig. Many of the album&#x27;s motifs were conceived during the band&#x27;s live improvisations. The track &quot;Providence&quot; was edited down from an improvisation recorded by the previous lineup of the band, with violinist and keyboardist David Cross in addition to Fripp, Wetton and Bruford, at a live performance in Providence, Rhode Island; Cross had been fired from the band by the time the album sessions began. &quot;Starless&quot; was originally written for their previous album, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; (1974), but was considered too primitive to be released at the time; the lengthy version included on &quot;Red&quot; was refined and performed during concerts throughout 1974.

Fripp disbanded King Crimson roughly two weeks before the release of the album. &quot;Red&quot; became their lowest-charting album at that time, spending only one week in the UK Albums Chart at No. 45 and in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 66. However, it was well received among fans and critics. It has received further praise retrospectively, being recognised as one of the band&#x27;s best works, and has been reissued many times.

== Background and recording ==
Near the conclusion of King Crimson&#x27;s 1974 US and Canada tour, the decision was made to ask David Cross to leave the band. EG, the band&#x27;s management, urged Fripp not to tell Cross until after the final date of the tour, but he would not have been able to do this anyway as Fripp would not return from the US until after Cross arrived in Europe. Fripp agreed that EG management would tell Cross, &quot;on proviso that [Cross] was told that I objected to not telling him personally.&quot; However, EG failed to inform Cross at all, waiting until 7 July, the day before the recording of &quot;Red&quot; began.

With the exception of &quot;Providence&quot;, which had been recorded live during the tour, &quot;Red&quot; was recorded in July and August 1974 at Studio 2 of Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. The band reunited with recording engineer George Chkiantz, who had previously worked with them on &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;. Chkiantz remembered Fripp placing himself and his guitar amplifier in the drummer&#x27;s booth, &quot;sitting on a stool with the light off, quite possibly with the door pulled to, basically playing when the stuff was counted in.&quot; Once Bruford was no longer needed in the studio, he cycled home, leaving Wetton and Chkiantz to record the vocals. With the backing tracks put down, the band brought back several contributors to past albums in Cross&#x27;s stead: Robin Miller on oboe, Mark Charig on cornet, former King Crimson members Ian McDonald and Mel Collins on saxophones, and multiple uncredited players on cello and double bass.

On &quot;Red&quot;, King Crimson followed in the direction established by its predecessors &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; (1973) and &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; (1974). However, in contrast to those albums, &quot;Red&quot; features a more &quot;layered&quot; production, characterized by guitar and keyboard overdubs and the use of McDonald and Collins as session musicians. The rhythm section of Wetton and Bruford, whom Fripp referred to as &quot;a flying brick wall&quot;, led the album&#x27;s style towards heavy metal. Fripp, increasingly unsure of the group&#x27;s direction, took a &quot;backseat&quot; when making large decisions during the sessions, leaving them to Wetton and Bruford; the two believed Fripp was merely &quot;pulling another moody&quot;, but in the week prior to recording &quot;Red,&quot; Fripp had discovered the works of mystic John G. Bennett and decided to take &quot;a year&#x27;s sabbatical ... at Bennett&#x27;s Institute&quot; afterwards. He offered the idea of McDonald rejoining the band in his absence to EG; in light of the label&#x27;s lack of interest in this idea, Fripp abruptly disbanded King Crimson on 24 September. &quot;Red&quot; was released two weeks later.

== Music and lyrics ==
Much of the material on &quot;Red&quot; has origins in the band&#x27;s live improvisations. Motifs that would eventually be used for &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; were first played by Fripp in 1972 as part of improvisations performed with the quintet line-up that recorded &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;; these improvisations are documented as &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel Hullabaloo&quot; on the &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings&quot; box set and in standalone releases of their respective concerts. The song also used the chorus of a then-unreleased ballad by Wetton, &quot;Woman&quot;, as an instrumental passage. Wetton later released the complete song on his first solo album, &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot;, in 1980.

The distinctive introduction to &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; was deployed by Wetton and Fripp in various improvisations throughout 1974, which can be heard in the &quot;Starless&quot; and &quot;The Road to Red&quot; box sets. &quot;Providence&quot; was edited down from a recording of an improvisation on 30 June 1974 in Providence, Rhode Island. It was released in its uncut form as &quot;Improv: Providence&quot; on several subsequent releases, such as the 1992 &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot; live box set and the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;Red&quot;.

The opening instrumental &quot;Red&quot; was composed solely by Fripp. Composer Andrew Keeling described it as &quot;one of the more muscular pieces of Robert Fripp&#x27;s, in particular the deployment of open strings and heavily attacked and syncopated bass and drums.&quot; In an online diary from 2012, Fripp wrote about its development: &quot;A motif; moved from [the missing piece] &quot;Blue&quot; to &quot;Red&quot;: the opening and closing theme of &quot;Red&quot; itself. The driving, relentless figure that follows it, and the middle figure played by the basses, weren&#x27;t enough for a complete piece.&quot; Once the track was put down Fripp recalled: &quot;We played it back and Bill said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t get it, but if you tell me it&#x27;s good, I trust you.&#x27; ... I said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t have to use it.&#x27; John was in no doubt: &#x27;We&#x27;ll use it.&#x27;&quot; An unused variation of the song&#x27;s middle section would later emerge in the rehearsals for &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; (1984), as later collected on &quot;Rehearsals &amp; Blows&quot;, and finally saw light as part of &quot;VROOOM VROOOM&quot; on &quot;THRAK&quot; (1995).

&quot;Starless&quot; was originally written by Wetton, with the intent of it being the title track for &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;. At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a &quot;cold reception&quot; from Fripp and Bruford. Fripp later wrote an introductory theme performed on violin by Cross, and two additional sections were added after Wetton&#x27;s contributions, one being contributed by Bruford. The final section reprises various themes heard earlier in the song and reuses a bass part originally written for the &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; track &quot;Fracture&quot;. This early arrangement of &quot;Fracture&quot; can be heard on the &quot;Starless&quot; box set, as well as the standalone releases of various concerts. The lyrics, co-written by Wetton and lyricist Richard Palmer-James, went through several iterations, with Wetton later including an unused verse in the U.K. track &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Palace Blues&quot;. Since the title &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; had already been used on the previous album, the song&#x27;s title was shortened to &quot;Starless&quot;.

==Packaging==
During the mixing stage, ideas for the album&#x27;s title and artwork were discussed. The needles on the meters on the studio&#x27;s mixing desk were observed to be &quot;bouncing and crashing sharply into the red&quot;; for Wetton, this symbolised the direction of the band&#x27;s music and was to influence the planned front cover of &quot;Red&quot;. However, EG suggested that a group photograph would be easier to sell, particularly for the American market. EG director Mark Fenwick pitched to hire John Kosh, who subsequently commissioned Gered Mankowitz to produce photographs of the meters (for the album&#x27;s back cover) and the group, but tensions within the group led to each member being photographed alone and being combined into a composite. The resulting cover&#x27;s chiaroscuro style has been compared to that of the Beatles&#x27; 1963 album &quot;With the Beatles&quot;; Fripp recalled that &quot;I loathed the session and was ill at ease with all of it.&quot;

The album&#x27;s lyrics were not originally included as part of the packaging, unlike all previous King Crimson studio albums. The first printing of the lyrics would occur in a 2000 reissue.

==Release and reception==
Released in October 1974, &quot;Red&quot; spent only one week on the British charts, at No. 45, whereas all the band&#x27;s previous studio albums had reached the top 30. In the United States, it reached No. 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it remained popular with fans and critics. Critic Robert Christgau applauded the album despite having been critical of the group&#x27;s past work; he deemed it &quot;grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical&quot; and commented that it &quot;does for classical-rock fusion what John McLaughlin&#x27;s &quot;Devotion&quot; did for jazz-rock fusion.&quot; At the time of release, &quot;Sounds&quot; reporter Steve Peacock believed the group disbanding was merely a marketing ploy to boost sales.

Retrospective reviews were resoundingly positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic declared &quot;Red&quot; to be weaker than its two predecessors, but nonetheless a superlative work: &quot;few intact groups could have gotten an album as good as &quot;Red&quot; together. The fact that it was put together by a band in its death throes makes it all the more impressive an achievement.&quot; Greg Kot of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; praised &quot;Red&quot; as &quot;progressive rock&#x27;s finest hour&quot; in 1997. A &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reviewer considered it &quot;a walk down a lightless corridor and an unhappy and ferocious counterbalance to the frolics of King Crimson&#x27;s beginnings&quot; and &quot;laden with heavily distorted sections and a decidedly melancholic vibe&quot;.

Like most of King Crimson&#x27;s catalogue, &quot;Red&quot; has been re-released numerous times. First issued on Compact Disc in 1986, it has also been released as part of the &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; series in 1989 and the &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; series in 1999. In 2009, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; and &quot;Lizard&quot; were chosen to launch the band&#x27;s &quot;40th Anniversary Edition&quot; series, in which each album was presented in a CD/DVD-A package with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Steven Wilson; unlike the other editions in the series, however, &quot;Red&quot; launched with no new stereo mix. In 2013, Wilson and Fripp created a new stereo mix for &quot;The Road To Red&quot; box set, which was also issued separately as part of a 2CD package. In October 2024, a &quot;50th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on vinyl, CD/Blu-Ray &amp; digital formats, with a new elemental mix by David Singleton, which included elements not on the original mixes, and both a new stereo and Dolby Atmos remix by Steven Wilson. Also included were session tracks detailing the creation of Starless.

==Legacy==
In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; magazine named &quot;Red&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Heaviest Albums of All Time&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Red&quot; number 72 in its &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot; list, stating: &quot;For a band that was very obviously about to splinter, King Crimson&#x27;s music sounds remarkably of a single mind. On &quot;Red&quot;, they achieved a remarkable balance between bone-crushing brutality and cerebral complexity.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 15 on their 2015 list of the 50 best progressive rock albums of all time.

The title track was also ranked as the twentieth best progressive rock song of all time by &quot;PopMatters&quot;, as well as number 87 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs&quot;. &quot;Red&quot; has been regarded as being highly influential to the development of avant-garde metal and math rock. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain mentioned &quot;Red&quot; as an influence on the band&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;In Utero&quot;.

Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider &quot;Red&quot;, particularly the track &quot;Starless&quot;, to be the highlight of King Crimson&#x27;s recorded output. &quot;Starless&quot; is played over the opening titles of the 2018 horror film &quot;Mandy&quot;.

<text>The Austrian Grand Prix () is a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile sanctioned motor racing event that was held in , –, and –. It returned to the Formula One calendar in , where it has remained since then. It was first held at the Zeltweg Air Base for its first, non-Championship running. Since 1970, the race has been held at the Österreichring, currently known as the Red Bull Ring due to its ownership by the Austrian drinks company of the same name. Ever since it returned to the calendar, the Austrian Grand Prix is typically held during the mid-season rounds of the Formula One World Championship, with one exception: the Austrian Grand Prix was held as the season opener in , due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns disrupting the season. Also in 2020, an additional race, held also at the Red Bull Ring, was added to the calendar called the Styrian Grand Prix, which was held twice, facilitating a double-header to maximise the number of Grands Prix during seasons that were affected by the pandemic.

== History ==
The Austrian Grand Prix has been held at two different locations in southeastern Austria, being originally held in Zeltweg, about west of Graz. Since 1969 the Austrian Grand Prix has taken place in neighbouring Spielberg, with the two venues being within approximately of each other. It was first held at the Zeltweg Air Base for six years, before a permanent track, originally called the Österreichring and later known as the A-1 ring and Red Bull Ring, was built.

=== Zeltweg Airfield circuit ===

A non-championship event was held in 1963 at a race track on the Zeltweg Airfield and it was won by Australian Jack Brabham. The first championship event took place in the following year, and Italian Lorenzo Bandini won his only Formula One championship race in a Ferrari. The race was a success, but the track was deemed too dangerous; it was narrow and very bumpy, and spectators complained of poor viewing areas. The FIA removed the race from the F1 calendar until a suitable track was built.

The event was run in 1965 as a non-championship sports car race, the Zeltweg 200 Miles, before being adopted by the World Sportscar Championship from 1966 to 1969 as the 1000 km Zeltweg.

=== Österreichring ===

From 1970 until 1987, the event was held at the Österreichring (translated literally as &quot;Austria circuit&quot;, also located near Zeltweg). It was built in the scenic Styrian mountains and it was a fast, flowing track where every corner was high speed and long. The Austrian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix once, 1975, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. The very fast track was popular with drivers, and the events were moderately successful. The first race on this track was dominated by Ferrari, with their more powerful Flat-12 engines enabled them to be 10 mph faster – which is a lot in racing terms. The 1971 race saw Swiss driver Jo Siffert dominate in his BRM and Briton Jackie Stewart took his second Drivers&#x27; Championship. The 1975 event was marred by the fatal accident of American Mark Donohue, and the race itself was rain-soaked and was won by Vittorio Brambilla, winning the only F1 race of his career, and, true to form, he crashed into the guardrail and broke the nose of his car shortly after crossing the finish line when the race was stopped early because the rain got worse (although the race started after 1 hour and 15 minutes of delay, due the heavy rain, with the drivers doing extra practice during this time). In 1976, home favourite Niki Lauda&#x27;s appalling crash at the Nürburgring caused him to miss the race, which was won by Briton John Watson in the short-lived Penske F1 team, winning his first Formula One race (and Penske&#x27;s only win in the category).

1976 had seen the Voest-Hugel corner changed slightly into one corner instead of two corners; but 1977 saw a slow three-corner chicane installed at Voest-Hugel, which was where Donohue had crashed two years before. What was the fastest corner on the track was now the slowest corner there and would become known as the Hella-Licht Chicane. This race was won by Australian Alan Jones in a Shadow; and like with Brambilla and Watson, it was his first Grand Prix victory. 1978 saw the dominant Lotus 79s on the front row, and American Mario Andretti crashed at the Glatz Kurve on the first lap, and his teammate, Swede Ronnie Peterson took victory. 1979 started to show the superiority of turbo-charged engines on this fast and high-altitude circuit. Although Jones won again in a Williams, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Rene Arnoux in their Renaults were able to dominate this event and also the following year&#x27;s race, which Jabouille won. 1981 saw three turbo-charged cars dominate the front row; and into the race, the immense power and dreadful handling of Didier Pironi&#x27;s Ferrari helped him to hold up four better handling cars and get into a five-way battle for third place, which went on for a while but the four cars eventually passed him, one of which was Jacques Laffite who went on to win the race. 1982 saw a spectacular show in which five turbocharged cars dominated the grid; all but one of these cars retired with mechanical problems, including Italian Riccardo Patrese who had a spectacular accident at the Texaco Bends, and Frenchman Alain Prost whose engine expired with a few laps to go while in the lead. After Prost&#x27;s retirement, the race turned into a dead-heat sprint between Italian Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams. In the beginning, Rosberg had been steadily chipping away at de Angelis; but after Prost retired, Rosberg began to make up 1.5 seconds a lap on de Angelis; and on the last lap the two so-far winless drivers battled for victory, and de Angelis was able to hold off Rosberg and win by less than half a car&#x27;s length; 0.05 seconds. 1984 saw Lauda finally take victory at home Grand Prix in his McLaren, and Prost won the next two races. The 1985 race saw a fearsome crash at the Panorama Curve when Andrea de Cesaris spectacularly rolled his Ligier, which led to him being fired from the team. 1986 saw Austrian driver Gerhard Berger lead the early laps in his Benetton-BMW, but electrical problems saw his race ruined allowing Alain Prost to take the win by over a lap from the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson.

The 1987 race was restarted twice due to accidents on the narrow pit-straight grid; and this track was also deemed too dangerous by FIA standards, because of the number of high-speed corners, lack of protection from trees and embankments and accidents at the start of many races on the narrow and confined pit straight. Increasing speeds were also a growing problem at the Österreichring: that year, polesitter Nelson Piquet averaged 159.457 mph (255.756 km/h) in his 1,100 hp Honda-powered Williams. Piquet finished second to his teammate, Briton Nigel Mansell. Attempts to bring the race back were unsuccessful, and the event disappeared for a decade.

=== A1-Ring ===
In 1995 and 1996, the Österreichring was refurbished and brought up to date, which allowed the race to run again in 1997. Since the track, which was renamed A1-Ring after a sponsor, is located on the municipal territory of Spielberg, Spielberg was now given as the site of the Grand Prix. The whole layout was redesigned by Hermann Tilke, and the track lost all of its long, sweeping corners, aside from the Texaco Bends (which were made shorter and slower) and the Hella-Licht chicane, Flatschach, Dr. Tiroch curve and the first half of the backstretch run up to where the Bosch-Kurve was taken out and replaced with a bypass that went directly to the second half of the fast, uphill backstretch. The 2002 event received negative publicity after Ferrari instructed Rubens Barrichello to cede his victory to Michael Schumacher. It was a mainstay on the calendar until hosting its final race in 2003.

=== Red Bull Ring ===

In July 2013, it was reported that the circuit&#x27;s new owners Red Bull GmbH had reached an agreement with Bernie Ecclestone to revive the Austrian Grand Prix after a ten-year absence from the calendar. The race was given a provisional date of July 2014. On 6 December, the officially released calendar included the Austrian Grand Prix on it.

<doc id="977206" wikidata="Q4116750" url="?curid=977206" title="Stabilator">
<text>A stabilator is a fully movable aircraft horizontal stabilizer. It serves the usual functions of longitudinal stability, control and stick force requirements otherwise performed by the separate parts of a conventional horizontal stabilizer (which is fixed) and elevator (which is adjustable). Apart from reduced drag, particularly at high Mach numbers, it is a useful device for changing the aircraft balance within wide limits, and for reducing stick forces.

Stabilator is a portmanteau of &quot;stabilizer&quot; and &quot;elevator&quot;. It is also known as an all-moving tailplane (British English), all-movable tail(plane), all-moving stabilizer, all-flying tail (American English), all-flying horizontal tail, full-flying stabilizer, and slab tailplane.

==General aviation==
Because it involves a moving balanced surface, a stabilator can allow the pilot to generate a given pitching moment with a lower control force. Due to the high forces involved in tail balancing loads, stabilators are designed to pivot about their aerodynamic center (near the tail&#x27;s mean quarter-chord). This is the point at which the pitching moment is constant regardless of the angle of attack, and thus any movement of the stabilator can be made without added pilot effort. However, to be certified by the appropriate regulatory agency, an airplane must show an increasing resistance to an increasing pilot input (movement). To provide this resistance, stabilators on small aircraft contain an anti-servo tab (usually acting also as a trim tab) that deflects in the same direction as the stabilator, thus providing an aerodynamic force resisting the pilot&#x27;s input. General aviation aircraft with stabilators include the Piper Cherokee and the Cessna 177. The Glaser-Dirks DG-100 glider initially used a stabilator without an anti-servo tab to increase resistance: as a result, the pitch movement of the glider is very sensitive. Later models used a conventional stabilizer and elevator.

==Military==
All-flying tailplanes were used on many pioneer aircraft and the popular Morane-Saulnier G, H and L monoplanes from France as well as the early Fokker Eindecker monoplane and Halberstadt D.II biplane fighters from Germany all flew with them, although at the cost of stability: none of these aircraft, with the possible exception of the biplane Halberstadts, could be flown hands-off.

Stabilators were developed to achieve adequate pitch control in supersonic flight, and are almost universal on modern military combat aircraft.

The British wartime Miles M.52 supersonic project was designed with stabilators. Though the design only flew as a scale rocket, its all-flying tail was tested on the Miles Falcon. The contemporary American supersonic project, the Bell X-1, used separately-adjustable horizontal stabilizer and elevators allowing movement as a single surface or elevator deflection at a fixed tailplane setting.

Entering service in 1951, the Boeing B-47 Stratojet was the world&#x27;s first purposely built jet bomber to include one piece stabilator design. A stabilator was considered for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress but rejected due to the unreliability of hydraulics at the time.

The North American F-86 Sabre, the first U.S. Air Force aircraft which could go supersonic (although in a shallow dive) was introduced with a conventional horizontal stabilizer with elevators, which was eventually replaced with a stabilator.

When stabilators can move differentially to perform the roll control function of ailerons, as they do on many modern fighter aircraft they are known as elevons or rolling tails. A canard surface, looking like a stabilator but not stabilizing like a tailplane, can also be mounted in front of the main wing in a canard configuration (Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender).

Stabilators on military aircraft have the same problem of too light control forces (inducing overcontrol) as general aviation aircraft. Unlike light aircraft, supersonic aircraft are not fitted with anti-servo tabs, which would add unacceptable drag. In older jet fighter aircraft, a resisting force was generated within the control system, either by springs or a resisting hydraulic force, rather than by an external anti-servo tab. For example, the North American F-100 Super Sabre, used gearing and a variable stiffness spring attached to the control stick to provide an acceptable resistance to pilot input. In modern fighters, control inputs are processed by computers (&quot;fly by wire&quot;), and there is no direct connection between the pilot&#x27;s stick and the stabilator.

==Airliners==
Most modern airliners do not have a stabilator. Instead they have an adjustable horizontal stabilizer and a separate elevator control. The movable horizontal stabilizer is adjusted to keep the pitch axis in trim during flight as the speed changes, or as fuel is burned and the center of gravity moves. These adjustments are commanded by the autopilot when it is engaged, or by the human pilot if the plane is being flown manually. Adjustable stabilizers are not the same as stabilators: a stabilator is controlled by the pilot&#x27;s control yoke or stick, whereas an adjustable stabilizer is controlled by the trim system.

In the Boeing 737, the adjustable stabilizer trim system is powered by an electrically operated jackscrew.

One example of an airliner with a genuine stabilator used for flight control is the Lockheed L-1011.

<doc id="977209" wikidata="Q2998321" url="?curid=977209" title="Religious cosmology">
<text>Religious cosmology is an explanation of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe from a religious perspective. This may include beliefs on origin in the form of a creation myth, subsequent evolution, current organizational form and nature, and eventual fate or destiny. There are various traditions in religion or religious mythology asserting how and why everything is the way it is and the significance of it all. Religious cosmologies describe the spatial lay-out of the universe in terms of the world in which people typically dwell as well as other dimensions, such as the seven dimensions of religion; these are ritual, experiential and emotional, narrative and mythical, doctrinal, ethical, social, and material.

Religious mythologies may include descriptions of an act or process of creation by a creator deity or a larger pantheon of deities, explanations of the transformation of chaos into order, or the assertion that existence is a matter of endless cyclical transformations. Religious cosmology differs from a strictly scientific cosmology informed by contemporary astronomy, physics, and similar fields, and may differ in conceptualizations of the world&#x27;s physical structure and place in the universe, its creation, and forecasts or predictions on its future.

The scope of religious cosmology is more inclusive than a strictly scientific cosmology (physical cosmology and quantum cosmology) in that religious cosmology is not limited to experiential observation, testing of hypotheses, and proposals of theories; for example, religious cosmology may explain why everything is the way it is or seems to be the way it is and prescribing what humans should do in context. Variations in religious cosmology include Zoroastrian cosmology, those such as from India Buddhism, Hindu, and Jain; the religious beliefs of China, Chinese Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism, Japan&#x27;s Shintoisim and the beliefs of the Abrahamic faiths, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Religious cosmologies have often developed into the formal logics of metaphysical systems, such as Platonism, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Taoism, Kabbalah, Wuxing or the great chain of being.

==Zoroastrian==

In Zoroastrian cosmology, universe is the manifestation of a cosmic conflict between Existence and non-existence, Good and evil and light and darkness which spans over a period of 12000 years. It is subdivided into four equal periods of 3000 years each. The first period is known as Infinite Time. During this period the good and the evil remained in perfect balance in their respective spheres. For 3000 years Ahura Mazda dwelt in the region of light, while his opponent Ahirman or Angra Mainyu, the evil spirit, remained confined to the region of darkness. A great Void separated them both. At the end of the first period, Ahirman crossed the void and attacked Ahura Mazda. Knowing that the battle would continue forever, Ahura Mazda recited Ahuna Vairya, the most sacred hymn of Avesta and repelled him back. Having lost the battle, Angra Mainyu withdrew hastily into his dark world and remained there for another 3000 years. During this interlude, Ahura Mazda brings forth the entire creation. He creates the six Amesha Spentas or the Holy Immortals and several angel spirits or Yazatas. He brought forth the primeval Ox and the primeval man (Gayomart). Then he creates the material creation such as water, air, earth and the metals.

==Biblical cosmology and Abrahamic faiths==

The universe of the ancient Israelites was made up of a flat disc-shaped Earth floating on water, heaven above, underworld below. Humans inhabited Earth during life and the underworld after death, and the underworld was morally neutral; only in Hellenistic times (after c.330 BC) did Jews begin to adopt the Greek idea that it would be a place of punishment for misdeeds, and that the righteous would enjoy an afterlife in heaven. In this period too the older three-level cosmology was widely replaced by the Greek concept of a spherical Earth suspended in space at the centre of a number of concentric heavens. The belief that God created matter from nothing is called &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; (as opposed to &quot;creatio ex materia&quot;). It is the accepted orthodoxy of most denominations of Judaism and Christianity. Most denominations of Christianity and Judaism believe that a single, uncreated God was responsible for the creation of the cosmos.

In his 2023 apostolic exhortation, &quot;Laudate Deum&quot;, Pope Francis outlines several ways in which the human relationship with the created cosmos might be understood:
*the world that surrounds us can be treated as &quot;an object of exploitation, unbridled use and unlimited ambition&quot; or &quot;a mere &#x27;setting&#x27; in which we can develop our lives&quot;;
*the human being is extraneous, a foreign element capable only of harming the environment;
*human beings &quot;are part of nature, included in it and thus in constant interaction with it&quot;. This is the interpretation he supports.

 Islam teaches that God created the universe, including Earth&#x27;s physical environment and human beings. The highest goal is to visualize the cosmos as a book of symbols for meditation and contemplation for spiritual upliftment or as a prison from which the human soul must escape to attain true freedom in the spiritual journey to God.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, like other Indian religions, there is no ultimate beginning nor final end to the universe. It considers all existence as eternal, and believes there is no creator god. Buddhism views the universe as impermanent and always in flux. This cosmology is the foundation of its Samsara theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath. In early Buddhist traditions, &quot;Saṃsāra&quot; cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled. This included hells (&quot;niraya&quot;), hungry ghosts (&quot;pretas&quot;), animals (&quot;tiryak&quot;), humans (&quot;manushya&quot;), and gods (&quot;devas&quot;, heavenly). In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (&quot;asuras&quot;). The &quot;hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms&quot; respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions.

According to Akira Sadakata, the Buddhist cosmology is far more complex and uses extraordinarily larger numbers than those found in Vedic and post-Vedic Hindu traditions. It also shares many ideas and concepts, such as those about Mount Meru. The Buddhist thought holds that the six cosmological realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful karma, or ethical and unethical actions.

===Hindu===

The Hindu cosmology, like the Buddhist and Jain cosmology, considers all existence as cyclic. With its ancient roots, Hindu texts propose and discuss numerous cosmological theories. Hindu culture accepts this diversity in cosmological ideas and has lacked a single mandatory view point even in its oldest known Vedic scriptures, the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Alternate theories include a universe cyclically created and destroyed by god, or goddess, or no creator at all, or a golden egg or womb (Hiranyagarbha), or self-created multitude of universes with enormous lengths and time scales. The Vedic literature includes a number of cosmology speculations, one of which questions the origin of the cosmos and is called the Nasadiya sukta:
Time is conceptualized as a cyclic Yuga with trillions of years. In some models, Mount Meru plays a central role.

Beyond its creation, Hindu cosmology posits divergent theories on the structure of the universe, from being 3 lokas to 12 lokas (worlds) which play a part in its theories about rebirth, samsara and karma.

The complex cosmological speculations found in Hinduism and other Indian religions, states Bolton, is not unique and are also found in Greek, Roman, Irish and Babylonian mythologies, where each age becomes more sinful and of suffering.

===Jain===

Jain cosmology considers the &quot;loka&quot;, or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, having no beginning or an end. Jain texts describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is narrow at the top, broad at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

 of Ācārya Jinasena is famous for this quote:
==Chinese==

There is a &quot;primordial universe&quot; Wuji (philosophy), and Hongjun Laozu, water or qi. It transformed into Taiji then multiplied into everything known as the Wuxing. The Pangu legend tells a formless chaos coalesced into a cosmic egg. Pangu emerged (or woke up) and separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky &quot;Yin&quot;) and the Sky (clear &quot;Yang&quot;). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. After Pangu died, he became everything.

==Gnosticism==
Gnostic teachings were contemporary with those of Neoplatonism. Gnosticism is an imprecise label, covering monistic as well as dualistic conceptions. Usually the higher worlds of Light, called the Pleroma or &quot;fullness&quot;, are radically distinct from the lower world of Matter. The emanation of the Pleroma and its godheads (called &quot;Aeons&quot;) is described in detail in the various Gnostic tracts, as is the pre-creation crisis (a cosmic equivalent to the &quot;fall&quot; in Christian thought) from which the material world comes about, and the way that the divine spark can attain salvation.

==Serer religion==

Serer religion posits that, Roog, the creator deity, is the point of departure and conclusion. As farming people, trees play an important role in Serer religious cosmology and creation mythology. The Serer high priests and priestesses (the Saltigues) chart the star Sirius, known as &quot;Yoonir&quot; in the Serer language and some of the Cangin languages. This star enables them to give accurate information as to when Serer farmers should start planting seeds among other things relevant to Serer lives and Serer country. &quot;Yoonir&quot; is the symbol of the universe in Serer cosmology and creation mythology.

A similar set of beliefs related also to Sirius has been observed among Dogon people of Mali.

<text>The rota or &quot;turn&quot; is a cylinder on a vertical axis, open on one side, that is built inside a wall of a monastery, nunnery or foundling hospital. It was used for exchanging mail and food with cloistered clergy, being their only communication with the world. It is usually about 50 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters high, and its opening does not permit visual or tactile contact with the uncloistered. Messages or food are put into the cylinder, then the &quot;rota&quot; is revolved so that the opening faces the other side. 

Monks were stationed close by, or were notified by various mechanisms that the wheel had been turned. In some cases, especially at night and in winter, the &quot;rota&quot; was filled by the monks with food for the poor, to give them something to eat without them having to ask. The &quot;rota&quot; was also used by mothers giving up their (often illegitimate) newborn babies into the hopefully safe hands of monks or nuns, their anonymity being guaranteed by the &quot;rota&quot;. In some Church dioceses the instrument was abolished to discourage this.

<text>HMS &quot;Kent&quot;, pennant number 54, was a heavy cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the late 1920s. She was the lead ship of the &quot;Kent&quot; subclass. After completion the ship was sent to the China Station where she remained until the beginning of the Second World War, aside from a major refit in 1937–38. &quot;Kent&quot; hunted the German pocket battleship in the East Indies in late 1939 and then was reassigned to troop convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean in early 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in mid-1940, but was torpedoed shortly after arriving. The ship was under repair for a year and was then assigned to Home Fleet where she escorted convoys to and from North Russia for the next several years. In mid-1944 &quot;Kent&quot; escorted British aircraft carriers as their aircraft made attacks on German shipping and airfields in Norway. A few months later she was flagship of a force that intercepted a German convoy in Norwegian waters and sank two freighters and five escorts. The ship was paid off in early 1945 and placed in until she was used as a target. &quot;Kent&quot; was sold for scrap in 1948.

==Description==
&quot;Kent&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving four shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers. &quot;Kent&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 784 officers and men.

The ship mounted eight 50-calibre 8-inch (203 mm) guns in four twin gun turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of four QF Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. &quot;Kent&quot; mounted four single 2-pounder (40 mm) light AA guns (&quot;pom-poms&quot;). The ship carried two quadruple torpedo tube above-water mounts for  torpedoes.

&quot;Kent&quot; was only lightly protected with little more than a single inch of plating protecting vital machinery. Her magazines were the exception and were protected by of armour. Space and weight was reserved for one aircraft catapult and its seaplane, but they were not fitted until after she was completed.

==History==
&quot;Kent&quot; was built by Chatham Dockyard and laid down on 15 November 1924. She was launched on 16 March 1926 and commissioned 25 June 1928. The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron on the China Station and spent the bulk of the interbellum period there. In 1929–30 she received a High-Angle Control System, used to direct her anti-aircraft guns, and an aircraft catapult was also fitted. Her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of two single 4-inch guns the forward funnel in 1932–33.

In January 1934, while serving as the flagship of Admiral Sir Frederick Dreyer, she attended the Far Eastern Naval Conference in Singapore together with &quot;Terror&quot;, &quot;Veteran&quot;, &quot;Wren&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot;. At the conclusion of the conference, Dreyer transferred his flag to the &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Kent&quot; was dispatched to the United Kingdom for a refit. During the 1934 refit two quadruple Vickers .50-calibre (12.7 mm) Mark III machine guns were added.

In 1937, &quot;Kent&quot; returned to Chatham and underwent a major refit, which included a Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms as well as the dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended down from the lower deck. Four inches of armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments. The ship&#x27;s aft director was moved to a pedestal the searchlight tower that replaced the original aft control station. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower. The changes raised the ship&#x27;s displacement by and cost an estimated £161,000. Unlike her sister ships, no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the Washington Naval Treaty limits, but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier Supermarine Walrus flying boat.
In November 1939 she joined with the French heavy cruiser and the Australian destroyers and to hunt for the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; in the East Indies and then was reassigned to escort troop convoys in the Indian Ocean in January 1940.

Following the declaration of war by Italy, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, arriving at Alexandria in August 1940 with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron. On 17 August 1940, &quot;Kent&quot;, the battleships , , and twelve destroyers bombarded Italian positions near Bardia and Fort Capuzzo. Two weeks later the ship participated in Operation Hats, escorting a convoy from Alexandria to Malta.

On 15 September 1940 the battleship , the aircraft carrier , &quot;Kent&quot;, the anti-aircraft cruisers and , and seven destroyers left Alexandria bound for Benghazi. During the night of 16/17 September 1940, aircraft from the &quot;Illustrious&quot; mined the harbour of Benghazi. They also attacked shipping in the harbour with torpedoes and bombs, sinking two destroyers and two merchant ships. &quot;Kent&quot; and two destroyers were detached to bombard Bardia while returning to Alexandria. During the night of 17/18 September 1940 the ship was hit in the stern by a torpedo from Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers from the 279th Independent Torpedo Squadron () led by Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia. She was towed back to base by the destroyers with great difficulty.

&quot;Kent&quot; was given temporary repairs at Alexandria from 19 September to 18 October to allow her to return to the United Kingdom. Extensive repairs at Devonport Dockyard followed from 1 January to 20 September 1941. During this time six Oerlikon 20 mm light AA guns were added and the ship received a variety of radars. These included Type 284 radar for surface gunnery control, Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar, and a Type 281 air warning radar. When her repairs were completed in September 1941, she spent
several months working up. On 8 December &quot;Kent&quot; sailed from Scapa Flow carrying the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, and the Soviet Ambassador to Great Britain, Ivan Maisky. She reached Murmansk on 12 December where the diplomats disembarked to meet with Joseph Stalin. &quot;Kent&quot; sortied on 17 December, with two Soviet destroyers, in a failed attempt to intercept the German 8th Destroyer Flotilla that was engaging two British minesweepers attempting to rendezvous with Convoy PQ 6. The ship brought Eden back home by 29 December.

The cruiser was assigned to the Home Fleet and escorted convoys to and from North Russia. She briefly escorted Convoy QP 8 on the return leg from Russia in March 1942 and provided distant cover for Convoy QP 10 the following month. &quot;Kent&quot; attempted to rendezvous with the damaged light cruiser west of Bear Island as she returned from Murmansk in May, but &quot;Trinidad&quot; was sunk by German aircraft before that could happen. On 21 May the ship joined Convoy PQ 16 as part of the close escort.

After her return from the Soviet Union, the ship was refitted in Liverpool from 18 July to 7 November. Her catapult and quadruple .50-calibre machine guns were removed and six more single 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added. In early January 1943 the cruiser provided cover for Convoy RA 51 and, several weeks later, Convoy JW 52. While on the latter mission, &quot;Kent&quot; was unsuccessfully attacked by the . During a brief refit between 22 September and 4 October at Chatham Dockyard, the ship exchanged six single 20 mm guns for three twin 20 mm gun mounts. In November she provided cover to Convoys RA 54A, JW 54A and JW 54B. The ship covered the outbound Convoys JW 56A, JW 56B and the returning Convoy RA 56 in January–February 1944. The following month &quot;Kent&quot; was part of the covering force for Convoy JW 57.
On 17 July 1944, the ship was formed part of the covering force protecting three British aircraft carriers flying off aircraft to attack the during Operation Mascot. &quot;Kent&quot; escorted three aircraft carriers that attacked the German airfield at Kristiansand on 10 August. She escorted two carriers on 12 September while their aircraft attacked German shipping near Stadlandet. On the night of 13/14 November 1944, as flagship of Rear-Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor during Operation Counterblast, the ship, with the light cruiser and four destroyers, attacked Convoy KS.357 off Listerfjord, south-east of Egersund, Norway. The convoy consisted of four freighters escorted by the minesweepers &quot;M.416&quot;, &quot;M.427&quot; and four submarine chasers. Opening fire at 2300 hrs, the cruisers and destroyers sank two of the freighters and all the escorts above except one unidentified vessel.

With the Naval War in the Atlantic winding down, the ship&#x27;s age and material condition, and a shortage of crews to man her; &quot;Kent&quot; was paid off in January 1945 and remained in reserve for several years until she was used as a target. The ship was struck off the Naval List (the first of the Countys to go) and allocated to BISCO on 22 January 1948 and arrived at Troon on 31 January to be broken up by West of Scotland Shipbreakers.

Footage shot by a crew member in the period 1941-45 was discovered in the archives of the Cinema Museum in London.

<text>Euroborg () is the stadium in Groningen, Netherlands. It is the home ground of football club FC Groningen, with a capacity of 22,525. The stadium site houses a casino, movie theater, school, supermarket, and a fitness centre. A temporary railway station at the stadium opened in late 2007, and a permanent one opened in 2013. The stadium&#x27;s seats are completely clad in the club&#x27;s colors of green and white, with 1,000 seats available for supporters of the away team.

==The stadium==

The stadium was built by a consortium of Ballast Nedam, Royal BAM Group and VolkerWessels and completed in 2006.

The stadium is nicknamed &quot;de Groene Hel&quot; (the Green Hell) and &quot;de Groene Kathedraal&quot; (the Green Cathedral).

The stadium has had several name changes; at the opening in 2006 the stadium was called Euroborg, but in 2016 the name was changed to NoordLease stadion. Due to a fusion of companies, the name was changed to Hitachi Capital Mobility Stadion in 2018. Hitachi Capital Mobility changed their official name in 2021 and they removed their name from the stadium.

==Access==
Euroborg is easy to reach by public transport, as the train station Groningen Europapark, is located 200 meters from the stadium, and is served every hour by several trains and buses. There are also a number of car parks in the surrounding area.

==2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship==
Euroborg was also one of four venues for the 2007 UEFA European U-21 Championship, which the Netherlands hosted. It was host to all group matches of Portugal and the final between the Netherlands and Serbia.

==Netherlands women&#x27;s national football team==
On 24 October 2017, the Netherlands played Norway at Euroborg in front of 20,980 spectators as part of the 2019 Women&#x27;s World Cup qualification. On 23 October 2020, the Netherlands qualified for UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2021 after a victory over Estonia at Euroborg in front of 0 spectators, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="977221" wikidata="Q2671642" url="?curid=977221" title="Trabecula">
<text>A trabecula (: trabeculae, from Latin for &#x27;small beam&#x27;) is a small, often microscopic, tissue element in the form of a small beam, strut or rod that supports or anchors a framework of parts within a body or organ. A trabecula generally has a mechanical function, and is usually composed of dense collagenous tissue (such as the trabecula of the spleen). It can be composed of other material such as muscle and bone. In the heart, muscles form trabeculae carneae and septomarginal trabeculae, and the left atrial appendage has a tubular trabeculated structure. 

Cancellous bone is formed from groupings of trabeculated bone tissue. In cross section, trabeculae of a cancellous bone can look like septa, but in three dimensions they are topologically distinct, with trabeculae being roughly rod or pillar-shaped and septa being sheet-like.

When crossing fluid-filled spaces, trabeculae may offer the function of resisting tension (as in the penis, see for example trabeculae of corpora cavernosa and trabeculae of corpus spongiosum) or providing a cell filter (as in the trabecular meshwork of the eye).

==Bone trabecula==
===Structure===
Trabecular bone, also called cancellous bone, is porous bone composed of trabeculated bone tissue. It can be found at the ends of long bones like the femur, where the bone is actually not solid but is full of holes connected by thin rods and plates of bone tissue. The holes (the volume not directly occupied by bone trabecula) is the &quot;intertrabecular space&quot;, and is occupied by red bone marrow, where all the blood cells are made, as well as fibrous tissue. Even though trabecular bone contains a lot of intertrabecular space, its spatial complexity contributes the maximal strength with minimum mass. It is noted that the form and structure of trabecular bone are organized to optimally resist loads imposed by functional activities, like jumping, running and squatting. And according to Wolff&#x27;s law, proposed in 1892, the external shape and internal architecture of bone are determined by external stresses acting on it. The internal structure of the trabecular bone firstly undergoes adaptive changes along stress direction and then the external shape of cortical bone undergoes secondary changes. Finally bone structure becomes thicker and denser to resist external loading.

Because of the increased occurrence of total joint replacement and its impact on bone remodeling, understanding the stress-related and adaptive process of trabecular bone has become a central concern for bone physiologists. To understand the role of trabecular bone in age-related bone structure and in the design for bone-implant systems, it is important to study the mechanical properties of trabecular bone as a function of variables such as anatomic site, bone density, and age related issues. Mechanical factors including modulus, uniaxial strength, and fatigue properties must be taken into account.

Typically, the porosity percent of trabecular bone is in the range 75–95% and the density ranges from 0.2 to 0.8 g/cm3. It is noted that the porosity can reduce the strength of the bone, but also reduce its weight. The porosity and the manner that porosity is structured affect the strength of material. Thus, the micro structure of trabecular bone is typically oriented and &quot;grain&quot; of porosity is aligned in a direction at which mechanical stiffness and strength are greatest. Because of the microstructural directionality, the mechanical properties of trabecular bone are highly anisotropic. The range of Young&#x27;s modulus for trabecular bone is 800 to 14,000 MPa and the strength of failure is 1 to 100 MPa.

As mentioned above, the mechanical properties of trabecular bone are very sensitive to apparent density. The relationship between modulus of trabecular bone and its apparent density was demonstrated by Carter and Hayes in 1976. The resulting equation states:

formula_1

where formula_2 represents the modulus of trabecular bone in any loading direction, formula_3 represents the apparent density, and formula_4 formula_5 and formula_6 are constants depending on the architecture of tissue.

Using scanning electron microscopy, it was found that the variation in trabecular architecture with different anatomic sites lead to different modulus. To understand structure-anisotropy and material property relations, one must correlate the measured mechanical properties of anisotropic trabecular specimens with the stereological descriptions of their architecture.

The compressive strength of trabecular bone is also very important because it is believed that the inside failure of trabecular bone arise from compressive stress. On the stress-strain curves for both trabecular bone and cortical bone with different apparent density, there are three stages in stress-strain curve. The first is the linear region where individual trabecula bend and compress as the bulk tissue is compressed. The second stage occurs after yielding, where trabecular bonds start to fracture, and the final stage is the stiffening stage. Typically, lower density trabecular areas offer more deformed staging before stiffening than higher density specimens.

In summary, trabecular bone is very compliant and heterogeneous. The heterogeneous character makes it difficult to summarize the general mechanical properties for trabecular bone. High porosity makes trabecular bone compliant and large variations in architecture leads to high heterogeneity. The modulus and strength vary inversely with porosity and are highly dependent on the porosity structure. The effects of aging and small cracking of trabecular bone on its mechanical properties are a source of further study.

===Clinical significance===

Studies have shown that once a human reaches adulthood, bone density steadily decreases with age, to which loss of trabecular bone mass is a partial contributor. Loss of bone mass is defined by the World Health Organization as osteopenia if bone mineral density (BMD) is one standard deviation below mean BMD in young adults, and is defined as osteoporosis if it is more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean. A low bone density greatly increases risk for stress fracture, which can occur without warning. The resulting low-impact fractures from osteoporosis most commonly occur in the upper femur, which consists of 25-50% trabecular bone depending on the region, in the vertebrae, which are about 90% trabecular, or in the wrist.

When trabecular bone volume decreases, its original plate-and-rod structure is disturbed; plate-like structures are converted to rod-like structures and pre-existing rod-like structures thin until they disconnect and resorb into the body. Changes in trabecular bone are typically gender-specific, with the most notable differences in bone mass and trabecular microstructure occurring within the age range for menopause. Trabeculae degradation over time causes a decrease in bone strength that is disproportionately large in comparison to volume of trabecular bone loss, leaving the remaining bone vulnerable to fracture.

With osteoporosis there are often also symptoms of osteoarthritis, which occurs when cartilage in joints is under excessive stress and degrades over time, causing stiffness, pain, and loss of movement. With osteoarthritis, the underlying bone plays a significant role in cartilage degradation. Thus any trabecular degradation can significantly affect stress distribution and adversely affect the cartilage in question.

Due to its strong effect on overall bone strength, there is currently strong speculation that analysis in patterns of trabeculae degradation may be useful in the near future in tracking the progression of osteoporosis.

===Birds===
The hollow design of bird bones is multifunctional. It establishes high specific strength and supplements open airways to accommodate the skeletal pneumaticity common to many birds. The specific strength and resistance to buckling is optimized through a bone design that combines a thin, hard shell that encases a spongy core of trabeculae. The allometry of the trabeculae allows the skeleton to tolerate loads without significantly increasing the bone mass. The red-tailed hawk optimizes its weight with a repeating pattern of V-shaped struts that give the bones the necessary lightweight and stiff characteristics. The inner network of trabeculae shifts mass away from the neutral axis, which ultimately increases the resistance to buckling.

As in humans, the distribution of trabeculae in bird species is uneven and is dependent on load conditions. The bird with the highest density of trabeculae is the kiwi, a flightless bird. There is also uneven distribution of trabeculae within similar species such as the great spotted woodpecker or grey-headed woodpecker. After examining a microCT scan of the woodpecker&#x27;s forehead, temporomandibulum, and occiput it was determined that there is significantly more trabeculae in the forehead and occiput. Besides the difference in distribution, the aspect ratio of the individual struts was higher in woodpeckers than in other birds of similar size such as the Eurasian hoopoe or the lark. The woodpeckers&#x27; trabeculae are more plate-like while the hawk and lark have rod-like structures networked through their bones. The decrease in strain on the woodpecker&#x27;s brain has been attributed to the higher quantity of thicker plate-like struts packed more closely together than the hawk or hoopoe or the lark. Conversely, the thinner rod-like structures would lead to greater deformation. A destructive mechanical test with 12 samples show the woodpecker&#x27;s trabeculae design has an average ultimate strength of 6.38MPa, compared to the lark&#x27;s 0.55MPa.

Woodpeckers&#x27; beaks have tiny struts supporting the shell of the beak, but to a lesser extent compared to the skull. As a result of fewer trabeculae in the beak, the beak has a higher stiffness (1.0 GPa) compared to the skull (0.31 GPa). While the beak absorbs some of the impact from pecking, most of the impact is transferred to the skull where more trabeculae are actively available to absorb the shock. The ultimate strength of woodpeckers&#x27; and larks&#x27; beaks are similar, inferring the beak has a lesser role in impact absorption. One measured advantage of the woodpecker&#x27;s beak is the slight overbite (upper beak is 1.6mm longer than lower beak) which offers a bimodal distribution of force due to the asymmetric surface contact. The staggered timing of impact induces a lower strain on the trabeculae in the forehead, occiput, and beak.

=== Trabecula in other organisms ===

The larger the animal, the higher the load forces on its bones. Trabecular bone increases stiffness by increasing the amount of bone per unit volume or by altering the geometry and arrangement of individual trabeculae as body size and bone loading increases. Trabecular bone scales allometrically, reorganizing the bones&#x27; internal structure to increase the ability of the skeleton to sustain loads experienced by the trabeculae. Furthermore, scaling of trabecular geometry can moderate trabecular strain. Load acts as a stimulus to the trabecular, changing its geometry so as to sustain or mitigate strain loads. By using finite element modelling, a study tested four different species under an equal apparent stress (σapp) to show that trabecular scaling in animals alters the strain within the trabecular. It was observed that the strain within trabeculae from each species varied with the geometry of the trabeculae. From a scale of tens of micrometers, which is approximately the size of osteocytes, the figure below shows that thicker trabeculae exhibited less strain. The relative frequency distributions of element strain experienced by each species shows a higher elastic moduli of the trabeculae as the species size increases.

Additionally, trabeculae in larger animals are thicker, further apart, and less densely connected than those in smaller animals. Intra-trabecular osteon can commonly be found in thick trabeculae of larger animals, as well as thinner trabeculae of smaller animals such as cheetah and lemurs. The osteons play a role in the diffusion of nutrients and waste products of osteocytes by regulating the distance between osteocytes and bone surface to approximately 230 μm.

Due to an increased reduction of blood oxygen saturation, animals with high metabolic demands tend to have a lower trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) because they require increased vascular perfusion of trabeculae. The vascularization by tunneling osteons changes the trabecular geometry from solid to tube-like, increasing bending stiffness for individual trabeculae and sustaining blood supply to deep tissue osteocytes.

Bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was found to be relatively constant for the variety of animal sizes tested. Larger animals did not show a significantly larger mass per unit volume of trabecular bone. This may be due to an adaptation which reduces the physiological cost of producing, maintaining, and moving tissue. However, BV/TV showed significant positive scaling in avian femoral condyles. Larger birds present decreased flight habits due to avian BV/TV allometry. The flightless kiwi, weighing only 1–2 kg, had the greatest BV/TV of the birds tested in the study. This shows that trabecular bone geometry is related to ‘prevailing mechanical conditions’, so the differences in trabecular geometry in the femoral head and condyle could be attributed to different loading environments of coxofemoral and femorotibial joints.

The woodpecker&#x27;s ability to resist repetitive head impact is correlated with its unique micro/nano-hierarchical composite structures. Microstructure and nanostructure of the woodpecker&#x27;s skull consists of an uneven distribution of spongy bone, the organizational shape of individual trabeculae. This affects the woodpecker&#x27;s mechanical properties, allowing the cranial bone to withstand a high ultimate strength (σu). Compared to the cranial bone of the lark, the woodpecker&#x27;s cranial bone is denser and less spongy, having a more plate-like structure rather than the more rod-like structure observed in larks. Furthermore, the woodpecker&#x27;s cranial bone is thicker and more individual trabeculae. Relative to the trabeculae in lark, the woodpecker&#x27;s trabecular is more closely spaced and more plate-like. [19] These properties result in higher ultimate strength in the cranial bone of the woodpecker.

==History==
The diminutive form of Latin &quot;trabs&quot;, means a beam or bar. In the 19th century, the neologism &quot;trabeculum&quot; (with an assumed plural of &quot;trabecula&quot;) became popular, but is less etymologically correct. &quot;Trabeculum&quot; persists in some countries as a synonym for the trabecular meshwork of the eye, but this can be considered poor usage on the grounds of both etymology and descriptive accuracy.

<text>A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed; they are partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be &quot;in mothballs&quot; or &quot;mothballed&quot;. In earlier times, especially in British usage, the ships were said to be &quot;laid up in ordinary&quot;.

A reserve fleet may be colloquially referred to as a &quot;ghost fleet&quot;. In the 21st century, ghost fleet may also refer to an active [[shadow fleet]] of aged reserve fleet oil tankers returned to an active service in order to circumvent commodities sanctions.

==Overview==
Such ships are held in reserve against a time when it may be necessary to call them back into service. They are usually tied up in backwater areas near naval bases or shipyards in order to speed the reactivation process. They may be modified for storage during such a period, for instance by having rust-prone areas sealed off or wrapped in plastic or, in the case of sailing warships, the masts removed. While being held in the reserve fleet, ships typically have a minimal crew (known informally as a skeleton crew) to ensure that they stay in somewhat usable condition. For instance, bilge pumps need to be run regularly to reduce corrosion of their steel and to prevent the ships from foundering at their moorings.

When a ship is placed into reserve status, the various parts and weapon systems that the ship uses are also placed in a storage facility, so that if the warship is reactivated, the proper spare parts and ammunition are available. Like the ships, however, the stored parts and equipment are prone to fall into disrepair, suffer metal corrosion, and become obsolete.

==Principal reserve fleets==
The British Reserve Fleet was a repository for British decommissioned warships from about 1800 until 1960.

The United States National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), consisted of about fifty World War II ships that were moored in Suisun Bay (Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet) near San Francisco since the 1950s or &#x27;60s. The fleet included military cargo ships, troopships and tankers. As of mid-2021 there are just two ships anchored in that area. Additional NDRF vessels are moored at the fleet sites at Newport News, Virginia (James River Reserve Fleet); Beaumont, Texas (Beaumont Reserve Fleet); and at designated outported berths.

==Alternatives==
In practice most reserve ships rapidly become obsolete and are scrapped, used for experiments, target practice, sold to other nations (and occasionally to private companies for civilian conversion), become museum ships or artificial reefs.

Alternatives to reserve fleets include exporting the vessels for shipbreaking, or dismantling. More recently, the U.S. Navy has established a program to allow ships, such as &quot;Oriskany&quot;, to be sunk in selected locations to create artificial reefs.

Recycling is another option, as in the case of the United States National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF), the ships of which are set to be stripped of their paint, cut into pieces, and then recycled.

Steel from pre-nuclear age ships either mothballed or sunk and raised, called low-background steel, is used in experimental physics when the experiment requires shielding material which is itself only extremely weakly radioactive, emitting less than present-day background radiation; materials which were manufactured after atmospheric nuclear explosions had taken place reflect the higher ambient level of radioactivity that fallout has caused.

==Environmental concerns==
The practice of exporting and dismantling ships has caused international protests as they contain toxic materials. In 2007, following studies that found that 20 tons of lead paint had flaked off the ships of the NDRF, environmentalist groups sued to have them removed. The U.S. Federal Maritime Administration agreed to remove more than 50 of the ships as a result, 25 of which have been removed by 2012 and the remainder removed at the end of 2017.

In part due to his relative youth at the time he won the 1978 WSoP bracelet (aged 28), Baldwin has the earliest Main Event victory of any poker player alive.

Baldwin was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and attended Oklahoma State University in 1970. He currently resides in Las Vegas.

==Poker career==
Baldwin won his first two bracelets at the 1977 World Series of Poker, first winning the $10,000 Deuce to Seven Draw event, then winning the $5,000 Seven-Card Stud event.

Baldwin won his largest tournament prize in 1978 when he won the WSOP Main Event, earning the title and the $210,000 first prize. He defeated a final table that included professional poker players Ken Smith, Jesse Alto, Buck Buchanan, WSOP bracelet winner Louis Sager Hunsucker Jr., and businessman Crandell Addington, whom Baldwin defeated in heads-up play.

When Baldwin won the 1978 World Series of Poker Main Event at age 28, he became the youngest winner in its history. His title of youngest winner was superseded by Stu Ungar in 1980.

In 1979, he won the $10,000 Deuce to Seven Draw event again, earning his fourth and most recent bracelet at the WSOP. Baldwin also competed in the Super Bowl of Poker tournaments, organized by 1972 world champion Amarillo Slim. Baldwin cashed in several SBOP events and won the $5,000 Seven Card Stud event in 1979.

His major wins include four WSOP bracelets, all won from 1977 to 1979. He won WSOP bracelets in three consecutive years (1977, 1978, and 1979) which only a small number of players have done in the history of the WSOP. In addition to his 1978 victory, Baldwin&#x27;s other WSOP Main Event cashes are: 1981 (7th), 1986 (16th), 1987 (21st), 1991 (29th), 1992 (15th), 1994 (24th), and 2009 (352nd).

In 2003, Baldwin was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.

He cashed in the 2012 World Series of Poker in the Big One for One Drop, finishing seventh.

== Career as casino executive ==
In 1982, Baldwin became a consultant for the Golden Nugget casino, and in 1984 was named the president. He was selected to head The Mirage in 1987, and was named as the president of the Bellagio hotel and casino in 1998.

In 1999–2000, Baldwin was the chief financial officer of Mirage Resorts under Steve Wynn; in 2000, upon the merger of Mirage Resorts and MGM Grand, he became the chief executive officer of the Mirage Resorts subsidiary of MGM Mirage.

In 2005, after the acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group by MGM Mirage, Baldwin became CEO and President of the announced Project City Center, while continuing his responsibilities as CEO of the Mirage Resorts subsidiary. Baldwin now oversees additional resorts added through the Mandalay Resort Group buyout as well as the previous Wynn properties.

In 2018, following a lengthy tenure as Chief Customer Development Officer of MGM Resorts and CEO and President of CityCenter, MGM announced that Baldwin would leave both positions by the end of 2018.

== Other interests ==
In addition to poker, Baldwin is also known as a world-class billiards player. Baldwin and his playing style are the subject of a book entitled &quot;Bobby Baldwin&#x27;s Winning Poker Secrets&quot;, which was written by Mike Caro. Baldwin has written many columns on poker and he authored a section for Doyle Brunson&#x27;s Super/System. His own book &quot;Tales Out of Tulsa&quot;, a poker guide for novices, was published in 1985.

The high-stakes signature poker room in the Bellagio is named &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Room&quot; after Baldwin.

As of 2012, his total live tournament winnings exceed $2,300,000. His 20 cashes at the WSOP account for $2,100,311 of those winnings.

<text>Jan Sariusz Zamoyski (; 19 March 1542 – 3 June 1605) was a Polish nobleman, magnate, statesman and the 1st &quot;ordynat&quot; of Zamość. He served as the Royal Secretary from 1565, Deputy Chancellor from 1576, Grand Chancellor of the Crown from 1578, and Great Hetman of the Crown from 1581.

Zamoyski was the General Starost of the city of Kraków from 1580 to 1585, Starost of Bełz, Międzyrzecz, Krzeszów, Knyszyn and Tartu. An important advisor to Kings Sigismund II Augustus and Stephen Báthory, he was one of the major opponents of Bathory&#x27;s successor, Sigismund III Vasa, and one of the most skilled diplomats, politicians and statesmen of his time, standing as a major figure in the politics of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth throughout his life.

==Biography==
===Childhood and education===
Jan Zamoyski was born on 19 March 1542 to Stanisław Zamoyski and Anna Herburt in Skokówka. He started his education in a school in Krasnystaw but when he was thirteen years old he was sent to study abroad; from 1555 to 1559 he was a page at the royal court in Paris. Already at this young age he attended lectures at the Sorbonne University and Collège de France. In 1559 he briefly visited Poland, then attended the University of Strasbourg; after a few months there he moved to University of Padua, where from 1561 he studied law and received a doctorate in 1564. During his years abroad he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism.

During his education, he became active in university politics, and in 1563 he was elected the rector of the law department. Around that time he also wrote &quot;De senatu Romano&quot;, a brochure about Ancient Rome government. He returned to the Commonwealth in 1565, and was the first person to receive a commendation letter from the senate of the Republic of Venice.

===Early career===
After returning to Poland, he was appointed to the Royal Chancellery, and soon became a favorite secretary to King Sigismund II. In 1567 he commanded a royal task force, sent to remove the noble family of Starzechowscy from the royal lands they were decreed to hold illegally. Another major task he completed at that time was the reorganization of the Chancellery archive.

In 1571 he married Anna Ossolińska; his wife and their young son died shortly afterwards, in 1572. After the extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty in 1572 during the election sejm (special session of the Commonwealth parliament) he used his influence to enforce the &quot;viritim election&quot; (meaning all nobles had the right to vote for the new king during the upcoming 1573 Polish–Lithuanian royal election). However, his proposal for majority voting did not pass, which opened the process for abuses of &quot;liberum veto&quot; in the future. He was a colleague of Mikołaj Sienicki and Hieronim Ossolinski, and with them he was one of the leaders of a faction of the lesser and middle nobility (szlachta) in the Commonwealth, whose goal was the reform the country – the execution movement – preserving the unique constitutional and parliamentary government of the Commonwealth with the dominant role of poorer nobility (Golden Freedom). He was so influential and popular among the lesser nobility that he was known as the &quot;first tribune of nobility&quot; or &quot;Polish Gracchus.&quot;

===Chancellor and Hetman ===

In that first election he was in favour of Henry de Valois (later, Henry III of France). Subsequently, he was part of the diplomatic mission that traveled to France to finish formalities with the newly elected king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henry secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti-Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which ended up in the marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti-Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania.

Bathory thanked Zamoyski by granting him the office of Deputy Chancellor on 16 May 1576. He participated on Batory&#x27;s side in the quelling of the Danzig rebellion in 1576–1577, sponsoring a chorągiew of pancerni (cavalry unit) and participating in close combat on several occasions. In 1577 he married again, this time marrying Krystyna Radziwiłł, daughter of magnate Mikołaj Radziwiłł Czarny; this made him a close ally of the Radziwiłł family, the most powerful family in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1578 he received the post of the Grand Crown Chancellor. That year poet Jan Kochanowski dedicated his &quot;Odprawa Posłów Greckich&quot;, the first Polish tragedy, to him.

He took part in the preparation for a war against Muscovy in 1579–1581, where he contributed a group of 400 or 600 mercenaries. Through he had little prior military background nor experience, he was interested in mastering the military art, and proved to be an adept learner. With Batory&#x27;s support, he began filling in for some of the roles of Grand Crown Hetman Mikołaj Mielecki, particularly when Mielecki was not present. While not campaigning, he was also instrumental in ensuring that the ongoing political support for the war continued. In 1580 he was hit by another personal tragedy, as his wife died in labor, together with their child; entering a short period of depression.

Later that year, in August, he captured Velizh in September he participated in the siege of Velikiye Luki, and then took Zavoloc. On 11 August 1581 he received the nomination for the post of Grand Crown Hetman; this nomination, although uncontroversial at that time, was technically illegal. Following that he participated in the long and inconclusive Siege of Pskov, which ended with the Peace of Yam-Zapolsky in 1582. Though Zamoyski failed to capture Pskov, he drained the Russian resources, and the ongoing siege was a major reason for the final treaty, which was highly favorable to Poland.

In June 1583 Zamoyski took his third wife, Gryzelda Bathory, a relative of king Bathory himself. In May 1584 Zamoyski&#x27;s men captured Samuel Zborowski, a noble whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade; shortly afterwards with Bathory&#x27;s consent Zborowski was executed. This political conflict between Báthory, Zamoyski and the Zborowski family, framed as a clash between the monarch and the nobility, would be a major recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years, beginning with a major dispute at the Sejm of 1585.

===Later years===

After Báthory&#x27;s death in 1586, Zamoyski helped Sigismund III Vasa gain the Polish throne, fighting in the brief civil war against the forces supporting Habsburg archduke Maximilian III of Austria. The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian was supported by the Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Kraków and defeated Maximilian&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which Sławomir Leśniewski describes as &quot;one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski&#x27;s military career&quot;, Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and Będzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown. Later that year Zamoyski proposed a reform of the royal elections, which failed to pass the Sejm. Zamoyski presented to this Sejm a project that in case the present King should die without issue none but a candidate of some Slav stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne. This was a project which could even imagine the possibility of some kind of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy and semi-Protestant Bohemia. In fact, it was a circuitous and clumsy counter-proposal against pro-Habsburg policy.

From 1589 Zamoyski, in his role as the hetman, tried to prevent the intensifying Tatar incursions along the Commonwealth&#x27;s south-eastern border, but with little success. In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a buffer zone between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire; this would lead to a lengthy campaign.

===In opposition to the throne===

Meanwhile, in internal Commonwealth politics, early on in Sigismund III&#x27;s reign, Zamoyski, who was once a staunch supporter of the Commonwealth kings, begun to distance himself from the King. Sigismund had quickly allied himself with the Habsburgs, much to chancellors dissatisfaction. Zamoyski was dissatisfied with Sigismund&#x27;s early plans to use Poland as a stepping stone to gaining the Swedish crown, as Sigismund was plotting to cede the Polish crown to the Habsburgs in exchange for their support of his right to the Swedish throne. The new King feared the chancellor&#x27;s power, but due to Commonwealth laws he was unable to dismiss him from his posts. He offered him a prestigious voivode of Kraków office, but Zamoyski declined, as if he was to accept, the law would require him to resign from his slightly less prestigious but more influential chancellorship. By 1590–1591 Zamoyski was seen as one of the king&#x27;s staunchest opponents. Open quarrel between king and chancellor broke out during the Sejm of 1591, culminating in a heated exchange of words and the king storming out of the chamber. Despite their tensed relations, neither the king nor the chancellor wanted a civil war; soon after their quarrel Zamoyski would issue a public apology to the king and their uneasy relationship would continue until Zamoyski&#x27;s death.

In 1594 Zamoyski once again failed to stop a Tatar incursion in the southern borders. The next year was much more successful, as in Moldavia in 1595 he was victorious in the Battle of Cecora, and helped hospodar Ieremia Movilă (Jeremi Mohyła) gain the throne. In 1600 he fought against Michael the Brave (Michał Waleczny, Mihai Viteazul), hospodar of Wallachia and the new Prince of Transylvania, who had conquered Moldavia a few months earlier. He defeated him on the Bukova (Bucovu) and restored Ieremia to the throne. He also helped his brother, Simion Movilă to become brief ruler of Wallachia, thus spreading the influence of the Commonwealth to the Central Danube.

In 1600 and 1601 Zamoyski took part in the war against Sweden commanding the Commonwealth forces in Livonia (Inflanty). At the same time he was a vocal opponent of that war on the political scene. In 1600 he recaptured several strongholds from the Swedes and a year later captured Wolmar on 19 December 1601 Fellin on 16 May 1602, and Bialy Kamien on 30 September 1602. The rigours of the campaign, however, placed a strain on his health, and he resigned the command.

At the Sejm of 1603 Zamoyski led opposition to the governance reforms proposed by Sigismund; seeing in them intentions of transforming the Commonwealth into an absolute monarchy. Later, he also opposed Sigismund&#x27;s plans to intervene in the civil war plaguing Muscovy (the Time of Troubles and the Dymitriads). He clashed with Sigismund for the final time during the Sejm of January 1605.

Zamoyski died suddenly on 3 June 1605, due to a stroke. His fortune was inherited by his single son, Tomasz Zamoyski.

==Assessment and legacy==

===Remembrance===

The fame of Zamoyski, significance in life, endured after his death. He was praised by artists such as Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and historians, including Stanisław Staszic, Stanisław Tarnowski and Artur Śliwiński. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Kołłątaj, Józef Szujski, Michał Bobrzyński. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski&#x27;s posthumous career was even more magnificent than his real one. Leśniewski, ending his recent biography of Zamoyski, concludes that he is a significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance.

Zamoyski was the subject of several paintings and drawings. Most notably, he is one of the characters in two large paintings by Jan Matejko, featured on the &quot;Skarga&#x27;s Sermon&quot; and &quot;Batory at Pskov&quot;.

===Political and military leader===
Having control of both the Chancellorship and the Grand Hetman office, Zamoyski was one of the most powerful people in the country, having obtained both the power of Grand Hetman (commander in chief of the armed forces) and that of chancellor, combined for the first time in the hands of one person. He was responsible for much of the Polish internal and foreign policies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history.

Even though his military career begun almost as an afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered as one of the most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.

===Wealth and cultural patronage===
Zamoyski gathered a significant fortune; his estates generated a revenue of over 200,000 zlotys in the early 17th century. His personal lands covered , and included eleven towns and over 200 villages. He was a royal caretaker of another dozen or so cities and over 600 villages. Totaled, his personal and leased lands covered over , with 23 towns and cities and 816 villages. In 1589 he succeeded in establishing the Zamoyski Family Fee Tail (&quot;ordynacja zamojska&quot;), a &quot;de facto&quot; duchy. Zamoyski supported economical development of his lands, investing in colonization of frontiers, and the development of industry, both small (sawmills, breweries, mills and such) and large (his lands had four iron mills and four glass factories).

His most prized creation was the capital of his Fee Tail, the city of Zamość, founded in 1580, built and designed as a Renaissance &quot;&quot; or &quot;ideal city&quot; by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando. In the city, in 1595 he founded the Akademia Zamojska, the third university in the history of education in Poland. In addition to Zamość, he also funded four other towns: Szarogród, Skinderpol, Busza and Jasnogród.

Zamoyski collected a significant library, and was a patron of numerous artists in his Fee Tail. Artists under his patronage included the poets Jan Kochanowski and Szymon Szymonowic, and the writer and historian Joachim Bielski.

===Personality===
Zamoyski was not a deeply religious person, and his conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism was primarily pragmatic. Leśniewski notes that Zamoyski was often motivated by greed, for example during the Danzig Rebellion, when he supported lenient treatment of the rebels, and during the 1577–1578 negotiations with, when he favored the solution of George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach; in both cases his decision was likely influenced by bribes or favors. In another example, Leśniewski describes how Zamoyski openly demanded rewards following his victory at Byczyna, and tried to include an article favoring him in the Bytom and Będzin treaty. He further notes, critically, that with raising power and political success Zamoyski begun displaying negative qualities, such as egoism and arrogance. Zamoyski was ruthless to those weaker than him. At the same time, he was respected by his opponents, widely recognized as highly intelligent, a cunning strategist and tactician in matters political and military, and a popular political leader. He valued the good of the country at least as high as his own, and although he could have become the king after a victorious civil war against Sigismund, he preferred to act within the limits of law instead, avoiding a war that could devastate the country, and thus curbing his own ambitions.

<text>The Max Planck Medal is the highest award of the German Physical Society , the world&#x27;s largest organization of physicists, for extraordinary achievements in theoretical physics. The prize has been awarded annually since 1929, with few exceptions, and usually to a single person. The winner is awarded with a gold medal and hand-written parchment.

In 1943 it was not possible to manufacture the gold medal because the Berlin foundry was hit by a bomb. The board of directors of the German Physical Society decided to manufacture the medals in a substitute metal and to deliver the gold medals later.

The highest award of the German Physical Society for outstanding results in experimental physics is the Stern–Gerlach Medal.

<doc id="977244" wikidata="Q898422" url="?curid=977244" title="Substituent">
<text>In organic chemistry, a substituent is one or a group of atoms that replaces (one or more) atoms, thereby becoming a moiety in the resultant (new) molecule. (In organic chemistry and biochemistry, the terms &quot;substituent&quot; and &quot;functional group&quot;, as well as &quot;side chain&quot; and &quot;pendant group&quot;, are used almost interchangeably to describe those branches from the parent structure, though certain distinctions are made in polymer chemistry. In polymers, side chains extend from the backbone structure. In proteins, side chains are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone.)

The suffix &quot;-yl&quot; is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen; &quot;-ylidene&quot; and &quot;-ylidyne&quot; are used with double bonds and triple bonds, respectively. In addition, when naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent, positional numbers are used to indicate which carbon atom the substituent attaches to when such information is needed to distinguish between isomers. Substituents can be a combination of the inductive effect and the mesomeric effect. Such effects are also described as electron-rich and electron withdrawing. Additional steric effects result from the volume occupied by a substituent.

The phrases &quot;most-substituted&quot; and &quot;least-substituted&quot; are frequently used to describe or compare molecules that are products of a chemical reaction. In this terminology, methane is used as a reference of comparison. Using methane as a reference, for each hydrogen atom that is replaced or &quot;substituted&quot; by something else, the molecule can be said to be more highly substituted. For example:
* Markovnikov&#x27;s rule predicts that the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon of the alkene functional group which has the greater number of hydrogen atoms (fewer alkyl substituents).
* Zaitsev&#x27;s rule predicts that the major reaction product is the alkene with the more highly substituted (more stable) double bond.

== Nomenclature ==
The suffix &quot;-yl&quot; is used in organic chemistry to form names of radicals, either separate species (called &quot;free radicals&quot;) or chemically bonded parts of molecules (called &quot;moieties&quot;). It can be traced back to the old name of methanol, &quot;methylene&quot; (from &#x27;, &#x27;wine&#x27; and &#x27;, &#x27;wood&#x27;, &#x27;forest&#x27;), which became shortened to &quot;methyl&quot; in compound names, from which &quot;-yl&quot; was extracted. Several reforms of chemical nomenclature eventually generalized the use of the suffix to other organic substituents. 

The use of the suffix is determined by the number of hydrogen atoms that the substituent replaces on a parent compound (and also, usually, on the substituent). According to the 1993 IUPAC recommendations:
* &quot;-yl&quot; means that one hydrogen is replaced.
* &quot;-ylidene&quot; means that two hydrogens are replaced by a double bond between parent and substituent.
* -&quot;ylidyne&quot; means that three hydrogens are replaced by a triple bond between parent and substituent.

The suffix &quot;-ylidine&quot; is encountered sporadically, and appears to be a variant spelling of &quot;-ylidene&quot;; it is not mentioned in the IUPAC guidelines.

For multiple bonds of the same type, which link the substituent to the parent group, the infixes &quot;-di-&quot;, &quot;-tri-&quot;, &quot;-tetra-&quot;, etc., are used: &quot;-diyl&quot; (two single bonds), &quot;-triyl&quot; (three single bonds), &quot;-tetrayl&quot; (four single bonds), &quot;-diylidene&quot; (two double bonds).

For multiple bonds of different types, multiple suffixes are concatenated: -&quot;ylylidene&quot; (one single and one double), &quot;-ylylidyne&quot; (one single and one triple), &quot;-diylylidene&quot; (two single and one double).

The parent compound name can be altered in two ways: 
* For many common compounds the substituent is linked at one end (the 1 position) and historically not numbered in the name. The IUPAC 2013 Rules however &quot;do&quot; require an explicit locant for most substituents in a preferred IUPAC name. The substituent name is modified by stripping &quot;-ane&quot; (see alkane) and adding the appropriate suffix. This is &quot;recommended only for saturated acyclic and monocyclic hydrocarbon substituent groups and for the mononuclear parent hydrides of silicon, germanium, tin, lead, and boron&quot;. Thus, if there is a carboxylic acid called &quot;&quot;X&quot;-ic acid&quot;, an alcohol ending &quot;&quot;X&quot;-anol&quot; (or &quot;&quot;X&quot;-yl alcohol&quot;), or an alkane called &quot;&quot;X&quot;-ane&quot;, then &quot;&quot;X&quot;-yl&quot; typically denotes the same carbon chain lacking these groups but modified by attachment to some other parent molecule.
* The more general method omits only the terminal &quot;e&quot; of the substituent name, but requires explicit numbering of each &quot;yl&quot; prefix, even at position 1 (except for -ylidyne, which as a triple bond must terminate the substituent carbon chain). &quot;Pentan-1-yl&quot; is an example of a name by this method, and is synonymous with &quot;pentyl&quot; from the previous guideline.

Note that some popular terms such as &quot;vinyl&quot; (when used to mean &quot;polyvinyl&quot;) represent only a portion of the full chemical name. 

==Methane substituents==
According to the above rules, a carbon atom in a molecule, considered as a substituent, has the following names depending on the number of hydrogens bound to it, and the type of bonds formed with the remainder of the molecule:
== Notation ==

In a chemical structural formula, an organic substituent such as methyl, ethyl, or aryl can be written as &quot;R&quot; (or R1, R2, etc.) It is a generic placeholder, the &quot;R&quot; derived from &quot;radical&quot; or &quot;rest&quot;, which may replace any portion of the formula as the author finds convenient. The first to use this symbol was Charles Frédéric Gerhardt in 1844.

The symbol &quot;X&quot; is often used to denote electronegative substituents such as the halides.

== Statistical distribution ==
One cheminformatics study identified 849,574 unique substituents up to 12 non-hydrogen atoms large and containing only carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, selenium, and the halogens in a set of 3,043,941 molecules. Fifty substituents can be considered common as they are found in more than 1% of this set, and 438 are found in more than 0.1%. 64% of the substituents are found in only one molecule. The top 5 most common are the methyl, phenyl, chlorine, methoxy, and hydroxyl substituents. The total number of organic substituents in organic chemistry is estimated at 3.1 million, creating a total of 6.7×1023 molecules. An infinite number of substituents can be obtained simply by increasing carbon chain length. For instance, the substituents methyl (-CH3) and pentyl (-C5H11).

<text>Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With (stylized in lowercase) is the third EP by prog rock band King Crimson released in 2002, a companion to the subsequent album &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; (2003). Many of the songs on &quot;Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With&quot; can also be found on &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;, but there are differences between recordings; this version of &quot;Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With&quot; is longer by one chorus, and &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; uses primarily acoustic instrumentation.

<doc id="977266" wikidata="Q3266754" url="?curid=977266" title="D20 Modern">
<text>d20 Modern is a modern fantasy role-playing game system designed by Bill Slavicsek, Jeff Grubb, Rich Redman, and Charles Ryan. The system&#x27;s core rulebook was published by Wizards of the Coast on November 1, 2002; by 2006, ten additional supplements were released. The game is based on the d20 System and the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd Edition ruleset. It includes various campaign settings along with the tools to build campaigns in modern/contemporary settings.

==History==
Wizards released &quot;d20 Modern&quot; in 2002 while the company was overhauling its &quot;Star Wars&quot; role-playing game. Wizards then expanded on the game, developing one of its settings into a sourcebook, the &quot;Urban Arcana Campaign Setting&quot; (2003). Wizards then extended this development of d20 even further, with the science-fiction game &quot;d20 Future&quot; (2004) as well as the historical game &quot;d20 Past&quot; (2005). Wizards ended this line in 2006 by updating their classic campaign setting &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; for &quot;d20 Modern&quot;.

== Alterations to the d20 System ==

=== Basic classes ===
In &quot;d20 Modern&quot;, each character is referred to as a hero. All heroes start with a first-level, basic class. Each basic class corresponds to one of the six ability scores in the d20 System. Each basic class has its own set of skills, feats, talents, saves, hit dice, wealth bonus, and so on. A beginning basic hero will become a more specific advanced-class hero at later levels, depending on which abilities a player favors for their character.

The six basic classes are:
* The Strong Hero, based on Strength (STR). These heroes are brawny, and they greatly favor melee combat.
* The Fast Hero, based on Dexterity (DEX). Nimble, quick, and able to evade most incoming attacks.
* The Tough Hero, based on Constitution (CON). Difficult to take down and can resist most sicknesses.
* The Smart Hero, based on Intelligence (INT). A know-it-all hero with an edge in brain-intensive skills.
* The Dedicated Hero, based on Wisdom (WIS). A highly intuitive and vigilant hero.
* The Charismatic Hero, based on Charisma (CHA). A hero with personal magnetism and a way with words.

=== Advanced Classes ===
In addition to basic classes, there are also advanced classes. Similar to basic classes but with requirements to fulfill. There are 14 advanced classes for which a player character may qualify over time:

Advanced classes can be less or more easily achieved depending on the hero&#x27;s basic class. For instance, a Tough Hero can be an excellent candidate for Bodyguard or Daredevil, but would have more difficulty becoming a Techie or Acolyte.

At later levels, the player may choose to multi-class their hero; for example, a Strong and Dedicated Bodyguard (two basic classes, one advanced), or a Smart Investigator and Field Scientist (one basic, two advanced). There are no limitations in the rule set as to how many classes a hero may have, but two or three are typical. Dividing experience and character development between too many classes results in breadth at the cost of having weaker abilities in each class.

Some gamemasters (GMs) may set restrictions on certain advanced classes in their campaign. E.g., the advanced classes might require more experience points to acquire, or some might not be available until specific objectives have been reached in the game campaign. GMs may also entirely rule out certain classes, e.g. Acolyte and Mage because their spell-casting abilities do not fit the GM&#x27;s hard sci-fi scenario.

=== Action Points ===
One of the interesting additions to the system was the action points. Actions points are used by characters to affect game play greatly. Whenever a character spends one action point, the character receives a small boost in his or her skill checks, ability checks, level checks, or saving throws. There&#x27;s a bit of restriction when and where to use them. As the character spends these points, they&#x27;re very limited. However, through level advancement, he or she replenishes spent action points.

=== Feats, Skills, and Items ===
In order to fit the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; setting, some skills and items are reworded and rebalanced, and both the feats and skills mechanics receive expansions.

Also included are game statistics for both modern weapons and &quot;archaic&quot; weapons, such as swords, axes, and crossbows.

=== Occupations and Wealth Bonus ===
Occupations aren&#x27;t considered classes but act as a job or career that a character holds. He or she may hold multiple occupations, but over time. There are over 19 different occupations and each with its own restrictions, such as age. As well, they open more options when choosing skills and higher Wealth bonus. The 19 occupations are: Academic, Adventurer, Athlete, Blue Collar, Celebrity, Creative, Criminal, Dilettante, Doctor, Emergency Services, Entrepreneur, Investigative, Law Enforcement, Military, Religious, Rural, Student, Technician, and White Collar.

Instead of using real world currency, such as United States dollar (USD) or Euro (EUR), it’s been replaced with the Wealth bonus. It functions just like any real world currency: income, credit, debit, to deposit or withdraw, purchasing and selling, and so on. It also defines the characters&#x27; financial conditions, from being opulent to impoverishment. All characters have their own wealth. Determining wealth at first level, the player rolls a four-sided die two times (2d4), and then adds the results together. The result can be increased by occupation, the Windfall feat, and the Profession skill. Whenever the character advances in level, the player rolls a Profession check.

== Campaign settings ==

&quot;d20 Modern&quot; presents three sample campaign settings. These settings, unlike the rest of the book, feature the supernatural.

=== Shadow Chasers ===
In this setting, evil monsters, usually from one or more parallel dimensions, roam free around the world. However, most people do not see these creatures for what they really are, seeing instead a vague approximation which is still plausible in that person&#x27;s beliefs about reality. (See consensus reality.) For example, an ogre would appear to the average person as a very burly man. The player characters are somehow capable of seeing through this veil, and typically take on responsibility for defending humanity from the monsters. It originally appeared as a &quot;d20&quot; mini-game in &quot;Polyhedron Magazine&quot; issue #150.

=== Agents of Psi ===
In this campaign setting, magic (at least in the traditional sense) does not exist, but psychic capabilities called &quot;psionics&quot; do. Player characters typically work for a government agency investigating and/or using this quasi-supernatural force, but this is only a suggestion and is not strictly required by the rules. A novella taking place in this setting was published on the WotC website.

=== Urban Arcana ===

In this setting, dragons rule the boardrooms and bugbears rule the streets. It is a world where monsters and magic exist, yet the human psyche just cannot fathom them and covers up all supernatural events. Some, however, break that barrier and become aware of the world around them, and help Mages, Acolytes, and other magical characters fight with monsters from another realm. This campaign setting combines aspects of the previous two settings (&quot;Shadow Chasers&quot; &amp; &quot;Agents of Psi&quot;) and uses the concept that all three settings coexist in the same reality (at least in &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;).

=== Other settings ===

==== Dark•Matter: Shades of Grey ====

&quot;Dark•Matter: Shades of Grey&quot; is a &quot;d20 Modern&quot; mini-game of conspiratorial suspense presented in &quot;Polyhedron Magazine issue #167&quot; (also known as &quot;Dungeon Magazine issue #108&quot;) and then as a stand-alone &quot;d20 Modern&quot; book, &quot;Dark•Matter&quot;, in September 2006. It is a remake of the &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; campaign setting for &quot;Alternity&quot;. It uses concepts from the core &quot;d20 Modern RPG&quot; rules and the &quot;Urban Arcana&quot; and &quot;d20 Menace Manual&quot; sourcebooks, which are also recommended for use to get the most from the setting.

==== Mecha Crusade ====
&quot;Mecha Crusade&quot; was a &quot;d20&quot; mini-RPG campaign setting in issue #154 of &quot;Polyhedron Magazine&quot; (&quot;Dungeon Magazine&quot; issue #95).

The setting was a take off of anime mecha series, like Mobile Suit Gundam or Macross.

==== Pulp Heroes ====

&quot;Pulp Heroes&quot; started as a &quot;d20&quot; mini-RPG found in &quot;Polyhedron Magazine&quot; issue #149 (also known as &quot;Dungeon Magazine&quot; issue #90). &quot;Polyhedron #161&quot; (also known as &quot;Dungeon #102&quot;) contained a &quot;d20 Modern&quot; &quot;update&quot; of the &quot;Pulp Heroes&quot; mini-game.

The setting allows one to play games that take place during the famous Pulp Era of literature, filled with ancient dinosaurs, power-hungry gangsters, vengeful vigilantes, amazing superheroes, evil Nazis, bizarre inventions, mystical psionics, hard-boiled detectives, trained martial artists, curious explorers, eldritch aliens, and various other fantastic people, places, and things.

The worlds of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;, and famous individuals like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; serve as perfect examples of this era.

Many elements of &quot;Pulp Heroes&quot; were adapted into the later &quot;d20 Past&quot; sourcebook.

==== Thunderball Rally ====

&quot;Thunderball Rally&quot; was the second mini-game in a brief series of previews for &quot;d20 Modern&quot; that appeared in the early issues of the third and last edition of &quot;Polyhedron Magazine&quot;, which was on the flipside of &quot;Dungeon Magazine&quot;.

&quot;Thunderball Rally&quot;, released as a preview for the &quot;d20 MODERN RPG&quot; in &quot;Polyhedron #152&quot;, is a &quot;d20 System&quot; mini-game about racing across the United States of America in 1976. The game creates an imaginary cross-country car race, and uses &quot;d20 System&quot; modern vehicle rules. The vehicle rules that were described in the game were also recommended for use with the previous &quot;d20 Modern&quot; mini-game preview &quot;Shadow Chasers&quot; (&quot;Polyhedron #150&quot;).

In &quot;Thunderball Rally&quot;, the player characters portray one of the crews in the largest, most lucrative, most illegal crosscountry road race in America. Examples of the genre include &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;, &quot;Cannonball&quot; (and its later follow up/remake &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;), &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;, and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, and iconic characters include the General Lee and Boss Hogg. Rules for Orangutan player characters subsequently appeared in &quot;Polyhedron #153&quot; as a homage to the 1978 film &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;.

== Official products ==
==Reviews==
The 2002 &quot;Pyramid&quot; review highlights that compared to other non-fantasy modern settings &quot;it appears that in many ways, Wizards of the Coast has been significantly more conservative when adapting the &quot;d20 System&quot; to a modern setting. &quot;d20 Modern&quot; retains many elements that other modern and ultramodern games dispense with or modify, such as iterative attacks and hit points. However, &quot;d20 Modern&quot; uses some aspects of the game that appeared in the &quot;d20 Star Wars&quot; game. [...] The fundamental difference between the approach to classes and the corresponding &quot;D&amp;D&quot; classes is that the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; classes are much more general&quot;.

Mark Theuar, for the gaming magazine &quot;Fictional Reality&quot;, wrote that he would &quot;highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to play in a modern day rpg&quot; and that &quot;the interior artwork has sort of a graphic novel feel to it and it works very well for this setting&quot;. He highlighted his enjoyment of the section on guns and that &quot;combat is similar to Call of Cthulhu d20 meaning that you can get dead real quick. [...] My favorite aspect about the world background is that we&#x27;re already living about 90% of it. As a GM all you have to do is fill in the last 10%. It&#x27;s not like building or learning a whole new fantasy world from scratch&quot;. Theuar also &quot;particularly liked the Wealth system&quot;.

Academic Kris Green also highlighted the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; Wealth system in the book &quot;Mathematics in Popular Culture&quot; (2012) and called it an &quot;excellent example of abstraction&quot;. Green wrote that &quot;rather than force players to keep detailed records of every purchase a character makes and bank record he accesses, the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; designers created a single abstract quantity called &#x27;Wealth&#x27; that determines how easy it is for a character to acquire equipment and resources. Players roll against the difficulty (which incorporates cost and availability as well as legality) of acquiring a good, and their wealth may change as a result of the roll, representing in the abstract the loss of assets&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, stated that &quot;back in 2002, &quot;d20 Modern&quot; helped to breathe life into third edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, expanding the tabletop role-playing game into a far more contemporary setting — less swords and sorcery, more ninjas and automatic weapons&quot;. Shannon Appelcline commented that &quot;d20 Modern&quot; was &quot;sort of successful&quot; in launching a &quot;new wave of third-party&quot; publication which used the d20 System, however, many other publishers had already begun creating modern and science-fiction d20 System publications before the release of &quot;d20 Modern&quot;. This new wave included hundreds of third-party publications alongside the additional ten d20 Modern books Wizards of the Coast released. Appelcline wrote that &quot;Sword &amp; Sorcery was probably the most noticeable, with their licensed version of &quot;Gamma World&quot; (2003-2004), though they covered their bets by saying the books could be used with D&amp;D 3e or &quot;d20 Modern&quot;. But, many other publishers put out large &quot;d20 Modern&quot; lines. Some of the most notable were Adamant&#x27;s &quot;Thrilling Tales&quot; (2005-2007) and &quot;Mars&quot; (2006-2007) line, Green Ronin&#x27;s varied &quot;d20 Modern&quot; rules and settings, which culminated in &quot;Damnation Decade&quot; (2006), and Mongoose&#x27;s new editions of the classic &quot;Macho Women with Guns&quot; (2003, 2005)&quot;.

=== &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; ===
In 2022, Jeff Grubb – co-creator of &quot;d20 Modern&quot; – announced an upcoming role-playing system titled &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; which is based on the 5th edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ruleset via Wizard&#x27;s Open Game License. Sigfried Trent, one of the lead designers, described the game as merger of &quot;the theme, the setting, the mood, the feeling of &quot;d20 Modern&quot;&quot; and &quot;the rules, the simplicity, and the modularity of 5e&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; called &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot; a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; to &quot;d20 Modern&quot;.

This system will be published by Evil Genius Games and will include licensed settings such as &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, and &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;.

<text>Candice Night (born May 8, 1971) is an American singer and musician. She has been the vocalist/lyricist and multi-instrumentalist for the traditional folk rock project Blackmore&#x27;s Night since its origins in 1997 with her husband, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. She is also the backing vocalist for Rainbow from 1994 to 1997 and 2015–present, again with Blackmore. Her first solo album, &quot;Reflections&quot;, was released in 2011.

== Career ==
Born in Hauppauge, Long Island, New York, as Candice Lauren Isralow, she took piano lessons for a couple of years. She began modeling as &quot;Candice Loren&quot; at 12 years of age. She appeared in everything from commercials to print ads, and promoted products at trade shows until her 20s. Night also had her own radio show on a rock music radio station on Long Island, and attended New York Institute of Technology where she studied communications. She is Jewish.

She was once a Rainbow fan, and met Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989. They talked about ghosts, music, travel, history, and philosophy, gradually became friends, and then lived together from 1991. She provided backing vocals on the instrumental track &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; in 1993&#x27;s European tour of Deep Purple. She also provided singing backing vocals on &quot;Ariel&quot;, &quot;Black Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Wolf to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; for &quot;Stranger in Us All&quot;, the CD by Rainbow, as well as writing lyrics for the four songs on the aforementioned album. Despite her being inexperienced as a professional lead singer, Blackmore encouraged her to become his musical partner. She then wrote lyrics for most of the songs on the first Blackmore&#x27;s Night album, &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; where she supplied lead vocals. Those songs were written with her voice in his mind.

Night has also composed some full songs, including &quot;Now and Then&quot; on &quot;Under a Violet Moon&quot; (1999) and &quot;3 Black Crows&quot; and &quot;Ivory Tower&quot; on &quot;Ghost of a Rose&quot; (2003). She continues to write all the lyrics for the Blackmore&#x27;s Night songs and plays nine renaissance and medieval instruments.

Since then, she has been awarded gold albums and other awards for the music of Blackmore&#x27;s Night, and has charted internationally with the group&#x27;s music. Their 2008 release, &quot;Secret Voyage&quot;, entered at on the new-age Billboard Charts and stayed there for four weeks, and then held on in the top 10 for an additional 14 weeks. She continues to be involved in music, performing both on CDs and in concert, writing lyrics, singing, and playing medieval instruments: shawm, cornamuse, rauschpfeife, pennywhistle, and chanters.

In 2006, Night sang on Helloween&#x27;s &quot;Light the Universe&quot; song from their &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy&quot; album, and she also appeared In Helloween&#x27;s music video for that track.

She played the part of Oria in the rock opera &quot;Story of Aina&quot;, with Sass Jordan and Glenn Hughes. She sang three songs on Beto Vázquez Infinity&#x27;s eponymous album with Tarja Turunen from Nightwish and Sabine Edelsbacher from Edenbridge. The Blackmore&#x27;s Night song &quot;Old Mill Inn&quot; was heard in Jim Carrey&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Yes Man&quot;.

She also appears on interactive video screens throughout the US and Japan in the theme park MagiQuest as both Princess Amora and Princess Candice. These parks now have a cooperation throughout the US. She was also the Faerie Queen for &quot;Faerie Magazine&quot; for two years, appearing on the cover in spring 2007, and making appearances and performing at the Faerie Festivals throughout the US.

After being engaged for nearly fifteen years, Night and Blackmore married in October 2008.

Their daughter, Autumn, was born on May 27, 2010, and was the inspiration for Blackmore&#x27;s Night&#x27;s album, &quot;Autumn Sky&quot;, which was released in September 2010.
On February 7, 2012, Night gave birth to their second child, a son named Rory Dartanyan.

She made her first solo album &quot;Reflections&quot;, which was released in October 2011. All songs were written by Night and consist of mostly soft rock ballads. Her latest solo release is &quot;Starlight, Starbright&quot;. Inspired by the birth of her children, this collection of songs are covers of classic favorites as well as new composition meant to bring the listener to the land of dreams.

In September 2018, Avantasia&#x27;s mastermind Tobias Sammet announced that Night joined the cast for the eighth studio album of the supergroup. She provided co-lead vocals (together with Sammet himself) for the track &quot;Moonglow&quot;, from the album of the same name (2019).
Candice and dArtagnan released the duet &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Be Drinking&quot; in 2022.

<text>A licentiate (abbreviated Lic.) is an academic degree present in many countries, representing different educational levels.
It may be similar to a master&#x27;s degree when issued by pontifical universities and other universities in Europe, Latin America, and Syria.

The term is also used for a person who holds this degree.

==Etymology==
The term derives from Latin &quot;licentia&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot; (from Latin &quot;licēre&quot;, &quot;to be allowed&quot;), which is applied in the phrases licentia docendi (also licentia doctorandi), meaning &quot;permission to teach&quot;, and licentia ad practicandum (also licentia practicandi), meaning &quot;permission to practice&quot;, signifying someone who holds a certificate of competence to practise a profession.

== History ==
The Gregorian Reform of the Catholic Church led to an increased focus on the liberal arts in episcopal schools during the 11th and 12th centuries, with Pope Gregory VII ordering all bishops to make provisions for the teaching of liberal arts. Chancellors and scholasters exercised a high degree of control over who could teach within their &quot;locus magisterii&quot;, or area of teaching authority. Throughout the 12th century, the degree of their control tightened to such an extent that they had essential monopolies over all teachers in their dioceses, and teachers were barred from acting as instructors without the explicit authorization of their scholasters. Conflicts sometimes arose between the scholasters and local independent educators who operated educational facilities without their permission, and chancellors often demanded expensive gifts before granting a license to teach. In response to these escalating abuses of power, Pope Alexander III demanded that a free &quot;licentia docendi&quot; should be granted to anyone deemed qualified to teach. This allowed the Church progressively to centralize its educational control, reducing the power of individual scholasters.

Originally, for the student in the medieval university the &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was of a somewhat different nature than the academic degrees of bachelor, master or doctor. The latter essentially indicated the rank of seniority in the various faculties (arts, theology, law, medicine), whereas the licentia was literally the licence to teach. It was awarded not by the university but by the church, embodied in the chancellor of the diocese in which the university was located. The licentia would only be awarded, however, upon recommendation by the university, initially shortly before the candidate would be awarded the final degree of master or doctor, the requirements for which beyond having been awarded the licentia were only of a ceremonial nature.

Over time, however, this distinction in nature between the &quot;licentia&quot; on the one hand and the bachelor, master and doctor degrees on the other began to fade. In the continental European universities the &quot;licentia&quot; became an academic degree intermediate between the bachelor&#x27;s degree on the one hand and the master&#x27;s or doctor&#x27;s degree on the other, in particular in the higher faculties. Moreover, the costs for obtaining the doctorate could be significant. As a result, most students not intending an academic career would forgo the doctorate, and as a result the licentiate became the common final degree.

Notable exceptions to this development were the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and the universities modelled after them. As their locations were not the seats of bishops, the granting of the &quot;licentia docendi&quot; was by proxy, and its significance faded away.

== Regional variations ==

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, the &quot;Licentiate&quot; degree (Spanish: ), by which one becomes a &quot;licenciado&quot;, is a four to six-year degree with a required final thesis defence. Upon competition of the licentiate degree the student may be eligible to apply for a postgraduate degree such as a master or doctorate.

=== Australia ===
Currently the only institutions in Australia to grant licentiates, apart from theological colleges, are the Australian Music Examinations Board and St Cecilia School of Music, which confer licentiate diplomas. The status of this award is similar to that of an Australian diploma—currently one year of post-secondary education—and so it is a lesser award than a degree, although this award can usually take two or more years to complete due to its high standard. Similarly, for theological colleges in former times, the licentiate was a specific post graduate award, analogous to a current graduate diploma. It was used specifically because some theological colleges did not enjoy university status, and could not award degrees such as baccalaureates, masters and doctorates. Though this was never the case in Catholic Colleges where the Licentiate cannot be earned until one has completed 7 years of study (5 for the baccalaureate and 2 for the licentiate). In such an instance, it sits well above the level of graduate diploma between that of master&#x27;s and doctorate.

The Catholic Institute of Sydney is a Pontifical Faculty and as such offers the Licentiate of Sacred Theology which ranks above a master&#x27;s degree and can only be earned after seven years of study (five years for the S.T.B.; two years for the S.T.L.). The licentiate is part of the three cycles of theological education in the Roman Catholic Church that was instituted in 1931: baccalaureate (STB); licentiate (STL) and doctorate (STD). It is the licentiate that licences faculty to teach in seminaries. See John Paul II&#x27;s apostolic constitution, &quot;Sapientia Christiana&quot;.

=== Belgium ===
At Belgian universities, a person titled &quot;Licentiate&quot; (or &quot;Licentiaat&quot; in Dutch or &quot;Licencié&quot; in French, abbreviated &quot;lic.&quot;) holds the equivalent education of a master&#x27;s degree. A female &quot;Licentiate&quot; was called &quot;Licentiate&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Licenciée&quot; in French. The years spent to obtain the degree of &quot;Licentiate&quot; were called &quot;Licentiaat&quot; or &quot;Licentie&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Licence&quot; in French. It was the second level of university study, after that of &quot;Candidate&quot; (or &quot;Kandidaat&quot; in Dutch or &quot;Candidat&quot; in French, abbreviated &quot;cand.&quot;). A female &quot;Candidate&quot; was called &quot;Kandidate&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Candidate&quot; in French. The years spent to obtain the degree of &quot;Candidate&quot; were called &quot;Kandidaats&quot; or &quot;Kandidatuur&quot; in Dutch and &quot;Candidature&quot; in French. Each of those two levels required at least two years (four semesters) of successful study. Licentiates were required to write a thesis (called in Dutch and &#x27; in French). This &quot;candidate-licentiate&quot; system is now being replaced by an American-style &quot;bachelor-master&quot; system. &quot;Civil engineer&quot; (or &quot;Burgerlijk ingenieur&quot; in Dutch or &quot;Ingénieur civil&quot; in French, abbreviated &quot;ir.&quot;), &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; (or in Dutch or in French, abbreviated &quot;dr. med.&quot;, until 1992), &quot;Physician&quot; (or &quot;Arts&quot; in Dutch or &quot;Médecin&quot; in French, after 1992), &quot;Doctor of Law&quot; (or &#x27; in Dutch or &quot;&quot; in French, abbreviated &quot;dr. iur.&quot;, until 1972) and &quot;Magister&quot; (philosophy and theology, abbreviated &quot;mag.&quot;) were equivalent to &quot;Licentiate&quot;. &quot;Baccalaureus&quot; (philosophy and theology, abbreviated &quot;bac.&quot;) was equivalent to &quot;Candidate&quot;. The former titles &quot;dr. med.&quot; and &quot;dr. iur.&quot; are to be considered as professional doctorates, whereas the title &quot;dr.&quot;, which is the result of third level study and research, is a higher doctorate. The Belgian &quot;licentiate&quot; was also equivalent to the &quot;doctorandus&quot; in the Netherlands. At the KU Leuven there used to be a degree &quot;Licentiaat-doctorandus in de TEW (Toegepaste Economische Wetenschappen) en in Beleidsinformatica&quot;. Apart from the general abbreviation &quot;lic.&quot;, more specific abbreviations, such as &quot;LHFW&quot; (&quot;Licentiaat in de Handels- en Financiële Wetenschappen&quot;) and &quot;LTH&quot; (&quot;Licentiaat in de Tandheelkunde&quot;) exist.
Study for a Belgian degree is very rigorous. Students in Belgian universities usually spend more than thirty hours a week on their studies, as opposed to the average of fifteen hours at American universities. As a result of this, students in Belgium are able to complete their licentiate or master&#x27;s degrees in four to five years, as opposed to the usual six at American institutions.

=== Bolivia ===
In Bolivia, a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is a professional degree distinct from the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor in Science, which are more common in the Anglosphere, as it requires that the student take more credits for the completion of a professional curricula. The Licenciatura allows the holder to practice his or her profession in all of Bolivia. The durational requirements to obtain a Licenciatura vary depending on the profession studied; however, most universities require the completion of the curricula within four to five years. Aside from the durational requirements, Bolivian universities also require that all candidates, at the completion of the curricula, complement their studies by writing a thesis or by sitting for an oral examination in which State and University representatives take part by testing the student&#x27;s professional knowledge and skills.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is a professional degree distinct from the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science, as it requires students to take more credits for the completion of a professional &quot;curriculum&quot;. The Licenciatura degree allows its holder to teach disciplines both in primary and secondary education. Although durational requirements to obtain &quot;Licenciatura&quot; often depend on the topic studied, most universities require the completion of the curriculum within four to five years. Besides the durational requirements for academic activities, Brazilian universities may also require that degree candidates complement their studies by writing a dissertation and apply for an oral examination. This evaluation is performed by Professors and or Researchers aiming to assess the student&#x27;s professional knowledge and skills.

For instance, as defined by the Brazilian National Council of Education (Ministry of Education), a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; modality in Biological Sciences should include, in addition to specific topics of Biology, contents in the areas of Chemistry, Physics and Health, to attend elementary and secondary education. Pedagogical training, in addition to its specificities, should contemplate an overview of the education and the formative processes of the students. It should also emphasize the instrumentation for the teaching of Sciences at the fundamental level and for the teaching of biology at the intermediate level. In some Brazilian universities, Bachelor&#x27;s degree and Licenciatura can be obtained concomitantly, by simultaneously fulfilling requirements for both the degrees (e.g. the &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Licenciatura&quot; degrees in Biological Sciences, offered by the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, Brazil).

=== Canada ===
While the term &quot;licentiate&quot; is not generally used by Canadian academic institutions, a Licentiate in Laws (LL.L.) is offered by some Canadian universities for the completion of studies equivalent to a Bachelor of Civil Law.
A licentiate is also offered by the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) upon completion of a series of Medical Council of Canada Qualifying examinations for Canadian and International medical graduates. This licentiate is required to obtain an independent medical practice licence in Canada.

Saint Paul University offers the degree of Licentiate in Philosophy by examination, which may be undertaken within ten years of receiving an MA from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Ottawa. This licentiate, a pontifical degree, qualifies graduates to teach philosophy at a seminary or college. Saint Paul University also offers a Licentiate in Canon Law that enables the recipient to practice as a canon lawyer within the Roman Catholic Church, as well as a Licentiate in Sacred Theology which is part of the baccalaureate, licentiate, and doctorate theological degree course within the Roman Catholic Church.

Regis College, University of Toronto offers the degree of Licentiate in Sacred Theology. It is part of the cycle of baccalaureate, licentiate, doctorate in theological formation in the Roman Catholic Church. It can be earned while studying for a civil master&#x27;s or doctoral degree. It probably sits in rank between the two levels. See John Paul II&#x27;s apostolic constitution, &quot;Sapientia Christiana&quot;.

The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies at the University of Toronto offers a License in Mediaeval Studies (LMS) as a degree exclusively for postdoctoral students who have already completed a PhD. (The application for the LMS refers to it as a &quot;licentiate&quot; and not as a &quot;license&quot;.) The degree is unusual in that licentiates from Pontifical institutions are usually a precursor to a doctorate, and not a post-doctoral achievement.

The Royal Conservatory of Music, Toronto, offers a Licentiate Diploma (LRCM) in Piano Performance. The LRCM is the highest level of The Royal Conservatory Certificate Program. The examination is evaluated as a professional concert performance. Candidates are expected to demonstrate a masterful command of the instrument and communicate an understanding of stylistic characteristics and structural elements of each repertoire selection with interpretive insight and a mature musical personality.

=== Costa Rica ===

In Costa Rica, a licentiate belongs to the second level of education (grade), lower than a master&#x27;s degree but higher than a bachelor&#x27;s degree, according to the Office for the Planning of Higher Education, part of the National Council of Rectors. Licentiate is extended to those who have fulfilled the requirements of a university program that has a minimum of 150 and a maximum of 180 course credits (public university programs usually last from four to six years of study) and a minimum duration of 10 lesson cycles of 15 weeks or its equivalent (three or four extra course semesters after the completion of the bachelor&#x27;s degree).

Students are also required to fulfill the requirements for graduation for each institution, with usually requires writing a thesis in some universities, attending a graduation seminar, or developing a project in order to graduate, and some degrees involve the same credits as a master&#x27;s degree but not the same level of rigor. This is also the degree conferred to a practicing physician. The degree is not considered terminal, and it is not sufficient to be a rector of a private university.

=== Denmark and Norway ===
The licentiate was formerly awarded in Denmark and Norway, and was roughly equal to the American PhD degree. In Denmark, it has formally been replaced by the PhD degree. The proper doctorates in Denmark are considered higher degrees than the PhD (i.e. higher doctorates).

=== Dominican Republic ===
In the Dominican Republic, a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is awarded to students after studies of four to six years. Some universities require students to write a thesis in order to graduate while others have to write a shorter, and less labor-intensive, monograph. The Licenciatura is one of the major University degree previous to doctoral studies.

=== Finland and Sweden ===

In Swedish and Finnish universities, a licentiate&#x27;s degree, recognised as a pre-doctoral degree, is equal to completion of the coursework and a dissertation which is formally equivalent to half of a doctoral dissertation. In Finland, the extent of licentiate degree is 120 ECTS equivalent and it requires two to three years of full-time research. Its prerequisite is a completed 4-year academic degree at advanced level, such as a Master&#x27;s degree or a Magister&#x27;s degree. Licentiate degree holders are officially eligible for independent scientific research in Universities, and entitled to the right to supervise master&#x27;s and licentiate degree theses.

Until the early 1970s, the degree in Sweden was equivalent to the U.S. PhD requiring four to seven years of study after the Bachelor&#x27;s (or Master&#x27;s) degree, and a publicly defended thesis. It was gradually substituted with the &quot;Doctor&#x27;s exam&quot; in 1969 and was re-instituted as an intermediate level in research training in the 1980s, now requiring only two years of study after Masters graduation. The licentiate&#x27;s degree is called a in Swedish and in Finnish (Licentiate of Philosophy), &quot;teologie licentiat&quot; and &quot;teologian lisensiaatti&quot; (Licentiate of Theology) etc., depending on the faculty. Furthermore, the requisite degree for a physician&#x27;s licence is &quot;licentiat/lisensiaatti&quot;; there is no master&#x27;s degree. (The degree &quot;lääketieteen tohtori&quot;, &quot;medicine doktor&quot;, &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; is a traditional professor&#x27;s degree, or a research doctorate, with licentiate as a prerequisite.)

The Licentiate of Engineering is an intermediate postgraduate degree used only in a few countries, among them Sweden and Finland, and can be seen as an academic step halfway between a Master&#x27;s and a PhD. In Swedish, it is called , usually abbreviated as &quot;Tekn. Lic.&quot;, and in Finnish, , abbreviated as &quot;TkL&quot;. The Licentiate of Engineering corresponds to 120 ECTS credits (80 workweeks (old credits)), or nominally two years of full-time work, whereas a PhD amounts to 240 ECTS credits (160 workweeks (old credits)), or a nominal period of four years of full-time work (one old credit equals one week of full-time studies). However, as a result of the differences in requirements and individual performance, the time to complete a Licentiate of Engineering degree varies. For the thesis, 2–3 peer-refereed articles (or an equivalent monograph) is usually required, and there is no requirement for original research &quot;per se&quot;. In contrast, a doctoral thesis requires 4–6 articles and must demonstrate original research. The program for a licentiate degree is equivalent to a total of two years of full-time study.

=== France ===
In French universities, a licenciate (&quot;licencié(e)&quot;) is the holder of a &quot;licence&quot; (), which is a three-year degree, roughly equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. There are two kinds of licence: general and professional.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, a person titled &quot;Lizentiat&quot; holds the equivalent education of a Master&#x27;s degree or Diplom. Until the 1990s, the degree was offered as a law degree at the Saarland University as a single university degree (Lic.iur.) with a duration varying between five and eight years. For political reasons, this degree was discontinued, mainly because the Staatsexamen (Law degree) became the predominant representation of the mainstream education of a lawyer. The Lizentiat is largely equivalent to the 1. Staatsexamen but, unlike the latter, is assessed by the university, not the state administration. It also allowed specialisation in areas of the law which were either not covered by other legal qualifications, e.g. ecclesiastical law etc., or not covered to the same extent. Other disciplines, such as theology or journalism (FU Berlin), used to offer a &quot;Lizentiat&quot; qualification instead of a PhD.

=== Haiti ===
In Haiti universities, a licenciate (licencié(e)) is the holder of a licence, which is a four-year degree, equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. There are two kinds of licence: general and professional.

The general licence is a diploma issued by a university and authenticated by the national department of education. This authentication confirms the school follows and complies to the national curriculum requirements for a four-year baccalaureat (bachelor&#x27;s) degree.

The professional licence is a Certificate licence issued by a university and authenticated national Department of education after the licenciate diploma holder submits a final paper research that have been analyzed and graded by a board of professors or faculty jury member from the school.

=== Hong Kong ===
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (HKSAR) offers a Licentiate of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (LMCHK). This licentiate is required of non-locally trained doctors in order to register as a medical practitioner in Hong Kong. The LMCHK qualification forms part of the pathway towards registration to practice medicine in Hong Kong for those that graduated from medical schools outside of Hong Kong. The Licentiate Society is an independent, non-profit professional body formed to help candidates with the challenges of attaining the LMCHK.

=== India ===
In India, the Licentiate is a vocational qualification offered by the special vocational boards or professional bodies. These are offered after completion of school education and are somewhat less extensive than a full-fledged university degree. Issuers of the licentiate degree include but are not limited to the Insurance Institute of India, the Institute of Company Secretaries of India, the Association of Mutual Funds of India, and the Diploma Examination Board of the government of Andhra Pradesh.

Licentiate Certified Physician and Surgeon (LCPS) was a recognized medical qualification in India before 1946, when the Bhore Committee effectively made the MBBS the sole entry point into the medical profession in India.

=== Mexico ===
As in many Latin American countries, the &quot;licenciatura&quot; is a general term denoting the first higher-education degree awarded at universities, varying from three to five years of study, depending on the field. It is thus an undergraduate degree, and requires a licence to practice in the learned profession.

In Mexico, a distinction is made between simply passing all the required courses, just being a graduate (&quot;graduado&quot; or &quot;pasante&quot;), and actually obtaining the degree diploma (&quot;título profesional&quot;). Obtaining the diploma means the student completely concluded his or her studies, and has the right of using the title of &quot;Licenciado&quot;. Statistics show that historically only about 60% of those graduating actually obtain the diploma. At the same time the diploma is awarded, a professional credential (&quot;cédula profesional&quot;) may be obtained from the National Directorate of Professions (&quot;Dirección General de Profesiones, DGP&quot;), which serves as a licence to practice and as a national ID card. Some professions do not require the professional credential, but for others, like medicine, accounting, civil engineering, or social work, it is mandatory by law. The law also establishes penalties for crimes committed regarding the professional practice, including those in which an individual offers professional services without having the proper diploma or licence.

For a number of years, presenting a thesis was the only method to obtain the diploma (&quot;título&quot;). Nowadays, some universities, like the National Autonomous University of Mexico, may still require the thesis, while others, like the federal institutes of technology, may forgo the thesis in exchange for demonstrating professional experience, research work, or excellent academic grades.

By their nature, some disciplines, such as nursing, medicine and law, require an intense theoretical background, as well as practical training, and so a first university degree in those areas may take longer to complete (up to 6 years). Even after obtaining the diploma, graduates require passing a national exam to finally be awarded the professional licence.

In Mexico, every graduate who obtained a &quot;licenciatura&quot; diploma is technically and legally a &quot;licenciado&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Lic.&quot; before the name). However, it is mostly common to use &quot;Lic.&quot; for graduates of the social sciences, while more specific titles and prefixes are used for other professionals such as engineer (&quot;Ingeniero, Ing.&quot;), architect (&quot;Arquitecto, Arq.&quot;), or biologist (&quot;Biólogo, Biol.&quot;).

In Mexico, the &quot;licenciatura&quot; qualifies the recipient to pursue a master&#x27;s degree (&quot;maestría&quot;). In exceptional cases, the recipient may apply directly to a doctoral degree (&quot;doctorado&quot;), in which case the study plan integrates coursework from the master&#x27;s program, and may take up to five years to complete.

According to the Bologna process in Europe, virtually any &quot;licenciado&quot; has the equivalent qualifications of a 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degree. The Mexican &quot;licenciatura&quot;, however, should never be confused with a more advanced postgraduate degree, such as the Swedish &quot;Licenciate of Technology&quot; (&quot;Teknologie Licentiat&quot;).

=== New Zealand ===
The Photographic Society of New Zealand awards a licentiateship, Licentiate (LPSNZ), for &quot;proficiency of a high order in practical photography.&quot; This means the applicant must demonstrate sound basic technical ability, along with good compositional skill, and awareness of lighting. Proficiency implies skill with the camera and in processing and presenting images. This is the first of three honours available the other two being Associate (APSNZ) and Fellow (FPSNZ).

=== Nicaragua ===
In Nicaragua, a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is awarded to students after undergraduate studies ranging between four and six years. Students are required to write a thesis if studying in the liberal arts, law or science in order to graduate. Students in engineering typically complete &quot;módulos,&quot; which are additional post-degree requirements before graduating. Additionally, there are Nicaraguan universities that require an internship &quot;(internado or pasantía&quot;) prior to graduation. The Licenciatura is the degree that segues candidates into both masters and/or PhD programs.

=== Panama ===
This degree is awarded upon completion of four years of study in a specific field of study – e.g., &quot;Licenciatura de Docencia en inglés&quot; (Licentiate in Teaching of English), and qualifies the recipient to pursue a master&#x27;s degree, or teach at a high school or middle school level with additional training. In order to be able to teach at university level, the recipient of a licentiate must complete the &quot;Posgrado de Docencia Superior&quot; (Postgraduate of Tertiary Education), which may be obtained before or after a master&#x27;s degree.

=== Peru ===
In Peru, &quot;Bachiller&quot; is awarded automatically for having completed all the courses required for obtaining the first academic degree. In Peru, a &quot;Bachiller&quot; degree is the first academic degree and allows one to enroll in a master&#x27;s degree course. The master&#x27;s degree is the second degree and it allows you to get a Doctor&#x27;s degree (equivalent to a PhD).

The &quot;Licenciatura&quot; in Peru is not considered an academic degree, but rather a &quot;Professional Title&quot; within a specific profession which allows you to work in positions outside academia and perform as an independent professional in the Republic of Peru. Most professions require the &quot;Licenciatura&quot; or &quot;Professional Title&quot; to be able to register with professional association or society (&quot;Colegio Profesional&quot;). To obtain a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; it is required to either pass an additional test or defend a thesis. Although most Bachelor courses in Peru require to complete &quot;Thesis work&quot; or &quot;Thesis seminars&quot; modules(usually developing a research project during the last two semesters of the course) to obtain the degree, it is not mandatory to defend it. To obtain a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; or &quot;Título Profesional&quot; the student is required to write a thesis (usually that developed during their bachelor course), and pass their viva voce. Alternatively, it is possible to complete a written exam and then an oral examination in front of a group of professors (who are registered in the professional college/body of that specific profession). With this last option, it is usually required to have at least one year of professional experience in the relevant field of studies. Therefore, for some professions which used to be called &quot;carreras largas&quot; or long careers (e.g. dentistry, law, psychology and medicine), the student requires more than five years of studies or ten semesters to become a member of a professional body.

Nowadays, some universities do not use the word &quot;Licenciado&quot; or &quot;Licenciada&quot; as a prefix before the professional title, e.g. &quot;Licenciado/a en Farmacia y Bioquímica&quot; (Licentiate in Pharmacy and Biochemistry) in their certificates. Instead they use &quot;Químico Farmacéutico&quot;, the same happens in with the other professions (i.e. Enfermero, Ingeniero, Psicólogo.) In such cases, both written titles are equivalent. The Professional Titles in Peru are equivalent to the professional degrees in the US, therefore if a person obtained a Master in Counselling degree in the US will need to complete the university studies in Peru in order to obtain the Licenciate or Title of Psychologist and then the Licensure at the Colegio de Psicólogos del Perú. In Peru the Professional Title of Psicólogo is similar to the Psy.D which is given in the US.

=== Poland ===
A &quot;licencjat&quot; is a degree that was introduced in Poland by the tertiary education reforms. The purpose of these reforms was to bring the Polish university system into line with the Bologna system. It is typically a three- or four-year degree, equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Students completing a &quot;licencjat&quot; often go on to complete a &quot;magister&quot;&#x27;s degree.
In theology faculties which use Vatican-regulated degrees, &quot;licencjat&quot; is a degree between that of master and doctor.

=== Portugal ===
Due to the developments introduced by the Bologna Process in the mid-2000s, in Portugal the licentiate&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licenciatura&quot;) may refer to both old and new &quot;Licenciaturas&quot;, which were awarded before and after the Bologna&#x27;s reforms, respectively. The length of the old &quot;Licenciatura&quot; programs would range from four to six years and are now equivalent to the new Master&#x27;s degrees. In the past, a master&#x27;s degree would add 2 more years to the 4 to 6 years of the old undergraduate &quot;Licenciatura&quot; programs, thus taking 6 to 8 years of post-secondary education to obtain a master&#x27;s degree. The new &quot;Licenciatura&quot; degrees that are now being awarded in Portugal and in almost all Europe with varying local designations, are usually three-year programs.

Since 2006, in the Portuguese higher education system, &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is the first degree awarded by institutions of higher education. It is also the first degree used in the European Higher Education Area, and is also designated a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in other European countries. The Master&#x27;s degree entails a two-year program of study, in which students can normally enroll after completing a licentiate&#x27;s degree, and provides higher qualification for employment (e.g., for Architecture or Medicine a Master&#x27;s is required, as well as for some Engineering branches, entailing a total of 5 to 6 years of post-secondary studies) or to prepare a student for his or her PhD research or work permit from the regulatory and licensing body for profession in Portugal.

=== Romania ===
In Romania, before the Bologna process, a licence (Rom. &quot;licenţă&quot;) was an academic degree awarded after four to six years of study, finalised by a thesis. It was a degree higher than the graduate diploma obtained after three years of study, which was mostly used in pedagogical institutes that trained secondary education teachers, and was considered inferior to the doctorate. A Romanian licence was the equivalent of a French &quot;maîtrise&quot; or a German Diplom. There are some Romanian licences (obtained before the Bologna process was of application) which have been recognized as meester (mr.) and doctorandus (drs.) in the Netherlands, i.e. at the LLM and MA level. Now, after the Bologna process, the Romanian licence is similar to a Bachelor&#x27;s degree.

=== Serbia ===
In Serbia and rest of former Yugoslavia region, the name of the degree was &quot;magistar&quot;, which was awarded after one year of postgraduate studies and finishing the &quot;magistar&quot; thesis on a scientific subject. The basic graduate studies was four years before that. Accepting the Bolognia process, Serbia changed its academic degrees and the names of degrees were synchronized with other western school systems. Basically, there are 3 levels of studies now: 1. bachelor, 2. master and 3. PhD (Ser. ), but also there are two semi-levels of specialization. Between 1st and 2nd level are professional master&#x27;s degree studies (Ser. ) and between 2nd and 3rd level are academic specialist studies (Ser. ). That studies between 2nd and 3rd level of education are equal to licentiate level. It is formally at the 2nd level of academic studies with the master studies (at the same level). As a professional degree, when ranking employees, it is on 3rd level, together with PhD studies.

The main purpose for having such a semi-level is to enable students, who cannot finish PhD studies but reached certain significant level of additional knowledge (around first half of PhD studies), to get certificate about finishing one stage of the PhD studies and continue those studies later in life. To get to the &quot;specialist&quot; level, it is needed first to pass master&#x27;s degree, then study for a year, after which the candidate need to defend the final specialist academic thesis which is a document describing a research in the scientific and professional area, winning additional 60 ECTS for overall study.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, the &quot;Licenciatura&quot; degree was one of the major higher-education degrees previous to doctoral studies, and is equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree in the anglophone system. This degree is currently being phased out at Spanish universities, replaced by the &#x27;Grado&#x27; and &#x27;Master&#x27; system due to the implementation of the Bologna Declaration on the European higher education area.

The &quot;Licenciatura&quot; academic degree is academically equivalent to the &quot;Ingeniero&quot; or &quot;Arquitecto&quot; degrees. A &quot;Licenciatura&quot; typically required from four to six years of university courses, and had a typical credit workload of 300 to 400 credits. It usually had two or three introductory years (first cycle, after which the candidate could obtain a Diplomatura or Bachelor&#x27;s degree in that field of studies) and two additional years (second cycle) for specialization (but this could vary from one to three). In addition, there existed a third cycle, comprising PhD degrees (&quot;doctorado&quot;, which included one or two years of research oriented courses and the completion of a thesis towards the same &quot;doctor&quot; diploma). When studying for a &quot;Licenciatura&quot;, completion of the first cycle did not automatically lead to the award of a diploma. However, students could elect to study specialized three-year degrees from the outset (&quot;diplomaturas&quot;, and &quot;arquitecturas técnicas&quot;—technical engineering), which, after successful completion, would give access to the second cycle of a number of &quot;Licenciaturas&quot;. A &quot;Licenciatura&quot; degree also provided direct access to professional practice or membership in professional associations such as Bar Associations for lawyers (&quot;Colegio de Abogados&quot;, until Bar membership requirements were changed to include a minimum amount of legal work experience and passing an exam), medicine, economics, and other regulated professions.

The third cycle was sometimes called postgrado. Note, however, that the label &quot;undergraduate&quot; may be misleading to an anglophone audience, since while a Spanish &quot;Diplomatura&quot; may be likened to an undergraduate Bachelor&#x27;s degree, a Spanish &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is comparable in scope to a postgraduate Master&#x27;s degree, as the anglophone distinction between &quot;undergraduate&quot; and &quot;postgraduate&quot; degrees does not properly apply to the traditional higher-education system of Spain. Many Spanish &quot;licenciados&quot;, when translating their CVs into English, use the formula BA+MA (or BSc+MSc) to indicate that a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. Depending on the degree and study plan, some Spanish universities require a small thesis or research project to be submitted in the last year before the student can finally claim his or her degree.

The Spanish government issued a royal decree in 2014 establishing the official equivalences between the Spanish pre-Bologna titles and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) levels. This royal decree also describes the procedure for applying for a personal certificate stating the equivalence of a given pre-Bologna title to the new Bologna levels. Most &quot;Licenciaturas&quot; (if not all) have been placed in level 7 (Master) of the EQF.

After the Bologna process, all official university degrees will fall into one of these three categories: &quot;Grado&quot; (Bachelor), Master or Doctor. Most &quot;Grados&quot; will consist of three or four years (240 ECTS credits), unless it is otherwise ruled by an EU Directive (like Pharmacy, five years, or Medicine, six years). All university students completing these four years will get a &quot;Grado&quot; and may then go on with Master&#x27;s studies (one to two years, 60-120 ECTS credits). Doctorate studies will in most cases require a research-oriented master&#x27;s degree and may or may not include specific courses.

&quot;Grados&quot; will take one year more than the old &quot;Diplomatura&quot; or &quot;Ingeniería Técnica&quot; degrees, and graduates from the old system may have to study additional courses to transform their degree into a &quot;Grado&quot;. Nevertheless, in most aspects, &quot;Grados&quot; will be the equivalent of the old intermediate degrees: &quot;Grado&quot; engineers will have the responsibilities of former &quot;Ingenieros técnicos&quot;. Lawyers will need a master&#x27;s degree, not a &quot;Grado&quot;. And in public service, &quot;Grado&quot; holders will by default be in the A2 level (the second highest), while A1 (the highest) will be for &quot;Grado&quot; holders with additional requirements (such as a master&#x27;s or a doctorate, or a special &quot;Grado&quot; such as Medicine that is in many aspects equivalent to a master&#x27;s).

Prior to the Bologna process, the master&#x27;s degree was not considered an official academic degree in Spain, as the transition from undergraduate to postgraduate studies could only be done directly from a &quot;Licenciatura&quot; to doctoral studies.

=== Switzerland ===
At Swiss universities, until the adoption of the Bologna Convention, the &quot;Lizentiat/licence&quot; was the equivalent of a master&#x27;s degree (there being no prior degrees) and qualified the holder for doctoral studies. The degree names are followed by the field of study (e.g. &quot;lic. phil.&quot;, &quot;lic. ès lettres&quot;, &quot;lic. oec.&quot;, etc.). In line with the Bologna Process, the degree has now been replaced by master&#x27;s degrees (with bachelor&#x27;s degrees being newly introduced).

According to the Swiss University Conference, the joint organization of the cantons and the Confederation for university politics, and the Rectors&#x27; Conference of the Swiss Universities, the old &quot;Lizentiat/licence&quot; is considered equivalent to the current master&#x27;s degree.

ETH Zurich stated that they consider the Swiss licenciate as equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree, though they state it is not the same.

=== United Kingdom ===
The University of Wales, Lampeter offers Licences in Latin and Greek. They are postgraduate diplomas – meaning that the student would normally have completed a (typically three-year) bachelor&#x27;s degree course first – and can be completed in either two or three years.

The City and Guilds of London Institute Licentiateship is awarded to those who achieve a level 4 Professional Recognition Award. Trinity College London formerly awarded licentiates, which were accredited at Level 6 of the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF).
The Landscape Institute offers licentiate membership to those who have completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a postgraduate diploma in the field of landscape architecture.

The College of Teachers also offers a licentiateship. This program, which is offered at the degree level, is for individuals with a BEd (three-year program) who wishes to do in-service advanced training in education or a related learning field. Also in education, Trinity College London awards the Licentiate Diploma in TESOL, commonly referred to as the Dip TESOL, an advanced teaching qualification in ESL at Level 7 of the NQF.

The Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies, based in Canterbury, Kent, has as its highest qualification (above Certificate, Higher Certificate and Diploma levels) the Licentiateship of the institute, awarded following both a course of study including thesis and dissertation and professional practice.

In music, a licentiate is the qualification which follows the diploma and is offered by Trinity College London (LTCL), Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (LRSM) and London College of Music (LLCM); candidates may choose to specialize in performance or teaching, depending on the examination board.

=== Venezuela ===
A &quot;Licenciatura&quot; is awarded to students after five years of study. They are required to write a thesis and/or do an internship and/or develop a research project in order to graduate.

== Pontifical universities and faculties ==

The licentiate degree is a post-graduate, research degree, considered above the master&#x27;s degree and below the research doctoral degree, conferred by authority of the Holy See by a pontifical university or ecclesiastical faculty upon completion of studies in one of the sacred sciences. The pontifical licentiate is a canonical pre-requisite for entrance into a pontifical doctoral program: &quot;Nobody can be admitted to the doctorate unless first having obtained the licentiate.&quot; The licentiate may be conferred in any of the sacred sciences, including theology, philosophy or canon law, such as the Licentiate of Canon Law (JCL), the Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL), or the Licentiate of Philosophy (PhL). Pontifical universities and Catholic Universities with Ecclesiastical Faculties such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Gregorian University, Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, Pontifical Athenaeum of Sant&#x27;Anselmo, Pontifical Salesian University, Pontifical University of Antonianum, Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome, the Pontifical University of Salamanca in Spain, the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila (Philippines), The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, University of Saint Mary of the Lake in Mundelein, IL, and Regis College in Toronto, Canada all confer such degrees. The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto awards a licentiate in Mediaeval studies, but, unusually, only offers it as a postdoctoral degree. (Cf. the Canada section above.) Further, the licentiate degree also grants the holder the &quot;licence&quot; to teach at any Catholic university, seminary or pontifical faculty anywhere around the world.

== Heraldry ==
In Canada, anyone who completes the Level III Heraldic Proficiency Courses is granted the right to use the post-nominal of LRHSC (Licentiate of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada). This is awarded by the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada.

== Medicine, surgery and obstetrics ==

=== Canada ===
A medical graduate must obtain the qualification of Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada from the Medical Council of Canada before they are eligible to apply for licensure in the province or territory concerned.

=== Great Britain ===
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP) is awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of London.
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons (LRCS), previously Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) is awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of England.
* Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery of the Society of Apothecaries (LMSSA) is awarded by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London.
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCPE) is awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (LRCSEd) is awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (LRCPSG) is awarded by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.

These Conjoint diplomas were latterly awarded by the United Examining Board. The first two, and latterly the first three, were granted together in England, and the last three in Scotland, until 1999, after which approval to hold the examinations was withdrawn. The qualifications are still registrable with the General Medical Council, and allow the bearer to practice medicine in the United Kingdom, and used to be recognised by some state medical boards in the United States.

The Licentiate of Apothecaries&#x27; Hall (LAH) was a similar qualifying medical diploma awarded externally in Dublin until recognition was lost in 1968.

These licentiate diplomas were awarded by professional bodies, and were accepted by the General Medical Council for registration as a medical practitioner, but were not university degrees and were regarded as being at a slightly lower level than bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, licensed medical practitioners (physicians and surgeons) are either licentiates or doctorates, where the Licentiate of Medicine is the minimum qualification. In terms of degree coursework, the licentiate is above master&#x27;s but below a doctorate. In the medical field, there is no master&#x27;s degree, and the bachelor&#x27;s degree qualifies only for practical training to become a licentiate. Qualified licentiates may continue studies to become a Doctor of Medicine if they want to work in research.

=== Hong Kong ===

Medical graduates from schools outside of Hong Kong must obtain a medical license directly form the Medical Council of Hong Kong before they are able to register to practice medicine in Hong Kong. The qualification is known as the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (LMCHK). The LMCHK is awarded after such doctors undergo careful vetting, passing the HKMLE exam, and completing a period of assessment. The licentiate doctors are represented by an independent, non-profit professional body, known as the Licentiate Society.

=== Ireland ===
In Dublin, students at the School of Medicine of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland still qualify with licentiate diplomas from the two Irish Royal Colleges, coupled with a Licence in Midwifery from each, although in the past few years they have also been awarded the three medical bachelor&#x27;s degrees of the National University of Ireland:
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (LRCPI) or (L &amp; LM, RCPI) and
* Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (LRCSI) or (L &amp; LM, RCSI).

Certain maternity hospitals in Dublin used to award a Licentiate in Midwifery or LM diploma, not to midwives but to qualified medical practitioners who had been examined there after a three-month residential appointment. The Rotunda Hospital was the most recent to do so.
* Licenciate of the Royal Academy of Music is awarded by the Royal Academy of Music.
* Licentiate Member of the Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate (post nominal LICWCI) is a professional grade of the Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate, the professional body that supports quality construction and compliance of building standards through inspection.
* Licentiate of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development is a part qualified professional grade of the Chartered Institute of Personnel &amp; Development (CIPD). Prior to the Institute gaining its Royal Charter, members at this grade were able to use the post nominal Lic IPD after their names.

== Theology, canon law, history, and cultural patrimony ==

The degree of Licentiate of Theology (LTh) is a theological qualification commonly awarded for ordinands and laymen studying theology in the United Kingdom, Malta, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

A qualification similar to the LTh is the two-year postgraduate Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL), available from many Pontifical universities and Pontifical faculties of theology, possessing the authority to grant Pontifical degrees. This compares with, for example in North American institutions, the four-year program for a B.A. at many universities, a two-year program for an MA, and the writing and successful defense of the doctoral dissertation for the PhD, Th.D., or STD (an additional two to three years).

The degree of Licentiate of Canon Law (JCL) is similarly awarded at Pontifical universities and faculties. Other qualifications for canon law include an inter-denominational LLM program at least one university (Cardiff), though this degree would not have canonical effects in the Roman Catholic Church.

The Faculty of the History and the Cultural Patrimony of the Church at the Gregorian University also awards the Licentiate in the History of the Church, and the Licentiate in the Cultural Patrimony of the Church.

== Bologna Process ==
In 2003, the European Union organized the Bologna Convention for the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention, more commonly known as the Bologna Process, in order to create uniform standards across the European Union in university education. The resulting conclusions called for all European universities to change their degree programs to a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a master&#x27;s degree.

<text>Urban Arcana is a campaign setting for the d20 Modern roleplaying game that builds on a small campaign model included in the original rulebook. It adds much in the way of magic and monsters to the game, and contains rules for things such as playing Shadowkind characters.

==History==
The core book for Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;d20 Modern Roleplaying Game&quot; (2002) included information on the modern day fantasy setting &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;. Wizards later developed this into a full setting sourcebook of its own: the &quot;Urban Arcana Campaign Setting&quot; (2003).

==Description==
In the world of &quot;Urban Arcana&quot;, dragons rule the boardrooms and bugbears rule the streets. It is a world where monsters and magic exist, yet the human psyche just cannot fathom them and covers up all supernatural events. Some, however, break that barrier and become aware of the world around them and help Mages, Acolytes, and other magical characters fight with monsters from another realm.

<doc id="977290" wikidata="Q8069636" url="?curid=977290" title="Zeroman">
<text>Zeroman is a Canadian animated television series produced by Amberwood Entertainment that aired on the Canadian cartoon network Teletoon (in English) and on Télétoon (in French). It tells the adventures of incompetent sixty-three-year-old postman Les Mutton (voiced by Leslie Nielsen) who also happens to be the superhero known as Zeroman. As Zeroman, Les fights the crime that plagues Fair City in a similar fashion to Nielsen&#x27;s Lieutenant Frank Drebin character in the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series.

==Premise==
The Zerosuit grants its wearer invulnerability (although not completely, especially in areas like the solar plexus where the weave is thinner), flight (taking to the air with a cry of &quot;Out, Out and Away!&quot; apparently through a form of super-flatulence), superhuman strength and various other abilities, including shooting sticky glue-like super-mucus out of his nose when his allergies get particularly bad as in the episode &quot;The Humidifier&quot;. But, even though the suit grants its user incredible power, the suit is susceptible to anti-static sheets. When affected by them, the suit wearer is incapacitated, handicapped and put through immense pain as the suit begins to bulge uncontrollably.

Most of the characters are actually modeled after their voice actors. Les/Zeroman, Ty, Rusty, Don and Ron all share many resemblances to their real-life counterparts (Reynolds, who voiced Ty, used to have a moustache).

==Characters==
Les Mutton/Zeroman: Played by Leslie Nielsen, Les comes into the possession of an alien supersuit that grants the wearer superpowers, turning him into Fair City&#x27;s hero, Zeroman. When not fighting crime, Les Mutton is an absent-minded and mild-mannered postman who still lives with his mother at the age of sixty-three. Zeroman maintains his secret identity similar to Superman but in reverse, whereas Les doesn&#x27;t wear glasses and Zeroman does (the Zero-Specs are also a highly advanced communication system that allows him to keep in constant contact with Ty). Even though it&#x27;s quite obvious that the two are the same person, the people of Fair City (with the exception of Ty and Gary) cannot seem to tell the difference and would even go as far as telling Les otherwise whenever his cover would be blown. Zeroman&#x27;s secret hideout is located under his mother&#x27;s shabby suburban house. The main secret entrance is via the toilet in his washroom, and when activated by jiggling the handle and allowing the seat to scan his bum print, it sends Les down the &quot;Poop-Chute&quot; through a network of tunnels to the caverns of his base. While not explained in detail, Les&#x27; father was a secret agent (the Zero-Specs were originally one of his spy gadgets). Les has romantic feelings for his co-worker, Sally, but can never really express them to her and seems unaware that she actually reciprocates them. Les is quite neurotic and not very bright with a tendency to misunderstand just about everything that is said to him, and his natural clumsiness, augmented by his cheerful obliviousness, is magnified to incredible proportions by the suit, but he is brave and good-hearted and is dedicated to fighting the forces of evil. He also has a strong love of his mother and goes into fetal position muttering &quot;Mommy, mommy, mommy&quot; when she gets kidnapped (referred as &quot;Mommy go bye-bye syndrome&quot; by Ty).

Jaundice Mutton (Les Mutton&#x27;s Mother): Jaundice Mutton simply wants her son to finally move out of the house and get married. She is a cruel and bitter old woman who is constantly annoyed at her inept son. Jaundice is also Zeroman&#x27;s #1 fan, where the irony comes in as she simply loathes her son but is head over heels for his alter-ego, in the episode &quot;Smotherly Love&quot; taking the hero hostage like in the Stephen King novel/movie &quot;Misery&quot;. Les&#x27; mother is played by Doris Roberts.

Ty Cheese: Ty Cheese is a former secret agent who aids Zeroman in his fight against the evil-doers of Fair City. Ty provides Zeroman with technological and intelligence support as well as giving the inept hero the constant guidance and advice he so desperately needs because, as he says, &quot;Ty is always right&quot;. He is implicitly gay. Ty was briefly the feline superhero Hellcat with Gary as his bovine sidekick Holy Cow when Zeroman was out of town at a hero convention in the episode &quot;Peace Off&quot;. Ty is played by Ryan Reynolds.

Sally Uberchick: Sally is Les&#x27; much younger co-worker and love interest. She has strong feelings for Les and is always waiting for him to make a move, but he never does because he is always called to action during their moments together. Sally is also known to be Zeroman&#x27;s &quot;main squeeze&quot; by the people of Fair City, even though she constantly denies it as there is truly nothing going on between them. This gossip, of course, puts her in danger many times.

Gary Glengarry/O-Boy: Gary as O-Boy is Zeroman&#x27;s obnoxious but loyal ten-year-old sidekick-in-training, constantly getting into arguments with Ty over their mission and willing to use any means necessary, including sabotage, to get his chance to be an actual full-fledged superhero. An orphan who, despite his ambition, looks upon Zeroman as the father figure he never had, Gary is a boy millionaire who provides the financial backing for the team as well as a host of gadgets and other advanced technology that never seems to work properly.

Rusty Woodenwater: Rusty Woodenwater is a former child star turned criminal mastermind. Rusty was once the most loved television personality of Fair City until he entered puberty.He had his first acne outbreak on-air during his show, which resulted in the eventual cancellation of his show and the decline of his career, ending when he was booed off his show. After falling from grace, Rusty went from being famous to becoming Fair City&#x27;s most dangerous supervillain. The Zerosuit was also originally made for Rusty, which resulted in many failed attempts at trying to retrieve it from Zeroman. Even though he is an evil genius and criminal mastermind, Rusty on occasion throws fits and tantrums, and he has his henchmen Don and Ron do his dirty work due to basically being ineffectual as a villain. And like his nemesis Zeroman, he also has a poor relationship with his mother. Rusty&#x27;s most distinguishing characteristics are his mullet-cut red hair and his annoyingly shrill voice. Kevin McDonald provides the voice of Rusty.

Don: Don is Rusty&#x27;s former manager turned henchman. He is dressed up as a 1940s style gangster, with a tough, no-nonsense attitude and the catchphrase &quot;Ba-wango!&quot;. He is modeled after former NHL coach and hockey personality Don Cherry, who also provides the voice for him.

Ron: Ron is Rusty&#x27;s former publicist turned henchman, often serving as a whipping boy for his ill-tempered companions. Like Don, Ron is modeled after and voiced by hockey personality Ron MacLean.

Mayor Todd MacWadd: He is the friendly and naïve mayor of Fair City who issues the order to summon Zeroman when needed via a catapult on top of City Hall which launches the &quot;Great Flaming Holes!&quot; (huge truck tires which have been set on fire) off into the sky in random directions, usually causing damage to property throughout the surrounding city when they crash to the ground.

Helga: Helga is the corrupt police chief of Fair City who is in love with Rusty, giving him aid and comfort with his criminal schemes. She is a large woman with a Russian accent.

In November 2010, Ofcom approved a request to share programming across all four stations, stating the changes &quot;would not substantially alter the character of the service.&quot;

==Programming==
All programming on the station is produced from Total Sense Media studios in Hickstead and shared with More Radio Hastings, More Radio Eastbourne, More Radio Mid Sussex and More Radio Worthing with opt-outs for local news and advertising.

Local news airs every hour from 6am to 6pm on weekdays and from 8am to 12pm on Saturdays with headlines on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows. National news bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried hourly at all other times.

<doc id="977315" wikidata="Q7793450" url="?curid=977315" title="Thomas Rees (Unitarian)">
<text>Thomas Rees (17771 August 1864), Welsh Nonconformist divine, was a Unitarian minister and scholar.

Rees was educated at the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen. He entered the Unitarian ministry in 1807 at the Newington Green Unitarian Church, London. He went to Southwark in 1813, earned the degree of LL.D. of Glasgow in 1819, and went to Stamford Street, Blackfriars, in 1823.

He had great knowledge of the history of anti-trinitarian opinion, especially of the 16th century. He published papers, chiefly in the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot; between 1818 and 1822, on such subjects as Faustus Socinus and Francis David, including &quot;The Italian Reformation, Memoirs of the Socini.&quot; Financial troubles drove him to Spain in 1853, and he died in obscurity in Brighton.

==Life==
He was born in Gelligron, Glamorgan, the son of Josiah Rees; George Owen Rees was his nephew. He started in the bookselling business, but on the advice of Abraham Rees (no relation), he was educated for the ministry (1799–1801) at Carmarthen College.

In 1807 Rees became afternoon preacher at Newington Green Chapel, London, of which he had sole charge from 1808 to 1813, when he moved to St. Thomas&#x27;s Chapel, Southwark, which was closed in 1822. On 12 October 1823 a new chapel was opened in Stamford Street, Blackfriars, London, built from the proceeds of the sales of St. Thomas&#x27;s Chapel and the chapel in Prince&#x27;s Street, Westminster. Here Rees ministered till 1831, when he ceased to hold regular ministerial charge.

Rees was a fellow of the Society of Arts, and received the degree of LL.D. in January 1819 from Glasgow University. He was a trustee of Dr. Williams&#x27;s Foundation from 1809 to 1853, a member of the Presbyterian board from 1813, its secretary from 1825 to 1853, and some time secretary of the London Unitarian Society.

From 1828 to 1835 he was secretary to the London union of ministers of the &quot;three denominations&quot;. His rejection in 1835 was resented by the unitarians, who claimed to represent the Presbyterians, from whom the secretary had until then been chosen. They seceded from the union, and obtained the separate privilege of presenting addresses to the throne. Rees in 1837 was appointed by government as principal receiver of the English &quot;regium donum&quot;, on the nomination of the three denominations.

In 1853 Rees left England for Spain, being unable to meet charges in regard to trust funds; but ultimately he made full restitution. He died in obscurity at Brighton, on 1 August 1864. His wife, Elizabeth, died at Hythe on 20 August 1856.

==Works==
Rees made a collection of the literature of antitrinitarian opinion, especially during the 16th century. His intention, announced by 1833, of publishing a comprehensive work, was never fulfilled; the &quot;Antitrinitarian Biography&quot; by Robert Wallace appeared in 1850.

For &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; he contributed articles on biography, various miscellaneous topics, and examined and described the plates.

Rees published, besides single sermons (1804–46):

* &quot;The Beauties of South Wales&quot;, 1815 (see Edward Wedlake Brayley). 
* The &quot;Racovian Catechism&quot; in Latin translation; with a prefixed &quot;Sketch of the History of Unitarianism in Poland&quot;, 1818.
* &quot;A Sketch of the History of the Regium Donum&quot;, 1834.

His historical papers included:

* &quot;Faustus Socinus and Francis David&quot; in the &quot;Monthly Repository&quot; (as were the next three), 1818;
* &quot;On the Sentiments of the Early Continental Reformers respecting Religious Liberty&quot; (1819); 
* &quot;Italian Reformation&quot; (1822); 
* &quot;Memoirs of the Socini&quot; (1827); and
* &quot;Calvin and Servetus&quot;, in the &quot;Christian Reformer&quot;, 1847.

Rees left in manuscript &quot;The Anti-papal Reformers of Italy in the Sixteenth Century, with a Glance at their Forerunners, the Sectaries of the Middle Ages&quot;, in six volumes; also a manuscript translation, with notes, of Orelli&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of Lælius Socinus. His promised memoir of Abraham Rees never appeared.

<text>102 Touch FM was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the town of Stratford-upon-Avon and much of the counties of Warwickshire, Worcestershire, The Cotswolds and the surrounding area in the south of the English Midlands.

==History==
The station, which launched in 1996 as FM102 The Bear and was later known as The Bear 102, was taken over by Cumbria-based CN Group in 2001 and relaunched, along with Kix 96 in Coventry, as Touch FM on 16 January 2006.

In June 2009, the Touch Radio Network of stations (together with Rugby FM) were purchased from CN Group by Quidem Midlands Limited. 102 Touch Radio was then re-branded to 102 Touch FM.

In March 2011, Touch FM and Quidem were nominated for two Sony Radio Academy Awards – &quot;The First Break Show&quot; in the Best Specialist Music programme category and the &quot;Coventry Blitz Special&quot; in the Best News Special category . The station won the Radio Academy Nations &amp; Regions Award for the Midlands Station of the Year in 2012-13 and 2013–14 and was nominated for the Sony Radio Academy Awards Station of the Year in 2013. Touch FM&#x27;s Pride of Stratford Awards won the Arqiva Commercial Radio marketing award in 2012.

In September 2019, Quidem announced it had entered a brand licensing agreement with Global, citing financial losses. Two months later, following permission from regulator, Ofcom to change the station&#x27;s format, it was confirmed Touch FM (Stratford-upon-Avon) would merge with its Quidem-owned sister stations and launch as Capital Mid-Counties on 2 December 2019.

Local output for the Mid-Counties region consists of a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Touch FM ceased broadcasting at 7pm on Friday 29 November 2019.

<doc id="977323" wikidata="Q977786" url="?curid=977323" title="Soul II Soul">
<text>Soul II Soul are a British musical collective formed in London in 1988. They are best known for their two major hits; 1989&#x27;s UK number five and US number eleven &quot;Keep On Movin&#x27;&quot;, and its follow-up, the UK number one and US number four &quot;Back to Life&quot;. They have won two Grammy Awards, and have been nominated for five Brit Awards—twice for Best British Group.

==Career==
===1988–1989: Beginnings and club classics===
The group initially attracted attention as a sound system some years prior to 1988 run by founder Jazzie B, playing at nights including their own at the Africa Centre, London.

By 1988, the official lineup was Jazzie B, Caron Wheeler, Nellie Hooper, Simon Law, Doreen Waddell, Rose Windross, Daddae, Aitch B, and Jazzie Q. They released their first single, &quot;Fairplay&quot;, with Rose Windross on lead vocals, recorded at the Africa Centre. where the collective hosted a regular Sunday-night residency. The song charted at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart, while their follow-up single &quot;Feel Free&quot;, which featured Doreen on lead vocals, charted at number 64.

The weekly club night, having grown ever more popular, moved to the much larger The Fridge Nightclub in Brixton, South London, where it would remain well into the 1990s. The collective used the venue to test their musical composites on the dance floor. Together with an eclectic mix of “Funki Dredd&quot; – &quot;A happy face, a thumpin&#x27; bass, for a lovin&#x27; race!&quot; – themed club classics that combined British, Caribbean, African, and African American influences. One night in 1988, the residency hosted a personal appearance by the nascent rap group N.W.A. who were briefly in the UK promoting their album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.

At The Fridge nightclub, Soul II Soul helped cement club culture and lay the visual and musical template for the 1988 Second Summer of Love in the UK and Ibiza. Together with the nascent UK Dance Music movement originating both there and at venues like The Haçienda in Manchester, and Cream in Liverpool and on to the massive 1990s legal rave scene at club nights, venues and festivals all across the UK, Ibiza and Europe. Ultimately leading to the global electronic dance music (EDM) explosion of the new millennium. A plaque now commemorates the collective&#x27;s significant influence on the original venue, which closed in 2010 but which was subsequently renamed and reopened as the Electric Brixton

During the late 1980s, Jazzie B and several other members of the group became involved in the local pirate radio station movement. Jazzie B hosted a show on KISS-FM.

In March 1989, their label released the group&#x27;s single &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;, featuring Caron Wheeler on lead vocals. The song became a success and also sold over one million copies in the US. The following month, the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Club Classics Vol. One&quot; was released. The album peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart and sold over four million copies worldwide. The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Back to Life&quot;, became their biggest hit, hitting the top five on the US Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles chart. The single went on to win the group their first Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1990. The group would continue to see some UK success but &quot;Back to Life&quot; would be the second and last US hit for the group.

In late 1989, Waddell and Windross departed from the group. Marcia Lewis, a cousin of Jazzie B, joined the group. The single &quot;Get a Life&quot;, which featured Lewis on lead vocals, charted at number three on the UK Singles chart. The song also sold over 60 thousand copies in the United Kingdom. Lewis&#x27; debut performance came on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; when she performed alongside Caron Wheeler and Jazzie B.

===1990: &quot;Volume II A New Decade&quot; and lineup changes===
In early 1990, Wheeler officially left the group to pursue her solo career. To fill out the group&#x27;s dynamic, Jazzie B turned to a few singers he had performed with in the past. This led to the brief addition of Kym Mazelle, Lamya, and Victoria Wilson-James to the new lineup. With a new official lineup, the group released their second album, &quot;Vol. II: 1990 – A New Decade&quot;, which peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;A Dreams a Dream&quot;, which features Victoria Wilson James on lead vocals, performed well on the chart. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;People&quot;, featuring Lewis on lead vocals, garnered moderate success on the charts but managed to achieve success on the Dance charts. The album&#x27;s final single &quot;Missing You&quot;, featuring Kym Mazelle on lead vocals, also performed well on the charts. In the mid-1990s, the group toured throughout the United Kingdom. One of their concerts at Brixton Academy was recorded live and released in September 1990, titled &quot;A New Decade: Live from Brixton Academy&quot;. After the conclusion of the tour, Wilson-James, Mazelle, Lewis left the group to pursue solo careers.

===1991–1993: &quot;Volume III Just Right&quot; and another lineup change===
In 1991, Soul II Soul was in need of lead vocalists for the recording of their third album. During recording sessions, Jazzie B recruited guest singers Richie Stephens, Kofi, Penny Ford, Rick Clarke, along with the re-addition of Caron Wheeler to record on the album.

In April 1992, Soul II Soul released their third album, &quot;Volume III Just Right&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Joy&quot;, performed by Stephens, reached the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up single &quot;Move Me No Mountain&quot;, performed by Kofi on lead vocals, achieved moderate success in the UK. The third single, &quot;Just Right&quot;, suffered the same fate, relegating the album to limited and moderate sales figures.

The group toured for a brief time throughout 1993. In November 1993, the group released their greatest hits album &quot;Volume IV The Classic Singles 88–93&quot;. The album spawned the single &quot;Wish&quot;, which featured the new addition to the group Melissa Bell on lead vocals.

===1994–1997: &quot;Volume V Believe&quot;, lineup changes, &quot;Time for Change&quot;===
In 1994, Soul II Soul prepared to record their fourth album. Despite her career as an established solo artist, Caron Wheeler once again joined the group and committed to the recording of the group&#x27;s upcoming album. During the record sessions, Wheeler and Jazzie B struggled with creative difficulties for the production of the album. This ultimately led to Wheeler leaving the group again during the recording of the song &quot;Love Enuff&quot;. Now without an official lead singer for the group, Jazzie B was left to recruit a few singers once more. Penny Ford, background vocalist on the group&#x27;s single &quot;Move Me No Mountain&quot;, officially became a member of the group. Charlotte Kelly, a background vocalist from the group&#x27;s previous tour, was also recruited to join the group. Melissa Bell and Lamya also contributed vocals to the forthcoming album.

In January 1995, Soul II Soul and Isaac Hayes also performed &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; live on French TV show &quot;Taratata&quot;, with Kelly on lead vocals. In June 1995, Soul II Soul released the single &quot;Love Enuff&quot;. The single retained the use of Wheeler&#x27;s pre-recorded background vocals and Penny Ford on lead vocals. The song invited Soul II Soul to perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with Ford performing lead vocals. In August 1995, Soul II Soul released their fourth studio album, &quot;Volume V Believe&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;I Care&quot;, which features Charlotte on lead vocals, charted at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart.

In August 1997, the group released their fifth studio album, &quot;Time for Change&quot;. The album featured the singles &quot;Represent&quot; and &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;.

===1998–2006: Disbandment and aftermath===
In 1997, Daddae teamed up with Joey Jay and Norman Jay to produce the roots reggae dub reggae album &quot;I n I Deal With Roots&quot; under the collective moniker, The Truth, which was successful with Jah Shaka followers. The album reworked drum and bass structures and production techniques from King Tubby, Prince Alla,Yabby You, Big Youth&#x27;s iconic &quot;Screaming Target&quot; album, as well as sampling bass lines from The Palmer Brothers &quot;Step it Out of Babylon&quot; In 1998, the group officially disbanded with each member pursuing solo careers. Following their disbandment, several members including Wilson-James, Mazelle, Lamya, and Kelly would release solo albums which would each garner success, respectively. Marcia Lewis and Kym Mazelle would also go on to become educators. In 1999, Kelly released her self-titled debut album, which spawned the number-one Dance chart single &quot;Skin&quot;. The group often reunited and performed for a few selected dates over the course of their hiatus.

In March 2002, Doreen Waddell, who had been living in Hove following her departure, died at 36 after being hit by three cars while she was fleeing from a shoplifting incident. In July 2002, Lamya released her solo debut album &quot;Learning from Falling&quot;, which spawned the number-one Dance chart single &quot;Empires (Bring Me Men)&quot;.

===2007–2012: Reunion===
In 2007, Soul II Soul reformed at the Lovebox Festival in Victoria Park, London. The lineup consisted of Caron Wheeler, Jazzie B, Aitch B, with the new addition of MC Chickaboo. In December 2008, a radio programme about Soul II Soul was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. In January 2009, Lamya died of a heart attack.

The group toured until the end of 2011. Following the tour, Kelly and Wheeler performed on-and-off as the featured vocalists for Soul II Soul. In 2012, Soul II Soul performed at the Lovebox Festival in which Kelly performed as the featured vocalist. In June 2012, Soul II Soul received the honorary PRS Heritage Plaque award. Jazzie B, Wheeler, Daddae, Mazelle, Kelly, Aitch B were among the members present. They also performed during the ceremony.

<text>Kessel-Lo () is a sub-municipality of the city of Leuven located in the province of Flemish Brabant, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1977. On 1 January 1977, it was merged into Leuven.

== Etymology ==
Its name is derived from &quot;Kessel&quot; (from the Latin &quot;Castellum&quot; for &quot;fortress&quot;, referring to a fortress that once stood on the Kessel mountain) and &quot;Lo&quot; (&quot;forest clearing&quot;).

== Culture ==
Kessel-Lo is home to the Provinciaal Domein Kessel-Lo, a large provincial park with ponds, playgrounds, soccer fields, Tennis courts, fishing and other areas for recreational activities. It also has an &#x27;Ecocentrum&#x27; which is the starting point for all activities around nature and environmental education. The town has nice smaller public parks such as Park Bellevue, Heuvelhof and Park Michotte and is also known for Vlierbeek Abbey, an old Benedictine abbey built in 1125.

Several youth organisations are present in Kessel-Lo, such as Chiro Don Bosco, Chiro Vlierbeek, Scouts Vlierbeek, Chiro Blauwput, Chiro Hekeko, Scouts De Vlievleger and Scouts Boven-lo.

A local brewery has recently been founded called &quot;De Vlier&quot;. They brew a blond beer called &quot;Kessel&#x27;s Blond&quot;.

=== Sport ===
Kessel-Lo is also the proud home of the Rugby Club Leuven and Thijs Vandebon and Teun Vandermeulen.

<text>The Beach was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft areas. It used to broadcast from studios in Norwich and Ipswich. Before that it broadcast from studios at the junction of Hollingsworth Road and Oulton Road, in Lowestoft, Suffolk until 8 January 2017 when it was transferred to central hubs in Norwich and Ipswich along with sister stations.

==History==
In 1993 and 1994, three restricted service licences in Lowestoft were operated and run by local radio volunteers, including some freelance radio professionals, with proceeds being donated to local charities. The station was called &quot;Lowestoft Town Radio&quot; (LTR-fm). LTR presenters included Martyn Lee, Steve Smart and his co-presenter at the time, Matt Denny. Following 30-day trial broadcasts, along with similar efforts in Great Yarmouth, The Radio Authority (now Ofcom) created a new licence for the area. They granted the licence to the group behind the LTR, re-branded as &quot;The Beach&quot;.

The Beach started broadcasting on Sunday 29 September 1996. It has been voted The Eastern Region Radio Academy Station Of The Year three times.

It formerly broadcast from studios at the junction of Hollingsworth Road and Oulton Road, in Lowestoft, Suffolk until 8 January 2017 when it was transferred to central hubs in Norwich and Ipswich along with sister stations.

From 9 January 2017, all 103.4 The Beach&#x27;s programming was shared with North Norfolk Radio, Town 102, Dream 100 and Radio Norwich 99.9, although the five stations kept separate branding (particularly for local travel, events, news, adverts and commercials) with programmes broadcast from the studios in Ipswich and Norwich.

On 31 January 2017, it was confirmed that Celador had completed the purchase of the Anglian Radio group.

==Station closure==
On 8 February 2019, The Beach and Celador&#x27;s local radio stations were sold to Bauer. The sale was ratified in March 2020 following an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority.

On 27 May 2020, it was announced that The Beach will join Bauer&#x27;s Greatest Hits Radio network.

On 13 July 2020, local programming outside weekday breakfast was replaced by networked output from the GHR network, with The Beach retaining its own branding.

The station was gradually rebranded, with the stations RDS being changed on 25 August 2020 to &#x27;Grt Hits&#x27; from its original RDS. On 28 August 2020 the station broadcast its last local breakfast show and on 1 September 2020, the station rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio East. The station&#x27;s local breakfast show was replaced by a regional drivetime show with its current sister stations. Localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained. The station&#x27;s Norwich studios were retained.

==Transmission==
Transmitters are located at Mobbs Way, Oulton Broad on 103.4 FM and on 97.4 FM from a transmitter located at a water tower in Blythburgh, Suffolk. A second transmitter on 97.4 FM is located at Havenbridge House office block in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

<text>Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria (formerly The Bay) was an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcast to north Lancashire and south Cumbria from studios in Lancaster.

==History==
===The Bay===
The station&#x27;s original name, The Bay, derived from the sand banks of Morecambe Bay, above which the main 96.9 MHz transmitter is located. Relay transmitters are located near the Lake District towns of Windermere (102.3 MHz) and Kendal (103.2 MHz), near the A684.

The station served a potential audience of around 292,000 people, including the key centres of Barrow-in-Furness, Kendal, Lancaster, Morecambe and Windermere, where the service area overlaps with sister station Smooth Lake District.

Under previous owners, The Bay was nominated for and won several industry awards, including the Station of the Year at the 2010 Arqiva Commercial Radio Awards, and more recently, Arqiva&#x27;s Breakfast Show of the Year in 2012.

===Sale and rebrand===
On 20 November 2017, CN Group announced The Bay would be sold to Global along with sister station Lakeland Radio - the sale was finalised by 1 December 2017. Global later announced The Bay would join the Heart network.

The Bay&#x27;s brand and programming was phased out during February 2018 and following a transition period, the station was relaunched as Heart North Lancashire and Cumbria at 6am on Monday 5 March 2018.

===Closure===
On 26 February 2019, Global announced the station would be merged with Heart North West. From 3 June 2019, local output will consist of a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria&#x27;s studios in Lancaster closed with operations moving to Manchester. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London. The station ceased local programming on 31 May 2019.

<doc id="977333" wikidata="Q853472" url="?curid=977333" title="Sakamoto family murder">
<text>On November 5, 1989, Tsutsumi Sakamoto (坂本 堤 &quot;Sakamoto Tsutsumi&quot; April 6, 1956 – November 5, 1989), a lawyer working on a class action lawsuit against Aum Shinrikyo, a doomsday cult in Japan, was murdered, along with his wife Satoko and his child Tatsuhiko, by perpetrators who broke into his apartment. Six years later, following the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway, the murderers were uncovered and it was established that the murderers had been members of Aum Shinrikyo at the time of the crime.

==Tsutsumi Sakamoto==
Tsutsumi was born in Yokosuka, Kanagawa. After graduating from Yokosuka High School, he entered Tokyo University and graduated in law. He worked as a law clerk until he passed the bar exam in 1984 at age 27. He was a member of the Yokohama Bar Association. From 1987 he worked as a lawyer at Yokohama Law Offices.

At the time of his murder, Sakamoto was known as an anti-cult lawyer. He had previously successfully led a class-action suit against the Unification Church on behalf of relatives of Unification Church members. In the suit the plaintiffs sued for assets transferred to the group, and for harm inflicted by worsened family relationships. A public relations campaign in which protesters demanded public attention to their cause was instrumental to Sakamoto&#x27;s plan, and the Unification Church suffered a serious financial blow.

By organizing a similar anti-Aum public relations campaign, Sakamoto apparently sought to demonstrate that Aum members, similar to members of the Unification Church, did not join the group voluntarily but were lured in by deception and were probably being held against their will by threats and manipulations. Furthermore, religious items were being sold at prices far greater than their market value, draining money out of the households of members (in a practice called spiritual sales). If a judgment was handed down in his clients&#x27; favor, Aum could be bankrupted, thus greatly weakening or destroying the group.

In 1988, in order to pursue the class action suit, Sakamoto initiated the establishment of &quot;Aum Shinrikyo Higai Taisaku Bengodan&quot; (&quot;Coalition of Help for those affected by Aum Shinrikyo&quot;). This was later renamed: &quot;Aum Shinrikyo Higaisha-no-kai&quot; or &quot;Aum Shinrikyo Victims&#x27; Association&quot;. The group still operated under this title .

After Sakamoto&#x27;s disappearance, lawyer Taro Takimoto took over most of his anti-Aum Shinrikyo legal activities.

==Circumstances of the murder==
In October 1989, Tokyo Broadcasting System Television (TBS) taped an interview with Sakamoto regarding his anti-Aum efforts. However, the network secretly showed a video of the interview to Aum members without Sakamoto&#x27;s knowledge, intentionally breaking its protection of sources. Aum officials then pressured TBS to cancel the planned broadcast of the interview.

Several days later, on November 3, 1989, several Aum Shinrikyo members, including Hideo Murai, chief scientist, Satoro Hashimoto, a martial arts master, Tomomasa Nakagawa and Kazuaki Okazaki drove to Yokohama, where Sakamoto lived. They carried a pouch with 14 hypodermic needles and a supply of potassium chloride. According to court testimony provided by the perpetrators later, they planned to use the chemical substance to kidnap Sakamoto from Yokohama&#x27;s Shinkansen train station, but, contrary to expectations, he did not show up—it was a holiday (&quot;Bunka no hi&quot;, or &quot;Culture Day&quot;), so he slept in with his family at home.

At 3 a.m. on November 5, the group entered Sakamoto&#x27;s apartment through an unlocked door. Tsutsumi Sakamoto was struck on the head with a hammer, injected with potassium chloride, and strangled. His wife, Satoko Sakamoto (坂本都子 &quot;Sakamoto Satoko&quot;, 29 years old) was beaten and injected with potassium chloride. Their infant son Tatsuhiko Sakamoto (坂本竜彦 &quot;Sakamoto Tatsuhiko&quot;, 14 months old) was injected with the potassium chloride and then his face was covered with a cloth. The family&#x27;s remains were placed in metal drums and hidden in three separate rural areas in three different prefectures (Tsutsumi in Niigata, Satoko in Toyama, and Tatsuhiko in Nagano) so that in case the bodies were uncovered, police might not link the three incidents. Their bed sheets were burned and the tools were dropped in the ocean. The victims&#x27; teeth were smashed to frustrate identification. Their bodies were not found until the perpetrators revealed the locations after they were captured in connection with the 1995 Tokyo subway attack. By the time police searched the areas in which the victims were placed, their bodies were reduced to bones.

==Aftermath==
As reported by NHK in 2015, the Tokyo metropolitan police had received a tip that an Aum member was involved in the murder, and in 1991 launched an investigation into the cult&#x27;s facilities in the city. However, the investigation was shut down after two months due to the murder having been committed in Yokohama, outside of the jurisdiction of the Tokyo police.

Evidence of Aum Shinrikyo&#x27;s involvement in the murders was uncovered six years after the murder, after a number of senior followers were arrested on other charges, most notably in connection with the Tokyo subway attack. All of those implicated in the Sakamoto murders received death sentences. The court found that the murder was committed by order of the group&#x27;s founder, Shoko Asahara, although not all of the perpetrators testified to this effect, and Asahara denied involvement. Asahara&#x27;s legal team claims that blaming him is an attempt to shift personal responsibility to a higher authority.

After the culpability of Tokyo Broadcasting System in the murders was uncovered, the network was swamped with complaints and eventually the company&#x27;s president resigned.

==Trial, conviction, and sentencing of the perpetrators==
Following the Tokyo attacks, police charged Aum members Hideo Murai, Tomomasa Nakagawa, Kazuaki Okazaki, and Satoro Hashimoto with the murder of the Sakamoto family. Okazaki&#x27;s trial was the shortest, as he pleaded guilty to all charges. Murai never made it to trial, as he was stabbed to death by a Korean assassin in April 1995 as he was being transferred by police. Okazaki was found guilty in October 1998. In 2000, the last two perpetrators, Nakagawa and Hashimoto, were convicted of the murders. On July 25, 2000, Okazaki, Nakagawa, and Hashimoto were sentenced to death. On 28 July 2000, Kiyohide Hayakawa was sentenced to death for his role in the murder.

In 2017, Nakagawa published a memoir from prison in which he renounced his Aum beliefs, apologized to the families of his victims, and referred to Aum leader Shoko Asahara as a &quot;criminal&quot;.

Following the 2017 death of Kim Jong-nam (the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un), Nakagawa wrote a letter from prison in which he expressed his belief that Kim Jong-nam had died from VX poisoning, quantities of which Aum Shinrikyo had produced and used in the 1990s.

Nakagawa was executed on July 6, 2018, while Okazaki and Hashimoto were executed on July 26, 2018 (18 years and one day after being sentenced).

<doc id="977336" wikidata="Q7804897" url="?curid=977336" title="Time 106.8">
<text>Time 106.8 was an Independent Local Radio station located in the south-east London and north-west Kent area of England, which broadcast to Greenwich and Bexleyheath in London and Dartford and Gravesend in Kent on 106.8 FM, and ceased transmission in April 2009.

==Background==
The radio station originally broadcast as Radio Thamesmead using the local Rediffusion cable television system (channel L). It was financed originally by the Home Office, due to a fear of flooding before the Thames Barrier was finished and featured weekly alarm &#x27;rehearsals. The first studio was in the Ecumenical Centre and run by the Rev Patrick Forbes who presented a mainly classical music breakfast show. Nick Hennegan, broadcasting as Nick Mobbs, was a volunteer who took over the breakfast show after the Rev Forbes moved to another parish. Australian Frank Warren arrived back at his home in Thamesmead and worked with the voluntary sector to develop the station, turn it into a youth project and move to studios in Tavy Bridge. It was also broadcast in Greenwich for a time on a cable television service there. Towards the end of the 1980s, new management were brought in by the stations backers (the Community Service Volunteers NGO and Thamesmead Town company) with a view to campaigning and applying for a permanent broadcast (FM) license. The station was managed by Bob Smith (deceased) and David Stanley headed the engineering/technical side. An Incremental Radio license was applied for in 1989. One other applicant, Greenwich Community Radio Meridian applied, but Radio Thamesmead won the license which it had long campaigned for.

The volunteers of the radio station were given the opportunity to vote on a new name for the station. It was felt that the Thamesmead name should be dropped to reflect the much wider service area which covered a large part of south east London. RTM Radio was the name chosen by the majority.

Following upgrading of the station&#x27;s facilities to meet the IBA engineering code, the station commenced broadcasts from its existing studios at Tavy Bridge, Thamesmead, as RTM Radio transmitting on 103.8 F.M. Transmission was from Shooters Hill, one of the highest points in London. The station was the first broadcaster in the UK to use an independent company (Sound Broadcast Services) to provide its FM transmission systems.

The station negotiated a change in frequency from 103.8 to 106.8 MHz following persistent interference from BBC local radio transmissions from Bedfordshire. The station also changed from vertical polarisation to circular using a custom designed antenna from SBS.

RTM stayed at Tavy Bridge until moving to the Thamesmead Town offices in Harrow Manor Way during April 1994. The new studios and production facilities were designed and built in house by Frank de Pellette and Jon Lucas.

The station then moved to Basildon Road on the outskirts of Plumstead, sharing its premises with sister station South London Radio 107.3. By then, Time 106.8 was in the final five years of its life and was owned by the Sunrise Radio Group.

==History==

The station launched on the FM radio band as RTM Radio on 18 March 1990, having previously broadcast on the area&#x27;s local cable television service as Radio Thamesmead, and intended to fulfil a community-style remit, with any profits generated being invested in local regeneration projects. Prior to its full time license, the station operated the first FM Restricted Service License in the UK from 23 to 24 July 1988 on 104.3 MHz.

RTM changed its name to Millennium 106.8 in 1997, to link in with the upcoming celebrations at the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, having successfully amended its minority-orientated programming obligations with the Radio Authority. The station was put up for sale in June 1999, and was purchased by the Milestone Group in 2000. Fusion Radio Holdings later took reins of the station.

Millennium was rebranded as Time 106.8 at the beginning of 2003, in a move to associate the station with local town Greenwich&#x27;s connection with the Greenwich Meridian. Avtar Lit&#x27;s Sunrise Radio Group purchased the station in March 2004. A later decision was taken to rebrand other stations in the group under the same banner - of which only Time 107.5 in Romford continues to use the moniker.

==Performance and subsequent closure==

The station consistently struggled to perform in a highly competitive London market in terms of audience figures, with its market share steadily declining in RAJAR performance since the middle of 2005. In its final survey at the end of 2008, Time recorded an audience of 13,000 listeners, representing a market share of 1%.

In an unusual move, the Sunrise Radio Group put the station up for sale via a message on its website in mid-October 2008, and following disputed claims a buyer had been found, Time 106.8 ceased broadcasting at midnight on Saturday 4 April 2009.

<text>South London Radio was an Independent Local Radio station, previously known as FLR 107.3, Fusion 107.3 and Time 107.3, which ceased broadcasting in April 2009.

==Background==

Despite the geography of South London Radio&#x27;s coverage area, the station operated out of studios on Basildon Road on the outskirts of Plumstead, sharing its premises with sister station Time 106.8.

South London Radio was, in the final five years of its life, owned by the Sunrise Radio Group.

==Early history==

The station began life as FLR - &#x27;First Love Radio&#x27; - on 8 February 1999, broadcasting from studios in Astra House, New Cross, on the outskirts of Lewisham town centre, backed by the UKRD Group. Their official broadcast area was the London Borough of Lewisham but the signal stretched throughout much of south east London, from the Thames in the north, south west to Camberwell, south to Bromley, and east through Greenwich to Bexley. FLR targeted listeners aged 25 to 54 with a pop music playlist that reflected in particular the contemporary musical interests of the area&#x27;s black population, including soul, jazz, reggae and club music. Evening specialist shows were led by presenters knowledgeable in funk, gospel and African sounds. The station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Hot stuff south of the river&quot;.

Figures instrumental in the station&#x27;s foundation and the winning of its first commercial licence to broadcast were its chairman and noted community worker Sybil Phoenix OBE, founder Stella Headley and director John Shonubi. The first of several Restricted Service Licences were issued in 1992, when the station was broadcast from makeshift studios in Brockley. Guest of honour at the launch was Jeffrey Archer.

UKRD sold their stake in the company to Fusion Radio Holdings in April 2000. The transfer of ownership saw the station adopt a new moniker, Fusion 107.3, on 4 December that year.

Fusion Radio Holdings were purchased by the Milestone Group in April 2003, taking control of the former&#x27;s similarly named Fusion 107.9 station in Oxford, and adding a second operation to its portfolio of London-based radio stations - the first being Time 106.8, operating from studios in Plumstead.

The sale of Milestone&#x27;s London assets to the Sunrise Radio Group in February 2004 saw Fusion rebranded as Time 107.3, under the directorship of former Ten-17 FM and Dream 107.7 chief Gary Mulligan, with the intention to temporarily move the operation into office space at the group&#x27;s existing site in Plumstead, facilitating programming-sharing, which formed a significant part of the two stations&#x27; output for several months. Ofcom agreed to this &#x27;co-location arrangement&#x27; in March 2006, with the stations continuing to operate from premises outside its own service area, although programme sharing was ended.

==Ofcom Yellow Card==

On 17 August 2006, industry regulator Ofcom issued Time 107.3 with a &#x27;yellow card&#x27;, officially recognising that the station was not operating within its format obligations. Following a listener complaint, Ofcom found the station in breach of its music policy - playing a significantly higher percentage of &#x27;current chart hits&#x27; than its 33% limit - as well as the accuracy of its &#x27;public file&#x27;, which carried misleading information as to the amount of automated programming broadcast per day.

Ofcom&#x27;s report carried the admission from the station&#x27;s management that outside breakfast, output was automated - indeed, during the latter days of Time&#x27;s operation, only four hours of daily output were live, and Time&#x27;s &#x27;public file&#x27; was amended accordingly.

Thanks to specialist shows at weekends, the &#x27;yellow card&#x27; was lifted at the end of August 2007, after Ofcom concluded that, after further sampling, the station was now operating within its format.

==South London Radio relaunch==

At 11am on 20 May 2007, Time 107.3 was relaunched as South London Radio with Tom Hogan playing the first song, George Benson&#x27;s &#x27;Never Give Up On A Good Thing&#x27;, and, with the exception of the then-breakfast presenter Jonathan Miles, an entirely new presentation line-up was introduced, with seventeen hours of live output a day.

The station&#x27;s coverage area was also altered - no longer serving Southwark, and instead, thanks to approved transmitter adjustments, moving westwards to focus on the boroughs of Lewisham, Bromley, Croydon and their conurbations.

==Performance and subsequent closure==

Much like sister station Time 106.8, South London Radio struggled badly to deliver large audiences in a cut-throat London radio market. Despite an adjustment in the survey area to incorporate the boroughs of Bromley and Croydon in late 2007, RAJAR figures were largely unaffected: in its final listening survey at the end of 2008, the station reached 19,000 listeners a week, representing a 0.4% audience share.

In an unusual move, the Sunrise Radio Group put the station up for sale via a message on its website in mid-October 2008, and following disputed claims that a buyer had been found, South London Radio ceased broadcasting at midnight on Saturday 4 April 2009.

<text>Time 107.5 is an Independent Local Radio station, based in Romford and broadcasting to East London and parts of Essex.
The station strapline is &quot;All Time Favourites&quot; and the station is available in FM on 107.5 MHz in the broadcast area and online via its website, Smart Speakers and via smart phone apps.

In 2024, it celebrated its 20th anniversary under the brand of Time FM.

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 14,000, according to RAJAR.

==History==
The station launched as Active 107.5 FM and, after ten years of planning, went on air on 18 May 1998, broadcasting to east London and in particular to the London Boroughs of Havering and Barking &amp; Dagenham. Active FM played a mix of new and old pop music with an emphasis on soul and rhythm and blues; evening shows catered for specialist musical tastes covering genres including disco, garage and contemporary club music. The station had its own local news team which would broadcast from Studio 2.

The station was run out of Lambourne House, Romford and its transmitter was located on the roof.

Active FM was bought by UKRD Group which later ran the station as Soul City FM.

Time FM is the third name used by the station and was re branded along with a format change from Soul City when it then became known as Time 107.5 FM in April 2004. It was adopted when the company was acquired by the London Media Company, a subdivision of the Sunrise Radio Group.
Time In January 2014, Time 107.5 LTD entered administration, along with its sister stations, Time 106.6, Sunrise Radio and Kismat Radio. On 4 February 2014 they were acquired for an estimated £2m by Lyca Media II Ltd, a subdivision of Lycamobile. The station has retained its branding as &#x27;Time 107.5FM&#x27;.

==Programming==
Time 107.5 plays a variety of music from the 1960s to the present day. News reports are live, in-house bulletins, with local stories covering the London Boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Havering and Redbridge.

<text>Leo W. Buss (born 1953) is a retired Professor at Yale University&#x27;s departments of geology, geophysics, and ecology and evolutionary biology.

==Life==
He graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D in 1979.

His evolutionary developmental biology book approaches the subject of the evolution of metazoan development from a cell lineage selection point of view.
He reevaluates August Weismann&#x27;s model of the cell compartmentalization of somatic and germline cell lineages (see Weismann barrier), and argues that the vision of the individual taken by the modern synthesis is insufficient to explain the early evolution of development or ontogeny.

He collaborated with Walter Fontana in producing some of the first papers on artificial chemistries.

<doc id="977359" wikidata="Q676372" url="?curid=977359" title="UNI Global Union">
<text>UNI Global Union, formally Union Network International (UNI), is a Global Union Federation for the skills and services sectors, uniting national and regional trade unions. It has affiliated unions in 150 countries representing 20 million workers. The Global headquarters is in Nyon, Switzerland. UNI Global Union ratified over 50 Global Framework Agreements with multinational corporations including ABN AMRO, Carrefour, H&amp;M, DHL, Telefonica, BNP Orange and Banco de Brazil, Inditex Group, Kimberly Clark among others as of 2021.

==History==
UNI was the result of the merger of four organisations: International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET), Media and Entertainment International (MEI), International Graphical Federation (IGF), and Communications International (CI). They merged on 1 January 2000, to form Union Network International. On 2 March 2009, the federation changed its name to UNI Global Union.

==International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET)==
The first attempt to create an international federation of clerical workers was the International Commercial Employees&#x27; Secretariat, founded in Hamburg in 1909 and led by Edo Fimmen. This organization collapsed at the start of World War I, leading to the establishment of FIET in 1921 in Vienna. Initially, FIET represented only European unions, but after World War II, it began admitting unions from around the world. By 1994, FIET&#x27;s membership had reached 11 million. FIET predominantly represented workers in banking, insurance, and clerical staff in commerce and social services. In 1984, the International Secretariat of Entertainment Trade Unions became an autonomous section of FIET.

==Media and Entertainment International (MEI)==
MEI was a global union federation representing workers in the arts, established in 1993 through the merger of the International Secretariat of Arts, Communications, Media and Entertainment Trade Unions and the International Federation of Trade Unions of Audio-Visual Workers. Initially named the International Secretariat for Arts, Mass Media, and Entertainment Trade Unions (ISAMMETU), it was renamed MEI in 1995. MEI campaigned for public service broadcasting and minimum working conditions for freelance film and theatre workers. On 1 January 2000, MEI merged with FIET, IGF, and CI to form Union Network International.

==International Graphical Federation (IGF)==
The IGF was a global union federation for printing workers. Efforts to establish this federation began in 1939, but it was officially founded in 1949 in Stockholm after World War II delayed its formation. The IGF focused on technical developments in the industry and sharing information on industrial disputes and employment standards. The federation operated on a non-political basis and had three boards covering typography, lithography, and bookbinding. By the end of 1999, the IGF merged with FIET, CI, and MEI to form Union Network International.

==Communications International (CI)==
The Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (PTTI) was the precursor to Communications International (CI). Founded in 1920 in Milan, it initially consisted of European unions but expanded globally after World War II. By 1994, it had four million members from various continents. Recognizing the importance of new forms of communication, the federation renamed itself as Communications International in 1997. At the end of 1999, CI merged with FIET, IGF, and MEI to form Union Network International.

==Global Agreements==
=== Societe Generale Agreement ===
In 2023, UNI Global Union renewed its global agreement with Societe Generale. This new three-year agreement, building on previous accords from 2015 and 2019, includes enhanced commitments to combat discrimination, foster a safe working environment, and uphold workers&#x27; rights to freedom of association. The agreement covers 147,000 employees across 67 countries, emphasizing the bank&#x27;s dedication to human rights and social dialogue.

=== Carrefour Agreement ===
In October 2022, UNI Global Union reinforced its global framework agreement with Carrefour. This agreement, which extends until October 2025, focuses on promoting social dialogue, protecting workers from discrimination, and implementing ILO Convention 190 on eliminating violence and harassment in the workplace. The renewed agreement has been pivotal in securing better working conditions and union recognition in countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Korea, Romania, and Turkey.

=== Global Agreement with Teleperformance ===
In December 2023, UNI Global Union celebrated the first anniversary of its global agreement with Teleperformance. This landmark agreement covers nearly 500,000 employees in 95 countries and focuses on improving workers&#x27; rights and health and safety conditions. Implementation has begun in countries such as Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Poland, and Romania.

==Campaigns and Labor Actions==
=== Amazon Labor Unrest ===
In January 2024, UNI Global Union coordinated strikes and protests across Amazon facilities globally, highlighting significant labor unrest. This included a major strike at Amazon&#x27;s Birmingham warehouse, marking the anniversary of the UK&#x27;s first Amazon protest. The strikes reflect widespread discontent with Amazon&#x27;s labor practices, particularly concerning intrusive performance monitoring and adverse working conditions.

=== Campaign for Essential Workers ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, UNI Global Union launched a campaign to support essential workers. This included securing agreements to improve working conditions and advocating for better health and safety measures across various sectors.

==== Support for RWJ Hospital Nurses ====
During the UNI Global Union Congress in Philadelphia in August 2023, a delegation of 38 workers from 16 countries joined the picket line of Local 4-200 nurses at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. This international solidarity was part of a broader effort to advocate for safe staffing levels and better working conditions for healthcare workers.

=== International Campaigns for Worker Safety ===
In 2024, UNI Global Union and IndustriALL Global Union called on Amazon to sign the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry. This campaign aims to ensure that Amazon commits to the same safety standards that other brands have implemented following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh.

=== Campaign for Respect at Work in Ireland ===
Around International Workers&#x27; Day in 2024, UNI Global Union supported the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) in launching Ireland&#x27;s first-ever Trade Union Week. This campaign aimed to mobilize trade union members and improve workers&#x27; rights across Ireland, addressing issues such as low pay and weak worker protection laws.

=== Remote Work Rights ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNI Global Union released a set of principles to support collective bargaining for remote workers’ rights in February 2021. These principles focus on ensuring labor protections, restricting surveillance, guaranteeing the right to disconnect, and addressing work-life balance issues.

=== Right to Disconnect Campaign ===
UNI Global Union has launched a global campaign to help workers reclaim their right to disconnect from their jobs. This campaign, supported by detailed guidelines for negotiating disconnection terms, aims to combat the anxiety, depression, and burnout associated with constant connectivity. Agreements have already been secured with major companies like Telefonica and Orange.

=== Peace Initiatives ===
UNI Global Union continues its commitment to building peace, as demonstrated in its engagement with the peace movement in Nagasaki. This initiative highlights the union&#x27;s dedication to social justice and its belief that there can be no peace without justice. The campaign includes working with organizations like ICAN and IPB to promote nuclear disarmament and peaceful resolutions to conflicts.

==== IKEA Group Dispute ====
In July 2023, the Dutch National Contact Point published the final statement on the dispute between UNI Global Union and IKEA Group. The dispute centered on workers&#x27; freedom of association in IKEA’s operations in Ireland, Portugal, and the USA. The process facilitated by the NCP led to agreements in Portugal but not in the USA or Ireland. The final statement included recommendations for improving labor relations and ensuring the right to organize.

<doc id="977361" wikidata="Q422173" url="?curid=977361" title="Jadeite">
<text>Jadeite is a pyroxene mineral with composition NaAlSi2O6. It is hard (Mohs hardness of about 6.5 to 7.0), very tough, and dense, with a specific gravity of about 3.4. It is found in a wide range of colors, but is most often found in shades of green or white. Jadeite is formed only in the subduction zones of continental margins, where rock undergoes metamorphism at high pressure but relatively low temperature.

Jadeite is the principal mineral making up the most valuable form of jade, a precious stone particularly prized in China. Most gem-quality jadeite jade comes from northern Myanmar. Jade tools and implements have been found at Stone Age sites, showing that the mineral has been prized by humans since before the beginning of written history.

==Name==
The name &quot;jadeite&quot; is derived (via and ) from the Spanish phrase &quot;piedra de ijada&quot; which means &quot;stone of the side&quot;. The Latin version of the name, &quot;lapis nephriticus&quot;, is the origin of the term nephrite, which is a different mineral that also shares the common name jade.

==Properties==
Jadeite is a hard, extremely tough, rare mineral of the clinopyroxene family of minerals.
Though highly variable in color, it is typically apple-green to emerald-green, or less commonly white or white with spots of green. Occurrences are typically granular or massive; individual crystals are very rare, occurring only as small prismatic crystals in vugs in massive jadeite. Crystals are four-sided or eight-sided in cross section and show perfect cleavage on [110] at angles of 87 and 93 degrees. There is also a rare parting on [100]. The interlocking crystals of massive jadeite help give it its extreme toughness.

Jadeite has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 to 7, slightly less than that of common quartz. Fracture surfaces are sugary in texture, and sparkle from the exposed perfect cleavage on [110]. Jade is relatively dense, with a specific gravity of 3.3 to 3.5 in natural specimens. The specific gravity increases with the iron content, and very pure jadeite has a specific gravity of 3.25. The luster is vitreous, or pearly on exposed cleavage surfaces, and the streak is colorless. Jadeite is translucent to transparent.

Jadeite is characterized by its green color and tough aggregates of compact fibrous crystals. It can be distinguished from nephrite by its vitreous luster on polished surfaces (polished nephrite has an oily luster) and by its higher density and refractive index. Serpentine also has a lower density and refractive index than jadeite. Massive jadeite also characteristically shows a more granular texture than nephrite or serpentinite.

Jadeite has a fusibility of 2.5 (making it moderately easy to fuse with a propane flame) and gives a yellow flame color.

Pure jadeite has the composition and has the typical clinopyroxene structure. This consists of long chains of silica tetrahedra in which each silicon ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions, with two of the oxygen ions shared with neighboring silica tetraheda. The chains are bonded together by aluminium and sodium ions to form the full three-dimensional structure of a jadeite crystal. The aluminium joins pairs of chains (occupying the so-called M1 site) while sodium joins the paired chains to neighboring paired chains (occupying the so-called M2 site). The resulting crystal structure belongs to the monoclinic system, with space group &quot;C2/c&quot;.

==Chemistry and origin==
Pure jadeite has the composition . There is no significant replacement of silicon by aluminium in natural jadeite, and only very limited substitution of ferric iron for aluminium. However, calcium substitutes for up to 20% of the sodium, balanced by substitution of magnesium or ferrous iron for aluminium.

Omphacite is intermediate in composition between jadeite and diopside. However, there is not a true solid solution series, as omphacite has its own structure that is slightly different from either pure jadeite or pure diopside, so that it is separated from either end member by a miscibility gap. &quot;Chloromelanite&quot; is a dark green variety of jadeite in which some aluminium is replaced by iron, while &quot;imperial jade&quot;, the most valuable variety of jade, is colored an intense emerald green by traces of chromium.
Jadeite occurs with albite in metamorphic rock of the low-temperature, high-pressure blueschist facies at destructive plate margins. Although it is intermediate in silica content between albite and nepheline, it is not stable under the conditions in which these two minerals are present. Formation of jadeite requires a pressure of 10 to 25 kbar and a temperature of via the reaction:

Jadeite can also form at high pressure via the reaction:

At still higher pressure, corresponding to the highest blueschist facies, jadeite reacts with lawsonite to form zoisite and paragonite:

Minerals associated with jadeite include: glaucophane, lawsonite, muscovite, aragonite, serpentine and quartz.

Rocks that consist almost entirely of jadeite are called jadeitite. In all well-documented occurrences, jadeitite appears to have formed from subduction zone fluids in association with serpentinite.

Jadeitite is resistant to weathering, and alluvial boulders of jadeitite released from the serpentine-rich environments in which they formed can have weights of up to tons. Raw specimens having Burmese tax stamps or polished slots for evaluating quality are prized by some collectors.

==Colors==

Jadeite&#x27;s color commonly ranges from white through pale apple green to deep &quot;jade&quot; green but can also be blue-green (like the recently rediscovered &quot;Olmec Blue&quot; jade), pink, lavender and a multitude of other rare colors. &quot;Chloromelanite&quot; is a very dark green to black variety. Color is largely affected by the presence of trace elements such as chromium and iron. Its translucence varies from opaque to almost clear. Variations in color and translucence are often found even within a single specimen.

==Occurrence==
Significant occurrences of jadeite are isolated and rare. It is found exclusively in high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic rock of continental margins. Here it may be found as pods or veins or as disseminated grains. Deposits are found in Myanmar, the Alps, Russia, California, Japan, and Guatemala. In the Franciscan Complex of California, jadeite is associated with glaucophane, aragonite, muscovite, lawsonite, and quartz. However, occurrences of lapidary quality are almost exclusive to Myanmar. Stream boulders of the Uyu River remain an important source of jadeite.

==Uses==
Jadeite is the dominant mineral of the most desirable variety of jade. This was prized in traditional Chinese culture, where it was worked into a great variety of beautiful ornaments and utensils.

Jadeite was also used by Stone Age peoples for implements and weapons.

Jade received its name, &quot;piedra de ijada&quot; (&quot;stone of the side&quot;), because it was once thought to cure kidney ailments when applied to the side of the body.

===Jade===
Jadeite is one of two minerals recognized as the gemstone jade. The other is nephrite. Occasionally, other minerals such as serpentine or quartz are sold as jade, but the difference can be determined by cleavage and hardness. Jadeite jade is the most valuable form, with the highest-quality material commanding prices well in excess of $200 per carat . Jadeite jade first came into significant use in China only towards the end of the 18th century, as &quot;fei tsui&quot;.

Jadeite from the Motagua Valley, Guatemala, was used by the Olmec and Maya peoples, as well as the indigenous peoples of Costa Rica.

Unusual colors, like &quot;Olmec blue&quot; jade, which is characterized by its deep blue-green, translucent hue with white flecking, are becoming more highly valued because of its unique beauty and historical use by the Mesoamerican Olmec and also in Costa Rica.

===Stone Age use===
Over 180 axe heads made from jadeitite quarried in northern Italy in the Neolithic era have been found across the British Isles. Because of the difficulty of working this material, all the axe heads of this type found are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange.

A great many jadeite beads and axe heads as well as the remains of jadeite workshops from the Neolithic era have been uncovered in Itoigawa, Japan. These beads and axes were traded throughout Japan and the Korean Peninsula and were produced by the world&#x27;s oldest known jadeite-using culture, centered on the Itoigawa region.

<doc id="977364" wikidata="Q1384850" url="?curid=977364" title="National Lift Tower">
<text>The National Lift Tower (previously called the Express Lift Tower) is a lift-testing tower built by the Express Lift Company (a lifts division of the General Electric Company) off Weedon Road in Northampton, England. The structure was commissioned in 1978 with construction commencing in 1980 and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 November 1982. It has been a Grade II Listed Building since 1997.

The tower can be viewed from Arbury Hill, the highest point in Northamptonshire.

== Background ==
===The site===
The tower is in St James End, west of Northampton town centre. The area is named after Northampton Abbey, an Augustinian monastery dedicated to St James, which was founded in 1104–1105. When the former Express Lift factory, which included the lift-testing tower, was redeveloped for housing in 1999–2000, excavations were carried out to determine the location and remains of any parts of the abbey. A cemetery of burials was excavated during winter 2000–2001. The bones were analyzed to determine the health and burial practices in the late-medieval population of Northampton.

===Construction===
Designed by architect Maurice Walton of Stimpson Walton Bond, the tower is tall, in diameter at the base and tapers to at the top. The only lift-testing tower in Britain, and one of only two in Europe, it was granted Grade II listed building status on 30 October 1997, making it the youngest listed building in the UK at the time. The building&#x27;s small, obround shaped windows were a design motif of the Express Lift Company, whose lift control panels featured control buttons and floor indicators of the same shape.

In January 1997, the tower fell out of use after Express was taken over by Otis (who typically used its test facilities in the United States). In 1999, the tower and surrounding land was sold to Wilcon Homes for development.
From the time it was built, one shaft was specifically used by the British Standards Institution (BSI) for type testing of lift safety components at the time under the BS 5655 and BS EN81 standards. Safety Gear testing involved putting the lift cars (frame) into free fall conditions with rated mass at tripping speeds as required by the designers of the safety gear to ensure the lift cars decelerated and stopped within the requirements of the standard. Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at tripping speeds to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the safety components stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant. BSI ceased using the test tower soon after the site was acquired for housing in 1997–1998.
The building is now privately owned and has been renamed the National Lift Tower. Following extensive renovation and repairs, the tower was re-opened for business in October 2009. The tower is used by lift companies for research, development, testing and marketing. As well as being a resource for the lift industry, the building is also available to companies requiring tall vertical spaces, for example companies wishing to test working-at-height safety devices.

There are six lift shafts of varying heights and speeds, including a high-speed shaft with a travel of and a theoretical maximum speed of .

The tower&#x27;s renovation was officially completed in July 2010. Further building work was planned with planning permission being sought to build a visitor&#x27;s centre incorporating a 100-seater auditorium and cafe. However, permission for this structure was denied by Northampton Borough Council in March 2012.

Abseiling at the tower has been going on since May 2011 with over £140,000 having been raised for charity in the period to May 2012. Northampton Borough Council has now granted approval for it to be used up to 24 times a year for abseiling.

As of 2015, the tower was being used as the world&#x27;s tallest drainage-testing facility.

===Local radio broadcasting===
The tower once housed a transmitter on the top of it, for broadcasting community radio station Revolution Radio on FM 96.1 MHz, which launched on 12 June 2021.

== Mentions ==

* The tower featured prominently in a 1993 episode of the Channel 4 educational programme &quot;The Secret Life of Machines&quot; (Series 3, Episode 1), in which Tim Hunkin demonstrates the operation of the high-speed lift in the tower.
* The tower was lampooned by broadcaster Terry Wogan as the &quot;Northampton lighthouse&quot;. He wrote a section of the book &quot;Icons of Northamptonshire&quot; (2014) about it.
* The &quot;Northampton Chronicle &amp; Echo&quot; published an article for April Fools&#x27; Day 2008, claiming that the lift tower would be pulled down. Comments were made on the paper&#x27;s website regarding the lack of respect of the local council for not publicly announcing it. Another April Fools&#x27; Day story in the same paper suggested the tower would be redeveloped as a mooring station for airships.
* The Lift Tower is featured in the science fiction novel &quot;Time to Repair&quot; by Mark Gallard.

<text>Pinus heldreichii (synonym &quot;P. leucodermis&quot;; family Pinaceae), the Bosnian pine or Heldreich&#x27;s pine, is a species of pine native to mountainous areas of the Balkans and southern Italy.

==Description==
It is an evergreen tree up to in height, and in trunk diameter.

It is a member of the hard pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;, with leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) in fascicles (bundles) of two, with a persistent sheath. They are long and thick. Cones are long, with thin, fragile scales; they are dark blue-purple before maturation, turning brown when ripe about 16–18 months after pollination. The long seeds have a wing and are wind-dispersed.
=== Longevity ===
A tree in Northern Greece was dated as 1,075 years old in 2016.

What is believed to be the oldest known living tree in Europe has been discovered in a remote mountainous area of the Pollino National Park in southern Italy. It is a Heldreich&#x27;s pine estimated at 1,230 years. Much of its core has turned to dust, but there is enough new growth to confirm it is still alive.

A notable specimen in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria, known as Baikushev&#x27;s pine, is tall, in diameter, and is estimated to be over 1300 years old.

== Nomenclature ==
The species was first described as &quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot; by the Swiss botanist K. Hermann Christ in honour of Theodor von Heldreich in 1863 from specimens collected on Mount Olympus, and then described a second time as &quot;P. leucodermis&quot; in 1864; the author of the second description (the Austrian botanist F. Antoine who found it on Orjen above the Bay of Kotor in Montenegro) being unaware of the slightly earlier publication by Christ. Some minor morphological differences have been claimed between the two descriptions (leading to the maintenance of both as separate taxa by a few botanists), but this is not supported by modern studies of the species, which show that both names refer to the same taxon. The discrepancies in the descriptions are largely due to Christ&#x27;s cone specimens being immature and shrunken after drying, having been collected in July, four months before maturity.

== Distribution ==
It can be found in the mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, southwestern Bulgaria, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo, northern Greece (Valia Kalda, Smolikas and Vasilitsa, Mount Olympus and in other high mountains), and locally in southern Italy (it is the symbol of the Pollino National Park), growing at altitude. It reaches the alpine tree line in these areas.

==Cultivation and uses==
Bosnian pine is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, giving reliable, steady, though not fast, growth on a wide range of sites, and with a very neat, conical crown. It is also noted for its very decorative purple cones. The cultivars ‘Smidtii’ and ‘Compact Gem’ have been given the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It is hardy down to at least , and tolerant of severe wind exposure. Many in cultivation are still grown under the name &quot;Pinus leucodermis&quot; or &quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot; var. &quot;leucodermis&quot;.

&quot;P. heldreichii&quot; is able to adapt to extreme environmental conditions and is also a great colonizer. It is resistant to sulphur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, nitrogen dioxide and ozone pollution and is further able to withstand wind, ice and heavy snow. These abilities makes it suitable for reforestation of extensive dry and high-altitude areas. In the south of Italy it is planted because it is less susceptible to pests than other pine species. 

The wood of the tree species is very aromatic, containing several types of monoterpenes and diterpenes, noticeably limonene, and thus is commonly utilised in the Balkans for making wine barrels for white wines.

<text>Sust or Sost () is a village located in the Gojal, Upper Hunza in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan. Situated at an elevation of 2,800 meters above sea level, Sost is the last Pakistani town on the Karakoram Highway before the Chinese border. 

The town plays an important role in the transportation of both passengers and cargo because it serves as the gateway for all traffic crossing the Pakistan-China border. The Pakistani immigration and customs departments are based in Sost, making it a pivotal point for border clearance and administrative procedures. Furthermore, Pakistan and China have opened the border at Khunjerab for trade and tourism.

The Silk Route Dry Port commenced its business operations at the port in Sost, Upper Hunza, near the Khunjerab Pass in Gilgit-Baltistan. The annual trade volume between these two countries has seen a significant increase, rising from less than $2 billion in 2002 to $6.9 billion, with an ambitious target of reaching $15 billion by 2014.

Sost Dry Por is the first formal port at the China-Pakistan border. It serves as a critical hub for customs clearance and other necessary formalities for goods moving from the city of Kashgar and the surrounding Xinjiang autonomous region in China to various commercial centers in Pakistan. 

The town of Sost is well-connected by the Karakoram Highway, which links it to several towns and cities in both Pakistan and China. To the south, it connects to Gulmit, Aliabad, Gilgit and Chilas while in the north, it provides access to the Chinese cities of Tashkurgan, Upal and Kashgar, thereby enhancing trade and transportation routes in the region.

The Main languages spoken here are Wakhi and Brushki.

==Karakoram Highway==
The Sost dry port is connected by the Karakoram Highway to Gulmit, Aliabad, Gilgit and Chilas on the south and to the Chinese cities of Tashkurgan, Upal and Kashgar in the north. The Northern Areas Transport Corporation offers passenger road service between Islamabad, Gilgit and Sost. Passenger road service between Tashkurgan and Sost also exists. Road service between Kashgar and Gilgit (via Tashkurgan and Sost) started in summer 2006. However, the border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass (the highest border of the world) is open only between April 1 and November 30. Under the protocol agreement signed by Pakistan and Chinese authorities, the border is usually closed on Nov 30 and reopened on April 1 every year.

<text>A military uniform is a standardised dress worn by members of the armed forces and paramilitaries of various nations.

Military dress and styles have gone through significant changes over the centuries, from colourful and elaborate, ornamented clothing until the 19th century, to utilitarian camouflage uniforms for field and battle purposes from World War I (1914–1918) on. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority.

Military uniforms differ not only according to military units but tend to also be offered in different levels of formality in accordance with Western dress codes: full dress uniform for formal wear, mess dress uniform for formal evening wear, service dress uniform for informal wear, and combat uniform (also called &quot;battle/field dress&quot;) which would equal casual wear. Sometimes added to the casual wear category is physical training uniforms. The study used to design and produce military uniforms is referred to as military textile science.

==History==
A distinction should be made between uniforms and ethnic dress. If a particular people or culture favoured a distinctive dress style this could easily create the impression of uniformly dressed warriors. The issue is further complicated by the distinctive features (weapons, armour, fighting style and native dress) of particularly effective warrior classes often being copied. Thus the distinctive and colourful clothing of the Hungarian hussars became a model for hussar units all over Europe. The kilts and sporrans of Scottish Highland clans were distilled into regimental dress when the British Army started to recruit from these tribal groups.

Mercenary or irregular fighters could also develop their own fashions, which set them apart from civilians, but were not really uniforms. The clothing of the German Landsknechte of the 16th century is an example of distinctive military fashion. Special units such as Zouaves developed non-standard uniforms to distinguish them from troops of the line.

===Antiquity===
There are a few recorded attempts at uniform dress in antiquity, going beyond the similarity to be expected of ethnic or tribal dress. One example is the Spanish infantry of Hannibal who wore white tunics with crimson edgings. Another is the Spartan hoplite in his red garment, attributed by Plutarch &quot;partly because it seems to be a manly colour and partly because (it) causes more terror amongst inexperienced foes&quot;. The Terracotta Army discovered in the tomb of the first Emperor of China (c. 200 BC) have a superficial similarity but closer examination shows up to seven different styles of armour, which do not appear to have been standardised within separate units.

====Rome====

The legions of the Roman Republic and Empire had a fairly standardised dress and armour, particularly from approximately the early to mid 1st century onward, when Lorica Segmentata (segmented armour) was introduced. However the lack of unified production for the Roman army meant that there were still considerable differences in detail. Even the armour produced in state factories varied according to the province of origin. Fragments of surviving clothing and wall paintings indicate that the basic tunic of the Roman soldier was of un-dyed (off-white) or red-dyed wool. Senior commanders are known to have worn white cloaks and plumes. Centurions – the century commanders who made up the long serving backbone of the legions – were distinguished by transverse crests on their helmets, various chest ornaments (phaleræ) corresponding to modern medals, torques (a symbol borrowed from the Gauls and also used as a military award), and the vine stick (Vitis) that they carried as a mark of their office.

While some auxiliary cohorts in the late Roman period had carried shields with distinctive colours or designs, there is no evidence that any one Roman legion was distinguished from another by features other than the numbers on the leather covers protecting their shields.

===Post-classical era===
The feudal system of Western Europe provided instances of distinguishing features denoting allegiance to one or another lord. These however seldom went beyond colours and patterns painted on shields or embroidered on surcoats. Orders of military monks such as the Knights Templar or Hospitaller wore mantles respectively of white (with red crosses on the shoulder) and of black (later red with white crosses) over the usual pattern of armour for their periods. In the later part of the Medieval period instances of standardised clothing being issued for particular campaigns began to occur. English examples included the white coats worn by Norfolk levies recruited in 1296 and the green and white clothing that identified Cheshire archers during the 14th century.

The regular thematic (provincial) and Tagmata (central) troops of the Byzantine Empire (East Roman) are the first known soldiers to have had what would now be considered regimental or unit identification. During the 10th century, each of the cavalry &quot;banda&quot; making up these forces is recorded as having plumes and other distinctions in a distinctive colour. Officers wore a waist sash or &quot;pekotarion&quot;, which may have been of different colours according to rank.

===Early modern era===
====European regimental dress====

The styles and decoration of military uniforms varied immensely with the status, image, and resources of the military throughout the ages. Uniform dress became the norm with the adoption of regimental systems, initially by the French army in the mid-17th century. Before 1600 a few German and Dutch regiments had worn red or yellow coats. From about 1626 onwards some Swedish infantry had been issued with standard coloured dress under Gustavus Adolphus (hence his &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; regiments). However, most levies of the 15th and 16th centuries wore civilian dress and regiments were dressed at the expense of their colonels in whatever style and colours the colonel preferred. Even Royal guards would sometimes only be issued with distinctive coloured or embroidered surcoats to wear over ordinary clothing. To help armies distinguish friend from foe, scarves, pieces of foliage, or other makeshift identification known as &quot;field signs&quot; would be worn, (a practice still recognised under international humanitarian law and the laws of war as a &quot;distinctive sign&quot;). Field signs were easily removed or donned, as in the example of John Smith, a squire on the Royalist side who at the Battle of Edgehill put on the orange scarf of the Parliamentarians and with no more elaborate disguise recaptured the royal standard from the Earl of Essex&#x27;s own secretary.

By this time, in France at least, the general character of the clothes and accoutrements to be worn on various occasions was strictly regulated by orders. But uniformity of clothing was not to be expected so long as the &quot;enlistment&quot; system prevailed and soldiers were taken in and dismissed at the beginning and end of every campaign. The beginnings of uniform are therefore to be found in truly national armies, in the Indelta of Gustavus Adolphus, and the English armies of the English Civil War. In the earlier years of the latter, though the richer colonels uniformed their men (for instance, the Marquess of Newcastle&#x27;s &quot;Whitecoats&quot; and King Charles&#x27;s own red-coated Lifeguard of foot), the rustics and the citizens turned out for war in their ordinary rough clothes, donning armour and sword-belt. But in 1645 the Long Parliament raised an army for permanent service, and the colonels became officials rather than proprietors. The New Model Army was clothed in the civilian costume of the date—ample coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings and shoes (in the case of cavalry, boots)—but with the distinctive colour throughout the army of red and with regimental facings of various colours and breeches of grey. Soon afterwards the helmet was replaced by a grey broad-brimmed hat. From the coat was eventually evolved the tunic of the mid-19th century, and the hat became the cocked hat of a later generation, which generally disappeared during the decade of 1800–1810 to reappear in the late 19th and early 20th century, by which time it had its original form of a &quot;slouch-hat.&quot; For service in Ireland the New Model Army&#x27;s red coat was exchanged for one of russet colour, just as scarlet gave way to khaki for Indian service in the 19th century. The Ironsides cavalry, however, wore buff leather coats and armour long after the infantry had abandoned them.

Thus the principle ever since followed — uniform coat and variegated facings — was established. By choice or convenience the majority of the corps out of which the New Model Army was formed had come to be dressed in red, with facings according to the colonel&#x27;s taste. In Austria sixty years afterwards events took the same course. The colonels there uniformed their men as they saw fit, but had, probably to obtain &quot;wholesale&quot; prices, agreed upon a serviceable colour, pearl grey. When in 1707 Prince Eugene procured the issue of uniform regulations, few line regiments had to be re-clothed. In France, as in England and Austria, the cavalry, still led by the wealthy classes rather than officered by the professional, was not uniformed upon an army system until after the infantry. But in 1688 six-sevenths of the French cavalry was uniformed in light grey with red facings; and about half the dragoon regiments had red uniforms and blue facings. The Marquis of Louvois, in creating a standing army, had introduced an infantry uniform as a necessary consequence. The native French regiments had light grey coats, the Swiss red, the German black and the Italian blue, with various facings. The French grey was probably decided upon, like the Austrian grey, as being a good &quot;service&quot; colour, which could be cheaply manufactured.
During the 18th century the normal military uniform in Europe comprised a standardised form of civilian dress (tricorn hat, long-skirted coat, waistcoat and breeches). One distinctively military feature were the long canvas gaiters which came up to mid-thigh and had multiple buttons. Dress was surprisingly standardised between European armies in cut and general outline. The distinction normally lay in colours: red coats for the British and Danes, light grey then white for the French, Spanish, and Austrian infantry, dark blue for the Prussians and Portuguese, green for the Russians, etc. Within each army different regiments were usually distinguished by &quot;facings&quot; — linings, turnbacks, and braiding on coats in colours that were distinctive to one or several regiments. The Royal Comtois Infantry Regiment of the French Army, for example, had large dark blue cuffs on its off-white coats. To a certain extent the functions required of a given group of soldiers were reflected in their dress. Thus artillery uniforms in most armies were usually of dark blue, for the practical reason that handling black powder would have soiled lighter coloured clothing. Infantry drummers and cavalry trumpeters often had &quot;reverse&quot; colours with coats the colour of the regimental facings and facings the colour of the regimental coats.

Officers (who paid for their own clothing) were slower to accept uniforms. During the late 17th century they were often dressed in individual styles and colours according to their own taste and means. In part this was because the uniform dress issued to the rank and file was considered a form of livery — the mark of a servant and demeaning to members of the social class from which officers came. One early practice in the French and other armies was for officers to wear coats of the facing colour of their regiments. Rank insignia as such was unknown until well into the 18th century. The gorget hanging from a chain around the neck (a last survival of medieval armour) was the only universally recognised mark of an officer until epaulettes developed from clusters of ribbons formerly worn on the shoulder. In the British army officers were ordered to adopt epaulettes by a clothing warrant dated 1768. Even when officers&#x27; uniforms became the subject of detailed regulation they remained easily distinguishable from those of other ranks, by the better quality and richness of the materials and trimmings used. Gold or silver braiding on the hats and coats of officers usually matched the bronze or pewter of the numerous buttons on regimental clothing.
New uniforms were issued with surprising frequency in some 18th-century armies (once a year in the British service). It should, however, be remembered that a soldier had to march, parade, fight and sometimes sleep in the same garment and that such extras as greatcoats or working clothes were seldom issued until the end of the century.

====Ottoman Empire====

The highly organised armies of the Ottoman Empire employed distinctive features of dress to distinguish one corps or class of soldier from another. An example would be the conical black hats of felt worn by the Deli cavalry of the early 19th century. However the basic costume was usually that of the tribal group or social class from which a particular class of warrior was drawn. As such it was sufficiently varied not to rank as &quot;uniform&quot; in the later sense. An elaborate system of colourful standards largely provided unit identification. Even the appearance of the Janissaries was likely to reflect individual means and taste, although red was a favoured colour and the white felt zarcola headdresses were similar.
It was not until the reorganisation of the Ottoman Army by Sultan Mahmud II during the 1820s that completely standardised dress was issued.

===Later modern era===

The first fifteen years of the 19th century influenced the appearance of military uniforms until the 1850s. In particular, some uniforms of the Grande Armée – notably those of the cavalry regiments of the Imperial Guard – are considered as being amongst the most striking and distinctive of the time. The cost of the French uniforms varied widely, going from 200 to 250 francs for a line infantryman&#x27;s outfit to 2000 francs for a cuirassier&#x27;s uniform. Cavalrymen of the Guard had no fewer than 10 different uniforms. One justification for the expensive parade dresses of the Guard was that they would &quot;lead the people of the conquered nations to regard the French uniforms with unreserved astonishment&quot;. As a general trend France and other European states replaced their bicornes by feathered shakos or crested helmets, while the coatee-type jacket replaced the combination of tailcoat and waistcoat.
The ornamental peak of the military uniform was reached in the early 19th century in Western Europe. Sometimes the Napoleonic Wars are identified as being the acme of colourful and ornate uniforms, but actually the several decades of relative peace that followed were a time of even more decorative styles and embellishments. The Napoleonic soldier on campaign was likely to present a shabby and nondescript appearance as unsuitable peacetime dress quickly deteriorated or was replaced with whatever local substitutes were available.

Until later on in the century dyes were primitive and different batches of uniforms worn by the same unit might present differing shades, especially after exposure to rain and sun. The white uniforms popular amongst many armies through the 18th and early 19th centuries soiled easily and had to be pipeclayed to retain any semblance of cleanliness. Green as worn by Jäger and Rifle regiments proved particularly prone to fading until suitable chemical dyes were devised in the 1890s. British soldiers were known for their striking red clothing (hence the name &quot;Redcoats&quot;). This was actually a fairly dull shade of madder red until the general adoption of scarlet for tunics in the 1870s.

====Navies====
In an early instance of military camouflage, the sailors of Imperial Rome are reported to have worn blue/grey tunics.
However uniform dress was not a feature of navies (officers and marines excepted) until comparatively recent times. This may reflect the considerable difference in roles and conditions of service between sailors and soldiers.

No uniform was prescribed for the French Navy until a standardised suit for officers of blue and red was decreed in 1764. This evolved from optional blue clothing authorised by Royal decree as early as 1665, although practical grey, brown or black colours were worn at sea. In other 17th-18th navies of Mediterranean states red was a commonly worn colour.
Until the middle of the 19th century only officers and warrant officers in the Royal Navy wore regulated uniforms. Through the 18th century to the Napoleonic Wars navy officers had a form of dress broadly resembling that of army officers, though in dark blue with white facings. In the early 19th century Royal Navy officers developed a more distinctive form of uniform comprising (in full dress uniform) a cocked hat, dark blue coatee with white collar and cuffs, dark blue or white trousers, or breeches.
Epaulettes and braiding were gold and varied according to rank. In a simplified form this dress (without the cocked hat) survives as the modern ceremonial dress for flag officers.
Throughout this period sailors supplied or made their own clothing. Sailors developed traditional clothing suitable for their work: loose-fitting trousers with belts made of rope; tunics that slipped over the head, with arms to above the wrist so that the cloth would not foul in ropes passing through a cleat or pulley. For cold weather, a jumper was knitted from yarn or wool. For wet weather, old sail cloth was made into a coat (with hat or attached hood) that was waterproofed with tallow or fat. In these days, the officers would designate certain afternoons to &quot;make and mend&quot; (clothing). A sailor with little clothing to make or mend used this time as &quot;time off&quot;.
In January 1857 the decision was taken to issue complete uniforms to petty officers and seamen.
This included features which can still be recognised in the Class I uniform of ratings in the modern Royal Navy - notably the wide blue collar with white tapes, a black neckerchief, white lanyard and blue or white jumper. The flared &quot;bell bottom&quot; trousers disappeared after the Second World War.
Because of the global dominance of the Royal Navy from Trafalgar to the Second World War RN uniforms became the model for virtually all other navies. While certain distinctive features emerged - such as the red pompon worn on the crown of the French sailor&#x27;s cap, the open fronted jacket of the German Navy or the white round cap of the U.S. Navy - the overall pattern remained standard until the development of specialist working or protective rigs during the Second World War.

====American Civil War====
It is generally supposed that Union soldiers wore blue uniforms and Confederate soldiers wore grey ones. However, this was only a generalisation. Both the Union and the Confederacy drew up uniform regulations, but as a matter of practical reality neither side was able to fully equip its men at the outbreak of the war. Existing state units and quickly raised volunteer regiments on both sides wore a wide variety of styles and colours in the early stages of the war. Some regiments—such as the North&#x27;s Berdan Sharpshooters and the South&#x27;s Alexandria Rifles—had green uniforms, while the French zouave style was widely imitated.

The Union eventually got most of its men into regulation Federal blue but this often faded until it appeared grey. Originally the Confederate government relied on the &quot;commutation&quot; system which required the states to provide their own uniforms. While the commutation system was in place, many states were not able to provide an ample supply of uniforms and captured federal uniforms were common. Later in the war the Confederate national government provided uniforms from a central depot system, including the famous Richmond and Columbus depots. Many photographs of Confederate soldiers from later in the war (usually casualties) are wearing standardised uniforms. As Sherman&#x27;s men marched across Georgia and up the Carolinas, they were cut off from supply by the Union and began wearing clothing of Confederate origin. Confederate soldiers used a variety of vegetable and imported dyes which would fade to a &quot;butternut&quot; colour.

====End of bright colours====
Until 1914 the majority of armies still provided colourful dress uniforms for all ranks, at least for parade and off-duty wear. These often retained distinctive features from the past. Most Russian troops, for example, wore the very dark green introduced by Peter the Great in 1700. German infantry generally wore the dark &quot;Prussian blue&quot; of the previous two centuries. This and other features of the historic Prussian Army uniform were generally adopted by the other German States as they fell under Prussian influence before and after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Bavarians, however, continued to wear light blue and Saxon regiments retained a number of distinctions after the establishment of the German Empire (1871). Two regiments of the Prussian Guard and one of the Russian were still issued with the brass mitre caps of the 18th-century grenadier. The British infantry retained their scarlet tunics for parade and &quot;walking out&quot; wear, while the bulk of French regiments wore red trousers with dark or light blue tunics. The infantry of the Austro-Hungarian Empire discarded their historic white tunics in 1868 in favour of dark blue. However, the extremely large number of colours appearing on collars, cuffs, and shoulder straps to distinguish the various regiments were retained. There were for example ten shades of red, ranging from cherry red to pink. The Swedish Army had favoured dark blue with yellow facings since the beginning of the 18th century. There was infinite variety, even within smaller armies, between regiments, branches or ranks and the subject is a complex one.
The British were the first to introduce drab/khaki uniforms: in 1848 in India. This khaki drill then became more generally worn from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 both in India and Africa. A darker version, known as &quot;service drab&quot;, was adopted for home service field wear in 1902, the same year that the US Army also adopted khaki for non-dress occasions. The Italians introduced grey-green in 1909, followed by the German and Austrian armies who adopted different shades of grey. The Russians had changed to a grey shade of khaki in 1908, following their experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. There was however strong attachment to the colourful uniforms as previously worn on all occasions and the process was not an inexorable one. The Danish Army adopted grey-green uniforms for all occasions in 1903, reverted to a combination of dark and light blue in 1910, took up light grey in 1915 and finally settled for khaki in 1923. The Imperial Russian armies, following their adoption of khaki-grey field uniforms in 1908, took the opportunity to upgrade their parade uniforms to much more elaborate and colorful styles, and were experimenting with a mix of khaki and bright colours when war broke out in 1914. The Japanese Army probably went further than most in adopting khaki for all occasions after 1905, although even here officers of all branches and the cavalry of the Imperial Guard retained traditional coloured uniforms for formal and ceremonial occasions.

With the exception of Western-influenced units such as the &quot;Ever-Triumphant Army&quot; of the Taiping Rebellion (1851–66), Chinese armies of the 19th century wore dress that was broadly variegated. Embroidered chest panels and coloured buttons on headdresses were used to distinguish rank and sometimes unit. From 1910 the Imperial Chinese Army adopted dark blue uniforms of Japanese style with coloured facings of red, white, or yellow to distinguish the different branches. The Imperial Guard Division had a light grey uniform with the same branch colours as the line. A khaki summer uniform was worn by the entire army.
By the 20th century, drab colours were increasingly being adopted for active service and ordinary duty wear. The First World War finally put an end to the expensive practice of furnishing colourful uniforms to all ranks of the various armies. Amongst the frontline troops in August 1914 only the Belgian and French armies saw active service in bright colours and old fashioned headgear (although the Austro-Hungarian cavalry retained their blue and red uniforms for field wear after the remainder of the army had gone into pike grey in 1909). The Imperial German field grey of 1910 retained a number of traditional features such as spiked helmets, shakos, busbies, and coloured piping from the older uniforms. The demands of modern warfare as well as financial economy soon saw these survivals vanish, and by 1916 all involved armies were in either khaki (Russia, Turkish, Serbia, Montenegro, Japan, Greek, French colonial, and Britain), various shades of grey (German, Italian, Bulgarian, Portuguese, and Austro-Hungarian) or sky blue (French and Romanian). The coloured uniforms of peacetime were often relegated to depot wear by recruits doing their basic training.

Steel helmets first appeared in the form of the &quot;Adrian&quot; helmet adopted by the French Army in 1915. The practical advantages of this innovation led the British and German armies to adopt their own helmets by 1916. Other armies followed suit – the Belgians and Italians for example copying the French model and the Austro-Hungarians that of Germany.

=====Interwar period=====

The drab uniforms of 1914–18 remained in general use until the Second World War. This was partly for political reasons, since the republican, fascist, Nazi, and communist regimes that replaced many of the old monarchies and empires had little interest in preserving the splendours of their predecessors. However, even in those societies where there was social and political continuity the trend was away from the traditional uniforms worn prior to 1914. The British Army reintroduced full dress for Guards regiments in 1919-20 and regimental bands by 1928, while permitting officers to wear their mess (evening), blue or green &quot;patrols&quot; (semi-formal) and full dress on appropriate occasions. The French reintroduced &quot;grande tenue&quot; in 1927 for North African regiments which were mostly dependent on voluntary recruiting, and after 1930 required all regular officers to acquire dress uniforms in the pre-1914 colours of their branch or regiment. Elsewhere full or coloured dress of traditional cut was generally restricted to formal uniforms for officers and long service regulars, ceremonial guards, and a few other limited categories. The Spanish Army (which had not been involved in the First World War) exceptionally continued to issue coloured uniforms to all its conscript rank and file until 1926 and thereafter to the garrisons of Seville, Barcelona, and Madrid for special ceremonials until 1931. These included red trousers for the line infantry, following the French practice in an example of cross-border influence.

The use of steel helmets was by now almost universal and a number of countries adopted their own designs moving away from the German, British, and French models of the First World War. The Italians, Soviets, Japanese, Swiss, Spanish and Portuguese were amongst these. Steel helmets, originally simply items of utilitarian protective clothing, were adopted as parade headdress by the French, German, Italian, and Soviet armies, amongst others, between the Wars.

=====Second World War=====

Uniforms of varying shades of khaki and grey were universal in the Second World War but the cut and outline appearance of the different armies still made identification in the field relatively straight forward. A Soviet soldier would, for example be distinguishable from his German opponent by his general outline, even in the fog of battle. British, American, Japanese and French uniforms still retained some distinctive features, even as they became more and more utilitarian in the course of the War.

The US Army discarded its First World War style field uniforms in 1941 in favour of a very plain and practical combat dress in a thin light brown wool shirt (sometimes with an olive green cast) and slightly darker trousers. This was worn in conjunction with a smart olive drab &quot;Class A&quot; dress uniform—which in many cases varied to a rich &quot;chocolate&quot; brown tunic worn with khaki trousers. There was a khaki version of the Class A dress uniform for summer wear. The war started with American combat troops wearing combat shoes with &quot;spats&quot; (a form of gaiters), replaced later in the war with 2-buckle combat boots.

By contrast, British soldiers, other than officers, had their 1938 battledress for all occasions.

In Germany the Nazi regime retained uniforms with many traditional features from Imperial Germany for its army uniforms, such as field grey cloth, marching boots (a taller version for officers), collar litzen (braiding) and breeches (for officers and NCOs); German Panzer (tank) troops had a special combat uniform made of black wool and German troops serving in tropical climates had uniforms in a shade of khaki. Later in the war, severe leather shortages led to the replacement of marching boots with ankle height shoes worn with gaiters (Gemäsch).
Imperial Japan used a light brown or khaki colour for most Imperial army uniforms — though there was also a green service dress tunic for officers. Footwear was reddish brown jack boots (restricted for wear only by officers), while soldiers wore shoes with leg wrappings puttees).

From 1935 to 1943, Soviet Army uniforms for all troops (except than tank troops) were an intermediate shade of brown; uniforms included a field uniform (&quot;gymnasterka&quot; shirt with collar tabs and a 2-button breast opening, belt, breeches, garrison cap, and boots), a service dress &quot;kittel&quot; tunic worn with breeches or trousers, and a dress uniform &quot;mundir&quot; tunic (worn with deep blue breeches). Soviet tank troops wore the gymnastyrka shirt, kittel (dress tunic) in a bluish grey (rather than brown) colour. In 1943, the Soviet Army began to re-adopt many Tsarist Army features, notably braided shoulder boards, which had previously been forbidden (since the founding of the Soviet Army) as a sign of an undesirable &quot;social class&quot; mentality. The reintroduction of these epaulettes in 1943 was a relatively inexpensive means of boosting Soviet troop morale. Once reintroduced to the Soviet Army, the use of shoulder boards was never rescinded and they remained part of the uniform until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The distinct bluish grey colour for tankers was eliminated in 1943, from which point on all units of the Soviet Army wore brown.

==Modern uniforms==
Most military forces have developed several different uniform types, including combat dress, working dress, service or ordinary duty uniforms and (to a very limited extent) ceremonial full dress.

===Camouflage===
Today, all armies wear some form of camouflage uniforms for training and combat duty purposes. Armies facing service in different theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms.

===Parade===
Traditional coloured uniforms have long since given way to clothing more suited for actual combat in modern conditions. Bright colours are now usually reserved for wear by units having ceremonial functions, some bands and officers attending formal occasions. Elite units normally contrive to having some distinctive features. The United States Marine Corps are well known for their traditional midnight blue tunics and sky blue trousers (trimmed in red for NCO and above). These &quot;dress blues&quot; are worn for formal occasions such as the Marine Corps Birthday Ball in November. The British Household Cavalry and Foot Guards wear uniforms largely unchanged from 1914 for &quot;public duties&quot; i.e. ceremonial.

The military of many countries have adopted the economical expedient of smartening up combat uniforms for parade by adding medals, neck scarves and coloured berets to the terrain coloured camouflage uniforms intended for combat. As an interesting example of the combining of old and new features of uniform the French Spahis and the Spanish Regulares still wear the flowing cloaks, fezzes, turbans and sashes of the North African colonial regiments from which they are descended with modern khaki or camouflage clothing, on appropriate occasions.

===By country===
====France====

The battle dress of the French Armed Forces is the FÉLIN system combined with SPECTRA helmets. France has adopted a light beige dress uniform which is worn with coloured kepis, sashes, fringed epaulettes, fourragères and other traditional items on appropriate occasions. As an alternative parade dress, camouflage uniforms can be worn with the dress items noted above. The legionnaires of the Foreign Legion wear white kepis, blue sashes and green and red epaulettes as dress uniform, while the sappers wear the basic legionnaire uniform but with leather aprons and gloves. Troupes de marine wear blue and red kepis and yellow epaulettes. The Chasseurs Alpins wear a large beret, known as the &quot;tarte&quot; (the &quot;pie&quot;), and mountain outfits. The single remaining regiment of Spahis retains the white cloak and red sash of the days when this corps consisted of Algerian and Moroccan cavalry. 

Sailors of the French Navy and Fusiliers marins wear a dress uniform dating from the 19th century with a distinctive red pompon on the round cap.

The infantry and cavalry of the Republican Guard retain their late 19th-century dress uniforms, as do the military cadets of Saint-Cyr and the École polytechnique. A dark blue/black evening dress is authorized for officers and individual branches or regiments may parade bands or &quot;fanfares&quot; in historic dress dating as far back as the Napoleonic period.

====Germany====
The German Army has retained a form of field grey for dress wear though of modern cut and worn with berets. Some senior officers still wear peaked caps. The collar braid stripes (&quot;Litzen&quot;), that distinguished regiments of the Prussian Guard prior to 1918, have become a general feature of modern German uniforms. The Mountain infantry troops retain a more traditional dress uniform. The Nationale Volksarmee of the former German Democratic Republic also maintained a stone grey uniform, following the Imperial German tradition. Both the West and East German militaries still retained Prussian-style dress uniform respectively, with the West abandoning the &quot;Stiefelhosen&quot; (bootcut trousers).
Until 1945 &quot;Waffenrock&quot; – was the generic term for military uniform. This included dress uniforms, parade uniforms, and also epaulettes or shoulder boards with rank insignia, as well as uniform cuffs, badges and other insignia.

====India====

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the forces of the East India Company in India dyed their white summer tunics to neutral tones; initially a tan called khaki (from the Hindi word for &quot;dusty&quot;). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the Second Boer War in 1902, did the entire British Army standardise on dun for Service Dress including the British Indian Army. The modern Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.

The Indian Army camouflage uniform consists of shirts, trousers, and cap of a synthetic material. Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets, and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle camouflage dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert, and desert areas of Rajasthan and its vicinity.

Parade dress for the modern Indian Army normally involve the addition of pagris (turbans), cravats and cummerbunds in regimental colours to olive green uniforms. Gurkha, Kumaoni, Naga, Garhwali and Assam units wear wide brimmed felt hats.

====Indonesia====
The Indonesian National Armed Forces have different types of uniforms worn by its personnel for certain occasions. The uniforms are basically regulated into several categories including &quot;PDU&quot; (), which is the full dress uniform worn for attending formal state occasions; &quot;PDH&quot; (), which is the service dress uniform worn during everyday-indoor duties; &quot;PDL&quot; (), which is the combat dress uniform worn during outdoor duties; and &quot;PDP&quot; (), which is the parade dress uniform worn during military parades and other ceremonial occasions.
Each uniform category consists of different types which usually consists of type I until type IV (four types). The uniform regulations are basically different for men and women. The Army, Navy, and Air Force basically have the same regulations for the uniform, but differ in terms of color and certain designs which represent their respective branches.

====Italy====

The Italian Armed Forces use a range of different uniforms and uniform variations for each of their four branches: the Italian Army, the Italian Air Force, the Italian Navy and the Carabinieri Corps.

The traditional headdresses of the Bersaglieri, Horse Artillery and Alpini are still worn by the Italian Army, the Bersaglieri even wearing their flowing feathers on steel helmets as part of their combat dress. Officers of all branches have a dark blue dress uniform of modern cut while the Corazzieri (Cuirassiers of the Presidential Guard), Mounted Carabinieri and cadets of the Military Academy of Modena wear ceremonial uniforms which date back to the 19th century. Individual regiments with a long history, such as the &quot;Lancieri di Montebello&quot; and the &quot;Granatieri di Sardegna&quot; occasionally parade honour guards or other detachments in their pre-1915 dark blue uniforms.

====Iran====
The military of Iran uses a variety of military uniforms, including a solid olive-green pattern. Several other uniforms have also been reserved for parade use, such as a slate grey, a black and white, a beige, a beige on beige, a beige on brown, a beige on green, and an eggshell white-coloured uniform – paired with a matching beret and balaclava.

The Iranian military uses several types of camouflage patterns. Three distinct desert camouflage patterns with slightly differing colour palettes and blotch densities have been issued; one for the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, one for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and a third pattern used by the &quot;tarabaris&quot; personnel who repair military cars and trucks. A green and brown forest camouflage pattern was also issued to the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force. The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was issued an arctic blue camouflage pattern. A pixelated grey and green camouflage pattern was issued to the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy.

====Russia====
The Russian Army has retained a number of features, such as officers&#x27; epaulettes, high boots and long greatcoats with collar patches for all ranks, which can be traced back to Tsarist days. The dress uniform for officers is of the same distinctive blue/green colour as &quot;Tsar&#x27;s green&quot;, worn until 1914. The Kremlin Regiment has in recent years been issued with a special ceremonial uniform which closely resembles that of the infantry regiments of the Imperial Guard immediately prior to the First World War. Women&#x27;s uniforms in the Russian Army feature a skirt instead of trousers and a garrison cap instead of a beret or peaked cap. Since 1994 the uniform (or its main details) has undergone a series of changes in 1999, 2005, 2010, 2013 and 2017.

====Spain====
The Spanish Army has reintroduced a number of dress uniforms dating back to the pre-1931 Monarchy. These include a variety of parade uniforms worn by various units of the recreated Royal Guard as well as the traditional dark blue and white uniforms of the Guardia Civil and the blue tunics and red trousers of the 1st Infantry Regiment. While only worn by limited numbers of personnel on special occasions, these uniforms include such distinctively Spanish features as the &quot;Ros&quot; shako of the infantry and the Royal Guard, and the Tricorn of the Civil Guard. Officers of all branches wear dark blue or white gala uniforms for social and ceremonial occasions.

====United Kingdom====
The British Army generally retains its traditional full dress uniforms only for bands and units performing ceremonial functions (notably the Household Brigade). An attempt dating from the early 1950s to provide other British soldiers with a plainer (and cheaper) dark blue or green No.1 dress did not meet with much enthusiasm; indeed, most soldiers are not issued with their own No.1 dress, and the most common occasion when it is now worn is for a wedding. Parade dress for most British regiments is khaki No. 2 dress with No 1 Dress coloured peaked caps, berets or Glengarry bonnets. Following the introduction of the Combat Soldier 95 (CS95) clothing system of Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) and later Multi Terrain Pattern (MTP) this is worn for most day-to-day business replacing the old &#x27;working&#x27; uniform of green Lightweight Trousers and Shirt/Jersey, albeit that these are still used as &#x27;Barrack Dress&#x27; by some office based personnel. However, the proposed Future Army Dress (FAD), which is currently being developed by the British Army, includes a return to Barrack Dress for all arms, including &#x27;non-iron&#x27; shirts and trousers in a similar pattern to that of the current No.2 Dress uniform. Tradition is however still strong in British military culture and there are many regimental distinctions added to some uniforms. One example is the King&#x27;s Royal Hussars who wear their historic crimson trousers with all orders other than fatigue or combat dress. The &quot;trews&quot; or tartan trousers of Lowland regiments have been retained for certain orders of dress in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland, although the kilt of the Highland regiments is the parade dress. Mess dress in traditional scarlet, blue or green is worn by officers and senior NCOs of all regiments for formal evening dress.

====United States====
In recent decades, many militaries around the world have gradually simplified the range of uniforms issued. For example, most U.S. servicemen now wear camouflage utilities for daily duty and all but the most formal occasions-whereas in the past the service uniform would be worn unless a soldier was engaged in a dirty or physical task. As an example of modern practice, the United States Marine Corps has a distinct blue dress uniform, but other uniforms include khaki button-up shirts, forest-green coats, and combat camouflage. In other services where camouflage is normally a non-issue, such as navies, coloured uniforms are still issued, e.g. the United States Navy&#x27;s white officer uniform for warm weather. The United States Armed Forces allows every branch to develop and use their own uniforms. In recent years, many Battle Dress Uniforms with famous US Woodland pattern were replaced. The marine Corps developed new digital MARPAT pattern, while the United States Army developed Universal Pattern (ACU) for its standard combat uniforms, though a special camouflage pattern (multicam) more appropriate for use in Afghanistan was fielded in 2010. Popular disdain among US troops for the beret headgear as part of the &quot;default&quot; headgear for wear with the ACU uniform led to a regulation revision in 2011, with the standard &quot;default&quot; headgear for wear with ACUs now being the ACU patrol cap, which provides a much better degree of sun protection for the eyes). The U.S. Army has since developed the OCP uniform (starting in 2016), going back to a green camo pattern, with coyote brown undershirts, boots, and belt. The U.S. Army is still in transition between the old ACU pattern and the new OCP pattern. The U.S. Military uses different camo patterns when deployed in different combat zones (in theater). U.S. Army mostly uses the Multi-Cam pattern in Iraq and Afghanistan, but is subject to change due to the new OCP uniform being issued.
Based on recommendations made during a comprehensive briefing by Task Force Uniform on 24 Feb. 2006, CNO Michael G. Mullen agreed to production of both a BDU-style working uniform for all Sailors E-1 to O-10 and a more practical, year-round service uniform to withstand day-to-day classroom and office-like environments where the service uniform is typically worn. The new Navy Working Uniform (NWU) is now worn by naval sailors and officers. On 6 June 2006 the US Army announced that its green and white uniforms would be superseded by the Army Blue Uniform as a universal service uniform in the historic colours of dark blue (for tunics) and light blue (for trousers). The new service dress was introduced in 2007 and became obligatory for all ranks by 2011.

As of 1 April 2021, the Air Force makes use of the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) as a common daily uniform. This is the same uniform worn by the US Army with the exception of distinctive name patches with copper lettering. The footwear worn with ABUs are coyote brown suede boots and head covering is the OCP pattern Patrol Cap or ball cap, or the beret of the relevant career field (Security Forces, Special Operations Weather Team, SERE Instructor, Pararescue, and Combat Controller). Aside from OCPs, the most common uniform to be worn would be dress blues, which incorporate a light navy blue for bottoms, and the same shade to match the top jacket. Underneath the top jacket either a long sleeve or short sleeve sky blue shirt may be worn with a tie or neck tab whenever wearing the top jacket. The jacket is reserved for more formal events. Placed on the outermost tunic, Airmen may pin their ribbons and career badge as optional with their name plate as the only mandatory item. For headgear a flight cap of matching shade to the pants and similar in appearance to the former Army green garrison cap and the shoes are a black high polished dress shoe. Other, but not standard, headgear includes the flat top mess dress cap and the appropriate beret career field beret. Blues, though the second most used uniform, receive far less service than OCPs. Those performing duties not suited for the formal dress uniform may wear OCPs instead. The Mess Uniform uses the same pants and jacket as dress blues, but with a white under-shirt, bow tie and cummerbund, and the same black dress shoes.

==Purpose==
===Distinctive clothing===

One purpose of military uniforms is to clearly distinguish combatants who are protected by the laws of war from other persons carrying weapons, who do not always enjoy such protection.

Another purpose in historical times was to make it difficult for deserters to avoid detection; military uniforms were so distinctive with many metal buttons and unique colours that they could not be modified into unrecognisable clothing. If the commander raised and equipped the troops out of his own pocket, the appearance of the soldiers was also designed to impress his superiors.

Attractive or distinctive uniforms could make a military career desirable to young men or women (the &quot;peacock&quot; factor). As late as 1914 the British Army found that regiments with particularly striking off-duty or parade uniforms found it easier to attract recruits. Thus the four Rifle regiments in their sombre dark green had a higher public profile than the great mass of line infantry in scarlet.

====Nationalism====
During the Boxer Rebellion, the Muslim Gansu Braves under General Dong Fuxiang used traditional Chinese clothing instead of western-style uniforms, reflecting the opposition of the movement to foreign influences.

====Religion====

The patched &quot;jibba&quot;, a garment traditionally worn by followers of Sufi religious orders, was adopted as military dress in the 1880s by the Sudanese anṣār () (followers of the religious leader Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi). The Anṣār rebelled against the Turkish Ottoman rule of Sudan, due, among other reasons, to the lax religious standards of the occupation. The &quot;jibba&quot; was a ragged, patched garment which symbolised a rejection of material wealth by its wearer and a commitment to a religious way of life. Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi decreed that this garment should be worn by all his soldiers in battle. The decision to adopt the religious garment as military dress, enforced unity and cohesion among his forces, and eliminated traditional visual markers differentiating potentially fractious tribes. During the years of conflict between Mahdist and Anglo-Egyptian forces at the end of the 19th century, the Mahdist military &quot;jibba&quot; became increasingly stylised and were specifically colour-coded to denote the rank and military division of the wearer.

===Visibility or camouflage===

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the typical colour scheme included bright and highly contrasting colour arrangements which made it easier to distinguish units in battle. Coloured uniforms were useful in enabling commanders to spot troop locations on battlefields that were often completely obscured by smoke from the black gunpowder used in both muskets and cannons. Large flags were another aid to co-ordination and location for commanders.

However, with the growing prevalence of accurate rifles and other ranged firearms as standard weapons for infantry, it was found, from about the 1880s on, that these colours made soldiers easy targets for enemies to shoot at a distance. These weapons used a new smokeless powder that generated far less smoke leaving the battlefield un-obscured by smoke and making brightly coloured troops into highly visible targets. In reaction, the various militaries, beginning with the British Army, changed the colours, predominantly to such ones that blended in more with the terrain, such as khaki, grey or olive drab for the purposes of camouflage. In addition, this idea was followed with uniforms suitable for particular climates and seasons such as white for snowy regions and tan for sandy ones. Now most armies have some form of camouflaged uniform, such as the British Disruptive Pattern Material.

Many modern military forces now use a system of combat uniforms that not only break up the outline of the soldier for use on the battlefield during the daytime, but also employ a distinctive appearance that makes them difficult to detect with light amplification devices, such as night-vision goggles (NVGs). These modern &quot;digital&quot; print uniforms present a somewhat splotched appearance, generally of somewhat muted colours, that provide visual concealment in a variety of surroundings. The US Army now issues, for all theatres of operations, the Army Combat Uniform, which replaces the Battle Dress Uniform and the Desert Combat Uniform. The colour scheme on these ACUs is a faded green/grey/tan pattern of random-appearing rectangular shapes. Pocket outlines on the front of the jackets are offset from vertical, so as to present a less distinctive straight line for the eye to follow while using NVGs. The U.S. Marine Corps also issues similar uniforms with their MARPAT pattern, the U.S. Marines considered adopting CADPAT for their new pattern, however, the Canadian government owns the copyright for the pattern which it had been developing since 1988. The Canadian government supplied information and manufacturers to help the Marines with the development of their own computer-generated digital pattern pixelated uniform. Though their uniforms are not designed to replace both woodland pattern uniforms and desert pattern, since both woodland digital and desert digital patterns are available. Similarly the US Air Force has begun fielding digital pattern uniforms to their service members, with those uniforms featuring a blue/grey/tan pattern).

===Uniform of the day===

The &quot;uniform of the day,&quot; when referred to in a military sense, is the designated uniform all military personnel are required to wear on that particular day. It is often designated by the senior officer on the base. Normally the uniform is determined by the seasons (e.g. winter blues or summer whites for Navy) however, special occasions (e.g. visiting dignitaries) or weather changes may dictate changes to the uniform of the day. The uniform of the day instruction is broadcast over the 1MC at reveille on board U.S. Navy ships.

The &quot;uniform of the day&quot; may also be referred to as the &quot;dress of the day&quot; in some militaries.

===Logistics===
Mass-produced uniforms are a good way to equip thousands of soldiers quickly and efficiently. Uniforms in standard sizes and designs are also easier to replace on campaign. As an example, English levies raised for service in Ireland or the Continent during the 17th century came to be provided with clothing purchased in bulk and often of a standard colour or cut. This was however only a temporary wartime expedient and the development of uniforms as such had to wait on the formulation of a system of permanent regiments, notably by the French Monarchy (see above).

===Psychological warfare===
The appearance of the troops was often enhanced in some way to intimidate the enemy. The tall, mitre-shaped caps worn by grenadiers in the 18th century made their wearers appear bigger and more impressive. King Frederick William I of Prussia had a guard unit of especially tall men with tall mitre hats, the Potsdam Giants. Prussian hussars wore the &quot;skull and crossbones&quot; (&quot;Totenkopf&quot;) on their hats from 1740 to 1918. This tradition continues into the present day with nose art and fin flash on combat aircraft.

The warriors of ancient Sparta, normally known for their austere lifestyle, wore expensive red cloaks. Reportedly this was adopted as the only colour on which the spilled blood of their enemies would not leave stains. There is a popular myth that the historic red coat of the English soldier was adopted for the same reason (in fact, blood does show as a dark stain on red clothing and the British red coat originated as a historical accident, possibly as a result of the relative cheapness of madder red dyes at the time of the English Civil War in the mid-17th century).

Hair styles in military organisations usually follow civilian fashions, but sometimes certain features are associated with soldiers. In the late 19th century, the ornate beards and moustaches worn by the officers of the day, which complemented their rank and age, were also worn by socially equivalent civilians. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the &quot;high and tight&quot; haircut often distinguished low-ranking soldiers, particularly infantrymen, or, in the United States, Marines and Soldiers of all ranks. The principal purpose, however, of the &quot;high and tight&quot; is to prevent lice and promote general hygiene. Modern regulations against beards also ensure a good seal is made around the face when using a gas mask.

It gathers some 960,000 members, all of whom are academics or graduate professionals with a university or college degree. The members include economists, lawyers, architects, graduate engineers, doctors, scientists, teachers and many others. A growing share of Swedish union members are affiliated to a Saco union: 1% in 1950 and 18% in 2018 (pensioners and students excluded).

The organisation does not form affiliations with political parties.

<text>Giorgio Biandrata or Blandrata (15155 May 1588) was an Italian-born Transylvanian physician and polemicist, who came from the De Biandrate family, powerful from the early part of the 13th century. He was an antitrinitarian.

Biandrata was born in Saluzzo, the youngest son of Bernardino Biandrata. He graduated in arts and medicine at Montpellier in 1533, and specialized in the functional and nervous disorders of women. In 1544 he made his first trip to Transylvania; in 1553 he was with Giovanni Paolo Alciati in the Grisons; in 1557 he spent a year at Geneva, in constant contact with Calvin, who distrusted him.

He attended Jane Stafford, English wife of Count Celso Massimiliano Martinengo, preacher of the Italian church at Geneva, and fostered anti-trinitarian opinions in that church. In 1558 he found it expedient to move to Poland, where he became a leader of the heretical party at the synods of Pińczów (1558) and Książ Wielkopolski (1560 and 1562). His point was the suppression of extremes of opinion, on the basis of a confession literally drawn from Scripture.

He obtained the position of court physician to the queen dowager, the Milanese Bona Sforza. She had been instrumental in the burning (1539) of Catharine Weygel, at the age of 80, for anti-trinitarian opinions; but the writings of Ochino had altered her views, which were now anti-Catholic.

In 1563 Biandrata transferred his services to the Transylvanian court of John Sigismund Zápolya, where the daughters of his patroness were married to ruling princes. He revisited Poland (1576) in the train of Stephen Báthory, whose tolerance permitted the propagation of heresies; and when (1579) Christopher Báthory introduced the Jesuits into Transylvania, Biandrata found means of conciliating them.

Throughout his career he was accompanied by his two brothers, Ludovico and Alphonso, the former being canon of Saluzzo. In Transylvania, Biandrata co-operated with Francis David (d. 1579), the leader of the Calvinist church, who then became the first anti-trinitarian bishop. Together, they published some polemical writings against Trinitarian belief, particularly &quot;De falsa et vera unius Dei Patris, Filii et Spiritus Sancti cognitione&quot;, which is largely a summarized version of Servetus&#x27;s &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot;. But in 1578 two circumstances broke the connection. Biandrata was charged with immorality and David renounced the necessity of invoking Christ in prayer.

To influence David, Biandrata sent for Faustus Socinus from Basel. Socinus was David&#x27;s guest, but the discussion between them led to no result. At the instance of Biandrata, David was tried and condemned to prison at the Fortress of Deva on the charge of &quot;innovation&quot;, where he died.

Having amassed a fortune, Biandrata returned to the communion of Rome. His end is obscure. According to the Jesuit, Jakub Wujek, he was strangled by a nephew (Giorgio, son of Alphonso) at Gyulafehérvár, in May 1588.

Gary W. Jenkins calls Biandrata the &quot;tritheist apostle to the Poles,&quot; and suggests that Valentine Gentili was his Silas.

<doc id="977388" wikidata="Q2691837" url="?curid=977388" title="Demon Princes">
<text>Demon Princes is a series of five science fiction novels by Jack Vance, which cumulatively relate the story of Kirth Gersen, a man trained by his grandfather to exact revenge on five notorious interstellar crime bosses, collectively known as the Demon Princes, who carried the people of his village off into slavery during his childhood. Each novel deals with his pursuit of one of the five Princes.

==Novels==
* &quot;Star King&quot; (1964). The first target of Gersen&#x27;s revenge is Attel Malagate, a renegade from a species called the Star Kings. The Star Kings can consciously evolve themselves and are driven to imitate and surpass the most successful species they encounter. With their contact with humanity, they begin making themselves into imitations of human beings. Gersen traps Malagate with an undeveloped and fantastically beautiful planet whose location is known only to Gersen. Malagate covets the planet in order to become the father of a new race that can outdo both humans and his own species.
* &quot;The Killing Machine&quot; (1964). Kokor Hekkus has prolonged his life by the vivisection of human beings to obtain hormones and other substances from their living bodies. Not content with just one life, he has converted the lost planet Thamber into a stage where he acts out his fantasies.
* &quot;The Palace of Love&quot; (1967). Viole Falushe is so obsessed with a girl from his youth that he created a number of clones of her in a vain attempt to psychologically manipulate one into returning his love. Gersen, disguised as a journalist, travels to Falushe&#x27;s planet, where the Demon Prince has built an entire civilization acknowledging him as its supreme ruler.
* &quot;The Face&quot; (1979). Gersen pursues Lens Larque, a sadist and monumental trickster, to various planets. He uncovers Larque&#x27;s most grandiose scheme: terraforming a moon into the shape of his laughing face to avenge a slight.
* &quot;The Book of Dreams&quot; (1981). Gersen foils several schemes by Howard Alan Treesong, already the head of the underworld across the galaxy, to take over the most powerful of humanity&#x27;s organizations.

==Publication history==
The first three books in the series appeared in 1964-67 and were published in both hard cover and mass-market paperback editions under the Berkley Medallion imprint. There was a 12-year gap before the last two appeared in 1979 and 1981 and published as individual volumes in limited editions of 700 copies each by Underwood-Miller in 1981. The collected books were published as a limited edition set, &quot;The Demon Princes&quot;, in 1997. The &quot;Demon Princes&quot; books were republished by Spatterlight Press in 2016 as paperback volumes using the author-preferred text from the Vance Integral Edition.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Star King&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #99, and stated that &quot;The revenge plot is banal in the extreme, but the pace is headlong and it&#x27;s impossible not to admire the backdrop.&quot; Arthur Jean Cox reviewed &quot;Star King&quot; in the August 1964 issue of &quot;Riverside Quarterly&quot;.

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;The Face&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #1. Costikyan commented that &quot;All in all, &quot;The Face&quot; is an intriguing and well-plotted adventure in Vance&#x27;s usual strange style. It is also considerably more expert and cleanly written than most of Vance&#x27;s other work; apparently, Vance is still refining his style and sharpening his abilities. &quot;The Face&quot; is well worth reading, especially if you can get hold of the previous three novels in the &#x27;Demon Princes&#x27; series.&quot;

<text>Wrestling shoes are a type of activewear that is primarily used in competition and practice for the sport of wrestling. They are also used in mixed martial arts and professional wrestling. These shoes are designed to be light and flexible, providing ankle support and traction. They help to minimize the risk of injuries, such as foot infections or accidental toenail injuries to the opponent. That&#x27;s why wrestling shoes usually have a high-top design that provides extra cushioning and support to the ankles.

To ensure the best performance, wrestling shoes should fit snugly to your foot, be lightweight, and promote flexibility of movement. Some powerlifters also find wrestling shoes useful when lifting because of their minimal shock absorption.

<text>A sobriquet ( ) is a descriptive nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. A sobriquet is distinct from a pseudonym in that it is typically a familiar name used in place of a real name without the need for explanation; it may become more familiar than the original name.

An example is Mohandas Gandhi, who is better known as Mahatma Gandhi (&quot;mahatma&quot; means &quot;great soul&quot; in Sanskrit). 

The term &quot;sobriquet&quot; is equally applicable as a name for a person, group of people, historical event, or place. Well-known places often have sobriquets, such as New York City, often called the &quot;Big Apple&quot;, or Rome, the &quot;Eternal City&quot; , or Vienna, the &quot;Golden Apple&quot;.

The modern French and English spelling is . Two earlier variants are and . The first variant, &quot;soubriquet&quot; dates from the 15th century and is rarely used now, in English or French.

The early 14th-century &quot;soubzsbriquez&quot; meant a &quot;little blow under the chin&quot;, also described as a chuck under the chin; this was derived from &quot;soubs&quot;, mod. &quot;sous&quot; (), under.

== Usage ==
Sobriquets are &quot;a form of identification that goes beyond a traditional name and offers insight into a person’s character, appearance, profession, or any other distinguishing feature&quot;. They are used in politics, music, literature and for royalty, celebrities, and athletes. 

Candidates for public office and political figures may be described with sobriquets, while living or posthumously. For example, president of the United States Abraham Lincoln was called &quot;Honest Abe&quot;. An affectionate contemporary sobriquet for Ulysses S. Grant was the &quot;American Sphinx&quot; as a man of deeds rather than for verbal self-promotion.

Early uses of sobriquets in writing and literature include the Dead Sea Scrolls and in Tang and Song (Southern Sung) dynasty poetry. Contemporary usage is common in the English and French languages.

<text>Trevor Brown (born 1959) is an English artist from London but based in Japan. His &quot;occasionally shocking&quot; work explores issues of paraphilia.

==Life and work==
Brown has been living and working in Japan since 1994.

His work explores paraphilias, such as lolicon, ero guro, BDSM, and other fetish themes. Innocence, violence, misogyny, and Japanese popular culture all collide in Brown&#x27;s art.

Early features on Trevor Brown&#x27;s art appeared in Adam Parfrey&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Culture II&quot;, Shade Rupe&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Party 2&quot;, and in Jim Goad&#x27;s &quot;ANSWER Me!&quot; zine. Since then his interviews and art have been featured in numerous publications worldwide, most recently on the cover of &quot;Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible&quot; in Japan. His work also appears on a variety of book and record covers. He has illustrated for Coup de Grace an edition of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Der Antichrist&quot;. Brown has also had several books of his art published.

<doc id="977409" wikidata="Q352540" url="?curid=977409" title="Michael Pitt">
<text>Michael Carmen Pitt (born April 10, 1981) is an American actor, model, and musician.
In film, he has appeared in &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; (2001), &quot;Bully&quot; (2001), &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (2002), &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003), &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005), &quot;Silk&quot; (2007), &quot;Funny Games&quot; (2007), &quot;I Origins&quot; (2014), and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (2017). In television, he portrayed Henry Parker in the teen drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1999–2000), Jimmy Darmody in the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (2010–2011), and Mason Verger in the second season of the NBC series &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Pitt was born in West Orange, New Jersey, the son of Donald B. Pitt, an auto mechanic, and Eleanor Carol (née DeMaio) Pitt, a waitress. He has two older sisters and one older brother. Pitt is of Italian and Irish heritage on his mother&#x27;s side, and of English descent on his father&#x27;s. By age 16, Pitt had been to three or four high schools, among them Morris Catholic High School, and was in &quot;special classes&quot; before ultimately dropping out. He also did a brief stint at the Essex County Youth House, a detention center.

==Career==

===Film===
In 2001, Pitt earned a breakout role as Tommy Gnosis, the lover of a trans rock star named Hedwig, in the film &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot;, an adaptation of John Cameron Mitchell&#x27;s 1998 stage musical. Although not his first film role, Pitt&#x27;s performance as Gnosis led to a series of supporting roles in many acclaimed and often controversial films, including &quot;Bully&quot; (2001), &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot; (2002), and the 2007 remake of &quot;Funny Games&quot;. One of Pitt&#x27;s more notable roles was as the lead in &quot;The Dreamers&quot; (2003).

Pitt attributes his success in films to a combination of hard work and the presence of &quot;a few angels in my life.&quot; He has also stressed that he chooses roles not with the hope that they will garner commercial success or to gain notoriety but to create art, challenge the audience, and ultimately contribute to a project that he is proud of: 
To be honest, I make very controversial films. The films that I&#x27;ve made have been very, very bold choices. As the years go by, I think my work is going to come more and more in context. The truth is that you can&#x27;t take what people say too seriously. If I cared what people think about my career, I would have not done—just look at my work. Don&#x27;t look at me, look at what I&#x27;ve done. Every movie that I&#x27;ve picked, from my first film on, has been considered by everyone to be &quot;career suicide.&quot; And I have an amazing life. I have an amazing career. I work with artists. But I&#x27;m not making Spider-Man.

In 2004, Pitt has also appeared in &quot;The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; and &quot;The Village&quot; and in 2005 starred in &quot;Last Days&quot; as a rock musician &quot;inspired&quot; by Nirvana frontman, Kurt Cobain. He performed all of the songs, which closely resembled Cobain&#x27;s guitar and singing styles.

On the set of &quot;Last Days&quot;, he met Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, who had been hired by Van Sant to serve as the film&#x27;s music consultant. The pair formed a close bond, with Moore writing, &quot;[Gus] wanted me to hang out with Michael and talk about his character, and let him be in character. We ended up spending a lot of time together. My daughter Coco still relates to Michael as Blake from &quot;Last Days&quot;&quot;.

In 2006, he starred in the unconventional romantic comedy &quot;Delirious&quot; as a young homeless man who befriends a celebrity photographer and falls in love with a pop singer. The movie appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The following year, he played opposite Keira Knightley in &quot;Silk&quot;, adapted from the novel by Alessandro Baricco, as Hervé Joncour, a French silkworm smuggler, who falls in love with a baron&#x27;s concubine while in Japan.
In 2014, Pitt juggled two starring roles, as Tommy Uva in the comedic American crime drama &quot;Rob the Mob&quot; and as a molecular biologist in search of the truth about the origins of the eye in the science fiction romantic drama &quot;I Origins&quot;.

In 2017, Pitt starred in the film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; as the villainous hacker Kuze, alongside Scarlett Johansson.

===Theater===
Pitt made his Off-Broadway debut in 1999 in the play &quot;The Trestle at Pope Lick Creek&quot; at the New York Theatre Workshop.

===Television===
During his theater debut, a casting agent whom Pitt had mistaken for a police officer attempting to arrest him noticed him and recommended him for a role on the television series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek.&quot; He played Henry Parker on a recurring basis in the third season (1999–2000).

In 2010, Pitt was cast as Jimmy Darmody in the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (about the rise of Atlantic City during the Prohibition era), as the protégé of corrupt politician Nucky Thompson. He appeared in the show&#x27;s first two seasons and was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics&#x27;s Choice Award for his performance. Pitt said of Boardwalk Empire, &quot;I&#x27;m proud of the work we did on that show. My grandfather was an Italian-American and he met my grandmother in Atlantic City. So Jimmy Darmody spoke to me; he felt very close to home.&quot;

In 2014, he was cast in the recurring role of Mason Verger in the NBC series &quot;Hannibal&quot; playing the role in the show&#x27;s second season. He subsequently left and was replaced by Joe Anderson.

===Music===

Pitt sang and played guitar in his band, Pagoda, whose self-titled debut album was released by Universal/Fontana/Ecstatic Peace in 2007.

Under the title Jimi Pitt and the Twins of Evil, Pitt performed &quot;Hey Joe&quot; with the Twins of Evil for &quot;The Dreamers&quot; soundtrack.

===Directing===
In January 2015, Pitt made his official directorial debut with a campaign film for fashion label Rag &amp; Bone&#x27;s Spring 2015 collection. The video features Pitt and prior co-stars actress Astrid Bergès-Frisbey—the new face of Rag &amp; Bone womenswear—and British actor Stephen Graham, from &quot;I Origins&quot; and &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, respectively. Says Rag &amp; Bone co-head, Marcus Wainwright, &quot;[Pitt]&#x27;s a really talented actor and musician, and he came to us with this concept of doing a film-based campaign. We thought it was awesome and well worth trying.&quot; Pitt has also directed a number of music videos for Pagoda.

In 2020, he revealed he had recently directed a film in Italy called &quot;Nocturnal&quot;, although there is no release date set yet.

===Modeling===
Pitt has modeled for numerous designer campaigns. In 2012, he was named the face of Italian fashion house Prada and modeled their menswear line. He was also featured in two separate Rag &amp; Bone campaigns prior to the release of his self-directed campaign—once for Fall/Winter 2013, with French actress Léa Seydoux, and once for Fall/Winter 2014, with actress Winona Ryder.

==Personal life==
Pitt had previously been engaged to Asia Argento from 2003 to 2004. In 2009, Pitt revealed that he had been &quot;engaged for a long time now&quot; to model Jamie Bochert and said of her: &quot;She&#x27;s my other half.&quot; The two ended their relationship in 2014.

In July 2022, Pitt was arrested and charged with assault and petty larceny after allegedly hitting another man multiple times and taking his phone. In September, Pitt was hospitalized and deemed &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; after being accused of throwing items at people from the rooftop of a building.

<text>Andreas Thorkildsen (born 1 April 1982) is a retired Norwegian track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. He was the Olympic Champion in 2004 and 2008, European Champion in 2006 and 2010, and World Champion in 2009. He is the first male javelin thrower in history to simultaneously be European, World and Olympic Champion. He was also a three-time silver medalist at the World Championships, placing second in 2005, 2007 and 2011. His personal best of 91.59 m, set in 2006, is the Norwegian record.

==Personal life==
Thorkildsen&#x27;s father Tomm Thorkildsen is a former javelin thrower, achieving a personal best throw of 71.64 metres in 1974. His mother Bente (née Amundsen) became national champion in the 100 metres hurdles in 1972, representing Hamar IL. He has one older brother. He took his secondary education at Kristiansand Cathedral School.

;Relationship with Christina Vukicevic
Thorkildsen&#x27;s relationship with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity on his part. When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won kongepokalen for men and women respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom he had shown the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media that they no longer were a couple.

;Modelling
In 2007, Thorkildsen performed as a fashion model for former footballer Martin Dahlin, fronting his winter and autumn collections.

==Career==

Thorkildsen took up javelin throwing at the age of 11, and was coached by his father Tomm until 1999. He established numerous national boys&#x27; records as a teenager. In 1996 he set a national record for the 14 years&#x27; class (53.82 m), in 1998 for the 16 years&#x27; class (61.57 m), in 1999 for the 17 years&#x27; class (72.11 m), and in 2000 a record for the 18 years&#x27; class (77.48 m). In 1999 he finished seventh at the European Junior Championships.

In 2000 Thorkildsen took his first medal at the Norwegian championships, finishing in silver medal position behind Ronny Nilsen. His form earned Thorkildsen his first call-up to the Norwegian European Cup team. In October he participated at the World Junior Championships and received a silver medal behind winner Gerhardus Pienaar from South Africa.

===2001–2003===
In 2001 Thorkildsen moved to Oslo and started competing for the club SK Vidar under coach Åsmund Martinsen, a former javelin thrower who won the bronze medal at the 1994 Norwegian Championships, and had a career best throw of 68.12 metres. The cooperation proved fruitful as Thorkildsen soon broke the 80 metre barrier, throwing 83.87 metres at Fana stadion in June. This was a world junior record till 2011. Participating in his second European Junior Championships, he won a silver medal behind Aleksandr Ivanov. Both competed at the World Championships in Edmonton, but while Ivanov managed to reach the final, Thorkildsen finished last in the entire competition with only 68.41 metres. When asked to comment on his own throwing he described it as &quot;completely awful&quot;.

At the national level Thorkildsen became Norwegian champion for the first time. In August he competed in a discus throw meet at Sognsvann, establishing a personal best of 38.02 metres. He has not competed on national level in other athletic events.

In 2002, he recorded a season best of 83.43 metres in June before witnessing his form gradually declining over the next months. At his first European Championships, which were held in August in Munich, he again failed to progress from the qualifying round. With a best throw of 78.36 metres he finished fifteenth overall, 68 centimetres behind Ari Pakarinen who secured the last spot in the final. Although Thorkildsen only managed to take silver at the Norwegian championships behind Pål Arne Fagernes, his result of 83.43 metres was enough to front the national top list in javelin throw for the first time.

Next year he finished eleventh at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, his first major international final. His performance and throw of 77.75 metres was slightly disappointing as he had thrown 79.44 metres in the qualifying round, having travelled to Paris with a personal best of 85.72 metres, established in June in Ventspils. On the lighter side he took his second national title, consolidating his spot as Norway&#x27;s leading javelin thrower.

===2004===
In 2004 Thorkildsen faced competition from Ronny Nilsen, who threw 84.73 metres in May. Although Thorkildsen did not retake the national number one spot right away, he did display increasing form in the preparations for the Olympic Games. He qualified for the Olympics with an 84.12 m throw at the Bergen Bislett Games, an event which was won by Breaux Greer with a North American record and world leading throw of 87.39 metres. On 27 July Thorkildsen took his first victory in an IAAF Grand Prix meet, beating Breaux Greer by a comfortable margin at the DN Galan meet in Stockholm. Three days later he improved his season best to 84.45 metres at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace.

Even though several throwers, including Nilsen, still towered above Thorkildsen on the world list, the Olympic javelin contest was regarded as widely open – &quot;one of the most open finals in Olympic history&quot;, according to the IAAF Olympic coverage. Thorkildsen threw 81.74 m in the qualification round, barely earning a mention in the event report as he safely passed the automatic qualifier mark of 81 metres to go through to the final. Breaux Greer won the qualification with 87.25 m, but left the stadium in a limping state. In the javelin final held two days later, Thorkildsen opened with an 84.82 m release which saw him ranked third at the end of the first round. Vadims Vasiļevskis of Latvia had thrown a personal best of 84.95 m to earn a surprising lead ahead of reigning World champion Sergey Makarov. In the second round Thorkildsen threw a personal best of 86.50 metres. As neither Aleksandr Ivanov, Greer nor anyone else managed to beat this, Thorkildsen won a surprising Olympic gold medal with Vasiļevskis and Makarov staying in place to take the silver and bronze medals respectively. Thorkildsen became the second Norwegian man to win the Olympic gold medal in javelin throw, after Egil Danielsen in 1956. Commenting on his win, Thorkildsen described the feeling as &quot;completely insane&quot;. A second place behind Breaux Greer at the World Athletics Final in Monte Carlo rounded off the season.

===2005===
The most important event of 2005 was the World Championships. The preparations for this event looked promising for Thorkildsen as he improved his personal best to 86.82 metres in Kuortane in June, beating the Norwegian record of Pål Arne Fagernes. Tero Pitkämäki from Finland, who achieved a world leading result of 91.53 metres in the same competition, seemed a likely contender for the world champion title. In July, When Thorkildsen further improved his national record to 87.66 metres at the Bislett Games, reigning world champion Sergey Makarov had already thrown 90.33 metres two weeks earlier at the Russian Championships in Tula. Going into the World Championships, Pitkämäki was still in first place on the world top list ahead of Makarov and Thorkildsen, who in turn was ahead of Breaux Greer by one centimetre.

In the qualification round at the World Championships, held in windy conditions on the Helsinki Olympic Stadium, only Pitkämäki, Makarov and Thorkildsen managed to beat the automatic qualification mark of 81 metres. Rain supplemented the wind the following day, constituting difficult weather conditions for the javelin final. Thorkildsen, in the lead after three rounds with 86.18 metres, eventually finished in silver medal position behind Andrus Värnik of Estonia as the latter threw 87.17 metres in the fourth round.

Pitkämäki, who finished a disappointing fourth at the World Championships, bounced back to win the World Athletics Final ahead of Thorkildsen, despite the latter improving his national record to 89.60 metres. 89.60 metres was enough to finish third on the world top list that season, behind Pitkämäki and Makarov.

===2006–2008===

In 2006 Thorkildsen returned to his original club Kristiansands IF, having represented SK Vidar in competitions the five previous seasons. In May he broke the 90 metre barrier for the first time, with 90.13 metres from the Doha Super Grand Prix. At the Bislett Games he yet again improved his record to 91.59 metres, reaching his goal of 300 feet. As no one managed to top his 91.59 metre result, he entered the 2006 European Championships as a favorite, together with Tero Pitkämäki who had won the IAAF Golden League meet in Paris. Thorkildsen won the event with 88.78 metres, having led the competition since the second round. Thorkildsen finished the season by winning his first World Athletics Final as well as the 2006 IAAF World Cup. With 91.59 metres he finished on top of the world list for the first time.

Thorkildsen&#x27;s main goals for the 2007 season were the Bislett Games and the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, as well as 
winning the Golden League jackpot. In addition he aimed to beat the old record of Terje Pedersen, who threw 91.72 metres with the old javelin implement, by throwing in the range of 93 to 94 metres. The season started in a mediocre manner as he threw 81.10 metres in Dakar and 86.39 m in Doha. He recovered his form at the world championships, but once again could only achieve a silver medal, this time losing to Pitkämäki finally fulfilling his potential with a throw of 90.33 (though he&#x27;d already been assured the medal by this point).

In 2008 Thorkildsen won the Golden League event at Bislett in Oslo, his main goal besides the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He won a gold medal in the Olympics where he set a new Olympic record with 90.57 metres. Thorkildsen dominated the competition, leading it from his first throw and making the two longest throws in the competition without using his last attempt. All of his 5 throws would have given a medal. Thorkildsen also won the javelin competition of the 2008 IAAF Golden League in Zürich on 29 August.

===2009–2016===
He became the first male javelin thrower in history to hold all three titles of European champion, World champion and Olympic champion, winning IAAF World Championship in Berlin with 89.59 m. Thorkildsen also had the season&#x27;s leading throw, with 91.28 m achieved in Zürich on 28 August.

He opened his 2010 season with a large throw of 90.37 metres at the Florö Track &amp; Field Festival in May and went on to score a victory over Pitkämäki in their first match up in the 2010 IAAF Diamond League at the Bislett Games, finishing with a best throw of 86.00 m. On 31 July he defended his European title with a throw of 88.37, finishing ahead of second-placed Matthias de Zordo. De Zordo got his revenge next year when he won World Championship on 3 September at Daegu with Thorkildsen finishing second with a throw of 84.78.

In 2012 Thorkildsen finished fourth at European Championships in Helsinki only managing three throws with the best result of 81.55 metres after picking up an injury during warm-up. This was the first time since 2003 that Thorkildsen failed to win a medal at a major championship. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London he threw 82.63 and finished sixth which became fifth several years later after disqualification of the original silver medalist Oleksandr Pyatnytsya for doping offence. Next year&#x27;s World Championships at Moscow brought Thorkildsen a sixth place with a throw of 81.06 in what turned out to be his last appearance at a major championship competition. Injuries forced him to bring his 2014 season to a premature end before the European Championships. He later decided to sit out the entire 2015 season but aimed at comeback in 2016. However, in May 2016 Thorkildsen announced his retirement from sports.

==Awards==
At the end of 2004 Thorkildsen was selected Norwegian Sportsperson of the Year by Norwegian sports journalists.

In 2008 he was awarded the European Athlete of the Year trophy by the European Athletic Association, announced on 2 October 2008, and to be presented at the European Athletics Awards Dinner in Amsterdam on 18 October. The Association cited Thorkildsen&#x27;s success at the Beijing Olympics and his breaching of the 90-metre barrier as part of their reasoning for the award.

<text>TV3, owned and operated by Medford Community Cablevision, Inc., is a public-access television channel serving Medford, Massachusetts. It was created by mandate of the 1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act. The channel&#x27;s current facilities are located at 5 High Street, under then-U.S. Representative (and present-day United States Senator) Ed Markey&#x27;s office in Medford Square. Medford Community Cablevision oversees the community&#x27;s public access television on Comcast channel 3. It functions as both a production facility as well as a telecast station. In 2010 the station unveiled new services to the community including video on demand and 24/7 streaming video services on its website.

Medford Community Cablevision has been recognized by the Alliance for Community Media in 2008 and 2011 for &quot;Overall Excellence in Public Television&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.allcommunitymedia.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the station announced Medford Cable News, the city&#x27;s first non-profit broadcast news station.

==History==
TV3 is an independent corporation contracted by the city to provide public cable access. It is funded with 1% of Comcast&#x27;s Medford revenue. Community Cablevision, Inc. is run by a thirteen seat Board of Directors of whom four are elected by the station&#x27;s paid membership, one is appointed by the Mayor, and the other seven are appointed by existing board members. Some board members serve for many years. The station was founded in 1984.

In the 2000s, critics accused the station of being controlled by a small cabal of insiders. In 2008, the station&#x27;s General Manager Dawn Natalia resigned. In 2009, an investigating commission found that the station had produced 13 films starring board members while neglecting to broadcast a popular local parade, and recommended that the chairman of the station&#x27;s board be replaced and that the station reform its finances and management; however, the commission, presided over by a retired judge, was not empowered to make legally binding rulings.

==Programming==
Over the decades, TV3 Medford has had programming including game shows, movie review, talk radio, entertainment, music, religion, finance, and politics. In 2010, the station added multi-language programming in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Russian.

From 2009 to 2011, TV3 Medford featured a children&#x27;s television block that ran weekdays and weekends from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m.

The 2007 program &quot;Energy Smackdown&quot; was a reality game show in which three Medford families competed to reduce home energy use.
The station also airs syndicated programs such as &quot;Hot &amp; Cold&quot;, &quot;Saturday Fright Special&quot;, and syndicated programs created by Robert Greenwald.

===Notable guests===
In 2010, the original program &quot;Inside the Music&quot;, produced by saxophonist Deric Dyer, featured musician and former &quot;SNL&quot; singer Christine Ohlman. Deric Dyer has been associated with Tina Turner and Joe Cocker for more than two decades.
Long-running controversial late-night show &quot;Zapp TV&quot; was first broadcast live on 40 Canal Street in Medford. Since then, the show has tackled many local and mainstream topics. Other notable guests included politician Joseph L. Kennedy.
The third sports program to air on TV3, &quot;Real Grass Real Heroes&quot;, hosted by sports writer and television announcer Jim Tuberosa, features sports figures and sports writers from many generations. In 2010, the program welcomed WBZ-TV sportscaster Bob Lobel, long-time sports announcer and former 1960s Baltimore Colts executive, Upton Bell, pro ice hockey player Rick Middleton, and world welterweight boxing champion Tony DeMarco.

===Controversial program===
On April 8, 2010, the one-run program &quot;Dirty Talk Live: Sex Advice, and Naughty Stories&quot; aired on TV3 at 8:00 p.m. and sparked controversy among residents, politicians, and local media. The program was a live call-in format featuring a sex therapist, a panel of young adults, and a dominatrix. The program was uncensored and unedited which led to TV3 being called out for lewdness. On the screen, there was a still image of two &quot;scantily clad&quot; women kissing. In the corner of the screen, &quot;they had a picture of a squirrel standing erect with a part of the male anatomy sticking out&quot;; audio of two women discussing sexual matters played over the image on the screen.

Medford Council President Robert Maiocco claimed &quot;It was flat-out pornographic. This wasn&#x27;t just regular locker room talk, it was obscene. It&#x27;s what even the Supreme Court has ruled as being pornographic.&quot; Councilor Robert Penta in a rage shouted over a City Council Meeting to the TV3 management that &quot;you are sick to allow that to be broadcast over Channel 3.&quot; TV3&#x27;s Director of Operations Daniel Sarno defended the content of the program, telling Fox News &quot;anything that is protected under the First Amendment is fair game on public access television&quot;. The media attention lasted approximately one week.
