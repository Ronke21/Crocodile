<doc id="1004821" wikidata="Q1074321" url="?curid=1004821" title="Dance of the Vampires (musical)">
<text>Dance of the Vampires is a musical adaptation of the 1967 Roman Polanski film (known as &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; in the United States). Polanski also directed the musical’s original German-language production (titled ). The music was composed by Jim Steinman, orchestrated by Steve Margoshes, and Michael Kunze wrote the original German book and lyrics.

==Plot==
Note: This synopsis applies to European and Japanese productions only. The Broadway version was heavily rewritten. In addition, portions of this synopsis may reflect later changes to the European show, which will become clear when reading the song list below.

===Act I===
Sometime in the late 19th century, Professor Abronsius and Alfred, his bumbling young assistant, arrive in a small Jewish shtetl somewhere in the Carpathians, where they hope to prove the professor&#x27;s theory that vampires exist. Nearly freezing to death in the nearby woods (&quot;He, Ho, He&quot;), the two are taken in by Chagal, an innkeeper who spends most of his free time lusting after Magda, his beautiful chambermaid, much to the disdain of his long-suffering wife, Rebecca (&quot;Knoblauch&quot; – &quot;Garlic&quot;). The professor, upon noticing the countless strings of garlic hung about the place and around people&#x27;s necks, is overjoyed, confident of the nearness of his goal, and immediately starts probing Chagal for information. The villagers, evidently frightened, pretend to be completely oblivious, silencing the local fool, who still manages to blurt something about the castle and the count that lives there. 
After exploring the rooms upstairs in which they are staying (&quot;Bitte, meine Herren&quot; – &quot;Please, Gentlemen&quot;), Alfred discovers and is smitten by Chagal&#x27;s beautiful seventeen-year-old daughter, Sarah. Chagal is very protective of his child, going as far as boarding up her room so she wouldn&#x27;t bathe around the two guests (&quot;Eine schöne Tochter ist ein Segen&quot; – &quot;A Beautiful Daughter is a Blessing&quot;). That night, Alfred and Sarah sing of their mutual attraction, while Chagal tries to coerce his way into Magda&#x27;s bed and Abronsius is swiftly knocked on the head by Chagal&#x27;s wife (&quot;Nie geseh&#x27;n&quot; – &quot;Never Seen&quot;). Unbeknownst to Alfred, late at night Sarah is serenaded by a mysterious stranger, who promises her eternal life and power (&quot;Gott ist tot,&quot; – God is Dead&quot;).

The next morning, the Professor bears witness to a small business exchange between Chagall and Koukol, a hideous hunchback living somewhere in the woods (&quot;Alles ist hell&quot; – &quot;Everything&#x27;s Bright&quot;). He inquires about the odd man (&quot;Wahrheit&quot; – &quot;truth&quot;), but Chagal refuses to discuss the matter. That same night, Sarah tricks Alfred into giving up his bath for her (&quot;&quot;Du bist wirklich sehr nett&quot; – &quot;You&#x27;re Really Very Nice&quot;) and as she joyfully soaps her sponge, Count von Krolock, an aristocratic vampire, breaks into the bathroom from the roof above and invites her to a midnight ball at his castle (&quot;&quot;Einladung zum Ball&quot; – &quot;Invitation to the Ball&quot;). He is about to bite the girl, but Alfred, who has been spying on Sarah&#x27;s bathing ritual, screams for help. Chagal and Rebecca arrive, furious. Sarah&#x27;s father spanks her and forbids her to ever go outside.

However, later that night, Koukol arrives at the inn and leaves a red bundle for Sarah on the doorstep. She sneaks outside and discovers it to be a pair of expensive red boots. Alfred comes outside as well and professes his love to her (&quot;Draußen ist Freiheit&quot; – &quot;Outside is Freedom&quot;). The two plan on running off together and Sarah asks Alfred to go back into the house to fetch her sponge. With Alfred gone, Sarah fantasizes about the fantastical, romantic vampire ball she could be missing and decides to accept the Count&#x27;s invitation (&quot;Stärker als wir sind&quot; – &quot;Stronger Than We Are&quot;). She runs off into the woods. Alfred starts to panic, Chagal and Rebecca rush outside, but it&#x27;s too late and Sarah&#x27;s gone. Chagal wraps himself in garlic and runs into the woods after his daughter.

The next morning, Chagal&#x27;s frozen body is found; Rebecca is devastated (&quot;Trauer um Chagal&quot; – &quot;Mourning for Chagal&quot;). Professor Abronsius discovers small puncture wounds all over the body, but the villagers, still in denial, incorrectly assume they came from wolf bites. The Professor hands Rebecca a wooden stake and explains she must puncture Chagal&#x27;s heart in order to prevent him from becoming a vampire. Hysterical, Rebecca chases him and Alfred out of the room, covering her husband with a bed sheet and swearing that she would never let anyone violate his corpse.

In the middle of the night, Magda sneaks downstairs to look at Chagal&#x27;s corpse, expressing mixed feelings about his death (&quot;Tot zu sein ist komisch&quot; - &quot;To be Dead is Strange&quot;). Suddenly, Chagal sits up, now a vampire. Magda tries to fend him off with a crucifix, but being a Jewish vampire, he manages to overpower her and feed on her blood, killing her in the process. Alfred and the Professor sneak into the room as well, planning to stake Chagal, but they find Magda&#x27;s body there instead. A chase ensues and the two finally corner Chagal, who begs for mercy and promises to show them the route to the vampire&#x27;s castle where his daughter supposedly is held if he&#x27;s spared.

Chagal leads the two heroes to a giant castle in the woods (&quot;Durch die Wildnis zum Schloß&quot; – &quot;Through the Wilderness to the Castle&quot;), where they are greeted by the mysterious Count von Krolock and his flamboyant son Herbert, who is instantly attracted to Alfred (&quot;Vor dem Schloß&quot; – &quot;In Front of the Castle&quot;). Von Krolock invites the two men into his domain and the two reluctantly accept his invitation.

===Act II===
Sarah is now at Count von Krolock&#x27;s castle, wandering the dark empty halls and considering what her relationship with the Count truly is. The Count appears to welcome her and manages to resist biting her, planning to save her for the ball the next night (&quot;Totale Finsternis&quot; – &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;). At the same time, Alfred is asleep with the Professor in a guest bedroom in another part of the castle, suffering from terrifying nightmares, with one nightmare in which he loses Sarah to the bloodthirsty vampires (&quot;Carpe Noctem&quot; - &quot;Seize the Night&quot;).

The next morning, Alfred wants to find Sarah and flee the castle (&quot;Ein perfekter Tag&quot; / &quot;Für Sarah&quot; – &quot;A Perfect Day/For Sarah&quot;), but Professor Abronsius is more concerned with staking Von Krolock and Herbert. Alfred and the Professor make their way to the crypt (&quot;In der Gruft&quot; – &quot;In the Crypt&quot;), where they locate the two vampires. The Professor becomes stuck on a banister as he attempts to get into the crypt and assigns Alfred to kill von Krolock and his son, but Alfred can&#x27;t bring himself to drive a stake through their hearts. Before the Professor can think of something else, he hears a noise and the hapless duo flee the crypt just as Chagal arrives with Magda&#x27;s coffin. Magda climbs out, now a vampire, and finally concedes to having a sexual relationship with Chagal.

Alfred and the Professor continue searching the castle and separate in the library (&quot;Bücher, Bücher&quot; – &quot;Books, Books&quot;). Alfred comes across a small bedroom where he finds Sarah in the bathroom, apparently unharmed. Alfred begs for her to leave, but Sarah refuses, saying she wants to stay for the midnight ball. She coaxes Alfred to leave the room (involving another encounter in the library, &quot;Noch mehr Bücher&quot; – &quot;Even More Books&quot;) while she gets dressed, but when Alfred returns, Sarah is gone, and Herbert is in her place. Herbert tries flirting with the confused and terrified &quot;hero&quot; (&quot;Wenn Liebe in dir Ist&quot; – &quot;When Love is Inside You&quot;), which culminates with him lunging at Alfred&#x27;s neck, but the Professor comes in the nick of time and hits the young vampire with an umbrella.

As Alfred and the Professor make it outside, the sun sets and they are confronted by von Krolock, who mocks the Professor&#x27;s naive attempt to destroy him (&quot;Sie irren, Professor&quot; – &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong, Professor&quot;). To their horror, the two watch a whole mob of vampires rise up from a nearby church yard and head towards the ballroom (&quot;Ewigkeit&quot; – &quot;Eternity&quot;). As the vampires leave their resting places, von Krolock reflects on his painful damnation as a member of the undead (&quot;Die unstillbare Gier&quot; – &quot;The Insatiable Greed&quot;), which Alfred overhears, but the Professor dismisses von Krolock as nothing more than a monster.

The vampires arrive in the castle and the ball begins (&quot;Tanzsaal&quot; – &quot;The Dance Hall&quot;). Alfred and Professor Abronisus sneak their way inside dressed as members of the undead. Count von Krolock appears at the top of the stairs to introduce his &quot;guest,&quot; whom he forbids the other vampires to touch. Sarah enters the ballroom in an elegant red ballgown and approaches von Krolock. He is quick to embrace her with a bite, draining her blood. The Count then proceeds to dance with the weakened Sarah as the other vampires join them in a menuet. Alfred and the Professor plan to sneak Sarah out during the dance, but unfortunately for them, a mirror is unveiled, blowing their cover since they&#x27;re the only ones reflected. Von Krolock commands his vampire flock to attack Alfred and his mentor, but the former manages to form a makeshift cross out of two candelabras, causing a diversion. The three humans make their escape as von Krolock, furious, sends Koukol chasing after the girl.

Koukol chases Alfred, Sarah and the Professor through the woods, but is attacked by wolves and killed. The three heroes stop on a small hillside to rest. Alfred once more professes his love to Sarah and the two lovers embrace (&quot;Draußen ist Freiheit – Reprise&quot; – &quot;Outside is Freedom (Reprise)&quot;). However, Sarah is already turned and bites Alfred mid-song, turning him into a vampire as well and both of them flee into the woods. Professor Abronsius, too consumed by his note-taking, does not see what is happening behind him until it is too late. In the epilogue, all vampires rejoice in their eternal dance (&quot;Der Tanz der Vampire&quot; – &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;).

===Germany casts===
===United States===

====Pre-opening====
From the premiere of , English producers were seeking to bring the show to English-speaking countries. Composer Steinman was no stranger to the theater scene in New York, having spent five years under the professional wing of New York Shakespeare Festival founder Joseph Papp in the early seventies and authored several musicals, including &quot;The Dream Engine&quot;, &quot;Neverland&quot; and &quot;The Confidence Man&quot;, and also provided the lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;. After briefly considering a West End run, under the influence of Steinman and his manager David Sonenberg, it was decided to bring the musical (now titled &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;) to New York for the 1998 season, with Steinman translating and reshaping the German book and lyrics, Polanski returning as director, and original Viennese producer/Polanski manager Andrew Braunsberg serving as executive producer. Efforts to return Polanski to the United States proved fruitless, leading first to postponing the show&#x27;s opening to Halloween 2000, and then to the decision (dated to roughly March 2000) to seek a different director if Polanski could not return.

In October 2000, a tentative fall 2001 opening was announced, along with the declaration that Steinman himself would serve as the show&#x27;s director, despite never having directed for the stage. Attempting to reassure doubters, Steinman asserted in interviews that &quot;Half the show [in Vienna] I had to talk Polanski into doing, and did it behind his back a lot. He&#x27;s a great guy but he had a totally different vision&quot;. As early 2001 approached, however, and a reading for potential producers and investors was announced in the news section of Steinman&#x27;s fan website, things began taking on a more concrete shape. John Caird was to co-direct, and comedic playwright David Ives was helping to reconfigure the book with a view toward a more comic angle instead of a straightforward adaptation of the successful Austrian version, which was deemed to be written in a style no longer accepted by Broadway critics and audiences. As Steinman later put it, looking back with a more jaundiced eye, &quot;We were told to put five jokes on every page&quot;. Signing on as producers were Sonenberg and the producing team of Elizabeth Williams and Anita Waxman, then known for the critically acclaimed revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

The new version, described by Steinman to the press as &quot;a big, Wagnerian musical with lots of humor [...] a lot of it is pure Mel Brooks and a lot of it Anne Rice&quot; and to the by-invitation-only audience as a musical for &quot;people who think musicals suck,&quot; was met with a mixed reception. Potential investors and producers seemed to love the score, but felt the new book with its mix of bawdy humor and eroticism needed fine-tuning. Unfortunately, Steinman&#x27;s creative disagreements with his producing team (at one point telling the press &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you how many things are the opposite of what I want, but I am part of a team&quot;), and their seeming inability to raise the investment money in time for a now-rather-unrealistic fall opening, led to tense situations backstage. Finally, Waxman and Williams were ousted from the production, with Sonenberg assuming day-to-day responsibilities as the lead producer, a strategic move viewed by many as a power grab on Steinman&#x27;s part (as one source put it, &quot;he has the final say on everything&quot;).

====Casting Crawford, 9/11, and other disasters====
At this point, the show needed some kind of drawing card to attract investors scared off by the previous snafus on the producing front. It was decided that a star lead in the role of Count von Krolock would be just the trick; feelers were put out to names as diverse as David Bowie, John Travolta, Richard Gere and Plácido Domingo. Ultimately, the team came to an agreement with Michael Crawford, best known on Broadway at the time as the title character in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in the 1980s. Steinman was reportedly elated, calling him &quot;a towering talent&quot; and &quot;probably the biggest box-office star in the theater.&quot; However, Crawford wanted some assurances before he would take on a planned three years in the role. He demanded complete creative control of his character, he wanted a &quot;retirement package&quot; of up to £20m a year ($180,000 a week in American money), and he also preferred to have &quot;first refusal&quot; on (i.e., the option to reprise) the role in London and Los Angeles. Additionally, though not a major point in negotiations, Crawford also sought assurance that he would receive the role of von Krolock in any resulting film version, having recently lost the film role of the Phantom to initial star Antonio Banderas (later replaced by Gerard Butler). Of the four points of negotiation, Crawford won two, creative control and first refusal, eschewing the original salary (after initial press reports caused an outcry over his massive payday) for a much slimmer $30,000 a week. While Steinman, still ebullient over Crawford&#x27;s casting, defended the original figure by saying Crawford &quot;would be worth every cent we can pay him&quot;, a more sensible Crawford claimed that initial reports of a $180,000 salary were &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;a piece of fantasy journalism from my home country,&quot; adding that &quot;anyone who knows how many people you can fit in a theater knows that you don&#x27;t do Broadway to make money&quot;. The possibility of the film role, meanwhile, was never mentioned again.

By the time an official deal with Crawford was announced, by now downgraded to a yearlong contract in the role rather than three, he had been pulling his weight in the creative control department; as Sonenberg put it, &quot;[He has been] working with us the last several months on input on the book.&quot; Crawford&#x27;s agent Mort Viner reported that the role would not be a repeat of his &quot;Phantom&quot; performance &quot;because of the comedy.&quot; Indeed, Crawford was involved in reshaping the role of von Krolock in a more comic fashion, insisting that the role as written was too close to the Phantom. Later reports would claim that Crawford, paranoid about doing anything that could be compared to the Phantom, agreed with the party line that the piece should be a comedy on the lines of Mel Brooks and that he personally revised and rearranged the book to that end, causing co-librettist Ives to remark that he was a stenographer rather than a writer, but in reality, the show already exhibited signs of much larger changes of a similar fashion as far back as the workshop production in mid-May 2001 before Crawford&#x27;s casting; it seems that Crawford&#x27;s major contributions at this time were in the vein of a &quot;Continental accent&quot; (a mix of Italian and Cockney tones that Crawford claimed made singing the score easier) and input on costume designs aimed at hiding alleged weight problems (jowls in particular). After rehearsals were to begin in January, the opening was set for April 2002 following six weeks of previews starting in March, while further casting sessions for secondary leads and ensemble were set for September 2001.

As a consequence of the September 11 attacks, however, the game-plan changed significantly. With most of the show&#x27;s major creative team (including co-director Caird) based in London, a myriad of logistic delays were caused by mass cancellation of flights, among other variables. Realizing there was no way to open before the Tony cut-off as planned, and (it later emerged) unable to raise his share of the investment on time, Sonenberg publicly announced the postponement of the show&#x27;s opening to October 24.

====Previews to opening====
Having postponed the show, the team sought to bring in additional producers who could help get the show in on time. Finally, USA Ostar Theatricals (headed by Barry Diller and Bill Haber), of the revival of &quot;Noises Off&quot;, Bob Boyett (producer of a revival of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and investor in a revival of &quot;The Crucible&quot; and original productions &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; and &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;), and Lawrence Horowitz (producer of &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But the Blues&quot;) signed on. A creative team was also finally being assembled, including set designer David Gallo, whom Steinman liked because Gallo told him upon meeting for the first time that he was probably the only set designer in America who still subscribed to Heavy Metal Magazine, and that he bought &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; because he saw the album cover artwork (conceived by Steinman and executed by Richard Corben) and decided he had to have it before he even heard the music. On the flip side, due to delays caused by Caird&#x27;s long-distance habitation, and a desire on the part of the new producers to see names experienced with quirky comedies at the helm, Steinman found himself and Caird replaced as directors by John Rando of &quot;Urinetown&quot; fame, who was quickly joined by choreographer John Carrafa, his co-helmer on &quot;Urinetown&quot;.

A cast also rapidly shaped up around Crawford with the input of the new director and choreographer in a fresh set of auditions, with then-ingenues Mandy Gonzalez and Max von Essen in the young lead roles of Sarah and Alfred, René Auberjonois (after similar prolonged negotiations to Crawford&#x27;s) as Professor Abronsius, Ron Orbach (late of the out-of-town run of &quot;The Producers&quot;) as Chagal, and Leah Hocking as Magda, among others.

On paper, put together by talented people, &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; looked like magic. A celebrated rock composer, a critics&#x27; darling who had authored several Off-Broadway plays, a Tony Award-winning director, and a high-wattage Broadway star were the captains of this ship. However, rehearsals proved just how unsteady the ship actually was.

Rando had never directed a musical of this size, and quickly proved overwhelmed according to cast members. Choreographer Carrafa wasn&#x27;t helping; his idea of staging a big dance number was to tell the performers, &quot;Just rock on!&quot; Company morale was no better, as cast members began poking fun at Crawford&#x27;s weight-sensitive costumes behind his back, calling him a &quot;fat rooster.&quot; Crawford himself was no angel either; co-author Michael Kunze attested after the fact that Crawford &quot;reject[ed] any well-meant suggestions for change by saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t wanna talk about it anymore.&#x27;&quot; Kunze, the original author of the German work, had much to complain about when it came to changes, but most of all that there was no &quot;final moment&quot; where one concept for the production was crystallized, partly because the director didn&#x27;t seem &quot;able to decide what was good or bad about both Jim Steinman&#x27;s and Michael Crawford&#x27;s ideas.&quot; Adding to the lack of a definitive creative head was the director&#x27;s unplanned absence, due to his mother&#x27;s death, which sidelined Rando from the production during several weeks of previews. Steinman proved to have a bad attitude about the process; although publicly he put on a brave face for the press preview and for most interviews, he later claimed that he could see what was wrong with the show, which he dubbed &quot;a runaway train&quot;: &quot;We ended up with two shows at war with each other. One was sensual and Gothic, the other was camp &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;. I knew the critics would kill us for that. We were the perfect target, a fat lady with a sign on her back that said, &#x27;Kick me!&#x27;&quot; However, unable to express his opinions without fighting with Crawford or the rest of the team (to the point that sharp- and quick-witted Steinman was viewed as verbally abusive by certain cast members), he opted instead to stop coming to the theater regularly, according to his account. It later emerged that in truth, presumably for his inactivity, Steinman was fired from the show by his own manager, acting as producer. Similarly, citing Sonenberg&#x27;s inability to come up with his share of the investment, Steinman managed to get Sonenberg thrown overboard as a producer; the two did not speak for some time after the mutual firing. At about the same time, several cast members left the show before opening.

The show finally started previews after technological and creative delays at the Minskoff Theatre on October 18, 2002. Initially, the seemingly final result was an altered version with campy humor that differed considerably from the original show. Although the show initially went well in sales based on Crawford&#x27;s name (for a time, the show played to packed houses in previews, and was in fourth place in terms of high-selling Broadway grosses without even having officially opened), the humor received some laughter and much criticism.

An attempt was made at arriving at a comfortable middle between the &quot;two shows at war with each other,&quot; and original author Kunze was finally consulted for his opinion of what should be changed (far too late, in his view). Ultimately, thanks ironically to the German author of the original piece, the show arrived at much of its final form: during previews, 30% of the dialogue was cut to allow room to expand the score and arrive closer to the original almost sung-through concept; the vampire costumes were redesigned to look less freakish; a new staging of the shock ending set in modern times suggested by Kunze was inputted. Other suggestions, such as cutting a new dramatic death scene for the Count and restoring some of the original German lyrics, met with more dissension, and Kunze withdrew those suggestions, not wishing to cause any trouble. On a lighter note, entertainment mogul Howard Stringer, a friend of Crawford&#x27;s, rang the final death knell for the weight-hiding costumes by telling Crawford he looked silly; from that point forward, the ruffled collars were gone.

Those major changes aside, the show seen in previews was still in flux, and a show that changed huge amounts of its material nightly, which caused some trouble with the cast. Crawford was regularly changing his dialogue and inserting his own jokes, testing the strength of the material, to the point that co-star René Auberjonois became paranoid about all of his jokes being cut, and the two began trying to step on each other&#x27;s punchlines. By the time of opening, however, this mutual tomfoolery seemed to have been reined in; producer Bob Boyett had no complaints about Crawford&#x27;s behavior, calling him &quot;a great star and a total professional&quot; and saying that he &quot;didn&#x27;t find him to be difficult at all.&quot; Another unfortunate side-effect of the changing material was that with Steinman out of the picture, there was no one around to write new lyrical material as necessary in some cases, and so the English version (of necessity) borrowed a lot of new material from Steinman&#x27;s lyrics for the previous English versions of what songs were recycled in the show (see song list below).

====Opening====
After a prolonged period of development (61 previews in total, with two of the originally set opening dates missed), the English version of &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; opened on Broadway on December 9, 2002. Music and lyrics for the English version were officially credited to Jim Steinman, and the English book was officially credited to Jim Steinman, Michael Kunze and David Ives. This version of the show was critically lambasted; the work of lead performer Michael Crawford was reviewed particularly harshly. When the reviews came out, Steinman made a show of his disapproval of the project by not attending the opening night and publicly distancing himself from the show that had resulted from this &quot;too many cooks&quot; approach: &quot;The show that I wrote is not at the Minskoff. The show that is dear to me is still running in Vienna. The one at the Minskoff was just a job.&quot; In later days, on his blog, he would still deny responsibility for what had occurred, writing that &quot;DOTV as we know was UTTER SHIT!&quot; in one post, and describing the production as a &quot;shit pile&quot; in another. He stated in other blog entries that his music was &quot;wasted&quot; on the show, and was careful to make a clear distinction between the Broadway version (referred to as &quot;DOTV&quot;) and the successful European version (referred to as &quot;Tanz&quot;).

On January 25, 2003, after 56 performances, &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; closed. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was &quot;one of the costliest failures in Broadway history&quot;, losing roughly $12 million, easily eclipsing the infamous musical &quot;Carrie&quot;.

*&quot;Professor Abronsius&quot;, an absent-minded vampire hunter.
*&quot;Alfred&quot;, Abronsius&#x27; young and well-meaning assistant.
*&quot;Sarah&quot;, the innkeeper&#x27;s beautiful young daughter.
*&quot;Chagal&quot;, a Jewish innkeeper and Sarah&#x27;s over-protective father.

== Songs ==
The musical score written by Steinman leans heavily on material from his earlier projects, mainly from his less-known shows like &quot;The Dream Engine&quot; and &quot;The Confidence Man&quot; (co-written with Ray Errol Fox), although it also features music from his widely known records like &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; (remade as &quot;Totale Finsternis&quot;), the melody, but not the lyric, from a &quot;Bat Out of Hell II&quot; song called &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot; (remade as &quot;Die unstillbare Gier&quot;) and &quot;Original Sin&quot;, originally written for the &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; album of the same name and later sung by Meat Loaf in &quot;Welcome to the Neighborhood&quot; (parts of which were remade as &quot;Gott ist Tot&quot; and &quot;Einladung zum Ball&quot;). The song &quot;Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young&quot; from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was also used (remade as &quot;Der Tanz der Vampire&quot;).

Asked at one point to explain the reuse of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, Steinman explained, &quot;That was an accident almost. I&#x27;m surprised it stayed in. [For the original production] in Vienna, I had only a month and a half to write this whole show and we needed a big love duet... But with &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, I was trying to come up with a love song and I remembered I actually wrote that to be a vampire love song. Its original title was &quot;Vampires in Love&quot; because I was working on a musical of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, the other great vampire story. If anyone listens to the lyrics, they&#x27;re really like vampire lines. It&#x27;s all about the darkness, the power of darkness and love&#x27;s place in dark. And so I figured &#x27;Who&#x27;s ever going to know; it&#x27;s Vienna!&#x27; And then it was just hard to take it out.&quot;

Asked about the impact of previously heard songs, especially &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, on the show&#x27;s popularity in Europe, Steinman replied, &quot;Well, the reaction, at least in Europe, was great. They recognized it, but then it seems – if it&#x27;s done well – to take on a different personality.&quot;

=== Later European versions ===
While some song titles changed in later variations, aside from the addition of one number to replace &quot;Die roten Stiefel&quot;, the substance of the score is largely the same. (For example, the new title of &quot;Nie geseh&#x27;n&quot; merely reflects the first line of the song replacing its original title, not a new number being written. English translations of the new German phrases are provided as above, the exception being &quot;Wuscha Buscha&quot;, which is a nonsense phrase repeated in the peasant scenes in question.) The list below reflects changes made to all productions after the Stuttgart and Berlin runs. A few scenes have also been revised with shorter songs and less underscoring in order to pick up the pace of the show.
;Act One
* &quot;Ouverture&quot;
* &quot;He, Ho Professor&quot;

<doc id="1004822" wikidata="Q4117105" url="?curid=1004822" title="Kidnapping and murder of Kenneth Bigley">
<text>Kenneth John Bigley (22 April 1942 – 7 October 2004) was a British civil engineer who was kidnapped by Islamic extremists in the al-Mansour district of Baghdad, Iraq, on 16 September 2004, along with his colleagues, U.S. citizens Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong. Following the murders of Hensley and Armstrong by beheading over the course of three days, Bigley was killed in the same manner two weeks later, despite the attempted intervention of the Muslim Council of Britain and the indirect intervention of the British government. Videos of the killings were posted on websites and blogs.

== Capture ==
The three men were working for Gulf Supplies and Commercial Services, a Kuwaiti company working on reconstruction projects in Iraq. The men knew their home was being watched and realised they were in great danger when their Iraqi house guard informed them he was leaving due to threats by militias for protecting American and British workers. 
Bigley and the two Americans decided it was worth the risk and continued to live in the house until their abduction on 16 September.

On 18 September, the Tawhid and Jihad (&quot;Oneness of God and Jihad&quot;) Islamic extremist group, led by Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, released a video of the three men kneeling in front of a Tawhid and Jihad banner. The kidnappers said they would kill the men within 48 hours if their demands for the release of Iraqi women prisoners held by coalition forces were not met. Armstrong was killed on 20 September, when the deadline expired, and Hensley 24 hours later.

==Negotiations for release==
After Armstrong and Hensley were killed, the British government and media responded by turning Bigley&#x27;s fate into Britain&#x27;s major political issue during this period, leading to subsequent claims that the government had become a hostage to the situation. The British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and the Prime Minister Tony Blair personally contacted the Bigley family several times to assure them that everything possible was being done, short of direct negotiation with the kidnappers. It was also reported that a Special Air Service (SAS) team had been placed on standby in Iraq in the event that a rescue mission might become possible.

The British government issued a statement saying it held no Iraqi women prisoners, and that the only two women known to be in US custody were two so-called high-profile Iraqi scientists, British-educated Rihab Taha and US-educated Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash. Both women participated in Iraq&#x27;s biological-weapons programme, according to the United Nations weapons inspectorate. News reports had earlier suggested that other Iraqi women were indeed being held in US custody, but it is not known to what extent these reports were out-of-date by the time of Bigley&#x27;s kidnap. The Iraqi provisional government stated that Taha and Ammash could be released immediately, stressing that this was about to happen anyway, as no charges had been brought against the women.

===Second and third videos===
A second beheading video was released on 22 September by Bigley&#x27;s captors, this time showing Bigley pleading for his life and begging the British Prime Minister Tony Blair to save him. Clearly exhausted and highly emotional, Bigley spoke directly to Blair: &quot;I need you to help me now, Blair, because you are the only person on God&#x27;s earth who can help me.&quot; The video was posted on several websites, blogs and shown on Al Jazeera television.

Around this time it emerged that Bigley&#x27;s mother Lil (then 86 years old) had been born in Dublin and was therefore entitled to be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland; this meant Bigley himself was also an Irish citizen from birth. It was hoped this status would aid his release, as Ireland did not participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the Irish Government issued Bigley an Irish passport &quot;&quot;, which was shown on Al Jazeera television. The Irish Labour Party spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael D. Higgins, made an appeal on Al-Jazeera. Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams made two appeals, one on 30 September and a second on 7 October.

On 24 September, 50,000 leaflets prepared by the British Foreign Office, asking for information about Bigley&#x27;s whereabouts, were distributed in al-Mansour, the wealthy district of Baghdad Bigley had been living in. In his home town of Liverpool, Christian and Muslim religious and civic leaders held joint prayer sessions for his safe return. The Muslim Council of Britain condemned the kidnapping, saying it was contrary to the teachings of the Qur&#x27;an and sent a senior two-man delegation to Iraq on 26 September to negotiate on Bigley&#x27;s behalf.

Bigley&#x27;s family, particularly his brother Paul, was successful, with the help of the Irish government, in eliciting support for Bigley&#x27;s release from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, King Abdullah of Jordan, and Colonel Gaddafi of Libya, who made public statements. A third video was released on 29 September, showing Bigley chained inside a small chicken-wire cage, wearing an orange boiler suit apparently intended to be reminiscent of those worn by inmates at the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In the video, Bigley again begged for his life, saying, &quot;Tony Blair is lying. He doesn&#x27;t care about me. I&#x27;m just one person.&quot; On 1 October, another 100,000 leaflets asking for information about Bigley were distributed by the British consulate in Baghdad.

==Death==
Despite the efforts to save him, Bigley was beheaded on 7 October 2004. His death was first reported on Abu Dhabi television the following day. A multi-faith memorial service, attended by Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, was held for Bigley in Liverpool on 13 November 2004. His body has not been recovered, although an alleged al-Qaeda terrorist awaiting trial for the 2003 Istanbul bombings has claimed he is &quot;buried in a ditch at the entrance to Fallujah&quot;.

The kidnappers made a film apparently showing Bigley&#x27;s murder, and the tape was subsequently posted on Islamist websites and on one shock site. According to reporters who watched the film, Bigley was wearing an orange jumpsuit, and read out a statement, before one of the kidnappers stepped forward and cut off his head with a knife. The bloodied head was then placed on top of Bigley&#x27;s abdomen. News reports published after Bigley&#x27;s death suggested he had briefly managed to escape from the kidnappers with the help of two MI6 agents of Syrian and Iraqi origin, who paid two of his captors to help him. The captors attempted to drive Bigley, who was carrying a gun and was disguised, out of town, the reports said, but he was spotted and recaptured at an insurgent checkpoint. The two captors who were said to have helped him escape were purportedly executed shortly thereafter.

==Torture-chamber discovery==
The chicken-wire cage in which Bigley was filmed was found in November 2004 by US troops in a house in Fallujah during the Second Battle of Fallujah. The US military stated that, in 20 houses, it found paraphernalia associated with hostage-holding and torture, including shackles, blood-stained walls, and a torture chamber.

==&quot;The Spectator&quot; controversy==
Boris Johnson, the then editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, was criticised by Simon Heffer for an editorial published on 16 October 2004 following the death of Bigley in Iraq, in which it was claimed that the response to Bigley&#x27;s killing was fuelled by the fact he was from Liverpool, and went on to criticize the &quot;drunken&quot; fans at Hillsborough and called on them to accept responsibility for their &quot;role&quot; in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989:
The extreme reaction to Mr Bigley&#x27;s murder is fed by the fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune — its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union — and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool&#x27;s failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.

Johnson apologised at the time of the article, travelling to Liverpool to do so, and again following the publication of the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; however, Johnson&#x27;s apology was rejected by Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, whose son James, 18, died in the disaster:
What he has got to understand is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It&#x27;s too little, too late. It&#x27;s fine to apologise afterwards. They just don&#x27;t want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn&#x27;t mean a thing to me.

<text>The Isère ( , ; ; ) is a river in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of southeastern France. Its source, a glacier known as the &quot;Sources de l&#x27;Isère&quot;, lies in the Vanoise National Park in the Graian Alps of Savoie, near the ski resort in Val-d&#x27;Isère on the border with Italy. An important left-bank tributary of the Rhône, the Isère merges with it a few kilometers north of Valence.

Many riverside communes have incorporated the Isère&#x27;s name into their own, for example, Sainte-Hélène-sur-Isère and Romans-sur-Isère. The department of Isère is likewise named after the river.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Isère&quot; was first recorded under the form &quot;Isara&quot;, which means &quot;the impetuous one, the swift one.&quot; Not originally a Celtic word, it was very likely assimilated by the Celts in ancient times. This word is related to the Indo-European &quot;*isərós&quot;, meaning &quot;impetuous, quick, vigorous,&quot; which is similar to the Sanskrit &quot;isiráḥ&quot; इसिरः อิสิระ with the same definition. It was probably based on the reconstructed Indo-European root &quot;*eis(ə)&quot; (and not &quot;*is&quot;), which incidentally has not been found in the Celtic languages of the British Isles.

The word &quot;Isara&quot; figures in the etymology of many other river names, from ancient Gaul and its neighboring lands. Examples of this are the Ésera in Spain, the Isar in Germany, the small Franco-Belgian Yser, or even the ancient name of the Oise, &quot;Isara&quot; (the French adjective &quot;isarien&quot; still exists in the language and continues to describe anything related to the Oise). In non-Celtic countries, we find the &quot;Isarco&quot;, a river in Northern Italy, the &quot;Éisra&quot; and &quot;Istrà&quot; in Lithuania, &quot;Jizera&quot; in the Czech Republic and &quot;Usora&quot; in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

== Geography ==
The Isère&#x27;s course measures and runs through a wide variety of landscapes: from its source near the Italian border in the western Alps, it crosses the Pays de Savoie and the Tarentaise Valley, cuts between the Chartreuse and Belledonne mountain ranges, follows the Vercors Massif, passes through the Dauphiné province, and finally meets with the Rhône at the foot of the Vivarais.

=== Valleys ===

The upper valley of the Isère is called the Tarentaise, and its middle valley the Grésivaudan.

The lower valley constitutes a section of the (also called the &quot;Valentinois&quot;) and is characterized by the river&#x27;s deep, winding channel. Instead of widening its banks over time, the Isère has dug deeper into its bed, forming stepped fluvial terraces. The valley has clearly defined borders and is relatively narrow, not exceeding in breadth.

The repetition of alluvial deposition (during periods of Quaternary glaciation) and overdeepening (during interglacial periods), known as a fluvioglacial system, led to the formation of several stepped terraces in the lower Isère valley, like the one on which Saint-Marcel-lès-Valence is built. This occurred through the massive accumulation of alluvium from the Isère on top of a bed of Miocene molasse. Today, these terraces still define the geography of the Plain of Valence.

=== Confluence ===

The Isère initially merges with one of the Rhône&#x27;s diversion canals, built for navigational purposes, at Pont-de-l&#x27;Isère. At the southern tip of La Roche-de-Glun (a commune on an island formed by the canal), the Isère Dam drains part of the water back into the Rhône and permits the Isère to continue its course alone until it passes through the Bourg-lès-Valence Dam and reaches its final junction with the Rhône.

== Hydrology ==

The length of the Isère is , and its drainage basin covers .

The vertical profile of the river is made up of several zones:
* From its sources to Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise (except for those sources having a slope of around 25%), the average slope of the Isère is 5.1%, in a more or less confined valley (forests, gorges, and higher up, grasslands).
* As far as Moûtiers, the slope measures 1.18%.
* Before the river&#x27;s confluence with the Arly, its slope is only 0.53%.
* The slope decreases to 0.136% until Grenoble.
* Downstream from Grenoble, it measures 0.1%.

The flow of the Isère was observed over a period of 58 years (between 1956 and 2015) at Beaumont-Monteux in the Drôme department, situated near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Rhône. The discharge of the river at Beaumont-Monteux measured .

The Isère&#x27;s large seasonal fluctuations are typical of rivers fed in large part by snowmelt, with springtime flooding raising the average monthly discharge between and from April to July (peaking in May and June), and low water levels in autumn and winter, from August to February, with a minimum average monthly discharge of in September. Generally speaking, this makes the Isère a very plentiful watercourse throughout the year.

However, the can drop to during a five-year dry spell, which is very low.

On the other hand, severe flooding can result from rapid thaw or torrential autumn rain. In fact, and QIX 5 are and , respectively. QIX 10 is . QIX 20 reaches , while QIX 50 rises to , which is still moderate compared to other rivers in the south of France, like the Tarn.

The highest instantaneous discharge on record was on September 16, 1960, while the highest daily value was on October 7 of the same year.

The depth of runoff for the Isère&#x27;s drainage basin is annually, which is quite high above France&#x27;s average and clearly superior to that of the Rhône&#x27;s drainage basin ( in Valence for a surface area of ). The specific discharge is 27.9 liters per second per square kilometer of drainage basin.

<text>Alexandria in the Caucasus ( &quot;Alexándreia&quot;; medieval Kapisa, modern Bagram) was a colony of Alexander the Great. It was one of many colonies designated with the name &quot;Alexandria&quot;. He founded the colony at an important junction of communications in the southern foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains, in the country of the Paropamisadae.

In Classical times, the Hindu Kush mountains were also designated as the &quot;Caucasus&quot;, specifically as &quot;Caucasus Indicus&quot; (Ancient Greek: Καύκασος Ινδικός) in parallel to their Western equivalent, the Caucasus Mountains between Europe and Asia.

==Alexander the Great==

Alexander populated the city with 7,000 Macedonians, 3,000 mercenaries and thousands of natives (according to Curtius VII.3.23), or some 7,000 natives and 3,000 non-military camp followers and a number of Greek mercenaries (Diodorus, XVII.83.2), in March 329 BC. He had also built forts in what is now Bagram, Afghanistan, at the foot of the Hindu Kush, replacing forts erected in much the same place by Persia&#x27;s king Cyrus the Great c. 500 BC, Alexandria being in fact a refoundation of an Achaemenid settlement called Kapisa.

The deity of the city seems to have been Zeus, as suggested by coins of the Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides.

==Indo-Greek capital==
Alexandria of the Caucasus was one of the capitals of the Indo-Greek kings (180 BC – AD 10). For example, it was ruled by the king Hermaeus who is particularly associated with the city.

During the reign of Menander I the city was recorded as having a thriving Buddhist community, headed by Greek monks. The epic Sri Lankan poem &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot; mentions the Greek (Pali: &quot;Yona&quot;, lit: &quot;Ionian&quot;) Buddhist monk Mahadhammarakkhita (), who is said to have come from “Alasandra” (thought to be Alexandria of the Caucasus), with 30,000 monks for the foundation ceremony of the Maha Thupa at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka:

:From Alasanda the city of the Yonas came the thera (elder) Yona Mahadhammarakkhita with thirty thousand bhikkhus.

== Archaeology ==
Some archaeological evidence concerning Alexandria of the Caucasus was gathered by Charles Masson (1800–1853), providing insight into the history of that lost city. His findings include coins, rings, seals and other small objects. In the 1930s Roman Ghirshman, while conducting excavations near Bagram, found Egyptian and Syrian glassware, bronze statuettes, bowls, the Begram ivories and other objects including statues. This is an indication that Alexander&#x27;s conquests opened India to imports from the west.

Today the cities&#x27; remains feature a rectangular tell 500 by 200 metres in area and a nearby circular citadel about 3km northeast of Bagram Airforce base. The tell lies beside the main road north and has been slightly damaged due to shelling during Afghan War of the 21st century.

<doc id="1004854" wikidata="Q266240" url="?curid=1004854" title="Barbara Steele">
<text>Barbara Steele (born 29 December 1937) is an English actress and producer, known for starring in Italian gothic horror films of the 1960s. She has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of All Scream Queens&quot; and &quot;Britain&#x27;s first lady of horror&quot;. She played the dual role of Asa and Katia Vajda in Mario Bava&#x27;s landmark film &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1960), and starred in &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961), (1962), (1964), and &quot;Castle of Blood&quot; (1964).

Additionally, Steele had supporting roles in Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975), Joe Dante&#x27;s &quot;Piranha&quot; and Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (both 1978), and appeared on television in the 1991 TV series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. She won a Primetime Emmy Award for producing the American television miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988–89). Steele appeared in several films in the 2010s, including a lead role in &quot;The Butterfly Room&quot; (2012) and supporting role in Ryan Gosling&#x27;s &quot;Lost River&quot; (2014).

== Early life ==
Steele was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire. She studied art at the Chelsea Art School and in Paris at the Sorbonne. Before her film career, Steele acted on stage and also worked as a model.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
Steele was signed to a contract by the Rank Organisation. She appeared in several minor film roles during the late 1950s, including in the BAFTA-winning &quot;Sapphire&quot; (where she appeared opposite future &quot;Black Sunday&quot; co-star John Richardson) and &quot;Upstairs and Downstairs&quot;.

In 1960, her contract was sold to 20th Century Fox. She guest starred on an episode of the ABC series, &quot;Adventures in Paradise,&quot; and was cast as the female lead opposite Elvis Presley in the Western film &quot;Flaming Star&quot; (1960). However, after one week of principal photography, Steele left the production and was replaced by Barbara Eden. Author Adam Victor writes in &quot;The Elvis Encyclopaedia&quot; that she was fired because studio executives thought her British accent was too pronounced. However, Steele claimed she quit over a disagreement with director Don Siegel. Regardless, a March 1960 Screen Actors Guild strike led Steele to abandon her Fox contract.

=== Italians films and stardom ===
Steele travelled to Italy, with the hopes of working with director Federico Fellini. Soon after her arrival, she was cast in her breakout part, the dual roles of Asa and Katia Vajda in Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. There are two accounts describing how Steele came to be cast in the film: one suggests that Bava, while perusing through head shots of British actors under contract at Fox, selected Steele from these photos. Steele, however, recalled that Bava tracked her down after being captivated by photos of her in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine photoshoot. Bava later commented that Steele &quot;had the perfect face for my films&quot;.

The success of &quot;Black Sunday&quot; launched Steele to overnight stardom and defined her status as a scream queen. She would star in a string of Italian horror films throughout the decade, including Riccardo Freda&#x27;s &quot;The Horrible Dr. Hichcock&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Ghost&quot; (1963); Antonio Margheriti&#x27;s &quot;The Long Hair of Death&quot; and &quot;Castle of Blood&quot; (both 1964), &quot;Terror-Creatures from the Grave&quot; and &quot;Nightmare Castle&quot; (both 1965).

She also starred in American director Roger Corman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961), based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story of the same title, &quot;The She Beast&quot; (1966) and the British film &quot;Curse of the Crimson Altar&quot; (1968). 

Steele guest starred in television shows including the spy drama, &quot;Danger Man&quot; (aka &quot;Secret Agent&quot;) starring Patrick McGoohan in 1965. In 1961, she appeared as Phyllis in the &quot;Beta Delta Gamma&quot; episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. She also had an supporting role in Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963), and in 1966 appeared in the second-season episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;.

=== Supporting parts and producer ===
Steele returned to the horror genre in the later 1970s, appearing in three horror films: David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Shivers&quot; (1975), Joe Dante&#x27;s &quot;Piranha&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Silent Scream&quot; (1979). She also played a lesbian prison warden in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s directorial debut, the women-in-prison film &quot;Caged Heat&quot; (1974). She had a supporting role in Louis Malle&#x27;s critically-acclaimed period drama &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978).

Steele served as associate producer of the TV miniseries, &quot;The Winds of War&quot; (1983), and was a producer for its sequel, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988), for which she shared the 1989 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special with executive producer Dan Curtis.

Steele was cast as Julia Hoffman in the 1991 remake of the 1960s ABC television series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. In 2010, she was a guest star in the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; audio drama, &quot;The Night Whispers&quot;.

In 2010, actor-writer Mark Gatiss interviewed Steele about her role in &quot;Black Sunday&quot; for his BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;. In 2012, Gatiss again interviewed Steele about her role in &quot;Shivers&quot; for his follow-up documentary, &quot;Horror Europa&quot;. In 2014, she appeared in Ryan Gosling&#x27;s directorial debut, the drama-fantasy thriller film &quot;Lost River&quot;, in which she portrayed the character Belladonna in a supporting role.

In 2017, she was inducted into the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame.

In 2020, she had a guest role on the animated series &quot;Castlevania&quot;, voicing the character Miranda.

== Personal life ==
Steele was married to American screenwriter James Poe. They were married in 1969 and divorced in 1978. Over the same period her focus changed from European (primarily Italian) films to North American ones. They have a son, Jonathan.

<text>Coaster (stylized in all caps) is a commuter rail service in the central and northern coastal regions of San Diego County, California, United States, operated by the North County Transit District (NCTD). 

The commuter rail line features eight stops, with a travel time of about one hour and one minute end-to-end. The service operates seven days a week except nights, with slightly greater frequency during weekday peak periods.

Coaster first entered service on February 27, 1995, and has since grown in ridership and capacity. In , the line had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
The North San Diego County Transit Development Board was created in 1975 to consolidate and improve transit in northern San Diego County. Planning began for a San Diego–Oceanside commuter rail line, then called Coast Express Rail, in 1982. Funding for right-of-way acquisition and construction costs came from TransNet, a 1987 measure that imposed a 0.5% sales tax on San Diego County residents for transportation projects. The Board established the San Diego Northern Railway Corporation (SDNR) – a nonprofit operating subsidiary – in 1994. SDNR purchased the of the Surf Line within San Diego County plus the Escondido Subdivision (later used for the SPRINTER) from the Santa Fe Railway that year.

Coaster service began on February 27, 1995. NCTD originally contracted Amtrak to provide personnel for Coaster trains. In July 2006, TransitAmerica Services took over the day-to-day operation of the commuter train, based on a five-year, $45 million contract with NCTD. In 2016, Bombardier Transportation replaced TransitAmerica as Coaster&#x27;s operator. In December 2018, NCTD achieved full implementation of positive train control along the entire Coaster route, making it one of only four railroads in the United States to achieve full implementation of this technology without needing an extension beyond 2018.

=== Future ===

San Diego County voters extended the &quot;TransNet&quot; sales tax through 2038, which includes funding for rail track upgrades. By the early 2010s, numerous improvements such as added double track and bridge replacements were in various stages of construction and design. As part of the broader North Coast Corridor project, approximately $1 billion is planned to be spent on new segments of double track between San Diego and Orange County.

Limited-use stations at the San Diego Convention Center and the Del Mar Racetrack for use during major events have been planned, and is expected to complete construction of the stations in late 2025. A northward extension to Camp Pendleton was also proposed in 2011.

In the early 2020s, officials recognized the need to move the tracks away from the encroaching erosion of the Del Mar bluffs. Planning and design of a rail tunnel under the city are ongoing, with an estimated completion date of 2035.

By 2024, SANDAG, narrowed down the del mar bluffs bypass to three routes. One of the routes tunnels under the Del Mar Fairgrounds, which is opposed by the local community

== Service ==
More than 20 Coaster trains run on weekdays, with additional service on the weekends. As of April 3, 2017, Coaster also added Friday Night service with trains running until a quarter after midnight. More weekend services operate during summer months and when there are special events, such as home games for the San Diego Padres. In March 2020, all weekend trains and some weekday trains were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic; however, weekend service was reinstated on May 29, 2021.

=== Stations ===

=== Fares and ticketing ===
The cost of Coaster tickets is based upon the number of zones traveled (see map). Fare collection is based on a proof-of-payment system: tickets must be purchased before boarding and are checked by roving fare inspectors. Monthly passes are available. All tickets and passes include transfer agreements with NCTD BREEZE buses and monthly passes include transfer with the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) buses and Trolleys. On January 20, 2011, NCTD implemented a fare reduction, which to increased ridership on Coaster and so was made permanent in September 2011. , regular one-way fares are as follows:

*Within one zone: $5
*Within two zones: $5.75
*Within three zones: $6.50

With proof of eligibility, senior citizens (ages 60 and over), people with disabilities, and Medicare cardholders receive a 50% discount on the above fares.

Riding Coaster without a valid ticket may result in a penalty fare of up to $250. Riders cannot purchase tickets on board the train.

==== Pronto Fare System / Former Compass System ====

Coaster, along with all other NCTD and MTS services, utilizes the new Pronto contactless fare system introduced in September 2021 by INIT Systems and SANDAG; the Pronto system succeeded the first-generation Compass Card system.&quot; As a replacement for the original &quot;Compass Card,&quot; the Pronto fare system allows for a tap-on, tap-off approach, so riders on Coaster can tap-on when entering the station platform (using one of the station&#x27;s validators), and tap-off when arriving at the destination stop, in order to deduct the correct fare. However, unlike other NCTD and MTS services, Pronto users for Coaster are required to purchase Day or Monthly Passes prior to riding due to different electronic ticket requirements. These passes along with general Pronto cards can be physically purchased at Pronto ticket vending machines at NCTD facilities, or in customer service centers; electronic versions can be purchased through the website or through the mobile applications.

Coaster previously utilized the aforementioned contactless &quot;Compass Card&quot;, made possible by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc. The &quot;Compass Card&quot; allowed passengers from MTS and NCTD to store regional transit passes and cash value on a rewritable RFID card. Customers would have purchased passes and added cash value on the Internet or at any ticket vending machine. Prior to boarding a train, customers tapped their Compass Cards on the ticket validator located on the train platform. The LED display on the validator would then light up with lights resembling that of a stoplight, and the LCD display showed text regarding the passenger&#x27;s fare account. The new Pronto system now used expanded upon many of the design concepts previously employed with the Compass Card system.

=== Ridership ===
Coaster carried about 514,450 passengers during its first year of operation, and ridership rose steadily in the years that followed. In 2019, Coaster ridership was approximately 1.4 million people, with an average number of 4,200 weekday boardings. The Coaster served riders in , and currently carries per weekday as of .

Approximately 40% of weekday commuters detrain at Sorrento Valley.

== Rolling stock ==

In June 2018, the North County Transit District (NCTD) Board approved the purchase of five Siemens SC-44 Charger locomotives to replace their existing five F40PHM-2C locomotives that were remanufactured by Morrison-Knudsen, with $10.5 million of the estimated $53.9 million cost earmarked from statewide gas tax and vehicle registration fees. In June 2019, the NCTD Board approved the purchase of two additional SC-44 locomotives to replace two EMD F59PHI locomotives; they are due for delivery in late 2022. In September 2020, the NCTD Board approved the purchase of two more SC-44 Chargers, for a total of nine; planned for delivery in April 2023, they will be used to expand service. Deliveries of the first five Siemens SC-44 Charger locomotives took place from August–October 2020; they began revenue service on February 8, 2021, the same day Coaster retired their five F40PHM-2C locomotives. Two locomotives were donated; 2103 to the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum, and 2105 to the Southern California Railway Museum.

In January 2020, Bombardier began to overhaul the legacy BiLevel equipment at a minimum rate of four cars per year; all 28 cars are planned to be overhauled and repainted into the new livery by 2026. The coach overhaul improvements include upgraded door systems, installation of LED light fixtures, seat cushion replacements, installation of electrical charging outlets, and suspension maintenance improvements.

In July 2020, the NCTD Board approved the purchase of eleven new Bombardier BiLevel passenger cars (consisting of eight coaches and three crash-energy management cab-cars) that will be used to add two trainsets to regular service and support SANDAG expansion upon delivery in late 2022. The base order also includes options for 27 additional cars, but such options have not currently been exercised.&lt;ref name=&quot;ut 7/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, NCTD announced that they were seeking public opinions and input on a re-brand of the agency, and ran online polls for the public to vote on a new livery for Coaster equipment. The new livery, chosen by Siemens in late 2019, is being applied to the overhauled coaches and to new equipment.

In June 2023, the NCTD board voted to sell five older bilevel cars to the Utah Transit Authority, and to sell two Charger locomotives (possibly to Caltrans or Metrolink). The funds will be used for operations or capital projects, including planned conversion to zero-emissions equipment.

=== Yards ===
NCTD maintains and utilizes two rail yards for Coaster. The main maintenance and storage yard, located at Stuart Mesa on Camp Pendleton, just north of the Oceanside Transit Center. This is where trains are serviced, maintained and stored for the night. From the service&#x27;s inception in 1995 until 2020, NCTD used Tracks 25, 26 and 27 of the MTS 12th and Imperial yard to store trains during midday.

<text>Weymouth Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Weymouth, Dorset, England. They compete in the National League South, the sixth level of the English football league system. Nicknamed the Terras due to their terracotta strip, they play their home matches at the Bob Lucas Stadium. The club is affiliated to the Dorset County Football Association and is an FA chartered Standard club.

==History==
===Early years (1890–1939)===

Weymouth Football Club was founded on the 26th of August 1890 and played their first fixture on the 24th of September v a Mr Popes XI at Lodmoor, winning 2–0. In 1896 they were one of the founding members of the Dorset League, finishing 3rd in its inaugural season. In the following 1897–98 season, they took a lease at the Recreation Ground, which would be their home for 89 years, and enjoyed success with their first Dorset League title. They continued as a continued member of the Dorset League over the next 20 years, winning a further league title in the 1913–14 season, shortly before the league was suspended due to the outbreak of the First World War.

Following the resumption of football, Weymouth were elected to join the Western League from the 1921–22 season, where they competed as well as continuing in the Dorset League. Following a Dorset League win that season, they followed it up in the 1922–23 season with a Western League, Dorset League and Dorset Senior Cup Treble. The following year the club turned professional, and were elected to the Southern League for the first time.

Weymouth Football Club were founded in 1890 and played their first game on 24 September. After winning the Dorset Junior Cup three times, they helped found the Dorset League. They first reached the national stages of the FA Cup in 1905–06 when they lost 12–1 to Gainsborough Trinity. Weymouth joined the Western League in 1907–08, embracing full-time professionalism following their 1923 win and joining the Southern League. However, by 1928–29, debts had mounted and the club withdrew, resuming as an amateur club. They climbed back up the table and reached the Premier League and then folded for five years and reformed.

===The Glory years (1939–1987)===
The Weymouth Recreation Ground was requisitioned in 1939 due to the Second World War—football only resumed in 1947 when the club reformed semi-professionally. In 1949 they lost 4–0 at Maine Road (as Old Trafford was being rebuilt) to Manchester United in the FA Cup third round, then in 1962 they reached the fourth round where they lost 2–0 at Deepdale to Preston North End. Soon achieving promotion back into the Southern League, they were champions in the 1964–65 and 1965–66 seasons. They share the distinction of playing all twenty seasons in the Premier Division prior to league re-organisation with Telford United and Yeovil Town. On 28 February 1967, Weymouth player Dick Keith, who had played in the 1958 World Cup for Northern Ireland, was killed in a building site accident. In the FA Trophy, Weymouth have reached the quarter-finals twice, doing so in 1973–74 and 1976–77.

===1987–2006===

On 21 October 1987, the club moved to the new Wessex Stadium with the opening match against Manchester United ending with Weymouth winning 1–0 following an unveiling by Ron Greenwood. After initial success, the club slumped following relegation from the Conference, and continued to see-saw between the Premier and Southern divisions of the Southern League. Ian Ridley took control of the club in 2003, bringing new optimism when he appointed former Weymouth and Leicester City player, Steve Claridge, manager.

Within a season, the club had gone from near-relegation to near-promotion and gate receipts had increased from 500 to 1,200. With Martyn Harrison&#x27;s arrival on the board, he decided to place the club under his company Hollybush Hotels and began to interfere in playing matters. This prompted Ridley to leave in September 2004, followed by Harrison sacking Claridge weeks later. Harrison had planned to appoint Steve Johnson—the brother of Gary Johnson—as manager in November, prompting a huge turnover in players. As the team dropped down the league, Harrison sacked Johnson in March 2005, with Garry Hill taking over. An automatic promotion to the Conference came with large loans from Harrison to meet increasing wage bills of around £20,000 a week and a full-time regime. In 2005, the team held Nottingham Forest to a 1–1 draw at the City Ground in the FA Cup, before losing 2–0 in the replay.

===Financial turmoil (2006–2012)===

In the 2006–07 FA Cup, Weymouth held Bury to a 2–2 draw at home, in front of BBC cameras, and that season the team finished 11th in the Conference. On 20 June 2007, Mel Bush was confirmed as the club&#x27;s new owner. John Hollins was confirmed as the club&#x27;s new manager after Tindall&#x27;s sacking, though the club finished 18th under him in the 2007–08 season. In 2008, the club started a rebranding programme, with the a new badge, and a club motto being introduced, &quot;&quot;Forward Together&quot;.&quot; The following month Hollins sacked and Alan Lewer was appointed as his replacement. Former chairman Ian Ridley, made a return to the chair on 18 March 2009. This was followed days later by the sacking of Alan Lewer. He was replaced by Bobby Gould, the former manager of Wales. Despite his experience, Gould was unable to turn the situation around and the club were relegated to the Conference South. On 20 May 2009, the club hired former Terras player, Matty Hale, as their new manager, though after a string of bad results he Hale in his resignation.

On 26 October 2009, Paul Cocks, a director at the club, announced that the club was in a critically poor financial situation. In November 2009, George Rolls became the new owner. Hutchinson was sacked on 7 January 2010. On 27 January 2010, Jerry Gill was named as the new manager, though he resigned after just 44 days in the job. A CVA proposed by George Rolls was accepted on 26 March, preventing the club from liquidating. A month later however, the club were relegated. On 14 April 2010, it was announced that Ian Hutchinson had returned as manager at the start of the 2010–11 season. In July 2010, chairman George Rolls elected to change the stadium name in honour of 85-year-old club president and former goalkeeper Bob Lucas, who was suffering from cancer. He died on 12 August. On 12 January 2011, with Weymouth bottom of the Southern League Premier Division, Rolls sacked Hutchinson. In January 2011 Martyn Rogers was hired to help the club avoid a third straight relegation, which was eventually successful.

===Trust ownership (2012–present)===
In February 2012, club director and lifelong fan Nigel Biddelcombe completed a takeover of the club from George Rolls, whose controversial reign at the Bob Lucas Stadium ended with his move to another club in deep financial turmoil, in Kettering Town. Biddlecombe and his board set up a trust which would mean no one person would ever be able to have total control of the club again. The shares Nigel, members of the board and most other shares bought over the years were officially transferred into the Trust before the Terras home game with Frome Town on Easter Monday. Weymouth finished 17th in the Southern League Premier Division in 2011–12. They had looked safe for much of the season but a downturn in form saw the Terras only secure safety on the penultimate day of the season with a 2–1 victory at home to Hitchin Town. That season the Terras also made it to the FA Trophy second round proper. After beating Chippenham Town 2–1 in round one, the Terras slumped to a 6–0 home defeat against Conference National side Alfreton Town. Following reorganization of the Southern League for the 2018–19 season, Weymouth finished the season in first place of the Southern League Premier Division South, to secure promotion to the National League South. The subsequent champions&#x27; play-off with Kettering Town ended in a 1–1 draw. Weymouth won the penalty shoot out 5–3, to be crowned overall Southern League Premier champions.

Weymouth finished the 2019–20 season in 3rd place and on 1 August 2020, they were promoted to the National League after a play-off final win against Dartford. The club were relegated back to the National League South in the 2021–22 season, relegation confirmed with four matches left after a 6–1 home thrashing by Wrexham. In the 2022–23 FA Cup, Weymouth drew 1–1 against League Two side AFC Wimbledon in the first round of the FA Cup at home, before losing 3–1 in the replay at Plough Lane.

==Rivalries==
Historically, Weymouth had their strongest rivalry with Yeovil Town, Often when the two clubs meet, a large police presence is required to separate the two sets of fans. In October 2021, fans reportedly clashed before and after the game in Huish, with mounted police and dog units being called into action. The 2020–21 National League season marked the first league encounters between the club and Weymouth since the 1988–89 Football Conference season. However, overall the rivalry has dwindled slightly over the past decade due to the lack of competitive meetings between the club and Yeovil Town. That was somewhat replaced by a growing rivalry with near neighbours Dorchester Town with the two teams facing each other regularly since the mid-1980&#x27;s. However Yeovil&#x27;s subsequent decline since 2014 has re-sparked the historic feud between the two clubs. Many Terras still fans consider Yeovil Town to be the clubs biggest rival.

<text>Fochabers (; ) is a village in the Parish of Bellie, in Moray, Scotland, east of the cathedral city of Elgin and located on the east bank of the River Spey. 1,728 people live in the village, which enjoys a rich musical and cultural history. The village is also home to Baxters, the family-run manufacturer of foodstuffs.

The present village owes its existence to the 4th Duke of Gordon (1743–1827). During the late eighteenth century, during the Scottish Enlightenment, it was fashionable for landowners to found new towns and villages; these can be recognised all over Scotland, because unlike their predecessors they all have straight, wide streets in mainly rectangular layouts, a central square, and the houses built with their main elevations parallel to the street.

Fochabers was founded in 1776, and is one of the best examples of a planned village. It is a conservation area, with most of the buildings in the High Street listed as being of historical or architectural interest, as is Bellie Kirk, the Roman Catholic church St. Mary&#x27;s Fochabers, which houses works by notable craftsmen, and the Episcopalian church, Gordon Chapel, which boasts the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite stained glass in Scotland.

Electricity was brought to the village in 1906 by the 7th Duke of Richmond, supplied from a small hydro-electric generating station built in 1905 in the Quarters district on the banks of the fast-flowing Spey. For a time in the mid-twentieth century, Fochabers was the home of three duchesses – Hilda, Duchess of Richmond and Gordon; Ivy, Duchess of Portland and Helen, Duchess of Northumberland. Between 1893 and 1966 the village had a railway station, Fochabers Town, although after 1931 this was open only to freight.

For nearly three decades, the people of Fochabers campaigned for a bypass, as the village is situated on the A96, the only direct route from Aberdeen to Inverness, and consequently suffered from serious traffic problems. Construction work on a bypass for Fochabers and the neighbouring village of Mosstodloch started on 2 February 2010 and was completed in January 2012, at a cost of £31,500,000. The project was significantly delayed due to conflict regarding the proposed route, and discovery of a Neolithic settlement on the site of the bypass.

==Education==

There are two schools in Fochabers, Milne&#x27;s Primary School (formerly Milne&#x27;s Institution) and Milne&#x27;s High School, which currently serves approximately 300 pupils from Fochabers itself and the surrounding villages and farms. Milne&#x27;s Institution was originally built in 1846, in accordance with Alexander Milne&#x27;s Last Will and Testament, using £20,000 (~£2,700,000 today) he left for this purpose.

As Poland declined to participate in the classification matches, they were awarded twelfth place: the other three teams played a round-robin set of matches.

An Italian traffic policeman on duty just outside the field blew his whistle. The Belgians thought it was the umpire&#x27;s whistle and stopped playing, whereupon the French scored the only goal of the game.

<text>The field hockey tournament at the 1948 Summer Olympics was the sixth edition of the field hockey event at the Summer Olympics.

In five Olympic hockey tournaments, there had only been two different winners, but Britain and India had never competed together at the Olympics. There was no question the UK would again be absent at their home Olympics, although there were some organizational difficulties. First of all, the four British nations were independently affiliated with the international federation FIH and were not very keen on cooperating. Also, there were no hockey grounds to train on, as these were used by cricketers during the summer. Still, they managed to put together a team, the first real British hockey team at the Olympics (the 1908 and 1920 champions had been composed entirely of English players). Their captain was the versatile Norman Borrett, a first-class cricketer and national squash champion who once qualified for Wimbledon but didn&#x27;t have time to compete.

The fixtures were announced on 19 June 1948. Revised fixtures were announced on 28 July. Britain and India were seeded, along with Pakistan and the Netherlands. Pakistan had only separated from India the previous year and made their first Olympic appearance in London. One of the team members, Ali Iqtidar Shah Dara, had been on the golden Indian team of 1936. All four ranked teams made the semis, although the Brits were held to a goalless draw by Switzerland, and Pakistan crushed the Dutch 6–1 in their group match. The semi-finals were close, and British observers considered the Indians to be lucky to get away with a 2–1 win against the Dutch. With Britain beating Pakistan, the gold medal match would finally see India play the Britons. Completely focused on its defense, Britain was unable to keep up with the fast-paced Indians, and they lost it 4–0. The bronze went to the Netherlands, beating Pakistan 4–2 in a replay of the first 3rd place match, which had ended in a draw.

If a player or an official accepts from club, association, or federation an amount exceeding what is strictly necessary for traveling and hotel expenses, such an amount will be regarded as profit.

Only a men&#x27;s competition occurred that year, and nine nations competed: Czechoslovakia withdrew before the draw.

==Medal summary==
Note: The players above the line played at least one game in this tournament, the players below the line were probably only squad members. Nevertheless, the International Olympic Committee medal database exclusively credits them all as medalists. If or why they could have received medals is uncertain. However the National Olympic Committee of the Netherlands does not even show the Dutch players as competitors.

<text>Army Men is a series of video games originally developed by The 3DO Company and then by Global Star Software. It is based on various conflicts between four kinds of plastic army men, distinguished by their color: the Green, the Tan, the Blue, and the Grey. Two other factions, the Red and the Orange, as well as a much smaller army, the Black, also contribute to the story. Two additional factions, the Galactic Army and the Alien Army, were introduced in &quot;Army Men: Toys in Space&quot;.

==History==
===Studio 3DO era===
The idea of a strategy game using plastic army men arose from the developers&#x27; desire to avoid censorship issues with the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle ratings board when publishing the game in Germany. Chris Wilson, producer of the original &quot;Army Men&quot;, explained:

&quot;Army Men&quot; used cutscenes done in the style of Movietone News clips.

===Global Star era===
&quot;Army Men: RTS&quot; was the final game in the series to be released by The 3DO Company. Their major franchises were auctioned off when the company filed for bankruptcy, and &quot;Army Men&quot; was purchased by Crave Entertainment.

In 2004, Global Star Software published &quot;Sarge&#x27;s War&quot;. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were completed by some members of the original &quot;Sarge&#x27;s War&quot; development team from 3DO. Global Star then released &quot;Army Men: Major Malfunction&quot; for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, and planned a Nintendo DS version, which was not released. Both &quot;Major Malfunction&quot; and &quot;Soldiers of Misfortune&quot; were unfavorably received by critics. &quot;Army Men: Mobile Ops&quot; was released for mobile phones in 2010. The series is currently owned by 2K after buying out Global Star in 2007.

=== Other games ===
A fan made &quot;Army Men III&quot; was under development by Neotl Empire, but was cancelled and resulted in an open source release of the unfinished game in April 2018. In December 2017, a licensed mobile game in the series was made by Volcano Force Studios under license from 2K Play under title &quot;Army Men: Strike&quot; that incorporates characters from the &quot;Sarge&#x27;s Heroes&quot; subseries.

==Reception==
During its later years, the &quot;Army Men&quot; series was criticized by &quot;X-Play&quot; and Seanbaby of &quot;EGM&quot;, for the frequency and declining quality of each new title. The &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; awarded six games in the series a score of 3/10 or less.

3DO released over 24 games within 10 years, leading to speculation that the company was rushing production, with little time and effort put into each title. Former creative director Michael Mendheim said in 2021 that after the success of the early &quot;Army Men&quot; games, the executives at 3DO pressured the team to ship a new game every quarter. 3DO co-founder and designer Trip Hawkins even wrote a letter to GamePro magazine to defend &quot;Portal Runner&#x27;s&quot; harsh reception, describing the editors as “angry young men” and threatening to reduce their advertising.

<text>Laguna is a Brazilian municipality located in the southern state of Santa Catarina, 120 kilometers south of the state&#x27;s capital, Florianópolis, and north east of Porto Alegre. The population is 46,122 (2020 est.) in an area of 336.4 km². Elevation is 2 m. The BR-101 coastal highway passes through the municipality.

The city was founded in 1676 by rural people of the &quot;capitania&quot; of São Vicente. In 1714, the locality was recognized as a municipality, and in 1847 it received the status of city. It was the capital of the short-lived Juliana Republic in 1839. The city&#x27;s flag is a tricolor with yellow, white and green, and has a coat of arms in the middle.

A pod of bottlenose dolphins resident in the sea off Laguna drive fish towards fishermen who stand at the beach in shallow waters. Then one dolphin rolls over, which the fishermen take as sign to throw out their nets. The dolphins feed on the escaping fish. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration has been going on at least since 1847. Southern right whales also can be seen from shores during winter to spring seasons.

<doc id="1004947" wikidata="Q209099" url="?curid=1004947" title="Digital camera back">
<text>A digital camera back is a device that attaches to the back of a camera in place of the traditional negative film holder and contains an electronic image sensor. This allows cameras that were designed to use film take digital photographs. These camera backs are generally expensive by consumer standards (US$5,000 and up) and are primarily built to be attached on medium- and large-format cameras used by professional photographers.

==Types==
Two sensor back types are commonly used: single shot back (non-scanning) and scan back.

Some backs, primarily older ones, require multiple exposures to capture an image; generally one each for red, green, and blue. These are called multi-shot or 3-shot backs. As technology advanced single-shot backs became more practical; by 2008 most backs manufactured were single-shot.

Early backs had to be used tethered by a cable to a controlling computer that would store the images they took. Newer models added the ability to store the photos inside the back itself, and added displays so that the picture could be viewed on the back without requiring a separate computer. Virtually all backs can still be operated in tethered fashion, which allows convenient previewing of images on a large monitor by several people at the same time, sophisticated control of camera functions, and convenient storage for the large image files produced.

Modern high resolution backs that push the limits of data storage and transfer technology still are able to make use of a tethered configuration to offload gigabytes of data to cheaper external storage mediums such as hard drives, instead of the more expensive integrated flash memory.

===Single shot back===

Non-scanning backs have a sensor similar to that used in most other digital cameras, a square or rectangular array of pixels. Backs are generally assumed to be non-scanning unless specified to be a scan back.

===Scan back===
Scanning backs operate more like an image scanner for paper: they have a linear array of sensors that is moved across the image area to scan the image one row of pixels at a time. Scanning backs are primarily used in large format view cameras.

==History==

The first commercial digital camera back was introduced by Leaf (now part of Phase One) in 1991. The Leaf DCBI (Digital Camera Back I), nicknamed &quot;The Brick&quot;, offered resolution of 4 megapixels (MP) in a 2048 × 2048 pixel format. The same CCD was used by Sinar in its equivalent sinarback. In 1994 Leaf introduced an improved model, the DCBII, which included a live-video view, and in 1998 they introduced the 6 MP Volare.

A complete camera system was constructed using the Sinar view camera system with a Sinarcam 1 shutter system which provided control of the live image, and an adapter plate was made to use the backs with Hasselblad cameras. Driver software generally required the use of an Apple Macintosh to operate the cameras.

These systems were complex and expensive. They used custom controller cards (known as the &quot;SCSI taxi&quot;), and were 3-shot backs; a colored filter wheel inside the back rotated to take red, green, and blue exposures.

=== Competition and evolution ===

Competition soon came to the new industry.

MegaVision in 1992 introduced their T2 back, which was a similar product; it also was a 3-shot unit with a 4 MP square sensor. MegaVision had been making digital photography equipment based on video technology since 1984, and the T2 had live video preview.

Phase One was founded in 1993, and by 1994 was selling their StudioKit scanning backs.
In 1998 Phase One launched the Lightphase. which was the first one-shot back that could compete with film in terms of quality.
Resolution was 6 MP and the physical size of the CCD was full-frame 35 mm, however the back was designed to be used on Hasselblad 500-series cameras.

Other early industry entrants included Jenoptik who produced products in cooperation with Sinar, Dicomed (a scanning back maker which closed in 1999), Better Light (the most prominent scanning back maker), and Kigamo.

By 2003, Leaf had an 11 MP model, the Valeo, and Jenoptik/Sinar had the 11 MP Sinarback 43. several vendors had 16 MP models; Kodak produced the US$15,000 16 MP Pro Back Plus using their own CCD, Imacon made the ixpress 96, Phase One had their H20 and Sinar continued its camera back development from the 22, 23h, 43h and issued the 44H which when mounted on a macroscan unit delivered an image of over 1 GB in size with live image focussing using the Sinarcam shutter system.

As of 2014 Phase One has a large market share with their own camera manufacturing and the IQ series digital backs that offer 80, 60.5 and 40MP resolution respectively. IQ180 and IQ160 both capture in full-frame 645 format.

=== Mergers and partnerships ===
During the first decade of the twenty-first century the digital back market began to change and consolidate quickly. One trend was the displacement of medium-format film cameras were by digital single-lens reflex cameras based on smaller, 35 mm film cameras, which can offer high-quality results with no more expense than medium-format film gear. At the same time digital workflow was increasingly easy. This is leading to the development of all-digital medium-format cameras which do not need separate digital backs.

Bronica and Contax, formerly two of the largest medium-format camera makers, went out of business. Fuji ceased production of their 680 medium-format film cameras. Mamiya crossed the product line divide in 2004, announcing a medium-format digital camera, the Mamiya ZD. The imaging technology used in this camera is also available as a separate digital back, the ZD Back, which can be used with Mamiya&#x27;s film cameras. Shortly after the product was announced, the company was sold. Pentax, for whose cameras digital backs are not available, sells a medium-format digital camera.

Another trend is the release of new camera systems designed to tightly integrate with digital backs; this provides users with the ability to use film, but is easier to use for digital work than a film camera with a less-integrated accessory digital back.

Under pressure from digital camera back manufacturers, long-established medium-format SLR manufacturer Hasselblad eventually merged with back maker Imacon under the Hasselblad name. The post-merger Hasselblad worked with Fuji to develop a new line of cameras (Hasselblad&#x27;s first in over 50 years) designed to closely integrate with digital backs, particularly the former Imacon models. This meant that Shriro (owner of Hasselblad/Imacon) and Fuji could squeeze out other back makers, sending those manufacturers (and the remaining medium-format manufacturers) seeking their own partnerships.

Mamiya announced a partnership with Phase One, which resulted in Phase One buying a major stake in Mamiya. Jenoptik commissioned Rollei to work with Sinar to develop their own tightly integrated platform, the Hy6. The Hy6 was also marketed by Leaf under their name and using their backs. The Sinar HY6 keeps the unique facilities of the rotating camera back and live image functionality.

During this process, several product lines of digital backs were discontinued. Kodak stopped making their own backs in 2004, shortly before purchasing Leaf. Fuji had their own line of backs, but certainly only one product line will be produced by Fuji and Hasselblad together leaving the Leica/Sinar group as the only European digital medium-format and view camera manufacturers.

Sinar is now a subsidiary of Leica and are continuing developments of high technology digitisation with more spectrally accurate systems and optional image size output from a fixed sized cameraback for increased speed

===Hardware evolution===
The early digital camera back market was dominated by scanning, rather than single-shot, models. Since it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear (one-dimensional) CCD array that has only a few thousand pixels than a two-dimensional CCD matrix that has millions, very high-resolution scanning CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, camera backs with a 7,000-pixel linear resolution—capable of scanning to relatively slowly produce pictures of about 40 MP—were available in the mid-1990s.

Many earlier multi-shot backs could natively capture only grayscale images; color images were created by scanning three times through red, green, and blue filters which rotated into place.

Early digital camera backs created more data than could be stored on the relatively small storage devices of the time that could be built into them, and had to be connected (tethered) to a computer during capture.

Later, one-shot digital backs, which can work at all shutter speeds even on motorized medium-format cameras, were produced. Images are stored on fast high-capacity plug-in memory cards, making tethering to a computer unnecessary so that the backs could be used wherever film can be used.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

While dedicated digital cameras suitable for advanced use are available, there are advantages in being able to use a film camera to take digital photographs. A single camera can be used for both film and digital photography. Cameras with features not available on digital cameras (e.g., view cameras) can be used to make digital images.

Digital backs which are used in place of the normal film back are available for most medium and all large-format cameras with adaptors which can allow the same digital camera back to be used with several different cameras, allowing a photographer to choose a body/lens combination best suited for each application rather than using a body/lens system which represents a compromise of design to fit a variety of applications.

Users with large investments in existing camera equipment can convert it to digital use, both saving money and allowing them to continue to use their preferred and familiar tools.

Exposures longer than several minutes are obscured by image noise when captured with a 35 mm digital SLR, but exposures of up to about an hour at room temperature and as long as 17 hours in extremely cold situations can remain noise-free on a digital camera back.
In practice a 30-second exposure on a Sinar 75 evolution with a built-in fan-assisted Peltier-cooled CCD represents the state of the art for practical purposes.

The resolution of digital camera backs (in 2017, up to 101 megapixels, IQ3 100) is higher than any fixed sensor digital camera (in 2017, up to 51 megapixels, Hasselblad X1D). and captures more detail per pixel due to the omission of an anti-aliasing filter. Each pixel is also able to capture more dynamic range due to higher quality electronics and larger pixel pitch. The use of active cooling systems such as internal fans and Peltier effect electric cooling systems also contributes to image quality. The Sinar eXact creates images in excess of 1 GB in multi-shot mode from a 49 MB sensor.

===Alternatives===
There are alternative ways to create a high-resolution digital image without a digital back.

==== Scanning film ====
If a high-resolution digital image is required, it can be achieved inexpensively without the use of a digital back by taking a large-format photograph on film and scanning the result; for best results a high-quality drum scanner is required. This can be used to create a much larger very high resolution computer file than is feasible with a single-shot digital back, and quality is high, though it has been argued that the resolution is not much better than a digitally photographed image.

A detailed comparison in 2006 by a professional photographer of drum-scanned 10 × 12.5 cm (4 × 5″) images and digital 39-megapixel images on a medium-format camera found resolution very similar, with the scanned images slightly better. Color accuracy was not compared as digital profiles for the digital back were not available, but the author was of the considered opinion that the digital camera would ultimately be more accurate. For sustained professional use the apparent cost advantage of scanning film was very much reduced on careful analysis; including expensive 10 × 12.5 cm (4 × 5″) film and processing and the cost of use of a drum scanner brought the projected cost over three years to about 80% of the cost of a digital back at the time. The digital back also had the advantage that the incremental cost of taking huge numbers of exposures was nil, while each 10 × 12.5 cm (4 × 5″) photograph cost over US$3. Both the scanned and the 39-megapixel images were noticeably better than images with a 22-megapixel back.

An actual flatbed image scanner can be used as a camera back if fast operation and short exposures are not required.

==== Stitching ====

Another alternative is to take multiple smaller pictures and then stitch them together via image stitching. In this way very high-resolution images can be produced from a low-resolution sensor. This can be done with a smaller digital camera, such as a DSLR, and stitching sliding back adapters are available for large-format cameras. The process can be lengthy, and is unsuited for moving subjects. There are also non-sliding options for stitching images together in various patterns using micro stepping of the image sensor and taking advantage of the gap between active pixel areas on the digital sensors. This stitching method is used to also give overlaid red green and blue pixel recording as well as increased resolution.

==Technical features==

===Typical backs===

By 2006 CCD matrix camera backs of 39 megapixels were available. using the Kodak CCD and 33-megapixel Dalsa CCD in the Sinar 75 and in the Leaf Aptus 75 (6726 × 5040 pixels, with 7.2-micrometre-wide pixels). By 2008 several camera manufactures were developing larger camera backs based on the Kodak 50-megapixel CCD. Scanning backs are a narrower niche, used only for the highest-quality images with large-format cameras. Sinar continued their development of the step and repeat system of extending the CCD capabilities (macroscanning) with the arTec camera which creates a panoramic image with stitching technology.

In addition to increased resolution, larger image sensors are becoming available; Kodak has produced a 50-megapixel CCD which is 49.1 × 36.85 mm (1.93 × 1.45″), approaching the size of a frame of 120 film (60 × 45 mm) and is twice the area of a 35 mm frame (36 × 24 mm), and over seventy times the area of the typical 1/1.8″ (7.2 × 5.3 mm) sensor size used in point-and-shoot pocket cameras. Large-area CCDs are used by the several manufacturers of high-resolution photographic equipment. Other recent innovations are built-in LCD viewing screens and the inclusion of all processing within the camera back, with output in open DNG file format, as in the Sinar 65.

The Pentacon Scan 7000 scanner camera was introduced at the photokina 2010 show in Cologne, Germany. Its resolution is 20,000 × 20,000 pixels (400 megapixels) in 48-bit color depth, and it is supplied with the SilverFast Archive Suite. One scanned exposure at this high image resolution might take 2 to 4 minutes.

<doc id="1004953" wikidata="Q55438" url="?curid=1004953" title="Mario Bava">
<text>Mario Bava (31 July 1914 – 27 April 1980) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director, cinematographer, special effects artist and screenwriter. His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, as well as the destructive capacity of human nature. Widely regarded as a pioneer of Italian genre cinema and one of the most influential auteurs of the horror film genre, he is popularly referred to as the &quot;Master of Italian Horror&quot; and the &quot;Master of the Macabre&quot;.

After providing special effects work and other assistance on such productions as &quot;I Vampiri&quot; (1957), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958) and &quot;Caltiki – The Immortal Monster&quot; (1959), Bava made his official feature directorial debut with the gothic horror film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, released in 1960. He went on to direct such films as &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;The Whip and the Body&quot; (all released in 1963), &quot;Blood and Black Lace&quot; (1964), &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot; (1965), &quot;Kill, Baby, Kill&quot; (1966), &quot;&quot; (1968), &quot;A Bay of Blood&quot; (1971), &quot;Baron Blood&quot; (1972), &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot; (1974) and &quot;Rabid Dogs&quot; (1974).

According to the British Film Institute, &quot;Bava took a vital role in the creation of the modern horror film. If there was to be a Mount Rushmore-style monument dedicated to four directors whose work pioneered a new form of big screen chills and thrills, those giant faces etched in granite on the mountainside would be: Bava, Alfred Hitchcock, Georges Franju and Michael Powell.&quot;

== Family ==
Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Mario Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy&#x27;s foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958) and its sequel &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot; (1959) (both were lampooned on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;). 

Mario Bava&#x27;s son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right.

== Biography ==

Mario Bava was born in Sanremo, Liguria on 31 July 1914. He was the son of Eugenio Bava (1886-1966), a sculptor who also worked as a special effects photographer and cameraman in the Italian silent movie industry. Mario Bava&#x27;s first ambition was to become a painter. Unable to turn out paintings at a profitable rate, he went into his father&#x27;s business, working as an assistant to other Italian cinematographers like Massimo Terzano. He also helped his father at the special effects department at Benito Mussolini&#x27;s film factory, the Istituto Luce.

Bava became a cinematographer himself in 1939, shooting two short films with Roberto Rossellini. He made his feature debut in the early 1940s. Bava&#x27;s camerawork was an instrumental factor in developing the screen personas of such stars of the period as Gina Lollobrigida, Steve Reeves and Aldo Fabrizi.

During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including &quot;I Vampiri&quot; (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), &quot;The Day the Sky Exploded&quot; (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), &quot;Caltiki – The Immortal Monster&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Giant of Marathon&quot; (1959).

Bava collaborates in &quot;I vampiri&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Commandment&quot;) for director Riccardo Freda in 1956, a movie now referred to as the first Italian horror film. Bava was originally hired as the cinematographer, but when Freda walked out on the project midway through production, Bava completed the film in several days, even creating the innovative special effects that were needed. He also handled the cinematography and special effects on the 1955 Kirk Douglas epic &quot;Ulysses&quot; and the 1957 Steve Reeves classic &quot;Hercules&quot;, two films credited with sparking the Italian sword and sandal genre.

Bava co-directed &quot;The Day the Sky Exploded&quot; in 1958, the first Italian science fiction film, predating even the sci-fi films of Antonio Margheriti. Because he had no earlier credited experience as a director, the film was credited solely to Paolo Heusch.
In 1960, Bava directed the gothic horror classic &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, his first solo directorial effort, which made a genre star out of Barbara Steele. His use of light and dark in black-and-white films is widely acclaimed along with his spectacular use of color in films such as &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Kill, Baby... Kill!&quot;, &quot;Blood and Black Lace&quot; and &quot;The Whip and the Body&quot;.

==Later works==
His work has proven to be very influential. Bava directed two films that are now regarded as the earliest entries in the Italian giallo genre: &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1963) and &quot;Blood and Black Lace&quot; (1964). His 1965 science fiction horror film &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot; was a thematic precursor to &quot;Alien&quot; (1979). Although comic books had served as the basis for countless serials and children&#x27;s films in Hollywood, Bava&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1968) brought an adult perspective to the genre; the movie was influenced by Pop artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Many elements of the 1966 film &quot;Kill, Baby... Kill!&quot;, regarded by Martin Scorsese as Bava&#x27;s masterpiece, also appear in the Asian strain of terror film known as J-horror. 1971&#x27;s &quot;A Bay of Blood&quot; is considered one of the early slasher films, and was explicitly imitated in &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;.

Bava was disappointed with the theatrical distribution of some of his later films. His &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot; (1972) never was selected by a distributor. Eventually, in order to get it released, the producer reedited the movie into an &quot;Exorcist&quot; clone, adding footage shot in 1975, and retitling it &quot;House of Exorcism&quot;. Bava&#x27;s &quot;Semaforo Rosso&quot; (1974) never was released theatrically during his lifetime, and in the late 1990s, it also would be reedited, with new footage added, and retitled; it was released on video as &quot;Rabid Dogs&quot;. It was released on DVD in 2007, slightly altered and again retitled, as &quot;Kidnapped&quot;.

In 1977, Bava directed his last horror film, &quot;Shock&quot;. His son, Lamberto Bava, was an uncredited co-director. The elder Bava later did special effects matte work on Dario Argento&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Inferno&quot;. Bava died suddenly of a heart attack on 27 April 1980, at age 65. His doctor had given him a physical just a few days before, and had pronounced him to be in perfect health. At the time of his death, Bava was about to start shooting a science fiction film titled &quot;Star Riders&quot;, on which Luigi Cozzi had hoped to collaborate.

== Filmography ==

==Influence and legacy==
Although most of Bava&#x27;s films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many eventually found acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava&#x27;s shy, self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood.

Mario Bava&#x27;s son Lamberto Bava worked for 14 years as Bava&#x27;s assistant director (beginning with &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot;), and became a horror film director. On several of Mario&#x27;s movies, Mario was credited as John M. Old. Later, Lamberto was sometimes credited as John M. Old, Jr. When Lamberto directed his first solo film &quot;Macabre&quot; in 1980 and screened the completed work for his father, Mario commented jokingly to Lamberto: &quot;I am very proud of you. Now I can die in peace&quot;. (He actually did die less than two months later.)

Several books have been published about Mario Bava: &quot;Mario Bava&quot; by Pascal Martinet (Edilig, 1984) and &quot;Mario Bava&quot; edited by Jean-Louis Leutrat (Éditions du Céfal, 1994) in French; &quot;Mario Bava&quot; by Alberto Pezzotta (Il Castoro Cinema, 1995) in Italian; &quot;The Haunted Worlds of Mario Bava&quot; by Troy Howarth (FAB Press, 2002) and most recently, the massive critical biography &quot;Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark&quot; by Tim Lucas (Video Watchdog, 2007; ).

A documentary about him titled &quot;Mario Bava: Maestro of the Macabre&quot; was released in 2000.

Mario Bava&#x27;s directing style heavily influenced many directors, including Joe Dante, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Francis Ford Coppola, John Landis, and Tim Burton. Bava and his works have also influenced Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright and Jennifer Kent.

The satirical TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; concluded their show in 1999 with &quot;Danger: Diabolik&quot;.

<doc id="1004956" wikidata="Q2026289" url="?curid=1004956" title="Operation Plumbbob">
<text>Operation Plumbbob was a series of nuclear tests that were conducted between May 28 and October 7, 1957, at the Nevada Test Site, following &quot;Project 57&quot;, and preceding &quot;Project 58/58A&quot;.

==Background==

The operation consisted of 29 explosions, of which only two did not produce any nuclear yield. Twenty-one laboratories and government agencies were involved. While most &quot;Operation Plumbbob&quot; tests contributed to the development of warheads for intercontinental and intermediate range missiles, they also tested air defense and anti-submarine warheads with smaller yields. They included 43 military effects tests on civil and military structures, radiation and bio-medical studies, and aircraft structural tests. &quot;Operation Plumbbob&quot; had the tallest tower tests to date in the U.S. nuclear testing program as well as high-altitude balloon tests. One nuclear test involved the largest troop maneuver ever associated with U.S. nuclear testing.

Approximately 18,000 members of the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines participated in exercises Desert Rock VII and VIII during Operation Plumbbob. The military was interested in knowing how the average foot-soldier would stand up, physically and psychologically, to the rigors of the tactical nuclear battlefield.

Almost 1,200 pigs were subjected to bio-medical experiments and blast-effects studies during Operation Plumbbob. On shot &quot;Priscilla&quot; (37 kt), 719 pigs were used in various experiments on Frenchman Flat. Some pigs were placed in elevated cages and provided with suits made of different materials, to test which materials provided best protection from the thermal radiation. As shown and reported in the PBS documentary &quot;Dark Circle&quot;, the pigs survived, but with third-degree burns to 80% of their bodies. Other pigs were placed in pens behind large sheets of glass at measured distances from the hypocenter to test the effects of flying debris on living targets.

Studies were conducted of radioactive contamination and fallout from a simulated accidental detonation of a weapon, and projects concerning earth motion, blast loading and neutron output were carried out.

Nuclear weapons safety experiments were conducted to study the possibility of a nuclear weapon detonation during an accident. On July 26, 1957, a safety experiment, &quot;Pascal-A&quot;, was detonated in an unstemmed hole at the Nevada Test Site, becoming the first underground shaft nuclear test. The knowledge gained provided data to prevent nuclear yields in case of accidental detonations—for example, in a plane crash.
The &quot;John&quot; shot on July 19, 1957, was the only test of the Air Force&#x27;s AIR-2A Genie rocket with a nuclear warhead. It was fired from an F-89J Scorpion fighter over Yucca Flats at the Nevada National Security Site. On the ground, the Air Force carried out a public relations event by having five Air Force officers and a motion picture photographer stand under ground zero of the blast, which took place at between altitude, with the idea of demonstrating the possibility of the use of the weapon over civilian populations without ill effects. The five officers were Colonel Sidney C. Bruce, later professor of Electrical Engineering at Colorado University, died in 2005; Lieutenant Colonel Frank P. Ball, died in 2003; Major John W. Hughes II, died in 1990; Major Norman B. Bodinger, died in 1997; Major Donald A. Luttrell, died in 2014. The videographer, Akira &quot;George&quot; Yoshitake, died in 2013.
The &quot;Rainier&quot; shot, conducted September 19, 1957, was the first fully contained underground nuclear test, meaning that no fission products were vented into the atmosphere. This test of 1.7 kt could be detected around the world by seismologists using ordinary seismic instruments. The &quot;Rainier&quot; test became the prototype for larger and more powerful underground tests.
Images from &quot;Upshot-Knothole Grable&quot; were accidentally relabeled as belonging to the &quot;Priscilla&quot; shot from &quot;Operation Plumbbob&quot; in 1957. As a consequence publications including official government documents have the photo mislabeled. The shots can be told apart by the trails of test rockets, which are prominently featured in images and footage of &quot;Grable&quot;, but appear almost completely absent at the actual &quot;Priscilla&quot; shot.

==Missing steel bore cap==

 In 1956, Robert Brownlee, from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, was asked to examine whether nuclear detonations could be conducted underground. The first subterranean test was the nuclear device known as Pascal A, which was lowered down a borehole. However, the detonated yield turned out to be 50,000 times greater than anticipated, creating a jet of fire that shot hundreds of meters into the sky. During the Pascal-B nuclear test of August 1957, a iron lid was welded over the borehole to contain the nuclear blast, despite Brownlee predicting that it would not work. When Pascal-B was detonated, the blast went straight up the test shaft, launching the cap into the atmosphere. The plate was never found. Scientists believe compression heating caused the cap to vaporize as it sped through the atmosphere. A high-speed camera, which took one frame per millisecond, was focused on the borehole because studying the velocity of the plate was deemed scientifically interesting. After the detonation, the plate appeared in only one frame. Regarding its speed Brownlee reckoned that &quot;a lower limit could be calculated by considering the time between frames (and I don&#x27;t remember what that was)&quot;, and joked that the best estimate was it was &quot;going !&quot;. Brownlee estimated that the explosion, combined with the specific design of the shaft, could accelerate the plate to approximately six times Earth&#x27;s escape velocity.

<text>Saint-Pierre-du-Mont () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==History==

===World War II===
During World War II, the area was heavily bombarded on several occasions during May and early June 1944 by Allied bombers, attacking German coastal fortifications of the Atlantic Wall just north of the commune along the coast.

Saint-Pierre-du-Mont was liberated by American Ranger forces on 7 June 1944 after moving inland from Pointe du Hoc. The area north of the commune was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a combat airfield, known as Advanced Landing Ground &quot;A-1&quot; (Saint-Pierre-du-Mont). The airfield was used between early June and September 1944. It was abandoned after the Americans moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies.

<doc id="1004958" wikidata="Q465534" url="?curid=1004958" title="Széchenyi Chain Bridge">
<text>The Széchenyi Chain Bridge ( ) is a chain bridge that spans the River Danube between Buda and Pest, the western and eastern sides of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849. It is anchored on the Pest side of the river to Széchenyi Square (formerly Roosevelt Square), adjacent to the Gresham Palace and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and on the Buda side to Adam Clark Square, near the Zero Kilometre Stone and the lower end of the Castle Hill Funicular, leading to Buda Castle.

The bridge bears the name of István Széchenyi, a major supporter of its construction, but is most commonly known as the &quot;Chain Bridge&quot;. At the time of its construction, it was regarded as a marvel of modern engineering. Its decorations are made of cast iron.

== History ==

The bridge was designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark in 1839, following an initiative by Count István Széchenyi, with construction supervised locally by Scottish engineer Adam Clark (no relation). It is a larger-scale version of Tierney Clark&#x27;s earlier Marlow Bridge, across the River Thames in Marlow, England, and was designed in sections and shipped from the United Kingdom to Hungary for final construction.

It was funded to a considerable extent by the Greek merchant Georgios Sinas who had financial and land interests in the city and whose name is inscribed on the base of the south-western foundation of the bridge on the Buda side.

The bridge opened in 1849, after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, becoming the first permanent bridge in the Hungarian capital. At the time, its centre span of was one of the largest in the world. The lions at each of the abutments were carved in stone by the sculptor and installed in 1852. The bronze lions of Trafalgar Square (commissioned in 1858 and installed in 1867) are similar in design to the Chain bridge lions. The bridge was given its current name in 1898.

The bridge&#x27;s cast-iron structure was updated and strengthened in 1914. In World War II, the bridge was blown up on 18 January 1945 by the retreating Germans during the Siege of Budapest, with only the towers remaining. It was rebuilt, and reopened in 1949.

The inscription on each side of the bridge is to &quot;Clark Adam&quot;, the bridge builder&#x27;s name in the local Eastern name order. A plaque on the Pest side of the river reads &quot;To commemorate the only two surviving bridges designed by William Tierney Clark: The Széchenyi Chain Bridge over the Danube at Budapest and the suspension bridge over the Thames at Marlow, England.&quot;

The bridge was closed for traffic between March 2021 and August 2023 for renovations;

==In popular culture==
In 2001 Hungarian stunt pilot Péter Besenyei flew upside down under the bridge, a manoeuvre that became a standard in Red Bull air races today.

The bridge is featured in the films &quot;Music Box&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Au Pair&quot;, &quot;Walking with the Enemy&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot;, and is the setting of the climax in the Bollywood blockbuster &quot;Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam&quot;. The bridge appears in the opening shots of the 2021 &quot;Black Widow&quot; trailer, and season two of Baptiste.

The bridge featured prominently in Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;Cremaster 5&quot;, serving as a reference to Harry Houdini, and also appears in Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;Origin&quot; and in Syfy channel&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; Season Two premiere episode in April 2016.

It also appears at the beginning of the video for Katy Perry&#x27;s song &quot;Firework&quot;, and K-pop vocal duo Davichi&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Cry Again&quot;.

According to a Hungarian legend, the lions of Széchenyi Chain Bridge have no tongues. This legend is not true, the tongues are just not visible.

The bridge has been depicted on the Hungarian 200 Forint coin since 2012.

<text>A superior mouth is a mouth that opens upward, with the lower jaw more anterior than the upper jaw. This is an effect typically seen in fish. This usually means that the fish feeds from the surface of the body of water in which it dwells. A superior mouth is associated with fish in more stationary waters, such as those in lake ecosystems.

<text>The Soul of a New Machine is a nonfiction book written by Tracy Kidder and published in 1981. It chronicles the experiences of a computer engineering team racing to design a next-generation computer at a blistering pace under tremendous pressure. The machine was launched in 1980 as the Data General Eclipse MV/8000.

The book, whose author was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as having &quot;elevated it to a high level of narrative art&quot; is &quot;about real people working on a real computer for a real company,&quot; and it won the 1982 National Book Award for Nonfiction and a Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.

==Plot==
The book opens with a turf war between two computer design groups within Data General Corporation, a minicomputer vendor in the 1970s. Most of the senior designers are assigned the &quot;sexy&quot; job of designing the next-generation machine in North Carolina. Their project, code-named &quot;Fountainhead&quot;, is to give Data General a machine to compete with the VAX computer from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which is starting to take over the new 32-bit minicomputer market. Meanwhile, at the corporate headquarters at Westborough, Massachusetts, the few remaining senior designers there are assigned the much more humble job of improving Data General&#x27;s existing products. Tom West, the leader of the Westborough designers, starts a skunkworks project. Code-named &quot;Eagle&quot;, it becomes a backup plan in case Fountainhead fails, and then the company&#x27;s only hope in catching up with DEC. In order to complete the project on time, West takes risks: he elects to use new technology, and he relies on new college graduates (who have never designed anything so complex) as the bulk of his design team. The book follows many of the designers as they give almost every waking moment of their lives to design and debug the new machine.

==Themes==
The work environment described in the book is in many ways opposite of traditional management. Instead of top-down management, many of the innovations are started at the grassroots level. Instead of management having to coerce labor to work harder, labor volunteers to complete the project on time. The reason for this is that people will give their best when the work itself is challenging and rewarding. Many of the engineers state that &quot;they don&#x27;t work for the money&quot;, meaning they work for the challenge of inventing and creating. The motivational system is akin to the game of pinball, the analogy being that if you win this round, you get to play the game again; that is, build the next generation of computers.

A running theme in the book is the tension between engineering quality and time to market: the engineers, challenged to bring a minicomputer to market on a very short time-frame, are encouraged to cut corners on design. Tom West describes his motto as &quot;Not everything worth doing is worth doing well,&quot; or &quot;If you can do a quick-and-dirty job and it works, do it.&quot;

The engineers, in turn, complain that the team&#x27;s goal is to &quot;put a bag on the side of the Eclipse&quot; – in other words, to turn out an inferior product in order to have it completed more quickly.

Tom West practices the &quot;Mushroom Theory of Management&quot; – &quot;keeping them in the dark, feeding them shit, and watch them grow.&quot; That is, isolating the design team from outside influences and, instead, using the fear of the unknown to motivate the team.

The &quot;Soul&quot; of the new machine comes from the dedicated engineers who bring it to life with their endless hours of attention and toil. The soul is theirs, stored in silicon and microcode.

<doc id="1004971" wikidata="Q1256244" url="?curid=1004971" title="Photonic-crystal fiber">
<text>Photonic-crystal fiber (PCF) is a class of optical fiber based on the properties of photonic crystals. It was first explored in 1996 at University of Bath, UK. Because of its ability to confine light in hollow cores or with confinement characteristics not possible in conventional optical fiber, PCF is now finding applications in fiber-optic communications, fiber lasers, nonlinear devices, high-power transmission, highly sensitive gas sensors, and other areas. More specific categories of PCF include photonic-bandgap fiber (PCFs that confine light by band gap effects), holey fiber (PCFs using air holes in their cross-sections), &quot;hole-assisted&quot; fiber (PCFs guiding light by a conventional higher-index core modified by the presence of air holes), and Bragg fiber (photonic-bandgap fiber formed by concentric rings of multilayer film). Photonic crystal fibers may be considered a subgroup of a more general class of microstructured optical fibers, where light is guided by structural modifications, and not only by refractive index differences. Hollow-core fibers (HCFs) are a related type of optical fiber which bears some resemblance to holey optical fiber, but may or may not be photonic depending on the fiber.

== Description ==
Optical fibers have evolved into many forms since the practical breakthroughs that saw their wider introduction in the 1970s as conventional step index fibers and later as single material fibers where propagation was defined by an effective air cladding structure.

In general, regular structured fibers such as photonic crystal fibers, have a cross-section (normally uniform along the fiber length) consisting of one, two or more materials, most commonly arranged periodically over much of the cross-section. This zone is known as the &quot;cladding&quot; and surrounds a core (or several cores) where light is confined. For example, the fibers first demonstrated by Philip Russell consisted of a hexagonal lattice of air holes in a silica fiber, with a solid or hollow core at the center where light is guided. Other arrangements include concentric rings of two or more materials, first proposed as &quot;Bragg fibers&quot; by Yeh and Yariv, bow-tie, panda, and elliptical hole structures (used to achieve higher birefringence due to irregularity in the relative refractive index), spiral designs which allow for better control over optical properties as individual parameters can be changed.

(Note: PCFs and, in particular, Bragg fibers, should not be confused with fiber Bragg gratings, which consist of a periodic refractive index or structural variation along the fiber axis, as opposed to variations in the transverse directions as in PCF. Both PCFs and fiber Bragg gratings employ Bragg diffraction phenomena, albeit in different directions.)

The lowest reported attenuation of solid core photonic crystal fiber is 0.37 dB/km, and for hollow core is 1.2 dB/km.

== Construction ==
Generally, such fibers are constructed by the same methods as other optical fibers: first, one constructs a &quot;preform&quot; on the scale of centimeters in size, and then heats the preform and draws it down to a much smaller diameter (often nearly as small as a human hair), shrinking the preform cross section but (usually) maintaining the same features. In this way, kilometers of fiber can be produced from a single preform. Air holes are most commonly created by gathering hollow rods into a bundle, and heating the bundle to fuse it into a single rod with ordered holes before drawing, although drilling/milling was used to produce the first aperiodic designs. This formed the subsequent basis for producing the first soft glass and polymer structured fibers.

Most photonic crystal fibers have been fabricated in silica glass, but other glasses have also been used to obtain particular optical properties (such as high optical non-linearity). There is also a growing interest in making them from polymer, where a wide variety of structures have been explored, including graded index structures, ring structured fibers and hollow core fibers. These polymer fibers have been termed &quot;MPOF&quot;, short for microstructured polymer optical fibers. A combination of a polymer and a chalcogenide glass was used by Temelkuran &quot;et al.&quot; in 2002 for 10.6 μm wavelengths (where silica is not transparent).

== Modes of operation ==

Photonic crystal fibers can be divided into two modes of operation, according to their mechanism for confinement: index guiding and photonic bandgap. 

Index guiding photonic crystal fibers are characterized by a core with a higher average refractive index than that of the cladding. The simplest way to accomplish this is to maintain a solid core, surrounded by a cladding region of the same material but interspersed with air holes, as the refractive index of the air will necessarily lower the average refractive index of the cladding. These photonic crystal fibers operate on the same index-guiding principle as conventional optical fiber—however, they can have a much higher effective refractive index contrast between core and cladding, and therefore can have much stronger confinement for applications in nonlinear optical devices, polarization-maintaining fibers. Alternatively, they can also be made with much &quot;lower&quot; effective index contrast.

Alternatively, one can create a photonic bandgap photonic crystal fiber, in which the light is confined by a photonic bandgap created by the microstructured cladding—such a bandgap, properly designed, can confine light in a &quot;lower-index&quot; core and even a hollow (air) core. Bandgap fibers with hollow cores can potentially circumvent limits imposed by available materials, for example to create fibers that guide light in wavelengths for which transparent materials are not available (because the light is primarily in the air, not in the solid materials). Another potential advantage of a hollow core is that one can dynamically introduce materials into the core, such as a gas that is to be analyzed for the presence of some substance. PCF can also be modified by coating the holes with sol-gels of similar or different index material to enhance the transmittance of light.

== History ==
The term &quot;photonic-crystal fiber&quot; was coined by Philip Russell in 1995–1997 (he states (2003) that the idea dates to unpublished work in 1991).

<text>Black Sabbath () is a 1963 horror anthology film directed by Mario Bava. The film consists of three separate tales that are introduced by Boris Karloff. The order in which the stories are presented varies among the different versions in which the film has been released. In the original, Italian print, the first story, titled &quot;The Telephone&quot;, involves Rosy (Michèle Mercier) who continually receives threatening telephone calls from an unseen stalker. The second is &quot;The Wurdulak&quot;, where a man named Gorca (Karloff) returns to his family after claiming to have slain a Wurdulak, an undead creature who attacks those that it had once loved. The third story, &quot;The Drop of Water&quot;, is centered on Helen Corey (Jacqueline Pierreux), a nurse who steals a ring from a corpse that is being prepared for burial and finds herself haunted by the ring&#x27;s original owner after arriving home.

Being a low-budget horror film with multiple stories, an international cast and foreign financial backing, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; follows numerous trends of 1960s Italian film productions. The film is credited to various writers, including Anton Chekov and Aleksey Tolstoy, but is predominantly based on several uncredited sources, and changes were made to the script after filming commenced. American International Pictures and Titra Sound Corporation suggested changes to Bava during filming to make the film palatable for American audiences, and created their own English-language version of the film, which replaced Roberto Nicolosi&#x27;s score with music by Les Baxter, removed several depictions of graphic violence and made alterations to other scenes. This version greatly changed the plot of &quot;The Telephone&quot;, giving it a supernatural element and removing all references to lesbianism and prostitution.

&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was a commercial failure upon release in Italy, and performed below expectations in America. A spiritual sequel to the film, based on &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; and provisionally titled &quot;Scarlet Friday&quot;, was set to reunite Bava with Karloff and co-star Christopher Lee, but AIP distanced themselves from Bava following the failure of &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs&quot; and eventually produced the film without Bava, Karloff or Lee&#x27;s involvement. Plans for a remake were announced in 2004 with Jonathan Hensleigh attached to write the script. Since its original release, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; has received positive reviews from critics, and was placed at number 73 on a &quot;Time Out&quot; poll of the best horror films.

== Plot ==
:&quot;Note: This plot summary refers to the original Italian version of the film.&quot;

=== &quot;The Telephone&quot; ===
Rosy, a French call-girl, returns to her basement apartment at night. She receives a series of strange phone calls. The caller eventually identifies himself as Frank, her former pimp who has recently escaped from prison. Rosy is terrified knowing that it was her testimony that sent Frank to prison. Rosy phones her friend and former lover, Mary for solace. The women have been estranged, but Rosy is certain that only Mary can help her. Mary agrees to come over that night. Seconds later, Frank calls again, promising that no matter what Rosy does he will have his revenge. Rosy doesn&#x27;t realize that Mary is impersonating Frank on the telephone. Mary arrives at Rosy&#x27;s apartment and attempts to calm Rosy&#x27;s nerves. Mary provides Rosy with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.

As Rosy sleeps, Mary writes a confession explaining that she made the calls to force a reunion, knowing that Rosy would call on her for help. While she is writing Frank quietly enters the apartment and strangles Mary, believing her to be Rosy. The sound of their struggle awakens Rosy, and Frank realizes he murdered the wrong woman. Frank approaches Rosy&#x27;s bed, but she seizes her knife and stabs Frank. Rosy drops the knife and breaks down in hysteria.

=== &quot;The Wurdulak&quot; ===
In 19th-century Serbia, Vladimir D&#x27;Urfe is a young nobleman who finds a beheaded corpse with a dagger plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small farmhouse. Durfe is approached by Giorgio, who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who has not been seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to D&#x27;Urfe and introduces him to the rest of the family: his wife Maria, their young son Ivan, Giorgio&#x27;s younger brother Pietro, and sister Sdenka. They all await the return of Giorgio, Pietro and Sdenka&#x27;s father, Gorca, who has gone hunting for a Turkish brigand who&#x27;s actually a wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of loved ones. At midnight, Gorca returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca, who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan&#x27;s corpse. Giorgio plans to stab Ivan in the heart as he has done for Pietro to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his hysterical wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.

That same night, their child appears outside and begs to be invited in. Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she attempts to let in her son. On opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca, who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide in the ruins of a deserted monastery. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying in her bed at home. She begs him to leave but Vladimir refuses, saying he would rather die than lose her. As Vladimir embraces her she bites his neck while the rest of her family watch through the window.

=== &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; ===
In 1910s London, Nurse Helen Chester is called by the maid of an elderly medium to prepare the latter&#x27;s corpse for burial. As she dresses the body, she notices an expensive sapphire ring on its finger. Chester steals it, accidentally tipping over a glass of water which drips on the floor; she is then annoyed by a fly. Chester takes the ring home to her flat and witnesses strange events. The fly returns and continues to pester her and the lights in her apartment go out as the sound of the dripping water is heard from various locations. Chester sees the woman&#x27;s corpse lying on her bed. It rises and floats towards her. Chester begs for forgiveness but the corpse appears to strangle her - in reality she strangles herself. The next morning, the concierge discovers Chester&#x27;s body and calls the police. The pathologist arrives to examine the body and only finds a small bruise on her left finger where the ring had been. As the doctor announces this observation, the concierge appears distressed and hears the dripping of water.

== Production ==

===Development===
In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired Italian talent agent and producer Fulvio Lucisano to look for commercially viable Italian films for them after the large success of the Italian feature &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures made a deal with the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in &quot;Spy in Your Eye&quot; which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the earlier sword-and-sandal films.

===Pre-production===
The casting and crewing of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was divided between the film&#x27;s three main production partners: Galatea cast actress Susy Andersen while retaining Mario Bava, who had directed several of their films, including &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, American International Pictures secured Mark Damon and Boris Karloff, and Societé Cinématographique Lyre secured Michèle Mercier and Jacqueline Pierreux (the latter is credited under the pseudonym &quot;Jacqueline Soussard&quot; on American prints). Mercier had previously worked with Bava on &quot;The Wonders of Aladdin&quot; (1961), for which he had directed its second unit.

Bava is credited as writing the film&#x27;s script along with Alberto Bevilacqua and Marcello Fondato. The film&#x27;s opening credits credit the stories as &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; by Anton Chekov, &quot;The Telephone&quot; by F.G. Snyder and &quot;Sem&#x27;ya vurdalaka&quot; by Aleksey Tolstoy. Bava later took credit for the original story of &quot;The Drop of Water&quot;, but Italian critic Antonio Bruscini traced its origins to a story titled &quot;Dalle tre alle tre e mezzo&quot; (&quot;Between Three and Three-thirty&quot;) that was included in a 1960 anthology book titled &quot;Storie di fantasmi&quot; (&quot;Ghost Stories&quot;). British historian Julian Granger identified the author of the story as Franco Lucentini. &quot;The Wurdulak&quot; is loosely based on &quot;The Family of the Vourdalak&quot; by Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy The story of &quot;The Wurdulak&quot; was found in the 1960 anthology &quot;I vampiri tra noi&quot;. Other parts of the story were inspired by the Guy de Maupassant story &quot;Fear&quot; and Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Bevilacqua stated that Bava wanted to create stories about how terror can strike mankind in different time periods and asked his screenwriters to get him stories from books. After Bevilacqua finished his draft the screenplay, Marcello Fondato was brought in to work on it. Bevilacqua claimed that he was recalled for later rewrites but that most of his added material was cut from the final film. American International Pictures approved of Bava&#x27;s thematic idea but encouraged him to look for public domain titles.

It was decided early in production that Boris Karloff would not only star in one of the tales, but also act as the film&#x27;s host; he had recently hosted his own anthology television series, &quot;Thriller&quot;. Karloff was under contract with American International Pictures, and had just completed filming &quot;The Raven&quot; for them. The film&#x27;s cinematographer is credited as Ubaldo Terzano but Bava shot several scenes himself without credit.

===Filming===
&quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was made at the end of production of &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International&#x27;s involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as it had to be done rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences, which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title &quot;The Fear&quot;.

Bava wanted to include a contemporary story which led to the development of &quot;The Telephone&quot;. &quot;The Telephone&quot; has been described as one of Bava&#x27;s first attempts at a giallo film. The &quot;giallo&quot; film is a style of Italian film that involves a murder mystery that emphasized stylish visuals, flamboyant music and violence. &quot;The Telephone&quot; was Bava&#x27;s first color film that attempted to emulate the visual style of the covers that appeared on &quot;giallo&quot; digests. Some of the set pieces for &quot;The Telephone&quot; were taken from the black-and-white &quot;giallo&quot; film &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1962).

&quot;The Wurdulak&quot; was the last of the short films to be shot, with shooting commencing on either February 25 or 27. While filming, Karloff contracted pneumonia, which led to him having to rely on oxygen tanks after production ended. Bava was initially going to end the film on a shot of Jacqueline Pierreux&#x27;s dead character. On the last day of filming, Billitteri suggested to not end the film on such a bleak image and told Bava to change it. Bava changed the ending to Boris Karloff&#x27;s character of Gorka on horseback who cautions the audience to watch out for vampires. The camera then pans back revealing he is on a stuffed horse revealing the studio set and simulated effects.

===Post-production===

By the 1960s, Italian horror films such as &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; were more violent, sexualized and downbeat than the horror films created in America. American International Pictures focused on a youth-oriented audience whereas horror in Europe was intended for adults. This led to the American edit removing plot elements of prostitution and lesbianism and making the most altered of Bava&#x27;s films on its English-language version. American International Pictures made changes to all three stories and intro segments in the English-language version of the film. The company re-arranged the order of the stories to start with &quot;The Drop of Water&quot;, followed by &quot;The Telephone&quot; and then &quot;The Wurdalak&quot;. Changes were then made to the plots, the most extensively edited being &quot;The Telephone&quot;. In &quot;The Telephone&quot; any suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Rosy and Mary and references to prostitution were removed. The character of Frank is also no longer a pimp but a ghost who leaves behind a note that eerily writes itself as soon as the envelope it is contained in is opened. A new character is introduced named &quot;The Colonel&quot; who is Rosy&#x27;s neighbor in the film. &quot;The Wurdalak&quot; features alternative cuts of certain scenes and has violence trimmed from the Italian version. &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; features the fewest changes from the Italian version. American International Pictures reshot the wraparounds with Boris Karloff in Los Angeles. It is unknown who directed these scenes.

American International Pictures replaced Roberto Nicolosi&#x27;s soundtrack from the original film with a soundtrack from Les Baxter. Kim Newman described Baxter&#x27;s score as &quot;inappropriate&quot; with &quot;each shock is accompanied by overdone &#x27;scary music&#x27;&quot;. Both the Italian- and English-language films have a different look. Bava supervised the Italian-language version at Technicolor Roma under his own supervision, while American International Pictures shipped their version to Pathé Color for processing. Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas described the English-language print as looking &quot;warmer, but less nuanced, with flatter tonalities&quot; and that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t look bad&quot; but that the Italian version &quot;looks more vibrant, more flamboyantly nightmarish&quot;.

==Release==
The film opened in Italy through Warner Bros. on August 17, 1963, under the title &quot;I tre volti della paura&quot; (). &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; grossed 103.5 million Italian lira (equivalent to $65,000) on its original Italian release compared to its 205 million lira budget, making the film a box office bomb. Co-writer Alberto Bevilacqua suggested that the film&#x27;s poor performance was possibly affected by bad publicity, recalling that &quot;someone had a miscarriage while watching it, or some other upsetting thing happened&quot;.

American International Pictures released the English version of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; on May 6, 1964, as a double bill with AIP&#x27;s edit of Bava&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot;, then titled &quot;Evil Eye&quot;. The English title of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was chosen to connect it with Bava&#x27;s previous film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;. In the US, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was only a modest success, earning $419,000 in domestic rentals, less than two-thirds of &quot;Black Sunday&quot;&#x27;s earnings of $706,000. While praising Reynold Brown&#x27;s artwork for AIP&#x27;s advertising campaign, Lucas has suggested that its failure to capitalize on Karloff&#x27;s popularity among young audiences was a key factor in the film&#x27;s relatively meager commercial performance. The film was released by The Rank Organisation in France on 17 November 1965, under the title &quot;Les trois visages de la peur&quot;; Lucas deemed one of the poster artworks used for the French release, created by Boris Grinsson and depicting Mercier, Andersen and Pierreux being menaced by a would-be strangler&#x27;s hands, to be the &quot;most beautiful&quot; of all promotional materials produced for the film.

In 2004, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Valhalla Motion Pictures and Kismet Entertainment Group were collaborating to produce a remake &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;. Jonathan Hensleigh was attached to contribute to the script development of the film.

===Home video===
The film was released on DVD in 2000. Kino released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino&#x27;s edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow&#x27;s transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow&#x27;s version of the American version of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was made from a 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy was very difficult to restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the stories in the wrong order.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review of the American International Picture&#x27;s edit, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; stated that &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; and &quot;The Telephone&quot; were &quot;a good deal more sophisticated than usual horror fare&quot; while &quot;The Wurdulak&quot; &quot;bears no trace of [Bava&#x27;s] manner of directing&quot; and that the acting was &quot;rudimentary&quot;. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; gave the film a negative review, referring to the &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; as &quot;three short films botched together&quot;. The &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated that &quot;the eeriest thing about the picture is its decor (especially the heavy, dusty interiors of [The Drop of Water]&quot; while noting the &quot;acting is very unstylish and made worse by dubbing&quot;. The review stated that Bava could &quot;do better than this with less obvious material&quot; and that he seemed &quot;determined to spell everything out with a sudden zoom shots and shock cuts.&quot;

Reviewing the English-language version of the film, &quot;Time Out&quot; praised the film stating that &quot;pictorially it&#x27;s amazing, and even the script and dubbing are way above average.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; compared the film to anthology horror films made by the British production company Amicus noting that &quot;If only Amicus...had taken heed they might have got some ideas as to what can be done with the format.&quot;
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; awarded the film an A− rating referring to it as &quot;excellent&quot; and that the stories were &quot;composed of three tales of expertly building suspense&quot; Kim Newman wrote in a retrospective review of the English dub, that &quot;The Drop of Water&quot; is the best of the three stories, and was described as &quot;Bava&#x27;s most simply frightening work.&quot; &quot;The Telephone&quot; was dismissed as being &quot;less satisfying&quot;, stating that American International Pictures&#x27; attempt at re-writing the story caused the stories&#x27; problems. Newman declared that &quot;The Wurdalak&quot; was a &quot;little masterpiece&quot; praising Karloff&#x27;s performance and that the themes of the story looked towards the themes in &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot;.

In contemporary reviews of the Italian-language version, &quot;The Dissolve&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of five, stating &quot;There are small twists in all three stories, but for the most part, the segments suggest where they&#x27;re headed early&quot; and that the dialogue in the film is &quot;sparse, and doesn&#x27;t shy away from any exploitable elements, from scantily clad women to bloody wounds and warped-faced ghouls. But even more terrifying is the movie&#x27;s atmosphere of doom [...] &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; is fraught with fatalism.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; awarded the film four stars out of five, referring to it as a &quot;wonderful horror anthology&quot;. In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films; &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; placed at number 73 on their top list.

==Influence and aftermath==

Boris Karloff enjoyed working with Bava on &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, and he praised his work to both Christopher Lee and Vincent Price who would later go on to work with Bava in &quot;The Whip and the Body&quot; and &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs&quot; respectively. Plans were made to reunite Bava with Karloff and Lee to work an adaptation of &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, provisionally titled &quot;Scarlet Friday&quot;. The project was later taken away from Bava after the critical and commercial failure of &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs&quot;, and was released as &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; directed by Daniel Haller; the film was made without Karloff and Lee&#x27;s involvement.

The English heavy metal band Black Sabbath appropriated their name from the film. Originally known as Earth, the group wanted to change their name as another group had the same name. The group saw a local cinema playing &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and marveled that people paid money to be frightened.

Directors Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino were influenced by &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;&#x27;s story structure for their original script for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). The film was originally going to contain three short films directed by Avary, Tarantino and another unknown director. Tarantino originally described this idea by stating that &quot;what Mario Bava did with the horror film in &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, I was gonna do with the crime film.&quot;

<text>Nicola Barker (born 30 March 1966) is an English novelist and short story writer.

==Early life and education==
Barker was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England on 30 March 1966. While still young, her parents left England and settled in South Africa.

==Career==
Barker typically writes about damaged or eccentric people in mundane situations, and has a fondness for bleak, isolated settings. &quot;Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Behindlings&quot; are set respectively on the Isle of Sheppey and Canvey Island. Together with &quot;Darkmans&quot; (2007), they form an informal trilogy based around the Thames Gateway. 
&quot;Darkmans&quot; won the 2008 Hawthornden Prize. Patrick Ness&#x27;s review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the book as &quot;phenomenally good&quot; despite it being an &quot;838-page epic with little describable plot, taking place over just a few days and set in...Ashford&quot;

Her 2004 novel, &quot;Clear&quot;, is set in London during David Blaine&#x27;s &quot;Above the Below&quot; 44-day fast in London in 2003.

<doc id="1004977" wikidata="Q1178801" url="?curid=1004977" title="Microlepidoptera">
<text>Microlepidoptera (micromoths) is an artificial (i.e., unranked and not monophyletic) grouping of moth families, commonly known as the &quot;smaller moths&quot; (micro, Lepidoptera). These generally have wingspans of under 20 mm, so are harder to identify by external phenotypic markings than macrolepidoptera. They present some lifestyles that the larger Lepidoptera do not have, but this is not an identifying mark. Some hobbyists further divide this group into separate groups, such as leaf miners or rollers, stem or root borers, and then usually follow the more rigorous scientific taxonomy of lepidopterans. Efforts to stabilize the term have usually proven inadequate.

== Diversity ==

Vernacular usage divides the Lepidoptera simply into smaller and larger or into more-primitive and less-primitive groups, microlepidoptera and macrolepidoptera, respectively. Intuitively, the &quot;micros&quot; are any lepidopteran not currently placed in the macrolepidoptera. This paraphyletic assemblage, however, includes also the superfamilies Zygaenoidea, Sesioidea, and Cossoidea that would in common parlance normally be lumped with the &quot;macros&quot;. A lepidopterist might call these groups &quot;primitive macros&quot;. Furthermore, even all of the nonditrysian moths are not small. For example, the Hepialidae or &quot;swift moths&quot; (up to 25 cm wingspan) fall quite basally in the lepidopteran &quot;tree of life&quot;. The recently discovered primitive superfamily Andesianoidea is another case in point; lurking within the Cossoidae until 2001, these moths have up to an order of magnitude greater wingspan (5.5 cm) than most previously known monotrysian &quot;micros&quot;. Whilst the smaller moths are usually also more seldom noticed, a more expansive &quot;nonmacrolepidopteran&quot; concept of the microlepidoptera would include about 37 out of the roughly 47 superfamilies.

Whilst usually less popular, micros are thus more important in the sense that they include a much wider span of the &quot;tree of life&quot; (i.e., phylogenetic diversity). Whereas they include no butterflies, micros do also include a surprising number of day-flying groups, and the advent of online identification resources in many countries (e.g. &quot;UK moths&quot;) combined with the widespread use of digital macrophotography, is making them much easier to identify.

== Lifestyle ==

Microlepidoptera can be found in a broad variety of habitats and ecological niches worldwide, both terrestrial and freshwater aquatic (e.g. Acentropinae). They have a wide variety of feeding habits in both larval and adult life stages. Caterpillars feed on a wide variety of plant tissue and across a wide spectrum of plant groups from liverworts to angiosperms. They are either external feeders (&quot;exophagous&quot;) or more usually feed internally (&quot;endophagous&quot;), typically as miners or tunnellers, but some feed on fungi, scavenge on dead animals, are parasitoids usually of other insects (some Zygaenoidea) or are detritivores, and &quot;Hyposmocoma molluscivora&quot; even feeds on live snails. Adult moths feed with mandibles on spores and pollen (Micropterigidae) on dew (e.g. Eriocraniidae), with their probosces on nectar (many groups e.g. Choreutidae) or are simply nonfeeding with mouthparts reduced or absent. The larvae of many smaller moths are considered economic pests, causing damage to plants, as well as fabrics and other manmade goods. Commonly noticed &quot;micros&quot; include the plume moth and the various species of clothes moth.

== Main groups ==

The list below is ordered initially in approximate order of species diversity and ecological abundance. The first four superfamilies listed here may comprise 90% of species in a sample of smaller moths and the listed characters may be of some assistance to sort these out, particularly the form of the labial palp and scaling of the proboscis (Robinson et al. 2001).

1. Curved horn moths, twirler moths, case-bearers and allies – 16,250 spp.

* Gelechioidea: Head smooth-scaled, labial palps usually are slender, recurved, with the terminal segment long and pointed; the long proboscis bears scales on basal half. Resting posture very varied.
** Gelechiidae – twirler moths
** Oecophoridae – concealer moths
** Lecithoceridae – tropical longhorned moths
** Cosmopterigidae – cosmet moths
** Coleophoridae – case-bearers
** Elachistidae – grass-miner miners
** Momphidae – mompha moths
** Ethmiidae
** Blastobasidae – scavenger moths
** Batrachedridae – flower moths
** Scythrididae – flower moths
** Pterolonchidae – lance-wing moths

2. Pyralids, snout moths and grass moths – 16,000 spp.

* Pyraloidea: Head rough-scaled, proboscis scaled, tympanal organs on abdomen; labial palps usually not recurved, terminal segment usually blunt. Hindwing veins (&quot;Sc&quot; + &quot;R1&quot;) and &quot;Rs&quot; are close or fused in the middle of the wing; resting posture usually either with wings tightly rolled or and held quite flat to surface in triangular shape and with labial palps often projecting forward, giving Concorde-like appearance; antennae often swept back parallel together over body. Generally they are considered the closest group to &#x27;macrolepidoptera&#x27;, and maybe ancestral to it, macrolepidoptera itself is not a universally accepted taxon.
** Pyralidae – pyrales or snout moths
** Crambidae – grass moths

3. Tortrix moths, leaf-roller moths, bell moths, codling moths and allies – 6,200 spp.

* Tortricidae: Head rough-scaled, labial palps with short blunt apical segment, basal half of proboscis not scaled; wings held over back in tent-like or flattened position; forewing costa often quite strongly or sinuate in many Tortricinae giving bell-like shape

4. Clothes moths, bagworms and allies – 4,200 spp.

* Tineoidea: Head often with tufty erect scales; labial palps usually have bristles on middle segment and terminal segment is long; wings usually held over back in tent-like position and head close to surface; tineids often run fast
** Tineidae – clothes moths and fungus moths
** Eriocottidae – Old World spiny winged moths
** Acrolophidae – tube moths
** Arrhenophanidae – tropical lattice moths
** Psychidae – bagworm moths
** Lypusidae – European bagworm moths

<text>Capsicum pubescens is a plant of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; (pepper). The species name, &quot;pubescens&quot;, refers to the hairy leaves of this pepper. The hairiness of the leaves, along with the black seeds, make &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; distinguishable from other Capsicum species. &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; has pungent yellow, orange, red, green or brown fruits. 

This species is found primarily in Central and South America, and is known only in cultivation. It is consumed fresh, as a paste, dried, or ground. It is called &quot;rocoto&quot; (Quechua, &quot;rukutu&quot;, &quot;ruqutu&quot;) in Peru and Ecuador, &quot;locoto&quot; in Bolivia and Argentina (Aymara, &quot;luqutu&quot;), and in Mexico &quot;manzano&quot; (Spanish for &quot;appletree&quot;) pepper for its apple-shaped fruit. Of all the domesticated species in the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;, it is the least widespread and most genetically distinct.

==Description==
===Vegetative characteristics===
Like all other species of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot;, plants of the species &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; grow as a shrub, but sometimes as climbing plants. They grow into four-meter woody plants relatively quickly, and live up to 15 years, which gives them, especially with age, an almost tree-like appearance. After initial growth, the plant branches at a height of about 30 cm for the first time, and further growth divides into a bushy appearance. More shoots develop from the leaf axils. Some varieties have purple discoloration on the branches, as can be observed in other &quot;Capsicum&quot; species. The leaves have a 5–12 mm long petiole and a leaf blade ovate to 5–12 cm long, 2.5 to 4 cm wide, tapering at the top and the base is wedge-shaped.

In addition to the relatively long life, &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; differs in many other characteristics from related species.

===Flowers===
The flowers appear singly or in pairs (rarely up to four) on the shoots, and the branches are at about 1 cm long flower stems, which extend on the fruit to around 4–5 cm. The calyx has five triangular pointed teeth, which have in the fruit a length of about 1 mm. A characteristic different from other cultivated species of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; is the blue-violet-colored petals, brighter in the centre. The anthers are partly purple, partly white.

=== Phytochemicals ===

==== Capsaicinoids ====
Capsaicinoids (capsaicin) are naturally occurring phytochemicals responsible for the heat in chili peppers. While other chili varieties are dominated with up to 80 % by capsaicin, &quot;C. pubescens&quot; has an almost equally high concentration of dihydrocapsaicin. 

&quot;C. pubescens&quot; is a domesticated chili pepper that has not been explored extensively for its phytochemicals. While some types of &quot;C.pubescens&quot; are considered mild, other varieties are some of the hottest peppers. The pungency level varies according to two different studies between 2400-31,000 Scoville scale, 15,000-80,000 Scoville scale and 50,000-250,000 Scoville scale.

&quot;C. pubescens&quot; is a poor source of carotenoids and has a low amount of ascorbic acid and total polyphenols compared to &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;. Furthermore, removing the seeds of this pepper during food processing reduces the total polyphenol content by 50%.

==== Aroma ====
The growing interest for this species is related to its cucumber aroma. The aromatic structure of &quot;C.pubescens&quot; is different than that of other chili peppers. Four aromas are dominant in the odor profile: green, cucumber, earthy-peas, and paprika or bell pepper, due possibly to the higher amount of sulfur and nitrogen compounds (pyrazine) and cucumber-like aldehydes with a low contribution to esters and ionones. The aromatic differences between &quot;C. chinense&quot; (a commonly used chili pepper) and &quot;C. pubescens&quot; is the contribution of several ionone esters and ectocarpene. This explains the exotic, fruity aromatic character of &quot;C. chinense&quot;, which is presented only in small quantities in &quot;C. pubescens&quot;. 

== Uses ==
=== Food properties ===
The fruits of &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; are a versatile food in South American cuisine. The flesh is thicker than that of other chilis, closer to the consistency and size of bell peppers. The level of spice is comparable to other common known chilis, with 50,000 to 250,000 Scoville Heat Units recorded.

=== Fresh uses ===
The seeds and the white membranes, which contain most of the spice, are cut out. It is advised to wear gloves when handling &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot;. To reduce the spiciness the fruits can be boiled. The prepared rocoto chilis are used for a variety of dishes.
Rocoto relleno is a popular dish in Arequipa, a city in the Andes of Peru. The hollowed out and boiled rocotos are filled up with a mixture of ground beef, onions, garlic and spices. It is topped off with a piece of cheese and baked in the oven. The fruits of the &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; are also used as additions to other meals. Chili paste is made by mixing the chilis with oil. Chili cream is made by mixing rocoto chilis with fresh cheese. Aji de Huacatay is a green sauce which contains green rocoto chilis and is served typically with potatoes. Additionally, rocotos are used for fresh salsas.

=== Processed uses ===
Due to the thick flesh and the high moisture content, drying of peppers solely with sunlight is not as effective as with other species of Capsicum. A closed drying tunnel can reduce the moisture of 80 kilograms of fresh rocoto to 6.4 kilograms of dried rocoto.

== Origin and distribution ==
&quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is native to Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, dating to pre-Incan times. Traces of its presence have been found in the Guitarrero Caves. The existence of &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; was documented by ancient Peruvians of the Paracas, Nazca, Moche, and Chimu cultures, through textiles, ceramics, and domestic remains. &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is likely to belong to the oldest domesticated plants in the Americas, its domestication dating back to 6000 BC. &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is believed to have evolved from other, more primitive wild &quot;Capsicum&quot; species occurring in the same area. Of all the domesticated species of peppers, this is the least widespread and genetically furthest away from all others. It is reproductively isolated from other species of the genus &quot;Capsicum&quot; and forms a distinct genetic lineage. In the early 1900&#x27;s &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; was introduced to Indonesia where it is now grown along other Capsicum species. The routes of introductions remain unclear, as &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is found on multiple Indonesian islands. A white flower mutant of &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is widely distributed in West and Central Java, which differentiates it from the normally purple flowering plants.

&quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is rare outside of Central America, being found in cultivation primarily in Bolivia and Peru where it likely originated. It is commonly cultivated from Mexico to Peru, as well as in Indonesia. The plants are usually grown at small scale in courtyards and family gardens, and only surpluses reach markets. 

Given its cold tolerance, &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; grows at higher elevations than other species, and cannot survive the tropical heat in the lowlands. However, &quot;Capsicum pubescens&quot; is not frost-tolerant and requires a long vegetation period of about 9 months. These climate requirements are the main challenges for introducing it to other locations.

== Cultivation ==

=== Production ===
The Viru and Lambayeque valleys are the main production areas, 1000 km north of the capital of Peru. In the Netherlands, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers share more than 90% gross area of greenhouse production. Between April and November, &quot;C. pubescens&quot; is grown in greenhouses in the Netherlands. In the rest of the year, it has limited availability, and is grown in Spain or Italy.

=== Planting ===
&quot;C. pubescens&quot; is genetically different and unique in &quot;Capsicum&quot;, as it is the only one to tolerate cooler temperatures. A clear temperature difference during the day (15 °C) and at night (8 °C) is preferred, which is similar to the mountainous regions of Peru and Bolivia. However, frost and high heat cause serious damage.

Cultivation methods of &quot;C. pubescens&quot; include growing in a nursery for 1 to 1.5 months in early February, then planting in the field when there is no frost risk, generally around March. Potassium, magnesium and zinc are used after transplantation, or after branching or flowering, and are generally applied once every 2 months after harvesting began. Some farmers cultivate &quot;C. pubescens&quot; among tea trees, &quot;C. annuum&quot;, or other crops.

=== Pests ===
The plants resist pests in Europe. However, &quot;C. pubescens&quot; is the host plant of &quot;Anastrepha ludens&quot; (Mexican fruit fly). &quot;A. ludens&quot; is one of the most threatening pests of &quot;Anastrepha&quot;. It is considered an A1 quarantine pest by EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization). Thus, the importation of fresh &quot;C. pubescens&quot; is restricted by many countries, and only frozen and manufactured import food are authorized in European market.

=== Pathogens ===
The plants are resistant to several diseases, including the oomycete pathogen &quot;Phytophthora capsici&quot;, a severe pathogen of pepper production over the world, causing more than $100 million in losses annually. &quot;C. pubescens&quot; has a thick waxy cuticle which becomes detached during the infection process, called &quot;pealing pealing&quot; disease in the areas around Oxapampa, Peru.

=== Harvesting ===
&quot;C. pubescens&quot; matures at least 3 months after flowering, with harvesting 3 to 8 months after transplantation into fields. Fruits were collected weekly every 2 weeks, and the harvesting is continued for 2-3 years, up to 5 years before the occurrence of diseases. Yields produce approximately 0.5 kg per plant per harvest, from up to 40 chilies for one meter tall.

<text>Goodpasture syndrome (GPS), also known as anti–glomerular basement membrane disease, is a rare autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the basement membrane in lungs and kidneys, leading to bleeding from the lungs, glomerulonephritis, and kidney failure. It is thought to attack the alpha-3 subunit of type IV collagen, which has therefore been referred to as Goodpasture&#x27;s antigen. Goodpasture syndrome may quickly result in permanent lung and kidney damage, often leading to death. It is treated with medications that suppress the immune system such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and with plasmapheresis, in which the antibodies are removed from the blood. Due to the GPS&#x27;s rapid progression, the significant difficulty of treating the disease is identifying it early and making the appropriate response before severe damage occurs to the kidneys and or lungs. Consequently, the standard treatment plan of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis is vigorous and fast-acting, including high plasma volume exchange and an intensive dose of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide based on the patient&#x27;s body weight in kilograms. 

The disease was first described by an American pathologist Ernest Goodpasture of Vanderbilt University in 1919 and was later named in his honor.

==Signs and symptoms==
The anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies primarily attack the kidneys and lungs, although, generalized symptoms like malaise, weight loss, fatigue, fever, and chills are also common, as are joint aches and pains. 60–80% of those with the condition experience both lung and kidney involvement; 20–40% have kidney involvement alone, and less than 10% have lung involvement alone. Kidney symptoms usually include blood in the urine, protein in the urine, unexplained swelling of limbs or face, high amounts of urea in the blood, and high blood pressure. Lung symptoms usually antedate kidney symptoms and usually include: coughing up blood, chest pain (in less than 50% of cases overall), cough, and shortness of breath. Some other signs and symptoms that could be used to identify Goodpasture syndrome during a physical exam include an increased respiratory rate, cyanosis, crackles, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypertension.

==Cause==
While the exact cause is unknown, the genetic predisposition to GPS involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, specifically &quot;HLA-DR15&quot;. In addition to genetic susceptibility, an initial environmental insult to the pulmonary vasculature is needed to allow the anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies to reach the alveolar capillaries. Examples of such an insult include: exposure to organic solvents (e.g. chloroform) or hydrocarbons, exposure to tobacco smoke, infection (such as influenza A), cocaine inhalation, metal dust inhalation, bacteremia, sepsis, high-oxygen environments, and antilymphocyte therapies (especially with monoclonal antibodies). Exposure to dry cleaning chemicals and paraquat herbicide have also been implicated as potential insults. In GPS, anti-GBM antibodies are produced and circulated throughout the bloodstream, damaging the membranes lining the lungs and kidneys as well as targeting their capillaries.

==Pathophysiology==
GPS is caused by abnormal plasma cell production of anti-GBM antibodies. The major target of these abnormal antibodies is the non-collagen domain of the alpha-3 chain of type 4 collagen, which is mostly found in the basal membranes of glomerular and alveolar capillaries, explaining the obscurely specific symptoms of this condition. This preferred targeting of these alpha-3 collagen chains specifically in the basal membranes of glomerular and alveolar capillaries can be explained by the higher accessible exposure of epitopes, a larger expansion of the alpha-3 collagen units, and because these alpha-3 collagen chains structurally provide higher accessibility for the targeting antibodies. These antibodies bind their reactive epitopes to the basement membranes and activate the complement cascade, leading to the death of tagged cells. A specific antibody and epitope binding that shows the highest affinity and is pathogenic occurs between GPA antibodies and the anti-GBM epitope region, designated EA, which is residues 17-31 of the alpha 3 subunit of non-collagenous domain of type IV collagen. T cells are also implicated, though it is generally considered a type II hypersensitivity reaction.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of GPS is often difficult, as numerous other diseases can cause the various manifestations of the condition and the condition itself is rare. The most accurate means of achieving the diagnosis is testing the affected tissues by means of a biopsy, especially the kidney, as it is the best-studied organ for obtaining a sample for the presence of anti-GBM antibodies. On top of the anti-GBM antibodies implicated in the disease, about one in three of those affected also has cytoplasmic antineutrophilic antibodies in their bloodstream, which often predates the anti-GBM antibodies by about a few months or even years. The later the disease is diagnosed, the worse the outcome is for the affected person.

In addition, if there is substantial suspicion of the disease, serologic testing for ELISA assay is usually done by looking for alpha3 NC1 domain area of collagen IV in order to avoid false positives.

==Treatment==
The major mainstay of treatment for GPS is plasmapheresis, a procedure in which the affected person&#x27;s blood is sent through a centrifuge and the various components separated based on weight. The plasma contains the anti-GBM antibodies that attack the affected person&#x27;s lungs and kidneys, and is filtered out. The other parts of the blood (the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) are recycled and intravenously reinfused. Most individuals affected by the disease also need to be treated with immunosuppressant drugs, especially cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and rituximab, to prevent the formation of new anti-GBM antibodies so as to prevent further damage to the kidneys and lungs. Other, less toxic immunosuppressants such as azathioprine may be used to maintain remission.

==Prognosis==
With treatment, the five-year survival rate is &gt;80% and fewer than 30% of affected individuals require long-term dialysis. A study performed in Australia and New Zealand demonstrated that in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (including dialysis) the median survival time is 5.93 years. Without treatment, virtually every affected person will die from either advanced kidney failure or lung hemorrhages.

==Epidemiology==
GPS is rare, affecting about 0.5–1.8 per million people per year in Europe and Asia. It is also unusual among autoimmune diseases in that it is more common in males than in females and is also less common in blacks than whites, but more common in the Māori people of New Zealand. The peak age ranges for the onset of the disease are 20–30 and 60–70 years.

<text>Maxim Biller (born 25 August 1960 in Prague, Czechoslovakia) is a German writer and columnist.

== Early life ==
Born in Prague to Soviet Jewish parents, Rada Biller and Semjon-Jevsej Biller. He emigrated with his parents and sister to West Germany in 1970, when he was ten years old. After living for a long time in Hamburg and Munich, he now lives in Berlin, frequently writing about issues relating to Jewishs and German relations. His maternal grandfather was Armenian.

== Works ==
In 2003 his novel &quot;Esra&quot; excited attention when its sale was prohibited shortly after its release. Two persons had a provisional order obtained, because they claimed to have seen themselves reflected in characters in the book. A German court obliged their request to take the book from circulation on these grounds.

His first works translated into English (by Anthea Bell) are the collection &quot;Love Today&quot; (2008), some of which appeared in &quot;The New Yorker.&quot;

=== Beliefs ===
Biller strongly identifies as a Zionist and is very critical of antisemitism within the anti-Zionist movement.

<text>Ispica (, ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the south of Sicily, Italy. It is from Ragusa, from Syracuse, and away from La Valletta, on the coast of Malta. The first mention in a document of Ispica occurred in 1093, in a list of churches and ecclesiastic departments for administrative purposes, but the territory has been colonized since the Bronze Age.
The city is located on a hill. The main economical activity consists of farming and organic products, especially carrot, zucchini, tomatoes, olives, vineyards. Ispica is the largest producer of organic carrot in
southern Italy with about 18,000 tons of annual production. There is of coastline, most of which is sand and dunes, and an island (Porri island) at from the coast.

The town also hosts examples of Sicilian Baroque architecture such as the Vincenzo Sinatra&#x27;s Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Annunziata Church, the Carmine monastery, and the St. Barthelemy cathedral.

Ispica was destroyed by the 1693 Sicily earthquake and rebuilt on its present site.

==Tourist Information==

The Pro Loco Spaccaforno manages a tourist information point in the city center. 
Tourist information, also in English, is available on the website Visit Ispica. There are a number of processions which take place on Holy Thursday. If traveling to Ispica, the bus station is in a much safer and more convenient location than the train station, which is located on the outskirts of town.

The Cava d&#x27;Ispica (Cave of Ispica) consists of a series of housing units.

==Cava d&#x27;Ispica==

The Cava d&#x27;Ispica (Cave of Ispica) consists of a series of housing units carved in rocky formations. Built prior to the Greek colonization, these houses were used until the end of the nineteenth century. This cave, the most important in Eastern Sicily, is long and is divided among two other comunes, Modica and Rosolini.

<text>Alexander Milne (1742–1838) was a Scottish American entrepreneur and philanthropist and was born in Fochabers, Moray, Scotland. He was employed as a footman by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon and when ordered by the duke to powder his red hair, Milne declined, left his employment and emigrated to the American colonies. By 1776, Milne had moved to New Orleans in Louisiana (New Spain), where, after doing well in the hardware business, he set up a brick-making company using mainly slave labour—by the late 18th century most of the brick used in New Orleans was made at his works.

==Appearance==
Milne was said to be small in stature with a drooping head and his eyes continuously focused on the ground and apparently heedless of things going on around him. Although his dress was shabby causing him on occasion to be mistaken for a beggar he was well regarded by those who knew him.

==Real estate investments==
The Spanish Government granted Milne large tracts of swamp lands bordering on Lake Pontchartrain and seeing the potential for development continued to invest heavily in the area right up until his death. He owned large quantities of land in his own establishment town of Milneburg (now a section of New Orleans) and according to Kendall, in the course of one week disposed of some of his landholdings realising $3,000,000. He continued to invest in property in New Orleans and at his death, his real estate properties were worth more than $2,000,000.

==Death and bequests==
Milne died in October 1838 and was buried in Saint Louis No. 2 Cemetery, New Orleans having made his will only three years earlier. In the will he bequeathed $30,000 to his relatives in his home town of Fochabers, Scotland; he freed his two house servants, gave them land on Esplanade Avenue and ensured that $10,000 would be provided to build two brick houses for them and until such time as the houses were built his executors would pay them $3 per day to support them. The remainder of the will was sectioned into five parts; $100,000 was provided for the founding of a free school for the boys and girls in Fochabers and surrounding area; to the other four his will stated the following:
==Dispute regarding legality of Fochabers bequest==
Louisiana state law prohibited foreign legatees from being able to inherit if the laws of the country in which the legatee resided prevented a citizen of Louisiana from receiving a similar inheritance. Scots Law allowed only British citizens to inherit a legacy. Lengthy litigation was brought by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon on behalf of the town of Fochabers. Louisiana courts twice ruled that the legacy could not be granted but eventually on appeal to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the bequest was finally allowed.

<doc id="1004999" wikidata="Q5199858" url="?curid=1004999" title="Talislanta">
<text>Talislanta is a fantasy role-playing game published by Bard Games in 1987 that forgoes many of the tropes used by popular games of the genre in favor of a unique world and many new game mechanisms. There have been six different English-language editions and several foreign language editions published.

==Contents==
===Setting===
The game is set in Talislanta, a continent on the world of Archaeus. Magic is common and has reached a high level of technology.

===Character creation===
In the 1st to 4th editions, characters are essentially pre-generated, with over 80 character types defined by race, nationality, ability scores, skills, equipment and background. Players pick the type of character they wish to play, then individualize it by increasing one ability by three points; decreasing one ability by one point; and adding an additional skill. PD Breeding-Black was the first artist to work on Talislanta, and was instrumental in creating the look and feel of the First and Second Edition books. Her artwork was integral in establishing the look of Talislanta, and it remains so to the present day.

In the 5th edition, a more complex character generation system was introduced that was similar to other role-playing games.

===Task resolution===
All task resolutions, whether for combat, magic or skills/attributes, are resolved on a single table using a twenty-sided die. Five results are possible: Mishap, Failure, Partial Success, Full Success or Critical Success. The difference between the result gained and the rated difficulty of the task indicates how much of a success or failure was achieved.

==Publishing history==
===1st edition (Bard Games)===
In 1982 Stephan Michael Sechi, Steven Cordovano and Vernie Taylor formed the company Bard Games to produce their own &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplements. In 1986, due to personal and financial disagreements that arose after the publication of &quot;The Atlantis Trilogy&quot;, Sechi sold his shares in Bard Games to Cordovano and left to begin work on a new role-playing game system and its supplements. Cordovano decided that he did not want to run Bard Games and sold it back to Sechi, giving Sechi the opportunity to publish his new game, &quot;Talislanta&quot;. Sechi pointed to the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; fantasy novel series by Jack Vance as the primary influence, but there are many other sources of inspiration as well, including H. P. Lovecraft’s &quot;Dreamquest of Unknown Kadath,&quot; Marco Polo’s &quot;Travels&quot;, and Sir Richard Burton’s collection of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. As game critic Rick Swan stated, &quot;It&#x27;s as if H. P. Lovecraft had written &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, with Hans Christian Andersen and William S. Burroughs as technical advisors.&quot;

After publication of the rules in &quot;The Talislantan Handbook&quot; in 1987, Sechi also published three supplements: &quot;The Chronicles of Talislanta&quot;, &quot;A Naturalist&#x27;s Guide to Talislanta&quot;, and &quot;Talislanta Sorcerer&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

===2nd edition (Bard Games)===
In 1988, Bard Games published a second edition of &quot;Talislanta&quot; starting with &quot;The Cyclopedia Talislanta&quot;. This 88-page softcover book included continental and local maps; a listing of urban centers and important geographical features; and expanded list of flora and fauna; new character types; new types of transportation; and variant rules.

In 1989, Bard Games released &quot;Talislanta Handbook and Campaign Guide&quot;, a 152-page softcover book that combined &quot;The Talislatan Handbook&quot; and material from the three supplements. The book included:
* Rules revisions for combat, magic, skills, and attributes
* New rules for mass combat rules
* Expanded listings of skills, equipment, weapons, and transportation
* A map of the City of Cymril
* A new introductory adventure. 
* New character backgrounds
* Optional combat rules
* Details of languages, currencies, and Talislantan chronology

In 1990, Bard Games published &quot;Talislanta Worldbook&quot;, a 183-page atlas of the world of Archaeus and the continent of Talislanta. Shortly after publication, Bard Games went out of business.

=== 3rd edition (Wizards of the Coast) ===
In 1992, Wizards of the Coast (WotC) — at the time a new, small, and relatively unknown company — acquired the license to &quot;Talislanta&quot; Original designer Stephen Michael Sechi collaborated with Jonathan Tweet to produce the third edition rules that included:
* &quot;The Talislanta Guidebook&quot; (1992). In the 344-page softcover book the history of Talislanta was moved forward by twenty years, and the magic system was completely revised.
* &quot;Talislanta Geographica&quot; (1992) was a 16-page softcover book containing a referee&#x27;s screen, a poster map of the continent of Talislanta, and various types of geographical information, including wind and water currents, major conflicts, and four adventure outlines. The map text was written by Peter Adkison and George Lowe, and the adventures were written by Jeff Goldman and George Lowe.
* &quot;The Archaen Codex&quot; (1992), a 180-page softcover book by Stephen Michael Sechi, was an update on variant magic rules, including spells, skills, magic items and books. 
* &quot;Thystram&#x27;s Collectanea&quot; (1993), a 150-page softcover book by Stephen Michael Sechi, was an updated bestiary, containing details of all known flora and fauna.
* &quot;The Scent of the Beast&quot; (1992), by Jonathan Tweet, the first full-length Talislanta adventure
* &quot;Quantrigue&quot; (1993), by Stephen Michael Sechi and Tony Herring, another full length adventure 
* &quot;Sarista&quot; (1994), a 72-page book by Mike McDonald and Peter Adkison about the nomadic people known as the Sarista.

WotC&#x27;s final &quot;Talislanta&quot; book was the full-length campaign &quot;Sub-Men Rising&quot; (1994) by Robin Laws. In an announcement printed on the last page, WotC announced that this would be &quot;the last &quot;Talislanta&quot; book from Wizards of the Coast&quot;; &quot;Talislanta&quot; products would now be published by Daedalus Entertainment, a small Canadian company that had produced the game &quot;Feng Shui&quot;. However, Daedalus went out of business before its version was published.

===10th anniversary edition (Pharos Press)===
In 1997, Pharos Press acquired the license to &quot;Talislanta&quot; in order to produce a new edition of the game in time for the tenth anniversary of &quot;Talislanta&quot;. Pharos had an ambitious plan to expand and revise all previously published material, then combine it one book. Plagued by production delays, Pharos got as far as producing a few ashcans, but failed to publish a product by the end of the year. Because they had missed the tenth anniversary, trademark holder Stephen Michael Sechi rescinded their license.

===4th edition (Shooting Iron and Morrigan Press)===
A small company called Shooting Iron acquired the license and in 2001 produced &quot;Talislanta Fantasy Role-playing&quot;, a 502-page 4th edition that was largely based on the never-published Pharos Press 10th anniversary edition. Shooting Iron also published the supplement &quot;Midnight Realm&quot; in 2005, a 152-page book detailing the plane of existence known as The Darkness, but then relinquished the license.

Morrigan Press acquired the license to &quot;Talislanta&quot; and published the following supplements under Shooting Iron&#x27;s 4th edition rules:
* &quot;Talislanta Menagerie&quot; (2005), an updated bestiary
* &quot;Codex Magicus&quot; (2005), an updated magic system
* &quot;The Northern Reaches&quot; (2005), an exploration of the arctic regions of Talislanta
* &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; (2005), a 64-page adventure
* &quot;The Chronicles of Talislanta&quot; (2005), a revised and updated version of the book originally published under 1st edition rules in 1987
* &quot;The Darkness&quot; (2005), a revised edition of Shooting Iron&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Realm&quot;
* &quot;Talislanta Cardstock Minis&quot; (2005), 13 pages of illustrations of popular character types that could be cut out and used as miniatures 
* &quot;People &amp; Places: Djaffa&quot; (2006), details of the nomadic desert tribes known as the Djaffa.
* &quot;Riding the Sky&quot; (2006), a book about windsailors

===d20 edition===
In 2005, Morrigan Press released &quot;Talislanta d20 Edition&quot;, a new version adapted to the d20 System.

===5th edition (Morrigan Press)===
In 2006, Morrigan Press announced the upcoming release of a fifth edition that revised the magic system slightly and provided a variant character generation system. Over the next year, four books were released:
* &quot;Hotan&#x27;s History of the World&quot; (2006), a revised and expanded overview of the geography, peoples and major urban centers of Talislanta.
* &quot;The Menagerie&quot; (2007), an updated bestiary that includes all creatures from previous editions.
* &quot;A Player&#x27;s Guide to Talislanta&quot; (2007) includes the new 5th edition rules for combat, magic, character generation.
* &quot;A Gamemaster&#x27;s Guide to Talislanta&quot;(2007) includes new rule variants, new races, and new magic orders.

In 2008, Morrigan Press went out of business.

=== Talislanta: The Savage Land ===
Launched in a successful Kickstarter campaign by Nocturnal Media in 2017, &quot;Talislanta: The Savage Land&quot; was released starting in 2018 to backers and 2019 for the rest of the world. Instead of taking place in the classic game&#x27;s time, this prequel game takes place shortly after The Great Disaster, referred by the Savage Land denizens as &quot;The Fall&quot;. Three rule versions of the game were completed and released: one based on the classic &quot;Talislanta&quot; rules, one released under the 5th Edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; OGL, and one using the OpenD6 system. The setting is low-magic due to the loss of magical knowledge and the survivors&#x27; prejudice against magic.

=== Epic Edition (Everything Epic) ===
In 2023, Everything Epic launched a Crowdfunding Campaign on Gamefound.com to fund an all new edition of Talislanta known as the &quot;Epic Edition&quot;, also known as the 6th and Final Edition written by Steven Michael Sechi and Christopher Batarlis. This edition is the ultimate version of the game, curated by Sechi to include the &quot;Best of Talislanta&quot; throughout its history. With all new Color Artwork, Never-Before-Seen characters, lore, over 100 Player Character Archetypes, over 100 Monsters in the Bestiary, and a 400 + page Atlas, this version of Talislanta will include the entire final vision the original creator Sechi had for the universe. Including four brand new books:

* &quot;The Talislanta Core Book (Player&#x27;s Guide):&quot; Includes the full rules of play for Talislanta as well as Player Character Archetypes, Items, Skills, Spells, and everything needed to play the game. All archetypes have upgraded stats and full color artwork. 
* &quot;The Bestiary of Talislanta:&quot; Includes hundreds of monsters curated to be the most important for the world with updated stats and full color artwork. 
* &quot;The Atlas of Talislanta:&quot; In an over four hundred page tome, this book includes all of the most important locations of Talislanta as well as a great deal of important lore, random encounter tables, and other useful items for the Gamemaster to use in their games. 
* &quot;The Fifth Edition Conversion Book:&quot; Originally meant to be a part of the Core Book above, after the &quot;OGL Conversion to Creative Commons in 2023&quot;, this book was removed from the core book and bestiary to create its own book. This book includes all of the Archetypes and all of the Monsters from the bestiary to create a book that will include everything needed to use Talislanta&#x27;s unique characters in a &quot;5e&quot; rules system and play in the world of Talislanta.

This edition is in development and is tentatively set to release to backers in November 2023 and to the rest of the world in December 2023.

===Translations===
Talislanta has been translated into several languages, including Italian (1997), German (1991–1992) and French (2005–present). The French edition, published by Ludopathes Éditeurs, is based on the 4th edition rules by Shooting Iron, and has resulted in seven books and seven PDFs.

==Reception==
Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Talislanta&quot; for &quot;White Wolf&quot; #11, rating it 9 out of 10 overall, and stated that &quot;The true strength of Talislanta is its uniqueness. Here is a fantasy world without orcs and goblins and all those &quot;standard&quot; enemies [...] I highly recommend this world as a place where your imagination can run wild.&quot;

In the March 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #143), Jim Bambra called Talislanta &quot;something out of the ordinary&quot;. Bambra found the art &quot;visually appealing, and does an excellent job of conveying the atmosphere, places, and peoples of Talislanta. A flick through any of the four books reveals that Talislanta is special.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Some may find the Talislantan game system thin on rules and mechanics, but it does an admirable job of handling all kinds of tests without interrupting the flow of the game. With only a few rules to learn, you can concentrate on role-playing rather than rule-playing.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, Rick Swan called the 1st edition &quot;entertainingly written ... a model of clarity and elegance.&quot; Swan enjoyed the character creation system, noting that &quot;Distinctive, enthralling characters can be created in a matter of minutes — it&#x27;s an inspired system, one of the best of any fantasy RPG.&quot; The only flaw Swan found was a &quot;lack of structure&quot;, wishing that more examples of play could have been given. Swan concluded by giving the game an excellent rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;For the adventurous, &quot;Talislanta&quot; is a role-playing nirvana.&quot;

Mark A. Santillo reviewed &quot;Talislanta Complete Roleplaying Game&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #33 (Sept./Oct., 1992), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;The overall rating is high because of the tremendous creative effort that went into Talislanta, effort which is evident in the excellent artwork, imaginative archetypes, geographical features and fanciful beasts. Also, the system is truly easy to learn and use for both GM and players and places emphasis on role-playing and not numbers-crunching.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath called the game &quot;a land of many regions, each unique in character. Some might call this tonal inconsistency, and that is true, to a degree, but the result is so varied and strange a world that it is easy to forgive its silly bits. How can a player be upset with a game that offers 84 types of characters right out of the gate?&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;&quot;Talislanta&quot; is neither tidy nor gestalt. It never feels entirely cogent, and the tone is all over the place. What &quot;Talislanta&quot; is, though, is fresh, even 30-years later. The world jumps off the page.&quot;

<doc id="1005009" wikidata="Q1031340" url="?curid=1005009" title="Mark Linkous">
<text>Frederick Mark Linkous (September 9, 1962 – March 6, 2010) was an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as leader of Sparklehorse. He was also known for his collaborations with such artists as Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, Daniel Johnston, Cracker, Radiohead, Black Francis, Julian Casablancas, Nina Persson, David Lynch, Fennesz, Danger Mouse, and Sage Francis.

A member of the 1980s indie band the Dancing Hoods, Linkous moved with the group from his native Virginia to New York City and later Los Angeles in hopes of achieving mainstream success. By 1988, the band had failed to land a major record label deal, and it disbanded, with Linkous returning to Virginia, where he began writing songs under various monikers.

By 1995, he created a project named Sparklehorse, of which he remained the only permanent member. The band released a quartet of critically acclaimed albums: on Capitol Records, &quot;Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Spider&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;; and on Astralwerks records, &quot;Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain&quot;. Linkous lived the last years of his life in Hayesville, North Carolina, where he established Static King Studio. He died by suicide in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 6, 2010.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Frederick Mark Linkous was born on September 9, 1962, in Arlington, Virginia, to Gloria Hughes Thacker and Frederick Linkous. He had three brothers. Many members of his family were coal miners by trade, and Linkous chose a career in music in part to avoid working in mines. His parents divorced before he was 13.

He later characterized himself during his teenage years as a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot;, and began hanging out in a motorcycle gang at a young age. During his adolescence, he was sent to live with his paternal grandparents in Charlottesville, Virginia. Linkous also attended Albemarle High School in Charlottesville, where he &quot;went to school to see my friends—that&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t drop out.&quot; During his high school years, he began abusing alcohol and consuming marijuana heavily.

===Dancing Hoods===
Shortly after graduating from high school in the early 1980s, Linkous moved to New York City, where he co-founded the band Dancing Hoods. It featured Linkous on guitar and vocals, Bob Bortnick on vocals and guitar, Don Short on drums, and Eric Williams on bass. In 1984, the group released a self-titled EP; a year later, it released the album &quot;12 Jealous Roses&quot; on Relativity Records, which received a number of positive reviews. The Replacements and The Del Fuegos were also vocal fans of the band after the release of its first record.

In 1988, Dancing Hoods put out its second album, &quot;Hallelujah Anyway&quot;, on Combat Records. A single from the album, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Got Rockets&quot;, was a modest college radio hit, and its video was picked up by MTV&#x27;s program&quot;120 Minutes&quot;. The same year, the group relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of achieving mainstream success, but broke up shortly after.

=== Salt Chunk Mary ===
Following the breakup of Dancing Hoods, Linkous moved back to Virginia. There, before he started the Sparklehorse project, he had another band consisting of Frederick Mark Linkous, Matt Linkous, Chip Jones, and Steve Schick. Formed in late 1989 as The Johnson Family, it soon became Salt Chunk Mary—both names being characters in Jack Black&#x27;s memoir &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win.&quot; Demos were circulated, but no official releases were made. By 1995, Mark Linkous formed the solo project Sparklehorse, taking a couple of Salt Chunk Mary songs with him, and Matt Linkous later formed The Rabbit with Melissa Moore.

===Sparklehorse===
After Dancing Hoods broke up, Linkous moved back to Virginia, where he continued writing songs. One of the tracks he wrote during this period with David Lowery, &quot;Sick of Goodbyes&quot;, was recorded by Cracker and appeared on its 1993 album &quot;Kerosene Hat&quot;. While in Virginia, he performed concerts under the monikers The Johnson Family (with members of Richmond punk legends Honor Role) and Salt Chunk Mary. Linkous finally settled on the band name Sparklehorse, and released &quot;Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot&quot; on Capitol Records in 1995. He remained the only consistent member throughout the band&#x27;s existence.

In 1996, while supporting Radiohead on the first Sparklehorse tour, Linkous overdosed on alcohol, Valium, antidepressants, and possibly other substances in his London hotel room. Rendered unconscious, he collapsed with his legs pinned beneath him, and remained in that position for almost 14 hours. He was treated at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. Subsequent surgeries saved both legs, but he required the use of a wheelchair for six months. His legs never regained their original strength.

1998 saw the release of &quot;Good Morning Spider&quot;; one of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;St. Mary&quot;, dealt with Linkous&#x27;s accident in London and subsequent rehabilitation. In 2001, Sparklehorse released &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, which featured contributions from Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, John Parish, Nina Persson, Vic Chesnutt, and Dave Fridmann.

In 2003, Sparklehorse&#x27;s song &quot;Sea of Teeth&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;, a film starring Zooey Deschanel and directed by David Gordon Green.

In September 2006, Sparklehorse released &quot;Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain&quot;. The album marked a new collaboration with DJ Danger Mouse.

In 2009, Linkous teamed up with electronic ambient artist Christian Fennesz to create &quot;In the Fishtank 15&quot;, an experimental EP. The last four live shows Linkous did with Fennesz were during a European tour in October 2009.

At the time of his death, his manager confirmed that Linkous &quot;had completed most of the work for a new Sparklehorse album&quot;, was in the process of moving to Knoxville, Tennessee, and was working on setting up a studio where he planned to finish the record.

===&quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;===
In the late 2000s, Linkous recorded the album &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; with the producer Danger Mouse, the director David Lynch, and ten other musicians. It was released on the Internet in May 2009, as was a book of photographs by Lynch to accompany the music. Though long delayed due to legal problems, it was officially released in 2010 several months after Linkous&#x27;s death. The album features several guest singers and writers, such as The Flaming Lips and Iggy Pop. Vic Chesnutt, another guest on the album, died by suicide a few months before Linkous. Because of this, the album is dedicated &quot;in memory of Mark Linkous and Vic Chesnutt&quot;.

===Production and other work===
Aside from his own music, Linkous became a sought-after record producer, and helmed works such as Nina Persson&#x27;s solo record, &quot;A Camp&quot;; the track &quot;Silverlake&quot; by Azure Ray (feat. Sparklehorse), the first recording by Azure Ray after its six-year hiatus ended in 2009, later rerecorded and released by Saddle Creek Records after Linkous&#x27;s death along with the demo he created; and Daniel Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Fear Yourself&quot;. Linkous was one of Johnston&#x27;s most ardent supporters. Johnston was an outsider artist who had a long battle with mental illness. In 2004, Linkous curated and produced &quot;The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered&quot;, a tribute album featuring acts such as Beck, Death Cab for Cutie, Vic Chesnutt, Tom Waits and Bright Eyes, and a collaboration between Sparklehorse and The Flaming Lips on the track &quot;Go.&quot;

He collaborated with Bangles singer-songwriter Susanna Hoffs on several tracks for an unrealized solo album in 1993-1994, cowriting and contributing songs and playing on tracks including a cover of Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Go.&quot; Linkous also provided music for rapper Sage Francis&#x27;s album &quot;Li(f)e&quot; and the song &quot;Love The Lie.&quot; The album and song were released after Linkous&#x27;s death.

==Death==
In March 2010, Linkous was about to move into a spare bedroom in the Knoxville home of bandmate Scott Minor; Linkous was apparently in the process of breaking up with his wife of 19 years, Teresa. Linkous battled depression for many years and was greatly shaken by the December 2009 suicide of his close friend Vic Chesnutt.

In the early afternoon of March 6, 2010, Linkous was drinking Kentucky bourbon with Minor and friend DeWitt Burton at their home. After receiving a number of text messages on his BlackBerry that left him distraught, he told Minor and Burton, &quot;It&#x27;s not good.&quot; Linkous quietly retrieved his ITM Arms rifle from an upstairs room, then told his two friends that he was going for a walk and left through a back door. At about 1:15pm, a witness saw him sit down in the alley near Irwin Street, aim the rifle at his own heart, and pull the trigger. Linkous was declared dead at the scene; he was 47 years old.

Police did not find a suicide note. Linkous&#x27;s publicist confirmed the details of his death to a number of publications that day. According to his toxicology report, his blood alcohol content was 0.43 at the time of his death; benzodiazepines and antidepressants were also found in his system.

Teresa Linkous died six years later, on March 5, 2016, from an acute asthma attack.

===Reaction===
Within a few hours of his death, a message attributed to the Linkous family was posted on the official Sparklehorse website: &quot;It is with great sadness that we share the news that our dear friend and family member Mark Linkous took his own life today. We are thankful for his time with us and will hold him forever in our hearts. May his journey be peaceful, happy, and free. There&#x27;s a heaven and there&#x27;s a star for you.&quot; 

A number of notable musicians and people in the music world made statements mourning the loss of Linkous, including Patti Smith, Radiohead&#x27;s Colin Greenwood, Silversun Pickups&#x27; Brian Aubert, Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s Chris Walla, Steven Drozd and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, Steve Albini, Gemma Hayes, and the Jesus Lizard&#x27;s David Wm. Sims. Emily Haines of Metric wrote a eulogy titled &quot;The Rings of Saturn on Your Fingers&quot;. 

The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; published an appreciation of his work alongside a discussion of his depression and his relationship to other musical artists.

<text>The Losers released on video as Nam&#x27;s Angels is a 1970 American biker war film directed by Jack Starrett.

==Plot==
The plot involves a gang of Hells Angels-type bikers called &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocates&quot; involved in the Vietnam War. They are sent to the Cambodian jungle on Yamaha bikes in order to rescue an American diplomat/CIA Agent, Chet Davis.

The biker gang is led by Link Thomas, a Vietnam veteran and the brother of an Army Major who has recruited them. His gang consists of Duke, also a Vietnam veteran, Limpy, Speed, and another Vietnam veteran, Dirty Denny. They are under the orders of Army Captain Jackson.

The gang modifies their motorcycles in a garage run by Diem-Nuc. They weld armor plating with submachine guns on the handlebars. Limpy drives a three-wheeler modified from a Harley-Davidson frame with a Volkswagen rear end, that is armed with heavy .50 caliber machine guns and a multiple rocket launcher from a helicopter. In order to open fire on enemy soldiers in trees or towers the gang do wheelies whilst firing their weapons.

==Cast==
*William Smith as Link Thomas
*Bernie Hamilton as Captain Jackson
*Huston Savage as Dirty Denny
*Adam Roarke as Duke
*Paul Koslo as Limpy
*Gene Cornelius as Speed
*John Garwood as Sergeant Winston
*Ana Korita as Kim Sue
*Vic Diaz as Diem-Nuc
*Alan Caillou as Albanian

==Production==
On November 19, 1965, Sonny Barger the &quot;Maximum Leader&quot; of the Hells Angels motorcycle club sent a telegram to President Johnson offering the Angels as &quot;gorilla fighters&quot; (sic) in the Vietnam War. Though the President turned them down, the idea became a Vietnam War movie made in the Philippines using sets and crew from &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;.

William Smith stated that the original ending had the rescued diplomat die whilst the gang lived, but Jack Starrett and Smith rewrote Alan Caillou&#x27;s screenplay. Smith also stated that the earring he wore in the film was given to him by the Hells Angels during another motorcycle film he made.

Paul Koslo was taught to ride by the film&#x27;s stuntman Gary McLarty.

Originally titled &quot;Nam&#x27;s Angels&quot;, the title was changed before release to the more generic &quot;The Losers&quot; with composer Stu Phillips writing a song incorporating the title.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocates&quot; gang also appears in the films &quot;Run, Angel, Run!&quot; and &quot;Werewolves on Wheels&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A glimpse of the movie appears in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, which Fabienne was watching, then had said &quot;A motorcycle movie; I&#x27;m not sure the name.

John Milius said this film was a &quot;big inspiration for &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Oquirrh Mountains ( ) is a mountain range that runs north–south for approximately 30 miles (50 km) to form the west side of Utah&#x27;s Salt Lake Valley, separating it from Tooele Valley. The range runs from northwestern Utah County–central &amp; eastern Tooele County, to the south shore of the Great Salt Lake. The highest elevation is Flat Top Mountain at 10,620 ft (3,237 m). The name Oquirrh was taken from the Goshute word meaning &quot;wood sitting.&quot;

The Oquirrh Mountains have been mined for gold, silver, lead, and most famously for copper, as home of the porphyry copper deposit at Bingham Canyon Mine, one of the world&#x27;s largest open pit mines. As seen from Salt Lake City, the view of the mountain range is dominated by the displaced rock material (known as overburden) dug from the Kennecott mine. At the north end of the range is Kennecott&#x27;s smelter complex, which refines ore concentrates from the mine into useful metals. Dark-colored tailings from past metal refining at the complex can be observed from the adjacent freeway, I-80. The value of the minerals taken from the range has been estimated to far exceed the combined value of those taken in the California, Nevada, and Klondike gold and silver rushes.

In the winter months, the mountains become home to a small population of bald eagles, which can often be found in the cliffs on the west side of the range down to the reservoir near the town of Stockton.

The range has many canyons and dense forests, consisting mainly of conifers and aspen. The area is also home to thriving populations of butterflies, deer, mountain lions, and squirrels. Two of the most popular canyons are Yellow Fork Canyon and Butterfield Canyon. Yellow Fork Canyon is home to a trail administered by Salt Lake County and numerous gated communities. Butterfield Canyon contains a paved road (with the exception of a 1/4 mile portion on the Tooele side that is well-maintained dirt) that connects Tooele with Herriman. Butterfield Canyon road climbs to a summit of 9,180 ft. above sea level. At night the mouth of the canyon is a dangerous area as large herds of deer move into the farmlands for feeding.

The north end of the mountain range features a peak known as Farnsworth Peak which houses almost all Salt Lake City FM and TV station transmitters. The peak is also used for emergency communications (such as police, fire, and EMS). Several local businesses and amateur radio operators have transmitters on Farnsworth Peak.

<doc id="1005018" wikidata="Q4752840" url="?curid=1005018" title="Fife and drum corps">
<text>A fife and drum corps is a musical ensemble consisting of fifes and drums. In the United States of America, fife and drum corps specializing in colonial period impressions using fifes, rope tension snare drums and rope tension bass drums are known as Ancient Fife and Drum Corps.
Many of these ensembles originated from a type of military field music.

== History ==

Fifes are an ancient wind instrument that have evolved over the centuries. The original form was small and bore six finger-holes, but later versions may have various sizes and numbers of holes. While ancient fifes were one-piece and therefor not easily tuned, modern fifes are two pieces connected by a joint made from either metal or cork. Modern 10-hole and 11-hole fifes are chromatic, thus able to play any note as opposed to the more limited ancient fifes, which could only be played in a few keys.

The fife originated in Europe and has spread widely beyond. It is a similar instrument to the German &quot;Schweizerpfeife&quot;, which translates to &quot;Swiss fife&quot;, the Irish flute, baroque flute and the piccolo. 

Fifes have been in use by military organizations since the 16th century. Fifes originally accompanied companies of soldiers, providing music while on the march and in camp. Drums have had a role in militaries going back farther in history. 

The rise of the modern army began in the late 16th century and evolved throughout the 18th century. Drilling to precise and increasingly complicated geometric movements in close order formation, armies adapted and trained fifers and drummers to signal preparatory alerts and execution signals as well as times of day for the troops. It became customary for each company of 100 or so men to be assigned 2 fifers and 2 drummers to sound signals, hours and alarms, as well as play popular music on the march. This pattern was also practised in the U.S. services from the Revolutionary War up until the late 19th Century. When the companies of a Regiment or Battalion were gathered together, it was customary to assemble the fifes and drums from all the companies into a &#x27;band&#x27; to march at the head of the column on parade. When a regimental military band (woodwinds and brass) were also present, the fifes and drums marched at the head, followed by the military band. This is still the custom with British Regimental bands. To this day, the drum major&#x27;s preparatory command to move a British Army band is, &quot;Band and Drums...&quot;. This is referring back to the segregation of the fifes and drums as a separate entity from a military band.

Fifes have always been an infantry musical instrument. Assigned at the company level with 1-2 fifes and 1-2 drums per company (or formed as a band at the regimental level), fifes and drums were used to regulate the daily activities of the troops. They signaled when the troops should rise in the morning and retire at night, when to eat, when to assemble, and to sound an alarm. The infantry used side drums (snare/field, long drum/tenor drum and the bass drum). When detached to the companies, the drummers used only the side drums. Cavalry and Dragoon (mounted infantry) units did not use them, instead utilizing bugles to signal commands. The only remaining Fife and Drum Corps in the American Military is the Fife and Drum Corps of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), a ceremonial Army unit based out of Ft. Myer, Virginia, raised in 1960.

The Colonial Williamsburg Fifes and Drums, founded in 1958 by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, is a professional corps made up of young musicians between the ages of 10 and 18. They are a fine representation of what a fife and drum corps would have looked and sounded like during the mid-eighteenth century when company fifers and drummers came together as a single unit for marches, trooping of the colors, and parades. The Colonial Williamsburg Fifes and Drums depict the Virginia State Garrison Regiment, which served in the Tidewater area of Virginia shortly after the American Revolution.

Modern non-military Fife and Drum Corps are organizations with volunteer or paid performers. Revenue is obtained through fundraising and by performing in town and city parades. Corps performance pieces often reflect the expectations of the audience for these venues (e.g., patriotic and Irish medleys for Memorial Day and St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, respectively). Sometimes a Fire Department may have their own associated Fife and Drum Corps to march ahead of their fire trucks. Other corps may obtain revenue from reenactment performances. Several times per year various Fife and Drum Corps meet to compete, parade, socialize, and muster at a camp ground or meeting hall (in the winter).

The Marine Corps of the Royal Netherlands Navy employs a Fife and Drum Corps tracing back its roots to 1665 and possibly earlier. In Dutch, the &quot;Tamboers en Pijpers&quot; are made up of fully trained professional Dutch Marines who play the drums (&quot;Tamboer&quot;) or fife (&quot;Pijper&quot;, derived from &quot;Pfeife&quot;, cognate of Fife). Both categories are fully accomplished as Buglers for Dutch military ceremonial tasks.

==Instrumentation==
A fife is a woodwind instrument in the transverse flute family, which sounds an octave above the written music and has 6 tone holes (some have 10 or 11 tone holes for added chromatics). Most fifes are wood - blackwood, grenadilla, rosewood, mopane, pink-ivory and other dense woods are superior; maple and persimmon are inferior, but often used, particularly as entry-level instruments. Some corps have used metal fifes. In Civil War corps, bugles are sometimes part of the instrumentation.

Rope-tension snare and bass drums are tightened using tugs or ears that apply pressure to the rope, which is transferred to the heads when the rope compresses the counter hoops, causing them to move slightly closer together. The drum heads used are usually made of lamb or calf skin, or plastic drum heads made by many drum manufacturers. Unlike in the British corps, the single tenor drum is not customarily used in American fife and drum ensembles, although only a few ensembles that play the fife and bugle have them and these were paired in the 1880s in the US Armed Forces with fifes and bugles when these were introduced before the fifes were abandoned.

==Performance==

The drums are beaten using two sticks. Visual effects may be created by &quot;flourishes&quot; of the drum sticks; for example, bass drummers may swing the beaters in a flourish while the snare drummers roll (or when the beating leaves sufficient time to flourish).

Songs are chosen based on a number of criteria, and can include both historically significant music and new pieces specifically composed or arranged to be played on fife and drum.

Most fife and drum corps march in parades, perform at concerts, in festivals and state fairs, and expositions. Some fife and drum corps focus on interpreting a specific time period and portray field musicians of the era at living history events and reenactments. Many corps perform together at musters, particularly in the North-East, but also nationally throughout the United States.

The typical uniform of the Ancient Fife and Drum Corps is a representation of some military uniform from the American Revolutionary War. Uniforms often consist of tricorns or cocked hats, waistcoats, knickers (knee breeches) or gaitered trousers, ruffled cuffs, neck stocks, and buckled shoes similar those by the Continental Army or Marines. Only a few wear uniforms of the War of 1812, including shakos. More recently, American Civil War uniforms have risen in prominence, with uniforms and instrumentation based on Civil War units of either the Union or Confederate armies. Headdress worn by these is either the kepi or Forage cap.

<doc id="1005027" wikidata="Q463986" url="?curid=1005027" title="Lesotho Fatse La Bontata Rona">
<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Lesotho. The lyrics were written by French missionary François Coillard and Swiss missionary Adolphe Mabille, and the music is taken from an 1820 hymnal composed by Swiss composer Ferdinand Samuel Laur. It was officially adopted as the national anthem in 1967. The original composition that the national anthem was based on had five verses, though only the first and last ended up being adopted.

==History==
The song was written by French missionaries François Coillard and Adolphe Mabille and set to the tune of the 1820 hymnal &quot;Freiheit&quot; () by Swiss composer Ferdinand-Samuel Laur. It was introduced around 1869 as part of a collection of hymns and work songs. This was immediately after the third and final Free State–Basotho War (1867–1868), and the lyrics encouraged the Basotho to accept the borders defined in the 1869 Convention of Aliwal North between Britain and the Boer Free State, which ended the war.

The song is first known to have been performed at a party work party for Basotho chief Molapo in 1870. Originally sung by field workers, by the 1900s, mission schools run by the Paris Evangelical Mission Society had begun teaching the song to their students. Over time, the song became abbreviated, and only the first and fifth (last) verses began to be taught. The missionaries also organised public performances of the song by their students on special occasions.

The song gained de facto use in important functions in the early 20th century, commonly being sung after &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and was already being referred to as the national anthem by the 1940s. A version including the first and last verses, shortened by choral composer Joshua Pulumo Mohapeloa, was declared the official anthem of Lesotho on 1 June 1967, just over a year after independence on 4 October 1966.

<doc id="1005029" wikidata="Q541166" url="?curid=1005029" title="Richmond Lock and Footbridge">
<text>Richmond Lock and Footbridge is a lock, rising and falling low-tide barrage integrating controlled sluices and pair of pedestrian bridges on the River Thames in southwest London, England, and is a Grade II* listed structure. It is the furthest downstream of the forty-five Thames locks and the only one owned and operated by the Port of London Authority. It was opened in 1894 and is north-west of the centre of Richmond in a semi-urban part of southwest London. Downstream are Syon Park and Kew Gardens on opposite banks. It connects the promenade at Richmond with the neighbouring district of St. Margarets on the west bank during the day and is closed at night to pedestrians – after 19:30 GMT or after 21:30 when BST is in use. At high tide the sluice gates are raised and partly hidden behind metal arches forming twin footbridges.

It was built to maintain the lowest-lying head of water of the forty-five navigable reaches of the Thames above the rest of the Tideway. Below the structure for a few miles, at low tide, the navigable channel is narrow and restricts access for vessels with the greatest draft. The next major point of mooring below the lock is, accordingly, at Brentford Dock.

==Description==
The chief engineer who designed the core of the structure, F.G.M. Stoney, took out seven patents relating to sluices between 1873 and 1894. Hunt and Steward, surveyors, designed the lockhouses. Ransomes &amp; Rapier of Ipswich designed the ironwork including the arches. The structure was built between 1891 and 1894.

;The structures
The superstructure was built horizontally in three sections, the middle section forms the bulk and has, itself, three spans.

The lock is the first section, topped by the first of five ornate metal arches which spread over the other sections. The middle section has mechanically rising-to-parapet-height sluice gates forming sheets of metals above and close to the water line which is created by these structures when lowered. The final section is a set of two facing ramps in part with canoe/boat rollers.

;Purpose
The lock and barrages were installed in 1894 by the Thames Conservancy to maintain a broad navigable depth of water upstream of Richmond. The rising barrage ensures upstream at least of water is in the standard navigation channel (away from banks) to the next lock, Teddington, and an annual draw-off (an all-tides lifting of the sluice gates) takes place to enable dredging to keep the advertised minimum channel depth.

===Ownership and operation===
In 1908 an act transferred responsibility for all points of the river downstream of a point below Teddington Lock to the Port of London Authority thereby including this structure.

===Reasons for construction===

When the London Bridge of 1209 to 1831 was demolished the removal of its bulky and elaborate piers resulted in the tides upstream returning to the rapid flows as they were downstream and before its forming of a near-barrier. That bridge was particularly dam-like when it housed 200 buildings in the Tudor period and in depictions at the time of the Great Fire of London which spared the bridge. This change, together with dredging of the lower river (lowest reaches) and construction of Teddington Lock and weir, meant that for hours of each day the Thames at Richmond, Twickenham, Ham, Petersham and northern Teddington, was a shallow watercourse running past great mud and shingle banks. The exception was after weeks of above-average rainfall when the river is known as &quot;in spate&quot; however such outflow hinders navigation upstream. By the late 19th century water extraction above Teddington had increased to four of five of the city&#x27;s main waterworks and after light or normal rainfall more barges found it impossible to navigate the reach during and for hours around the two low tides each day. In 1890, after many years of petitioning, an act of Parliament was enacted to build the half-lock and weir, the Richmond Footbridge Sluices, Lock and Slipway Act 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. ccxxiv). This is among a small minority of Thames locks not to have been built around an island or islands (aits).

===Details of design===

A barge lock was constructed against the north-east (&quot;Surrey&quot;) side. This is followed by four immense brick piers protected by large ashlar stone cutwaters (starlings). These in turn support relatively thin stone dressings reaching to the metal parapet level, carved in a classical style with reredos and cornices, supporting painted metal arches. A matching-colour balustrade is above the arches finished with black lanterns, metal pillars and simple finials. The piers house the barriers and the arches support a pair of horizontal decks (walkways). Against the opposite bank is a gently elevated slipway accessed from upstream and downstream parts of the river. As a superstructure was required to hold the suspended barriers, authorities agreed to build this in the form of two footbridges.
The bridge was formally opened on 19 May 1894 by the then Duke of York (who later became King George V), having cost £61,000 ().

Richmond Lock is a half-tide lock and (half-tide) barrage which incorporates a public footbridge. The footbridge crosses the conventional lock, the barrages and the slipway, which comprises three vertical steel sluice gates suspended from the footbridge structure. Each sluice gate weighs 32 tons, is in width and in depth. The lock permits passage of vessels up to long by 26 feet 8 inches wide.

For about two hours each side of the published time of high tide the three sluice gates are raised into the footbridge supports above, and river traffic can pass through the barrage unimpeded. For the rest of the tidal cycle sluice gates are lowered – ships and boats must use the lock alongside the barrage at a cost of . Rowing boats and kayaks can use the roller solid slipways which reach an apex above the height of the barrages. The maximum fall of the lock is .

==Historic operation==
The sluice gates were manually operated by lock keepers, who lived in housing mostly contained under the pedestrian steps and landing on both banks.

From the date of the bridge&#x27;s opening until some time during World War II, pedestrians were charged a toll of one (old) penny, i.e. of a pound. However, sightseers who went onto the bridge and left from the same side had to pay tuppence (two old pence, of a pound). The toll booths and the remains of the turnstile housings remain. Since two unconnected footbridges exist, one either side of the sluice-gate-holding brickwork and mechanisms, four toll booths and turnstiles had to be provided to collect the tolls.

<text>The Bozo () are a Mande ethnic group located predominantly along the Niger River in Mali. The name &quot;Bozo&quot; is thought to derive from Bambara &quot;bɔ-so&quot; &quot;bamboo house&quot;; the people accept it as referring to the whole of the ethnic group but use more specific clan names such as &quot;Sorogoye&quot;, &quot;Hain&quot;, and &quot;Tieye&quot; themselves. They are famous for their fishing and are occasionally referred to as the &quot;masters of the river&quot;.

The Bozo language, which belongs to the Soninke-Bozo subgroup of Northwestern Mande, have traditionally been considered dialects of one language though there are at least four distinct varieties.

Aspects of Bozo culture took shape under the 10th century Ghana Empire, when the Bozo took possession of the banks of the Niger. The Bozo were the founders of the Malian cities of Djenné and Mopti.

Though the Bozo are predominantly Muslim, they preserve a number of animist traditions as well. Their animal totem is the bull, whose body represents the Niger and whose horns represent the Bozo fishing pirogues.

A 2000 census counted the Bozo population of Mali to be 132,100.

<doc id="1005041" wikidata="Q2160191" url="?curid=1005041" title="Hélène Jégado">
<text>Hélène Jégado (c. 1803 – 26 February 1852) was a French domestic servant and serial killer. She is believed to have murdered as many as 36 people with arsenic over a period of 18 years. After an initial period of activity, between 1833 and 1841, she seems to have stopped for nearly ten years before a final spree in 1851.

==Early life and crimes==
Hélène Jégado was born on a small farm in Plouhinec (Morbihan), near Lorient in Brittany. She lost her mother at the age of seven and was sent to work with two aunts who were servants at the rectory of Bubry. After 17 years, she accompanied an aunt to the town of Séglien. She became a cook for the curé, where an incident arose where she was accused of adding hemp from his grain house to his soup.

Her first suspected poisoning occurred in 1833 when she was employed by another priest, Fr. François Le Drogo, in the nearby village of Guern. In the three months between 28 June and 3 October, seven members of the household died suddenly, including the priest himself, his aged mother and father, and her own visiting sister, Anne Jégado. Her apparent sorrow and pious behaviour were so convincing that she was not suspected. Coming shortly after the cholera epidemic of 1832, the deaths may have been attributed to natural causes.

Jégado returned to Bubry to replace her sister, where subsequently three people, including her other aunt, died over the course of three months, all of whom she cared for at their bedside. She relocated to Locminé, where she boarded with a needleworker, Marie-Jeanne Leboucher; both Leboucher and her daughter died and a son fell ill. It is possible that the son survived because he did not accept Jégado&#x27;s ministrations. Then, in the same town, the widow Lorey offered Jégado a room; she died after eating a soup that her new boarder had prepared. In May 1835, Jégado was hired by a Madame Toussaint; four more deaths followed. By that point in time, she had already put seventeen people in their graves.

Later in 1835, Jégado was employed as a servant in a convent in Auray, but was rapidly dismissed after several incidents of vandalism and sacrilege.

Jégado worked as a cook in other households in Auray, then in Pontivy, Lorient, and Port-Louis, although she was employed only briefly in each one. Often someone fell ill or died. Among her most infamous murders was that of a child, little Marie Bréger, who died at the Château de Soye (Ploemeur) in May 1841, ten years and one month before her final arrest. Most victims died showing symptoms corresponding to arsenic poisoning, though she was never caught with arsenic in her possession. There is no record of any suspected deaths from late 1841 to 1849, although a number of her employers later reported thefts; she was apparently a kleptomaniac and was caught stealing several times.

Her career took a new turn in 1849 when she moved to Rennes, the capital city of the region.

Although there is not much information stating why she committed these crimes, it can generally be linked to psychological issues. The psychopathology model explains that her offences can be linked to her psychological problems. It is possible that these problems erupted at a young age after her mother died. It is not uncommon for a child to develop abandoned child syndrome due to the parents passing. Jégado once stated that murdering people gave her a sense of power, which she enjoyed.

==Arrest==
In 1850, Jégado joined the household staff of Théophile Bidard, a law professor at the University of Rennes. One of his servants, Rose Tessier, fell ill and died when Jégado tended to her. In 1851, one of the other maids, Rosalie Sarrazin, fell ill as well and died. Two doctors had tried to save Sarrazin and because the symptoms were similar to those of Tessier, they convinced the relatives to permit an autopsy. Jégado aroused suspicion when she announced her innocence before she was even asked anything, and she was arrested on 1 July 1851.

Later inquiries linked her to 23 suspected deaths by poisoning between 1833 and 1841, but none of these were thoroughly investigated since they were outside the ten-year limit for prosecution and there was no scientific evidence. Local folklore has attributed to her many unexplained deaths, some of which were almost certainly due to natural causes. The most reliable estimate is that she probably committed about 36 murders.

==Trial==
Jégado&#x27;s trial began on 6 December 1851, but, due to French laws of permissible evidence and statute of limitations, she was accused only of three murders, three attempted murders and 11 thefts. At least one later case appears to have been dropped since it involved a child and police were reluctant to upset the parents by an exhumation. Jégado&#x27;s behaviour in court was erratic, changing from humble mutterings to loud pious shouting and occasional violent outbursts against her accusers. She consistently denied she even knew what arsenic was, despite evidence to the contrary. Doctors who had examined her victims had not usually noticed anything suspicious, but when the most recent victims were exhumed, they showed overwhelming evidence of arsenic and possibly antimony.

Faustino Malaguti, a chemistry professor from the University of Rennes, was called as an expert at the trial.

The defence lawyer, Magloire Dorange, made a remarkable closing speech, arguing that she needed more time than most to repent and could be spared the death penalty since she was dying of cancer anyway.

The case attracted little attention at the time, pushed off the front pages by the coup d&#x27;état in Paris.

Jégado was sentenced to death by guillotine and executed in front of a large crowd of onlookers on the Champ-de-Mars in Rennes on 26 February 1852.

<text>Albrecht Adam (16 April 1786 – 28 August 1862) was a Bavarian painter, who accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte during the 1812 Russian campaign. He was attached as an official artist to the Bavarian contingent in Bonaparte&#x27;s . Throughout the campaign he sketched, painted and depicted an important record of the campaign to Moscow. In his memoirs he described the carnage of Borodino and late into his career he was still painting battle scenes from the Napoleonic period. He became a well-known equine artist, a legacy continued by his grandson, Emil Adam.

== Life and career ==

Albrecht Adam was born in Nördlingen, then a small free state in southern Germany, to Jeremias Adam and Margaretha Thilo in 1786. His brother Heinrich Adam (1787–1862), also a painter was born the following year. Albrecht&#x27;s talent for painting became apparent at an early age as by 1800 he was painting French troops as they marched through southern Germany. Initially apprenticed as a confectioner in Nuremberg, in 1803 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Nuremberg where he was tutored in drawing by Christoph Zwinger (1764–1813). In July 1807 he moved to Munich where he learnt from the war and battle artist Johann Lorenz Rugendas II (1775–1826). and befriended fellow artists Margarethe Geiger and , who later moved with him to Vienna. In 1809 Austria attacked Napoleon&#x27;s ally Bavaria, an action that led to a short, unpleasant conflict that culminated in Austrian defeat by France and Bavaria at the Battle of Teugen-Hausen. Adam who accompanied the victorious army to Vienna produced a series of military impressions of the conflict, beginning a theme that would dominate his career. It was during his brief residency in Vienna, that he met Prince Eugene de Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy and Bonaparte&#x27;s stepson and his wife Princess Augusta of Bavaria. The young artist was asked to join Prince Eugene&#x27;s household in Milan as a Court painter. His duties included accompanying Eugene and his staff on military campaigns across Europe.

==Adam with the to Moscow==

In 1812 Adam accompanied Prince Eugene as an artist on the expedition to Russia. He was given a military officer&#x27;s rank and attached to Eugene&#x27;s Topographical Bureau, a small unit of engineers, cartographers and draughtsmen which had been established in 1801. Adam travelled with IV Corps, composed mainly of Italian troops, on the long difficult journey to Moscow. As the progressed across Europe and into Russia Adam wrote, sketched and painted. He was present at all the major actions and witnessed the triumphant march into the smouldering ruins of Moscow. There seems little doubt that Adam was depressed, by what he had witnessed. After the key Battle of Borodino he described his feelings on visiting the battlefield... &quot;The scene was one that filled me with horror. I felt paralysed and, only by calling to mind the countless other horrors I had been witness to in this frightful campaign, could I shake myself from my stupor&quot; ...
He returned early from Moscow arriving in Munich in December 1812 thus missing the painful decimation of the as it retreated from Moscow. He remained on Prince Eugene&#x27;s staff for a further three years during which time Adam produced seventy-seven colour plates depicting the aftermath of the conflict. They show devastated landscapes, battlefields strewn with corpses, bewildered civilians, battle weary soldiers and razed towns. The memoirs that accompany each plate provide a frank composition to the war that Adam witnessed.

==Post 1815 career==

In 1815, with the Napoleonic wars drawing to a close, Adam relocated permanently to Munich, where he was court painter to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, a position that allowed him to complete commissions for many prominent families in Bavaria and Austria. Albrecht Adam&#x27;s studio became a centre for aspiring artists not least his three painter sons: Benno, Eugen and Franz. Theodor Horschelt, who later became known for his paintings of the Russian Caucasian War was a frequent visitor.

In 1824, his former employer Prince Eugene died and Adam began collating the images of the Russian Campaign gathering them together under the title &quot;Voyage pittoresque et militaire.&quot; The lithographs published in Munich between 1828 and 1833, were based on the sketches he had taken during the campaign and remain of considerable historical significance. They proved a considerable commercial success and the images have been used many times since the first edition. A number of original drawings and images in oil are held by the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.

Royal patronage continued under Ludwig I with commissions including a painting of the Battle of Borodino for the Royal Munich Residenz in 1838. Adam also painted, for Maximilian von Leuchtenberg, twelve battle scenes to hang in his palace in St Petersburg.
On 18 March 1848, the Milanese rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called Five Days &quot;(Italian: Le Cinque Giornate&quot;). The Austrians were forced to withdraw from Milan whilst the insurgents sought military aid from the Kingdom of Sardinia. Austrians forces led by Field Marshall Joseph Radetzky regathered and defeated Sardinian forces at the first Battle of Custoza and again, at the Battle of Novara. Albrecht Adam painted a series of commissioned paintings that depicted the events including a rather flattering canvass showing Radetsky on a white horse (&quot;id est&quot; Napoleon) with his general staff before the fall of Milan.

In 1859 Adam followed the army of Napoleon III of France during the Italian campaign against Austria recording the action in a series of drawings and sketches. Returning to Munich he painted the Battle of Landshut 1809 (1859) and the Battle of Zorndorf 1758 (1860) for Maximilian II of Bavaria. He remained a significant military painter, often assisted by his sons, until his death in Munich on 16 August 1862. His brother Heinrich predeceased him by six months.

In around 1850 Adam is recorded as living at &quot;Sing Straße 13&quot; in Munich.

<text>Bamses Venner () was a Danish musical group that performed together from 1973 to 2011.

Bamses Venner represented Denmark in the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest with the entry &quot;Tænker altid på dig&quot; (ranked 14th in 19 countries) and received 25 points.

They also recorded &quot;Er du langsom i nat&quot; and &quot;I en lille båd der gynger&quot;.

In 1980, the band was composed of Flemming Bamse Jørgensen, lead vocals and bass (nicknamed &quot;Bamse&quot; which means &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;), Mogens Balle (piano/organ), Bjarne Green (guitar), and Arne Østergaard (drums). As of 2004, the band consisted of Jørgensen (vocals, bass), Peter Bødker (piano/organ/guitar), Frank Thøgersen (drums), Torben Fausø (keyboards) and Jes Kerstein (guitar). Bamses Venner sang in Danish.

Jørgensen died on 1 January 2011 from a cardiac arrest. The rest of the band members have decided to break up after a series of planned memorial concerts.

<doc id="1005058" wikidata="Q5686857" url="?curid=1005058" title="Hippophae">
<text>Hippophae is genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeagnaceae. They are deciduous shrubs. They are exceptionally hardy plants, able to withstand winter temperatures as low as . As &quot;Hippophae&quot; species develop an aggressive and extensive root system, they are planted to inhibit soil erosion and used in land reclamation for their nitrogen fixing properties, wildlife habitat, and soil enrichment. &quot;Hippophae&quot; berries and leaves are manufactured into various human and animal food and skincare products.

==Species and description==
The shrubs reach tall, rarely up to in central Asia. The leaf arrangement can be alternate or opposite. &quot;&#x27;Plants of the World Online&quot; includes the following species:
# &quot;Hippophae × goniocarpa&quot; is a natural hybrid of &quot;H. neurocarpa&quot; and &quot;H. sinensis&quot; which grows in mountainous regions in Nepal, Mongolia and China. 
# &quot;Hippophae gyantsensis&quot; 
# &quot;Hippophae litangensis&quot; 
# &quot;Hippophae neurocarpa&quot; 
# &quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot; : Common sea buckthorn has dense and stiff branches, and are very thorny. The leaves are a distinct pale silvery-green, lanceolate, long, and less than broad. It is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The male produces brownish flowers which produce wind-distributed pollen. The female plants produce orange berries in diameter, soft, juicy, and rich in oils. The roots distribute rapidly and extensively, providing a nonleguminous nitrogen fixation role in surrounding soils.
# &quot;Hippophae salicifolia&quot; (willow-leaved sea buckthorn) is restricted to the Himalayas, to the south of the common sea buckthorn, growing at high altitudes in dry valleys; it differs from &quot;H. rhamnoides&quot; in having broader (to ) and greener (less silvery) leaves, and yellow berries. A wild variant occurs in the same area, but at even higher altitudes in the alpine zone. It is a low shrub not growing taller than with small leaves long.
# &quot;Hippophae sinensis&quot; 
# &quot;Hippophae tibetana&quot; 
==Taxonomy and name==
&quot;Hippophae&quot; is a small genus of Elaeagnaceae having a terminal taxon with seven species recognized, as of 2002. &quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot; is a highly variable species with eight subspecies.

In ancient times, leaves and young branches from sea buckthorn were supposedly fed as a remedy to horses to support weight gain and appearance of the coat, leading to the name of the genus, &quot;Hippophae&quot; derived from the Greek &quot;hippo&quot; (horse), and &quot;phaos&quot; (shining).

==Distribution==

&quot;Hippophae rhamnoides&quot;, the common sea buckthorn, is the most widespread of the species in the genus, with the ranges of its eight subspecies extending from the Atlantic coasts of Europe across to northwestern Mongolia, northwestern China and Northern Pakistan. In western Europe, it is largely confined to sea coasts where salt spray off the sea prevents other larger plants from outcompeting it. In central Asia, it is more widespread in dry semi-desert sites where other plants cannot survive the dry conditions.

In central Europe and Asia, it also occurs as a sub-alpine shrub above the tree line in mountains, and other sunny areas such as river banks where it has been used to stabilize erosion. They are tolerant of salt in the air and soil, but demand full sunlight for good growth and do not tolerate shady conditions near larger trees. They typically grow in dry, sandy areas.

More than 90% or about of the world&#x27;s natural sea buckthorn habitat is found in China, Mongolia, Russia, and most parts of Northern Europe.

Sea buckthorn USDA hardiness zones are about 3 through 7.

In some areas it is considered invasive, due to its ability to outcompete smaller native species.

==Varieties==
During the Cold War, Russian and East German horticulturists developed new varieties with greater nutritional value, larger berries, different ripening months and branches that are easier to harvest. Over the past 20 years, experimental crops have been grown in the United States, one in Nevada and one in Arizona, and in several provinces of Canada.

==Genetics==
A study of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequence data showed that the genus can be divided into three clades:
* &quot;H. tibetana&quot;
* &quot;H. rhamnoides&quot; with the exception of &quot;H. rhamnoides&quot; ssp. &quot;gyantsensis&quot; (=&quot;H. gyantsensis&quot;)
* remaining species

A study using chloroplast sequences and morphology, however, recovered only two clades:
* &quot;H. tibetana&quot;, &quot;H. gyantsensis&quot;, &quot;H. salicifolia&quot;, &quot;H. neurocarpa&quot;
* &quot;H. rhamnoides&quot;

==Natural history==
The fruit is an important winter food resource for some birds, notably fieldfares.

Leaves are eaten by the larva of the coastal race of the ash pug moth and by larvae of other Lepidoptera, including brown-tail, dun-bar, emperor moth, mottled umber, and &quot;Coleophora elaeagnisella&quot;.

==Uses==
===Products===
Sea buckthorn berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour, and oily unless bletted (frosted to reduce the astringency) and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of sea buckthorn juice reduces sourness, enhancing its sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of malic acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.

When the berries are pressed, the resulting sea buckthorn juice separates into three layers: on top is a thick, orange cream; in the middle, a layer containing sea buckthorn&#x27;s characteristic high content of saturated and polyunsaturated fats; and the bottom layer is sediment and juice. The upper two layers contain fat sources applicable for cosmetic purposes and can be processed for skin creams and liniments, whereas the bottom layer can be used for edible products such as syrup.

Besides juice, sea buckthorn fruit can be used to make pies, jams, lotions, teas, fruit wines, and liquors. The juice or pulp has other potential applications in foods, beverages or cosmetics products such as shower gel. Fruit drinks were among the earliest sea buckthorn products developed in China. Sea buckthorn-based juice is common in Germany and Scandinavian countries. It provides a beverage rich in vitamin C and carotenoids. Sea buckthorn berries are also used to produce rich orange-coloured ice-cream, with a melon-type taste and hints of citrus.

For its troops confronting low winter temperatures (see Siachen), India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation established a factory in Leh to manufacture a multivitamin herbal beverage based on sea buckthorn juice.

The seed and pulp oils have nutritional properties that vary under different processing methods. Sea buckthorn oils are used as a source for ingredients in several commercially available cosmetic products and nutritional supplements.

===Landscape uses===
Sea buckthorn may be used as a landscaping shrub with an aggressive basal shoot system used for barrier hedges and windbreaks, and to stabilize riverbanks and steep slopes. They have value in northern climates for their landscape qualities, as the colorful berry clusters are retained through winter. Branches may be used by florists for designing ornaments.

In northwestern China, sea buckthorn shrubs have been planted on the bottoms of dry riverbeds to increase water retention of the soil, thus decreasing sediment loss. Due to increased moisture conservation of the soil and nitrogen-fixing capabilities of sea buckthorn, vegetation levels have increased in areas where sea buckthorn have been planted. Sea buckthorn was once distributed free of charge to Canadian prairie farmers by PFRA to be used in shelterbelts.

==Folk medicine and research==

Sea buckthorn has been used over centuries in traditional medicine. Although sea buckthorn fruit extracts are under preliminary research for their pharmacological effects, there is no high-quality clinical evidence for the ability of &quot;Hippophae&quot; products to lower the risk of human diseases. As of 2022, no sea buckthorn products are approved as prescription drugs by any national regulatory agency.

Berry oil from seeds or fruit pulp, either taken orally as a dietary supplement or applied topically, is believed to be a skin softener or medicine, but there is inadequate clinical evidence of its effectiveness. There have been no systematic studies of toxicity and safety for any &quot;Hippophae&quot; product.

==Organizations==
The International Seabuckthorn Association, formerly the International Center for Research and Training on Seabuckthorn (ICRTS), was formed jointly in 1988 by the China Research and Training Center on Seabuckthorn, the Seabuckthorn Office of the Yellow River Water Commission, and the Shaanxi Seabuckthorn Development Office. From 1995 to 2000, ICRTS published the research journal, &quot;Hippophae&quot;, which appears to be no longer active.

In 2005–2007, the &quot;EAN-Seabuck&quot; network between European Union states, China, Russia and New Independent States was funded by the European Commission to promote sustainable crop and consumer product development.

In Mongolia, there is an active National Association of Seabuckthorn Cultivators and Producers.

<text>Leros (), also called Lero (from the Italian language), is a Greek island and municipality in the Dodecanese in the southern Aegean Sea. It lies from Athens&#x27;s port of Piraeus, from which it can be reached by a nine-hour ferry ride or by a 45-minute flight from Athens. It is about from Turkey. Leros is part of the Kalymnos regional unit. It has a population of 7,992 (2021).

==Geography==

The municipality has an area of . The municipality includes the populated offshore island of Farmakonisi (pop. 21), as well as several uninhabited islets, including Levitha and Kinaros, and had a 2021 census population of 7,992, although this figure swells to over 15,000 during the summer peak. The island has a coastline of . It is known for its imposing medieval castle of the Knights of Saint John possibly built on a Byzantine fortress. Nearby islands are Patmos, Lipsi, Kalymnos, and the small islands of Agia Kyriaki and Farmakos. In ancient times it was considered the island of Parthenos Iokallis and linked to the Hellenistic and Roman literature on Meleager and the Meleagrides. The administrative centre and largest town is Agia Marina, with a population of 2,380 inhabitants in 2021. Other sizable towns are Lákki (pop. 2,093), Xirókampos (710), Kamára (673), and Álinda (699).

==Transportation==

The Leros Municipal Airport at Partheni connects the island multiple times a day with Athens (45 minute flight). There are also ferry connections to and from Piraeus and the other islands of the Dodecanese, including the HighSpeed Ferry, which connects directly to Mykonos during summer (4 hours). The Catamaran Dodekanisos Express connects Leros with most of the Dodecanese islands. Leros also has a range of connections to other nearby islands with airports, including Kos, Kalymnos, Rhodes and Samos, which are a short boat ride to Leros (1 – 2 hours).

==Traditional music==

Many local songs of Leros are among the most famous in the traditional (nisiotika) music of Greece, the most celebrated being &quot;Pos to Trivun to Piperi&quot;, &quot;Mes tou Aegeou ta Nisia&quot; and &quot;Proutzos&quot;. Lerikos is the name of the local dance; also noteworthy is the Issos dance. The most loved instruments in the island are tsampouna (τσαμπούνα), lyra (λύρα) and violin.
There is a special genre of music on Leros called &quot;Havas&quot; (plural:Havades). The best known havas on Leros is that of Prouzos. There are also some well known havades such as &quot;Tou Yiannouká&quot;, &quot;Tou Mpiláli&quot; aka &quot;Ároma&quot;. There are some lesser known such as &quot;Tou Nisíriou&quot;, &quot;Tou Loulourgá&quot;, &quot;Tou Yiagoúla&quot; and &quot;Tou Kantoúni&quot;. Famous musicians of Leros include:
*Aristídis Zórzou
*Nikólas Drákos
*Nikólas Zórzou
*Hatzidákis Family

==Food==
Leros is famous for its local food and sweets. Traditionally, this was due to the range of seabound trade that connected Leros to most other islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, and parts of Asia Minor and North Africa, guaranteeing fresh produce and a range of recipes and styles that made Leros cuisine unique. In more modern times, the Italian occupation led to Leros adding an Italian style to its cuisine, whereby now many restaurants in Leros provide a unique mix of Lerian, Greek and Italian restaurants, dishes and cooking styles. Some of the more unique offerings of Leros include gavafes, a unique tropical fruit that grows only in Leros; mizithra, a local hard, salty cheese often cured in the sediment of red wine; Kolios Pastos, mackerel cured in sea salt; Lerian Thyme honey, a particularly flavourful honey derived from the thyme-filled hills of Leros; Pougkakia, a Lerian dessert offered at weddings (but commonly available in the many sweets shops in Leros); Patsavouropita (a cake with layers of filo and syrup); Soumada, a sweet drink made of almonds; and Lerian cheese pie.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Thucydides stressed the special importance of the bays and the harbours of Leros during the Peloponnesian War (431 BC – 404 BC), where Leros supported the democratic Athenians. After the end of the war, Leros came under the sovereignty of the Spartans. The island had a famous sanctuary of the greek goddess Artemis.

It then followed the fate of the rest of the Dodecanese Islands during the years of Alexander the Great and his successors, the Roman years and the Byzantine period. After the division of the Roman Empire, Leros was part of the Byzantine Empire. On the island of Farmaco east from Leros, a few miles from Didyma on the Turkish coast, Julius Caesar was held as a hostage by local pirates for forty days.

===Venetian and Ottoman Era===
During the Byzantine Age, the island was incorporated into the Theme of Samos. During the thirteenth century, the island was occupied by the Genoese and then by the Venetians. In the year 1309, the Knights of St John seized and fortified Leros. In 1505, the Ottoman Admiral Kemal Reis, with three galleys and seventeen other warships, besieged the castle but could not capture it. The operation was repeated in 1508 with more ships, but again nothing was achieved.

Legend has it that then the island was rescued by the only surviving knight, barely 18 years old. He dressed women and children in the armor of the dead defenders, convincing the Ottomans that the garrison of Leros was still strong. Finally, on 24 December 1522, following the siege of Rhodes, a treaty was signed between Sultan Suleiman and the Grand Master of the Knights, Philippe Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam, and Leros, along with all the Aegean possessions of the Order, passed into Ottoman hands which ruled the island with brief interruptions during a period of four hundred years.

During the Ottoman rule, and along with the other islands, Leros enjoyed a privileged regime, with partial autonomy and self–government. During the Greek Revolution of 1821, the island was liberated and became an important base for the re-supplying of the Greek Navy. Administratively, it came under the jurisdiction of the Temporary Committee of the Eastern Sporades.

With the Treaty of London, on 3 February 1830, however, which determined the borders of the newly established Greek state, the freed islands of the Eastern Sporades were given over to the Ottoman Empire again. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Leros had a total population of 6.754, consisting of 6.623 Greeks, 18 Muslims and 113 foreign citizens. In the &quot;Diary of the Prefecture of the Archipelago&quot; of 1886, Leros, along with the islands of Patmos, Lipsos and Fournoi, belonged to the Ottomans. The island&#x27;s administrative council was made up of both Greeks and Turks.

===Italian period===

In 1912, during the Libyan War against the Ottoman Empire, Italy occupied all of the Dodecanese islands. On May 12, 1912, the island was seized by the sailors of the Italian Navy cruiser &quot;San Giorgio&quot;. The Greek inhabitants of the islands declared the autonomy of the islands under the title &quot;The Aegean State&quot;, with the aim of unification with Greece, but with the outbreak of the First World War, these moves came to nothing, and Italy retained control of the islands.

From 1916 to 1918, the British used Leros as a naval base. In the Venizelos–Tittoni agreement of 1919, the island was to be returned to Greece, along with all of the Dodecanese except Rhodes, but after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War, Italy canceled the agreement. As a result, the Treaty of Lausanne confirmed the Italian possession of Leros and the Dodecanese.

The new Italian Fascist regime actively attempted to Italianize the Dodecanese, by making the Italian language compulsory, giving incentives to locals to adopt Italian nationality, and clamping down on Greek institutions.

During the 31 years that the Italians remained in Leros, they planned to build and fortify the island, since its strategic position and its large natural harbours (the largest of which, Lakki, is the largest deepwater harbour in the Mediterranean Sea), made it an ideal naval base. The fortification of Leros and the creation of a major naval base ensured that the Italians had control over an area of vital interest to the Allies (the Aegean, the Dardanelles and the Near East). Mussolini, who called Leros &quot;the Corregidor of the Mediterranean&quot;, saw the island as a crucial base for the Italian domination of the eastern Aegean Sea.

====Portolago/Lakki====

In the 1930s a new model town and major naval base, Portolago, was built by the Italian authorities. It is one of the best examples of Italian Rationalist architecture. Mussolini was said to have a mansion for himself in the town.

After Leros was transferred to Greece, it was renamed Lakki.

===World War II===

From 1940, when Italy entered the Second World War on the side of Germany, Leros suffered bombing raids by the British, including Port Laki, on 26 November 1940, by the Royal Navy (Fleet Air Arm) - Swordfish aircraft of 815 and 819 Squadrons, operating from HMS Illustrious. As a result of the excellent anchorage provided to warships by the many natural coves, the island was the second most bombed during World War Two (after Crete). On 8 September 1943, as Italy could not continue the war on the German side, it signed an armistice and came over to the Allied camp. After the Italian armistice, British reinforcements arrived on Leros and other Dodecanese islands and the island suffered continuous German aerial bombardment. One of the largest attacks was on the Greek Navy&#x27;s flagship, the , sunk by German bombers on Sunday, 26 September 1943, along with , while they were anchored in Portolago. The island of Leros was finally captured by German troops during Operation Taifun in airborne and amphibious assaults between 12–16 November 1943. The forces involved were paratroop units and a battalion from the elite Brandenburg division. The ground troops were supported by bombers of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Among them I. and II. group of Stuka-Wing 3. I. Group operated from Megara Air Base. The island remained under German occupation until the end of the war.

The 1957 novel and subsequent 1961 film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; by Alistair MacLean was contextually based on the Battle of Leros.

===Post-war history===
After the Germans evacuated the island, Leros came under British administration until 7 March 1948 when Leros, together with the other Dodecanese Islands, was united with Greece. During the post-war years, the Greek government utilized numerous buildings in Leros for various reasons. In 1959, the mental hospital of Leros was founded in Lepida. During the junta of the Colonels, the island was used as a place of internal exile for political dissenters, with old Italian barracks of the island used as an internment camp.
During the dictatorship period of Greece (1967-1974), 4,000 political prisoners were exiled in the same spaces of the mental hospital which were used as a concentration camp. In 1989, Leros came to Europe-wide attention as a result of a scandal involving embezzlement of funds and the maltreatment of about 3,000 mental patients at the mental hospital on the island. Funding from the government led to a rapid and substantial improvement in conditions. A June 2009 BBC report suggests these improvements have not all been sustained.

In December 2015, during the European migration crisis, the Greek Government along with the Alternate Migration Policy Minister (Ioannis Mouzalas) and the Mayor of Leros (Michalis Kolias), decided to build a refugees&#x27; reception centre. The camp is termed a &quot;hotspot&quot; and is able to shelter up to 1,000 individuals. The presence of asylum-seekers on Leros is controversial. Greek locals have attacked and harassed asylum-seekers and humanitarian aid workers alike.

The hotspot of Leros is located near the mental hospital which has been internationally known as &quot;Europe&#x27;s guilty secret&quot;, as coined in an Observer article. In the same space of Lepida (after almost 15 years of implementing deinstitutionalisation programmes financed by EU), about 200 patients are still accommodated in small rehabilitation structures.

<doc id="1005076" wikidata="Q630732" url="?curid=1005076" title="Catalyst (New Found Glory album)">
<text>Catalyst is the fourth studio album by American rock band New Found Glory, released on May 18, 2004 through Drive-Thru and Geffen Records. It was the band&#x27;s last album to be produced by Neal Avron until 2011&#x27;s Radiosurgery.

==Background==
New Found Glory released their third album &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; in June 2002 as a joint release between MCA and Drive-Thru Records. By December, the group were working on new songs, which vocalist Jordan Pundik said were &quot;getting a lot heavier and even more aggressive&quot;. Between April and June 2003, they co-headlined the Honda Civic Tour with Good Charlotte. They had a practice room backstage that allowed them to work on new material. Around this time, MCA Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group subsidiary Geffen Records, which resulted in its staff and roster being moved to Geffen. Bassist Ian Grushka thought that the merger was a positive experience, as he said MCA was &quot;kinda falling apart. Many people that worked for MCA were taking their job for granted and they were too comfortable...slacking off and not doing their job&quot;. In August, the group toured Australia and Japan, before taking a week&#x27;s break. After this, they started pre-production for their next album at the Hurley factory in Costa Mesa, California and the Swing House. Pre-production this time lasted longer than for previous material, as the band worked on 30 tracks. The group moved into a house together in Malibu, California, and worked on material whenever they wanted to. It gave them more free time, compared to their past records, to develop their song ideas.

==Production==
After playing two shows, the band began recording their next album in September 2003. The sessions were helmed by producer Neal Avron, and took place at Royaltone and Sunset Sound Studios. Avron was assisted by engineers Chris Wonzer, Ryan Castle and Femio Hernández. Castle and Travis Huff served as Pro Tools engineers. Recording finished in January 2004, after the band tracked 18 songs in total. A variety of session musicians appear on the recordings: David Campbell (string arrangements and viola on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;), Joel Derouin (violin on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;), Charlie Bisharat (violin on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;), Larry Corbett (cello on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;), Riley Avron (backing vocals on &quot;Your Biggest Mistake&quot;), Debra Byrd (backing vocals on &quot;Doubt Full&quot;), Angela Fisher (backing vocals on &quot;Doubt Full&quot;) and Tony Wilkins (backing vocals on &quot;Doubt Full&quot;).

In addition, members of the group&#x27;s contemporaries also appear: Freddy Cricien of Madball (backing vocals on &quot;Your Biggest Mistake&quot; and &quot;At Least I&#x27;m Known for Something&quot;), James Dewees of Reggie and the Full Effect (keyboards on &quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot;), Andy Jackson of Hot Rod Circuit (backing vocals on &quot;Over the Head, Below the Knees&quot;), Toby Morse of H2O (backing vocals on &quot;Over the Head, Below the Knees&quot;) and Hazen Street (backing vocals on &quot;Over the Head, Below the Knees&quot;). Tom Lord-Alge mixed the tracks at South Beach Studios, before they were mastered by Ted Jensen.

==Composition and lyrics==
When New Found Glory started out, they would write material they enjoyed and not overthink it. For their self-titled and &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; albums, they focused more on what their fans would like. With &quot;Catalyst&quot;, they returned to the earlier method of writing whatever they enjoyed. Pundik said the band wanted to reinvent themselves musically with &quot;Catalyst&quot;. Grushka said Gilbert wrote 95% of the music on the album, while he contributed a bridge and a few lyrics and Klein wrote the majority of the lyrics. Musically, the sound of &quot;Catalyst&quot; has been described as pop punk, showcasing influence from hardcore punk. In addition, it introduces a mini choir (&quot;Doubt Full&quot;), metal (&quot;At Least I&#x27;m Known for Something&quot;) and hardcore punk-esque (&quot;Intro&quot;) riffs, and string (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;) and keyboard (&quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot;) instruments to the group&#x27;s sound. Pundik said the guitars were &quot;a lot bigger sounding&quot;, compared to those heard on &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;. He added that the songs were predominantly riff-based. His vocals were compared to American Hi-Fi frontman Stacy Jones. Discussing the album&#x27;s title, Bolooki explained: &quot;A catalyst is something that can spark change or help bring about change without actually being changed by the reaction itself.&quot;

&quot;Intro&quot; is a short 37-second long song, which talks about people who treat punk rock as a fashion style. Gilbert came up with the riff to &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot; while driving. He was on his way to practice as he randomly started singing the riff. in his head. He subsequently wrote the rest of the song on the day. He said it was about &quot;any kind of relationship with someone goes sour and things go south from there.&quot; It drew comparison to Alkaline Trio. &quot;This Disaster&quot; sees Pundik singing in a higher vocal register, earning a comparison to Davey Havok of AFI. &quot;Truth of My Youth&quot; is an up-tempo track that was reminiscent of the group&#x27;s older material, and is followed by the ballad &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;. It talks about a couple&#x27;s love maturing, and features violins in the vein of Yellowcard. &quot;Your Biggest Mistake&quot; showed the band&#x27;s strength in writing pop punk material.

Gilbert wrote a lead part over the chorus in &quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot;, which Pundik jokingly said sounded like it was from &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Gilbert brought Dewees in to add a keyboard in the intro and chorus, earning it a comparison to the Get Up Kids. Bolooki said the drums were recorded in an isolation booth to give it an &quot;extremely tight [1980s] drum sound&quot;. The song went under the working title &quot;Belinda Carlisle&quot; due to its 1980s sound. According to Gilbert, the track is about making mistakes, and also serves as a wake-up call for &quot;a person to change. And if they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s all gonna be messed up.&quot; &quot;Ending in Tragedy&quot; is a ballad about a guy trying to save a relationship, and is followed by hardcore punk track &quot;At Least I&#x27;m Known for Something&quot;. &quot;No News Is Good News&quot; is influenced by new wave and discusses how the media can be obsessed on negative situations. The closing track &quot;Who Am I&quot; is followed on the CD by two hidden joke tracks.

==Release==
In January 2004, Gilbert played a handful of shows with his former band Shai Hulud. On February 18, 2004, &quot;Catalyst&quot; was announced for release in May. A music video was filmed for &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot; on March 15 in Los Angeles, California with director Meiert Avis. The track was released as a single on March 22, before being released to modern rock radio on April 6. On April 22, the &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot; music video was posted on Launch.com, and premiered on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; the following day. It features the band performing combined with clay models and computer graphics created by French animation company No Brains. The group went with Avis&#x27; treatment as they were tired of previous proposals that attempted to convey heartbreak, and instead went with one that had no relation to the lyrics. &quot;Catalyst&quot; was made available for streaming on May 13, before being released on May 18 through Geffen and Drive-Thru Records. Grushka said Drive-Thru had no involvement in album, but they kept the label&#x27;s &quot;logo on our CDs because we feel they had a big part in helping us to get to this level&quot;. Some CD copies had an enhanced portion that featured a making of the music video for &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot;. Copies purchased from Best Buy included a code to download the bonus track &quot;Whiskey Rose&quot;. To promote its release, the group did a series of club shows, festival appearances, in-store performances, MTV interviews, and an appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.
A music video was filmed for &quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot; in late June with Avis directing again. Between late June and mid-August, the group performed on the Warped Tour. For the outing, Dewees joined the group as a touring keyboardist. &quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot; was released to radio on July 26. The music video for it premiered two days later on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The clip shows the band shrunken down and held captive by two regular-sized individuals. They eventually escape and stumble into a party. However, due to their size, they are ignored. The group start performing; the music they make starts to animate characters such as a vampire from a TV and aliens from a video game. Later on, the band is shown asleep, before being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner. &quot;Truth of My Youth&quot; was released as a single on August 17. At the end of the month and the start of September, the group went on a brief European tour, which included performances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

On September 20, a music video was filmed for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; in Los Angeles with director Liz Friedlander. Following the filming, the group played a few shows in Japan with Yellowcard and Hazen Street. In October and November, the group supported Green Day on their headlining US tour. On October 25, a music video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; premiered on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The following day, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was released to modern rock radio, and &quot;Failure&#x27;s Not Flattering&quot; was released as a single. In December, the group went on an Australia tour with support from Reggie and the Full Effect, Righteous Jams, the Explosion and Hot Water Music. In January 2005, the band supported Green Day on a tour of Europe. Following this, the band went on a headlining UK tour, which lasted until mid-February, with Hot Water Music and the Explosion. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was released as a single on February 14. Between early March and late May, the band went on a headlining club tour, dubbed the Back to Basics Tour. They were supported by Reggie and the Full Effect and Eisley.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Sean Richardson praised the band for adding tracks that range from &quot;string-laden balladry (”I Don’t Wanna Know”) to surging hardcore (”At Least I’m Known for Something”)&quot; alongside their pop punk repertoire, concluding that &quot;They may have eyes for the Top 40, but these skater boys still know how to rock.&quot; Johnny Loftus from AllMusic said, &quot;&quot;Catalyst&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite graduate New Found Glory from the punk-pop rungs. From its main aesthetic thrust to the pristine mixing and production, this is a slick and durable Drive-Thru missive, micro-tweaked for maximum Warped Tour ROI. Still, the guys in NFG have been at this a while, so a little exploration is not only understandable, it&#x27;s expected. To that end, &quot;Catalyst&quot;″s East Coast hardcore kickoff is welcome.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Kirk Miller gave note of the &#x27;80s thrash metal aesthetics that tracks like &quot;This Disaster&quot; and &quot;At Least I Am Known for Something&quot; utilize, as well as other various subgenres (&quot;hardcore punk, synth-rock and emo-tinged ballads&quot;) throughout the track listing, concluding that &quot;[T]he band&#x27;s extra effort shows, giving its pop glory some newfound energy.&quot;

Robert Christgau graded the album as a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Blair R. Fischer criticized Jordan Pundik&#x27;s vocal performance for getting &quot;more irritating with every song.&quot;

===Commercial performance and legacy===
The album debuted at a career-high number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, after selling 146,000 copies in its first week. It was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August 2004. As of June 2005, the album has sold over 600,000 copies. The &quot;All Downhill from Here&quot; music video was nominated for Best Breakthrough Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards.

Philip Obenschain of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; said the album was a &quot;nostalgic snapshot of a mid-career transition&quot;, which not only displayed what the group were capable of when under pressure, but also that &quot;pop-punk could reach a broader radio and MTV audience without compromising its credibility&quot;. In 2016, Gilbert ranked &quot;Catalyst&quot; as his second-to-least favorite New Found Glory album. Looking back, he said it &quot;doesn’t really make any sense … &quot;Catalyst&quot; is all over the place [musically].&quot; The group performed the album in its entirety on a tour in 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary since they formed.

<doc id="1005079" wikidata="Q3179371" url="?curid=1005079" title="Jo Anne Worley">
<text>Jo Anne Worley (born September 6, 1937) is an American actress, comedian, and singer. Her work covers television, films, theater, game shows, talk shows, commercials, and cartoons. Worley is widely known for her work on the comedy-variety show &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Worley was born on September 6, 1937, in Lowell, Indiana, the third child of Rose Irene (née Gardner) and Joseph Lauraine Worley. In 1962, her parents divorced and her father remarried, having four children with his second wife, Nancy.

Always known for her loud voice, Worley once said that when she attended church as a little girl, she never sang the hymns but would only lip sync them for fear that she would drown out everyone else. Before graduating from high school, she was named school comedienne.

After graduating from high school in 1955, Worley moved to Blauvelt, New York, where she began her professional career as a member of the Pickwick Players. This led to a drama scholarship to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.

== Career ==

After studying at Midwestern for two years, Worley moved to Los Angeles to study at Los Angeles City College and the Pasadena Playhouse. She was soon given her first musical role in a production of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;. In 1961, Worley received her first major break when she appeared in the musical revue &quot;Billy Barnes People&quot; in Los Angeles; this production moved to Broadway, where it ran for only six performances. However, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote: &quot;Jo Anne Worley has an earthy style that suggests she could be a rowdy comedienne.&quot; In 1964, she was selected to appear as a stand-in on the original Broadway production of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; One year later, Worley created her own nightclub act in Greenwich Village, where she was discovered by Merv Griffin in 1966.

Impressed by Worley&#x27;s talents, Griffin engaged her to be one of his primary guest stars on his show, where she made approximately 40 appearances on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. In 1966, she appeared Off-Broadway in &quot;The Mad Show&quot;, a musical revue based on &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;. In 1967, Worley&#x27;s stint on Griffin&#x27;s show led to her discovery by George Schlatter, who soon cast her in &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

In 1970, Worley left &quot;Laugh-In&quot; to pursue other projects and has made guest appearances on several television series, including &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The Middle&quot;, and different game shows such as &quot;Super Password&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, and the many versions of &quot;Pyramid&quot;. She continued working in various movies, television series, and theatrical performances (original productions and revivals alike) over the years. Worley also became known for her work as a voice provider for several cartoons, animated movies, and video games. Her voice work includes &quot;Nutcracker Fantasy&quot; (1979), the Disney movies &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991), &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), &quot;Beauty and the Beast: Belle&#x27;s Magical World&quot; (1998), and the voice of the Wardrobe in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (2005). She remains involved with Disney, making cameos in several Disney Channel sitcoms such as &quot;Kim Possible&quot; playing the role of Bonnie Rockwaller&#x27;s mother, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, and &quot;Jessie&quot;.

Worley performed in regional theater, such as the Melody Top Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she appeared in &quot;&quot; as Rose (1984), &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1982), &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; (1980), &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1978) and &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; (1974), She also appeared at the Welk Dinner Theater in San Diego, California in &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; in 1985, &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; at the California Music Theatre, Pasadena, California, in 1987, and &quot;Nunsense&quot; at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, La Mirada, California, in 1991.

In 1989, Worley returned to Broadway to appear in &quot;Prince of Central Park&quot;, but the show was canceled after four performances. She was cast as the Wicked Witch of the West in a 1999 musical production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, directed and adapted by Robert Johanson, with Mickey Rooney playing the eponymous role. The production had a limited run at the Pantages Theater, Hollywood, California, and at the Theater at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, and she also joined the limited US tour. Worley played Mrs. Tottendale in the Broadway musical, &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; at the Marquis Theatre from July through December 2007. She then reprised the role of Mrs. Tottendale at The Cape Playhouse from June to July 2015.

From January 8 until August 24, 2008, Worley played the role of Madame Morrible in the Los Angeles production of &quot;Wicked&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Worley is an animal lover. For more than 40 years she has been involved with the organization Actors and Others for Animals, founded in 1971, which funds spay-and-neuter programs, and provides veterinary financial assistance to pet guardians in Southern California. She served on a voluntary basis on the board of directors for several years before becoming vice president, and since 2007, has served as president of the organization.

<text>Theodore Watts-Dunton (12 October 1832 – 6 June 1914), from St Ives, Huntingdonshire, was an English poetry critic with major periodicals, and himself a poet. He is remembered particularly as the friend and minder of Algernon Charles Swinburne, whom he rescued from alcoholism and drug use and persuaded to continue writing.

==Birth and education==
Walter Theodore Watts was born at St Ives, in what was then Huntingdonshire. He added his mother&#x27;s maiden name Dunton to his surname in 1897. He was originally educated as a naturalist, and saw much of the East Anglian Gypsies, of whose superstitions and folklore he made careful study. Abandoning natural history for the law, he qualified as a solicitor and went to London, where he practised for some years, giving his spare time to his chosen pursuit of literature. One of his clients was Swinburne, whom he befriended in 1872.

==Literary contributions==
Watts-Dunton contributed regularly to &quot;The Examiner&quot; from 1874 and to &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; from 1875 until 1898, being for more than twenty years the principal poetry critic of poetry in the latter. He wrote widely for other publications and contributed several articles to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 9th edition (1885), of which the most significant was the one on &quot;Poetry&quot; in the ninth edition, where he explored poetry&#x27;s first principles.

==Literary associations==

Watts-Dunton had considerable influence as the friend of many of the leading men of letters of his time; he enjoyed the confidence of Tennyson and contributed an appreciation of him to the authorised biography. He was in later years Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s most intimate friend (Rossetti made a portrait of Watts in pastel in 1874). In 1879 Swinburne&#x27;s alcoholic dysentery so alarmed him that he moved the poet into his semi-detached home, The Pines, 11 Putney Hill, Putney, which they shared for nearly thirty years until Swinburne&#x27;s death in 1909.

Watts&#x27; household included his sister Miranda Mason, her husband Charles (also a solicitor), her son, Bertie (born 1874) and later, a second sister. They also employed a live-in cook and a housemaid. Watts-Dunton married Clara Reich on 29 November 1905 and she settled into the family with ease.

==Swinburne and Dunn==

Watts is widely praised for extending Swinburne&#x27;s life and encouraging his enthusiasm for the landscape verse that was amongst the best of his later works. However, Watts has also been castigated for sabotaging the completion of Swinburne&#x27;s erotic sadomasochistic novel &quot;Lesbia Brandon&quot;. Even so, he was not able to wean Swinburne of his interest in flagellation.

Watts-Dunton later decided also to take in Henry Treffry Dunn, who had been one of Rossetti&#x27;s assistants. Like Swinburne, Dunn was prone to alcoholism. He died in 1899 whilst still living with Watts-Dunton and Swinburne.

==Publications==
It was not until 1897 that Watts-Dunton published a poetry volume under his own name, albeit with the addition of his mother&#x27;s maiden name. His erstwhile friend Whistler sent him a letter mocking his perceived aggrandisement: &quot;Theodore,&quot; it read, &quot;What&#x27;s Dunton?&quot; The book was his collection of poems called &quot;The Coming of Love&quot;, some of which he had printed previously in periodicals.

In the following year his prose romance &quot;Aylwin&quot; attained immediate success and ran through many editions in the course of a few months. The late 19th-century English novelist George Gissing noted in his diary in November 1898 that the novel had been &quot;extravagantly praised&quot;, but that Gissing thought it showed a &quot;dull mechanism&quot;. Both &quot;The Coming of Love&quot; and &quot;Aylwin&quot; set forth – the one in poetry, the other in prose – the romantic and passionate associations of Romany life, and maintain the traditions of George Borrow, whom Watts-Dunton had known well in his own youth.
Imaginative glamour and mysticism are their prominent characteristics, and the novel in particular was credited with bringing pure romance back into public favour.

Watts-Dunton edited Borrow&#x27;s &quot;Lavengro&quot; in 1893 and &quot;Romany Rye&quot; in 1903. In 1903 he also published &quot;The Renascence of Wonder&quot;, a treatise on the romantic movement. His &quot;Studies of Shakespeare&quot; appeared in 1910. But it was not only in his published work that Watts-Dunton&#x27;s influence on the literary life of his time was potent. His long and intimate association with Rossetti and Swinburne made him a unique figure in the world of letters. His grasp of metrical principle and of the historic perspective of English poetry brought him respect as a literary critic.

Theodore Watts-Dunton died at The Pines, Putney, on 6 June 1914, and was survived by his wife, Clara (née Reich). He is buried at West Norwood Cemetery, where his monument is a low capped stone. A blue plaque marks his home in Putney.

==In popular culture==
Watts-Dunton&#x27;s elongated name was celebrated by Stephen Potter&#x27;s book on Gamesmanship, in which the Dunton-Watts supercharger was merely a thrust in the motoring gamesman&#x27;s ploy to get one up on the opponent. When faced with an equally adept car man, the gamesman could expect a riposte involving the inevitably superior Watson-Dunn supercharger.

<text>FirstOntario Centre (originally Copps Coliseum) is a sports and entertainment arena at the corner of Bay Street North and York Boulevard in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1985, it has a capacity of up to 19,000.

==History==
Hamilton was left without a large ice hockey venue after the Barton Street Arena was demolished in 1977, and even that arena had a small seating capacity by modern standards. Construction on the new site was started in 1983 and completed two years later at a cost of $33.5 million, with an additional $2.3 million spent on a parking garage. The project was overseen by Hamiltonian Joseph Pigott.
The arena was originally named Copps Coliseum after long-time mayor Victor Copps, the patriarch of a Hamilton political family that includes his daughter, former Member of Parliament of Canada and Member of Provincial Parliament of Ontario Sheila Copps, and wife, Geraldine, who was a long-time councillor.

The arena&#x27;s first scoreboard was purchased from the Winnipeg Arena for $214,000. That original Day Signs/Naden scoreboard, built in Toronto, was replaced in the early-1990s by a centre-hung scoreboard with an electronic message centre on each side. In turn, it was replaced by the current scoreboard, which was built in Hamilton by Media Resources, featuring an LED video board on each side.

The arena has hosted many teams and events over the years. The Hamilton Steelhawks of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) began play at the arena in 1985. The 1986 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships were held in Southern Ontario, with Copps Coliseum used as the primary venue. In a decisive game, the undefeated Soviet Union handed Canada its first loss, 4–1. Copps was the primary host for the 1987 Canada Cup, and the site of the famous Gretzky to Lemieux goal that beat the Soviets 6–5 in the final. The Dukes of Hamilton replaced the Steelhawks as the city&#x27;s OHL team and played in Copps Coliseum from 1989 to 1991. The arena hosted the 1990 Memorial Cup and set the single game attendance record, on May 13, 1990, with 17,383 spectators watching the Oshawa Generals defeat the Kitchener Rangers, in the final, 4–3 in double overtime on a Bill Armstrong goal. The venue hosted a number of games in the 1991 Canada Cup, including the finals, when Canada defeated the United States.

The first WWF Royal Rumble, which was shown on the USA Network, was held in the arena on January 24, 1988. Copps hosted the WWF pay-per-view on September 27, 1998, and the Billy Graham crusade that year, attended by 19,000 spectators each night. The Grateful Dead played the Coliseum on four occasions, with two dates in 1990 and two dates in 1992.

Although the 2009 plan for the 2015 Pan American Games based around Toronto was to host the volleyball tournament in the Copps Coliseum, eventually it was held in the Toronto Exhibition Centre.

On January 3, 2014, Nitro Circus performed at the stadium for the first ever and only stop in Canada. Due to the high-risk nature of their stunt-based shows, most North American venues will not host the events.

On January 27, 2014, Hamilton City council voted unanimously to approve a $3.5-million deal to rename Copps Coliseum after local credit union First Ontario. The city unveiled the new look signage, FirstOntario Centre, later that spring. A smaller sign reading &quot;In honour of Victor K. Copps&quot; appears to its right on the Bay side of the arena, and below it on the York side.

In November 2022, it was announced that beginning in the late summer of 2023, the arena would close for 20 months due to renovations. This would force the Bulldogs and Rock to relocate for all of the 2023–24 season and most of the 2024–25 season. As a result of the closure, the Honey Badgers decided to permanently relocate to Brampton, Ontario and the Bulldogs relocated to Brantford, Ontario. The renovations were delayed until December 2023 which allowed the Rock to play their first couple games of the 2023–24 season at the arena, before moving to the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, Ontario. This also allowed five Cirque du Soleil performances at the arena before its closing. However, in September 2023, it was announced that renovations would be delayed once again and that the Toronto Rock would play the entirety of the 2023–24 season in Hamilton. Major construction finally began in May 2024 with completion planned for November 2025. 

===Basketball===
The Hamilton Skyhawks debuted with a 101–99 win over the Halifax Windjammers in World Basketball League play, in 1992. The league folded during the season, and several Canadian teams, including the Skyhawks formed the National Basketball League for 1993, but the Hawks moved to Edmonton for the playoffs, then folded.

The Coliseum was host to the 1994 FIBA World Championship, along with Maple Leaf Gardens and SkyDome. The next year, the Centre hosted the FIBA Americas Championship for Women, which was won by Canada. During their first two seasons of play (1995–96 and 1996–97), prior to the completion of construction on their new home the Air Canada Centre, the Toronto Raptors played three regular season games at Copps Coliseum, as well as a preseason game in 1997. In 1998 a strange twist of scheduling conflicts led the Toronto Raptors to play their final regular season game in Hamilton, as the Toronto Blue Jays had first right of refusal for all SkyDome dates. The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.

===AHL and OHL===
The American Hockey League expanded to Copps in 1992 in the form of Vancouver&#x27;s affiliate, the Hamilton Canucks. After two seasons, the team was moved to Syracuse, where they became one of the league&#x27;s most stable franchises.

In October 1996, Copps Coliseum became home to the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League. The Bulldogs, who were the top affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers (1996–2003) and the Montreal Canadiens (2002–2015), brought over 2 million fans to the arena. On June 7, 2007, the AHL Hamilton Bulldogs won their first Calder Cup Championship in franchise history at home in Copps Coliseum, defeating the Hershey Bears.

In 2015, Montreal moved its AHL affiliate to St. John&#x27;s, and the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Belleville Bulls moved to Hamilton to carry the Bulldogs banner, and Hamilton&#x27;s traditional black and yellow colours, in the junior league. The Bulldogs are the primary tenant in the facility.

===NHL ambitions===
Copps Coliseum was built to National Hockey League capacity and specifications in the hope that it would allow Hamilton to acquire an NHL expansion franchise. However, said arena is just 36.3 miles from the home venue of the Toronto Maple Leafs and 57.9 miles from the home venue of the Buffalo Sabres, both of which have opposed an NHL franchise in Hamilton. Copps hosted 8 regular-season neutral-site games during the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons, mostly featuring the Maple Leafs or Sabres.

In 2007, Waterloo billionaire Jim Balsillie, co-CEO of Research in Motion, made an offer to purchase the Nashville Predators for $220 million US. His intention was to move the team to Hamilton and either use Copps Coliseum as a temporary home while a new state-of-the-art arena could be built, or to renovate the Coliseum to bring it up to modern NHL standards. The bid was unsuccessful. In the spring of 2009, the Phoenix Coyotes filed for bankruptcy and Jim Balsillie immediately offered a rumoured $212.5 million US, while stating he wanted to move the franchise to southwestern Ontario. Balsillie applied for a lease option which, should the relocation have succeeded, would have invoked a 20-year lease for the team to play at Copps Coliseum. On May 9, 2009, the Toronto Star, Hamilton Spectator and others reported that Hamilton mayor Fred Eisenberger was to meet with a second group interested in securing a lease. The group, led by Vancouver businessmen Tom Gaglardi and Nelson Skalbania, was interested in securing an interest in the Atlanta Thrashers and moving them to the centre for the 2010–11 NHL season. The team moved to Winnipeg in 2011, becoming the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets instead. On May 13, 2009, The Canadian Press reported on TSN.ca that Balsillie won the exclusive rights to Hamilton&#x27;s Copps Coliseum until November after a unanimous vote by Hamilton city council. On May 29, 2009, Balsillie unveiled his plans to renovate the Centre into a state-of-the-art facility in anticipation of an NHL franchise coming to Hamilton. It is unknown whether these renovations will come to fruition since Balsillie lost his bid to buy the Coyotes.

===Curling===
In 2007, from March 3 to 11, Copps Coliseum hosted the 2007 Tim Hortons Brier, the annual Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship. The Coliseum hosted the West 49 Canadian Open, from September 20 to October 1.

<text>Herodes Atticus (; AD 101–177) was an Athenian rhetorician, as well as a Roman senator. A great philanthropic magnate, he and his wife Appia Annia Regilla, for whose murder he was potentially responsible, commissioned many Athenian public works, several of which stand to the present day. He was one of the best-known figures of the Antonine Period, and taught rhetoric to the Roman emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, and was advanced to the consulship in 143. His full name as a Roman citizen was Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes.

According to Philostratus, Herodes Atticus, in possession of the best education that money could buy, was a notable proponent of the Second Sophistic. Having gone through the &quot;cursus honorum &quot;of civil posts, he demonstrated a talent for civil engineering, especially the design and construction of water-supply systems. The Nymphaeum at Olympia was one of his dearest projects. However, he never lost sight of philosophy and rhetoric, becoming a teacher himself. One of his students was the young Marcus Aurelius, last of the &quot;Five Good Emperors&quot;. M.I. Finley describes Herodes Atticus as &quot;patron of the arts and letters (and himself a writer and scholar of importance), public benefactor on an imperial scale, not only in Athens but elsewhere in Greece and Asia Minor, holder of many important posts, friend and kinsman of emperors.&quot;

==Ancestry and family==
Herodes Atticus was a Greek of Athenian descent. His ancestry could be traced to the Athenian noblewoman Elpinice, a half-sister of the statesman Cimon and daughter of Miltiades. He claimed lineage from a series of mythic Greek kings: Theseus, Cecrops, and Aeacus, as well as the god Zeus. His father&#x27;s family, known as the Claudii of Marathon, rose to prominence in the late first century BC, when his great-great-great grandfather Herodes and his great-great grandfather Eucles forged links with Julius Caesar and Augustus. The family received Roman citizenship from Emperor Claudius, receiving the Roman nomen Claudius. They were exceptionally wealthy. 

Herodes&#x27; father, Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes entered the Roman Senate and became Roman consul, the first Athenian to do so. His mother was the wealthy heiress Vibullia Alcia Agrippina. He had a brother named Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodianus and a sister named Claudia Tisamenis. His maternal grandparents were Claudia Alcia and Lucius Vibullius Rufus, while his paternal grandfather was Hipparchus.

His parents were related as uncle and niece. His maternal grandmother and his father were sister and brother. His maternal uncle Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus was an Archon of Athens in the years 99–100 and his maternal cousin, Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus, was an Archon of Athens between 143–144.

==Life==


Herodes Atticus was born in Marathon, Greece, and spent his childhood years between Greece and Italy. According to Juvenal he received an education in rhetoric and philosophy from many of the best teachers from both Greek and Roman culture. Throughout his life, however, Herodes Atticus remained entirely Greek in his cultural outlook.

He was a student of Favorinus and inherited Favorinus&#x27; library. Like Favorinus, he was a harsh critic of Stoicism.

these disciplines of the cult of the unemotional, who want to be considered calm, brave, and steadfast because they show neither desire nor grief, neither anger nor pleasure, cut out the more active emotions of the spirit and grow old in a torpor, a sluggish, enervated life.

In 125, Emperor Hadrian appointed him prefect of the free cities in the Roman province of Asia. He later returned to Athens, where he became famous as a teacher. In the year 126-127, Herodes Atticus was elected and served as an Archon of Athens. Later in 140, the Emperor Antoninus Pius invited him to Rome from Athens to educate his two adopted sons, the future Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Sometime after, he was betrothed to Appia Annia Regilla, a wealthy aristocrat, who was related to the wife of Antoninus Pius, Faustina the Elder. When Regilla and Herodes Atticus married, she was 14 years old and he was 40. As a mark of his friendship, Antoninus Pius appointed Herodes Atticus consul in 143.

Herodes Atticus and Regilla controlled a large tract around the third mile of the Appian Way outside Rome, which was known as the &quot;Triopio&quot; (from Triopas, King of Thessaly). For his remaining years he travelled between Greece and Italy.

Some time after his consulship, he returned to Greece permanently with his wife and their children.

In 160, the year that her brother was consul, Regilla, while eight months pregnant, was brutally kicked in the abdomen by a freedman of Herodes Atticus named Alcimedon. This caused her to go into premature labor, killing her. Consul Appius Annius Atilius Bradua brought charges against his brother-in-law in Rome, alleging that Herodes Atticus had ordered her beaten to death; the emperor Marcus Aurelius exonerated his old tutor of his wife&#x27;s murder.

Herodes Atticus was the teacher of three notable students: Achilles, Memnon and Polydeuces (Polydeukes). &quot;The aged Herodes Atticus in a public paroxysm of despair at the death of his perhaps &quot;eromenos&quot; Polydeukes, commissioned games, inscriptions and sculptures on a lavish scale and then died, inconsolable, shortly afterwards.&quot; He also taught many orators and philosophers such as Aristocles of Pergamon.

Herodes Atticus had a distinguished reputation for his literary work, most of which is now lost, and was a philanthropist and patron of public works. He funded more building projects in Roman Greece than anyone aside from the Roman emperors, including:
* The Panathenaic Stadium – Athens
* Odeon – Athens; built to honor the memory of his wife
* A theater at Corinth
* A stadium at Delphi
* The baths at Thermopylae
* An aqueduct at Canusium in Italy
* An aqueduct at Alexandria Troas
* A nymphaeum (monumental fountain) with his wife at Olympia
* various benefactions to the peoples of Thessaly, Epirus Euboea, Boeotia and Peloponnesus

He also contemplated cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth, but was deterred from carrying out the plan because the same thing had been unsuccessfully attempted before by the emperor Nero.

Throughout his life, Herodes Atticus had a stormy relationship with the citizens of Athens, but before he died he was reconciled with them. When he died, the citizens of Athens gave him an honored burial, his funeral taking place in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens, which he had commissioned.

==Children==
Regilla bore Herodes Atticus six children, of whom three survived to adulthood. They were:

* Son, Claudius – born and died in 141
* Daughter, Elpinice – born as &quot;Appia Annia Claudia Atilia Regilla Elpinice Agrippina Atria Polla&quot;, 142–165
* Daughter, Athenais (Marcia Annia Claudia Alcia Athenais Gavidia Latiaria), married Lucius Vibullius Rufus. They had a son, Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus, the only recorded grandchild of Herodes Atticus.
* Son, Atticus Bradua – born in 145 as &quot;Tiberius Claudius Marcus Appius Atilius Bradua Regillus Atticus&quot;
* Son, Regillus – born as &quot;Tiberius Claudius Herodes Lucius Vibullius Regillus&quot;, 150–155
* Unnamed child who died with Regilla or perhaps three months later in 160

After Regilla died in 160, Herodes Atticus never married again. Sometime after his wife&#x27;s death, he adopted his cousin&#x27;s first grandson Lucius Vibullius Claudius Herodes as his son. When Herodes Atticus died in 177, his son Atticus Bradua and his grandchild survived him. 

==Legacy==
Herodes Atticus and his wife Regilla, from the 2nd century until the present, have been considered great benefactors in Greece, in particular in Athens. The couple are commemorated in Herodou Attikou Street and Rigillis Street and Square, in downtown Athens. In Rome, their names are also recorded on modern streets, in the Quarto Miglio suburb close to the area of the Triopio.

<text>The Cross Bronx Expressway is a major freeway in the New York City borough of the Bronx. It is mainly designated as part of Interstate 95 (I-95), but also includes portions of I-295 and U.S. Route 1 (US 1). The Cross Bronx begins at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge over the Harlem River. While I-95 leaves at the Bruckner Interchange in Throgs Neck, following the Bruckner Expressway and New England Thruway to Connecticut, the Cross Bronx Expressway continues east, carrying I-295 to the merge with the Throgs Neck Expressway near the Throgs Neck Bridge. Though the road goes primarily northwest-to-southeast, the nominal directions of all route numbers west of the Bruckner Interchange are aligned with the northbound route number going southeast, and the southbound route number going northwest.

The Cross Bronx Expressway was conceived by Robert Moses and built between 1948 and 1972. It was the first highway built through a crowded urban environment in the United States; the most expensive mile of road ever built to that point is part of the Cross Bronx, costing $40 million (). At one point during construction, Moses&#x27; crews had to support the Grand Concourse (a major surface thoroughfare), a subway line and several elevated train lines while the expressway was laboriously pushed through. The highway experiences severe traffic problems, and its construction has been blamed for negatively affecting a number of low-income neighborhoods in the South Bronx. Most Bronxites consider the Cross Bronx Expressway the defining border between the North and the South Bronx.

==Route description==
The Cross Bronx Expressway begins at the eastern end of the Alexander Hamilton Bridge, officially designated as both I-95 and US 1. Immediately after coming off the bridge, there is an interchange with the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87) for Yankee Stadium and points upstate. The highway soon intersects with Webster Avenue at a partial interchange allowing eastbound vehicles to exit and westbound ones to enter. Northbound US 1 leaves the Cross Bronx Expressway at this exit. About later, the expressway has a pair of closely spaced interchanges for NY 895 (Sheridan Boulevard) and the Bronx River Parkway. The exit for Sheridan Boulevard is an incomplete interchange and allows access from northbound and to southbound I-95 only.

The Cross Bronx Expressway reaches the Bruckner Interchange later. The service road is called East 177th Street between the Bronx River Parkway and the Bruckner Interchange. Going eastbound (I-95 northbound), the interchange allows access to southbound I-678, northbound I-95 (Bruckner Expressway) and southbound I-295. I-95 leaves the Cross Bronx Expressway here and continues north along the Bruckner Expressway. The Cross Bronx Expressway continues east of the interchange as I-295, which begins here. The Cross Bronx connects with the Throgs Neck Expressway, where traffic from I-695 merges on before the expressway ends at the northern approach to the Throgs Neck Bridge.

==History==

=== Planning ===
The 1929 Report on Highway Traffic Conditions and Proposed Traffic Relief Measures for the City of New York was the first citywide traffic study, classifying a number of projects that had been proposed by local interests. A &quot;Cross-Bronx Route&quot; along 161st and 163rd Streets was one of two proposed facilities, along with the &quot;Nassau Boulevard&quot; (which became the Long Island Expressway), picked by borough engineers as examples of important projects. Although this routing was south of the present Cross Bronx Expressway, the report did suggest a &quot;New Cross-Bronx Artery&quot; near the present expressway that would link the Washington Bridge with the Clason Point Ferry to Queens. Though it would not be built to freeway standards, it would be 60 feet (18 m) wide with grade separations &quot;where considered necessary and desirable.&quot; The George Washington Bridge, then under construction, was cited among reasons to build the highway which would help connect New Jersey to Long Island via the bridges and ferry.

In 1936, the Regional Plan Association (RPA) proposed a highway that would connect the Bronx to New England and points north. In late 1940, the New York City Planning Commission adopted a plan for a network of highways. Except for the Bronx and Pelham Parkway, which lay to the north, no cross-Bronx highway had been built up to this point. The report stated that the &quot;Bronx Crosstown Highway&quot;, which would now connect on the east end to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge (which had replaced the Clason Point Ferry), was &quot;an essential part of a desirable highway pattern&quot;, taking traffic from the George Washington Bridge to Long Island and New England. The cost was estimated at $17 million, higher than most improvements because of the &quot;topographical conditions, high land values, and heavily built-up areas&quot;. 

=== Construction ===

In the 1940s, city planner Robert Moses proposed the construction of a system of highways that would traverse the New York City area. The plan was to cost $800 million (equivalent to $ in ), and, in February 1945, the city agreed to pay $60 million (equivalent to $ in ) of that cost. That November, the city, state, and federal governments agreed to fund several new highways in New York City. Among these was the Cross Bronx Expressway, which was to cost $38.67 million. The expressway was to continue onto the 181st Street Bridge at its western end, connecting with the 178th–179th Street Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge via a set of ramps. At its eastern end, the expressway would connect with the Hutchinson River Parkway and New England Thruway at the Bruckner Interchange.

The New York City Board of Estimate approved a contract in February 1946, allowing the Tenant Relocation Bureau to relocate 540 families who lived on the expressway&#x27;s right-of-way. The New York City Council adopted a resolution the next month, asking the Board of Estimate to delay the relocations, which were scheduled to start that June. City officials said that only 55 families would be relocated in 1946 and that all existing residents would be relocated before construction started. By late 1947, the city and state governments were relocating residents in the expressway&#x27;s path. The city and state started soliciting bids for construction contracts that December. Although the city and state planned to demolish 164 structures on the expressway&#x27;s right-of-way, they were reluctant to raze all of the structures immediately because of a housing shortage in New York City. The city government was able to obtain this land through the eminent domain process.

Construction of the expressway began in 1948. A 112-foot open cut was excavated, accommodating six traffic lanes and four cobblestone shoulders. This project proved to be one of the most difficult expressway projects at the time; construction required blasting through ridges, crossing valleys and redirecting small rivers. In doing so, minimal disruption to the apartment buildings that topped the ridges in the area of Grand Concourse was a priority. Moreover, the expressway had to cross 113 streets, seven expressways and parkways (some of which were under construction), as well as numerous subway and train lines. The highway also passed by hundreds of utility, water and sewer lines, none of which could be interrupted. The highway was to contain 54 bridges and three tunnels when it was completed. By early 1949, the project&#x27;s budget had increased to $53 million, in part because of material shortages.

==== Eastern section ====

By early 1949, the first section of the expressway, between Olmstead Avenue and Westchester Creek, was not planned to be completed until 1951. The Gull Construction Company was contracted to build this segment in May 1949, and Rusciano &amp; Sons was hired the same month to build the footings for six bridges along the expressway. In addition, Frederick H. Zurmuhlen was supervising the construction of a bridge over Westchester Creek at a cost of $5,287,000; the ten-lane bridge was to supplement a surface-level span. Engineering firms Andrews &amp; Clark and Hardesty &amp; Hanover were hired to supervise the project later in 1949. A short segment near Bruckner Boulevard opened in 1950 and was the first part of the expressway to be completed. 

The state government hired the J. Kaufman Demolition Company in 1951 to raze structures on the right-of-way east of the Bronx River Parkway. By early 1953, part of the highway east of the Bronx River Parkway was also being constructed. The construction of this section required excavating underneath the Parkchester station of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Line. In addition, the Bronx River had to be relocated several hundred feet in the vicinity of the Bronx River Parkway interchange. The section from the Bronx River Parkway to the Bruckner Interchange opened on November 5, 1955, at the same time as parts of the Queens Midtown and Major Deegan expressways. The first portion of the Cross Bronx Expressway had cost $34.6 million and was about long. The segment was six lanes wide; its original western end was at Rosedale Avenue, where ramps connected to the northbound Bronx River Parkway. A one-mile (1.5 km) western extension from the Bronx River Parkway to a temporary interchange at Longfellow Avenue, near Boston Road, opened on April 23, 1956. 

When the Throgs Neck Bridge to Queens opened on January 11, 1961, the Cross Bronx was extended east as one of the bridge&#x27;s two northern approaches, the other being the Throgs Neck Expressway (later I-695). Both extensions were part of the Interstate Highway System. The Cross Bronx Expressway Extension and the Clearview Expressway were originally designated as part of I-78, which was to continue through Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. Ultimately, most of I-78 was canceled in 1971. In anticipation of this change, the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension and the Clearview Expressway were renumbered I-295 on January 1, 1970.

==== Central section ====
The section of the Cross Bronx Expressway between Anthony and Longfellow Avenues was highly controversial. In early 1953, Bronx borough president James J. Lyons proposed relocating the Cross Bronx Expressway near Crotona Park in order to preserve 1,000 houses in the expressway&#x27;s right-of-way. Under Lyons&#x27;s plan, the highway would curve slightly southward and run along the northern edge of Crotona Park, creating a &quot;kink&quot; in the routing. Moses, who called Lyons&#x27;s proposal &quot;unreasonable&quot;, threatened to resign from his position as city construction coordinator if Lyons&#x27;s alternative was approved. Moses also threatened to cancel federal funding for the entire project. After an acrimonious public hearing in April 1953, the Board of Estimate could not agree on whether to relocate the expressway along Crotona Park. State officials supported Moses&#x27;s original plan, saying that the Crotona Park alternative would create &quot;curves and reverse curves of sub-standard radius&quot;. Ultimately, the Board of Estimate approved Moses&#x27;s original alignment that May.
By 1954, the project&#x27;s cost had increased to $86 million, but land for the western section of the expressway had not even been purchased, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to describe the existing sections as a &quot;road to nowhere&quot;. Although the Cross Bronx Expressway had been one of the first highways planned in New York City, it was estimated that the expressway would be the last project to be completed. In November 1954, the Board of Estimate voted unanimously to buy land for the section between Anthony and Longfellow Avenues, despite continued opposition from Bronx residents. At the time, officials estimated that the central section of the expressway would cost $21 million. Of this cost, $8 million would be spent on acquiring the land and relocating 1,462 families. By 1956, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that the center section was not expected to be completed for several years because of the expense of relocating tenants. 

Construction of the section between exits 3 and 2B began in early 1958, at which point the project&#x27;s total cost had increased to $101 million. The most expensive part of the project was the segment between exits 2B and 2A in Tremont, Bronx, which was planned to cost $11.788 million; it included a tunnel under the Grand Concourse and the underground Concourse Line, as well as an open cut that passed under five avenues. On April 27, 1960, another 1.2-mile (2 km) piece opened, taking the road west to Webster Avenue. Later that year, the westernmost of the expressway was closed to allow the completion of the Tremont section. The 0.6-mile (1 km) Tremont segment from Webster Avenue west to Jerome Avenue opened on February 10, 1961. By that time, all construction contracts for the remaining sections of the expressway had been awarded.

==== Western section ====

The 181st Street Bridge, and the ramps from the bridge to the existing 178th Street Tunnel and a new 179th Street Tunnel in Manhattan, were originally part of the Cross Bronx Expressway. In 1949, workers began widening the 181st Street Bridge, constructing the ramps, and excavating the 179th Street Tunnel. The widening was finished by 1950, and the tunnel and interchange opened on May 5, 1952. Originally, there had not been any plans to construct an interchange with the Major Deegan Expressway, at the highway&#x27;s western end, because of the area&#x27;s steep topography and limited space. In December 1952, the city and state reached an agreement to finance the construction of an interchange at that site.

Plans for the western end of the expressway were modified substantially after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced in 1957 that it would construct a lower deck on the George Washington Bridge. To accommodate the additional traffic from the George Washington Bridge, the Trans-Manhattan Expressway and Alexander Hamilton Bridge were to be constructed, connecting the George Washington Bridge and the Cross Bronx Expressway. The revised plans were announced in 1958. At the time, the Alexander Hamilton Bridge was planned to be completed in 1962, but the interchange with the Major Deegan would not open until two years after that. With the opening of the Alexander Hamilton Bridge in April 1963, the $128 million Cross Bronx was completed, but two major interchanges were still incomplete: the Highbridge Interchange with the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), and the Bruckner Interchange with the Bruckner Expressway (I-95/I-278), the Hutchinson River Parkway, and the Hutchinson River Expressway (I-678).

=== Later modifications ===
The $12.6 million Highbridge Interchange opened in November 1964. The $68 million reconstruction of the Bruckner Interchange, allowing Bruckner Expressway traffic to bypass the old traffic circle, opened on January 2, 1972. (Cross Bronx traffic passing through to the Throgs Neck Bridge had been able to avoid the circle, but drivers taking the Bruckner in either direction, including those bound for New England, had to exit onto the surface.)

In late 2023, the U.S. government allocated $150 million for bus lanes, sidewalks, and bicycle lanes on parts of the Cross Bronx Expressway. This was part of a $258 million project to replace five bridges along the expressway. The following June, the New York state and city governments began hosting meetings with local residents to determine how to reconnect neighborhoods that had been split during the expressway&#x27;s construction. The state government planned to finalize the designs for the five new bridges by late 2024; at the time, the project was scheduled to take four years. Several environmental groups objected to the bridge replacement, saying that the state government had not solicited enough feedback from local residents.

==Effects==

=== Urban decay ===
The Cross Bronx Expressway is blamed for worsening the decay of neighborhoods in the South Bronx, such as Tremont. In Robert Caro&#x27;s &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, the author argues that Moses intentionally directed the expressway through this neighborhood, even though there was a more viable option only one block south. The expressway&#x27;s construction displaced many residents, who generally were not relocated to adequate housing. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2022 that the areas near the Cross Bronx Expressway were among New York City&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods; these areas contained 220,000 residents, most of which were ethnic minorities.

Many of the neighborhoods it runs through have been continually poor since its construction, partly due to the lowered property value caused by the expressway. This is partially responsible for the public opposition to many other planned expressways in New York City that were later cancelled – in particular, the Lower Manhattan Expressway, and may have provided impetus to Jane Jacobs, an American expatriate, in her opposition to the Scarborough Expressway in Toronto. Architect Ronald Shiffman argues that the Cross Bronx Expressway &quot;ripped through the heart of the Bronx, creating what was a wall between what eventually was known as the Northern and Southern part of the Bronx.&quot;

=== Health issues ===
The Cross Bronx Expressway accounts for a large proportion of the Bronx&#x27;s roadway pollution. Bronx residents are more likely to have asthma than residents of other boroughs, and a large portion of those are children. Because things like dust, pollution, and other allergens serve as factors for developing asthma, children of color living in low-income areas in the Bronx are at risk of suffering from asthma exacerbation. Asthma rates in the Bronx are three times higher than the national average. In the Morris Heights neighborhood of the West Bronx, where the Cross Bronx and Major Deegan Expressways intersect, air-pollution rates are also generally higher than in the rest of the borough. To decrease emissions from the Cross Bronx Expressway, community activists proposed constructing a freeway lid in the early 2020s.

=== Congestion ===

The expressway is one of the main routes for shipping and transportation through New York City due to its connections with New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge, Long Island via the Throgs Neck and Whitestone Bridges, Upstate New York via I-87 northbound and the Bronx River Parkway, Manhattan via I-87 southbound to the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge or the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (extension of the Cross Bronx Expressway westward) and the Henry Hudson Parkway, and New England via the New England Thruway (I-95) and the Hutchinson River Parkway. As such, the expressway is also known for its extreme traffic problems; in 2000, nearly 180,000 vehicles used the Cross Bronx&#x27;s six lanes every day. It is not uncommon for truckers to use the Cross-Westchester Expressway to the New York State Thruway and the Major Deegan Expressway to get around this stretch of I-95. Proposals have been made to make dedicated truck lanes, add express bus service, and build decking on the open trenches to allow for parks, although to no avail.

In both 2008 and 2007, Inrix cited the Cross Bronx Expressway&#x27;s westbound exit 4B (Bronx River Parkway) as being the worst intersection in the United States. In 2008, the expressway&#x27;s exits included three out of the top four on the list, and four of the top five in 2007. Congestion is often exacerbated by the fact that large portions of the Cross Bronx Expressway does not meet modern Interstate standards, as well as the relative lack of arterial roads between the West Bronx and East Bronx. Large portions of the expressway do not have shoulders, so even minor breakdowns could cause congestion. A 2002 study by the New York State Department of Transportation found that the expressway also had short entrance and exit ramps, poor sightlines, and dim lighting. Other issues were caused by the fact that the expressway&#x27;s service roads were discontinuous, forcing traffic onto the expressway or local streets.

In 2022, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority released an environmental impact statement, which detailed the possible impacts of a planned congestion pricing zone in New York City. The study found that, if the zone were implemented, up to 700 additional trucks per day would use the Cross Bronx Expressway to avoid the congestion pricing zone. After congestion pricing was enacted in 2025, traffic on the Cross Bronx Expressway increased as well, leading to concerns that the toll would worsen already-high levels of air pollution.

<text>The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( or BfV, often &quot;Bundesverfassungsschutz&quot;) is Germany&#x27;s federal domestic intelligence agency. Together with the Landesämter für Verfassungsschutz (LfV) at the state level, the federal agency is tasked with intelligence-gathering on efforts against the liberal democratic basic order, the existence and security of the federation or one of its states, and the peaceful coexistence of peoples; with counter-intelligence; and with protective security and counter-sabotage. The BfV reports to the Federal Ministry of the Interior and tasks and powers are regulated in the Federal Constitutional Protection Act (&quot;Bundesverfassungsschutzgesetz (BVerfSchG))&quot;. The President is Thomas Haldenwang; he was appointed in 2018.

==Overview==
Together with the Federal Intelligence Service and the Military Counterintelligence Service, the BfV is one of the three federal intelligence services.

The BfV investigates efforts and activities directed against the federal level of Germany or transnational, in matters of foreign policy significance and at the request of a state authority for the protection of the constitution. The federal government has the right to issue instructions to the states in matters relating to the protection of the constitution if an attack on the “[…] constitutional order of the federation occurs.”

The BfV is overseen by the Federal Ministry of the Interior as well as the Bundestag, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information and other federal institutions. The Federal Minister of the Interior has administrative and functional control of the BfV. Parliamentary control is exercised by the Bundestag in general debate, question times and urgent inquiries, as well as by its committees, most notably the Parliamentary Oversight Panel and the . The BfV is also under judicial control and all its activities can be legally challenged in court. Based on the right of information, the general public can direct inquiries and petitions at the BfV.

The BfV does not have any police powers or authority to issue instructions. It may also not request the police, by way of administrative assistance (&quot;Amtshilfe&quot;), to take measures for which it itself is not authorized.

==Organization==

The BfV is based in Cologne. It is headed by a president (currently Thomas Haldenwang) and two vice-presidents and is organised in twelve departments:

* Department Z: Central Services
* Department TA: Technical Analysis 
* Department TX: Technical Infrastructure 
* Department C: Cyber Defence
* Department O: Surveillance
* Department S: Internal Security, Protective Security and Counter-sabotage, Supervisory and Advisory Quality Management, Internal Audit
* Department 1: Specialized Support
* Department 2: Right-wing extremism/Terrorism
* Department 3: Measures according to the G-10 act
* Department 4: Counter-espionage, and Protection Against Industrial Espionage
* Department 5: Extremism of foreigners and Left-wing extremism
* Department 6: Islamic extremism and terrorism
* AfV: Academy of the German Domestic Intelligence Services (including the MAD)
* ZNAF (Zentrum für Nachrichtendienstliche Aus- und Fortbildung): Education and Training (in cooperation with the BND)

In 2022 federal funding for the BfV was €469 million; with a total of 4,414 staff members employed.

== Task ==
General mandate: A prerequisite for warding off dangers posed by enemies of the free democratic basic order is comprehensive information of state bodies and the public about anti-constitutional efforts and developments, with the aim of defending the values of the basic order. The BfV is responsible for providing an early warning system (&quot;Frühwarnsystem&quot;).

The specific tasks of the BfV arise from § 3 of the BVerfSchG (Tasks of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution) in conjunction with § 5 of the BVerfSchG (Distinction between the federal government and the states):

=== 1. Defensive Democracy ===
One of the BfV&#x27;s main tasks is to collect and evaluate information, such as factual or personal information, news or documents about efforts directed against the free democratic basic order. It is therefore part of the concept of a defensive democracy, according to which an early warning system is set up in order to &quot;identify threats in advance of a specific danger in order to be able to react to them politically and/or legally in a timely manner.&quot;

These include political or violent activities that endanger the security or existence of the Federal Republic of Germany due to their anti-democratic attitudes or intentions, such as extreme left or right-wing parties and organizations or terrorist groups.

The Federal Police&#x27;s Center for Information and Communication Technology (&quot;Zentrum für Informations- und Kommunikationstechnik (IKTZ)&quot;) supports the BfV in the field of radio technology in accordance with § 10 of the Federal Police Act (&quot;Bundespolizeigesetz (BPolG)&quot;).

In 2008, the heads of the constitutional protection authorities specifically called for the strategic monitoring of relevant Internet exchange point such as the DE-CIX.

=== 2. Counterintelligence ===
The BfV&#x27;s legal mandate is to investigate &quot;security-endangering or intelligence-related activities [...] for a foreign power&quot; (§ 3 of the BVerfSchG), i.e. to counter espionage and sabotage within the country. To this end, the BfV investigates the activities of foreign intelligence services in order to prevent espionage activities and sabotage measures against political and public institutions (e.g. political parties or government agencies) or commercial enterprises. This also includes uncovering illegal business or the leakage of know-how that could serve to further proliferate nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.

Corresponding activities that take place abroad, however, are monitored by the Federal Intelligence Service.

Countering espionage in the area of the Bundeswehr or the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Defense (§ 1 of the Law on the Military Counterintelligence Service &quot;(Gesetz über den militärischen Abschirmdienst (MADG)&quot;) is the task of the Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD).

In the area of counter-espionage, the BfV distinguishes between A, B and C states. The A states are dealt with particularly intensively. In 2022, these included Russia, China, Turkey, Iran and North Korea. In the case of the B states, 21 in 2022, there is no permanent observation, but rather the processing of individual suspected cases. In the case of the C states, 172 in 2022, no intelligence means are used in principle. Suspected case processing is possible in every category. Even today, the BfV&#x27;s counter-espionage department deals with those former members of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) of the German Democratic Republic who continue to work in intelligence services, mostly on behalf of Russia. Since 2015, Department 4, responsible for counter-espionage, has been growing, and later responsibility for cyber defense was also placed in this department. A few weeks after the start of the Ukraine war in 2022, the office applied for an additional 50 positions for Department 4.

=== 3. Secret and economic protection ===
Another area of responsibility of the BfV is the protection of secrets and economic security. In relation to the work of the BfV, this includes regulations and instructions or recommendations that are intended to ensure the protection of classified information belonging to the state and the industry commissioned by it (protection of secrets) or of trade secret (economic security) from unauthorized access. The BfV offers publications on the Internet and advice to commercial enterprises. In addition, the BfV carries out security checks for personnel (&quot;Sicherheitsüberprüfung&quot;) in areas of commercial enterprises that are subject to secrecy. Since 2008, the information transfer between the BfV and the economy has been carried out by the Working Group for Economic Security (&quot;Allianz für Sicherheit in der Wirtschaft&quot;) in the Economic Security Department (&quot;Ressortkreis Wirtschaftsschutz&quot;).

== Objects of observation ==
In the 2018 report on the protection of the constitution, the BfV divides the politically motivated crime objects for reconnaissance and observation into the following fields:

* right-wing extremism
* left-wing extremism
* islamism and islamist terrorism
* security-threatening and extremist activities of foreigners (excluding Islamism).

Politically motivated crime (&quot;Politisch motivierte Kriminalität (PMK)&quot;) refers to and records crimes that constitute state security crimes (&quot;Staatsschutzdelikte&quot;). These include §§ 80 to 83, 84 to 91, 94 to 100a, 102 to 104a, 105 to 108e, 109 to 109h, 129a, 130, 234a and 241a of the Criminal Code (StGB).

=== Examples of politically motivated crime ===
Examples of groups of people whose individual members have been or are being interviewed or observed by the BfV and affiliated organizations are:

* People from associations associated with the right-wing extremist spectrum: Alternative für Deutschland, Der Flügel, Junge Alternative, NPD (NPD banning attempt), Junge Nationalisten, Ring Nationaler Frauen, DS-Verlag, Die Rechte, Der III. Weg, National Socialist Underground, German People&#x27;s Union, Freie Kameradschaften or those close to them
* People from parties and organizations of the left-wing extremist spectrum, including parts of the party The Left; also the Communist Party of Germany, German Communist Party, Marxist–Leninist Party of Germany, historically Red Army Faction and Free German Youth, Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist–Leninist, Freie Arbeiterinnen- und Arbeiter-Union, Anarcho-Syndicalist Union of Germany and others, as well as autonomous groups
* Islamic fundamentalist and Islamist organizations ICCB (Chaplains&#x27; Association), Millî Görüş, IS, al-Qaida (and derivatives), Hamas, Jihadism, Turkish Hezbollah, Muslim Brotherhood and others
* Persons from the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party, the Revolutionary People&#x27;s Liberation Front, Turkish right-wing extremism such as the Ülkücü movement and other extremist groups
* Cyber attack groups
* Intelligence and security services of the Russian Federation, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey and other states active in Germany
* Scientology
* Historcially refugees from the Eastern Bloc, as Eastern secret services placed agents among the people who emigrated from the GDR by applying for an exit permit infiltrated, among other things, for the purpose of spying on Western secret holders (Günter Guillaume).
* Historicially politicians of the former GDR and other socialist states (wiretapping operations, analyses).

== Activity and methodology ==

The primary purpose of intelligence gathering is to inform the federal and state governments as well as the public, who must then draw political conclusions from the findings.

The prerequisite for surveillance by the BfV is the existence of actual evidence. This determination can be checked by the person being observed in court. In order to establish the basis for surveillance in a way that is legally binding, the BfV must have the opportunity to carry out an investigation. This can only be done by evaluating publicly accessible sources, which is not yet relevant to fundamental rights in the case of public communication content. At this stage, the BfV refers to a test case (&quot;Prüffall&quot;).

If the investigation reveals suspicion of anti-constitutional activities, the BfV initiates a suspected case (&quot;Verdachtsfall&quot;). The BfV is now allowed to collect personal data and carry out investigations using individual intelligence means. This includes in particular the use of observers who specifically attend events. Undercover employees or communication surveillance are not permitted in this case unless other requirements are met.

The BfV, together with the state authorities for the protection of the constitution, uses a computer system called NADIS to store personal data.

While the BfV uses all kinds of surveillance technology and infiltration, they mostly use open sources. The BfV publishes a yearly report (&quot;Verfassungsschutzbericht&quot;) which is intended to raise awareness about anti-constitutional activities.

=== Open-source intelligence ===
The BfV obtains most of its information from open-sources such as newspapers, television, the Internet, leaflets and the like. In addition, employees attend public information events run by monitored organizations.

=== Intelligence resources ===
According to § 8 of the BVerfSchG, the BfV is permitted to use intelligence means (&quot;Nachrichtendienstliche Mittel (nd-Mittel)&quot;). For example, the BfV obtains information from informants (&quot;Vertrauenspersonen&quot;) who move in extremist or terrorist circles. Recruiting informants in right-wing extremism is considered easier because they often have financial problems, want to be considered important and tend to have a positive attitude towards the state. Left-wing extremists, on the other hand, are more ideologically stable and reject state institutions.

The BfV is permitted to conduct observations, make secret image and sound recordings and use cover plates (&quot;Tarnkennzeichen&quot;) and cover papers (&quot;Tarnpapiere&quot;).

The BfV is also authorized to monitor mail and telecommunications (&quot;Brief- und Telekommunikationsüberwachung,&quot; recording telephone conversations, internet and other data transmissions, mobile phone cell queries). When carrying out these actions, however, it is bound by the Act on Restrictions on the Secrecy of Mail, Post and Telecommunications (G-10 Act; &quot;Gesetz zur Beschränkung des Brief‑, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses&quot;). The monitoring of bundled telecommunications (&quot;gebündelte Telekommunikation&quot;; e.g. via satellite or in internet exchange point) is reserved for the Federal Intelligence Service according to § 5 G-10 Act.

The BfV uses virtual agents who use various profiles in social networks to try to obtain information and infiltrate groups.

In counter-espionage, all intelligence means are used, including the use of double agents, who are called &quot;countermen&quot; in the BfV, as well as undercover employees according to § 9a BVerfSchG, who are also called &quot;undercover agents (UCA)&quot; within the BfV.

==== &quot;Online-Durchsuchung&quot; ====
&quot;Online-Durchsuchung&quot; means that authorities access the hard drive of a person&#x27;s computer using software installed while using the Internet, a so-called Trojan horse (also known as a Federal trojan horse (&quot;Bundestrojaner&quot;) in Germany). The data stored on the hard drive is transmitted to the authorities secretly and over a longer period of time. The BfV does not provide the public with any information on the practice of &quot;Online-Durchsuchungen&quot;. Whether &quot;Online-Durchsuchungen&quot; by authorities are generally permissible is controversial.

==== Cooperation with other intelligence services ====
The BfV works with domestic and foreign intelligence services. In at least one case, the BfV has turned to US authorities for help in unmasking a US spy. The spy was from the NSA, who was spying on the German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal (&quot;1. Untersuchungsausschuss „NSA“)&quot;.

== Personnel, Recruitment and Training ==
The BfV employed civil servants. As in the rest of the federal service, the careers for civil servants are divided into simple, middle, upper and higher service. All employees must go through an extended security check with security investigations before they can work in the BfV. It&#x27;s the highest security check in Germany. The BfV trains its staff for the middle and higher service itself, together with the BND.

=== Middle-Service ===
For the Middle-Service () the training conveys the theoretical knowledge and methods as well as the practical professional knowledge and skills that are required for the fulfillment of the tasks in the middle service in the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. In addition, the training should enable the candidates to act responsibly in a liberal, democratic and social constitutional state. This also includes the ability to recognize and classify potential dangers for the security of the Federal Republic of Germany in a national and international context.

The subject areas of the theoretical training are operational procurement and observation, operational information analysis, state and constitutional law, criminal law, laws on the intelligence services and other laws relating to intelligence services, international politics and forms of political extremism, security fields relating to intelligence services, in particular self-security, Counter-espionage, intelligence-psychology, foreign language training as well as household, cash and accounting. The training takes place at both the ZNAF and the AfV.

=== Upper-Service ===
In a close connection between science and practice, the upper-service conveys the scientific methods and knowledge as well as the practical professional skills and knowledge that are required for the fulfillment of the tasks in the higher service in the federal constitution protection. In addition, it lays the foundation for a cross-agency knowledge and method base. The course is intended to promote cooperation between the intelligence services and contribute to the standardization of intelligence work.

In the basic course, legal, constitutional, political, business, economic, financial and social science fundamentals of administrative action are taught, as well as organization and information processing. Topics of the main course are operational procurement and observation, intelligence service information evaluation, state, administrative, criminal, international and European law, international politics and the history of political ideas as well as forms of political extremism, internal security, counter-espionage, intelligence-psychology, foreign language training and intelligence service relevant topics from business and technology. A thesis has to be written during the preparatory service. The training takes place at both the ZNAF and the AfV.

=== Higher-Service ===
Above all, the BfV offers fully qualified lawyers entry into the higher non-technical administrative service as a junior executive with direct employment as a civil servant.

==History==
An indirect predecessor of the federal office existed already in the Weimar Republic from 1920 to 1929, the .

In the course of drafting the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany the military governors of the Trizone outlined the competences of federal police and intelligence ( of 14 April 1949). In accordance with this outline the BfV was established on 7 November 1950. At first the BfV was mostly concerned with Neo-Nazism and communist revolutionary activities. Soon the BfV also became involved in counter-espionage.

From the beginning, the BfV was troubled by a number of affairs. First, in the &quot;Vulkan&quot; affair in April 1953, 44 suspects were arrested and charged with spying on behalf of East Germany (GDR), but were later released as the information provided by the BfV was insufficient to obtain court verdicts. Then, in 1954 the first president of the BfV, Otto John, fled to the GDR. Shortly after that it became public that a number of employees of the BfV had been with the Gestapo during the Third Reich. Nevertheless, material on the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was essential for banning the party by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in August 1956. Over the years, a number of associations and political groups were banned on the basis of materials provided by the BfV.

In 1965, the Brown Book exposed that a large number of BfV officers had previously held prominent positions in Nazi Germany. Initially dismissed as &quot;Communist propaganda&quot;, subsequent historical research confirmed its accuracy to be up to 99%. For instance, their head from 1955 to 1972, , had been a member of the SA, a Nazi judicial prosecutor involved in cases against racially and politically persecuted individuals who were later murdered in Auschwitz, and an SS executioner in occupied France.

Since 1972 the BfV is also concerned with activities of foreign nationals in Germany, especially extremists and terrorists who operate in the country or plan their activities there, such as the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party. One of the major intelligence failures in this field were the riots by supporters of the PKK in 1998, which the BfV missed due to the Cologne carnival.

The counter-intelligence activities of the BfV were mostly directed against the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi), another employer of ex-Gestapo agents. The MfS successfully penetrated the BfV and in a number of affairs destroyed its reputation as a counter-intelligence service by the early 1980s. In this, the MfS profited from the West German border regime which allowed any GDR citizen into the Federal Republic without restrictions.

From 1992 to 2006, the BfV was monitoring The Republicans party.

==Criticism==
The BfV has responsibility for combatting terrorism in Germany. It has drawn harsh criticism for its role in several bungled counterterrorism operations.

Shortly after German reunification, an undercover BfV agent named Klaus Steinmetz successfully infiltrated the Red Army Faction (RAF), the Far Left terrorist organization founded by Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, and Gudrun Ensslin. As a result, Third Generation RAF leaders Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams were to be taken into custody by German law enforcement at the railway station at Bad Kleinen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on 27 June 1993. Instead, both Wolfgang Grams and GSG 9 police officer Michael Newrzella died during an ensuing gunfight. Due to a number of easily preventable mistakes involving the BfV and the various police services involved in the operation, Germany&#x27;s Federal Minister of the Interior, Rudolf Seiters, took full responsibility and resigned from his post.

The even more preventable failure of the BfV to even detect the activities of the 9/11 conspirators in Hamburg has similarly raised questions about their competence. The rise of far right extremism in the former GDR has also been partly blamed on the BfV&#x27;s failure to establish working structures there.

The agency was heavily criticised for the destruction of files related to the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi domestic terrorist organization. The ensuing scandal led to the resignation of BfV president Heinz Fromm in 2012.

The agency has also been criticised for its lack of action against crimes and terrorism acts committed by illegal immigrants and far left groups.

<doc id="1005101" wikidata="Q5333376" url="?curid=1005101" title="Economic Faculty Association Rotterdam">
<text>Established in 1925, the Economic Faculty association Rotterdam (EFR) has over 7000 members making it one of the biggest, oldest, and most active faculty associations in Europe. 
It belongs to the Erasmus School of Economics, a faculty of the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

EFR sets objectives for the students by filling the gap between theory and practice. They do this by organising a large number of activities. One of their most popular activities is the EFR Inspiration Days, one of the most prestigious and professional student conferences in Western Europe.

==History==
EFR was established on 14 March 1925, when the Association for Student Interests (VVS) was founded to represent the students of the Netherlands School of Commerce.

In the forty years that followed, the VVS has served students by being the bridge between students and professors, representing student interests and organizing guest lectures, with notable speakers like professor Joseph Schumpeter in 1925/1926. From September 1939, the Netherlands School of Commerce was renamed to the Netherlands School of Economics and the VVS continued to serve its students. On 11 November 1964 the members of the general member meeting decided to rename the association to the &quot;Economic Faculty association Rotterdam&quot;.

As from 1969, a new concept was introduced called colleges. The &quot;disputen&quot; had been intended especially for the progressed students who kept themselves busy with their main subjects. Later some of these colleges split off from the main association forming their own associations, these include; Faector (econometrics), JFR (law), Aeclipse (policy economics master students) and a few more.
In the academic year 1977/1978, EFR-Bulletin was published for the first time; a communication booklet was distributed after the lectures. In the following year EFR-Courant was introduced. Later the booklet took the form of the magazine &quot;Eclaire&quot;. The magazine was published five times a year and 6000 issues were distributed among students and business associates. Some special editions, for the Business Week for example, were sent out to all economics students in the Netherlands. The last edition of the Eclair was published in 2014, in 2019 a special lustrum edition was created but this was never formally published.

The governing board of the academic year 1980/1981, a congress took place with the subject of &quot;America&quot;, which became known as the so-called showpiece of EFR. Later, the board of 1984/1985 named the same event the &quot;EFR-Business Week&quot;, starting a very long tradition. Every year The business week would take place, hosting a variety of well known speakers and big companies. In the spring of 2019 the last edition of the EFR Business Week took place, and was subsequently followed in the winter by the first edition of the EFR Master Career Week, and the EFR Inspiration Days in 2020. The Master Career Week was set up to replace the recruitment part of the Business Week, while the Inspiration Days was meant replace the inspirational and orientational part of the Business Week.

In 1996 the first EFR World Leader Cycle award was awarded to Michail Gorbachev in 1996 for &#x27;his efforts to reform policies within the party and his actions which helped end the Cold War.&#x27;. Ever since it has been the case that every few years prominent leaders that stood out because of their actions in the field of politics or society are being considered for the award. The World Leader Cycle award is presented by EFR on behalf of both students and the faculty. Among past winners are many influential politicians and other world leaders such as John Nash Jr., Ban Ki-moon, and François Hollande.

==Erasmus Recruitment==
Together with Faculty Association STAR, EFR co-owns Erasmus Recruitment the largest campus recruitment platform in Europe. Erasmus Recruitment is a concept of its own, with both a recruitment platform, as well as the biggest on-campus Recruitment event of Europe, the Erasmus Recruitment Days. In 2016 there were approximately 2800 participating students and more than 115 companies present.

==Master Career Week==
The EFR Master Career Week, first took place in 2019, succeeding the immensely popular Business Week. The event consists of ‘branch bootcamps’ during which students will vitis four companies of a specified branch over the course of two days, getting an exclusive look into these companies’ way of conducting business. During these visits, students get the chance to experience these companies’ cultures and connect with their people on a personal level. The bootcamps are usually a blend of formal and informal activities containing both Workshops as well as dinners and fun activities.

==Other projects==
One of the international activities of EFR is the Involve consultancy project. This is a project where 20 students work together with an NGO abroad to investigate and improve a problem facing society.

Together with EenVandaag EFR organises the EFR EenVandaag election debate. This collaboration came about in the run-up to the 2002 elections and resulted in the first debate on 21 March 2002. The debate was held in the auditorium of Erasmus University Rotterdam. Thanks to the participation of Pim Fortuyn, this debate has probably been the most striking of the series.

<text>Jerome Najee Rasheed (born November 4, 1957, New York City), known professionally as Najee, is an American jazz saxophonist and flautist.

==Early life==
Najee was born in the lower west side of Manhattan in New York City and lived his teenage years in Queens, New York. His father died at a young age, and Najee and siblings were raised by his mother Mary Richards. His mother was an important figure and supporter throughout his life and musical career.

Najee&#x27;s musical pursuits began in grade school at age eight, where he began playing the clarinet, but he had a deep desire to play saxophone. He was influenced at this age by listening to his mother&#x27;s recordings of Miles Davis and other American jazz artists. A pivotal moment in his life came when he made the decision to become a professional jazz musician. In high school, Najee began to study jazz as a student at the Jazzmobile program (co-founded by Dr. Billy Taylor) where he honed his skills on tenor saxophone and flute under the direction of Jimmy Heath, Frank Foster and Ernie Wilkins. At age 16, Najee studied flute at the Manhattan School of Music Preparatory Division, where he took lessons with Harold Jones, flautist from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

Najee draws his inspiration from saxophonists John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Yusef Lateef, Joe Henderson, Grover Washington Jr., Ronnie Laws as well as flautists Hubert Laws and James Galway. Najee began his career as a teenager performing in local bands in the New York City area. After high school, Najee&#x27;s first world tour was with a band from New York City called &quot;Area Code&quot;.

The band spent two years performing on military bases in Europe, Iceland, Greenland, Central America, Caribbean, and the United States on behalf of the USO. Upon his return from the USO World Tour, Najee went on the road in the summer of 1978 with Ben E. King. After touring with Ben E. King, Najee and his brother Fareed attended New York City&#x27;s Bronx Community College for two semesters. Both were music majors under the tutelage of Valerie Capers. The following year both brothers auditioned and were admitted to the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Najee was a performance and composition major. He also studied with Joe Allard (1st clarinetist for Toscanini). At the Conservatory Najee studied and performed with George Russell and Jaki Byard big bands.

==Career==

After his studies at the New England Conservatory, Najee returned to New York City in the early 1980s. In 1983, he and his brother Fareed toured with Chaka Khan for the Ain&#x27;t Nobody Tour. In 1986, he released his debut album, entitled &quot;Najee&#x27;s Theme&quot; (EMI/Capitol). The album earned Najee a Grammy Award Nomination for Best Jazz Album. In 1987, Najee accepted an opportunity to open on the &quot;Tasty Love&quot; tour with R&amp;B singer Freddie Jackson. In 1988, Najee&#x27;s second album &quot;Day by Day&quot; was released and certified gold. &quot;Day by Day&quot; was produced by several producers including producer Barry Eastmond (Freddie Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Anita Baker and Billy Ocean). In 1990, &quot;Tokyo Blue&quot; was released. This album was produced by Najee&#x27;s brother Fareed, and is one of his most successful recordings to date. &quot;Tokyo Blue&quot; and &quot;Day by Day&quot; led to Najee winning two Soul Train Awards for Best Jazz Artist in 1991 and 1993.

In 1992, Najee&#x27;s next album &quot;Just an Illusion&quot; (EMI/Capitol). This album was produced by several producers, including Arif Mardin, George Duke, Fareed, Marcus Miller and Wayne Brathwaite. In 1994, Najee toured and was featured on the live recording &quot;Live at the Greek&quot; (Sony). The album featured Najee, Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham and Larry Carlton. It was during this time that he made guest appearances with Quincy Jones at the Montreaux Jazz Festival.

Following this collaboration, his next album &quot;Share My World&quot; was released in 1994 and was followed by his tribute to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1976 classic, Songs in the Key of Life in 1995. The CD was produced by George Duke and features Herbie Hancock, Stanley Clarke, Paul Jackson Jr., Sheila E. and Patrice Rushen among others. His CD &quot;Morning Tenderness&quot; was released in 1998, and went to number 1 on the contemporary jazz charts. Also within the same year &quot;The Best of Najee&quot; was released, (Blue Note Records/Capitol) and he once again toured on behalf of the USO for the troops in the Mediterranean: Spain and Turkey.

In 1998, Najee performed at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s birthday celebration in South Africa, along with Stevie Wonder and Chaka Khan. Najee was also a special guest of President Bill Clinton to perform at the White House. This event was hosted by President Jerry Rawlings of the Republic of Ghana. Najee spent three years touring (2000–2003) with Prince and appeared on Prince&#x27;s albums &quot;Rainbow Children&quot; and &quot;One Night Alone&quot;.

In 2003, Najee released &quot;Embrace&quot; which was produced by his brother Fareed, featuring guest artists Roy Ayers and BeBe Winans. &quot;My Point of View&quot; was his follow-up in 2005 featuring vocalist Will Downing. In 2006, Najee won an NAACP Image Award for &quot;Best Jazz Artist&quot;. His 2007 album &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, featured singer Phil Perry. In 2009, he released &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot;, with a collaboration that featured vocalist Eric Benét and producer Jeff Lorber.

The video for &quot;Just to Fall in Love&quot; also features actress Vanessa Bell Calloway and songstress N&#x27;dambi.

Najee&#x27;s second release with Shanachie in 2013, &quot;The Morning After, A Musical Love Journey&quot;. &quot;The Morning After&quot; earned him an NAACP Image Award Nomination for &quot;Outstanding Jazz Album&quot; (2014) and a Soul Train Awards Nomination for &quot;Best Contemporary Jazz Performance&quot; (2014). The album produced by Demonte Posey, features R&amp;B singer Meli&#x27;sa Morgan and bassist Brian Bromberg, with musicians Bill Sharpe on bass, Ray Fuller on guitar, Daniel Powell on drums, Nick Smith on piano and drummer Joel Taylor.

<doc id="1005128" wikidata="Q1622830" url="?curid=1005128" title="Wave soldering">
<text>Wave soldering is a bulk soldering process used in printed circuit board manufacturing. The circuit board is passed over a pan of molten solder in which a pump produces an upwelling of solder that looks like a standing wave. As the circuit board makes contact with this wave, the components become soldered to the board. Wave soldering is used for both through-hole printed circuit assemblies, and surface mount. In the latter case, the components are glued onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) by placement equipment, before being run through the molten solder wave. Wave soldering is mainly used in soldering of through hole components.

As through-hole components have been largely replaced by surface mount components, wave soldering has been supplanted by reflow soldering methods in many large-scale electronics applications. However, there is still significant wave soldering where surface-mount technology (SMT) is not suitable (e.g., large power devices and high pin count connectors), or where simple through-hole technology prevails (certain major appliances).

==Wave solder process==
There are many types of wave solder machines; however, the basic components and principles of these machines are the same. The basic equipment used during the process is a conveyor that moves the PCB through the different zones, a pan of solder used in the soldering process, a pump that produces the actual wave, the sprayer for the flux and the preheating pad. The solder is usually a mixture of metals. A typical leaded solder is composed of 50% tin, 49.5% lead, and 0.5% antimony. The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) has led to an ongoing transition away from &#x27;traditional&#x27; leaded solder in modern manufacturing in favor of lead-free alternatives. Both tin-silver-copper and tin-copper-nickel alloys are commonly used, with one common alloy (SN100C) being 99.25% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel and &lt;0.01% germanium.

==Fluxing==
Flux in the wave soldering process has a primary and a secondary objective. The primary objective is to clean the components that are to be soldered, principally any oxide layers that may have formed. There are two types of flux, corrosive and noncorrosive. Noncorrosive flux requires precleaning and is used when low acidity is required. Corrosive flux is quick and requires little precleaning, but has a higher acidity.

==Preheating==
Preheating helps to accelerate the soldering process and to prevent thermal shock.

==Cleaning==
Some types of flux, called &quot;no-clean&quot; fluxes, do not require cleaning; their residues are benign after the soldering process. Typically no-clean fluxes are especially sensitive to process conditions, which may make them undesirable in some applications. Other kinds of flux, however, require a cleaning stage, in which the PCB is washed with solvents and/or deionized water to remove flux residue.

==Finish and quality==
Quality depends on proper temperatures when heating and on properly treated surfaces.
==Solder types==
Different combinations of tin, lead and other metals are used to create solder. The combinations used depend on the desired properties. The most popular combinations are SAC (Tin(Sn)/Silver(Ag)/Copper(Cu)) alloys for lead-free processes and Sn63Pb37 (Sn63A) which is a eutectic alloy consisting of 63% tin and 37% lead. This latter combination is strong, has a low melting range, and melts and sets quickly (i.e., no &#x27;plastic&#x27; range between the solid and molten states like the older 60% tin / 40% lead alloy). Higher tin compositions give the solder higher corrosion resistances, but raise the melting point. Another common composition is 11% tin, 37% lead, 42% bismuth, and 10% cadmium. This combination has a low melting point and is useful for soldering components that are sensitive to heat.
Environmental and performance requirements also factor into alloy selection. Common restrictions include restrictions on lead (Pb) when RoHS compliance is required and restrictions on pure tin (Sn) when long term reliability is a concern.

==Effects of cooling rate==
It is important that the PCBs be allowed to cool at a reasonable rate. If they are cooled too fast, then the PCB can become warped and the solder can be compromised. On the other hand, if the PCB is allowed to cool too slowly, then the PCB can become brittle and some components may be damaged by heat. The PCB should be cooled by either a fine water spray or air cooled to decrease the amount of damage to the board.

==Thermal profiling==
Thermal profiling is the act of measuring several points on a circuit board to determine the thermal excursion it takes through the soldering process.
In the electronics manufacturing industry, SPC (Statistical Process Control) helps determine if the process is in control, measured against the reflow parameters defined by the soldering technologies and component requirements.
Products like the Solderstar WaveShuttle and the Optiminer have been developed special fixtures which are passed through the process and can measure the temperature profile, along with contact times, wave parallelism and wave heights. These fixture combined with analysis software allows the production engineer to establish and then control the wave solder process.

==Solder wave height==
The height of the solder wave is a key parameter that needs to be evaluated when setting up the wave solder process. The contact time between the solder wave and assembly being soldered is typically set to between 2 and 4 seconds. This contact time is controlled by two parameters on the machine, conveyor speed and wave height, changes to either of these parameters will result in a change in contact time. The wave height is typically controlled by increasing or decreasing the pump speed on the machine. Changes can be evaluated and checked using a tempered glass plate, if more detailed recording are required fixture are available which digitally record the contact times, height and speed. Also, some wave solder machines can give the operator a choice between a smooth laminar wave or a slightly higher-pressure &#x27;dancer&#x27; wave.

<doc id="1005131" wikidata="Q509242" url="?curid=1005131" title="Rick Braun">
<text>Rick Braun (born July 6, 1955) is an American smooth jazz trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone and keyboards player, vocalist, composer, and record producer.

==Early life and education==
Braun was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania and attended Dieruff High School. His mother was a self-taught pianist and banjoist. Braun played drums at Dieruff High School, and followed his brother in playing trumpet. 

In the 1970s, while attending the Eastman School of Music, he became a member of a jazz-fusion band, Auracle, along with, amongst others, keyboards player John Serry, saxophone and flute player Steve Kujala and vibes player Steve Rehbein (later Steve Raybine). The band worked with producer Teo Macero and Braun co-produced the second album City Slickers (minus John Serry and Steve Kujala).

==Career==
In the 1980s, Braun entered the pop music world, releasing an album in Japan as a singer. He then worked as a songwriter for Lorimar, writing the song &quot;Here with Me&quot; with REO Speedwagon which became a top twenty hit, and the theme for Lorimar&#x27;s NBC show Midnight Caller. When he returned to the trumpet, he worked as a studio musician and touring member with Crowded House, Natalie Cole, Glenn Frey, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, Tom Petty, Sade, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, and War.

In 1992, he released his debut solo album, &quot;Intimate Secrets&quot; (Mesa), followed in 1994 by two solo albums, &quot;Night Walk&quot; and &quot;Christmas Present&quot;. The former featured him playing just muted trumpet and flugelhorn. His popularity increased enough by 1995, when he released &quot;Beat Street&quot;, that he was persuaded to pursue a solo career.

He has cited as influences Miles Davis, Lee Morgan, Chet Baker, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, and Herb Alpert. He cites Herb Alpert with inspiring his album &quot;All It Takes&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Tijuana Dance&quot;, a play on Alpert&#x27;s band Tijuana Brass. One of his influences was Freddie Hubbard, and Braun composed a song, &quot;Freddie Was Here&quot; in 2008, which he recorded on his album, &quot;All it Takes&quot;, in tribute to Hubbard, who died that year.

He achieved several top chartings including &quot;Kisses in the Rain&quot; (as high as number 1), &quot;R n R&quot; (as high as number 1), &quot;All It Takes&quot; (as high as number 2), and &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; (as high as number 1) along with charting at the Traditional Jazz Albums for the first time in 2011 with the vocal album &quot;Sings with Strings&quot; (as high as number 9).

Braun performs in the band BWB, with saxophonist Kirk Whalum and guitarist Norman Brown. He has performed live with known musicians such as Candy Dulfer, Dave Koz, Jackiem Joyner, and Peter White.

In 2005, he and saxophonist Richard Elliot co-founded ARTizen Music Group, now known as Artistry Music, and once had Rykodisc as a distributor.

Braun has twice been named &quot;Gavin Report&quot;″s &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;.

<text>Leopold I (F930) is a of the Marine Component of the Belgian Armed Forces. Prior to 29 March 2007, the ship was known as HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; (F827). It is one of the two frigates of this class purchased from the Royal Netherlands Navy on 22 December 2005.

==HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot;==

HNLMS &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was the first ship of the of multi-purpose frigates (also known as &quot;M-fregat&quot; class). She was the third ship in the Royal Netherlands Navy to be named after Admiral Karel Doorman, who was killed during the Battle of the Java Sea. The ship was laid down on 26 February 1985, launched on 20 April 1988 and commissioned on 31 May 1991.

She took part in anti-drug operations in the Caribbean together with the US Navy, was part of the UN operations in the Adriatic Sea during the conflicts in the former republics of Yugoslavia, as well as various NATO exercises.

==&quot;Leopold I&quot;==

On 20 July 2005, the Belgian government decided to buy two of the remaining six Dutch M-class frigates to replace the two remaining frigates of the (&quot;Wielingen&quot; and &quot;Westdiep&quot;) then in service with the Belgian Naval Component. On 22 December 2005, &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; and &quot;Willem van der Zaan&quot; were sold to Belgium.

&quot;Karel Doorman&quot; was taken out of service in 2006 and turned over to the Belgian Marine Component on 29 March 2007 where the ship was christened &quot;Leopold I&quot;, in honour of the first King of the Belgians, by Queen Fabiola of Belgium at Zeebrugge Marine Base. The patronage of &quot;Leopold I&quot; was accepted by the city of Nivelles. &quot;Willem van der Zaan&quot; was commissioned into the Belgian Marine Component as in April 2008.

===East African deployment===
&quot;Leopold I&quot; embarked upon her first official mission for the Naval Component on 5 September 2007. She was deployed to East Africa as part of the international mission against Somali pirates. The operation was given the codename &quot;East African Venture&quot;. On 30 November 2007 she arrived back at her home port of Zeebrugge, marking the end of the deployment.

=== Fight against ISIL ===

In November 2015, a French Navy press release stated that &quot;Leopold I&quot; would be part of the task force launching strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Her deployment took place from 18 November 2015 to 4 January 2016.

=== Coronavirus pandemic ===
Belgian Defense announced on 25 March 2020 that a crew member had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The sailor had been evacuated via air to Den Helder on 20 March 2020 after he began showing symptoms, and was quarantined at home when the test returned positive on 24 March. As a precaution, the ship broke off from its operation with the French carrier battle group led by &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; and returned to Zeebrugge on 27 March 2020, about a month earlier than planned.

<text>Brandy de Jerez is a brandy that is matured in a solera system in the Jerez area of Andalusia, Spain. Besides being sold as a brandy, it is also an ingredient of some sherries. It has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), being matured exclusively within the &quot;Sherry Triangle&quot;, the municipal boundaries of Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in the province of Cádiz.

== History ==

Being unable to drink the already famous wines to be found in the Jerez region for religious reasons, the Moors opted to distil them in order to obtain “alcohol” not only to make perfumes but also for antiseptic and medicinal use. When wine spirits began to be aged in oak-wood casks in order to produce brandy is unknown. However, by the sixteenth century sufficient wine spirit was being produced that levies on its manufacture could be dedicated to public works, as in the Town Council of Jerez handing over the revenue from its municipal Wine Spirit Tax to the Church in 1580 for the construction of a Jesuit college.

The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the consolidation in Spain of the production of wine spirit for commercial use destined for exportation, especially to countries in Northern Europe. The Netherlands were the main market and from there shipped on to practically the whole world.

Brandy is an English adaptation of the original Dutch word “brandewijn” (burnt wine) whilst the term holanda (name given to wine spirits of low alcoholic content used in the production of Brandy de Jerez) is derived from the name of the country to which most of the exports were destined: Holland. The term &#x27;brandavin&#x27; was already in use in picaresque literature of the 17th Century, as can be seen in “The Life and Works of Estebanillo González, man of good humour”. In the early 19th century English and French merchants began to arrive in Jerez and, together with Spanish traders with clear commercial instincts, promoted trade and laid down the guidelines for the characteristic production and ageing process of Brandy de Jerez.

The creation of brand names for Brandy de Jerez occurred during the 19th Century on the initiative of sherry firms who were pioneers in the sale of brands which still exist today, not only in Spain but in numerous countries throughout the world.

==Production==

&quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; uses two different types of distillation equipment, both made of copper:

# the traditional pot still which in Jerez is called an &quot;alquitara&quot; – introduced by the Moors - made of copper and heated directly by a holm-oak wood fire using a discontinuous process (loading and unloading). These are used to obtain spirits of low alcoholic content, between 40° and 70°. &quot;Holandas&quot; is the term used in Jerez to refer to these wine spirits low in alcoholic content, which are of greater quality as they require the distillation of the best of wines and better evoke the raw material from which they are produced.
# distillation columns which are more modern and efficient into which the wine is introduced continuously. These columns are used in order to obtain strengths of between 70° and 94.8°.

In the case of &quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; double distillation is not required. From a simple distillation wine spirits of 65% by volume are obtained. The more a wine is distilled, the more of its characteristics and aromatic substances are lost.

The traditional production method of &quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; is controlled by the &quot;Consejo Regulador del Brandy de Jerez&quot; (the Brandy de Jerez Regulatory Council). The method has three main characteristics:
# The brandy must have been produced exclusively within the municipal boundaries of Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Sanlúcar de Barrameda.
# It must be aged in American oak casks with a capacity of 500 liters that previously contained sherry. Different types of sherry give the brandy a slightly different flavor.
# The traditional aging system of criaderas y soleras must be used.

In Jerez it is also possible to use wine spirits of a higher degree of alcoholic content, but never (by decree of the &quot;Consejo&quot;) more than 50% of the total. The &quot;holandas&quot; must always represent 50% minimum of the final brandy.

==Classification of Brandy de Jerez==
The Brandy de Jerez Regulatory Council classifies brandy de Jerez according to age:
* &quot;Brandy de Jerez Solera&quot; — Is the youngest, with a minimum average age of 6 months and a volatile content greater than 150 mg. per 100 cc. pure alcohol
* &quot;Brandy de Jerez Solera Reserva&quot; — With a minimum average maturation period of 1 year and a total content of volatile components of 200 mg. per 100 cc. of pure alcohol.
* &quot;Brandy de Jerez Solera Gran Reserva&quot; — Is the longer aging, with a minimum average of 3 years and a total content of volatile components of 250 mg. per 100 cc. of pure alcohol.

==Tourism==
&quot;Enotourism&quot; is a quite new kind of tourism that looks for places where wines and distilled beverages are produced. Recently the Route of Sherry Wine and &quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; has been established.

==&quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; in Spanish cuisine==
&quot;Brandy de Jerez&quot; is being used in Spanish cuisine in recent years, especially with meats.

<text>Ashcott is a small village and civil parish located in the Sedgemoor area of Somerset in the south-west of England. The village has a population of 1,186. The parish includes the hamlets of Ashcott Corner, Berhill, Buscott, Nythe and Pedwell.

The village has five pubs and its own brewer, Moor Beer. It has a church, shop, a primary school and an all-through independent school.

The annual Ashcott BeerFest is held on the Coronation playing fields at the end of June/beginning of July each year. It raises money for the Playing Fields, Cheeky Chimps Pre-School and the Ashcott Primary School PTA.

==History==

The parish of Ashcott was part of the Whitley Hundred.

The village was a stop for mail coaches running from Bath to Exeter, and later had a station on the Evercreech Junction to Burnham-on-Sea branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The station was two miles away from the village, and was originally called &quot;Ashcott and Meare&quot;, reflecting the fact that Meare was also nearby (in fact, nearer). &quot;Meare&quot; was dropped from the official name in 1876, though the station &quot;running board&quot; – the large sign on the platform – continued to give the double name until the railway line closed in 1966 under the Beeching Axe.

A narrow gauge railway operated by Eclipse Peat operated from 1922 to 1983 and crossed the branch line on the level about 1/2-mile east of Ashcott station. On 29 August 1949 a train on the branch collided with a narrow gauge engine and the locomotive ended up in the adjacent Glastonbury Canal.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District.

The village is part of &#x27;East Polden&#x27; electoral ward. Although Ashcott is the most populous area the ward stretches to Moorlinch and Shapwick. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 2,130.

It is also part of the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Religious sites==
The Anglican parish Church of All Saints dates from the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

==Notable residents==

Ashcott was the birthplace of Joseph Trutch, a Canadian engineer, surveyor and politician. It is also the home to Bradley Middleton, former professional footballer and founder of The Levels School.

<text>The Shopping City Süd (SCS) is a shopping centre located in Vösendorf and Wiener Neudorf, south of Vienna, Austria.

With a leasable area of , it is the biggest shopping mall in Austria. It contains over 330 shops and has around 5,000 employees (2016).

In December 2007, the SCS was sold for €607 million to French real estate company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which also owns the Donau Zentrum.

== History ==
The Shopping City Süd was built outside the borders of Vienna to save costs. As a result, a lot of purchasing power flows from Vienna to Lower Austria. 

Since 2011, the SCS has also been a member of the and aims to reduce its emissions by 5,300 tonnes as part of its membership.

After the death of the founder Hans Dujsik, the SCS was transferred to a foundation. In December 2007, the SCS was sold to the Dutch real estate group Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which also owns the Donauzentrum in Vienna. The purchase price, which was initially kept secret, is believed to have been 607 million euros, according to the Austrian Textile Newspaper. In 2021&quot;, Crédit Agricole Assurances&quot;, the insurance subsidiary of the French banking group Crédit Agricole, acquired 45% of the SCS.

The name &quot;Shopping City Süd&quot; was changed to &quot;Westfield Shopping City Süd&quot; in September 2021.

== Stores ==
The Shopping City South comprises around 330 shops with 4,500 employees. It was primarily designed for car traffic when it was built and offers more than 10,000 parking spaces.

== Facts ==

* Opened 22 September 1976
* The first IKEA store in Austria (IKEA Vösendorf) opened at SCS in 1977
* Complete renovation and rebranding in 2012

== Access ==
The light rail station Vösendorf SCS of the Badner Bahn is located right in front of SCS. In addition, SCS is located just beside the junction of the Süd Autobahn (A2) and the Wiener Neustädter Straße (B17).

Public transport is mainly provided by the Badner Bahn, but there are also a few bus lines, such as a direct connection from Vienna, Siebenhirten (U6)–SCS (&quot;SCS bus&quot;), which can be used free of charge by those travelling from outside Vienna, and the regional bus lines 207 (towards Mödling station (S-Bahn) or Siebenhirten underground station (U6) and Vienna Liesing station (S-Bahn)) and 265 (towards Mödling station (S-Bahn) or Vienna Südtiroler Platz (Vienna main station, S-Bahn, underground station U1)).

The free bus line Oper–SCS (&quot;Ikea bus&quot;) has been discontinued; since 2 October 2012, holders of the SCS customer card can use the Badner Bahn from Vienna without a ticket for the section Vösendorf-Siebenhirten–Vösendorf-SCS (outer zone).

There have been repeated calls to extend the U6 line to the SCS since 2007.

<text>Jacqueville () is a coastal town in southern Ivory Coast. It is a sub-prefecture of and the seat of Jacqueville Department in Grands-Ponts Region, Lagunes District. Jacqueville is also a commune. The town is 40 kilometres west of Abidjan.

Jacqueville is so named because it was the first place in Ivory Coast where the Union Jack was raised when the British originally occupied the country. It grew as a French colonial slave port, but is now primarily a fishing port and seaside resort.

Jacqueville is virtually an island, separated from most of the country by the Ébrié Lagoon, its other shore being on the Gulf of Guinea. Until March 2015, when a 776-metre bridge was opened, the only way to reach the island involved taking a ferry across the lagoon.

Jacqueville is noteworthy for the local pineapples (&quot;ananas sauvage&quot;), which are long narrow and have completely white and very sweet flesh. When nitrate fertilisers are used in their cultivation they become yellow and taste much more like a conventional pineapple.

In 2014, the population of the sub-prefecture of Jacqueville was 32,288.

<doc id="1005176" wikidata="Q714180" url="?curid=1005176" title="Ficus microcarpa">
<text>Ficus microcarpa, also known as Chinese banyan, small-fruited fig, Malayan banyan, Indian laurel, or curtain fig, is a species of banyan tree in the family Moraceae. Its native range is from India to China and Japan, through Southeast Asia and the western Pacific to the state of Queensland in Australia, and it has been introduced to parts of the Americas and the Mediterranean. It was first described in 1782, and is a culturally significant plant in a number of Asian countries.

==Description==
&quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; is a large tropical tree to tall, occasionally to , with innumerable aerial roots descending from the branches that have the capacity to develop into accessory trunks or &quot;prop roots&quot;. It may initially be epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestial. The leaves are narrowly to broadly elliptic, measuring up to long by wide. They are (without hairs) and have 5–9 pairs of main lateral veins either side of the midrib, which form distinct loops within the leaf margin.
==Taxonomy==

&quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; was described in 1782 by Carl Linnaeus the Younger. The species has a considerable number of synonyms. In 1965, E. J. H. Corner described seven varieties (and two forms of &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; var. &quot;microcarpa&quot;) which were regarded as synonyms under the name of &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; in the latest Flora Malesiana volume.

Hill&#x27;s weeping fig was first formally described as a species, Ficus hillii, by Frederick Manson Bailey in the &quot;Botany Bulletin&quot; of the Queensland Department of Agriculture, based on a specimen collected in the &quot;scrubs of tropical Queensland&quot;. In 1960, it was reassigned by E. J. H. Corner as a variety of &quot;F. microcarpa&quot;, namely F. microcarpa&quot; var. &quot;hillii.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; is native to tropical Asia, southern China, Taiwan, islands of the Western Pacific and Australia. A tropical and subtropical species, the tree requires a warm climate and a humid atmosphere. It can nevertheless withstand temperatures close to 0 °C. The species occurs mainly at low elevations, and its natural habitats include tropical rainforests, river edges, coasts, swamps and mangroves.

===Introduced range===
&quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; was widely distributed as an ornamental plant and is one of the most common street trees in warm climates. It has been introduced to a number of countries in the Mediterranean, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Hawaii, California and Florida in the US.

In urbanized areas, trees can grow in cracks, walls, buildings and other masonry elements. It seems that the species can tolerate urban pollutants in soil moisture, including sulfur dioxide, lead and cadmium, as well as salt.

The symbiotic pollinating fig wasp, &quot;Eupristina verticillata&quot;, was introduced along with &quot;F. microcarpa&quot;. Such an introduction, however, can be delayed: in Brazil - where specimens of the tree had been used in gardening since the nineteenth century, when it was introduced by the architect Auguste François Marie Glaziou into various public parks of Rio de Janeiro - the appearance of saplings began only during the 1970s. Such saplings are considered to be very aggressive, as they can grow in the walls of buildings, bridges, highways, and other concrete structures.

The tree is considered a major invasive species in Hawaii, Florida, Bermuda, Central America, and South America. &quot;F. microcarpa&quot; is widely used as a street and ornamental tree in areas of coastal California that are free of regular frost. Its strong roots can lift sidewalks and pavements, and many California cities no longer recommend planting them. In Southern California, a population of the symbiotic fig wasp is now established, which allows the ornamental trees to produce fertile fruit. Seeds are spread by fruit-eating birds, and &quot;F. microcarpa&quot; can now spread without direct human help. Naturalized populations have been found in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Diego, and Ventura counties, including on buildings, bridges, and other structures, and as an epiphyte on other trees, especially palm trees. It is commonly used as an ornamental tree in most of Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean coast, as in the Balearic and the Canary islands. Ficus microcarpa can also be found on the southern coast of Sicily, in Rhodes and Cyprus. It is considered an invasive plant in Israel, although it is not widespread.

==Ecology==
The pollinating fig wasp associated with &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; is &quot;Eupristina verticillata&quot;. In addition, 19 non-pollinating fig wasp species parasitize &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; figs.
These fig wasps are from different families, which include those of the Eurytomidae and Pteromalidae families.

In some parts of its introduced range, it is very attractive to avian wildlife: in São Paulo, Brazil, ten species of birds were listed as feeding on its fruits, especially &quot;Turdus rufiventris&quot;, &quot;Pitangus sulphuratus&quot;, &quot;Turdus leucomelas&quot;, &quot;Thraupis sayaca&quot; and &quot;Celeus flavescens&quot;. Its fruit and leaves are also sought after and eaten by the parrot &quot;Aratinga leucophthalmus&quot;. Although invasive, its hardiness makes it an important species for the attraction of avian wildlife in urban environments.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree for planting in gardens, parks, and in containers as an indoor plant and bonsai specimen. In Southeast Asia, it is cultivated as a shade tree because of its dense foliage. Its ability to produce discards also makes it easy to drive in hedge or bush.

As a tropical and subtropical tree, it is suitable for temperatures above 20 °C all year long, which explains why it is generally sold as a houseplant. It can, however, withstand relatively low temperatures, suffering damage only below 0 °C. High humidity (70% - 100%) is preferable and seems to favor the development of aerial roots. The species can be propagated easily by cuttings, either in water or directly in a substrate of sand or potting soil.

===Medicine===
The plant is also used in traditional medicine in India, Malaysia, China and Japan. In Japan, the bark, the aerial roots and dried leaves are traditionally used against pain and fever, while in China the plant is traditionally used among others against the flu, the malaria, bronchitis and rheumatism. The pharmacological properties of &quot;Ficus microcarpa&quot; would include antioxidant activities, antibacterial, anticarcinogen and anti diabetic agents.

==Folklore==
In Southeast Asia, &quot;F. microcarpa&quot;, among other species, is thought to be home to spirits, such as Pontianak (folklore). In China, large fig trees can be associated with beneficial spirits and vital energy (&quot;Qi&quot;). In Singapore, some trees are associated with places of worship among Buddhists and Taoists.

<text>Grand-Bassam () is a town in southeastern Ivory Coast, lying east of Abidjan. It is a sub-prefecture of and the seat of Grand-Bassam Department; it is also a commune. During the late 19th century, Grand-Bassam was briefly the French colonial capital of Ivory Coast. Because of its outstanding examples of colonial architecture and town-planning, and the juxtaposition of the colonial town with a traditional Nzema village, the historic center of Grand-Bassam was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012.

In 2021, the population of the sub-prefecture of Grand-Bassam was 124,567.

== Geography ==
The town is divided by the Ébrié Lagoon into two-halves: &quot;Ancien Bassam&quot; is the former French settlement, facing the Gulf of Guinea. It is home to the grander colonial buildings, some of which have been restored. The district is also home to a cathedral and the Ivory Coast National Museum of Costume, located in the former Governor&#x27;s Palace. &quot;Nouveau Bassam&quot;, linked to Ancient Bassam by a bridge, lies on the inland, northern side of the lagoon. It grew from the African servants&#x27; quarters and is now the main commercial centre of the town.

The town is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand-Bassam. The diocese&#x27;s cathedral is the Cathédrale Sacré Cœur in Grand-Bassam.

== History ==

The name &quot;Bassam&quot; may come from an ancient African word for the mouth of the Comoé River. Inhabited by the Nzema people since the 15th century, the city grew into a profitable fishing village and a trading center. In 1843, after signing a treaty with the African ruler of the Grand-Bassam region, the French built Fort Memours on the banks of the river. This fort became the primary French trading point in the region, and after the Berlin Conference in 1885, became a base for exploration of West Africa by the colonizers. Grand-Bassam became the capital for the French &quot;Colonie de Côte d’Ivoire&quot; from 1893 until 1900.

In 1899, the colonial administration was transferred to the nearby town, Bingerville, after a devastating outbreak of yellow fever, which decimated the town&#x27;s population. However, the town remained a key seaport until the growth of Abidjan in the 1930s. The town has the aura of a ghost town, since large sections have been abandoned for decades. In 1960, with independence, all remaining administrative offices were transferred to Abidjan, and for many years Grand-Bassam was inhabited only by squatters. Beginning in the late 1970s, the town began to revive as a tourist destination and craft centre.

In March 2016, the town was targeted in an Islamist mass shooting that perpretated by AQIM, which killed 19 people.

<doc id="1005198" wikidata="Q1152295" url="?curid=1005198" title="Snow Bros.">
<text>is a 1990 platform arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan first published in Japan, then in North America by Romstar and later in Europe. Starring the eponymous snowmen twins Nick and Tom, players are tasked with travelling through 50 stages, throwing and building snowballs, jumping on and off platforms to navigate level obstacles while dodging and defeating monsters in order to rescue the princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi from captivity. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later ported across multiple platforms, each one being created by different third-party developers and featuring several changes or additions compared with the original version. Conversions for various microcomputers were in development but none were officially released to the public.

&quot;Snow Bros.&quot; was met with mostly positive reception from critics and players alike, earning an award from &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine and gaining a cult following since its initial release. In 1994, a sequel titled &quot;Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves&quot; was released by Hanafram, serving as the last game by Toaplan prior to their closure. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge. A modernized version of the game titled &quot;Snow Bros Special&quot; was developed by CRT Games and published by Daewon Media Game Lab and Clear River Games for Nintendo Switch, and was released on May 19, 2022.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Snow Bros.&quot; is a platform game reminiscent of &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; and &quot;Tumblepop&quot;, where players assume the role of snowmen twins Nick (P1) and Tom (P2) through 50 increasingly difficult stages, each with a boss at every tenth stage that must be fought before progressing any further, in an effort to rescue twin princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi from captivity as the main objective. The plot summary of &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; varies between each region and version. In the NES port, King Scorch cursed princes Nick and Tom by turning them into snowmen, while he also captured the princess twins Teri and Tina, leading the brothers to defeat the king to save their land.

Each player can throw snow at enemies until each one is completely covered and turns into a snowball, however partially covered enemies in snow cannot move until they shake it off. Once an enemy has been turned into a snowball, players can roll or throw the snowball, which will rebound off of walls until eventually shattering against a wall. Any enemies the snowball rolls into are eliminated and other stationary snowballs start rolling when the rolling snowball touches them. If players manage to take out all enemies by kicking one snowball (this one snowball may be used to make others bounce around as well and increase the chances to pull this trick off), bonus money will fall from the sky. If the player takes too much time to complete a level, an evil pumpkin head will come and try to kill the players. It is invincible but can be stunned and sent to appear elsewhere in the level with snowballs or snow shots. The evil pumpkin head will eventually spawn ghosts that travel freely through the level and seek the player character. These ghosts cannot be killed or stunned and players must avoid them while killing the rest of the enemies.

When players bowl an enemy over, it may drop a potion item. The color of said potions lets players know what power-up it is: the red potion increases speed, blue increases the amount of snow thrown to cover enemies in snow easier, yellow increases the distance that snow can be thrown, while green causes the snowmen to inflate like a balloon while having the ability to fly around the screen and knock out enemies for a limited period of time. The game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which are crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. If a single player is downed, their character is immediately respawned at the location they start at on every stage. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the characters&#x27; firepower and speed to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.

== Development ==
=== Amiga version ===

&quot;Snow Bros.&quot; for the Amiga was created by Ocean France, the French division of publisher Ocean Software that previously worked on other conversions such as &quot;Pang&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2&quot;, with Marc Djan managing its development. Ocean Software acquired the license after the European Computer Entertainment Show in September 1990 while work on the port immediately began as soon as programmer Pierre Adane finished his task of converting &quot;Pang&quot;.

Despite receiving almost no support from Toaplan, the team at Ocean France wanted the Amiga port of &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; to be as close as possible to the arcade original, playing the coin-op machine from start to finish while using it as reference when taking notes about certain elements such as animations, graphic techniques and enemy AI. Work on the conversion was primarily done on Amiga and Atari ST-based systems, while custom software was written to animate sprites and build stages as a jigsaw puzzle using low memory, which allowed an easier coding process to implement every element from the arcade version like hidden bonus secrets. Artists Philippe and Lionel Dessoly, as well as Francis Fournier adapted the arcade artwork for the conversion, using a ST set-up for maps and sprites, while Pierre Loriaux was responsible for sound design.

The crew also included new additions such as cutscenes between stages and Adane was also able to replicate the original gameplay speed, though alterations had to be made to make the game more playable. Adane said that co-op play was removed in order to maintain a stable frame rate during gameplay, which was deemed by Djan as &quot;probably the most important factor&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Snow Bros.&quot; was first released for arcades in April 1990, in Japan by Toaplan and North America by Romstar, and later in Europe the same year. The game ran on a proprietary arcade board manufactured by Toaplan, which was notable for its small size. The soundtrack was composed by Osamu Ōta. The same year on 21 October, an album containing music from the title and &quot;Out Zone&quot; was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon, featuring an arranged soundtrack composed by Ōta.

=== Ports ===
The Game Boy conversion, titled &quot;Snow Bros. Jr.&quot;, was developed by Dual and first released in Japan by Naxat Soft on 24 May 1991 and later in North America by Capcom in January 1992. It is single-player only and changes the story to compensate for this by having one of the titular snowmen twins be kidnapped while the other sets out to rescue him. Several other aspects of the game were changed due to the technical restrictions of the Game Boy, such as bosses that originally fought in pairs in the arcade version now fight alone and potions are now given different shape due to the lack of color display on the original Game Boy. The Game Boy version also adds an extra set of 10 levels after the 50 levels adapted from the arcade version are cleared.

The Nintendo Entertainment System version, titled &quot;Snow Brothers&quot; in western regions, was developed by Soft House and first released in North America by Capcom in November 1991, then in Japan on December of the same year by Toaplan as well as in Europe. It features a new story sequence at the beginning which depicts an origin story unique to this version in which Nick and Tom are established to be human princes who were cursed into becoming snowmen by an evil demon named King Scorch.

The Sega Mega Drive version was released only in Japan by Tengen on 28 May 1993 and the only console version of the game to be developed by Toaplan. It features a new opening story sequence at the start of the game, as well as 20 additional levels set after the original 50 levels, in which the player switches controls from Nick and Tom to the twin princesses Puripuri and Puchipuchi after the snowmen twins themselves get kidnapped by a new adversary. The Mega Drive version is included on both the Japanese and Asian versions of the Sega Genesis Mini.

ISAC Entertainment released an enhanced version of &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; for iOS and Android mobile devices in 2012. &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; was included as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade 1&quot; compilation for Evercade.

=== Cancelled ports ===
Ocean France had plans to develop &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; for various microcomputer and console platforms such as the Amstrad GX4000, Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1991 but none of these conversions were officially released by Ocean Software. Like the Game Boy port, the Amiga version lacks multiplayer functionality due to gameplay reasons. A ROM image of the Amiga version was leaked online in 2006. A PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version was also planned but never released.

== Reception ==
&quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; to be the eleventh most popular arcade game at the time. &quot;Game Machine&quot; also listed the title on their 15 June 1990 issue as being the eleventh most popular arcade game in Japan at the time. Donn Nauert of &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; gave a positive outlook to the arcade version. In the September 1990 issue of Japanese publication &quot;Micom BASIC Magazine&quot;, the game was ranked on the number eight spot in popularity. Den of Geek noted it to be one of the titles from Toaplan in which the company pursued other game genres besides their shoot &#x27;em up endeavors. The arcade original has gained a cult following since its release.

The Game Boy port was met with positive reception from critics. Fan reception was positive: in a poll taken by &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot;, it received a score of 19.7 out of 30, indicating a popular following.

The NES conversion was also met with positive reception from reviewers. Fan reception was also positive: garnering a score of 19.7 out of 30, indicating a popular following.

The Amiga version of &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; was met with positive reception from critics prior to its cancellation.

== Legacy ==
A sequel, titled &quot;Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves&quot; (known in Japan as &quot;Otenki Paradise: Snow Bros. 2&quot;) was launched in 1994 and served as the final arcade project developed by Toaplan, as the company filed for bankruptcy during the game&#x27;s release. A game of a similar style titled &quot;Nightmare in the Dark&quot; was developed in 2000 by AM Factory and published by Eleven/Gavaking and SNK for the Neo Geo MVS.

In 2002, a Mexican company known as Syrmex Electronics created a hack of the original &quot;Snow Bros.&quot; running on similar hardware called &quot;Snow Brothers 3: Magical Adventure&quot;, replacing Nick and Tom with soccer players who shoot soccer balls instead of snowballs, while featuring levels similar to those of the original despite new graphics and artwork added to the levels&#x27; backgrounds. It was the only game developed by Syrmex.

In more recent years, the rights to &quot;Snow Bros.&quot;, its successor and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after &quot;Truxton&quot;″s Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022. A revival for Nintendo Switch was developed by CRT Games and released in 2022 by Daewon Media Game Lab (downloads) and Clear River Games (physical copies).

A follow-up to &quot;Snow Bros. 2&quot;, named &quot;Snow Bros. Wonderland&quot;, is scheduled for release on November 28, 2024 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The game is developed by Tatsujin and published by Clear River Games.

<doc id="1005202" wikidata="Q2986654" url="?curid=1005202" title="Guantanamo military commission">
<text>The Guantanamo military commissions were established by President George W. Bush through a military order on November 13, 2001, to try certain non-citizen terrorism suspects at the Guantanamo Bay prison. To date, there have been a total of eight convictions in the military commissions, six through plea agreements. Several of the eight convictions have been overturned in whole or in part on appeal by U.S. federal courts.

There are five cases currently ongoing in the commissions and another two pending appeal, including &quot;United States v. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, et al.&quot;—the prosecution of the detainees alleged to be most responsible for the September 11 attacks. None of those five cases has yet gone to trial.

== History ==

As explained by the Congressional Research Service, the United States first used military commissions to try enemy belligerents accused of war crimes during the occupation in Mexico in 1847, made use of them in the Civil War and in the Philippine Insurrection, and then again in the aftermath of World War II. In &quot;Ex parte Quirin&quot;, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), the United States Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of a military tribunal over eight German saboteurs captured in the United States during World War II. &quot;Quirin&quot; has been cited as a precedent for the trial by military commission of unlawful combatants. For the next fifty years, however, the U.S. relied on its established federal court and military justice systems to prosecute alleged war crimes and terrorism offenses.

On November 13, 2001, President Bush issued a military order governing the &quot;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism&quot;. The order effectively established the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, which began in 2004 with charges against four Guantanamo detainees.

In 2006, the US Supreme Court struck down the military commissions (in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;), determining that the commissions violated both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In response, and in order to permit the commissions to go forward, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). Congress significantly amended the MCA in 2009. In 2019, exercising authority granted to him under the MCA, the Secretary of Defense published an updated Manual for Military Commissions, which sets forth the current procedures that govern the commissions.

==Costs==
According to the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), from fiscal years 2012 to 2018 the Department of Defense spent $679.6 million on the military commissions. Defense Department officials told GAO that the department plans to spend almost $1 billion more from fiscal year 2019 through at least fiscal year 2023.

==Commission cases and status==
Of the 779 men detained at Guantanamo at some point since the prison opened on January 11, 2002, only 32 have been charged by military commissions. Charges were dismissed in 12 of those cases, and stayed in another. The U.S. government has procured eight convictions total, six of which were achieved through plea agreements. U.S. federal courts have overturned several of the eight convictions in whole or in part.

There are five cases currently ongoing in the commissions—and another two pending appeal—including &quot;United States v. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, et al.&quot;—the prosecution of the detainees alleged to be most responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks. None of those five cases has yet gone to trial.

On July 9, 2021, Brig. Gen. Mark Martins – the chief prosecutor for the military commissions since March 2009 – announced his retirement. That same day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;General Martins submitted his retirement papers ... after repeatedly butting heads with Biden administration lawyers over positions his office had taken on the applicable international law and the Convention Against Torture at the Guantánamo court, according to senior government officials with knowledge of the disputes.&quot;

=== Active cases and pending appeals ===
=== Closed, inactive, and dismissed cases ===

== Public access limitations ==
The Department of Defense currently facilitates public access to the military commissions, and to information about military commission proceedings, in the following ways:

* communicating directly with victims and their family members about hearings;
* enabling selected members of the public to view proceedings in-person;
* providing five sites in the United States to view proceedings remotely via closed circuit television (CCTV);
* making information such as court documents available on the Office of Military Commissions&#x27; website.

In practice, there are significant limitations associated with most of these access methods. Through the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress required the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the feasibility and advisability of expanding access to military commissions proceeding that are open to the public. GAO published its report in February, 2019. Its findings included:

=== In-person viewing ===
Travel to Guantanamo is onerous, and logistics once there are difficult. The military commissions courtroom gallery limits attendance to 52 seats. Moreover, GAO notes that &quot;while selected victims and family members and non-government stakeholders are able to view proceedings in-person [at Guantanamo] the vast majority of the general public cannot, due to DOD policy.&quot;

=== Remote viewing ===
GAO noted that &quot;victims and their family members are located throughout the world or are concentrated in areas of the United States that are a significant distance from one of these five locations.&quot; Moreover, some victims and family members reported that they or their relatives have been denied access to certain of the sites because, &quot;according to DOD, they did not meet the department&#x27;s definition of a victim or family member.&quot;

=== Timeliness of publishing documents ===
By regulation, the Defense Department is supposed to post court documents on the Office of Military Commissions website generally no later than 15 business days after they have been filed in court. However, GAO found that &quot;DOD has generally not met this standard for the timely posting of documents, which substantially limits public access to information about proceedings.&quot; A sampling of over 11,000 filings from a six-month period in 2018 showed that, save for unofficial court transcripts from open hearing, filings were not posted until &quot;almost four months to more than five months past DOD&#x27;s timeliness standard.&quot;

=== Secrecy ===
Defense Department officials told GAO that &quot;unlike most—if not all—federal criminal trials or courts-martial, commissions&#x27; court documents and proceedings regularly involve an unprecedented amount of classified information that cannot be shared with the public. For example, DOD officials told us that a substantial amount of evidence used in the commissions&#x27; proceedings relates to partially-classified activities conducted by intelligence agencies outside the department—such as the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s former Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation Program.&quot;

Consistent with GAO&#x27;s findings, on August 4, 2021, 75 Members of Congress wrote to President Biden urging greater transparency in the military commissions process.

== Comparisons to U.S. and international systems ==

===United States justice systems===
The United States has two parallel justice systems, with laws, statutes, precedents, rules of evidence, and paths for appeal. Under these justice systems, prisoners have certain rights. They have a right to know the evidence against them; they have a right to protect themselves against self-incrimination; they have a right to counsel; and they have a right to have the witnesses against them cross-examined.

The two parallel justice systems are the Judicial Branch of the U.S. Government, and a slightly streamlined justice system named the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for people under military jurisdiction. People undergoing a military court martial are entitled to the same basic rights as those in the civilian justice system.

The Guantanamo military trials under the 2006 MCA do not operate according to either system of justice. The differences include:

* Unlike civilian courts, only two-thirds of the jury needs to agree in order to convict someone under the military commission rules. This includes charges such as supporting terrorism, attempted murder, and murder. 
* The accused are not allowed access to all the evidence against them. The Presiding Officers are authorized to consider secret evidence which the accused have no opportunity to see or refute. 
* It may be possible for the commission to consider evidence that was extracted through coercive interrogation techniques before passage of the Detainee Treatment Act. Legally, the commission is restricted from considering any evidence extracted by torture, as defined by the Department of Defense in 2006.
* The proceedings may be closed at the discretion of the Presiding Officer, so that secret information may be discussed by the commission. 
* The accused are not permitted a free choice of attorneys, as they can use only military lawyers or those civilian attorneys eligible for the Secret security clearance.
* Because the accused are charged as unlawful combatants (a certain category of people who are not classified as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions), then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said in March 2002 that an acquittal on all charges by the commission is no guarantee of a release.

===International===
International human rights law prohibits trying non-military personnel in military tribunals. The United States has also never ratified the International Criminal Court statute, and withdrew its original signature of accession when it feared repercussions of the Iraq War.

Much like the military commissions, the International Criminal Court (ICC) trial procedures call for:

* A majority of the three judges present, as triers of fact, may reach a decision, which must include a full and reasoned statement. However, and unlike the U.S. Military Commission, those are &quot;judges &quot;and not mere military officers. Additionally, the ICC statute requires the judges to be of a high level of competence in criminal law and the necessary relevant experience; or have established competence in relevant areas of international law such as international humanitarian law and the law of human rights and extensive experience in a professional legal capacity which is of relevance to the judicial work of the Court.
* Trials are supposed to be public, but proceedings are often closed, and such exceptions to a public trial have not been enumerated in detail. Nonetheless, the ICC statute explicitly states that the principle is a public trial, and exceptions could be entertained by the judges if they provide sufficient grounding.
* &quot;In camera&quot; proceedings are allowed for protection of witnesses or defendants as well as for confidential or sensitive evidence. However, the statute states that this is an &quot;exception &quot;to the principle of public hearings which the court applies in particular to victims of sexual violence and children who are victims or witnesses.
* Hearsay and other indirect evidence is not explicitly prohibited in the statute, which adds flexibility to the proceedings due to the different legal traditions of the judges or of the applied law. But it has been argued the court is guided by hearsay exceptions which are prominent in common law systems, similar to the military commissions. Nonetheless, established rules of international law provides that admissibility of such evidence by guided by &quot;&quot;hearsay exceptions generally recognized by some national legal systems, as well as the truthfulness, voluntariness and trustworthiness of the evidence.&quot; &quot;

== Criticisms ==
Many observers and stakeholders have expressed the view that the military commissions have failed. These observers and stakeholders include former senior U.S. government officials and military officers; families of victims of the 9/11 attacks; former military commission prosecutors; federal prosecutors; prosecutors from the Nuremberg trials following World War II; academics; Members of Congress; human rights organizations; and others. There has been outrage directed at the United States&#x27; usage of military commissions to try Guantanamo Bay detainees by the international community. Criticisms include that the militaries control of the trials has led to unfair results and procedures. The military tribunals secrecy, lack of habeas corpus, and overarching military control has led to criticisms against the US&#x27;s usage of them.

In an amicus brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court on August 20, 2021, September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows – an organization of more than 250 family members of those killed in the attacks of September 11, 2001 – wrote the following:

&quot;Through their collective experience, the pursuit of justice has appeared increasingly quixotic to the members of Peaceful Tomorrows, and they have lost confidence in the fairness and integrity of the Proceedings. As the twentieth anniversary of the September 11th attacks approaches, the members of Peaceful Tomorrows fear that the 9/11 Proceedings will never offer the justice they seek – namely, a fair trial that applies the rule of law to both sides and brings the defendants to justice. They also fear that the subjugation of the defendants&#x27; rights will result in a broader erosion of rights and undermine the historical legitimacy of the 9/11 Proceedings themselves.&quot;

<text>Sir Richard William Southern (8 February 1912 – 6 February 2001), who published under the name R. W. Southern, was a noted English medieval historian based at the University of Oxford.

==Biography==
Southern was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 8 February 1912, and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in history. At Oxford, Southern&#x27;s mentors were Sir Maurice Powicke and Vivian Hunter Galbraith. He was a fellow of Balliol from 1937 to 1961 (where he lectured alongside Christopher Hill), Chichele Professor of Modern History at Oxford from 1961 to 1969, and president of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1969 to 1981. He was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1969 to 1973. 

Southern was awarded the Balzan Prize for Medieval History in 1987. He was knighted in 1974. He died in Oxford on 6 February 2001. His son, Dr Peter Campbell David Southern, was Head Master of Bancroft&#x27;s School and Christ&#x27;s Hospital.

Southern is one of 20 medieval scholars profiled in Norman Cantor&#x27;s &quot;Inventing the Middle Ages: The Lives, Works and Ideas of the Great Medievalists of the Twentieth Century&quot;. Cantor considers Southern&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot; one of two best single-volume books on the Middle Ages written in the 20th century for inspiring a revolution in the study of the period. However, Southern declined to lead the revolution by forming a programmatic research institute. Cantor describes him in Arthurian terms, with a group of devotees (including Cantor) who surrounded their master following the publication of &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot;. Like Arthurian legend, Southern&#x27;s story does not have an entirely happy ending, and Cantor describes his sense of disappointment when Southern failed to live up to Cantor&#x27;s expectations.

In addition to the influence exerted by his works, Southern had several prominent students who carried his influence into the next generation. Robert Bartlett and R. I. Moore, for example, share Southern&#x27;s interest in the development of Europe in the High Middle Ages, and Valerie Flint had some of Southern&#x27;s tendencies towards iconoclasm. 

==Publications==
Southern&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot; (1953) was a seminal work, and established Southern&#x27;s reputation as a medievalist. This pioneering work, sketching the main personalities and cultural influences that shaped the character of Western Europe from the late tenth to the early thirteenth century and describing the development of social, political, and religious institutions, opened up new vistas in medieval history, and has been translated into many languages. The final chapter of the book (a chapter dedicated to spirituality) has often been credited with helping to popularize the thesis that in the 11th century Anselm of Canterbury &quot;was the founder of the new type of ardent and effusive self-disclosure&quot;, epitomizing a broader tendency to &quot;a greater measure of solitude, of introspection, and self-knowledge&quot; that &quot;ran like fire through Europe in the generation after his death and produced an outburst of meditations and spiritual soliloquies&quot;. Southern&#x27;s ideas were seminal for generations of scholars of medieval spirituality, helping them to build a picture of what they called affective piety – emotionally charged prayer and meditation mostly focused on the Passion of Christ.

Southern made major contributions to the areas he studied, and was not afraid to attack long-held views. Southern&#x27;s monographic studies of St Anselm and Robert Grosseteste, for example, have had significant influences on their historiography. Never afraid of controversy, Southern&#x27;s interpretation of Grosseteste made a dramatic attempt to revise the chronology of Grosseteste&#x27;s life. Further, Southern saw him as a particularly English figure (in contrast to earlier scholarship, which had seen Grosseteste&#x27;s connections to French schools as being of particular importance). Southern also took a revisionist line in his re-interpretation of the School of Chartres, an argument stated first in his &quot;Medieval Humanism&quot; and then refined in his &quot;Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe.&quot; Southern argued that scholars in the 19th and early 20th centuries had built the &quot;School of Chartres&quot; into a romanticised edifice out of all proportion with the documentary record. The figures in the School of Chartres were actually much more active in Paris than in Chartres itself, according to Southern; Chartres did indeed have a school, but it did not surpass the usual level of cathedral schools of the time. Southern&#x27;s revisionist or iconoclastic approach was continued by some of his students. Valerie Flint, for example, attempted to make significant revisions to the interpretation of Anselm of Laon.

Southern&#x27;s final major work, &quot;Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe,&quot; was unfortunately destined to remain unfinished at his death. Southern never managed to finish the third volume of the work. The first two volumes do, however, represent a major contribution to medieval scholarship. In the work, Southern argues that, from the 12th century on, medieval scholars aspired to systematise all human knowledge in a comprehensive system. Furthermore, this scholarly vision (the &quot;scholastic humanism&quot; of the title) was to have a major influence on Western culture beyond the schools, as scholars and school-educated men moved out of the schools and took important roles in the government and the church.

In addition to these major works, Southern also wrote several works that have not had quite as much influence on medieval scholarship. His brief &quot;Western Views of Islam in the Middle Ages&quot; represents a relatively early effort to describe medieval attitudes towards Islam, identifying three stages in their development. His &quot;Medieval Humanism and Other Studies&quot; states first several themes that would be later developed in &quot;Scholastic Humanism.&quot; His &quot;Western Society and the Church in the Middle Ages&quot; is a textbook survey like &quot;The Making of the Middle Ages&quot; but has not received quite as much attention as his earlier work.

<text>Nikolai Dmitrievich Brashman (; ; June 14, 1796 – ) was a Russian mathematician of Jewish-Austrian origin. He was a student of Joseph Johann Littrow, and the advisor of Pafnuty Chebyshev and August Davidov.

He was born in Neu-Raußnitz (today Rousínov in Czech Republic, then in Austrian Empire) and studied at the University of Vienna and Vienna Polytechnic Institute. In 1824 he moved to Saint Petersburg and then accepted a position at the Kazan University. In 1834 he became a professor of applied mathematics at the Moscow University. There he is best remembered as a founder of the Moscow Mathematical Society and its journal &quot;Matematicheskii Sbornik&quot;.

For his mechanics textbook, in 1836 Brashman was awarded the Demidov Prize by the Russian Academy of Sciences. The academy elected him a corresponding member in 1855. He died in Moscow in 1866.

<text>Speke () is a suburb of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is southeast of the city centre. Located near the widest part of the River Mersey, it is bordered by the suburbs of Garston and Hunts Cross, and nearby to Halewood, Hale Village, and Widnes. The rural area of Oglet borders its south.

==History==
The name derives from the Old English &quot;Spec&quot;, meaning &#x27;brushwood&#x27; or from Middle English &quot;Spek(e)&quot;, meaning &#x27;woodpecker&#x27;.
It was known as &quot;Spec&quot; in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, which gave Speke Hall as one of the properties held by Uctred. Today Speke Hall, now a Tudor wood-framed house, is open to the public.

In the mid 14th century, the manors of Speke, Whiston, Skelmersdale, and Parr were held by William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre.

Speke was formerly a township in the parish of Childwall, in 1866 Speke became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1931 the parish had a population of 384.

Until the 1930s development by Sir Lancelot Keay, Speke was a small village with a population of 400; by the end of the 1950s more than 25,000 people were living in the area. The local All Saints Church was built by the last resident owner of Speke Hall, Miss Adelaide Watt.

From 1795 until 1921, the Speke estate had belonged to the Watt family; when the family died out, the estate was placed in trust. It was bought by the Liverpool Corporation in 1928 for £200,000; the corporation&#x27;s intention was to build a complete self-contained satellite town (at a time when the garden city movement was underway). The parish of Speke became part of the county borough of Liverpool in 1932, having previously belonged to the Whiston Rural District.

Constructed between 1930 and 1933, by the start of World War II, Speke Airport was the second busiest in the UK. Retention of control by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in London after the war meant that it had lost its leading position in the UK by the 1950s. The industrial rise of Speke continued until the mid-1970s, when an equally rapid decline ensued over the next 20 years, particularly during the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. The closure of the Bryant and May match factory in December 1994 was a noted example of these problems, as was the closure of the Triumph car plant more than a decade before. The area has however retained a cluster of pharmaceutical facilities, with companies operating there including Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco), MedImmune, and Novartis.

When the 2000 Index of Multiple Deprivation was published, Speke was revealed to be the second most deprived of all 8,414 wards in England and Wales. Only Benchill in Manchester had a higher level of deprivation.

==Community==

Speke is known for Speke Hall, a Tudor wood-framed house now owned by the National Trust and open to the public. It is also notable as the location of Liverpool John Lennon Airport, known until 2001 as Liverpool Speke Airport. From the mid-1990s the re-development of the original airport site, enabled by the construction of the new airport complex and runway, had left land available for the construction of a business park. The completion of the A5001 road consolidated the rise of the airport and improved communications in the area. The Speke Liverpool local history website shows a lot of the developments that changed Speke the village into Speke the estate with photographs and documents from the 1870s onwards.

The New Mersey Shopping Park was re-developed in 1999 from an older retail site. It houses many large retail and textile outlets as well as mainstream restaurants. The New Mersey Retail Estate is situated between Speke and Garston, directly opposite to the Old Liverpool Airport main terminal building, which is now a hotel complex.

The area also features the Mersey Wave, officially opened on 15 December 2003, a and high illuminated sculpture comprising two sets of six aluminium fins. The sculpture, designed by Peter Fink, was removed for repairs within weeks of opening, a problem causing its fins to move dangerously in high winds having been discovered. It was rebuilt in June 2005 and the structure, taller than the Angel of the North at Gateshead, is visible from as far as Winter Hill, Horwich, Greater Manchester.

In 2011, planning was submitted and subsequently granted for Estuary Banks, a £6 million business park scheme developed by Capital &amp; Centric Plc and Barnfield Construction. Constructed started on of speculative construction in November 2011. The latest phase (120,000 sq ft) has been completed with 80,000 sold to Business First in June 2012.

Recent developments in Speke have seen a multimillion-pound Morrisons superstore, situated directly next to the A561 Speke Boulevard, which is located only metres away from the Mersey Wave. Planning was granted in May 2012 for Speke Business Park on Goodlass Road. It comprises of business units and was developed by Manchester-based developer Capital &amp; Centric Plc.

==Sport==
Speke South Liverpool, a local amateur football side, was founded at the Austin Rawlinson Sports Centre, Speke. However, late 2005 saw the club relocate a short distance away to Mossley Hill. The leading amateur football club in the area now is St Christophers FC, who are located at Central Way Playing Fields.

==Transport==
The main road network in Speke is the &quot;A561 Speke Boulevard&quot; which links the area to Garston, Aigburth, Dingle/Toxteth in the West and Widnes and Runcorn in the East. Close by is the A5300 &quot;Knowsley Expressway&quot; which provides links to the A562 to Widnes and Runcorn, the M62 motorway and eventually becomes the M57 at Tarbock Interchange.

The Speke estate was generally built around two notable roads &quot;Western Avenue&quot; and &quot;Eastern Avenue&quot; which linked to a former shopping parade in Central Way in more recent years this was replaced by an extensive shopping and retail development off Eastern Avenue and Speke Boulevard.

Speke is also approximately 8 to 9 miles away from the western terminus of the M62, &quot;Rocket Roundabout&quot; in Broadgreen.

Speke has a fairly extensive bus network which use the &quot;Aigburth Road/Park Road&quot; and &quot;Allerton Road/Penny Lane&quot; corridors in South Liverpool and are mostly provided by Arriva North West. Services 80/80A, 82/82A, 86A and 500 link Speke to Liverpool City Centre and these services provide links to Dingle, Toxteth, Aigburth, Mossley Hill, Allerton, Grassendale and Garston with the 82A continuing further afield to Widnes and Runcorn. The most notable of these services are the long established 80/80A and 82/82A which have linked Speke to the city centre for many, many years. Other notable bus services in the Speke area the 81/81A (Speke/Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Bootle) which links the South, East and North of Liverpool via the A5058 &quot;Queens Drive&quot;. and 89 (Liverpool John Lennon Airport to St Helens) which have both operated for many decades. There is also the 3A service which links Speke/Halewood to Huyton the 201 which on an infrequent service links Speke to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital along with various &quot;industrial&quot; and &quot;school&quot; bus services which pass through the area too.

Hunts Cross station on the Merseyrail network is the nearest National Rail station to Speke, roughly a mile apart from each other. Hunts Cross is also served by Northern and East Midlands Railway services which run to Warrington, Manchester and various towns and cities further afield. Liverpool South Parkway in nearby Garston could also be considered a rail and bus link to Speke and this also includes services from London Northwestern Railway which generally go to the West Midlands with connections to London Euston via the West Coast Main Line and Transport for Wales who operate a two hourly service to Chester along with a single early evening service extended to Wrexham General. Liverpool South Parkway is also served by bus services 80/80A, 86A, 166, 188, 201 and 786 by Arriva, and also services 82 and 86 by Stagecoach. Some of these bus services also provide links to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.

Liverpool John Lennon Airport is also located at the base of the Speke estate near the River Mersey and has undergone growth and expansion in recent years. The airport&#x27;s strategy is to cater largely for &#x27;low cost&#x27; operators and easyJet and Ryanair run the majority of routes at the airport. Services are also provided by Loganair, Lufthansa and PLAY and the airport serves various destinations in mainland Europe with some to North Africa and the Mediterranean/Middle East.

<text>indent is a Unix utility that reformats C and C++ code in a user-defined indentation style and coding style. Support for C++ code is minimal.

The original version of indent was written by David Willcox at the University of Illinois in November 1976. It was incorporated into 4.1BSD in October 1982. GNU indent was first written by Jim Kingdon in 1989. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Examples of usage==
The following command
$ indent -st -bap -bli0 -i4 -l79 -ncs -npcs -npsl -fca -lc79 -fc1 -ts4 some_file.c

indents codice_1 in a style resembling BSD/Allman style and writes the result to the standard output.

==GNU indent==
GNU indent is the GNU Project&#x27;s version of indent. A different indentation style, the GNU style, is used by default.

<text>Full Fathom Five, also referred to as FF5, were an Australian rock and electronica band formed in Brisbane, Queensland. They were described as &quot;Chemical Brothers on valium.&quot; They released a four-track extended play, &quot;Friend of Faux&quot;, on 1 May 2000. It was followed in December by their single, &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy&quot;, which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio, Triple J.

They started recording their debut album, &quot;07 Seven&quot;, in 2000 and released it in August 2001 via Valve Records, distributed by Warner. Derrin Cason of &quot;BrisPop&quot; observed, &quot;a well-constructed stylish piece of work, flowing from one style to another effortlessly... the sounds they make can get your head screwed with or your feet bounding off the dance floor. In other words, hear them live or in surround sound, it is definitely an uplifting experience.&quot;

In addition to their own albums, Full Fathom Five have recorded and performed with post-classical quintet Topology producing the critically acclaimed album &quot;Future Tense&quot;, and have been commissioned to remix many Australian artists such as Paul Kelly, David Bridie, Sunk Loto, Screamfeeder, and Tulipan. Collaborations with local visual artists have produced award-winning film clips, powerful stage performances and highly collectable street press and poster art. During Full Fathom Five&#x27;s earlier years a lot of their supplied press photography was in the form of substituted photos featuring collections of five or more people, usually old Russian or eastern European photographs and much of their poster art was inspired by early propaganda or futurist imagery.

Its members have included Tam Patton on decks, turntables, guitar and synthesisers, Josh Thomson on keyboards, Robert Mynard on bass guitar, Ian Thompson on guitar, samples and synthesisers, Sam Korman on samples, synthesisers and vocals, Ben Thomson on bass guitar, vocals, guitars and keyboards, James Capt on drums and percussion and Christian Ronquillo. Full Fathom Five is signed to Brisbane label Valve Records. The band&#x27;s name is from a line in &quot;The Tempest&quot; by Shakespeare.

<doc id="1005218" wikidata="Q3492931" url="?curid=1005218" title="Speed Art Museum">
<text>The Speed Art Museum, originally known as the J.B. Speed Memorial Museum, now colloquially referred to as the Speed by locals, is the oldest and largest art museum in Kentucky. It was established in 1927 in Louisville, Kentucky, on Third Street next to the University of Louisville Belknap campus. It receives around 180,000 visits annually.

The museum offers visitors a variety of &quot;art experiences&quot; outside its collection and international exhibitions, including the Community Days, Family Days, the Art Sparks Interactive Family Gallery, and the popular late-night event, &quot;After Hours at the Speed&quot;. The Speed is home to a premier art house cinema. 

The Speed houses ancient, classical, modern, and contemporary art from around the world. The focus of the collection is Western art, from antiquity to the present day. In particular, the museum holds significant collections of paintings from the Netherlands, France, and Italy, as well as important contemporary art and American decorative art. The Speed also holds meaningful works on paper, historical and contemporary Native American artworks, African artworks, and more.

==History==
The museum was built in 1927 by Arthur Loomis in the Neo-Classical style. Loomis was already well known in Louisville for landmarks like the Louisville Medical College and Levy Brothers. The original building was designed as an understated Beaux-Arts limestone facade. Hattie Bishop Speed established the museum in memory of her husband James Breckenridge Speed, a prominent Louisville businessman, art collector, and philanthropist. Speed set up the endowment to fund the museum, encouraging the museum to never charge admission.

The museum underwent a $60 million expansion and renovation project from September 2012 to March 2016, designed by architect Kulapat Yantrasast of wHY architecture. During the closure, the museum opened Local Speed, a satellite space in Louisville&#x27;s East Market District (NuLu) for rotating exhibitions, programs, and events.

The 62,500-square-foot North Building doubled the overall square footage and nearly tripled the gallery space from the previous wing. The expansion created a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, a 150-seat cinema, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multi-functional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertainment. Additionally, the new Elizabeth P. and Frederick K. Cressman Art Park and Public Piazza was created for the display of sculptures.

2012 – The museum begins another major transition with a $60 million expansion project that will create a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, 150-seat cinema, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multi-functional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertaining. The museum is closed to the public for three years during the construction period.

<doc id="1005220" wikidata="Q4951615" url="?curid=1005220" title="Box score">
<text>A box score is a structured summary of the results from a sport competition. The box score lists the game score as well as individual and team achievements in the game.

Among the sports in which box scores are common are baseball, basketball, American football, volleyball and hockey.

==Background==
The box score data is derived from a statistics sheet and is then summarized into a table of counts or averages. This is used to help determine the relationship between elements, and in sports, certain percentages often help define the success of a team. This information is then correlated to a player, or a team where it is read to obtain a general idea of how the game was played or how the player performed during the game, a season, or their career.

== Early implementation ==
Prominent baseball journalist Henry Chadwick is credited with creating the modern baseball box score in 1859. In addition to the creation of the Chadwick box score, Chadwick also coined the baseball term &quot;strike-out.&quot; The first game with the box score implemented was in 1859, featuring the Brooklyn Excelsiors versus the Brooklyn Stars, with the Brooklyn Stars being the victor.

==Terminology==
===Baseball===
In baseball, the box score indicates the runs scored in each inning, as well as the runs and hits scored by each team and errors charged to each team during the game. A baseball box score includes so much more than just runs, hits, and errors charged to teams.

<text>Allestree is a suburb and ward of the city of Derby, a unitary authority area, in Derbyshire, England. It is the northernmost ward and is on the A6 road, about north of Derby city centre. It is bordered by the district of Amber Valley along its western and northern edges and Erewash in its north-east corner. To the south it borders the ward of Mackworth and to the east the ward of Darley Abbey.

Allestree village was previously part of the Earl of Northumbria&#x27;s estate before the Norman Conquest, and was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as part of the Markeaton estate. The Allestree estate was acquired by the Mundy family in 1516 and stayed in the family until it was bought by Derby City Council in the early 20th century. The ward now contains the remaining parts of the village of Markeaton and became a parish in its own right in 1864 and was incorporated into the Borough of Derby in 1968. In 1961 the civil parish had a population of 7298. On 1 April 1968 the parish was abolished and merged with Derby, Little Eaton and Quarndon. It is now in the unparished area of Derby.

The ward is largely residential and has two parks, Allestree Park to the north and Markeaton Park to the south. Markeaton Park is the most used leisure facility in Derby with over 1 million visitors a year. The shopping needs of the area are met by the Park Farm shopping centre, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013 and at its inception was one of the largest of its kind in Europe.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Before the Norman Conquest, Allestree was a hamlet consisting of a few scattered dwellings that was part of the holding of the Earl of Northumbria. Later it was recorded in the Domesday book of 1086 as &quot;Adelardestreu&quot;, an outlier of the Manor of Markeaton held by Hugh, Earl of Chester. It was given by William the Conqueror to Henry de Ferrers as a reward for his work during the Conquest and later it passed to the Touchet family of Markeaton.

During the 12th century, most of the land changed hands and was sold to the Abbey of St Mary, in Darley, and then rented back to the Touchet family.
It was purchased by Sir John Mundy along with the estates of Markeaton and Mackworth from Lord Audley in 1516 and stayed in the family&#x27;s possession until it was sold to the Evans family in 1781. Between 1660 and 1690, Derby was represented in Parliament by Roger Allestry and his son William Allestry. They took their name from the village, rather than vice versa.

===Allestree village===
Allestree was formally a distinct rural settlement centred around St Edmund&#x27;s Church. The old village centre was designated a Conservation Area by the City Council in September 1991. The designated area starts on Cornhill encompassing part of the golf course on Allestree Park. All houses on St Edmund Close, Siddals Lane, The Poplars and the area to the north of Church Walk are included, as well as St Edmund&#x27;s Church and the adjacent Red Cow inn. The area surrounding the old village centre contains seven listed buildings, the church being the oldest. It dates from the 12th century, but all that remains of the original building is the ornately carved Romanesque doorway.

The village became a parish in its own right in 1864 and was incorporated into the Borough of Derby in 1968. Parts of the civil parish of Markeaton were incorporated into Allestree in 1934. Markeaton was originally a large estate that spread out through the northwest of Derby. It contained three outlying settlements that would later become Manors in their own right: Allestree, Knivedon, and Mackworth. It was owned at the time, as was Allestree, by Earl Hugh of Chester and controlled by a member of the Touchet family. The area now within Allestree contains what is left of the old village centre, which is Markeaton Manor, its grounds and Markeaton park.
Substantial development in the 1960s and 1970s led to the incorporation of Allestree into the borough of Derby in 1968.

==Geography==
Allestree is the northernmost ward of the district of Derby and as such its northern and western borders are mainly countryside as the ward gives way to the district of Amber Valley. The border with Darley to the east follows the A38 from Ashbourne Road roundabout until it crosses the River Derwent. The border then follows the river, then crosses the A6 and follows the border of Allestree Park. To the south the border runs along Ashbourne Road from the A38 to Markeaton Lane until it meets Markeaton Brook, which it follows. It then runs along Kedleston Road which it leaves and goes behind Woodlands Community School and Laburnum Crescent and finishes at Allestree Park.

The geology of the area consists of thick sandstones and marls formed in desert conditions in the Triassic period, some 250 million years ago, and thin-bedded sandstones and shales formed 300 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. Most of Britain at this time was a huge delta carrying vast amounts of sediment. These belong to the Millstone Grit formation which makes up much of the Peak District.

Allestree&#x27;s highest point is in the northern part of Allestree Park next to the water tower. This is also the highest part of the city of Derby.

==Landmarks==
===Allestree Park and Hall===
The area known as Allestree Park was enclosed in about 1818 and lies in the northern part of Allestree just inside the city boundaries. It has over of parkland, a permanent orienteering course and an angling lake. The park area, has been designated a nature reserve because of the diversity of habitats and species present. The main habitats present within the reserve include a large area of woodland to the north, a number of fields with a mixture of quality of grassland and a stream that flows through the site and a number of associated marshes. The park is currently () the site of the largest urban rewilding project in the UK.

Allestree Hall is a 19th-century former country house in Allestree Park. It is a Grade II* listed building made of millstone grit from Derwent Bank. The house was begun by Bache Thornhill and completed by John Giradot (High Sheriff of Derbyshire) with three storeys and five bays, the central three bowed with an ionic columned porch. Since the 1980s the hall has been unoccupied, and was included in the English Heritage at Risk Register 2010, which states that the internal condition of the building is poor but fair overall. The city and English Heritage are looking to find a suitable scheme to enable its redevelopment. , it remained on the Heritage at Risk register.

===Markeaton Park===

Markeaton Park lies in the south of the suburb, bordering Mackworth Estate below and Darley Abbey to the east. The park has a long history, being used to raise deer and boar as far back as the 1500s.

A hall was built on the estate in the 16th century though the exact dates are unknown; this was demolished in 1755 and a new hall erected in the same location designed by James Denstone of Derby. In 1964 Markeaton Hall was demolished because of neglect and structural damage caused during the army&#x27;s stay there. The only remnants of the original hall are the late 18th-century Grade II listed orangery that is used as a café, a number of walled gardens and ornamental gardens such as the formal terrace, the Rose Garden and herbaceous borders.

In September 1975 the park and its surroundings were designated a Conservation Area and Markeaton Park today is a public park covering approximately and the most-used leisure facility in Derby, with over 1 million visitors per year. A variety of activities are spread throughout the park, including a boating lake, pitch and putt course, children&#x27;s playground, mini golf course and a light railway. The park attracts people from around Derby but also from smaller surrounding towns such as Belper, Ilkeston and Ashbourne and even from as far as Nottingham and Sheffield. Markeaton Park can, therefore, be considered to be of regional significance.

===Old village centre===
The historical village centre is centred on the junction of St Edmund&#x27;s Close, Cornhill and Park Lane. This area has the majority of listed buildings within the ward, with the 12th-century St Edmund&#x27;s Church, Red Cow inn and Old School house along St Edmund&#x27;s Close and three properties along Cornhill. Yew Tree Cottage is further along Cornhill away from the village centre, but is the only timber-framed and thatched cottage left in the area.

The ward experienced large expansion in the 1930s when the area surrounding the historic village centre was developed; this is reflected in the increase in population between the 1931 and 1951 Census. A second wave of development occurred during the 1960s and 1970s around the Park Farm and Blenheim Drive areas, which resulted in the ward being incorporated into the Borough of Derby.

<text>Norman Frank Cantor (November 19, 1929 – September 18, 2004) was a Canadian-American medievalist. Known for his accessible writing and engaging narrative style, Cantor&#x27;s books were among the most widely read treatments of medieval history in English. He estimated that his textbook &quot;The Civilization of the Middle Ages&quot;, first published in 1963, had a million copies in circulation.

==Life==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to a Jewish family, Cantor received a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Manitoba in 1951. He moved to the United States to obtain an M.A. degree (1953) from Princeton University, then spent a year as a Rhodes Scholar at Oriel College, Oxford. He returned to Princeton and received his Ph.D. in 1957 under the direction of eminent medievalist Joseph R. Strayer. He also began his teaching career at Princeton.

After teaching at Princeton, Cantor became a professor at Columbia University from 1960 to 1966. He was a Leff professor at Brandeis University until 1970 and then was at Binghamton University until 1976, when he took a position at University of Illinois at Chicago for two years. He then went on to New York University (NYU), where he served as Dean of NYU&#x27;s College of Arts &amp; Sciences, as well as a professor of history, sociology and comparative literature. After a brief stint as Fulbright Professor at the Tel Aviv University History Department (1987–88), he returned to NYU where he taught as a professor emeritus until his retirement in 1999, at which time he devoted himself to working as a full-time writer.

Although his early work focused on English religious and intellectual history, Cantor&#x27;s later scholarly interests were diverse, and he found more success writing for a popular audience than he did engaging in more narrowly focused original research. He did publish one monograph study, based on his graduate thesis, &quot;Church, kingship, and lay investiture in England, 1089-1135&quot;, which appeared in 1958 and remains an important contribution to the topic of church-state relations in medieval England. Throughout his career, however, Cantor preferred to write on the broad contours of Western history, and on the history of academic medieval studies in Europe and North America, in particular the lives and careers of eminent medievalists. His books generally received mixed reviews in academic journals, but were often popular bestsellers, buoyed by Cantor&#x27;s fluid, often colloquial, writing style and his lively critiques of persons and ideas both past and present.

Cantor was intellectually conservative and expressed deep skepticism about what he saw as methodological fads, particularly Marxism and postmodernism, but he also argued for greater inclusion of women and minorities in traditional historical narratives. In his books &quot;Inventing the Middle Ages&quot; (1991) and &quot;Inventing Norman Cantor&quot; (2002), he reflected on his strained relationship over the years with other historians and with academia in general.

Upon retirement in 1999, Cantor moved to Miami, Florida, where he continued to work on several books up to the time of his death, including the New York Times bestseller &quot;In the Wake of the Plague&quot; (2001). He was also editor of &quot;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages&quot; (1999).

He died of a heart failure in Miami at the age of 74.

<doc id="1005247" wikidata="Q1154805" url="?curid=1005247" title="DOS Shell">
<text>DOS Shell is a file manager that debuted in MS-DOS and PC DOS version 4.0, released in June 1988. It was no longer included in MS-DOS version 6, but remained part of the Supplemental Disk. The Supplemental Disk could be ordered or could be downloaded through Microsoft&#x27;s FTP server. DOS Shell was retained in PC DOS until PC DOS 2000.

==Overview==
DOS Shell was one of the first successful attempts to create a basic graphical user interface (GUI) type file manager in DOS, although it is properly referred to as a text user interface (TUI) or Character-Oriented Windows (COW) even though graphical modes were available on supported hardware (VGA-equipped PCs). The shell is very much like a DOS version of File Manager found in Windows up to versions 3.11 and NT 3.51, and File Explorer on later versions.

An early incarnation of DOS Shell, titled MS-DOS Manager, was bundled exclusively with the Eazy PC, an IBM PC clone manufactured by Zenith Data Systems in 1987.

In MS-DOS 4.x and 5.x, the program was implemented as COM file (codice_1). In MS-DOS 6 the executable had an .EXE filename extension (codice_2).

==Features==
The shell includes common features seen in other file managers such as copying, moving and renaming files as well as the ability to launch applications with a double-click. The shell could be run by the command &quot;codice_3&quot;. It had the ability to set simple colours and styles.

The shell also has a help system, a program list, and a task swapper. Like many modern file managers, it had the ability to display dual hierarchy directory and file lists, i.e. left and right panes, displaying both a list of directory contents and the hierarchical file path to the current working directory. A mouse was supported, however, like any other DOS application, it required an appropriate device driver.

One feature was the ability to list all files on a hard drive in a single alphabetized list along with the path and other attributes. This permitted the user to compare versions of a file in different directories by their attributes and easily spot duplicates.

==Shortcomings==
DOS Shell was incapable of full multitasking. It supported rudimentary task switching; it could switch between programs running in memory, at the cost of performance hit. However, all the running programs had to fit into conventional memory area, as there was no support for swapping to disk.

In time, Windows 3.1x, with its own graphical user interface, became much more popular among computer users. Windows was capable of multitasking. System performance was much higher, with complete access to extended memory.

<text>[[KwaDukuza Local Municipality|KwaDukuza]], previously known as Stanger, is a town in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In 2006, the municipal name was changed to KwaDukuza (which incorporates towns such as Stanger, Ballito and Shakaskraal), but the Zulu people in the area called it &quot;Dukuza&quot; well before then.

The city has undergone minor economic construction since 2015, having built a multi-million rand regional shopping mall in 2018. KwaDukuza also has a college called North Coast Agricultural College located in Shakaskraal.

==History==
The town was founded in about 1820 by King Shaka and was named KwaDukuza () because of the capital&#x27;s labyrinth of huts. After Shaka was assassinated on 22 September 1828 during a coup by two of his half-brothers, Dingane and Umthlangana (Mhlangane), the city was burnt to the ground. In 1873, European settlers built a town on the site, naming it Stanger after William Stanger, the surveyor-general of Natal.

Stanger became a municipality in 1949 and is the commercial, magisterial and railway centre of an important sugar-producing district. A small museum adjoins the site of Shaka&#x27;s grave, a grain pit in the city centre. The city and its vibrant inhabitants are surrounded by sugar cane fields, bush and the mahogany tree where Shaka held meetings, which still stands in front of the municipal offices. The Shaka Day festival, a colourful ceremony of 10,000 or more Zulus, is held at the KwaDukuza Recreation Grounds on 24 September every year. The festival is usually attended by dignitaries to mark the significance of the Zulu nation.

In 2006, the Minister of Arts and Culture approved a name change from Stanger to KwaDukuza, which was published in the &quot;Government Gazette of South Africa&quot; on 3 March 2006.

The KwaDukuza Museum houses historical items and information on Shaka, the sugar industry and local history. The town has a South Asian influence because of the influx of labourers from India in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries for sugarcane barons, such as Liege Hulett. The first few hundred Indian families left Port Natal for the cane farms on 17 November 1860. The importation of Indian labourers was stopped in 1911, when their numbers exceeded 100,000. Most Indians did not return when their work contracts expired, but exchanged their return-trip passes for money or property. The growth of the Indian community changed the economic and cultural nature of the town and has successfully developed it into what it is today. Celebrations include Diwali and the Winter Fair, the latter being a fundraiser for child welfare. 

In July, 2021, the town was significantly impacted by large scale looting, vandalism, property damage and civil unrest caused during the 2021 South African unrest, much to the dismay of the Indian population.
== Law and government ==

KwaDukuza forms part of the KwaDukuza Local Municipality and the larger iLembe District Municipality, serving as the seat for both municipalities. It has a Magistrate&#x27;s Court and most central and provincial government departments maintain regional branches or other offices in the town.

== Geography ==
Located on the hilly North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, KwaDukuza lies approximately 73 km (45 mi) north-west of Durban and 106 km (67 mi) south-west of Richards Bay. Morevover, the town is situated 8 kilometres (5 miles) inland from Blythedale Beach on the Mbozamo River. 

The nearest settlements to KwaDukuza other than Blythedale Beach include Darnall (12 km), Shakaskraal (16 km), Tinley Manor Beach (18 km), Zinkwazi Beach (21 km) and Ballito (30 km).

===Healthcare===
KwaDukuza has of two major hospitals, General Justice Gizenga Mpanza Regional Hospital, in the city centre which serves as iLembe&#x27;s largest and main public hospital and the KwaDukuza Private Hospital, on the southern outskirts of the city which was opened in February 2018. Other than hospitals, KwaDukuza has three public clinics which fall under the jurisdiction of the General Justice Gizenga Mpanza Regional Hospital, including Glenhills Clinic, to the west of the city, KwaDukuza Clinic, just south of the city centre and the Nandi Clinic, north of the city.

=== Transport ===
==== Rail ====
KwaDukuza is located at the northern end of the &quot;North Coast Line&quot;, which is served by the commuter rail network, Metrorail KwaZulu-Natal and runs down south to Durban via Groutville, Shakaskraal, Umhlali, oThongathi (Tongaat), Verulam and Mount Edgecombe.

==== Roads ====
KwaDukuza lies just off the N2 highway between Empangeni and Durban. Furthermore, it is intersected by the R74, connecting the N2 to the east with Greytown to the north-west. The R102 connects the city via Groutville and Shakaskraal to oThongathi in the south and via Darnall to KwaGingindlovu in the north. Running east, a small road connects the R74 (at the interchange with the N2) with the coastal village of Blythedale Beach. 

===== Tolling =====
The N2 is the main route forming the North Coast Toll Route (between eMdloti and Empangeni) which involves payment of toll: Traffic approaching KwaDukuza from the south and traffic heading south on the N2 (in the direction of Durban) must pass through the Mvoti Toll Plaza, about 10 kilometres (6 mi) south of the city. The R102 between Shakaskraal and KwaDukuza serves as an untolled alternative route to the N2 to avoid the Mvoti Toll Plaza.

<text>In United States law, a  (Latin for &#x27;suit pending&#x27; ) is a written notice that a lawsuit has been filed concerning real estate, involving either the title to the property or a claimed ownership interest in it. The notice is usually filed in the county land records office. Recording a against a piece of property alerts a potential purchaser or lender that the property’s title is in question, which makes the property less attractive to a buyer or lender. Once the notice is filed, the legal title of anyone who purchases the land or property described in the notice is subject to the outcome of the lawsuit.

== Genesis and usages ==
 may refer to any pending lawsuit or to a specific situation with a public notice of litigation that has been recorded in the same location where the title of real property has been recorded. This notice secures a plaintiff&#x27;s claim on the property so that a sale, mortgage, or encumbrance of the property will not diminish the plaintiff&#x27;s rights to the property, should the plaintiff prevail in its case. In some jurisdictions, when the notice is properly recorded, is considered constructive notice to other litigants or other unrecorded or subordinate lienholders.

The recording office will record a upon request of anyone who claims to be entitled to do so (such as because the person has filed a lawsuit). If someone else with an interest in the property (such as the owner) believes the is not proper, then he can then file suit to have it expunged.

Some states have statutes which require the filer of the notice—in the event of a challenge to the notice—to establish that it has probable cause or a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its case in the underlying lawsuit. Other states do not have such a requirement.

== History ==
Under the common law, the mere existence of a lawsuit potentially affecting the title to real property had the legal effect of putting the entire world on constructive notice of the suit; anyone acquiring an interest in real property which was the subject of a pending suit took that interest subject to the litigants&#x27; rights as they might be eventually determined, no matter how much later. In effect, nothing relating to the ownership of the subject matter of the suit could be definitively changed while the suit was pending. Without publication of the existence of a lawsuit, innocent buyers might discover the existence of a lawsuit too late.

The harsh effect of this rule, and its effect on innocent purchasers, led many jurisdictions to enact statutes requiring a written notice, usually recorded in the land records where the real estate is located, for the notice provisions of the rule to be effective. Typically, a separate recorded instrument is required by statute if the lawsuit in question affects title to real property. If the statutory requirements are met, the world is put on &quot;constructive notice&quot; of the existence of the suit, and any person acquiring an interest later does so subject to the outcome of the suit.

== Effect ==
 is taken as constructive notice of the pending lawsuit, and it places a cloud on the title of the property in question until the suit is resolved and the notice released or the is expunged. Careful buyers will be unwilling to purchase land subject to a or will only purchase the land at a discount, prudent lenders will not lend money against the security of the land, and title insurance companies will not insure the title to such land. Title is taken subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. Because so much real property is purchased with borrowed money, this usually keeps the owner from selling the property. It also may keep the owner from borrowing money secured by the property (such as to pay the costs of defending the suit).

It is important to note that the presence of a does &quot;not&quot; prevent or necessarily invalidate a transfer of the property, although it makes such a transfer subject to the outcome of the litigation. Thus, the owner is not prevented from selling the land for (non-borrowed) cash, pledging it as security for a speculative loan, or giving it away, all subject to the outcome of the lawsuit. Once the is recorded, however, the recipient (a &quot;purchaser&quot; or &quot;grantee &quot;) would be deemed to have notice of the litigation and might lose their title to the property if the plaintiff&#x27;s suit prevails.

While it is generally thought of in connection with real property (land, buildings, and the like), the doctrine of also applies to personal property. Frequently, statutes only apply to real property, so the common-law doctrine probably still applies to personal property.
