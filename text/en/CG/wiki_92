<text>William Henry Bailey (January 22, 1831 – August 17, 1908) was an American author, lawyer, and politician. He was the North Carolina Attorney General and served in the North Carolina General Assembly. He co-founded and taught law at the Bailey Law School.

== Early life ==
Bailey was born at Mt.Pleasant in Pasquotank County, North Carolina. His parents were Priscilla Elizabeth Brownrigg and John Lancaster Bailey. His father was a member of the North Carolina House and Senate, a North Carolina Superior Court judge. In the early 1840s, the family moved to Hillsborough, North Carolina where his father practiced law.

Bailey attended the Bingham School and the Caldwell Institute in Hillsborough, North Carolina. He attended the University of North Carolina. He studied law under his father. 

== Career ==
Bailey received his law license in 1851 and received his license to practice before the North Carolina Supreme Court in January 1852. He practiced law in Hillsborough with his father. He was appointed the secretary at the North Carolina Democratic Party at its convention in May 1952. 

He became the Attorney General of North Carolina in December 1856, completing an unexpired term. In April 1858, he moved his law practice to Yanceyville, North Carolina, but continued to serve courts in Orange, Alamance and Caswell Counties. He was elected the county attorney for Caswell County in 1858. In 1859 or 1860, he moved to Black Mountain, North Carolina with his father and opened the Bailey Law School. For a time, he joined the faculty of the school but it was primarily his father&#x27;s venture.

On April 24, 1861, Bailey enlisted with the Bethel Regiment, First North Carolina Volunteers as a private. He fought at the Battle of Bethel Church and First Battle of Bull Run. Later, he was a judge advocate.

After the war, Bailey practiced law in Salisbury, North Carolina for ten years starting in early 1865. He also wanted to start a law school there, advertising that he had thirteen years of experience as a law teacher. He joined Nathaniel Boydon in the firm Boyden and Blackman. When Boydon was appointed to the North Carolina Supreme Court, Bailey joined the practice of James M. McCorkle. Governor William Woods Holden appointed Bailey to the position of state code commissioner on August 31, 1871. Bailey held this position until the post was eliminated in 1873. 

In the fall of 1874, Bailey moved to Charlotte, North Carolina and practiced law with William Marcus Shipp. Shipp had just finished his term as North Carolina Attorney General and was a North Carolina Superior Court judge. Bailey formed a law partnership with former governor and United States Senator Zebulon Vance.Vance in June 1881. In 1882, Bailey was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives for Mecklenburg County as a Democrat in 1882. While in the legislature, he chaired the judiciary committee. 

Bailey wrote several books, including &quot;The Effect of Civil War upon the Rights of Persons and Property&quot; and &quot;Conflict of Judicial Decisions&quot;. He received an honorary Doctor of Law degree in 1885 from Rutherford College.

== Personal life ==
Bailey married Anne Chamberlain Howerton of Hillsborough on October 20, 1852. They had five children, daughter Mrs. Archibald Lingan and sons William Henry Bailey Jr. Edmund H. Bailey, Campbell McCulloh Bailey, and Thomas H. Bailey. 

He was a Mason and an Episcopalian.

In 1890, he retired and moved to Texas where his sons lived; he resided in Seabrook. On August 17, 1908, Bailey died at his son&#x27;s home in Seabrook at the age of 77. He was interred in Glenwood Cemetery in Houston, Texas.

<text>Helicon is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the north part of the Mare Imbrium. The crater was named after 4th century BC Greek astronomer Helicon of Cyzicus, a friend and disciple of Plato. To the northwest is the prominent Sinus Iridum, a mountain-ringed bay on the mare. Just to the east is the slightly smaller crater Le Verrier.

Helicon is a nearly circular formation with inner walls that curve down to a relatively flat floor. There is a tiny craterlet located at the midpoint of the interior, and a small craterlet along the southwestern rim.

==Satellite craters==
According to convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Helicon.

<doc id="1003614" wikidata="Q578015" url="?curid=1003614" title="Mounted police">
<text>Mounted police are police who patrol on horseback or camelback. Their day-to-day function is typically picturesque or ceremonial, but they are also employed in crowd control because of their mobile mass and height advantage and increasingly in the UK for crime prevention and high visibility policing roles. The added height and visibility that the horses give their riders allows officers to observe a wider area, and it also allows people in the wider area to see the officers, which helps deter crime and helps people find officers when they need them. When employed for crowd control, there is a risk that some people may be trampled (resulting in injuries or death). The officer riding the horse might or might not be held legally responsible for injuries depending upon the totality of the circumstances. 

Mounted police may be employed for specialized duties ranging from patrol of parks and wilderness areas, where police cars would be impractical or noisy, to riot duty, where the horse serves to intimidate those whom it is desired to disperse through its larger size, or may be sent in to detain trouble makers or offenders from the crowd. For example, in the UK, mounted police are most often seen at football matches, although they are also a common sight on the streets of many towns and cities as a visible police presence and crime deterrent during the day and night. Some mounted police units are trained in search and rescue due to the horse&#x27;s ability to travel where vehicles cannot.

== History ==
The French Maréchaussée—direct predecessors of the gendarmerie and the first national police force in a modern sense—were a corps of completely mounted constabulary from their establishment in the early 18th century. Poor roads and extensive rural areas made horse-mounted police a necessity in European states until the early 20th century.

The establishment of organized law-enforcement bodies throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas during the colonial and post-colonial eras made the concept of predominantly horse-police accepted almost world-wide. Notable examples include the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Mexican Rurales, the Rhodesian British South Africa Police, the Turkish/Cypriot Zapiteh and the &quot;caballeria&quot; (mounted branch) of the Spanish Civil Guard.

== Equipment ==

Tack used by mounted police is similar to standard riding tack, with adaptations for police use. Synthetic saddles are often favored over those made of natural leather to reduce weight, important both because of long riding hours and because police officers must carry numerous articles of personal equipment. High-traction horseshoes made of speciality metals or fitted with rubber soles are typically used in urban areas in place of standard steel horseshoes, which are prone to slip on pavement. Rubber soled shoes also produce less noise than steel shoes and jar the hoof less.

Horses working in riot control wear facial armor, made of perspex so that the animals can still see. The officers themselves are often equipped with especially long wooden or polycarbonate batons for use on horseback, as standard patrol batons would have insufficient length to strike individuals at ground level.

==Notable modern units==
===Australia===
Australia, being a large country and not densely populated, commonly used mounted police in order to traverse the country side. All of the Mounted police units were formed in the 19th century and have continued to this day, excepting Tasmania.

* The New South Wales Mounted Police is a mounted section of the New South Wales Police Force, and the oldest continuous mounted group in the world, formed in 7 September 1825. Currently they have a strength of 36 officers and around 38 mounts and their duties include traffic and crowd management, patrols, and ceremonial protocol duties.
* The &quot;Mounted Branch&quot;, or The Victorian Police Mounted Branch was formed in 1838 as the Mounted Police Fifth Division which consisted of soldiers from infantry regiments. The Unit has 26 officers and more than 20 mounts.
* The Western Australian Mounted Police Branch was formed in 1834 and continues operation to this day. It is the second oldest Mounted police Branch in the world after that of New South Wales.
* The Mounted Police of the South Australian Police force, known as &quot;The Greys&quot; due to the fact they only use grey horses, dates back to the start of the state&#x27;s police force when it was originally formed of half mounted and half foot police, in 1838. The Mounted police also used Camels up until 1951.
* Tasmanian Police used horses for riding and teams of Tasmanian Tigers pull sleds through Alpine (high country) territory in Winter. Both sleds and horses were dropped in favour of motorbikes, when the Police department purchased 84 departmentally owned motorcycle and sidecar units during late 1935 early 1936.
* The Northern Territory Police has a mounted unit, which dates back to the late 19th century.

===Canada===

Mounted police units were used in Canada during the 19th century to carry out peace officer duties across vast and sparsely inhabited areas. The predecessors to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Royal North-West Mounted Police, relied on using mounted riders from its inception in 1873 to carry out their policing duties across the Prairies. These mounted police were frequently the only government officials in the area. 

Police services in Montreal and Toronto also formed their own mounted police units in the 1880s to cover larger areas in their cities. The Service de police de la Ville de Montréal formed its cavalry unit in 1885 to patrol several roads and park and act as an express mail service between the service&#x27;s stations. The Toronto Police Service formed its mounted unit in 1886 to provide a police presence in outlying areas of the city that seldom saw police prior to the unit&#x27;s introduction. Both services also used their mounted units to enforce traffic laws during the early advent of automobilies.

The RNWMP&#x27;s reliance on mounted police units declined significantly after the First World War due to automobiles. Although the RCMP&#x27;s increasingly relied on motorised vehicles for its work in the 1920s and 1930s, equestrian training remained a centrepiece of its recruit training regimen at RCMP Training Academy until 1966. , the RCMP maintains a single troop of 32 riders, the Musical Ride. However, they are an equestrian showcase unit that does not perform any regular police duties.

Municipal police services continued to use mounted police in the 1920s and 1930s for crowd management duties, with the Toronto Police Service and Vancouver Police Department&#x27;s mounted units growing in size during the Great Depression due to the increasing demonstrations and riots taking place. Toronto and Vancouver&#x27;s mounted units also saw siginicant use for crowd control during the 1960s and 1970s.

Police services in Calgary, Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver continue to maintain mounted units for community patrols and crowd management at large events. , the Toronto Police Service Mounted Unit is Canada’s largest mounted police unit that performs operational duties, made up of 24 horses. Toronto&#x27;s mounted police unit is primarily tasked with community patrols, although they also conduct vehicular stops, assist with searches, and provide crowd management support, particularly in the city’s Entertainment District.

===India===
The Kolkata Police maintain the Kolkata Mounted Police force which was established in 1840. As of 2024, it has a strength of 2 inspectors, one sergeant-major, 10 sergeants, one JCO, five head sowars, 85 sowars and 98 syces. The force operates 68 horses under 2 stables (one on S N Banerjee Road with a capacity of 70 and the other in Diamond Harbour with 32 horses). The force is deployed currently to regulate crowds in Maidan area in sporting and other events and also showcased in ceremonial events like Republic Day parade in front of Raj Bhavan.

===Oman===
The Royal Oman Police have many horse- and camel-mounted troopers.

===United Kingdom===

There are thirteen mounted police sections in the UK. The mounted sections support policing in specialist operations, major incidents, and anti-social behaviour. A mounted officer&#x27;s responsibilities may include liaising with rural and urban communities on horseback or situations that may attract large crowds such as at sporting and cultural events or at demonstrations. Mounted sections also participate in ceremonial duties. The Bow Street Horse Patrol, founded in 1763, are the oldest uniformed police force in the world. They were formally incorporated into the Metropolitan Police in 1836. Today the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch is the mounted section of the Metropolitan Police, the police force of Greater London (excluding the City of London, where the separate City of London Police has its own mounted branch). The Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch undertakes crowd control duties, especially at football matches, but also conducts general street patrols and escorts the Royal Guard change at the London&#x27;s royal residences.
===United States===

Many cities in the United States have mounted units, New York having one of the largest with 55 horses as of 2016, The Houston, Texas Police Department&#x27;s Mounted Patrol Unit was started in 1983 and now consists of 1 lieutenant, 4 sergeants and 24 officers. It has become increasingly well known due to the decision to remove the shoes of all its 38 mounted horses and embrace the concept of naturalizing their horses&#x27; diet and care.

Several American mounted units were disbanded or downsized in the 2010s. For example, units in Boston and San Diego were disbanded by 2011, while New York City’s mounted unit was reduced considerably over the last decade with 79 police officers and 60 horses in 2011 – down from the 130 officers and 125 horses it had before the downsizing. Philadelphia&#x27;s mounted police unit was disbanded in 2004, but reinstated in 2011 with four horses from the disbanding unit of Newark, New Jersey.

The United States Border Patrol had 200 horses in 2005. Most of these are employed along the U.S.–Mexico border. In Arizona, these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

<text>Gagarin is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. To the southwest is the crater Pavlov and to the northeast lies Keeler. Closer to the rim are the craters Levi-Civita to the southwest, and Beijerinck to the north-northeast. Isaev lies entirely within the northwest rim of Gagarin. In contrast with the floor of Gagarin, Isaev has a floor with a somewhat low albedo.

==Physical characteristics==

The crater is named after Yuri Gagarin, the cosmonaut who was the first human in space and the first to orbit the Earth. The six craters falling within the perimeter of Gagarin have also been named after pioneers of Russian aviation and astronautics, including Isaev, Grave, Balandin, Raspletin, Kosberg, and Andronov.

Gagarin has been heavily eroded by a long history of crater impacts. The worn rim forms a low, circular ridge around the somewhat bowl-shaped interior. The inner floor is covered by a multitude of crater impacts of various dimensions. Little if anything remains of a central ridge, if the crater ever possessed such a feature.

=== Satellite craters ===
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Gagarin.

<text>Doppler is a lunar impact crater named for Christian Doppler that is located at the southern edge of the walled plain Korolev, on the far side of the Moon. To the east are the craters Das and Galois. Farther to the southwest of Doppler is Mohorovičić.

The rim of Doppler has a somewhat polygonal form, and a smaller crater is joined with the inner side of the northeast wall. The interior of Doppler is rough and irregular, with some of the worn outer walls, and a complex of central hills to the north of the midpoint. The crater Doppler B lies within the northern rim, and occupies a portion of the northern floor. A small, crater-formed valley runs to the southeast across the floor of Doppler from the rim of Doppler B.

<text>Charles Henry Baldwin (September 3, 1822 – November 17, 1888) was an officer in the United States Navy, who served during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, he joined the Navy on April 24, 1839, and served as a midshipman aboard the frigate (1839–40) and the sloop (1840–43) in the Mediterranean Squadron, before returning to the U.S. aboard the sloop in 1843 to attend the Naval School at Philadelphia, graduating with the rank of passed midshipman on July 2, 1845.

He served through the Mexican–American War on the frigate in the Pacific Squadron, serving on operations around Mazatlán, during the time that it was occupied by U.S. naval forces between November 1847 to June 1848. He received his commission as lieutenant in November 1853, but left the Navy on February 28, 1854.

Baldwin re-entered the naval service in 1861, on the outbreak of the Civil War, with the rank of acting-lieutenant. In February 1862 he commissioned the steamer , and sailed from New York to Ship Island for duty with the Mortar Flotilla of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. In April, during the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, &quot;Clifton&quot; towed 21 mortar schooners into the Mississippi River, and supported them as they bombarded the fortifications below New Orleans. The next month, after the capture of the city, the ship sailed upriver to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where it was damaged by enemy gunfire.

Baldwin was promoted to commander in November 1862, given command of the steamer in early 1863 and ordered to hunt down the notorious Confederate commerce raider . Over the next year Baldwin took his ship to the West Indies, the eastern coast of South America, the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, Spain and Portugal, but his quarry always eluded him, sometimes only by a few hours. During the voyage &quot;Vanderbilt&quot; also served as the flagship of Commodore Charles Wilkes Flying Squadron in the West Indies, and captured several British blockade runners, including the . Baldwin eventually returned to New York in January 1864 without ever having sighted the Confederate vessel.

He was then assigned to ordnance duty, serving at the Mare Island Navy Yard in California until 1867. He returned to sea as the Fleet Captain of the North Pacific Squadron in 1868–1869, and received promotion to the rank of captain in 1869. He then served as the Inspector of Ordnance at Mare Island from 1869 to 1871, and commanded the frigate , flagship of the Asiatic Squadron in 1871–1873. He was commander of the Naval Rendezvous (recruitment station) at San Francisco in 1873, and was commissioned as commodore on August 8, 1876, serving as a Member of the Board of Examiners from 1876 to 1879.

In early 1883 Baldwin was promoted to rear admiral, and assumed command of the European Squadron on 10 March. He then sailed to Kronstadt in his flagship , and on 27 May he and his staff attended the coronation of Tsar Alexander III in Moscow.

==Personal life==
Charles Henry Baldwin was married to a Caroline Permelia Tolfree (1835–1873), by whom he had two children: Charles Adolphe Baldwin (1861–1934) and Florence Baldwin (1859–1918). In 1875, Baldwin married Mary H. Morgan (died 1924). His daughter Florence married Edward Parker Deacon in 1879. Their eldest daughter, Gladys Marie Deacon, married Charles Richard John Spencer-Churchill (1871–1934), the 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1921 who then became the Duchess of Marlborough.

<text>The concept of a mutant is a common trope in comic books and science fiction. The new phenotypes that appear in fictional mutations generally go far beyond what is typically seen in biological mutants and often result in the mutated life form exhibiting superhuman abilities or qualities.

==DC Comics==

In DC Comics, the term was first used in the 1980s by a fictitious race of extraterrestrials known as the Dominators when they appeared in the &quot;Invasion!&quot; mini-series.

For instance, Captain Comet manifested his powers at birth when a comet activated his &quot;metagene&quot;, gaining his abilities by the time he was eight.

==Marvel Comics==
In Marvel Comics, genetic mutation has been used as an explanation for super-powers since the 1950s. Mutants have played a major role in Marvel Comics, particularly the X-Men and related series. In the Marvel Comics Universe, they are a heavily persecuted minority where most people fear and hate them. Marvel Comics redefines the term to beings who are in a higher stage of evolution known as &quot;Homo superior&quot; and are not yet accepted by the human race. Other terrestrial and alien races, as well as robots, have also exhibited mutations and have joined the X-Men, including Ariel, Danger, and Warlock. 

Marvel Comics makes clear distinctions between mutants and &#x27;mutates&#x27;, beings who have their genetic code manipulated by other means, such as Spider-Man or Cloak and Dagger.

==Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles==
In the universe of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Mutants are essentially creatures with the genetic traits of two different animals. Usually, the mutations are caused by interaction with Mutagen, an alien ooze.

==In other media==

===Literature===
* In &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; (1952) by Isaac Asimov, a &quot;mutant&quot; named The Mule possesses the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others. He uses this unique ability to subjugate people in his attempt to conquer the galaxy.
*&quot;Children of the Atom&quot; (1953) by Wilmar H. Shiras. The children of workers who were exposed to a radioactive explosion give birth to children with a high intelligence.
* In &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, the mutants bred by the Capitol are called &quot;muttations&quot; or “mutts”. They include jabberjays, birds that can copy speech, tracker jackers, a vicious wasp specimen, orange monkeys with claws like switchblades, and wolf mutts, creatures with humanoid faces to mock the previous who died in the 74th Hunger Games. Also, there are mockingjays, hybrids of jabberjays and mockingbirds that can copy songs.
* In &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; by science fiction author John Wyndham, a post-apocalyptic, fundamentalist society views genetic mutation as a blasphemy and the work of the Devil; not realizing it is the result of radiation from a world-wide nuclear war that occurred over a thousand years before. In order to prevent another tribulation, they follow a strict eugenics policy. Individuals considered deviations are either killed or sterilized and banished. The protagonist, a boy named David, can communicate telepathically with a small group of other children. However, David and his friends must keep their abnormal abilities secret or risk death or banishment.
* In the espionage novel &quot;Performance Anomalies&quot;, by Victor Robert Lee, the protagonist Cono 7Q is investigated by geneticists at Stanford University who determine that his accelerated nervous system is due to mutations on the long (q) arm of his seventh chromosome. They cite mutations in the brain-related genes &quot;timeless&quot;, &quot;FoxP2&quot;, and &quot;STX1A,&quot; and perhaps others as underlying Cono 7Q&#x27;s ability to perceive high-speed events and react to them with a rapidity not seen in normal humans.

==Television==
* Leela in the animated sitcom series Futurama initially believes herself to be an alien, but discovers in the season 4 episode Leela&#x27;s Homeworld that she&#x27;s actually a mutated human; being the least unusual-looking of any mutant on 31st century Earth (where mutants are shunned and forced to live underground), her parents sent her into New New York as an infant with a fake backstory painting her as an alien of unknown origin.
* In X-Men: The Animated Series the X-Men are a group of Mutants who are superheroes, who are outcasts with extraordinary powers protecting the world that fears and hates them. 
* In X-Men: Evolution the X-Men are now teenagers instead of adults in the season finale Jean becomes possessed by Phoenix and the X-Men grow up.
* In Power Rangers Time Force the Evil warlord Ransik and his daughter Nadira are a group of mutants who are evil with monsters but the Time Force police track them, with teenager Wesley Collins who is billionaire of Mr. Collins, they defeat the mutant monsters in every episode of the show.

===Films===
* In &quot;Total Recall&quot;, the early settlers of Mars who were exposed to space radiations because of cheaply-made domes gave birth to mutants, and many of them have gained supernatural powers, including psychic ability. The mutants fight against the forces of planetary administrator Vilos Cohaagen, and organized a rebellion led by Kuato, a humanoid psychic who hides in the belly of his conjoined brother.
* In the remake series of &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, the Mutants or Hill People are humans with misshapen bodies due to radiation exposure from nuclear weapons testing.
* In the &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; franchise, the Odet family are a mutated clan of incestuous cannibals whose bodies have been physically altered by toxic waste. 
* In &quot;Chernobyl Diaries&quot;, the Mutants were the results of humans exposed to the radiation leaked during the Chernobyl disaster. The Ukrainian government has been keeping quiet about the incident and would often dispose of any surviving witnesses by locking them up in a room containing one of the mutants as seen at the end of the movie.
* In &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, set in a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the Angel Gang is composed of religious and cannibalistic mutants affected by the radiations of the atomic wars. In the 2012 reboot the parents of Cassandra Anderson died of cancer from the exposure to the Cursed Earth&#x27;s radiations while she was born physically healthy with innate telepathic powers, which granted her the recruitment in the Justice Department, since mutants are generally banned from becoming Judges.
* The Mutants are among the creatures that appear in &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot;. When it came to the five college students finding the assortment of different items in the basement, one of them contains a gas mask and tonics that if tampered with can summon the Mutants. The Demolitions Department of the Facility bets on them.
* In &quot;Pandorum&quot;, the &quot;Hunters&quot; are revealed to be the mutated offspring of the passengers of a deteriorating generation ship that have been prematurely awakened from suspended animation and forced to cannibalism. The mutation is attributed to an enzyme the passengers were given which was intended to help them adapt to the life on a new planet, instead they adapted to the savage conditions on the dark ship, making them similar to the Morlocks.
* In &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, mutants are the children of the survivors of the nuclear holocaust that turned the Earth into the planet of the apes, and they live under the Forbidden Zone and worship the Alpha-Omega bomb, a doomsday device. Due to the radiation exposure, the mutants developed telepathic powers which they use to create hallucinations to scare the apes off and alternatively force their prisoners to fight to death against their will.
* In &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; and the animated Toxic Crusaders cartoon, &quot;Toxie&quot; and his friends are deformed mutants of super-human size and strength whose mutations are the results of exposure to toxic waste, radiation, and other environmental pollutants.
* In the Bollywood film &quot;Krrish 3&quot;, many mutants appeared. These mutants were called Maanvars, created by an evil scientist named Kaal.
* In &quot;Sign Gene: The First Deaf Superheroes&quot;, the mutants happened to be deaf and have superhuman powers through the use of sign language. The leading character Tom Clerc is the fourth great-grandson of the legendary Laurent Clerc, the father of American Sign Language.
* In the 1955 science fiction film &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, the character Exeter is badly injured by a Mutant while fleeing the planet Metaluna aboard a flying saucer, accompanied by other characters Cal and Ruth. The Mutant has also boarded the saucer and attacks Ruth, but dies as a result of pressure differences on the journey back to Earth.

===Print media===
* A December, 1953 article in &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; Magazine called &quot;How Nuclear Radiation Can Change Our Race&quot;, warned that in the event of an &quot;Atom War&quot;, a mutant species of supermen might arise to assist—or to dominate—humanity. The article was written by &quot;O. O. Binder&quot;, and opened with a two-page illustration drawn by comic book artist Kurt Schaffenberger, which shows bald, large-craniumed mutants either helping humanity with their superior intellects (in a small section of the picture) or dominating mankind as slavemasters (in the much bigger splash image).
* The &quot;Mutant Chronicle&quot; novels are based on a tabletop role-playing game originally published in 1993. It was made into a film (which has very little to do with the novels or the RPG) entitled &quot;Mutant Chronicles&quot; in 2009.

<doc id="1003640" wikidata="Q1020967" url="?curid=1003640" title="Bürg (crater)">
<text>Bürg is a prominent lunar impact crater in the northeast part of the Moon. It lies within the lava-flooded, ruined crater formation designated Lacus Mortis. To the south and southeast is the crater pair Plana and Mason. To the west, beyond the rim of Lacus Mortis, is the prominent crater Eudoxus.

==Name==
Bürg is named for Austrian astronomer Johann Tobias Bürg, who discovered Antares&#x27;s companion star during an occultation event in 1819.

==Crater==
The rim of Bürg is nearly circular with relatively little wear. The interior is bowl-shaped, and there is a large central mountain at the midpoint. Along the crest of this mountain some observers have noted a small, crater-like pit. The crater has a ray system, and is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.

To the west is a rille system designated the Rimae Bürg, which spans a distance of about 100 kilometers.

It is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bürg.

<text>Ewoks, also known as Star Wars: Ewoks, is an animated series featuring the Ewok characters introduced in &quot;Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) and further discovered in &quot;Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure&quot; (1984) and its sequel &quot;&quot; (1985). The series was co-produced by Canada-based Nelvana Limited on behalf of Lucasfilm and broadcast on ABC, with its sister series &quot;Droids&quot; (as part of &quot;The Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour&quot;), and then by itself, as &quot;The All-New Ewoks&quot;.

==Premise==
The series centers on the adventures of Wicket W. Warrick and his friends on the forest moon of Endor before the events of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film and &quot;Caravan of Courage&quot;. The primary recurring villains are Morag the Tulgah Witch, who had a personal grudge against the tribe&#x27;s shaman, Master Logray, and the Duloks, a rival species.

The penultimate episode, &quot;Battle for the Sunstar&quot;, which was reaired as the series finale, shows the Ewok heroes leaving the forest moon&#x27;s surface when they go aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer that has traveled to their system. An Imperial scientist attempts to destroy the Emperor, whose shuttle makes an appearance. The episode has been noted as forming a link with &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, which features the Empire using Endor as its base of operations for the second Death Star.

==Cast and characters==
===The Ewok tribe===
====Warrick family====
* Wicket Wystri Warrick (voiced by Jim Henshaw then Denny Delk) – The youngest brother of the Warrick Family. He is headstrong and determined and often takes the initiative. Wicket really wants to be a great warrior, which often gets him into trouble. Has dark brown fur and wears an orange hood, but wears a green hood in season two.
* Widdle &quot;Willy&quot; Warrick (voiced by John Stocker) – The middle brother of the Warrick Family. Originally called Widdle. He is clumsy, gluttonous and overweight, but exceedingly nice.
* Weechee Warrick (voiced by Greg Swanson) – The eldest brother and the strongest of the Warrick Family.
* Winda Warrick – The youngest child of the Warrick Family.

* Erpham Warrick (voiced by Anthony Parr) – Wicket&#x27;s great-grandfather, once a great warrior for the Ewok tribe and is still looked up to by young Ewoks. Not much is known about Erpham, as he died years ago, but he makes a brief appearance as a ghost when Wicket tries to repair his old battle wagon and instructs him. He was a golden-colored Ewok with a green hood.

====Kintaka family====
* Princess Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka (voiced by Cree Summer then Jeanne Reynolds) – Younger daughter of Chief Chirpa and Ra-Lee.

* Paploo (voiced by Paul Chato) – Kneesaa&#x27;s cousin, Great Chief Chirpa&#x27;s nephew and son to Bozzie. He is close friends with Wicket and Teebo. He sometimes joins in when the young Ewoks go on their adventures. He is older, but often acts with less maturity than the younger Ewoks. Has grey fur, with a white face and wears an orange hood with a feather.

* Ploob - A one-time character from the episode &quot;Horville&#x27;s Hut of Horrors&quot; is a floating green monster that frightens the Ewoks as well as steals their honey and jam. Arguably, his name may be &quot;Poob&quot;, but was proven by a court of peers led by American streamer and YouTuber DougDoug and the author, Paul Dini, himself, to be Ploob.

==Production==
The series is a follow-up (later stated to be a prequel) to the two &quot;Ewok&quot; films: &quot;Caravan of Courage&quot; (1984) and &quot;&quot; (1985), which were themselves spin-offs (and prequels) of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The first season of the series was somewhat sophisticated, but in the second, the writing and visual style were both simplified.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1985)===
The theme song for the first season was written and performed by Taj and Inshirah Mahal.
===Season 2 (1986)===
With this season, advertised as &quot;The All-New Ewoks&quot;, episodes are now shorted the 11-minute format meaning two segments per half-hour (with the exceptions of &quot;The Raich&quot;, &quot;Night of the Stranger&quot;, &quot;The Season Scepter&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Sunstar&quot;). This season introduced a new theme song, &quot;Friends Together, Friends Forever&quot;, written and performed by Patrick Gleeson.
==Broadcast and home media==
&quot;Ewoks&quot; was broadcast on ABC, originally with its sister series &quot;Droids&quot; (as part of &quot;The Ewoks and Droids Adventure Hour&quot;), and then by itself, as &quot;The All-New Ewoks&quot;. The series ran for two seasons of 13 half-hour episodes between 1985 and 1986 and was later shown in reruns on Sci-Fi Channel&#x27;s Cartoon Quest.

Almost all of the episodes (except for &quot;The Three Lessons&quot; and &quot;Prow Beaten / Baga&#x27;s Rival&quot;) were released on VHS in the 1980s and 1990s, most notably the UK PAL releases over six cassettes (&quot;Ewoks&quot; 1–6), which had the opening sequences and credits edited out. On April 2, 2021, the entire series was released on Disney+.

During the making of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy, its producer, Rick McCallum, oversaw two direct-to-video compilation films, each compiled from four episodes of the series. The first, &quot;The Haunted Village&quot;, was released on VHS in 1997. The second, &quot;Tales from the Endor Woods&quot;, was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2004 on a DVD titled &quot;Star Wars: Animated Adventures – Ewoks&quot; (which also features &quot;The Haunted Village&quot;). The newer film includes narration from &quot;Adult Wicket&quot; (voiced by Alex Lindsay).
==Reception==
According to David Perlmutter, &quot;Ewoks&quot; was &quot;unremarkable both technically and creatively.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; says the series was made at a time when &quot;television executives had no idea what constituted good children&#x27;s animated television&quot;, comparing it to series like &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Snorks&quot;, or &quot;Care Bears&quot;. SyFy Wire calls the series &quot;more a marketing ploy for Lucasfilm than a worthwhile extension of the franchise ... designed to sell toys, cereals, and action figures&quot;, though mentions that it &quot;featured a few surprisingly entertaining installments that appealed to both parents and kids, particularly the penultimate episode, &#x27;Battle for the Sunstar.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==
Elements from the series are featured in &quot;Star Wars&quot; reference media, such as &quot;A Guide to the Star Wars Universe&quot; and the &quot;Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot;. A Dulok was shown on Coruscant in Chapter 21 of the 2D animated &quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003). &quot;Ewoks&quot; was excluded from canon status in 2014, but some elements appear in the canon &quot;Ultimate Star Wars&quot; (2015) and later reference books, as well as the canon web series &quot;Star Wars Forces of Destiny&quot; (2018).

The series&#x27; opening titles are briefly featured in an episode of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;″ fourth season (2022).

==Merchandising and media==
===Action figures===
In 1985, Kenner Products produced a series of action figures based on the series. A second wave of figures were prototyped but ultimately cancelled due to poor sales of the initial wave. Several previously released Ewok themed vehicles, play sets, and accessories were advertised on the card backs of the figures but were curiously never offered in Ewoks Cartoon branded packaging.

===Comics===
In 1985, Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel, published a bi-monthly &quot;Ewoks&quot; comic based on the animated series. It ran for two years, with a total of 14 issues. Like the TV series, it was aimed towards a younger audience and produced parallel to a comic spun off from &quot;Droids&quot;. Issue #10 of &quot;Ewoks&quot; continued the &quot;Lost in Time&quot; crossover story from &quot;Droids&quot; #4. Additionally, Spanish comics publisher Editorial Gepsa produced two-page &quot;Ewoks&quot; comics as part of an anthology series.

<text>Gustavo Adolfo Chacín (; born December 4, 1980) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros.

== Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays===
In 2004, Chacín led all minor leaguers with 18 wins, and was the 24th pitcher used by the Blue Jays, tying the team record set in the 2002 season.

Chacín began the 2004 campaign with the New Hampshire Fisher Cats of the Double–A Eastern League. He was 16–2 with 109 strikeouts and a 2.86 ERA in innings, having earned his promotion to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Triple–A International League after a 34-innings scoreless streak. With the Chiefs, Chacín posted a 2–0 record with 14 strikeouts and a 2.31 ERA in innings. Then, he was promoted to the major leagues for the first time and made his debut on September 20, 2004, against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Chacín allowed two earned runs on three hits over seven innings for the win, as Toronto beat the Yankees 6–3. In his second start, Chacín held the Baltimore Orioles to four hits and a run in seven innings, but took the loss. At the end of the season, he had compiled a 1–1 record with six strikeouts and a 2.57 ERA in 14 innings

At spring training in 2005, Chacín landed a spot in the Jays&#x27; starting rotation. He jumped out to a hot start, earning a record of 4–1 with 18 strikeouts and a 2.41 ERA over 32.2 innings through the month of April, and was selected the American League Rookie of the Month. In July, Chacín won five of his six starts, being named Rookie of the Month for the second time in the season. Chacín pitched and won the final game of the season for the Blue Jays against the Kansas City Royals with a solid line of innings, 7 hits allowed, 1 run, 1 walk, 3 strikeouts in the 7–2 Blue Jay win. Chacín finished the season with a record of 13–9 and 3.72 ERA in 34 starts. He collected 121 strikeouts in 203 innings. He finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting, netting two first place votes and fourteen total points, and was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team along with fellow Blue Jay Russ Adams.

Chacín finished his 2006 season 9–4 with a 5.05 ERA. He opened the 2007 season with Toronto, but was sent down to the minors by the end of April.

In 2008, Chacín spent the entire season with Toronto&#x27;s Single–A affiliate Dunedin Blue Jays. He finished the 2008 campaign at Dunedin with a 1-7 won-loss record, and a 7.88 ERA, and was granted free agency by the Blue Jays at the conclusion of the season.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

Chacín signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on December 23, 2008, but was released by that club at the conclusion of spring training. Only a few days later, Chacín signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies organization He split the 2009 season between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the Phillies&#x27; Triple–A affiliate, and the Double–A Reading Fightin Phils, compiling a cumulative 9–4 record and 3.20 ERA with 62 strikeouts across innings pitched.

===Houston Astros===
Chacin was signed to a minor-league contract by the Houston Astros on December 14, 2009. He also received an invitation to spring training.

On May 3, 2010, the Astros purchased the contract of Chacin from the Triple–A Round Rock Express of the Pacific Coast League. Previously, Chacin had been exclusively a starter in the majors; with Houston, he was used exclusively as a relief pitcher.

Chacín had his only major-league hit in a game against the Washington Nationals on the May 31, 2010, a solo home run off Nationals starter Luis Atilano. It was Chacín&#x27;s first major-league plate appearance in almost five years. It also proved to be the final at bat of his major-league career.

Chacin made 44 appearances for the Astros in 2010, all in relief. He went 2–2, with one save, and an ERA of 4.70. He did not make the 2011 club, however, and was sent down to the Triple-A Oklahoma City RedHawks. After going 3–6 with a 5.13 ERA, he was released by the Astros organization on July 14, 2011.

===New York Mets===
He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on July 16, 2011. The Mets assigned him to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He went 0–1 with the Bisons, compiling a 12.00 ERA in 15 innings of work, and was granted free agency after the season ended.

==Personal life==
Chacín cannot grow hair because of alopecia areata.

Gustavo Chacín and MLB pitcher Jhoulys Chacín are second cousins (once removed).

A joke on Toronto sports radio station Fan 590 that the name Chacín sounds like it should be the name of a cologne led the Blue Jays to do a &quot;Chacín Cologne Night&quot; on June 27, 2006.

Chacín was arrested on March 16, 2007, for driving under the influence in Tampa, Florida. He was stopped by Tampa Police at 3:43 a.m. ET and booked on the misdemeanor charge. Police reports indicated that Chacín&#x27;s blood alcohol level measured .150, above the legal limit of .08. The pitcher was released on a $500 bond.

<doc id="1003661" wikidata="Q749940" url="?curid=1003661" title="RTP Control Protocol">
<text>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a binary-encoded out-of-band signaling protocol that functions alongside the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). Its basic functionality and packet structure is defined in RFC 3550. RTCP provides statistics and control information for an RTP session. It partners with RTP in the delivery and packaging of multimedia data but does not transport any media data itself.

The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the quality of service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistics information such as transmitted octet and packet counts, packet loss, packet delay variation, and round-trip delay time to participants in a streaming multimedia session. An application may use this information to control quality of service parameters, perhaps by limiting flow, or using a different codec.

== Protocol functions ==
Typically RTP will be sent on an even-numbered UDP port, with RTCP messages being sent over the next higher odd-numbered port.

RTCP itself does not provide any flow encryption or authentication methods. Such mechanisms may be implemented, for example, with the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) defined in RFC 3711.

RTCP provides basic functions expected to be implemented in all RTP sessions:
*The primary function of RTCP is to gather statistics on quality aspects of the media distribution during a session and transmit this data to the session media source and other session participants. Such information may be used by the source for adaptive media encoding (codec) and detection of transmission faults. If the session is carried over a multicast network, this permits non-intrusive session quality monitoring.
*RTCP provides canonical end-point identifiers (CNAME) to all session participants. Although a source identifier (SSRC) of an RTP stream is expected to be unique, the instantaneous binding of source identifiers to end-points may change during a session. The CNAME establishes unique identification of end-points across an application instance (multiple use of media tools) and for third-party monitoring.
*Provisioning of session control functions. RTCP is a convenient means to reach all session participants, whereas RTP itself is not. RTP is only transmitted by a media source.

RTCP reports are expected to be sent by all participants, even in a multicast session which may involve thousands of recipients. Such traffic will increase proportionally with the number of participants. Thus, to avoid network congestion, the protocol must include session bandwidth management. This is achieved by dynamically controlling the frequency of report transmissions. RTCP bandwidth usage should generally not exceed 5% of the total session bandwidth. Furthermore, 25% of the RTCP bandwidth should be reserved to media sources at all times, so that in large conferences new participants can receive the CNAME identifiers of the senders without excessive delay.

The RTCP reporting interval is randomized to prevent unintended synchronization of reporting. The recommended minimum RTCP report interval per station is 5 seconds. Stations should not transmit RTCP reports more often than once every 5 seconds.

==Packet header==
* Version: (2 bits) Identifies the version of RTP, which is the same in RTCP packets as in RTP data packets. The version defined by this specification is two (2).
* P (Padding): (1 bits) Indicates if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet. Padding may be used to fill up a block of certain size, for example as required by an encryption algorithm. The last byte of the padding contains the number of padding bytes that were added (including itself).
* RC (Reception report count): (5 bits) The number of reception report blocks contained in this packet. A value of zero is valid.
* PT (Packet type): (8 bits) Contains a constant to identify RTCP packet type.
* Length: (16 bits) Indicates the length of this RTCP packet (including the header itself) in 32-bit units minus one.
* SSRC: (32 bits) &quot;Synchronization source identifier&quot; uniquely identifies the source of a stream.

Note that multiple reports can be concatenated into a single compound RTCP packet, each with its own packet header.

==Message types==
RTCP distinguishes several types of packets: &quot;sender report&quot;, &quot;receiver report&quot;, &quot;source description&quot;, and &quot;goodbye&quot;. In addition, the protocol is extensible and allows application-specific RTCP packets. A standards-based extension of RTCP is the &quot;extended report&quot; packet type introduced by RFC 3611.

;Sender report (SR):The sender report is sent periodically by the active senders in a conference to report transmission and reception statistics for all RTP packets sent during the interval. The sender report includes two distinct timestamps, an absolute timestamp, represented using the timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) (which is in seconds relative to midnight UTC on 1 January 1900) and an RTP timestamp that corresponds to the same time as the NTP timestamp, but in the same units and with the same random offset as the RTP timestamps in data packets described by this Sender Report. The absolute timestamp allows the receiver to synchronize RTP messages. It is particularly important when both audio and video are transmitted simultaneously because audio and video streams use independent relative timestamps.
;Receiver report (RR): The receiver report is for passive participants, those that do not send RTP packets. The report informs the sender and other receivers about the quality of service.
;Source description (SDES): The Source Description message is used to send the CNAME item to session participants. It may also be used to provide additional information such as the name, e-mail address, telephone number, and address of the owner or controller of the source.
;Goodbye (BYE): A source sends a BYE message to shut down a stream. It allows an endpoint to announce that it is leaving the conference. Although other sources can detect the absence of a source, this message is a direct announcement. It is also useful to a media mixer.
;Application-specific message (APP): The application-specific message provides a mechanism to design application-specific extensions to the RTCP protocol.

==Scalability in large deployments==
In large-scale applications, such as in Internet Protocol television (IPTV), very long delays (minutes to hours) between RTCP reports may occur, because of the RTCP bandwidth control mechanism required to control congestion (see Protocol functions). Acceptable frequencies are usually less than one per minute. This affords the potential of inappropriate reporting of the relevant statistics by the receiver or causes evaluation by the media sender to be inaccurate relative to the current state of the session. Methods have been introduced to alleviate the problems: RTCP filtering, RTCP biasing and hierarchical aggregation.

===Hierarchical aggregation===
The Hierarchical Aggregation (or also known as RTCP feedback hierarchy) is an optimization of the RTCP feedback model and its aim is to shift the maximum number of users limit further together with quality of service (QoS) measurement. The RTCP bandwidth is constant and takes just 5% of session bandwidth. Therefore, the reporting interval about QoS depends, among others, on a number of session members and for very large sessions it can become very high (minutes or even hours). However, the acceptable interval is about 10 seconds of reporting. Bigger values would cause time-shifted and very inaccurate reported status about the current session status and any optimization made by the sender could even have a negative effect on network or QoS conditions.

The Hierarchical Aggregation is used with Source-Specific Multicast where only a single source is allowed, i.e. IPTV. Another type of multicast could be Any-Source Multicast but it is not so suitable for large-scale applications with huge number of users.

, only the most modern IPTV systems use Hierarchical aggregation.

=== Feedback Target ===
Feedback Target is a new type of member that has been firstly introduced by the Internet Draft draft-ietf-avt-rtcpssm-13. The Hierarchical Aggregation method has extended its functionality. The function of this member is to receive Receiver Reports (RR) (see RTCP) and retransmit summarized RR packets, so-called Receiver Summary Information (RSI) to a sender (in case of single-level hierarchy).

<doc id="1003663" wikidata="Q473941" url="?curid=1003663" title="Amon G. Carter">
<text>Amon Giles Carter Sr. (born Giles Amon Carter; December 11, 1879 – June 23, 1955) was the creator and publisher of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, and a nationally known civic booster for Fort Worth, Texas. A legacy in his will was used to create Fort Worth&#x27;s Amon Carter Museum of American Art, which was founded by his daughter, Ruth Carter Stevenson, in January 1961.

==Biography==
Carter was born in Crafton, Texas. After his mother died in 1892, he moved away from his remaining family, to Bowie, Texas, where he supported himself with a variety of odd jobs. At those jobs, he learned salesmanship, and became a travelling salesman as a young man. Bowie residents have recalled that he was one of the original &quot;chicken &amp; bread boys&quot; who sold sandwiches represented as &quot;chicken&quot; to passengers at the rail station during the depression. The sandwiches, it was thought, were really made of rabbits that the boys had hunted. To this day Bowie has an annual Chicken &amp; Bread Festival each October.

===Publisher===
In May 1905, Carter accepted a job as an advertising space salesman in Fort Worth. A few months later, he agreed to help finance and run a new newspaper in town. The &quot;Fort Worth Star&quot; printed its first newspaper on February 1, 1906, with Carter as the advertising manager. The &quot;Star&quot; lost money, and was in danger of going bankrupt when Carter had an audacious idea: raise additional money and purchase his newspaper&#x27;s main competition, the &quot;Fort Worth Telegram&quot;. In November 1908, the &quot;Star&quot; purchased the &quot;Telegram&quot; for $100,000, and the two newspapers combined on January 1, 1909, into the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;.

From 1923 until after World War II, the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; had the largest circulation of any newspaper in the South, serving not just Fort Worth but also West Texas, New Mexico, and western Oklahoma. The newspaper created WBAP, the oldest radio station in Fort Worth, in 1922; and followed it with Texas&#x27; first television station, WBAP-TV, in 1948.

===Civic booster===
Carter parlayed this money and power into celebrity as a national spokesman for Fort Worth and West Texas (Carter popularized the description of Fort Worth as &quot;Where the West Begins&quot;, a phrase which still appears daily on the Star-Telegram&#x27;s front page, and Fort Worth Police Department vehicles). During the 1920s and 1930s, Carter personified the image of the Texas cowboy in the national mind: an uninhibited story-teller, gambler, and drinker, generous with his money and quick to draw his six-shooters. Major magazines such as &quot;Time&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; ran profiles of Carter, and he counted Will Rogers and Walter Winchell among his friends. The well-publicized hospitality of his Shady Oak Farm near Lake Worth was open to any major celebrity or businessman passing through Fort Worth. In 1961, &quot;National Geographic&quot; said that Carter had done &quot;more than any other one person to build the city into its present image&quot;.

Carter used his national stage to drum up business and government spending for his home region. From the Texas state legislature, he got a four-year college (now Texas Tech University) for Lubbock, where he was first chairman of the Board of Directors. He persuaded Southern Air Transport (now American Airlines) to move its headquarters from Dallas to nearby Fort Worth. Several oil companies moved or kept their headquarters in Fort Worth after personal interventions by Carter. In addition Carter was influential in obtaining for Fort Worth the construction of Air Force Plant 4 (now the headquarters of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics) and the relocation of Bell Aircraft (now Bell Helicopter Textron).

Carter&#x27;s disdain for Dallas, Fort Worth&#x27;s much larger and much richer neighbor, was legendary in Texas. One of the best-known stories about Carter is that he would take a sack lunch whenever he traveled to Dallas so he wouldn&#x27;t have to spend any money there. He was also quoted as saying &quot;Fort Worth is where the West begins...and Dallas is where the East peters out.&quot; On his orders, the &quot;Star-Telegram&quot; television station, WBAP-TV, avoided mentions of Dallas or of even being part of a merged Dallas–Fort Worth television market on his orders even when it was clear the two cities would be a single market. Carter&#x27;s heirs maintained this line until NBC pressured them to relent several years after Carter&#x27;s death, along with a move of its transmitter to Cedar Hill to cover both cities equally.

After World War II, Carter stopped barnstorming on behalf of Fort Worth. In January 1951, Carter received a donation from the Texas and Pacific Railway—steam locomotive No. 610—and he put it on static display near the Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum on behalf of the Southwestern Exposition and Fat Stock Show. In 1953, he suffered the first of several heart attacks; the final one, two years later, was fatal. On June 23, 1955, Carter died in Fort Worth, Texas. He was buried in Greenwood Memorial Cemetery in Fort Worth.

==Legacy==

* Texas Christian University in Fort Worth named its football stadium Amon G. Carter Stadium to recognize Carter&#x27;s contributions to the college.
* The main entrance of the Texas Tech University campus in Lubbock, Texas, is named Amon G. Carter Plaza. The plaza includes a sculpture of the university&#x27;s seal, set against a backdrop of a seven-jet fountain and an equestrian statue, entitled &quot;Riding into the Sunset&quot;.
* Fort Worth&#x27;s former commercial airport (whose remains may be seen just north of 183 before you enter Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and the current location of the American Airlines corporate headquarters), bore his name as Amon G. Carter Airfield. The airport was later changed to Greater Southwest International Airport before operations moved to DFW in 1974.
* Following the airport&#x27;s demolition, in 1979, its main runway was converted to a city street and named Amon Carter Boulevard. By coincidence, KXAS-TV and Telemundo station KXTX-TV moved to new studio facilities along that street in 2013, and a conference room in the facility was named for Carter.
* Carter BloodCare, one of the largest blood banks in the country, is named after Carter after he provided grant money to help charter the nonprofit in 1959.
* Carter Peak in Big Bend National Park is named in honor of Carter&#x27;s contributions to the establishment of the park.
* The main auditorium at Texas A&amp;M School of Law is named after Amon Carter. It was a gift of the Amon G. Carter Foundation.
* The Southern Air Transport terminal at Fort Worth Meacham International Airport, now Atlantic Aviation, was dedicated to Amon Carter in 1933.
* The Fort Worth ISD&#x27;s Amon Carter Riverside High School honors Carter.
* YMCA Camp Carter (YMCA of Metropolitan Fort Worth) located in Fort Worth.
* Amon G. Carter Lake in Bowie, Texas is also named after Mr. Carter.
* Locomotive No. 610 was later removed from display at the Will Rogers Coliseum and restored for use in pulling the American Freedom Train with financial assistance from Carter&#x27;s son, Amon G. Carter, Jr.. Since 1986, No. 610 has remained on display at the Texas State Railroad in Palestine.

<doc id="1003665" wikidata="Q3181538" url="?curid=1003665" title="Rocky (comic strip)">
<text>Rocky is a Swedish autobiographical comic strip created by Martin Kellerman, focusing on an anthropomorphic dog, Rocky, and his friends in their everyday life in Stockholm.

== Overview ==
&quot;Rocky&quot; is based on Kellerman&#x27;s own life. According to Kellerman, &quot;My friends are just such perfect cartoon characters. A lot of times they say things and all I have to do is write it down. Their personalities match and complement each other so well, it&#x27;s impossible not to write it down. If I wait a while, even the upsetting stuff they can still laugh about.&quot;

Some of the humor draws from hip hop culture, and the dialogue sometimes incorporates English phrases. Kellerman states that &quot;when a Swede says something like Jay-Z would say, that&#x27;s automatically funny. It&#x27;s still white here, but in Sweden, it&#x27;s funnier. Most of my friends have grown up on hip-hop, but it&#x27;s like a joke—we&#x27;re so not gangsta.&quot;

The comic has been translated to Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Serbian, English, Spanish, and French, either as a running strip or collected in book form.

== History ==
Kellerman created &quot;Rocky&quot; after his girlfriend broke up with him and he was fired from his job as a cartoonist for a pornographic magazine. He decided to draw a comic strip about his current situation to entertain himself and his friends and did not initially take it seriously. The strip was picked up by the free newspaper &quot;Metro&quot; and moved from publication to publication because multiple newspapers canceled the strip in response to reader complaints over its profanity and sexual content.

The strips have been collected in several books, first one published in 1999. Fantagraphics Books published two volumes of the strip, translated into English, in 2005 and 2008. Kellerman also publishes &quot;Rocky&quot; as a magazine, featuring comic strips and other material, including interviews with hip hop artists such as 50 Cent, M.I.A. and The Game drawn in comic form. &quot;Rocky&quot; has also been performed as a touring play in Sweden in 2000. 13 episodes of an animated TV series were produced, and have been released on DVD.

His co-host was a young Latina woman named Elizabeth who had performed in a number of his films under the pseudonym Bonita. Guests included Bridget Powers. The radio show was rated number one in its time slot.

<doc id="1003673" wikidata="Q6028719" url="?curid=1003673" title="Inez Tenenbaum">
<text>Inez Tenenbaum (née Moore; born March 8, 1951) is an American lawyer and politician who served as South Carolina Superintendent of Education and as chairperson of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. In 2016, she joined a law firm. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Education==
Tenenbaum was born in Hawkinsville, Georgia, obtained a Bachelor of Science in 1972 from the University of Georgia, and a Master&#x27;s in Education two years later from the same university. She received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of South Carolina, Columbia in 1986, where she was an associate editor-in-chief of the &quot;South Carolina Law Review&quot;.

==Career==
Originally a public school teacher, Tenenbaum entered state government as an employee of the South Carolina Department of Social Services. She later served as the director of research for the Medical, Military, Public and Municipal Affairs Committee of the South Carolina House of Representatives. She practiced with a private law firm, Sinkler &amp; Boyd, P.A. from 1986 to 1992, in the areas of health, environment, and public interest law.

===State Superintendent of Education===
Tenenbaum was elected State Superintendent of Education in November 1998 and re-elected in November 2002. She focused her administration on six key initiatives to fuel education progress in South Carolina: raising the academic bar and embracing accountability for student academic progress, improving teacher quality, providing quality early childhood education for all children, supporting strong and effective school leadership, promoting safe and healthy schools, and increasing parent and community involvement.

During her tenure, the South Carolina General Assembly approved a $750 million school bond legislation for K-12 school construction and renovation, with local districts leveraging the bond amount to raise the total to $1.75 billion. More than 140 new schools were built under the act, using a combination of state and local voter-approved bonds.

In 2005, following parental complaints, Tenenbaum removed Chris Crutcher&#x27;s book, &quot;Whale Talk&quot;, from the state&#x27;s English reading list for middle grades. She was featured in an interview by John Stossel for a &quot;20/20&quot; Special Edition about public schools in the United States and world. Tenenbaum defended South Carolina&#x27;s progress, noting that the state was rapidly narrowing the gap between its students&#x27; test scores and the national average.

By the end of her term in 2007, South Carolina was a key leader in the nation in education improvement. Five independent national studies—by the Fordham Foundation, Princeton Review, the Large-Scale Assessment Study, the Northwest Evaluation Association, Quality Counts, and Education Next,—indicated that South Carolina&#x27;s standards for student academic proficiency under No Child Left Behind were among the most rigorous in the nation.

During her tenure, South Carolina&#x27;s performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) showed top rankings for improvement:
* Math, Grade 4—Number 1 in the nation
* Math, Grade 8—Number 1 in the nation
* Science, Grade 4—Number 1 in the nation
* Science, Grade 8—Number 3 in the nation

Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s identified South Carolina as an &quot;outperformer&quot; on NAEP for consistently achieving above the statistical expectations. The state&#x27;s SAT scores increased 34 points over eight years (1999-2007), the largest ten-year gain in the nation. The 2007 national report card &quot;Quality Counts,&quot; published by &quot;Education Week&quot;, ranked the state first in the nation in academic standards, assessment, and accountability. It ranked 11th in efforts to connect K-12 education with early learning, higher education, and the world of work. &quot;Quality Counts&quot; ranked the state first for improving teacher quality in 2003 and 2004, and number two for teacher quality improvements in 2005 and 2006.

Tenenbaum was succeeded as Superintendent of Education by Democrat Jim Rex on January 10, 2007.

===Consumer Products Safety Commission===
On May 5, 2009, President Barack Obama announced that he would nominate Tenenbaum to head the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. She was confirmed in that position by the U.S. Senate unanimously on June 19, 2009. On February 28, 2013 Tenenbaum announced that she will not seek renomination when her term expires in October 2013.

In 2009, the CPSC established its first overseas office in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. In the same year, it created an Internet Surveillance Unit to aid in marketplace surveillance of retail and Internet auction sites to identify sellers offering banned, recalled, or dangerous products.

In October 2010, Tenenbaum announced a five-year strategic plan (2011–2016), which established a new mission and vision for the Commission. Also in 2010, under her leadership, the CPSC made the Office of Education, Global Outreach, and Small Business Ombudsman to facilitate outreach to domestic and international stakeholders, including manufacturers, retailers, resellers, small businesses, and foreign governments.

In 2011, the CPSC opened the new National Product Testing and Evaluation Center (NPTEC), testing products for defects and developing methods to determine compliance with safety standards. In October 2011, the CPSC led the first North American Consumer Product Safety Summit with Canada and Mexico. In March 2011, it launched the publicly available Consumer Product Safety Information Database, SaferProducts.gov. In 2011, it implemented a Risk Assessment Methodology (RAM) pilot project that to analyze data available in Custom and Border Protection&#x27;s International Trade Data System (ITDS) to target potentially violative products coming into the United States.

The CPSC obtained more than 1,800 recalls between 2009 and 2012. In 2012, the CPSC conducted 439 recalls involving more than 91 million units from around the world. In the same year, it screened over 17,000 models of imported consumer products at U.S. ports. In 2012, it began its International Extended Training Exchange Program.

In 2012, in collaboration with consumer product regulators in Australia, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand, CPSC, along with KidSafe, organized a multijurisdictional symposium on technical solutions to eliminate or mitigate the hazards posed by ingested button batteries.
In 2012, the CPSC began a public-private collaboration to work on lowering the risk of concussions and other mild traumatic brain injuries at the youth football level. The &quot;Youth Football Brain Safety&quot; initiative involved major companies that manufacture or recondition football helmets, industry associations, the National Football League (NFL) and its Players Association, USA Football, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Through private funding, the program provides assistance to football programs for economically disadvantaged youth, outfitting their players in newer and properly maintained helmets.

As of September 30, 2012, the CPSC completed 96 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA)-related rulemaking activities since the passage of the CPSIA in 2008, including 40 final rules and 20 accreditation requirements.

The CPSC launched a campaign in 2013 to reduce drowning risks for children. The CPSC began an investigation into the safety concerns of liquid laundry packets that have been swallowed by children in April 2013. In November 2013, the CPSC worked with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seize more than 200,000 toy dolls that were made in China and contained banned chemical compounds.

During her tenure at the CPSC, Tenenbaum made regulations for children&#x27;s products, created a public database to catalog product safety complaints, and put in place mandatory standards for children&#x27;s beds, cribs, and swings. In 2013, she stepped down from her role with the CPSC to take a job with the law firm Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough LLP.

==2004 U.S. Senate run==

Tenenbaum was the Democratic candidate in the 2004 election for retiring Democrat Fritz Hollings&#x27;s seat in the U.S. Senate; she lost to Republican nominee Jim DeMint by 152,783 votes.

==Law firm==
In 2016, she announced she would join the law firm of Wyche, P.A. Her practice focuses on consumer product safety and risk management, working particularly with manufacturers and retailers of consumer products to ensure compliance with applicable consumer product safety requirements and to protect the client&#x27;s brand.

===Awards===
In 2001, The Center for Creative Leadership, a nonprofit education institution in Greensboro, North Carolina, named Inez Tenenbaum the recipient of its third annual Distinguished Alumni Award for &quot;making leadership a fundamental requirement for school reform as part of South Carolina&#x27;s strategic plan for education.&quot;

In 2009, Washingtonian Magazine listed Inez Tenenbaum as one of the 100 Most Powerful Women in Washington, DC.

== Personal ==
Tenenbaum and her husband Samuel Tenebaum reside in Lexington, South Carolina. She is Methodist, and her husband is Jewish.

<text>This is a list of leaning towers. A leaning tower is a tower which, either intentionally or unintentionally (due to errors in design, construction, or subsequent external influence such as unstable ground), does not stand perpendicular to the ground. The most famous example is the Leaning Tower in Pisa, Italy.

According to economics reporter, Eric Lach, as he was reporting on the 1 Seaport building in 2025, &quot;leaning towers are one of those problems . . . that modern societies think they&#x27;ve solved, or surpassed, despite all the evidence to the contrary&quot;.

<text>Ira Ruskin (November 12, 1943 – July 3, 2014) was an American politician from Redwood City, California. A Democrat, he is a former member of the California State Assembly and of Redwood City Council. He and his wife Cheryl (a licensed landscape designer) resided in Redwood City, California; the couple had no children.

==Education==
He received a B.A. in history from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968 and an M.A. in communications (with an emphasis on filmmaking) from Stanford University in 1983. 

==Political career==
From 1995 to 2004, Ruskin was a member of the Redwood City Council. From 1999 to 2001, he also served as Mayor of Redwood City. In 2004, Ruskin was elected to the California Assembly. He defeated Republican Steve Poizner in the general election. Ruskin had local government experience but initially lacked major campaign funding. The Assembly race heated up when Poizner donated $6 million to his own campaign. Ruskin began fundraising from California&#x27;s public employee unions and ultimately won the race.

In November 2006 Ruskin was re-elected to the California State Assembly by a wide margin, 67.4% to his challenger Virginia Chang Kiraly&#x27;s 32.6%. He was re-elected to his third Assembly term in 2008. Term limits in California prevented Ruskin from running for re-election in 2010. Ruskin planned to run for a State Senate seat in 2012.

==Awards==
Ruskin was the recipient of the first-ever award from DAWN (a Democratic feminist organization) to a man for &quot;excellent work performed on behalf of freedom and equality for women.&quot; He helped bring attention to the plight of the Bosnian Muslim women in a public forum which included the live transatlantic interview of rape camp survivors. Ruskin became involved in public policy and politics after working on rape as a genocidal weapon in Bosnia.

==Death==
In May 2011 Ruskin told friends he had been diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor and was withdrawing from the political arena to concentrate on his health. On July 3, 2014, he died at age 70.

<doc id="1003699" wikidata="Q621696" url="?curid=1003699" title="Economic appraisal">
<text>Economic appraisal is a type of decision method applied to a project, programme or policy that takes into account a wide range of costs and benefits, denominated in monetary terms or for which a monetary equivalent can be estimated. Economic appraisal is a key tool for achieving value for money and satisfying requirements for decision accountability. It is a systematic process for examining alternative uses of resources, focusing on assessment of needs, objectives, options, costs, benefits, risks, funding, affordability and other factors relevant to decisions.

The main types of economic appraisal are:
* Cost–benefit analysis
* Cost-effectiveness analysis
* Scoring and weighting

Economic appraisal is a methodology designed to assist in defining problems and finding solutions that offer the best value for money (VFM). This is especially important in relation to public expenditure and is often used as a vehicle for planning and approval of public investment relating to policies, programmes and projects.

The principles of appraisal are applicable to all decisions, even those concerned with small expenditures. However, the scope of appraisal can also be very wide. Good economic appraisal leads to better decisions and VFM. It facilitates good project management and project evaluation. Appraisal is an essential part of good financial management, and it is vital to decision-making and accountability.

<doc id="1003714" wikidata="Q5341179" url="?curid=1003714" title="Education in Vietnam">
<text>Education in Vietnam is a state-run system of public and private education run by the Ministry of Education and Training. It is divided into five levels: preschool, primary school, secondary school, high school, and higher education. Formal education consists of twelve years of basic education. Basic education consists of five years of primary education, four years of secondary education, and three years of high school education. The majority of basic education students are enrolled on a daily basis. The main goals are general knowledge improvement, human resources training and talent development.

Vietnam has undergone major political upheaval and social inequality throughout its recent history and is attempting to modernise. Historically, education in Vietnam followed the Chinese Confucian model, using Chữ Hán (for the Vietnamese language and for Chinese) as the main mode of literature and governance. This system promoted those who were talented enough to be mandarins or royal courtiers in Vietnam and China. This system was then completely overhauled and replaced by a French model system during French colonial times, which has since been replaced and overhauled again during the formation of independent Vietnam and the creation of Chữ Quốc Ngữ alphabet in the 1920s.

Vietnam is known for its curriculum that is deemed highly competitive. High school education is one of the most significant social issues in the country: designated schools known as &quot;High Schools for the Gifted&quot; (&quot;Trường Trung học phổ thông chuyên&quot;) offer additional extensive courses, are generally regarded as prestigious, and demand high entrance examination test scores. Higher education is seen as fundamental in Vietnam. Entrance to university is determined through the National High School Examination (THPTQG) test. The higher the entrance test score, the more highly regarded the institution will be.

Currently experiencing a high GDP growth rate, Vietnam is attempting to expand its education system. In 2012, estimated national budget for education was 6.3%. In the last decade, Vietnamese public reception of the country&#x27;s education system has been mixed due to its inflexible nature and its tests. Citizens have been critical of the curriculum, which has led to social issues including depression, anxiety, and increasing suicide rates. There have been comments from the public that schools should opt for a more flexible studying program, with less emphasis on tests and more focus on developing life skills. In response to public opinion, the Ministry of Education and Training has implemented a number of education reforms. Tertiary enrollment rates were only 3% in 1995 but increased to around 30% by 2019. Regardless, more work is needed to be done to improve education at all levels, from pre-primary, to primary, to secondary, to post-secondary.

==Establishments==
Regarding ownership, as prescribed in Article 44 of Vietnam&#x27;s Education Law, there are four types of educational establishments:
* Public education establishments: established and monitored by the State. The State also nominates their administrators and decides staff quota. The State invests in infrastructure and allocates funding for their regular spending tasks.
* Semi-public educational establishments: set up by the State on the basis of mobilizing organizations and individuals in the society to jointly invest in infrastructure.
* People-founded educational establishments: Social or economic organizations apply for permission from the State to set up an institution with non-State budget capital.
* Private educational establishments: Individuals or groups of individuals apply for permission from the State to set up and invest in the institution by themselves.
The semi-public, people-founded and private educational establishments are referred collectively to as non-public educational establishments.

==School grades==
In Vietnam, a school year is divided into two semesters: the first begins in mid or late in August (although the admission day or opening ceremony is 5 September) and lasts until the end of December, while the second begins right after the first, which is about mid-January and ends in May.

== Academic grading ==
==Preschool==
Public kindergartens usually admit children ranging from 18 months to 5 years of age. Sometimes, four- or five-year-old children are taught the alphabet and basic arithmetic. This level of education is not compulsory but tends to be popular in cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Hai Phong, Can Tho and Vung Tau.

==Primary==

Children normally start primary education (tiểu học) at the age of six. Education at this level lasts for 5 years and is compulsory for all children. The country&#x27;s literacy rate is over 90%.

According to the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey 2006 of Vietnam&#x27;s General Statistics Office, 96% of six to 11-year-old children enrolled in primary school. There was still a disparity in the primary education completion rate among different ethnicity groups. While primary completion rate for Kinh students was 86%, the rate for ethnic minority children was only 61%.

In the school year 2009–2010, Vietnam had 15,172 primary schools and 611 combined primary and lower secondary schools. The total enrollment was 7.02 million pupils, of whom 46% were girls.

The renovated primary education curriculum in Vietnam is divided into two phases as follows:

* Phase 1 includes Grades 1, 2 and 3 with 9 subjects: Vietnamese Language, Mathematics, Morality, Nature and Society, Arts, Physical Education, and (since 2020) Experience Activities, Information Technology and Foreign Language.
* Phase 2 includes Grades 4 and 5 with 12 subjects: Vietnamese Language, Information Technology, Mathematics, Morality, Science (Nature and Society), History, Geography, Basic Techniques, Music, Arts, Physical Education and (since 2023) Experience Activities and Foreign Language.

== Secondary ==
Secondary education () consists of lower secondary education or junior high school () followed by high school or upper secondary high school ().

===Lower===

Lower secondary school () or Junior high school includes sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth grade. Until its abolition in 2006, students had to pass the Intermediate Graduation Examination (IGE) presented by the local Department of Education and Training to graduate. The IGE comprises Math, Literature, and Foreign Language tests. This educational level is homogeneous throughout most of the country, except in very remote provinces, which expect to popularize and standardize middle education within the next few years. Intermediate education is not compulsory in Vietnam.

The Lower Secondary Education&#x27;s weekly schedule includes the following subjects and activities: Vietnamese Language (Literature), Mathematics, Natural Science (Biology, Physics, Chemistry), History and Geography, Civics, Foreign Language, Physical Education, Technology, Art, Music, Optional Subjects, Class Activities and School Activities, Vocational-oriented activities (3 periods per month in Grade 8 or in some cases, the summer between 7th and 8th Grade) and Extra-curricular activities (4 periods per month in all grades). Ιn the end of year 8, student will participate in secondary vocational exam to earn extra-mark for the 10th grade examination.

The Technology subject aims to show the link between theory and practice. It includes four parts: home economics (in Grade 6), agriculture-forestry and aquaculture (in Grade 7), Industry (in Grade 8) and optional modules (in Grade 9).
====Middle school ====
All subjects are compulsory for students.
*Literature: mostly Vietnamese literature, occasionally combined with foreign literature including Chinese, French, American and Russian
*Mathematics
** Years 6: two separate subjects – Arithmetic and Geometry
** Years 7–10: two separate subjects – Algebra and Geometry
** Year 11: three separate subjects – Algebra, Calculus and Geometry
** Year 12: two separate subjects – Calculus, and Geometry
*Natural Science (Year 6–9, from 2021)
**Physics (from year 10 onward since 2024)
**Chemistry (from year 8 onward until 2023; year 10 onward starting 2024)
**Biology (from year 10 onward since 2024)
*History and Geography (Year 6–9, from 2021)
**History (from year 10 onward starting 2024)
**Geography (from year 10 onward starting 2024)
*Civics: generally consists of economics, philosophy (Marxism-Leninism), politics, jurisprudence and ethics
*Foreign language: English is the predominant foreign language with the option to add a second foreign language (usually French); Mandarin, Russian, Japanese, German and Korean are taught at some specialized schools
*Technology (Vocational Training): consists of Agriculture/Horticulture, Mechanics, Electronics, Design, etc.
*Informatics: recently introduced, yet to be implemented in poorer regions. Students study basic programming in languages such as Pascal, C/C++ and Python (from 2020)
*Physical Education (P.E)
*National Defense and Security Training (since year 10)
*Music and Arts (until the first half of year 9 until 2022, after which Music and Arts has been introduced from year 10 onward since)

Advanced classes consists of either:
*Natural sciences: Students follow an advanced curriculum (and different textbooks) in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology
*Social sciences: Students follow an advanced curriculum (and different textbooks) in literature, history, geography and foreign language

At the start of secondary school, students can enroll in Specialist Classes if they pass the class entrance exam, which usually consists of a Mathematics exam, a Literature exam, a Foreign Language exam and an exam of the subject that the student wants to specialize in. The specialised subject can be any of the subjects listed above, except Technology, Physical Education, Civics and Music/Arts. If the specialised subjects Students enrolled in these programs have a heavier workload than regular secondary school students. The workload varies from school to school, but grade 11 students are generally expected to study grade 12 courses concurrently. Other courses include university-level courses. Some schools go as far as requiring their students to finish secondary school by the end of grade 10.

Only prestigious schools offer these unstandardized classes.

===High school===
High school or upper secondary school education () consists of grades ten to twelve. There is often an entrance examination for high schooling. The score determines the schools at which students are able to enroll. The higher the score, the more prestigious the school.

==== Graduation exam====
All high school students in Vietnam are required to take a high school graduation exam (&quot;Kỳ thi Tốt nghiệp Trung học phổ thông&quot;), which is administered by the Ministry of Education and Training, at the end of grade 12 to get a diploma called the Graduation Diploma of General Upper Secondary Education (&quot;Bằng tốt nghiệp Trung học phổ thông&quot;). They still have to take the regular end-of-term examinations before taking the National High School Exam.

The Ministry of Education and Training announced that for the graduation examination of 2017, five papers would be included: Mathematics, Literature, Foreign language, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences. Three papers are mandatory for all students: Mathematics, Literature (the only remaining essay-based exam paper which is the spiritual successor of 1075-1919 exams), and Foreign language. Foreign language exam can be one of the following: English, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian or Korean (since 2021). Apart from three mandatory papers, student must complete a fourth paper by choosing either natural sciences (a combination of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) or Social Sciences (a combination of History, Geography, and Civic Education). In some cases, before 2020, students can take both the Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and will choose the paper with the higher result to be evaluated.

==University==
From 2002 to 2014, university entrance is based on the scores achieved in the Universities and Colleges Selection Examination (TSĐHCĐ). Since 2015, the Universities and Colleges Selection Examination have been abolished (along with the High School Graduation Examination), to be replaced by a unified test, which is the National High School Examination (THPTQG). The THPTQG was stopped after 2019, then High School Graduation Examination (TNTHPT) was held again, with the results able to be used by universities for admission or consider admission based on the results of new self-organized admission tests, such as Aptitude Test (VNU, VNU-HCM, HNUE, HCMUE, and Vietnamese police academies), or Thinking Skills Assessment (HUST).

High school graduates need high scores to be admitted to universities. Securing a place in a public university is considered a major step in a successful career, especially for rural or otherwise disadvantaged people. The pressure on the candidates therefore remains very high, despite the measures taken to reduce the importance of these exams. The demand for student placements into universities outweighed the supply, where around 1.3 million students would choose to enroll into universities, but only 600,000 could be supplied due to lack of teaching staff at the tertiary level or post-secondary level. This prompted major calls for the government to help expand the tertiary sector, especially with increasing trend of enrolments into university from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, university admissions is highly competitive.

Normally, candidates take three exams for the fixed group of subjects they choose. There are many fixed groups of subjects, the main ones being:

*Group A: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry
*Group A1: Mathematics, Physics, English
*Group B: Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry
*Group C: Literature, History, Geography
*Group D: Literature, Foreign Language, Mathematics

Group D consists of six subgroups based on the languages they provide in universities:
*Group D1: entrance exam subject is English; major language in university is English
*Group D2: entrance exam subject is Russian; major language in university is Russian
*Group D3: entrance exam subject is French; major language in university is French
*Group D4: entrance exam subject is Chinese; major language in university is Mandarin
*Group D5: entrance exam subject is German; major language in university is German
*Group D6: entrance exam subject is Japanese; major language in university is Japanese

Besides these, there are groups for artistic and cultural education:
*Group H: Literature, Visual Art Talents
*Group M: Literature, Mathematics, Singing and Expressive Reading, Instrument Performance (&quot;optional&quot;)
*Group N: Literature, Tone and Melody, Vocal
*Group R: Literature, History, Journalism
*Group S: Literature, Theatrical Talents
*Group T: Mathematics, Biology, Sports
*Group V: Mathematics, Physics, Drawing

In 2007, Vietnam&#x27;s Ministry of Education and Training started to use multiple choice exam format for several subjects during the university entrance examination. These subjects include Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Foreign Language. Each multiple choice exam lasts 90 minutes. The foreign language exam consists of 80 multiple choice questions; meanwhile, the Physics, Chemistry, Biology exam has 50 questions. Math, Literature, History and Geography exams use composition format.

Starting from the entrance exam of 2013, 10 artistic and cultural universities will remove Literature from the exam of the group H, N and S. Instead, the results of three years in high school and the scores of the HGE will be used to evaluate the candidates.

Starting from 2015, high school graduation and university entrance merged to one exam. Each student will take at least four subjects for the exam including three compulsory — mathematics, literature and foreign language (mostly English) — and one sub-subject such as physics, chemistry, geography, biology, history. After the result has been given, the student can use their score to pass the high school graduation exam and to go to their desired college with three chosen points from the four given.

===Types===
Vietnamese Government decree (decree 43/2000/ND-CP, dated August 30, 2000) identified three types of higher education institutions:
* University system (&quot;đại học&quot;), which is a multidisciplinary institution offering fields of study and which has research capacities. Six major university systems in Vietnam are Vietnam National University, Hanoi; Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City; Hue University; University of Da Nang; Thai Nguyen University; and Hanoi University of Science and Technology. 
* University (or college; &quot;trường đại học&quot;), which is more narrowly focused in its curriculum, sometimes on a single study area.
* Academy (&quot;học viện&quot;), which is also narrowly focused in terms of study area but which may have a specialized research capacity.

The current Vietnamese government also maintains a national key university policy. This is a list of universities with high achievements and training quality, classified according to the scientific fields that the university offers. These universities will receive more benefits in operation and management, for example: priority to receive support packages to build training programs and facilities, approve projects to open new majors and education programs, being able to educate and self-award a doctoral degree without first approval from the Ministry of Education and Training.

Other post-secondary forms of education also include junior college or community colleges, professional secondary schools, and vocational schools which offer degrees or certificates. Several universities offer college vocational degrees as well as shorter general and specific industry-tailored training courses.

In the school year 2010–2011, Vietnam had 163 universities (including senior colleges and institutes) and 223 junior colleges, in which 50 senior colleges and 30 junior colleges are non-public.

The presence of international universities are increasing. Universities such as PSB International College, RMIT, Eastern International University and University of Hawaii offer degrees in fields such as business, English as a Second Language and Information Technology. Running an international education system in Vietnam is challenging. Quality control and affordability are key issues, as well as red tape. Additionally, in the past, Viet Nam had followed a Soviet Union model where research and teaching institutes were separated instead of being together.

===Qualifications===
* Associate Degree (): a three-year program delivered by junior colleges (including teachers colleges and others) and/or by some universities as additional training programs.
* Bachelor&#x27;s degree (): a four- to six-year program — six years for students studying medical and dental sciences; five years for students of industrial engineering; and four years for the majority of other undergraduate degrees such as Social Sciences. Graduates receive degrees with a title corresponding to their field of study such as bachelor (cử nhân), engineer (kỹ sư), medical doctor (bác sĩ), or lawyer (luật sư), etc.

Most of Vietnam&#x27;s universities also offer master&#x27;s (two years) and Doctor of Philosophy (four years) degrees.

==Teaching quality issues==
The higher education system has been criticised by Vietnam&#x27;s diaspora, such as outdated curricula, a lecturer-centered method of teaching and learning, a lack of linkage between teaching and research activities, and a large discord between theory and practical training that leads to a large number of graduates being unable to find a job, while skills shortages drive inflation to double-digit levels. Vietnamese students perceive themselves to have a lack of knowledge despite being taught a lot due to the fact that the main purpose of studying was to pass exams or to achieve high test scores without real-life implementation. According to the survey on graduate employment in 2009-2010 conducted by Center for Policy Studies and Analysis- University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, among 3000 respondents, 26.2% were unemployed. Among those employed, 61% lacked sufficient working skill, 43% lacked experience, and 32% felt insecure in providing professional expertise.

Teaching methods delivered in the public system are mainly teacher-oriented. Class discussions are uncommon as students are expected to be studious and passively attentive in the classroom. This method may be a manifestation of Confucian culture and is in contrast to British and American pedagogy, where interaction and debate is prominent.

Advanced and specialized high school students are generally expected to study additional courses, which can amount to a total of nine periods a day. Parents also enroll their children into extensive tutoring sessions, which is not to be confused with cram schools, because the tutoring sessions are taken regardless of any upcoming tests or exams. The average monthly salary of local Vietnamese public teachers is between US$60 and US$100, so many supplement their income by moonlighting, working in the private sector or tutoring. Students who do not attend these sessions are always at a disadvantage, as materials appearing on tests and exams are often covered only in tutoring sessions.

Public schools are underfunded. Only primary schools are subsidized by the government, to 50% of the total tuition cost. Enrollment rates are high and primary education quality, particularly in poor areas, is below the required standard. Moreover, the drop-out rate after fifth grade is also high for those in rural and mountainous area since most students cannot afford to attend secondary school or university due to poverty. Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) found that for many poor households, child labor is considered more valuable than school attendance in short-term economics. Regular school absenteeism also leads to poor academic performance. For poor families, the opportunity cost of sending their children to school is perceived to be high and the long-term benefit of education cannot outweigh the short-term economic losses. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of Education and Training has implemented a number of educational reforms from 2015 onward.

== English as a second language ==
Private language centers offering English as a second language are in high demand in the larger cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Examinations such as IELTS (International English Language Testing System) or TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), but especially IELTS, have become more popular means of verified International English examinations for universities and other ventures in Viet Nam.

Stringent immigration/visa system is now being more strictly enforced (where previously the regulations were only enforced if visiting teachers fell foul of the criminal legal system). Now schools are routinely inspected for foreign teachers (ostensibly to ensure the tax codes are applied) and, as part of this process, degrees and teaching qualifications must be verified by the holder&#x27;s embassy or relevant authority. Copies must be filed with immigration authorities. Similar regulations for opening bank accounts and registration of residences of foreigners mean unqualified teachers remain but are often consigned to the &quot;back-street&quot; schools or may be susceptible to disreputable school owners and landlords. The penalties for abuse of these regulations are substantial with respect to rents or incomes of schools.

The country has implemented OECD guidelines to the education sector with respect to English language skills of high school and university graduates. This means that for high school graduates to apply for university entry, overseas study (high school or university), or graduate from an undergraduate university course, individuals must achieve an internationally recognised and standardised test of English (IELTS, TOEIC, TOEFL, etc., or sometimes worryingly &quot;an equivalent, designed, created and marked by local instructors, with scores/levels varying from course/degree/university/institution). This recent development has caused further changes in this sector, attracting further experienced IELTS trainers, retaining existing trainers and creating demands for teacher training from such agencies as British Council and IDP.&quot;

=== National Foreign Languages 2020 Project ===
In 2008, the Vietnamese government officially approved the &quot;Foreign Language Teaching and Learning in the National Education System in the 2008-2020 Period&quot; plan through Decision No. 1400/QD-TTg. Among other things, it set the ambitious goal of seeing 100 percent of students enrolled in a 10-year foreign language education program by 2020. By 2017, however, the goal was well out of reach so the program was extended to 2025 through Decision 2080/QD-TTg.

<text>Antônio Diogo da Silva Parreiras (20 January 1860, Niterói, Brazil – 17 October 1937, Niterói, Brazil) was a Brazilian painter, designer and illustrator.

==Biography==

He was one of nine children and his father was a goldsmith. In 1882, he enrolled at the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, but left two years later to attend the free painting classes being offered by the German immigrant artist Georg Grimm. In 1885, when Grimm left to work in the countryside, Parreiras became an autodidact. A year later, one of his works was purchased by Emperor Pedro II.

This allowed him to resume his formal studies and travel to Europe in 1888, entering the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia where his teacher was Filippo Carcano. Upon his return to Brazil two years later, he participated in the &quot;&quot;. Later that same year, he became a Professor of landscape painting at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (ENBA) and, following the example set by Grimm, introduced his students to plein-air painting. Following disagreements with ENBA over changes in the curriculum, he set up his own school called the &quot; Escola do Ar Livre&quot;.

He was soon doing much of his work in the forests outside Teresópolis. He also received numerous commissions to paint historical scenes and, after 1899, did decorations for the government in public buildings, such as the &quot;Allegory of Apollo and the Goddesses of the Hours&quot;, which he created for the Palácio da Liberdade in Belo Horizonte. His female nudes are also considered to be especially well done. From 1906 to 1919, he maintained a second studio in Paris and exhibited at the Salon. He was also named a delegate of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1911.

In 1925 he was chosen as Brazil&#x27;s best artist by the readers of &quot;, a magazine created by art critic Gonzaga Duque. The following year, he published his autobiography and was inducted into the &quot;. In 1933, he participated in his last exhibitions; the &quot;Jubileu Artístico&quot; in São Paulo and Niteroi. Four years after his death, his former studio became the .

<doc id="1003721" wikidata="Q1541280" url="?curid=1003721" title="Siebel Si 204">
<text>The Siebel Si 204 is a small twin-engined transport and trainer aircraft developed in World War II. It was based on the Siebel Fh 104 Hallore. Originally designed in response to a German Ministry of Aviation development order for a small civil transport aircraft in 1938, it was eventually produced for the Luftwaffe.

==Development and production==
The Si 204 was planned as a small all-metal passenger aircraft with two crew and eight passengers for German airline Deutsche Luft Hansa (DLH). Development was initiated in 1938. The contractor was, as usual, the RLM, but the development was conducted in close collaboration between DLH and Siebel in Halle.

After the beginning of the war, the aircraft was redesigned as a trainer aircraft with a full &quot;stepless&quot; glass cockpit, as had been initiated with the He 111P in early 1938, with no separate flat windscreen for the pilot (much as almost all German bomber aircraft of the time were being designed), which seemed to be better for instrument flying in the Si 204&#x27;s case.

The first two prototypes only were delivered as passenger aircraft with the old cockpit. The maiden flight of the first prototype was before September 1940, possibly on 25 May 1940, that of the second prototype before February 1941. The third prototype was redesigned as a trainer aircraft for instrument flying. As a result of this, the maiden flight was not earlier than the end of 1941 or the beginning of 1942.

At that time, Siebel produced the Junkers Ju 88 under licence, so only 15 prototypes were able to be built in Halle. As a result, &quot;Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Nord &quot; (SNCAN) in France produced the A-0 preseries and A-1 production passenger aircraft between April 1942 and November 1943.

Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk (ČKD, called &quot;Böhmisch-Mährische Maschinenfabrik AG&quot; [BMM] in German) in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia delivered the first instrument flight trainer D-0 in January 1943 followed by production of a further 44 D-0 preseries aircraft. The D-1 series was begun in March 1943 by Aero, also in the Protectorate, and by BMM in June or July 1943. In August 1943, SNCAN also delivered their first D-1.

Production of the D-3 was started in October 1944 by Aero Vodochody. The D-3 had wooden wings and a tail-plane made of wood and metal. French production of the D-1 was ended in August 1944 after the Liberation. SNCAN produced a total of 168 units of the Si 204. BMM produced the aircraft until October 1944 and then changed to producing spare parts for the Si 204. The Aero company was scheduled to cease production of the D-1 in March 1945 after building 486 aircraft and then switch to D-3 only. The aircraft, however, was only built until January 1945 with 541 completed.

Therefore, total production was 1,216 (until January 1945) including the prototypes; some production in other countries continued after the war ended.

==Operational history==
The Si 204D was used mainly in B- and C-Schools (advanced schools) and in FÜG 1 (delivery wing of the Luftwaffe), probably as a taxi aircraft for crews who had delivered other aircraft to fighting units. Its use in instrument flight schools was sporadic; for radio schools, no evidence of use has been found. The Si 204A flew mainly with communications squadrons and flying services for senior officers, but also with schools.

In July 1944, five Si 204 were destined to be converted to night-combat aircraft, but no further aircraft were allotted. They were probably intended for the pre-series Si 204 E-0. However, no evidence shows that these aircraft were ever used in combat situations.

Luft Hansa received at least four Si 204s: The first prototype, D-AEFR, was evaluated from March to May 1941 by Luft Hansa Prague. From spring 1942 to spring 1943, the second prototype, D-ASGU, was used on regular routes as a freight carrier.

An Si 204 was likely the last German aircraft shot down on the Western Front. At 8 p.m. on May 8, 1945, 2nd Lt. K. L. Smith of the 9th Air Force&#x27;s 474th Fighter Group, flying a P-38 Lightning, downed a Siebel 3 miles southeast of Rodach, Bavaria.

At the end of the war, one Si 204D remained in Berlin-Tempelhof (named &quot;Rhein&quot;). One flew to Enns in Austria, where it was captured by the Allies.

Captured Si 204s flew in a variety of civil roles in the post-war USSR, serving with Aeroflot until 1949, being particularly successful in Tajikistan regional services. Soviet Polar Aviation flew seven Si 204s, equipped with skis, in Siberia. Major engine deficiencies in the extreme climate conditions, with four aircraft lost, caused local aircrew to nickname the Si 204 &quot;Giebel&quot;, Russian for &quot;disaster&quot;, before withdrawal from the region. The last Soviet Si 204, flying with the Agricultural Survey, was retired in 1951.

==Prototypes==
==Variants==

After the war, a production of Si 204 continued in Czechoslovakia and France. In Czechoslovakia Aero Vodochody produced 179 Si 204D, developed into military trainer variants Aero C-3A and C-3B (the latter for bombardier training), passenger variant C-103 and military transport variant Aero D-44 until 1949. In France SNCAC (&quot;Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre&quot;), commonly known as Aérocentre, produced 240 transport NC.701 Martinets and a number (110?) of passenger NC.702 Martinets. The NC.701 was distinguished by three-blade propellers and was powered by 440 kW (590 hp) Renault 12S-00 engines. The NC.702 had a modified nose.

<doc id="1003722" wikidata="Q7578390" url="?curid=1003722" title="Splash pad">
<text>A splash pad or spray pool is a recreation area, often in a public park, for water play that has little or no standing water. This is said to eliminate the need for lifeguards or other supervision, as there is little risk of drowning.

Typically there are ground nozzles that spray water upwards out of the splash pad&#x27;s raindeck. There may also be other water features such as a rainbow (semicircular pipe shower), or mushroom- or tree-shaped showers. Some splash pads feature movable nozzles similar to those found on fire trucks to allow users to spray others. The showers and ground nozzles are often controlled by a hand activated-motion sensor, to run for limited time.

Typically the water is either freshwater, or recycled and treated water, that is typically treated to at least the same level of quality as swimming pool water standards. These splash pads are often surfaced in textured non-slip concrete or in crumb rubber.

==Definitions==
A typical definition was laid out by a 1986 Heath Act in British Columbia which stated that a spray pool is &quot;an artificially constructed depression or basin for use by children, into which potable water is sprayed but not allowed to accumulate in the bottom.&quot;

Similarly, the city of Norfolk, Virginia, specifically defines a spray pool as &quot;any shallow manmade structure constructed from materials other than natural earth or soil used for spraying humans with water and which has a drainage area designated to remove the water from the shower or spray nozzles at a rate sufficient to prevent the impounding of water.&quot;

Spray pool features may also be referred to as &quot;interactive fountains&quot; or &quot;wet decks&quot;.

===Splash fountains===
Splash fountains, unlike splash pads, encourage use from people of all ages. These fountains are usually designed to be both visually appealing (from a distance) and also interactive. As such, they are designed to allow easy access, often at ground level. They tend to feature nonslip surfaces, and have no standing water, to eliminate possible drowning hazards, so that no lifeguards are required. Multiple fountains may start and stop in unison or according to a pattern for artistic effect. While they may be placed in public parks like children&#x27;s splash pads, splash fountains are also likely to be placed in public squares or at urban beaches.

==Popularity==
Popular in summertime and especially prevalent in urban areas, the spray pool offers an alternative to the practice of opening fire hydrants so that children can play and cool off in the water – a practice which is illegal and has been cited as dangerous in that it lowers the water pressure in a given area and makes firefighting more difficult. A spray pool does not need to be staffed by qualified lifeguards.

==Common features==
===Spray force===
Depending upon the strength and arc of the flow, the force of the spray can be relatively strong (especially close to the point where the water emerges) or may have more resemblance to rainfall or even a fine mist. Many splash pads have some features such as fine mist, that are designed to be moderate enough for children. Other splash fountains are designed for adults, e.g. for joggers or concert goers to cool off in.

===Drainage===
The area beneath a spray pool typically has drain openings so that the water it produces will not flood the surrounding landscape. In some instances, the water collected in these drains is recycled back into the spray mechanism, thereby conserving water. Alternatively, the water emanating from the spray nozzles may be continually drawn from a fresh water supply.

==Special features==
===Hydraulophones===
Hydraulophones are the world&#x27;s first musical instrument that makes music from vibrations in water. By pressing on jets of water laid out to a musical scale, hydraulophones make a unique sound. Hydraulophones have been installed in water parks, museums, and science centres around the world, including the Legoland California Resort, Chicago Children&#x27;s Museum, and the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto.

===Heating===
At the splash fountain at Dundas Square in Toronto, Ontario, the water is heated by solar energy captured by special dark-colored granite slabs.

==Safety==
Inadequately treated, recirculated spray pool systems present a health hazard. In certain jurisdictions, splash pads may not be subject to public swimming pool water quality requirements because they do not contain standing water. People wearing regular clothing and street shoes, pets and young children may introduce pathogens into the spray pool when they cool off in it. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with water parks have occurred in Florida in 1999, in New York in 2005 and in Idaho in 2007. In 2021, a 3-year-old child died after contracting primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) from playing in a Texas water park contaminated with &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;. Another fatal case of PAM occurred in 2023 in a 16-month-old child, with &quot;N. fowleri&quot; testing implicating an Arkansas splash pad as the likely source of the infection.

==Examples==
Placement and management of spray pools varies according to the municipality in which they are located. For example:
*On Boston Common, the so-called &quot;Frog Pond&quot; (which is a public ice-skating rink in winter) becomes a spray pool for children in the summer. The facility is managed by the Boston Common Frog Pond Foundation and staffed by youth workers from the Boston Youth Fund.
* The spray pool at Phillips Park in Aurora, Illinois, dates from the 1930s and has closed and reopened several times. It is now part of the Phillips Park Family Aquatic Center next to the Phillips Park Zoo.
*Seattle &amp; King County, Washington, has a &quot;Plan Guide for Water Recreation Facilities – Spray Pools&quot; listing very specific considerations such as the use of non-slip surfaces and the positioning of the spray pools so as to &quot;minimize pollution by dust, smoke, soot and other undesirable substances.&quot;
*Oregon City, Oregon, has a spray pool at the Oregon City Carnegie Center. Formerly run by the city, the center and its programs recently reopened under the auspices of a private organization called Fine Art Smarts.
*North Berwyn Park District in Berwyn, Illinois, offers a permit for the use of a city-owned community center and spray pool for birthday parties.

<doc id="1003739" wikidata="Q6383670" url="?curid=1003739" title="Keiko Bonk">
<text>Keiko Cecilia Bonk (born 1954) is an American artist, musician and former politician from Hawaii. Bonk co-founded the Green Party of Hawaii and was the first person in North America elected to a partisan level office as a member of the Green Party of the United States. In the US most local elected offices are nonpartisan, meaning the candidate is not running as a member of a political party. State and federal offices are partisan, meaning that the candidates represent political parties. In Hawaii local government, such as county government, it was formerly necessary to declare your political party. Other people who called themselves &quot;Greens&quot; had been elected to local government offices in the United States prior to Keiko Bonk, but they were not representing a legally established political party. In the United States, it is very difficult to win an election in a partisan race if the candidate does not run as a Democrat or Republican. Keiko Bonk was the first person in the United States to run as a representative of the Green Party and beat a Republican and Democrat.

==Life==
Born July 13, 1954 in Honolulu, her mother was Fumie Matsuoka and her father was William Bonk. Bill was a professor at the University of Hawaii. He was an anthropologist/archeologist who studied Native Hawaiian. He worked with Kenneth Emory to date the first arrival of people to the Hawaiian islands. Fumie was a public school teacher and ceramicist. Bill and Fumie were both stalwart figures in the progressive wing of the Hawaii Democratic Party, working for decades to elect many of the states most prominent politicians. 

Keiko grew up making art with her mother, working on archeological digs with her father, and participating in electoral politics with both. When Keiko co-founded the Hawaii Green Party with University of Hawaii professor, Ira Rhoter, and decided to run for office herself, the more conservative members of Hawaii&#x27;s Democratic Party saw the Green Party as a threat to the Democratic Party, and organized to defeat Keiko. Her father, who worked for the Democratic Governor as the Director of the Office of Culture and Historic Preservation, publicly resigned his position, quit the Democratic Party, and joined the Green party to support his daughter&#x27;s political career.

Bonk attended Hilo High School on the Island of Hawaii and graduated in 1972. She then attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where she obtained a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1976. Bonk went on to achieve a master of fine arts degree from Hunter College in New York City in 1982.

==Art==
Bonk&#x27;s first career was as a painter and musician in New York. She sang in the bands &quot;His Masters Voice,&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Oven,&quot; in the 1980s.

After returning to her home in Hawaii, Bonk continued to play original music and paint. Her first band was the Monkey Wrench Gang. She then formed a new band called &quot;Kazan&quot;, and released a CD called &quot;Save the World&quot; in 2007.

Keiko had a show of her paintings at the Honolulu Academy of Art in 2009. She then spent 15 years caring for her parents and other elderly family members. Her mother Fumie was the last, and passed died in 2019.

==Politics==
Bonk made her national political reputation as an elected official by becoming the first person in North America elected to a partisan level office as a member of the Green Party. She was one of the co-founders of the Green Party in Hawaii. She was elected to two terms on the Hawaii County Council from 1992 to 1996, and as chair of the council from 1995 to 1996. In 1996 and 2000 she ran for mayor. In 1996 she was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent, Stephen K. Yamashiro. In 2000 she was defeated by Harry Kim, who ran as a Republican. Bonk worked building the Green Party, and spoke in support of Ralph Nader as the presidential nominee of the Green Party in 1996.

After leaving office Bonk taught art at the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo. She moved to Honolulu with her second husband, Michael Christopher, when he returned to school to pursue a second doctoral degree. Christopher holds doctorates in sociology and clinical psychology, and has been her political partner even before they married in 1998. She met Christopher after he heard of her electoral success. She put him on the county payroll even as she began an affair with him. This led to cries of impropriety. Comments still abound that he is the power behind her. 

After moving to Honolulu, Bonk was chosen as Executive Director of the Japanese Cultural Center in Honolulu in 2003. She was fired in February 2005 by its board of directors citing &quot;philosophical differences&quot;.

Bonk went on to become the campaign coordinator of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Network. She promoted Congress&#x27; investigation into corruption in Western Pacific Fisheries Management Council, the government advisory council responsible for management of the pacific fishery. Bonk worked as the Executive Director of the Hawaii branch of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI).

In 2012 Keiko Bonk was nominated as the Green Party candidate for Hawaii House of Representatives, 20th district. The incumbent in that district, Democrat Calvin Say was easily reelected.

<text>Saybrook College is one of the 14 residential colleges at Yale University.

==Buildings and architecture==


The building now known as Saybrook and Branford Colleges was built as the Memorial Quadrangle on the site of what was once the old gymnasium. Designed by James Gamble Rogers, the quadrangle was built from 1917 to 1922. In 1928, Edward Harkness, who had funded the Memorial Quadrangle project, gave Yale funding to build eight residential colleges, and administrators decided to reconfigure the building into two of the new colleges. The two northern courtyards became the center of Saybrook College, and a wall of dormitories on the college&#x27;s south side was demolished to build a dining hall and common room for the new college.

The courtyards are named for the towns Yale occupied before its move to New Haven: Killingworth Court after Killingworth, Connecticut, where Rector Abraham Pierson first held classes, and Saybrook Court after Old Saybrook, Connecticut, where it resided as the Collegiate School from 1703 to 1718. Among the flagstones of each courtyard is a millstone originating from their respective namesakes. The main courtyards are also decorated with carvings and inscriptions. Around the entryways are the stone heads of various associates of Yale University, including Vance McCormick, former chairman of the Yale Corporation&#x27;s architectural planning committee, and Russell Chittenden, former director of the Sheffield Scientific School. In Saybrook Court are the arms of several American universities and of Elihu Yale and Edward Harkness. In Killingworth Court are the arms of Yale, Harvard, and Saybrook&#x27;s sister colleges Adams House and Emmanuel College. Each student room is decorated with panes of stained glass from G. Owen Bonawit.

Wrexham Tower, modeled after the tower of St. Giles&#x27; Church in Wrexham, Wales, where Elihu Yale is buried, stands in the college&#x27;s westernmost corner over a very small courtyard of its own. In the tower&#x27;s base is an inscribed stone sent from St. Giles&#x27; as a gift to Yale. On the wall across from the tower&#x27;s entrance is a plaque commemorating James Gamble Rogers.

Saybrook&#x27;s freshmen were housed in Lanman-Wright Hall and Bingham Hall on Old Campus (as were the freshmen of Pierson College). Lanman-Wright Hall was designed by William Adams Delano and constructed in 1912. Starting in the fall of 2011, Saybrook&#x27;s freshmen are now housed in Vanderbilt Hall.

The college was renovated during the 2000-2001 year.

==Arms and badge==
The arms of Saybrook College are the quartering of the arms of William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele and of Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, who were the early promoters of the Saybrook Colony, where Yale would later be founded. The arms of Saybrook College are described heraldically as: &quot;Quarterly I and IV azure, three lions rampant or; II and III sable, an engrailed cross within a border engrailed both or, and five roundels sable on the cross.&quot;

The badge of Saybrook College is the grapevine, derived from the original seal of Saybrook Colony. The badge appears carved in various places around the college.

==Saybrook strip song==
Saybrook students are known on campus for &quot;the Saybrook Strip&quot;, a ritual performed during football games at the end of the third quarter. Male and female college residents strip down to their underwear (some seniors remove all their clothing during The Game)
The words to the Saybrook strip song change to accommodate the names of the current Head of College and Dean.

==Heads and Deans==
Elisha Atkins served as master of the college from 1975 to 1985, followed by Ann Ameling, the first female master of Saybrook. 

Antonio Lasaga, a highly regarded geochemist, began a term as master in 1996. His service abruptly ended in 1998 when the FBI searched his house for a collection of child pornography, and in 2002 he was given a 20-year jail sentence for the sexual assault of a child. Mary Miller, a scholar of Mesoamerican art, was appointed master in 1999 to restore the college&#x27;s structure and morale. After a nine-year term, Miller was appointed dean of Yale College in December 2008. Her husband, Edward Kamens, served as interim master. 

In the fall of 2009, computer science professor Paul Hudak became the ninth master of Saybrook. One of the designers of the Haskell programming language and a jazz pianist, Hudak did work in Haskore, a programming language used for sound production. He was head coach of Hamden High&#x27;s women&#x27;s lacrosse team for eight years. He was married to Cathy Van Dyke, and had two daughters, Cris Hudak and Jen Hudak. He was also the only Master of Saybrook to have participated in the Saybrook Strip. In November 2010, Hudak took a medical leave of absence; Kamens served again as interim master until Hudak returned at the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year. Hudak resigned from the mastership and died three months later. 
In 2016, the title of &quot;Master&quot; was changed to &quot;Head of College&quot;.

<doc id="1003781" wikidata="Q1315297" url="?curid=1003781" title="QuickTime VR">
<text>QuickTime VR (also known as QTVR) is an image file format developed by Apple Inc. for QuickTime, and discontinued along with QuickTime 7. It allows the creation and viewing of VR photography, photographically captured panoramas, and the viewing of objects photographed from multiple angles. It functions as plugins for the QuickTime Player and for the QuickTime Web browser plugin.

==History==
QuickTime VR was conceived in 1991 by programmers Eric Chen and Ian Small of the Human Interface Group in the Advanced Technology Group at Apple, utilizing a Cray supercomputer to process images into panoramas. It was soon made prominent within the company by Apple&#x27;s board member and former astronaut Sally Ride, who was fascinated by the demonstrated possibilities of 3D computer imagery.

It was publicly launched in 1995 as part of QuickTime 2, by a dedicated group including Chen, Small, senior content engineer Ted Casey, and program manager Eric Zarakov. Apple sold the content authoring tools for plus a $0.40-0.80 royalty fee per commercial CD-ROM disc depending on the number of QuickTime VR movies, or no royalty charge for non-commercial usage. Upon launch, it was a supporting technology in digital publications such as the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual&quot;. The first high-profile public application of QuickTime VR is the 1995 courtroom visualization of the crime scenes in the O. J. Simpson murder case.

The platform was deemphasized upon the return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997. The discontinuation of QuickTime 7 in the late 2000s brought the end of development and support of QuickTime VR and other major technologies.

==Overview==
===Panoramas===
Panoramas are panoramic images which surround the viewer with an environment (inside, looking out), yielding a sense of place. 
They can be stitched together from several normal photographs or 2 images taken with a circular fisheye lens, or captured with specialized panoramic cameras, or rendered from 3D-modeled scenes. 
There are two types of panoramas:
* Single row panoramas, with a single horizontal row of photographs.
* Multi-row panoramas, with several rows of photographs taken at different tilt angles.
Panoramas are further divided into those that include the top and bottom, called cubic or spherical panoramas, and those that do not, usually called cylindrical.

A single panorama, or node, is captured from a single point in space. Several nodes and object movies can be linked together to allow a viewer to move from one location to another. Such multinode QuickTime VR movies are called scenes.

Apple&#x27;s QuickTime VR file format has two representations for panoramic nodes:
* cylindrical, consisting of one 360° image wrapped around the viewer
* cubic, consisting of a cube of six 90° × 90° images surrounding the viewer.
Each of these are typically subdivided or tiled into several smaller images, and stored in a special kind of QuickTime movie file, which requires the QuickTime plugin. 

Hot spots can be embedded into the panorama, which when selected can invoke some action, for example moving to another panorama node.

===Objects===
In contrast to panoramas, which are captured from one location looking out at various angles, objects are captured from many locations pointing in toward the same central object.

The simplest type of objects to capture are single row, typically captured around the equator of an object. This is normally facilitated by a rotating turntable. The object is placed on the turntable, and photographed at equal angular increments (usually 10°) from a camera mounted on a tripod. 

Capturing a multi-row object movie requires a more elaborate setup for capturing images, because the camera must be tilted above and below the equator of the object at several tilt angles. 

==Reception==
In 1995, &quot;MacWorld&quot; cited some pioneering multimedia developers with a shared viewpoint fanatically in favor of QuickTime VR technology but against Apple&#x27;s $0.40-$0.80 royalty fee per commercial CD-ROM unit plus fee for authoring tools, and some halting their existing efforts in protest. The magazine&#x27;s exhaustive overview concluded with this: &quot;QuickTime VR is an impressive achievement that reinforces Apple&#x27;s role as the innovator in personal computer multimedia. But Apple&#x27;s zeal to turn QuickTime VR into a profit center may slow its initial adoption and perhaps even relegate it to the backseat of Microsoft&#x27;s limousine. As this issue went to press, Apple was reconsidering its requirement that developers pay royalties on titles that incorporate QuickTime VR. As well it should.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reflected on the long-term impact of QuickTime VR: &quot;It&#x27;s difficult not to read about Apple&#x27;s experiments with panoramic images and not draw a connection to the recent rise of 360-degree videos on platforms like Facebook and YouTube — or even the immersive aspects of services like Google Maps Street View. Much of what&#x27;s called VR these days isn&#x27;t a full interactive environment, but is instead a descendant of the panoramic images that Apple pioneered.&quot;

<text>Teixeira de Freitas is a city in the extreme south of the Brazilian state of Bahia, on the margins of BR-101 highway. It is one of the largest cities in the state, with a population estimated at 162,438 inhabitants in an area of 1,166 km2.

==History==
The city had its origin as a crossroads, and has always maintained its character as a place that draws entrepreneurs from other regions. Major expansion of industry in the area, combined with the growth of eucalyptus plantations, has adversely impacted small-scale agriculture in the surrounding rural areas, resulting in declining population in those rural areas. Teixeira de Freitas has also a busy commercial district and the economy has developed a lot lately thanks to the migration of the population from surrounding towns.

==Economy==

It has an agricultural economy, based in cattle ranching and raising crops. There is also a large production of Eucalyptus destined to the extraction of cellulose on factories in the region. The city is a regional commercial center, serving approximately 14 municipalities.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
The climate of Teixeira de Freitas is considered tropical (type Am in the climatic classification of Köppen-Geiger ), with significant rainfall in most of the months and average annual temperature of 24.3 °C. August is the driest month of the year, with an average of 58 mm of precipitation. November is the month with the highest level of precipitation, with an average of 136 mm. The warmest month of the year is January with an average temperature of 26.2 °C, while June is the coldest, with an average temperature of 22.0 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1099 mm.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Education ===
In the year 2015, the municipality contained 50 preschool institutions, 76 primary education institutions and 12 high schools. In total, there are 30,131 enrolled students.

Teixeira de Freitas is a center of regional education, offering technical and higher education courses for the local population and nearby cities. The Federal Institute Baiano (IF Baiano) the campus Paulo Freire of the Federal University of Southern Bahia (UFSB), the campus X Bahia State University (UNEB), two campuses of the Faculty of the South of Bahia (FASB), and a campus of the Pitágoras Faculty (Pitágoras) are all located in the municipality, in addition to other technical and higher education institutions.

==Transportation==
Teixeira de Freitas had a regional airport, with flights to Belo Horizonte every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

<doc id="1003796" wikidata="Q3297439" url="?curid=1003796" title="Ada (computer virus)">
<text>Ada is a computer virus that can affect any of the DOS operating systems. Ada was first discovered in 1991.

==History==
Ada virus was first discovered in Argentina in .

==Characteristics==
Ada is a memory resident virus that infects files. The Ada virus mainly targets .COM files, specifically COMMAND.COM and stays in the memory of the computer it infects after the program it infected executes.

Infected programs have 2,600 bytes additional data inserted at the beginning of the file, and the file itself contains the text strings:
* 
* 

Another version of Ada has these text strings along with the strings repeated numerous times.

Computers infected with the Ada virus often have a slow clicking sound emitting from their speakers; this clicking may sometimes change in pitch. Infected computers may show a &quot;Disk Full&quot; error even if the disk still has space on it.

While infected with the Ada virus, system memory measured by the DOS CHKDSK decreases by 21,296 bytes to 21,312 bytes. The virus resides in the memory after an infected file is run and will infect any other .COM files executed on the computer. It also hijacks interrupts 08, 13 and 21.

==Infection route==
There is only one way to infect a computer with the Ada virus; by executing an infected file. The infected file may come from a variety of sources: floppy disks, files downloaded from the Internet, and infected networks.

<doc id="1003802" wikidata="Q1545633" url="?curid=1003802" title="Netfilter">
<text>Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network and prohibiting packets from reaching sensitive locations within a network.

Netfilter represents a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel, allowing specific kernel modules to register callback functions with the kernel&#x27;s networking stack. Those functions, usually applied to the traffic in the form of filtering and modification rules, are called for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the networking stack.

==History==
Rusty Russell started the &quot;netfilter/iptables project&quot; in 1998; he had also authored the project&#x27;s predecessor, ipchains. As the project grew, he founded the &quot;Netfilter Core Team&quot; (or simply &quot;coreteam&quot;) in 1999. The software they produced (called &quot;netfilter&quot; hereafter) uses the GNU General Public License (GPL) license, and on 26 August 1999 it was merged into version 2.3.15 of the Linux kernel mainline and thus was in the 2.4.0 stable version.

In August 2003 Harald Welte became chairman of the coreteam. In April 2004, following a crack-down by the project on those distributing the project&#x27;s software embedded in routers without complying with the GPL, a German court granted Welte an historic injunction against Sitecom Germany, which refused to follow the GPL&#x27;s terms (see GPL-related disputes). In September 2007 Patrick McHardy, who led development for past years, was elected as new chairman of the coreteam.

Prior to iptables, the predominant software packages for creating Linux firewalls were ipchains in Linux kernel 2.2.x and ipfwadm in Linux kernel 2.0.x, which in turn was based on BSD&#x27;s ipfw. Both ipchains and ipfwadm alter the networking code so they can manipulate packets, as Linux kernel lacked a general packets control framework until the introduction of Netfilter.

Whereas ipchains and ipfwadm combine packet filtering and NAT (particularly three specific kinds of NAT, called &quot;masquerading&quot;, &quot;port forwarding&quot;, and &quot;redirection&quot;), Netfilter separates packet operations into multiple parts, described below. Each connects to the Netfilter hooks at different points to access packets. The connection tracking and NAT subsystems are more general and more powerful than the rudimentary versions within ipchains and ipfwadm.

In 2017 IPv4 and IPv6 flow offload infrastructure was added, allowing a speedup of software flow table forwarding and hardware offload support.

==Userspace utility programs==
* 
* 
* 

===iptables===
The kernel modules named codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (the underscore is part of the name), and codice_4 comprise the legacy packet filtering portion of the Netfilter hook system. They provide a table-based system for defining firewall rules that can filter or transform packets. The tables can be administered through the user-space tools codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, and codice_4. Notice that although both the kernel modules and userspace utilities have similar names, each of them is a different entity with different functionality.

Each table is actually its own hook, and each table was introduced to serve a specific purpose. As far as Netfilter is concerned, it runs a particular table in a specific order with respect to other tables. Any table can call itself and it also can execute its own rules, which enables possibilities for additional processing and iteration.

Rules are organized into chains, or in other words, &quot;chains of rules&quot;. These chains are named with predefined titles, including codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11. These chain titles help describe the origin in the Netfilter stack. Packet reception, for example, falls into codice_12, while the codice_9 represents locally delivered data, and forwarded traffic falls into the codice_11 chain. Locally generated output passes through the codice_10 chain, and packets to be sent out are in codice_16 chain.

Netfilter modules not organized into tables (see below) are capable of checking for the origin to select their mode of operation.

; codice_17 module
: When loaded, registers a hook that will be called before any other Netfilter hook. It provides a table called &quot;raw&quot; that can be used to filter packets before they reach more memory-demanding operations such as Connection Tracking.
;codice_18 module
: Registers a hook and &quot;mangle&quot; table to run after Connection Tracking (see below) (but still before any other table), so that modifications can be made to the packet. This enables additional modifications by rules that follow, such as NAT or further filtering.
; codice_19 module
: Registers two hooks: Destination Network Address Translation-based transformations (&quot;DNAT&quot;) are applied before the filter hook, Source Network Address Translation-based transformations (&quot;SNAT&quot;) are applied afterwards. The &quot;network address translation&quot; table (or &quot;nat&quot;) that is made available to iptables is merely a &quot;configuration database&quot; for NAT mappings only, and not intended for filtering of any kind.
; codice_20 module
: Registers the &quot;filter&quot; table, used for general-purpose filtering (firewalling).
; codice_21 module
: Used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules, such as those enabled by the codice_22 and codice_23 targets. (These so-called &quot;targets&quot; refer to Security-Enhanced Linux markers.) Mandatory Access Control is implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux. The security table is called following the call of the filter table, allowing any Discretionary Access Control (DAC) rules in the filter table to take effect before any MAC rules. This table provides the following built-in chains: codice_9 (for packets coming into the computer itself), codice_10 (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and codice_11 (for altering packets being routed through the computer).

===nftables===
nftables is the new packet-filtering portion of Netfilter. codice_27 is the new userspace utility that replaces codice_5, codice_6, codice_7 and codice_4.

nftables kernel engine adds a simple virtual machine into the Linux kernel, which is able to execute bytecode to inspect a network packet and make decisions on how that packet should be handled. The operations implemented by this virtual machine are intentionally made basic: it can get data from the packet itself, have a look at the associated metadata (inbound interface, for example), and manage connection tracking data. Arithmetic, bitwise and comparison operators can be used for making decisions based on that data. The virtual machine is also capable of manipulating sets of data (typically IP addresses), allowing multiple comparison operations to be replaced with a single set lookup.

This is in contrast to the legacy Xtables (iptables, etc.) code, which has protocol awareness so deeply built into the code that it has had to be replicated four timesfor IPv4, IPv6, ARP, and Ethernet bridgingas the firewall engines are too protocol-specific to be used in a generic manner. The main advantages over codice_5 are simplification of the Linux kernel ABI, reduction of code duplication, improved error reporting, and more efficient execution, storage, and incremental, atomic changes of filtering rules.

==Packet defragmentation==
The codice_33 module will defragment IPv4 packets before they reach Netfilter&#x27;s connection tracking (codice_34 module). This is necessary for the in-kernel connection tracking and NAT helper modules (which are a form of &quot;mini-ALGs&quot;) that only work reliably on entire packets, not necessarily on fragments.

The IPv6 defragmenter is not a module in its own right, but is integrated into the codice_35 module.

==Connection tracking==
One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way, and codice_5 can use this information to act as a stateful firewall.

The connection state however is completely independent of any upper-level state, such as TCP&#x27;s or SCTP&#x27;s state. Part of the reason for this is that when merely forwarding packets, i.e. no local delivery, the TCP engine may not necessarily be invoked at all. Even connectionless-mode transmissions such as UDP, IPsec (AH/ESP), GRE and other tunneling protocols have, at least, a pseudo connection state. The heuristic for such protocols is often based upon a preset timeout value for inactivity, after whose expiration a Netfilter connection is dropped.

Each Netfilter connection is uniquely identified by a (layer-3 protocol, source address, destination address, layer-4 protocol, layer-4 key) tuple. The layer-4 key depends on the transport protocol; for TCP/UDP it is the port numbers, for tunnels it can be their tunnel ID, but otherwise is just zero, as if it were not part of the tuple. To be able to inspect the TCP port in all cases, packets will be mandatorily defragmented.

Netfilter connections can be manipulated with the user-space tool codice_37.

codice_5 can make use of checking the connection&#x27;s information such as states, statuses and more to make packet filtering rules more powerful and easier to manage. The most common states are:
; codice_39: trying to create a new connection
; codice_40: part of an already-existing connection
; codice_41: assigned to a packet that is initiating a new connection and which has been &quot;expected&quot;; the aforementioned mini-ALGs set up these expectations, for example, when the codice_42 module sees an FTP &quot;codice_43&quot; command
; codice_44: the packet was found to be invalid, e.g. it would not adhere to the TCP state diagram
; codice_45: a special state that can be assigned by the administrator to bypass connection tracking for a particular packet (see raw table, above).

A normal example would be that the first packet the conntrack subsystem sees will be classified &quot;new&quot;, the reply would be classified &quot;established&quot; and an ICMP error would be &quot;related&quot;. An ICMP error packet which did not match any known connection would be &quot;invalid&quot;.

===Connection tracking helpers===
Through the use of plugin modules, connection tracking can be given knowledge of application-layer protocols and thus understand that two or more distinct connections are &quot;related&quot;. For example, consider the FTP protocol. A control connection is established, but whenever data is transferred, a separate connection is established to transfer it. When the codice_42 module is loaded, the first packet of an FTP data connection will be classified as &quot;related&quot; instead of &quot;new&quot;, as it is logically part of an existing connection.

The helpers only inspect one packet at a time, so if vital information for connection tracking is split across two packets, either due to IP fragmentation or TCP segmentation, the helper will not necessarily recognize patterns and therefore not perform its operation. IP fragmentation is dealt with the connection tracking subsystem requiring defragmentation, though TCP segmentation is not handled. In case of FTP, segmentation is deemed not to happen &quot;near&quot; a command like codice_43 with standard segment sizes, so is not dealt with in Netfilter either.

==Network address translation==
Each connection has a set of &quot;original addresses&quot; and &quot;reply addresses&quot;, which initially start out the same. NAT in Netfilter is implemented by simply changing the reply address, and where desired, port. When packets are received, their connection tuple will also be compared against the reply address pair (and ports). Being fragment-free is also a requirement for NAT. (If need be, IPv4 packets may be refragmented by the normal, non-Netfilter, IPv4 stack.)

===NAT helpers===
Similar to connection tracking helpers, NAT helpers will do a packet inspection and substitute original addresses by reply addresses in the payload.

==Further Netfilter projects==
Though not being kernel modules that make use of Netfilter code directly, the Netfilter project hosts a few more noteworthy software.

===conntrack-tools===
codice_48 is a set of user-space tools for Linux that allow system administrators to interact with the Connection Tracking entries and tables. The package includes the codice_49 daemon and the command line interface codice_37. The userspace daemon codice_49 can be used to enable high availability cluster-based stateful firewalls and collect statistics of the stateful firewall use. The command line interface codice_37 provides a more flexible interface to the connection tracking system than the obsolete codice_53.

===ipset===
Unlike other extensions such as Connection Tracking, codice_54 is more related to codice_5 than it is to the core Netfilter code. codice_54 does not make use of Netfilter hooks for instance, but actually provides an codice_5 module to match and do minimal modifications (set/clear) to IP sets.

The user-space tool called codice_54 is used to set up, maintain and inspect so called &quot;IP sets&quot; in the Linux kernel. An IP set usually contains a set of IP addresses, but can also contain sets of other network numbers, depending on its &quot;type&quot;. These sets are much more lookup-efficient than bare codice_5 rules, but of course may come with a greater memory footprint. Different storage algorithms (for the data structures in memory) are provided in codice_54 for the user to select an optimum solution.

Any entry in one set can be bound to another set, allowing for sophisticated matching operations. A set can only be removed (destroyed) if there are no codice_5 rules or other sets referring to it.

===SYN proxy===
codice_62 target makes handling of large SYN floods possible without the large performance penalties imposed by the connection tracking in such cases. By redirecting initial codice_63 requests to the codice_62 target, connections are not registered within the connection tracking until they reach a validated final codice_65 state, freeing up connection tracking from accounting large numbers of potentially invalid connections. This way, huge codice_63 floods can be handled in an effective way.

On 3 November 2013, codice_63 proxy functionality was merged into the Netfilter, with the release of version 3.12 of the Linux kernel mainline.

===ulogd===
codice_68 is a user-space daemon to receive and log packets and event notifications from the Netfilter subsystems. codice_1 can deliver packets via the userspace queueing mechanism to it, and connection tracking can interact with codice_68 to exchange further information about packets or events (such as connection teardown, NAT setup).

===Userspace libraries===
Netfilter also provides a set of libraries having codice_71 as a prefix of their names, that can be used to perform different tasks from the userspace. These libraries are released under the GNU GPL version 2. Specifically, they are the following:
; codice_72
: allows to perform userspace packet queueing in conjunction with iptables; based on codice_73
; codice_74
: allows manipulation of connection tracking entries from the userspace; based on codice_73
; codice_76
: allows collection of log messages generated by iptables; based on codice_73
; codice_78
: allows operations on queues, connection tracking and logs; part of the codice_79 project
; codice_80
: allows changes to be performed to the iptables firewall rulesets; it is not based on any codice_81 library, and its API is internally used by the codice_5 utilities
; codice_83
: allows operations on IP sets; based on codice_84.

==Netfilter workshops==
The Netfilter project organizes an annual meeting for developers, which is used to discuss ongoing research and development efforts. The 2018 Netfilter workshop took place in Berlin, Germany, in June 2018.

<doc id="1003805" wikidata="Q38449" url="?curid=1003805" title="Havanese dog">
<text>The Havanese, a bichon-type dog, is the national dog of Cuba, developed from the now extinct &quot;Blanquito de la Habana&quot; (&quot;little white dog of Havana&quot;). The &quot;Blanquito&quot; descended from the also now-extinct Bichón Tenerife. It is believed that the &quot;Blanquito&quot; was eventually cross-bred with other bichon types, including the poodle, to create what is now known as the Havanese. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;Havana Silk Dogs&quot;, but this is a separate breed, which has been bred to meet the original Cuban standards.

==Characteristics==

===Appearance===
The Havanese is a toy dog with a silky coat. The height of the Havanese ranges from at the withers with being the ideal height. The body, measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall.

A unique aspect of the breed is the topline, which rises just slightly from withers to the croup, creating a topline that is straight but not level. Renowned for their flashy, lively gait, their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far-reaching one. The angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait.

The muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose. It does not have the appearance of being short or snipy. Length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle. The top of the skull is rather flat and the back skull is rounded.

The length from foot to elbow is equal to the length from elbow to withers. The fore chest is pronounced. When in a standing position, the sternum lines up with the elbows, creating a deep chest. Ribs are well-sprung and the abdomen is moderately tucked up.

The Havanese has solid black eyes — except for the chocolate colored dogs which may have brown eyes — and almond-shaped lids surrounded by black pigment. The ears, when extended, reach halfway to the nose. They arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face. The tail is carried arched forward up over the back. While the tail&#x27;s long plume of hair falls on the body, the tail itself never touches the back.

====Coat and color====
Havanese have a long and furnished double coat. The coat is long, soft, lightweight, and silky. The Havanese coat is slightly wavy, profuse, and undulating. Unlike other double-coated breeds, the Havanese outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense, but rather soft and light. The undercoat is sometimes completely absent. The Havanese coat should be very soft, almost cool to the touch, like silk.

The coat is shown naturally brushed out or corded, a technique which turns the long coat into cords of hair, similar to dreadlocks in humans.

Although there are a few arguments on whether the original Havanese were all white or of different colors , modern Havanese are acceptable in all coat colors and patterns. All colored dogs should have a black nose and black pigment around the eyes, with the exception of chocolate (brown) dogs, which may have dark brown pigment on their nose instead.


==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.5 years compared to 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds from a sample of 56 Havanese dogs.

Havanese suffer primarily from luxating patella, liver disease, heart disease, cataracts and retinal dysplasia.

The Havanese is predisposed to sebaceous adenitis.

A study of over 90,000 dogs attending the University of California-Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital found the Havanese to be predisposed to portosystemic shunt: 4.35% of Havanese had the condition compared to 0.35% for mixed-breed dogs.

==History==
The Havanese is a member of the bichon family of dogs. The progenitors of the breed are believed to have come from Tenerife. Ship manifests from Tenerife bound for Cuba list dogs as passengers brought aboard, and these dogs were most probably the dog of Tenerife. Some believe the entire bichon family of dogs can be traced back to the Tenerife dog, while others theorize that the origins are in Malta, citing the writings of Aristotle, and other historical evidence of the early presence of such dogs in Malta. Whatever the actual origins of bichon dogs, these little dogs soon became devoted companions to the Spanish colonists in Cuba and were highly admired by the nobility.

As part of the Cuban Revolution, upper-class Cubans and others marked out for annihilation by the communists fled to the United States, but few were able to bring their dogs. When American breeders became interested in this rare and charming dog in the 1970s, the US gene pool was only 11 dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) only officially recognized the Havanese breed in 1996.

With dedicated breeding, and the acquisition of some new dogs internationally, the Havanese has made a huge comeback and is one of the fastest growing breeds of dogs in the AKC. The 2013 AKC statistics rank the Havanese as the 25th most popular pure-breed in the United States, a rise in popularity from 28th place in 2012.

==Activities==

Because of the Havanese&#x27;s friendly and readily trained nature, it is used for a variety of jobs involving the public, including therapy dogs, assistance dogs, such as signal dogs for the hearing impaired, performing dogs, mold and termite detection, and tracking.

Havanese also compete in a variety of dog sports, such as dog agility, flyball, musical canine freestyle, and obedience training.

==As show dogs==

The breed standard notes that except for slight trimming around the feet to allow for a tidy foot, they are to be shown untrimmed; any further trimming, back-combing, or other fussing is against type and will not be allowed to the point of precluding placement in dog shows. The breed standard specifies that the tail may not be docked. The American Kennel Club Standard allows head furnishings above each eye to be held in two small braids secured with plain elastic bands.

<text>The Guide is a 1958 novel written in English by the Indian author R. K. Narayan. Like most of his works, the events of this novel take place in Malgudi, a fictional town in South India. The novel describes the transformation of the protagonist, Raju, from a tour guide to a spiritual guide and then one of the greatest holy men of India.

This novel earned Narayan the first 1960 Sahitya Akademi Award for English, by the Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot summary==
The protagonist, Raju, who is nicknamed &quot;Railway Raju&quot;, is characterized as being a corrupt and popular tour guide. In the story, he falls in love with a beautiful woman named Rosie, who is married to an archaeologist named Marco, while the couple is visiting Malgudi as tourists. Marco disapproves of Rosie&#x27;s passion for dancing but Raju encourages Rosie to pursue her dreams and become a dancer. With this interaction, they begin to spend time with each other and become very close. 

Upon learning about their relationship, Marco leaves Rosie in Malgudi and returns to Madras alone. Rosie seeks refuge at Raju&#x27;s home, and they start living together. However, Raju&#x27;s mother does not approve of their relationship and leaves them. 

Raju becomes Rosie&#x27;s stage manager, and with his marketing tactics, Rosie gains recognition as a dancer. With his success, Raju becomes overly confident and begins to assert more control over Rosie&#x27;s life for financial gain. He becomes involved in a forgery case related to Rosie&#x27;s signature. Raju is sentenced to two years in prison, despite Rosie&#x27;s defence. 

After completing his sentence, Raju passes through a village called Mangal, where he is mistaken for a &quot;sadhu&quot; (a spiritual guide). To avoid returning to Malgudi in disgrace, he decides to stay in an abandoned temple near Mangal. There, he takes on the role of a sadhu, delivering sermons and solving the villagers&#x27; daily problems and disputes. 

During a famine in the village, some of the villagers request help from Raju, believing that rain will come and end the famine if he fasts. Raju decides to confess his entire past to Velan, who had initially discovered him in the temple and had unwavering faith in him like the rest of the villagers. However, Velan remains unchanged by the confession, and Raju resolves to continue with the fast. 

As news of Raju&#x27;s fast spreads through the media, a large crowd gathers to witness the spectacle, much to Raju&#x27;s annoyance. On the morning of the eleventh day of his fast, he goes to the riverside as part of his daily ritual. He senses rain falling in the distant hills and collapses into the water. Whether it actually rained or if Raju died remains unknown and open to the reader&#x27;s interpretation.

==Adaptations==
The film &quot;Guide&quot; was released in 1965, based on the novel. It was directed by Vijay Anand. It starred Dev Anand as Raju, Waheeda Rehman as Rosie, and Leela Chitnis in the lead roles. The film&#x27;s score was composed by S. D. Burman. The movie&#x27;s ending differs from that of the novel, in which the fate of some characters remain unanswered.

A 120-minute U.S. version was written by Pearl S. Buck, and directed and produced by Tad Danielewski. The film was screened at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, 42 years after its release.

The novel was also adapted into a play in 1968. The play was profiled in the William Goldman book &quot;The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway&quot;.

<doc id="1003832" wikidata="Q402282" url="?curid=1003832" title="Prague linguistic circle">
<text>The Prague school or Prague linguistic circle is a language and literature society. It started in 1926 as a group of linguists, philologists and literary critics in Prague. Its proponents developed methods of structuralist literary analysis and a theory of the standard language and of language cultivation from 1928 to 1939. The linguistic circle was founded in the Café Derby in Prague, which is also where meetings took place during its first years.

The Prague School has had a significant continuing influence on linguistics and semiotics. After the Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état of 1948, the circle was disbanded in 1952, but the Prague School continued as a major force in linguistic functionalism (distinct from the Copenhagen school or English Firthian – later Hallidean – linguistics). The American scholar Dell Hymes cites his 1962 paper &quot;The Ethnography of Speaking&quot; as the formal introduction of Prague functionalism to American linguistic anthropology. The Prague structuralists also had a significant influence on structuralist film theory, especially through the introduction of the ostensive sign.

Today the Prague linguistic circle is a scholarly society which aims to contribute to the knowledge of language and related sign systems according to functionally structural principles. To this end, it organizes regular meetings with lectures and debates, publishes professional publications, and organizes international meetings.

==History==
The Prague linguistic circle included the Russian émigrés Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, and Sergei Karcevskiy, as well as the famous Czech literary scholars René Wellek and Jan Mukařovský. The instigator of the circle, and its first president until his death in 1945, was the Czech linguist Vilém Mathesius.

In 1929 the Circle promulgated its theses in a paper submitted to the First Congress of Slavists. &quot;The programmatic 1929 Prague &quot;Theses&quot;, surely one of the most imposing linguistic edifices of the 20th century, incapsulated [sic] the functionalist credo.&quot; In the late 20th century, English translations of the Circle&#x27;s seminal works were published by the Czech linguist Josef Vachek in several collections.

Also in 1929, the group launched a journal, &quot;Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Prague&quot;. World War II brought an end to it. The &quot;Travaux&quot; was briefly resurrected in 1966–1971. The inaugural issue was devoted to the political science concept of center and periphery. It was resurrected yet again in 1995. The group&#x27;s Czech language work is published in &quot;Slovo a slovesnost&quot; (Word and Literature).

<doc id="1003833" wikidata="Q1422324" url="?curid=1003833" title="Telecommunications Management Network">
<text>The Telecommunications Management Network is a protocol model defined by ITU-T for managing open systems in a communications network. It is part of the ITU-T Recommendation series M.3000 and is based on the OSI management specifications in ITU-T Recommendation series X.700.

TMN provides a framework for achieving interconnectivity and communication across heterogeneous operations system and telecommunication networks. To achieve this, TMN defines a set of &quot;interface points&quot; for elements which perform the actual communications processing (such as a call processing switch) to be accessed by elements, such as management workstations, to monitor and control them. The standard interface allows elements from different manufacturers to be incorporated into a network under a single management control.

For communication between Operations Systems and NEs (Network Elements), it uses the Common management information protocol (CMIP) or Mediation devices when it uses Q3 interface.

The TMN layered organization is used as fundamental basis for the management software of ISDN, B-ISDN, ATM, SDH/SONET and GSM networks. It is not as commonly used for purely packet-switched data networks.

Modern telecom networks offer automated management functions and are run by operations support system (OSS) software. These manage modern telecom networks and provide the data that is needed in the day-to-day running of a telecom network. OSS software is also responsible for issuing commands to the network infrastructure to activate new service offerings, commence services for new customers, and detect and correct network faults.

== Architecture ==
According to ITU-T M.3010 TMN has 3 architectures:
; Physical architecture : 
; Security architecture : 
; Logical layered architecture :

== Logical layers ==

The framework identifies four logical layers of network management:

; Business management : Includes the functions related to business aspects, analyzes trends and quality issues, for example, or to provide a basis for billing and other financial reports.
; Service management : Handles services in the network: definition, administration and charging of services.
; Network management : Distributes network resources, performs tasks of: configuration, control and supervision of the network.
; Element management : Handles individual network elements including alarm management, handling of information, backup, logging, and maintenance of hardware and software.

A network element provides agent services, mapping the physical aspects of the equipment into the TMN framework.

== Recommendations ==
The TMN M.3000 series includes the following recommendations:

* M.3000 Tutorial Introduction to TMN
* M.3010 Principles for a TMN

<doc id="1003844" wikidata="Q447807" url="?curid=1003844" title="HMS Pathfinder (1904)">
<text>HMS &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was the lead ship of her class of two British scout cruisers, and was the first ship ever to be sunk by a self-propelled torpedo fired by submarine (the American Civil War sloop-of-war USS &quot;Housatonic&quot; had been sunk by a spar torpedo). She was built by Cammell Laird, Birkenhead, launched on 16 July 1904, and commissioned on 18 July 1905. She was originally to have been named HMS &quot;Fastnet&quot;, but was renamed prior to construction. During the beginning of World War I, the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was sunk on 5 September 1914 by a German U-boat, the SM &quot;U-21&quot;.

==Construction==
In May 1902, the British Admiralty issued an invitation to tender to several shipbuilding yards for a new type of small cruiser, intended to act as leaders for flotillas of destroyers. The new ships required high speed to keep up with the destroyers, good seaworthiness and good communications equipment, but as they were only intended to fight destroyer-type vessels, a heavy armament was not specified. The Admiralty produced a broad specification for the ships, normal practice at the time for destroyers, requiring a speed of , a range of , light armour and an armament of ten 12-pounder (3 inch, 76 mm) guns, eight 3-pounder (47mm) guns and two torpedo tubes.

A total of eight scout cruisers were ordered, two each from Armstrong Whitworth, Fairfield, Cammell Laird and Vickers. Cammell Laird&#x27;s ships, the , were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Twelve Normand water-tube boilers fed steam to two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines rated at and driving two shafts. was achieved using forced draft during sea trials, allowing a trial speed of . Range was at . A thick armour belt protected the ship&#x27;s engine rooms, with a armoured deck over the ships engines and an armoured deck of elsewhere, while the ship&#x27;s conning tower was protected with of armour.

The main armament of the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; class consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 18-cwt guns. Three guns were mounted abreast on the forecastle and the quarterdeck, with the remaining four guns positioned port and starboard amidships. They also carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two above-water 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside.

&quot;Pathfinder&quot; was laid down at Cammell Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead shipyard on 15 August 1903, was launched on 16 July 1904 and completed on 18 July 1905.

==Career==
Not long after completion, two additional 12 pounder guns were added and the 3 pounder guns were replaced with six 6 pounder guns. In 1911–12 they were rearmed with nine 4-inch guns. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; spent her early career with the Atlantic Fleet, Channel Fleet (1906) and then the Home Fleet (1907).

In November 1907, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was docked at Chatham Dockyard for inspection of her underwater fittings. On 8 February 1908, the torpedo gunboat collided with the old cruiser in Harwich harbour and was holed, needing to be beached to avoid sinking. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; accompanied &quot;Leda&quot; to Sheerness Dockyard where the gunboat was repaired. In August 1909, &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, now leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla, was under refit at Sheerness.

When the aviator Gustav Hamel&#x27;s aircraft went missing when crossing the English Channel on 23 May 1914, &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, leading the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, took part in unsuccessful search operations for the missing pilot. At the start of the First World War she was part of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla based at Rosyth in the Firth of Forth and commanded by Capt Francis Martin-Leake.

&quot;Pathfinder&quot; was sunk off St. Abbs Head, Berwickshire, Scotland, on Saturday 5 September 1914 by the German &quot;U-21&quot;, commanded by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Otto Hersing. The ship was struck in a magazine, which exploded, causing the ship to sink within minutes with the loss of 259 men.

===Sinking===

At the beginning of September 1914, Otto Hersing, Commanding Officer of &quot;U-21&quot;, ventured to the Firth of Forth, home to the major British naval base at Rosyth. Hersing is known to have penetrated the Firth of Forth as far as the Carlingnose Battery beneath the Forth Bridge. At one point the periscope was spotted and the battery opened fire but without success. Overnight Hersing withdrew from the Forth, patrolling the coast from the Isle of May southwards. On the morning of 5 September, he observed HMS &quot;Pathfinder&quot; on a south-southeast course, followed by elements of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. At midday, the destroyers altered course back towards the Isle of May while &quot;Pathfinder&quot; continued her patrol. Shortly thereafter, Hersing spotted &quot;Pathfinder&quot; on her return journey through his periscope and resolved to make an attack.

At 1543 &quot;U-21&quot; fired a single Type G/6 torpedo at a range of 2,000 yards. At 1545 lookouts spotted a torpedo wake heading towards the starboard bow and the officer of the watch, Lieutenant-Commander Favell, attempted to take evasive action by ordering the starboard engine be put astern and the port engine at full ahead while the wheel was turned hard a port, the manoeuvre was not in time and the torpedo struck the ship beneath the bridge. The detonation apparently set off cordite bags in the forward magazine which caused a second, more massive explosion within the fore section of the ship, essentially destroying everything forward of the bridge. Broken in two, the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; instantly began sinking, dragging most of her crew down with her and leaving a massive pall of smoke to mark her grave. The vessel sank so quickly, in fact, that there was insufficient time to launch lifeboats. (Indeed, the remains of a lifeboat davit and rope can still be seen on the wreck, demonstrating the speed with which the vessel sank.)

One survivor of the sinking, Acting Sub-Lieutenant Edward Oliver Sonnenschein, described the sinking as such:

Also among the survivors was staff surgeon Thomas Aubrey Smyth, who lived at Bedeque House in Dromore, Co Down.

Recounting the experience in a letter to his mother, he said the explosion had blown a &quot;great hole in the side of the ship&quot;.

&quot;I was at the time in the wardroom, but ran up on deck immediately, and it was then evident by the way the bow was down in the water that she would sink rapidly,&quot; he said.

&quot;I was then thrown forward by the slope of the deck and got jammed beneath a gun (which I expect is the cause of my bruising) and while in this position was carried down some way by the sinking ship, but fortunately after a time I became released and after what seemed like interminable ages I came to the surface, and after swimming a short time I was able to get an oar and some other floating material with the help of which I was just able to keep on the surface.&quot;

Fishing boats from the nearby fishing port of Eyemouth were the first on the scene and encountered a field of debris, fuel oil, clothing and body parts. Additionally, the British destroyers HMS &quot;Stag&quot; and &quot;Express&quot; had spotted the smoke and headed for the pall of smoke, only to find that what few survivors there were had already been rescued. (There was an anecdotal story that one of the destroyers had an engine problem when a water inlet was blocked by a leg in a seaboot.)

There is significant confusion regarding the numbers of survivors. On 6 September The Times declared that 58 men had been rescued but that four had died of injuries. The fact that it is impossible to determine how many were on board that day adds to the problem, but modern research indicates that in all probability, there were 268 personnel on board plus two civilian canteen assistants. There were just twenty known survivors.

Four more men died of injuries or exposure and are buried at Dalmeny in Fife and Warriston near Edinburgh. One unknown &quot;Pathfinder&quot; sailor is buried at Dunbar overlooking the scene of the sinking.

The explosion was seen by British writer Aldous Huxley (while staying at Northfield House, St. Abbs) who recorded the following in a letter to his father sent on 14 September 1914:
I dare say Julian told you that we actually saw the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; explosion – a great white cloud with its foot in sea.

The St. Abbs&#x27; lifeboat came in with the most appalling accounts of the scene. There was not a piece of wood, they said, big enough to float a man—and over acres the sea was covered with fragments—human and otherwise. They brought back a sailor&#x27;s cap with half a man&#x27;s head inside it. The explosion must have been frightful. It is thought to be a German submarine that did it, or, possibly, a torpedo fired from one of the refitted German trawlers, which cruise all round painted with British port letters and flying the British flag.
Despite the events of 5 September having been easily visible from shore, the authorities attempted to cover up the fact that &quot;Pathfinder&quot; had been sunk by a torpedo, insisting instead that it had struck a mine. The reason for this is unclear, but probably has to do with the Admiralty&#x27;s position that submarines — a still new and largely untested weapons platform — lacked the capacity to sink a surface warship with a torpedo. A local paper, however, &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, published an eye-witness account by an Eyemouth fisherman, who had assisted in the rescue, that confirmed rumors that a submarine had been responsible. (However &quot;The Scotsman&quot; also reported that &quot;Pathfinder&quot; had been attacked by two U-boats and had accounted for the second one in her death throes. Admiralty intelligence later claimed that cruisers had cornered the U-boat responsible and shelled it to oblivion.) The sinking of &quot;Pathfinder&quot; by a submarine made both sides aware of the potential vulnerability of large ships to attack by submarines.

<text>Lyngbya is a genus of cyanobacteria, unicellular autotrophs that form the basis of the oceanic food chain.

As a result of recent genetic analyses, several new genera were erected from this genus: &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;Moorea&quot;, &quot;Limnoraphis&quot;, &quot;Okeania&quot;, &quot;Microseira&quot;, and &quot;Dapis&quot;.

&quot;Lyngbya&quot; species form long, unbranching filaments inside a rigid mucilaginous sheath. Sheaths may form tangles or mats, intermixed with other phytoplankton species. They reproduce asexually. Their filaments break apart and each cell forms a new filament. The mats grow around atolls, salt marshes, or fresh water.

Some &quot;Lyngbya&quot; species cause the human skin irritation called seaweed dermatitis.

Some &quot;Lyngbya&quot; species can also temporarily monopolize aquatic ecosystems when they form dense, floating mats in the water.

Ingestion of &quot;Lyngbya&quot; is potentially lethal. Most commonly, poisoning is caused by eating fish which have fed on &quot;Lyngbya&quot; or which have fed on other fish which have consumed &quot;Lyngbya&quot;. This is called &quot;ciguatera-like&quot; poisoning.

<text>Marshall Kay (November 10, 1904 – September 4, 1975) was a geologist and professor at Columbia University. He is best known for his studies of the Ordovician of New York, Newfoundland, and Nevada, but his studies were global and he published widely on the stratigraphy of the middle and upper Ordovician. Kay&#x27;s careful fieldwork provided much geological evidence for the theory of continental drift. He was awarded the Penrose Medal in 1971. Less well known is his work for the Manhattan Project, as a geologist searching for manganese deposits. Marshall&#x27;s son Robert Kay of Cornell University, daughter Elizabeth (Kay) Berner of University of Connecticut and son-in-law Robert Berner of Yale University are also geology professors. His son Richard Kay of Duke University is a biological anthropologist and vertebrate paleontologist.

Kay received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1929.

==Uses==
Some species of bents are commonly used for lawn grass. This is a desirable grass for golf course teeing areas, fairways, and greens.

Bentgrass is used in turf applications for its numerous advantages: it can be mowed to a very short length without damage, it can handle a great amount of foot traffic, it has a shallow root system that is thick and dense allowing it to be seeded and grow rather easily, and it has a pleasing, deep green appearance. The name &quot;bent&quot; refers to the shallow roots, which bend just below the surface of the soil to propagate laterally.

===Creeping bent===
&quot;Agrostis stolonifera&quot; is the most commonly used species of &quot;Agrostis&quot;. Historically, it was often called Orcheston long grass, after a village on Salisbury Plain, England. It is cultivated almost exclusively on golf courses, especially on putting greens. Creeping bent aggressively produces horizontal stems, called stolons, that run along the soil&#x27;s surface. These allow creeping bent to form dense stands under conducive conditions and outcompete bunch-type grass and broadleaf weeds. As such, if infested in a home lawn, it can become a troublesome weed problem. The leaves of the bentgrass are long and slender. It can quickly take over a home lawn if it is not controlled and has very shallow roots.

The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and Monsanto genetically engineered creeping bent to be glyphosate-tolerant under Monsanto&#x27;s Roundup Ready trademark, as &quot;one of the first wind-pollinated, perennial, and highly outcrossing transgenic crops&quot;. In 2003, Scotts planted it as part of a large (about 160 ha) field trial in central Oregon near Madras. In 2004, its pollen was found to have reached wild growing bentgrass populations up to 14 kilometres away. Cross-pollinating &quot;Agrostis gigantea&quot; was even found at a distance of 21 kilometres. Scotts could not remove all genetically engineered plants and in 2007, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service fined them $500,000 for non-compliance with Plant Protection Act regulations.

===Common bent===
&quot;Agrostis capillaris&quot;, or colonial bent, was brought to America from Europe. This was the type of grass that was used on the lawns of most estates. It is the tallest of the bents with very fine texture and like most bent grasses grows very densely. Although this species has been used on golf courses and sporting fields it is better suited for lawns. Colonial bent is fairly easy to grow from seeds and fertilization of the lawn is not as intense. This grass also takes longer to establish than creeping bent. However it does not require the intense maintenance.

===Velvet bent===
&quot;Agrostis canina&quot; gets its name for the velvet appearance that this grass produces. It has the finest texture of all the bent grasses. This grass was used in Europe for estate lawns and golf courses because it could be cut so short. Velvet bent grass requires similar upkeep and maintenance to creeping bent. Velvet bent has recently had a resurgence in the UK due to the high demands on greens from inclement weather and speed expectations. This species also has a lighter color than the two previous species.

<doc id="1003870" wikidata="Q473752" url="?curid=1003870" title="Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America">
<text>Hadassah, The Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America is an American Jewish volunteer women&#x27;s organization. Founded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold, it is one of the largest international Jewish organizations, with nearly 300,000 members in the United States. Hadassah fundraises for community programs and health initiatives in Israel, including the Hadassah Medical Organization, two leading research hospitals in Jerusalem. In the US, the organization advocates on behalf of women&#x27;s rights, religious autonomy and US–Israel diplomacy. In Israel, Hadassah supports health education and research, women&#x27;s initiatives, schools and programs for underprivileged youth.
==History==

===Origins===
At a meeting at Temple Emanu-El in New York City on February 24, 1912, Henrietta Szold together with other Zionist women, proposed to the Daughters of Zion study circle that they expand their purpose and embrace proactive work to help meet the health needs of Palestine&#x27;s people. The goal was to promote the Zionist ideal through education, public health initiatives, and the training of nurses in what was then the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire. Because the meeting was held around the time of Purim, the women called themselves &quot;The Hadassah chapter of the Daughters of Zion,&quot; adopting the Hebrew name of Queen Esther. Henrietta Szold became the first president. Within a year, Hadassah had five growing chapters in New York, Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and Boston. Its charter articulates twin goals: to begin public-health initiatives and nurses training in Palestine, and to foster Zionist ideals through education in America.

===The first years: Establishing healthcare in Palestine===
In 1913, Hadassah sent two nurses to Palestine, Rose Kaplan and Rae Landy. They set up a small public health station in Jerusalem to provide maternity care and treat trachoma, a dreaded eye disease rampant in the Middle East. The core of future Hadassah education programs emerged when Jessie Sampter founded The Hadassah School of Zionism in New York in 1915. The school required chapter leaders to take courses, instituted a correspondence course and inspires other Hadassah chapters to create their own Schools of Zionism. Sampter published &quot;A Course in Zionism,&quot; a collection of facts, essays, and reading lists financed by prominent American Zionist, Judge Louis Brandeis.

By 1916, Hadassah established the Palestine Purchasing and Supplies Department (later the Hadassah Supplies Bureau) to buy and ship items unavailable in the yishuv, the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine. Although Hadassah&#x27;s first two nurses were compelled to return to America in 1915, the physicians with whom they had co-operated– Dr. Avraham Ticho and Dr. Helena Kagan – as well as the midwives and probationers were able to carry on their work.

Hadassah established the American Zionist Medical Unit (AZMU) in 1918, which was composed of 45 doctors, nurses, dentists and sanitary engineers. The sole female physician in the group was Sophie Rabinoff. The unit was set up to combat the intolerable health conditions of postwar Palestine and to create permanent health and welfare programs. From the beginning, it established a principle that it would serve all with equal care, regardless of race, creed, ethnicity or nationality. The AZMU helped to establish six hospitals in Palestine which were then turned over to municipal authorities. Led by Alice Seligsberg, the unit sailed for Palestine in June, bringing desperately needed drugs, medical instruments and supplies, linen and clothing. That year, Hadassah also founded a nursing school to train local personnel and create a cadre of nurses. Over the next few years, the unit, based in the old Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem, initiated American-style health and welfare programs with intensive campaigns to wipe out malaria, cholera, trachoma and scalp diseases in many Jewish communities in the yishuv. The unit organized a sanitation program and founded Hadassah hospitals in Jaffa, Tiberias, and Safed, as well as opened the Nurses Training School at the Rothschild Hospital in Jerusalem. The first 22 young women graduated from Hadassah&#x27;s Nurses&#x27; Training School in 1921. In 1924, the unit&#x27;s name is changed to Hadassah Medical Organization.

In 1919, Hadassah organized the first School Hygiene Department in Palestine to give routine health examinations to Jerusalem school children. During the Arab riots of 1920, Hadassah nurses cared for the wounded on both sides. Henrietta Szold also moved to Jerusalem that year to develop community health and preventive care programs. Back in New York in 1920, Alice Seligsberg formed Junior Hadassah, which provided innovative programs for young women who wanted to participate in Hadassah&#x27;s Zionist mission. In the same year, Henrietta Szold moved to Palestine to lead the medical work started by the unit. She remained based in Jerusalem until her death in 1945.

In 1921, Hadassah nurse Bertha Landsman created Palestine&#x27;s first permanent infant welfare station, Tipat Halav (Drop of Milk), in Jerusalem. The overwhelming success inspired Hadassah to expand the program, delivering fresh milk to needy families by &quot;donkey express.&quot; Hadassah also opened a hospital in Tel Aviv, the city&#x27;s first hospital. Under Hadassah&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;devolution,&quot; it initiated and developed a number of facilities and projects and then transferred them to the appropriate municipalities. Hadassah transferred administration of this hospital to the Tel Aviv municipality in 1931.

1923: Hadassah instituted a school lunch program to teach nutrition and serve healthy meals to children and teenagers in Palestine. Pennies are collected by American Hebrew school students to fund this project, which is devolved to the Israeli government in 1950, with Hadassah&#x27;s support ending in 1954.

1924: Nathan Straus contributed $10,000 with which Hadassah develops its Infant Welfare Stations into a complete network, extending from Jerusalem to Tiberias. Pamphlets were distributed to all Hadassah chapters for five cents each.

1925: Junior Hadassah assumed sole support of the Meir Shfeyah Children&#x27;s Village, a youth village housing World War I orphans and socially disadvantaged children (devolved to the Israel Ministry of Agriculture in 1953, with Hadassah continuing limited financial support).

1926: Hadassah forms a partnership with the Jewish National Fund (JNF), also known as Keren Keyemeth LeYisrael (KKL), an organization established in 1901 by the Fifth World Zionist Congress to purchase and transform land in Palestine for Jewish farming, housing, roads, and recreation. JNF became, and has remained, a major Hadassah project in Israel. Hadassah opens Palestine&#x27;s first tuberculosis ward in its Safed hospital, which becomes the region&#x27;s tuberculosis center in 1935 (devolved to the Israeli government in 1957).

1927: The cornerstone is laid at a solemn ceremony for the Nathan and Lina Straus Health Center in Jerusalem, conceived as a model for future health centers in Palestine, with funding from Nathan Straus. According to Dr. E. M. Bluestone, then Director of the Hadassah Medical Organization, this center would serve as the headquarters of the Health Welfare Department of the Hadassah Medical Organization, with space devoted to new health activities. Through the decades many preventive health programs were housed in this building - a dental clinic, children&#x27;s exercise programs, and Nathan Straus&#x27; milk pasteurization plant among others.

1928: Hadassah&#x27;s urban recreational activities program begins with the supervision of the Guggenheimer Playgrounds, with funds from the estate of Bertha V. Guggenheimer. By 1950, when the playgrounds were devolved to the Israel Government&#x27;s Department of Education, the program had grown to fifty playgrounds throughout the country where urban children had a safe, sanitary place to play.

1929: Hadassah Medical Organization (HMO) opens the Nathan and Lina Straus Health Center to serve Jerusalem&#x27;s growing population, made possible by a large gift from the Straus family. (Operates today as an outpatient facility in downtown Jerusalem)

===Youth Aliyah===

The research team is headed by Prof. Benjamin Reubinoff, director of Hadassah&#x27;s Center for Human Embryonic Stem Cell research at the Goldyne Savad Institute of Gene Therapy and the Department of Gynecology, and Prof. Tamir Ben-Hur, senior physician in Hadassah&#x27;s department of Neurology, the Agnes Ginges Center for Human Neurogenetics. The research was funded in part by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke (NINDS), a component of the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States.

2005: Hadassah dedicates its newest facility, the Judy and Sidney Swartz Center for Emergency Medicine at Ein Kerem. The $50 million center has the capacity to treat 100,000 to 120,000 patients annually, an increase of 41 percent above previous use, and includes an expanded trauma and resuscitation unit, an acute and critical care facility, adult and pediatric emergency units, and an observation unit.

In 2005, the two Jerusalem hospitals of the Hadassah Medical Organization were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing areas in which they promoted peace:
* Maintaining equal treatment for all regardless of religion, ethnicity and nationality
* Setting an example of cooperation and coexistence by maintaining a mixed staff of people of all faiths
* Initiatives to create bridges for peace, even during periods of active conflict between Israel and one or more of its neighbors

2006: Hadassah staff from the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem volunteer to travel the 112 miles north to Katyusha-struck Nahariya every weekday during the missile bombardment during the summer. They travel in teams composed of a physician (usually an internist), a child psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, a social worker and a medical clown, clad in helmets and bullet-proof vests, moving through the town from shelter to shelter, reaching out to Nahariya&#x27;s traumatized residents.

====Henrietta Szold&#x27;s induction into National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame====
2007: Henrietta Szold, founder of Hadassah, is inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, NY, the birthplace of the American women&#x27;s movement. As Young Judaea&#x27;s Year Course in Israel celebrates its fiftieth year, a new Year Course track includes travel to and study about four extraordinary communities with deep-rooted connections to the Jewish people – Marranos in Portugal, the Lemba of Southern Africa, Bene Israel and Bnei Menashe communities in India, and the Abayudaya Jews of Uganda. Hadassah receives a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, an independent charity evaluator, highly regarded in the philanthropic world for its data-driven analysis that rates charitable organizations on their ability to efficiently manage and grow the organization&#x27;s finances. Inspired by its historical imperative to continue building the medical infrastructure of Jerusalem, Hadassah raises the first $164 million needed to begin construction of the new Sarah Wetsman Davidson Hospital Tower on the campus of Hadassah Hospital in Ein Kerem.

2008: Nancy Falchuk, National President of Hadassah, is part of the Bush Delegation celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the State of Israel. Research at HMO shows that transplantation of human embryonic stem cells into the brains of mice with multiple sclerosis (MS) significantly slows the clinical symptoms and pathological manifestations of the disease.

2012: Hadassah celebrated its centennial in Jerusalem. Hadassah opened the Sarah Wetsman Davidson Hospital Tower, a 500 bed-facility with 20 operating theaters, as well as five below-ground floors for protection from terrorist attacks.

==Other ventures==
=== Jewish National Fund ===
The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1901 by Theodor Herzl to secure ownership of land in Palestine for the Jewish people from the Ottoman Empire. This land, the majority of which was uncultivated, was reclaimed to create collective worker&#x27;s communities that could sustain themselves through agricultural means. As the Jewish National Fund&#x27;s funding grew, so did their involvement in other facets of cultural improvement, such as creating major city structures, financing the expenses of Jewish scientists, and founding institutions of higher education. Hadassah&#x27;s partnership with JNF in the 1920s aided in the continuation of like-minded efforts including meeting an additional JNF pledge to replace 100,000 trees destroyed by arson in 1990, a pledge to provide JNF recreational facilities in a Galilee development plan, and allocating $3 million to make JNF&#x27;s American Independence Park Israel&#x27;s first completely handicapped-accessible park, among others. Memorial trees and forests are still purchased in individual&#x27;s honors and given as gifts for major events.

===International programs===
Established in 1983 by National President Bernice Tannenbaum, Hadassah International is a network of volunteers, including men and women of many faiths and nationalities. 
Hadassah International does work on every continent save Antarctica.
Young Hadassah International is Hadassah International&#x27;s branch for 18- to 35-year-olds, active in Germany, Australia, Mexico and the United Kingdom, among others.

===Hadassah Magazine===

&quot;Hadassah Magazine&quot; is a bimonthly magazine published out of Hadassah, WZOA&#x27;s headquarters in Manhattan, covering news, politics and cultural topics, primarily for Jewish female audience. It has been in circulation since 1914, and in 1986 had 385,000 paid subscribers to its printed edition. The magazine gained additional readers in the early 2000s when it added its free online edition, though the move also brought a decline in the printed edition readership. The paid print circulation is now estimated at over 250,000.

&quot;Hadassah Magazine&quot; received more than 350 awards for editorial excellence, including a National Magazine Award nomination in 1993, and multiple Simon Rockower Awards.

The magazine was a pioneer in the ban on cigarette advertising &quot;in keeping with the mission and philosophy of the organization&quot;

==Madoff scandal==
Hadassah invested some $40 million with Bernard Madoff Securities, beginning in 1988 with a $7 million gift from a French donor and adding $33 million over the following eight years. The investment initially proved quite profitable: through April 2007, Hadassah withdrew a total of $137 million.

Hadassah&#x27;s balance of $90 million evaporated in December 2008, when the fund was revealed as a Ponzi scheme. Moreover, because Hadassah had profited from Madoff&#x27;s scheme, it was targeted for &quot;clawback&quot; efforts by the trustee representing Madoff victims who lost money. After several months of negotiations, Hadassah agreed to contribute $45 million to a fund for Madoff&#x27;s victims.

After testifying at Madoff&#x27;s sentencing hearing and urging a long prison sentence for the disgraced financier, Hadassah&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer, Sheryl Weinstein acknowledged a 20-year long adulterous affair with Madoff, during which period Hadassah had been investing heavily with him. As a result, the Young Judaea movement, which was previously solely funded by Hadassah lost millions in funding. The Young Judaea movement became independent of Hadassah in 2011.

<text>Kelly Crawford Perdew (born January 29, 1967) is an American businessman and winner of &quot;The Apprentice 2&quot;.

== Before &quot;The Apprentice&quot; ==
Perdew was born in Lexington, Kentucky and was raised in Florida and Wyoming. Prior to winning &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, he was president of CoreObjects, a software development outsourcing company based in Los Angeles.

Perdew attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in national security and public affairs in 1989, graduating as the number one ranked cadet in his field of study and in the top 5% of his overall class.

While at West Point, Perdew attended Ranger and Airborne training. In addition to his regular studies at West Point, Perdew interned with the House Armed Services Committee, spent a semester on &quot;exchange&quot; at the Naval Academy, and was a Rhodes Scholar finalist. He served in the United States Army as a military intelligence officer for three years.

After his honorable discharge as a First Lieutenant, Perdew attended graduate schools at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), earning a joint JD/MBA degree from the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA Anderson School of Management, respectively, in 1995. He chose not to practice law after graduation, although during law school he worked part-time at the firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.

== During the show ==
Perdew was 37 when participating in &quot;The Apprentice 2&quot; and was the oldest candidate on the show. He was eventually chosen by Donald Trump to be his apprentice, nominally managing the construction of Trump Place located in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York while promoting it in reality. It was also revealed in &quot;The Apprentice 3&quot; finale that Perdew was an executive vice-president for Trump&#x27;s brand of bottled water, Trump Ice.

== Current career ==

Perdew is the Managing Partner for Moonshots Capital – an early-stage angel syndicate. He has personally invested in over 30 early-stage technology companies and acted as a board member or advisor to many including LinkedIn and Pandora. He is the founder &amp; CEO at TargetClose. Prior to founding TargetClose, he was the CEO of Fastpoint Games, a venture-backed leading developer of live data-driven games for the fortune 500 brand set. Fastpoint Games sold to WePlay in December 2011.

Prior to Fastpoint Games, he was President of ProElite.com, a social networking site for mixed martial arts. He was also the President of eTeamz with founder Brian Johnson that is now a part of Active Network, LLC and serving over 3 million amateur sports teams.

Perdew filmed nine episodes of a show called &quot;G.I Factory&quot; on the Military Channel, which did not get picked up for a second series. He has also done a commercial titled &quot;Today&#x27;s Military&quot; with Donald Trump, involving him accepting a &quot;military challenge&quot; from Trump. Perdew is also the author of &quot;Take Command: 10 Leadership Principles Learned in the Military And Put To Work For Donald Trump&quot; () The book focuses on leadership principles that are necessary for success in business and life and includes interviews with business/military icons such as Ross Perot, Bill Coleman and Roger Staubach.

Perdew founded a company called American Family Protection, Inc. to provide government-approved training modules to U.S. families on how to respond to a terrorist attack. The interactive CD is called the Terrorist Attack Survival Kit.

In June 2006, Perdew received a Presidential Appointment from President George W. Bush to the Council on Service and Civic Participation.

He currently serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military service organization.

<text>Christopher Michael Russo (born October 18, 1959), also known as &quot;Mad Dog&quot;, is an American sports radio personality best known as the former co-host of the &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; sports radio program with Mike Francesa, which was broadcast on WFAN in New York City and simulcasted on the YES Network. Russo joined Sirius XM Radio in August 2008 and operates his own channel, Mad Dog Sports Radio. He also hosts an afternoon radio show, &quot;Mad Dog Unleashed&quot;, SiriusXM Ch. 82 Mad Dog Sports Radio. Russo also joined MLB Network on March 31, 2014 and hosted his own show, &quot;High Heat&quot;, until 2024. He also frequently appears on ESPN’s &quot;First Take&quot;. Russo was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame on November 1, 2022.

==Background==
Russo was born in Syosset, New York on Long Island. He went to Darrow School in New Lebanon, New York, and Rollins College near Orlando, Florida graduating with a degree in history. He also spent one spring at the Cranleigh School south of London, England (Russo&#x27;s mother is English) and one semester at the University of Sydney in Australia studying Australian history and literature.

Prior to joining WFAN, Russo worked for WKIS in Orlando between 1984 and 1987 and WMCA in New York City between 1987 and 1988. During his career at WKIS, when it became clear that the people of Central Florida were having difficulty understanding his accent, the station sent him to speech therapy twice a week. He received the &quot;Mad Dog&quot; nickname from &quot;New York Daily News&quot; sports media critic Bob Raissman, who said Russo&#x27;s approach to radio reminded him of former professional wrestler Maurice Vachon, who was also known as &quot;Mad Dog.&quot;

Russo is known for his quick manner of speaking, his whistles, and his trademark greeting of &quot;Good afternoon everybody!&quot; at the start of the &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; show. George Vecsey of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described his voice as &quot;a bizarre mixture of Jerry Lewis, Archie Bunker and Daffy Duck.&quot; Russo&#x27;s voice was also described as &quot;Donald Duck on steroids&quot; by Don Imus.

==Career==
===&quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot;===

Russo joined WFAN in December 1988 as an overnight, weekend, and fill-in host. Former WFAN Morning Show Host Don Imus brought Russo on board the &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; show as the sports reporter. Imus also later helped promote Russo&#x27;s nickname. By early 1989, his work on Imus led to Russo getting his own regular weekend show on Saturday Mornings. When Pete Franklin&#x27;s drive time Show from 3 pm to 7 pm was not renewed by WFAN station management, WFAN paired up Russo with Mike Francesa, who at the time was a co-host on the mid-morning show. The show was dubbed &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; and officially launched on September 5, 1989, at 3 PM Eastern Time.

On August 14, 2008, Russo reached a mutual agreement with WFAN to release him out of the remainder of his contract. Russo insisted it was solely a personal decision and said, &quot;This has nothing to do with Mike and I hating each other... This is about doing something different. I&#x27;m 48 years old and there are not going to be too many more opportunities to break away. It&#x27;s time to try something else, but it was a tough decision to make.&quot; On August 15, 2008, Russo phoned Francesa on the show to say an emotional goodbye.

On October 16, 2009, Russo joined Francesa for a one-hour reunion show at Yankee Stadium, where both were scheduled to broadcast in adjacent booths. Francesa joined Russo on his Sirius XM show later in the day.

On March 30, 2016, Russo joined Francesa for a &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot; reunion at Radio City Music Hall.

===&quot;Mad Dog Unleashed&quot;===
On August 19, 2008, Russo signed a five-year contract with Sirius XM Radio to headline a new sports talk channel called Mad Dog Radio on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. Russo hosts the channel&#x27;s anchor program, &quot;Mad Dog Unleashed&quot;, live from Sirius&#x27;s New York studios every weekday afternoon. Russo brought aboard long-time WINS anchor Steve Torre as the new program director of &quot;Mad Dog Radio&quot; and hired Bill Zimmerman (known on the air as &quot;Billy Z&quot;) as the executive producer of his show. The show began airing daily on Sirius Channel 123 and XM Channel 144 on September 15, 2008. The show now airs on Sirius and XM Channel 82.

Russo said there was nothing WFAN could have done to keep him, after Sirius XM provided him his own channel, hosting American sports talk personalities. Russo&#x27;s 5-year deal was worth approximately $3 million per year and Russo operates the channel himself, and hires the on-air staff.

On July 9, 2009, Russo reacted to his station being ranked outside the Top 100 stations on satellite radio by berating his entire staff, which included bringing on nighttime host Andy Gresh for an in-person dress-down. Russo concluded by firing his program director, Steve Torre. Torre was later re-hired and it is unknown if the incident was legitimate or a radio skit. On August 28, 2013, Russo announced that he had been signed by Sirius XM for three more years, commencing in September 2013.

Following Game 5 of the 2023 National League Championship Series with the Philadelphia Phillies leading the series 3–2, Russo predicted a Phillies&#x27; win on Mad Dog Radio and said that he would retire if the Arizona Diamondbacks won two consecutive games at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia to advance to the World Series. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo, who said he is a friend of Russo, said that he &quot;would love to see him quit&quot; if the Diamondbacks won. Russo&#x27;s promise reportedly caused a surge in support for the Diamondbacks among social media users. The day after the Diamondbacks defeated the Phillies in Game 7 to advance to the World Series, Russo appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and reneged on his retirement vow, instead agreeing to walk around New York City wearing a Diamondbacks-themed bikini and a self-deprecating sign at the suggestion of Stern.

===&quot;High Heat&quot;===
Russo&#x27;s Sirius XM deal also included daily hosting of an MLB Network TV show, &quot;High Heat&quot;, which began on March 31, 2014 and simulcasts on the MLB Network Radio channel of Sirius XM. He signed a new three-year contract, in September 2016. Russo renewed his contract for four more years, in April 2019. On February 15, 2021, Russo announced that the show&#x27;s producer Bruce Schein, who appeared daily on-air, had been let go by MLB Network. After the 2024 MLB season, the show was cancelled by the network.

==Personal life==
Russo is the only child of Anthony Michael &quot;Tony&quot; (1931–2013) and Vera &quot;Molly&quot; Russo, from Flushing, Queens and England, respectively. Russo married Jeanne Lavelle on May 6, 1995, and they have four children, Timmy, Kiera, Colin, and Patrick. Colin made his radio debut in his father&#x27;s old time slot on WFAN on December 30, 2020, cohosting with Sonny Carton, son of long-time host, Craig Carton. Russo resides in New Canaan, Connecticut and is a lifelong, avid San Francisco Giants fan.

<doc id="1003888" wikidata="Q745110" url="?curid=1003888" title="Battle of Chaldiran">
<text>The Battle of Chaldiran (; ) took place on 23 August 1514 and ended with a decisive victory for the Ottoman Empire over the Safavid Empire. As a result, the Ottomans annexed Eastern Anatolia and Upper Mesopotamia from Safavid Iran. It marked the first Ottoman expansion into Eastern Anatolia, and the halt of the Safavid expansion to the west. The Battle of Chaldiran was just the beginning of 41 years of destructive war, which only ended in 1555 with the Peace of Amasya. Though the Safavids eventually reconquered Mesopotamia and Eastern Anatolia under the reign of Abbas the Great (r. 1588–1629), they would be permanently ceded to the Ottomans by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab.

At Chaldiran, the Ottomans had a larger, better-equipped army numbering 60,000 to 100,000 and many heavy artillery pieces. In contrast, the Safavid army numbered 40,000 to 80,000 and did not have artillery. Ismail I, the leader of the Safavids, was wounded and almost captured during the battle. His wives were captured by the Ottoman leader Selim I, with at least one married off to one of Selim&#x27;s statesmen. Ismail retired to his palace and withdrew from government administration after this defeat and never again participated in a military campaign. After their victory, Ottoman forces marched deeper into Persia, briefly occupying the Safavid capital, Tabriz, and thoroughly looting the Persian imperial treasury.

The battle is one of major historical importance because it not only negated the idea that the murshid of the Qizilbash was infallible, but also led Kurdish chiefs to assert their authority and switch their allegiance from the Safavids to the Ottomans.

== Background ==

After Selim I&#x27;s successful struggle against his brothers for the throne of the Ottoman Empire, he was free to turn his attention to the internal unrest he believed was stirred up by the Qizilbash, a Twelver Shi&#x27;i warrior-dervish group who had sided with other members of the dynasty against him and had been semi-officially supported by Bayezid II. Selim now feared that they would incite the population against his rule in favor of their leader, who was now the Safavid emperor. His partisans believed he was descended from Muhammad and infallible. Selim secured a jurist opinion that described Isma&#x27;il and the Qizilbash as &quot;unbelievers and heretics,&quot; enabling him to undertake extreme measures on his way eastward to pacify the country. Selim accused Ismail of departing from the faith:
Before Selim started his campaign, he ordered the execution of some 40,000 Qizilbash in Anatolia &quot;as punishment for their rebellious behaviour.&quot; He then also tried to block the import of Iranian silk into his realm, a measure which met &quot;with some success&quot;.

Selim sent the following letter to Ismail, which outlined both Selim&#x27;s claim to the caliphate and Ismail&#x27;s heresy:
When Selim started his march east, the Khanate of Bukhara invaded the Safavids in the east. This Uzbek state had been recently brought to prominence by Muhammad Shaybani, who had fallen in battle against Isma&#x27;il only a few years before. Attempting to avoid having to fight a war on two fronts, Isma&#x27;il employed a scorched earth policy against Selim in the west.

Selim&#x27;s army was discontented by the difficulty in supplying the army in light of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s scorched earth campaign, the extremely rough terrain of the Armenian highlands, and that they were marching against Muslims. The janissaries even fired their muskets at the Sultan&#x27;s tent in protest at one point. When Selim learned of the Safavid army forming at Chaldiran, he quickly moved to engage Isma&#x27;il, partly to stifle his army&#x27;s discontent.

==Battle==
The Ottomans deployed heavy artillery and thousands of Janissaries equipped with gunpowder weapons behind a barrier of carts. The Safavids, who did not have artillery at their disposal at Chaldiran, used cavalry to engage the Ottoman forces. The Safavids attacked the Ottoman wings to avoid the Ottoman artillery positioned at the center. However, the Ottoman artillery was highly maneuverable and the Safavids suffered disastrous losses. The advanced Ottoman weaponry (cannons and muskets wielded by janissaries) was the deciding factor of the battle as the Safavid forces, who only had traditional weaponry, were decimated. Unlike the Ottomans, the Safavids also suffered from poor planning and ill-disciplined troops.

==Aftermath==

Following their victory, the Ottomans captured the Safavid capital city of Tabriz on 7 September, which they first pillaged and then evacuated. That week&#x27;s Friday sermon in mosques throughout the city was delivered in Selim&#x27;s name. Selim was however unable to press on after Tabriz due to the discontent amongst the janissaries. The Ottoman Empire successfully annexed Eastern Anatolia (encompassing Western Armenia) and Upper Mesopotamia from the Safavids. These areas changed hands several times over the following decades; however, the Ottoman hold would not be set until the 1555 Peace of Amasya following the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555). Effective governmental rule and eyalets would not be established over these regions until the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab.

After two of his wives and entire harem were captured by Selim Ismail was heartbroken and resorted to drinking alcohol. His aura of invincibility shattered, Ismail ceased participating in government and military affairs, due to what seems to have been the collapse of his confidence.

Selim married one of Ismail&#x27;s wives to an Ottoman judge. In contrast to their previous exchanges, Ismail sent four envoys, gifts, and, in contrast to their previous exchanges, words of praise to Selim to help retrieve her. Instead of giving his wife back, Selim cut the messengers&#x27; noses off and sent them back empty-handed.

After the defeat at Chaldiran, however, the Safavids made drastic domestic changes. From then on, firearms were made an integral part of the Persian armies, and Ismail&#x27;s son, Tahmasp I, deployed cannons in subsequent battles.

During the retreat of the Ottoman troops, they were intensively harassed by Georgian light cavalry of the Safavid army, deep into the Ottoman realm.

The Mamluk Sultanate refused to send messengers to congratulate Selim after the battle and prohibited celebrating the Ottoman military victory. In contrast, the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople led to days of festivities in the Mamluk capital, Cairo.

After the victorious battle of Chaldiran, Selim I next threw his forces southward in the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517).

== Battlefield ==

The site of the battle is near Gal Ashaqi, a village around 6 km west of the town of Siah Cheshmeh, south of Maku, north of Qarah Zia ol Din. A large brick dome was built at the battlefield site in 2003 along with a statue of Seyid Sadraddin, one of the main Safavid commanders.

<text>Juncus is a genus of monocotyledonous flowering plants, commonly known as rushes. It is the largest genus in the family Juncaceae, containing around 300 species.

==Description==
Rushes of the genus &quot;Juncus&quot; are herbaceous plants that superficially resemble grasses or sedges. They have historically received little attention from botanists; in his 1819 monograph, James Ebenezer Bicheno described the genus as &quot;obscure and uninviting&quot;.

The form of the flower differentiates rushes from grasses or sedges. The flowers of &quot;Juncus&quot; comprise five whorls of floral parts: three sepals, three petals (or, taken together, six tepals), two to six stamens (in two whorls) and a stigma with three lobes. The stems are round in cross-section, unlike those of sedges, which are typically somewhat triangular in cross-section.

In &quot;Juncus&quot; section &quot;Juncotypus&quot; (formerly called &quot;Juncus&quot; subg. &quot;Genuini&quot;), which contains some of the most widespread and familiar species, the leaves are reduced to sheaths around the base of the stem and the bract subtending the inflorescence closely resembles a continuation of the stem, giving the appearance that the inflorescence is lateral.

==Distribution and ecology==
&quot;Juncus&quot; has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species found throughout the world, with the exception of Antarctica. They typically grow in cold or wet habitats, and in the tropics, are most common in montane environments.

==Fossil record==
Several fossil fruits of a &quot;Juncus&quot; species have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

==Classification==

The genus &quot;Juncus&quot; was first named by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 &quot;&quot;. The type species of the genus was designated by Frederick Vernon Coville, who in 1913 chose the first species in Linnaeus&#x27; account, &quot;Juncus acutus&quot;. &quot;Juncus&quot; can be divided into two major groups, one group with cymose inflorescences that include bracteoles, and one with racemose inflorescences with no bracteoles.

The genus is divided into the following subgenera and sections:
* &quot;Juncus&quot; subg. &quot;Juncus&quot;
** sect. &quot;Juncus&quot;
** sect. &quot;Graminei&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Caespitosi&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Stygiopsis&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Ozophyllum&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Iridifolii&quot; 
* &quot;Juncus&quot; subg. &quot;Poiophylli&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Tenageia&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Steirochloa&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Juncotypus&quot; 
** sect. &quot;Forskalina&quot;

<text>Bothrops lanceolatus — known as the fer-de-lance, Martinican pit viper, and Martinique lancehead — is a species of pit viper endemic to the Caribbean island of Martinique. Some reserve the common name &quot;fer-de-lance&quot; for this species, while others apply that name to other &quot;Bothrops&quot; species, as well. No subspecies are currently recognized.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Bothrops lanceolatus&quot; is generally considered endemic to the island of Martinique in the Lesser Antilles. Along with &quot;Bothrops caribbaeus&quot; and &quot;B. atrox&quot;, it is one of three &quot;Bothrops&quot; species found in the West Indies. The type locality according to Bonnaterre (1790:11) is &quot;La Martinique&quot;.

==Description==
It measures 1.50 to 2 m (5 feet) long. Its color is brown, black and gray.

==Behavior==
As ambush predators, Martinique lanceheads typically wait patiently somewhere for unsuspecting prey to wander by.They are known to select a specific ambush site and return to it every year in time for the spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated these snakes learn to improve their strike accuracy over time.

===Diet===
All of the various species are carnivorous, and eat other animals. Their diet primarily changes based on size and location. Larger individuals can feed on larger prey, while smaller species must eat smaller prey items. Martinican pit vipers hunt rats, mice, birds, rabbits, lizards, frogs, snakes, bats, and more.

===Reproduction===
With few exceptions, crotalines are ovoviviparous, meaning that the embryos develop within eggs that remain inside the mother&#x27;s body until the offspring are ready to hatch, at which time the hatchlings emerge as functionally free-living young. In such species, the eggshells are reduced to soft membranes that the young shed, either within the reproductive tract, or immediately after emerging.

==Venom==
Their venom has toxins that can cause clotting and bleeding in humans, as well as muscle damage and swelling.

==Vexillological trivia==
The species is depicted on the unofficial flag of Martinique, one of the few examples (the Gadsden flag and the First Navy Jack of the United States, and the flag of Mexico being others) of snakes being depicted on flags.

<text>Luzula is a genus of flowering plants in the rush family Juncaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring throughout the world, especially in temperate regions, the Arctic, and higher elevation areas in the tropics. Plants of the genus are known commonly as wood-rush, wood rush, or woodrush. Possible origins of the genus name include the Italian &quot;lucciola&quot; (&quot;to shine, sparkle&quot;) or the Latin &quot;luzulae&quot; or &quot;luxulae&quot;, from &quot;lux&quot; (&quot;light&quot;), inspired by the way the plants sparkle when wet with dew. Another etymology sometimes given is that it does derive from &quot;lucciola&quot; but that this meant a mid-summer field, or from the Latin &quot;luculus&quot;, meaning a small place; the same source also states that this name was applied by Luigi Anguillara (an Italian botanist) in 1561.

These rushes are usually perennial plants with rhizomes and sometimes stolons. They generally form clumps of cylindrical stems and narrow leaves with hair-lined edges. The inflorescence is often a dense cluster of flowers with two leaf-like bracts at the base, or sometimes a solitary flower or a few flowers borne together. They have six brownish tepals.

&quot;Luzula&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the smoky wainscot. Several moths of the genus &quot;Coleophora&quot; have been observed on the plants. &quot;Coleophora biforis&quot; and &quot;C. otidipennella&quot; feed exclusively on &quot;Luzula&quot;. &quot;C. antennariella&quot; is limited to &quot;Luzula pilosa&quot;, and &quot;C. sylvaticella&quot; feeds only on &quot;L. sylvatica&quot;.

Some species, notably &quot;Luzula sylvatica&quot; and its cultivars, are used as ornamental garden plants.

<doc id="1003907" wikidata="Q978987" url="?curid=1003907" title="The Burghers of Calais">
<text>The Burghers of Calais () is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin in 12 original castings and numerous copies. It commemorates an event during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, when Calais, a French port on the English Channel, surrendered to the English after an 11-month siege. The city commissioned Rodin to create the sculpture in 1884 and the work was completed in 1889.

==History==
In 1346, England&#x27;s Edward III, after victory in the Battle of Crécy, laid siege to Calais, while Philip VI of France ordered the city to hold out at all costs. Philip failed to lift the siege, and starvation eventually forced the city to parley for surrender.

The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart (c. 1337 – c. 1405) tells a story of what happened next: Edward offered to spare the people of the city if six of its leaders would surrender themselves to him, presumably to be executed. Edward demanded they walk out wearing nooses around their necks, and carrying the keys to the city and castle. One of the wealthiest of the town leaders, Eustache de Saint Pierre, volunteered first, and five other burghers joined with him. Saint Pierre led this envoy of volunteers to the city gates. It was this moment, and this poignant mix of defeat, heroic self-sacrifice, and willingness to face imminent death which Rodin captured in his sculpture, scaled somewhat larger than life.

According to Froissart&#x27;s story, the burghers expected to be executed, but their lives were spared by the intervention of England&#x27;s queen, Philippa of Hainault, who persuaded her husband to exercise mercy by claiming their deaths would be a bad omen for her unborn child.

==Composition==
The City of Calais had attempted to erect a statue of Eustache de Saint Pierre, eldest of the burghers, since 1845. Two prior artists were prevented from creating the sculpture: David d&#x27;Angers by his death, and Auguste Clésinger by the Franco-Prussian War. In 1884 the municipal corporation of the city invited several artists, Rodin amongst them, to submit proposals for the project.

Rodin&#x27;s design, which included all six figures rather than just de Saint Pierre, was controversial. The public felt that it lacked &quot;overtly heroic antique references&quot; which were considered integral to public sculpture. It was not a pyramidal arrangement and contained no allegorical figures. It was intended to be placed at ground level, rather than on a pedestal. The burghers were not presented in a positive image of glory; instead, they display &quot;pain, anguish and fatalism&quot;. To Rodin, this was nevertheless heroic, the heroism of self-sacrifice.

In 1895 the monument was installed in Calais on a large pedestal in front of Parc Richelieu, a public park, contrary to the sculptor&#x27;s wishes, who wanted contemporary townsfolk to &quot;almost bump into&quot; the figures and feel solidarity with them. Only later was his vision realised, when the sculpture was moved in front of the newly completed town hall of Calais, where it now rests on a much lower base.

==Depicted persons==
The six burghers depicted are:
* Eustache de Saint Pierre
* Jacques de Wissant
* Pierre de Wissant
* Jean de Fiennes
* Andrieu d&#x27;Andres
* Jean d&#x27;Aire

and
* Plateau (formerly called &quot;Rodin Gallery&quot; and closed since 2016) in Seoul. This is the twelfth and final original cast and was cast in 1995.


Copies of individual statues are:
* sculptures of all individual figures on the campus of Stanford University;
* sculptures of all individual figures (casts from 1984 till 1988) and the First Maquette of the Burghers of Calais, cast 1987, in the Shizuoka Prefectural Museum of Art, Shizuoka City, Japan;

<doc id="1003908" wikidata="Q848915" url="?curid=1003908" title="Double Concerto (Brahms)">
<text>The Double Concerto in A minor, Op. 102, by Johannes Brahms is a concerto for violin, cello and orchestra, composed in 1887 as his last work for orchestra.

== Origin of the work ==
The Double Concerto was Brahms&#x27; final work for orchestra. It was composed in the summer of 1887, and first performed on 18 October of that year in the in Cologne, Germany. Brahms approached the project with anxiety over writing for instruments that were not his own. He wrote it for the cellist Robert Hausmann, a frequent chamber music collaborator, and his old but estranged friend, the violinist Joseph Joachim. The concerto was, in part, a gesture of reconciliation towards Joachim, after their long friendship had ruptured following Joachim&#x27;s divorce from his wife Amalie. (Brahms had sided with Amalie in the dispute.)

The concerto makes use of the musical motif A–E–F, a permutation of F–A–E, which stood for a personal motto of Joachim, &quot;Frei aber einsam&quot; (&quot;free but lonely&quot;). Thirty-four years earlier, Brahms had been involved in a collaborative work using the F-A-E motif in tribute to Joachim: the F-A-E Sonata of 1853.

== Structure ==
The composition consists of three movements in the fast–slow–fast pattern typical of classical instrumental concerti:
== Scoring ==
The orchestra consists of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings.

== Performance and reception ==
Joachim and Hausmann performed the concerto, with Brahms at the podium, several times in its initial 1887–88 season, and Brahms gave the manuscript to Joachim, with the inscription &quot;To him for whom it was written.&quot; Clara Schumann reacted unfavourably to the concerto, considering the work &quot;not brilliant for the instruments&quot;. Richard Specht also thought critically of the concerto, describing it as &quot;one of Brahms&#x27; most inapproachable and joyless compositions&quot;. Brahms had sketched a second concerto for violin and cello but destroyed his notes in the wake of its cold reception. Later critics have warmed to it: Donald Tovey wrote of the concerto as having &quot;vast and sweeping humour&quot;. Its performance requires two brilliant and equally matched soloists.

== Scholarly discussion ==
Richard Cohn has included the first movement of this concerto in his discussions of triadic progressions from a Neo-Riemannian perspective. Cohn has also analysed such progressions mathematically. Cohn notes several progressions that divide the octave equally into three parts, and which can be analyzed using the triadic transformations proposed by Hugo Riemann.

<doc id="1003913" wikidata="Q272305" url="?curid=1003913" title="Tomo Sakurai">
<text>is a Japanese actress and singer. Sakurai was a member of I&#x27;m Enterprise but later became freelance until her retirement. She previously announced her retirement on September 1, 2016, but on June 1, 2019, she announced that she would return to the entertainment industry.

== Career ==
=== Debut ===
At 14, Sakurai debuted as a sub-member for &quot;Kiss Fairlies,&quot; a group that worked as campaign girls for the local Kijima Motorcycle Racing Team. All members were over 15 years old, aside from Tomo.

=== In age of &quot;Lemon Angel&quot; ===
At 17, she joined the idol-pop unit, Lemon Angel, a counter project of Cream Lemon coordinated by the same company that produced &quot;Kiss Fairlies&quot;. The project contained comic, animated, and idol pop units. The unit played themselves in Midnight Anime Lemon Angel. She released 5 albums during her time at Lemon Angel.

=== After Lemon Angel ===
Sakurai joined a new video game idol unit and released one album with this unit. After leaving, she focused her career mainly on voice acting work.

=== Retirement ===
On September 1, 2016, Sakurai announced her retirement from her professional voice acting and singing careers on her official blog post titled &quot;Arigato/Thank You.&quot;

She explained: &quot;I used to have a strong vocal cord that couldn&#x27;t be broken and became stronger even after singing for hours. But recently, I have realized it&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult for me to use my important voice as an actress. I know it&#x27;s a natural thing as time goes by, but I can&#x27;t accept the change, then I understand it&#x27;s almost time to retire.&quot;

=== Return ===
On June 1, 2019, Sakurai announced that she was returning to the entertainment industry.

<text>The Aero Ae 50 was a prototype propeller-driven military reconnaissance aircraft built in Czechoslovakia.
==Design and development==

In November 1947, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence issued requirements for two light aircraft for service in support of the Czechoslovak Army, a smaller two seat aircraft, to be powered by the Walter Minor 4-III engine and a larger aircraft to be powered by the Walter Minor 6-III engine. The smaller aircraft was intended for artillery spotting, observation and liaison duties. The aircraft was required to provide a good view for the observer and to be able to operate out of small austere airstrips. It needed to have folding wings and be able to be towed behind, or carried on the back of a 2.5te truck. It was also required to be towed by other aircraft, to extend the aircraft&#x27;s range.

At least eight projects were submitted to meet the requirement for a lighter aircraft, with Aero&#x27;s design, the Ae 50, considered the best of the proposals. The Ae 50 was a high-wing monoplane of all metal construction, of pod and boom arrangement, with a fuselage that terminated abruptly immediately aft of the crew cabin, leaving the tailplane to be mounted on a single boom attached to the wing. It had a fixed, tail-wheel type undercarriage, with the tailwheel mounted at the rear of the fuselage. The wings were fitted with flaps and leading-edge slots. 

Construction of a prototype began in mid-1948, and it was first flown on 14 April 1949. Initial testing identified a number of problems, including problems with the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage, poor directional control during take-off, and crucially, that the aircraft was significantly overweight. The aircraft underwent numerous changes to fix the aircraft&#x27;s problems, including a larger rudder and modified wing slots and while these resolved many of the aircraft&#x27;s problems, the aircraft remained overweight. It was handed over to the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defence for testing against the specification in October 1949, but on 13 June 1950, the Czechoslovak government decided to abandon development of observation aircraft, in order to concentrate the aircraft industry on license-production of Soviet combat aircraft. Flight testing continued slowly after this decision and was not completed until January 1953. After testing was complete, it was retained without being flown further for two years before being scrapped.

<text>Mark Stephen Shields (May 25, 1937 – June 18, 2022) was an American political columnist, advisor, and commentator. He worked in leadership positions for many Democratic candidates&#x27; electoral campaigns.

Shields provided weekly political analysis and commentary for the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; from 1988 to 2020. His on-screen counterpart from 2001 to 2020 was David Brooks of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Previous counterparts were the late William Safire, Paul Gigot of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and David Gergen. Shields was also a regular panelist on &quot;Inside Washington&quot;, a weekly public affairs show that was seen on both PBS and ABC until it ceased production in December 2013. Shields was moderator and panelist on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Capital Gang&quot; for 17 years.

== Early life and education ==

Shields was born on May 25, 1937, and raised in Weymouth, Massachusetts, in an Irish Catholic family, the son of Mary (Fallon), a schoolteacher, and William Shields, a paper salesman, who was involved in local politics. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1959 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy.

==Career==
In the early 1960s, Shields enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in Florida. He was a lance corporal before he was discharged in 1962.

Shields was based in Washington D.C. from 1965, initially working as an aide to Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire. Shields joined Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1968. He later held leadership positions in the presidential campaigns of Edmund Muskie and Morris Udall, and was political director for Sargent Shriver when he ran for Vice President of the United States on the Democratic ticket in 1972. Over more than a decade, he helped manage state and local campaigns in some 38 states, including incumbent Boston mayor Kevin White&#x27;s successful re-election campaign in 1975.

In 1979, Shields became an editorial writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. The same year, he began writing a column which was distributed nationally by Creators Syndicate. He covered 12 presidential campaigns and attended 24 national party conventions. He taught U.S. politics and the press at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School and Georgetown University&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy. In addition he was a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School.

Shields was a regular political commentator on the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; from 1988 to 2020. Anchorwoman Judy Woodruff announced on the December 14, 2020, edition of the &quot;NewsHour&quot; that Shields would be leaving the show as a regular analyst after its December 18 edition. During Shields&#x27;s last regular appearance on December 18, Woodruff added that he would remain an occasional contributor to the &quot;NewsHour&quot; during important political news and events.

Shields was the author of &quot;On the Campaign Trail&quot;, about the 1984 presidential campaign.

== Personal life ==
Shields married Anne Hudson, who is a lawyer and former civil service official at the United States Department of the Interior, in 1966. The couple have a daughter, Amy Shields Doyle, and two grandchildren.

He was on the board of directors of SOME (So Others Might Eat) and he established the William and Mary Shields Scholarship Program in honor of his parents at the University of Notre Dame for students who are the first members of their families to go to college.

Shields was a Catholic.

==Death==
Shields died from kidney failure at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on June 18, 2022, aged 85.

<doc id="1003930" wikidata="Q13056610" url="?curid=1003930" title="Cunninghamia">
<text>Cunninghamia is a genus of one or two living species of evergreen coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae. They are native to China, northern Vietnam and Laos, and perhaps also Cambodia. They may reach in height. In vernacular use, it is most often known as &quot;Cunninghamia&quot;, but is also sometimes called &quot;China-fir&quot; (though it is not a fir). The genus name &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; honours Dr. James Cunningham, a British doctor who introduced this species into cultivation in 1702 and botanist Allan Cunningham.

==Description==
The general shape of the tree is conical with tiered, horizontal branches that are often somewhat pendulous toward the tips. &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; bears softly spined, leathery, stiff, green to blue-green needle-like leaves that spiral around the stem with an upward arch; they are 2–7cm long and 3–5mm broad at the base, and bear two white or greenish white stomatal bands underneath and sometimes also above. The foliage may turn bronze-tinted in very cold winter weather.

The cones are small and inconspicuous at pollination in late winter, the pollen cones in clusters of 10–30 together, the female cones singly or 2–3 together.

The seed cones mature in 7–8 months to 2.5–4.5cm long, ovoid to globose, with spirally arranged scales; each scale bears 3–5 seeds. They are often proliferous (with a vegetative shoot growing on beyond the tip of the cone) on cultivated trees; this is rare in wild trees, and may be a cultivar selected for easy vegetative propagation for use in forestry plantations.

As the tree grows its trunk tends to sucker around the base, particularly following damage to the stem or roots, and it then may grow in a multi-trunked form. Brown bark of mature trees peels off in strips to reveal reddish-brown inner bark. Older specimens often look ragged, as the old needles may cling to stems for up to 5 years.

Although it resembles conifer species found in much colder climates, the tree is highly tolerant of heat and can be found growing down to sea level in regions such as Hong Kong.

==Taxonomy==
It is the most basal extant member of the Cupressaceae. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that its lineage diverged from the rest of the family during the early Jurassic. Fossil representatives of the subfamily Cunninghamioideae, of which &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; is the only living member, extend back to the Middle Jurassic. The subfamily, which has 12 described genera, experienced a high diversity during the Cretaceous, but underwent a severe decline at the end of the Cretaceous, leaving &quot;Cunninghamia&quot; as the only living genus by the beginning of the Cenozoic.

In the past, the genus was usually treated in the family Taxodiaceae, but this family is now included within the Cupressaceae. A few botanists have also treated it in a family of its own, Cunninghamiaceae, but this is not widely followed. The oldest fossil species of the genus are from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) of North America, including &quot;Cunninghamia hornbyensis&quot; from British Columbia, Canada, and &quot;Cunninghamia taylorii&quot; from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. Other fossils are known from the Cenozoic of Asia, North America and Europe.

The genus is traditionally said to contain two similar species, &quot;Cunninghamia lanceolata&quot; and &quot;C. konishii&quot;, often referred to as the China fir and Taiwan fir, respectively. &quot;C. lanceolata&quot; occurs in mainland China, Vietnam, and Laos, whereas &quot;C. konishii&quot; is restricted to Taiwan. However, molecular genetic evidence is suggesting that they are the same species, and that &quot;C. konishii&quot; of Taiwan derive from multiple colonizations from the mainland. As &quot;C. lanceolata&quot; was the first name published, this name takes priority if the two are combined. In that case, Taiwan fir becomes &quot;Cunninghamia lanceolata&quot; var. &quot;konishii&quot;. However, there is no consensus yet as to whether the two species should be combined.

==Usage==
&quot;Cunninghamia&quot; is a prized timber tree in China, producing soft, highly durable scented wood similar to that of Coast Redwood and Sugi. It is used in particular for manufacture of coffins and in temple building where the scent is valued.

&quot;Cunninghamia&quot; is grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, where it typically reaches a height of 15–30 m. Due to its heat tolerance, it has been used as a Christmas tree in subtropical areas such as the southern USA.

<text>The Schoolhouse Blizzard, also known as the Schoolchildren&#x27;s Blizzard, School Children&#x27;s Blizzard, or Children&#x27;s Blizzard, hit the U.S. Great Plains on January 12, 1888. With an estimated 235 deaths, it is the world&#x27;s 10th deadliest winter storm on record.
== Description ==
The blizzard came unexpectedly on a relatively warm day, and many people were caught unaware, including children in one-room schoolhouses.

The weather prediction for the day was issued by the Weather Bureau, which at the time was managed by Brigadier General Adolphus Greely. The indications officer (forecaster), Lieutenant Thomas Mayhew Woodruff in St. Paul, Minnesota, said: &quot;A cold wave is indicated for Dakota and Nebraska tonight and tomorrow; the snow will drift heavily today and tomorrow in Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.&quot;

On January 11, a strengthening surface low dropped south-southeastward out of the Alberta District in Canada&#x27;s North-West Territories into central Montana Territory and then into northeastern Colorado by the morning of January 12. The temperatures in advance of the low increased some in the central plains (for example, Omaha, Nebraska, recorded a temperature of at 7 a.m. on January 11, while the temperature had increased to by 7 a.m. on January 12). The strong surface low rapidly moved into southeastern Nebraska by 3 p.m. on January 12 and finally into southwestern Wisconsin by 11 p.m. that same day. On January 11, the massive cold air mass that had formed around January 8 around Medicine Hat and Qu&#x27;Appelle, Assiniboia District, had reached a spread of over .

The blizzard was precipitated by the collision of an immense Arctic cold front with warm moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico. Within a few hours, the advancing cold front caused a temperature drop from a few degrees above freezing to [ in some places]. This wave of cold was accompanied by high winds and heavy snow. The fast-moving storm first struck Montana in the early hours of January 12, swept through Dakota Territory from midmorning to early afternoon, and reached Lincoln, Nebraska, at 3 p.m.

Many who were caught unaware misjudged the weather due to a warm spell. Carl Saltee, a teenage Norwegian immigrant in Fortier, Minnesota, remembered that &quot;... on the 12th of January 1888 around noontime it was so warm it melted snow and ice from the window until after 1 p.m.&quot; This changed rapidly for the teenager who continued that by 3:30 p.m. &quot;A dark and heavy wall built up around the northwest coming fast, coming like those heavy thunderstorms, like a shot. In a few moments, we had the severest snowstorm I ever saw in my life with a terrible hard wind, like a Hurricane, snow so thick we could not see more than 3 steps from the door at times.&quot; The &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot; reported under the headline &quot;Midnight at Noon&quot; that &quot;At Fargo ... mercury 47° below zero and a hurricane blowing ... At Neche, Dak. the thermometer is 58° below zero.&quot;

What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness of the storm, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people — including many schoolchildren — got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235, though some estimate 1,000. Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster.

This cold front was so self-reinforced that it dropped temperatures as far south as Veracruz, Mexico, before dissipating.

Travel was severely impeded in the days following.

Two months later, yet another severe blizzard hit the East Coast states: This blizzard was known as the Great Blizzard of 1888. It severely affected the east coast, in states like New York and Massachusetts.

== The stories ==

* Plainview, Nebraska: Lois Royce found herself trapped with three of her students in her schoolhouse. By 3 p.m., they had run out of heating fuel. Her boarding house was only away, so she attempted to lead the children there. However, visibility was so poor that they became lost. The children, two 9-year-old boys and a 6-year-old girl, froze to death. The teacher survived, but her feet were frostbitten and had to be amputated.
* Seward County, Nebraska: Etta Shattuck, a 19-year-old schoolteacher, got lost on her way home and sought shelter in a haystack. She remained trapped there until her rescue 78 hours later by Daniel D. Murphy and his hired men. She died on February 6 or 7 due to complications from surgery to remove her frostbitten feet and legs.
* Near Zeona, Dakota Territory: The children at the local school were rescued. Two men tied a rope to the closest house and headed for the school. There, they tied off the other end of the rope and led the children to safety.
* Mira Valley, Nebraska: Minnie Freeman safely led 13 children from her schoolhouse to her home, away. A rumor that she used a rope to keep the children together during the blinding storm is widely circulated, but one of the children claimed it was not true. That year, &quot;Song of the Great Blizzard: Thirteen Were Saved&quot; or &quot;Nebraska&#x27;s Fearless Maid&quot;, was written and recorded in her honor by William Vincent and published by Lyon &amp; Healy.
** In 1967, for Nebraska&#x27;s Centennial Celebration, a Venetian glass mural of the Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888 by Jeanne Reynal was installed on the west wall of the north bay in the Nebraska State Capitol building. The mural, in a semi-abstract style, portrays Freeman leading the children through the storm to safety.
* Ted Kooser, a Nebraska poet, has recorded many of the stories of the Schoolhouse Blizzard in his book of poetry &quot;The Blizzard Voices&quot;.
* Ron Hansen, a Nebraska-born author, follows the experience of the blizzard from a variety of perspectives in his short story &quot;Wickedness,&quot; featured in the collections &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;.
* A 36-year-old Scottish immigrant farmer, James Jackson, just outside of Woodstock, Minnesota, discovered his cattle herd frozen to death in a stretch.
* Newspaperman Charles Morse, founder of the &quot;Lake Benton News,&quot; recounted, &quot;My sleeping quarters were on the second floor leading off a hallway at the head of the stairs ... On arriving home I found the wind had forced open the door and the stairway was packed with snow, and when I reached my room I found my bed covered with several inches of snow which had filtered over the threshold and through my keyhole.&quot;
* Pioneers William and Kate Kampen, who lived in a small sod house in Marion, Dakota Territory, were caught ill-prepared for the blizzard. They ran out of coal for their fire, so William was forced to leave for the town of Parker, some away to buy more coal and supplies. He took two of his horses with him. While William was gone, 19-year-old Kate gave birth alone to their first son, Henry Royal Kampen, on January 8. While William was in town, the blizzard hit. Several of William&#x27;s friends tried to persuade him to stay in town, but he knew he had to get back home to Kate, not knowing she had given birth. The storm raged on as he tried to make his way back home. He stayed with his horses, but eventually, both of them died because the wind was so strong that both the horses suffocated. William was able to find a barn with pigs in it, and crawled in with them to try to keep warm. Meanwhile, Kate kept herself and the baby warm by staying in bed. William finally made it back home to Kate and the baby after spending three days and nights out on the prairie alone.
* Lauren Tarshis published a book in February 2018 about the Children&#x27;s Blizzard in her &quot;I Survived&quot; book series, focusing on a character named John.

== Memorial book ==
In the 1940s a group organized the Greater Nebraska Blizzard Club to write a book about the storm. The resulting book, &quot;In All Its Fury: A History of the Blizzard of Jan. 12, 1888, With Stories and Reminiscences&quot;, was edited by W.H. O&#x27;Gara.

<doc id="1003946" wikidata="Q687057" url="?curid=1003946" title="Verdon Gorge">
<text>The Verdon Gorge (French: &quot;Gorges du Verdon&quot; ) is a river canyon located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of Southeastern France. It is about 25 km (15.5 mi) long and up to 700 metres (0.4 mi) deep. It was formed by the Verdon River, which is named for its turquoise-green colour, one of the location&#x27;s distinguishing characteristics. In between the towns of Castellane and Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, the river has cut a ravine to a depth of 700 meters through the limestone mass. At the end of the canyon, the Verdon flows into the artificial Lake of Sainte-Croix.

The gorge is very popular with tourists, who can drive around its rim, rent kayaks to travel on the river, or hike. The limestone walls, which are several hundreds of metres high, attract many rock climbers. It is considered an outstanding destination for multi-pitch climbing, with 1,500 routes available ranging from 20 metres (65 feet) to over 400 metres (1,300 feet).

==History==

During the Triassic period, the Provence subsided and was covered by the sea, leaving thick layers of various limestone deposits. Several million years later, with the arrival of the Jurassic period, the area was covered by a warm shallow sea, which allowed the growth of various corals. The Cretaceous period saw what is now &quot;Basse Provence&quot; being raised and the sea reaching the current location of the Alps, which were themselves erected during the tertiary era. As a result of the large-scale geological activity, many of the Jurassic limestone deposits fractured, forming relief with valleys and other such features. The origins of the Verdon Gorge can be traced to this era.

The dawn of the Quaternary period had large-scale glaciation, transforming water pockets and lakes into rivers of ice, which remodeled the topography, scouring and striating the landscape. At the end of this activity, erosion by rivers continued, forming the Gorge as it is today. The Verdon&#x27;s riverbed was scoured for a second time of the accumulated coral and limestone sediments, by a water delivery rate nearing 2000 to 3000 cubic metres per second.

===Discovery===
The gorge was described in printed form from 1782 and 1804. By the second half of the 19th century, it was featured in French tourist guides. According to Graham Robb&#x27;s book &quot;The Discovery of France,&quot; the gorge did not become known outside France until 1906.

===Recent developments===
On 10 July 2006, the Council of State annulled the declaration of public use of a project by EDF relating to a proposed high-voltage line which would have had to pass through the Verdon Gorge. This decision ended 23 years of struggle by public groups and associations of environmental defence to preserve a site of exceptional natural interest, of which a part contains protected animal and plant species.

During the 2022 European drought, the water levels in the river were very low and dried up completely in some parts.

==Geography==

The source of the Verdon is close to the col d&#x27;Allos hill in the Trois Eveches mountain range, whence it continues, flowing into the Durance river near Vinon-sur-Verdon after traveling 175 kilometres. Between Castellane and the Galetas bridge, the river passes through the lake of Sainte-Croix, created by the construction of a dam of the same name. Before the dam was constructed, the village of Les Salles-sur-Verdon occupied the river plain. To create the reservoir, the village was destroyed in 1973. Les Salles-sur-Verdon was reconstructed as a more modern settlement higher up the valley. Today, it is the youngest village in France.

For some distance the Verdon Gorge forms the border between the départements of Var to the south and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence to the north in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur région.

This region between Castellane and the Lac de Sainte-Croix is called the &quot;Gorges du Verdon&quot;, or Verdon Gorge. It is split into three distinct parts:
* &quot;Prégorges&quot; (&#x27;pre-gorge&#x27;), from Castellane to Pont de Soleils,
* the deepest part of the Gorge, from Pont de Soleils to l&#x27;Imbut, and
* the Canyon from l’Imbut to the Pont du Galetas.

The Verdon Gorge is narrow and deep, with depths of 250 to 700 metres and widths of 6 to 100 metres at the level of the Verdon river. It is 200 to 1500 metres wide from one side of the Gorge to the other at the summits. The Gorge has been compared to the Grand Canyon in the United States.

==Hydro-electric dams==

Between 1929 and 1975, five dams were erected on the course of the Verdon, between Castellane and Gréoux-les-Bains. These dams hold back water in the following reservoirs:
*Lac de Castillon, which was created by flooding the village of the same name
*Lac de Sainte-Croix, flooded the village of des Salles-sur-Verdon.
*Lac d&#x27;Esparron-Gréoux, known locally as &quot;lac d’Esparron&quot;.
*Reservoir at Chaudanne
*Reservoir at Quinson, sometimes improperly called the &quot;lac de Montpezat&quot;, the name of the village over which it dominates.

==Notable features==

The Styx du Verdon, associated with the river Styx of Greek mythology, is an area of sub-canyon within the gorge.

The &quot;Imbut&quot;, also known as &quot;Embut&quot; or &quot;Embucq&quot;, is an area where the Verdon disappears underground, beneath enormous rock structures, before re-emerging above ground.

==Tourism==
The Verdon Gorge attracts numerous tourists, especially during the summer period. The river&#x27;s turquoise colour is associated with glacial sources and the minerals of rock flour suspended in the water.

It is easily accessible on its right bank from the north (via route D952 from Castellane to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie), and on its left bank from the south (via routes D71, D90 and D955 from Aiguines to Castellane).

==Sport==
*The Verdon Gorge attracts many rock climbers for its more than 1,500 climbing routes on good limestone rock
*The Verdon and its Gorge are also a favoured destination for fishermen, particularly for fly fishing.
*Hiking, canoeing, paragliding, rafting, climbing and canyoning are some of the sports practised in the region.

==Hiking and scenic walks==
The most common hikes in the gorge include:

* Le sentier (pathway) de Martel
* Le sentier de l&#x27;Imbut
* Le sentier du Bastidon
* Le belvédère de Rancoumas par le pont de Tusset (the Rancoumas panoramic viewpoint near the Tusset Bridge)

The Sentier Martel, was laid out in 1928 by the Touring Club de France. It was named in 1930 to honor the explorer Édouard-Alfred Martel (1859–1938). Martel had visited the Verdon in 1905 as an employee of the Southeast Electricity Company, carrying out precise geological surveys of the river. On 11 August, he and his team (explorer Armand Janet, schoolmaster Isidore Blanc, geographer Cuvelier, plaus Baptistin Flory, Fernand Honorat, Prosper Marcel, and Tessier Zurcher) began an expedition of the region. Their successful arrival at the Pas de Galetas marked the completion of the first expedition of the Verdon Canyon.

Other expeditions to the Verdon included Martel&#x27;s team the following year; followed by Robert de Joly, who in 1928 was the first to completely cross the Verdon Gorge.

<text>Praktica was a brand of camera manufactured by Pentacon in Dresden in eastern Germany, within the GDR between 1949 and the German reunification in 1990. 
The firm Pentacon was divided in mainly two parts and sold after German reunification. Schneider Kreuznach and Noble bought parts of it. 
Pentacon is a Dresden-based company in the optical and precision engineering industry, which was at times a major manufacturer of photo cameras. The name Pentacon is derived on the one hand from the Contax brand of the Dresden Zeiss Ikon Kamerawerke and Pentagon (Greek for pentagon), because a pentaprism for SLR cameras developed for the first time in Dresden has this shape in cross section. 
Today&#x27;s PENTACON GmbH Foto- und Feinwerktechnik is still based in Dresden. It is part of the Schneider Group, Bad Kreuznach. Pentacon is the modern-day successor to Dresden camera firms such as Zeiss Ikon; for many years Dresden was the world&#x27;s largest producer of cameras. Previous brands of the predecessor firms included Praktica, Exa, Pentacon, Zeiss Ikon, Contax (now owned by the Carl Zeiss company), Ica, Ernemann, Exakta, Praktiflex, and many more.

Among the innovative legacies of the predecessor firms are the roll film SLR camera in 1933, the 35mm SLR in 1936, and the pentaprism SLR in 1949. After WWII the company&#x27;s products were best known in the Eastern Bloc countries, though some were exported to the west. They currently produce both budget lenses (mostly small, not very durable, and having manual focus, but good in optical quality) and higher priced products . They also produce optical equipment for the space programs of the US, Western Europe and Russia. 

In 2001, the production of Praktica Analogue SLR cameras was discontinued with the focus shifting to a range of Praktica digital compact cameras and camcorders together with an extensive range of binoculars, spotting scopes, accessories and other optical imaging products.
Praktica today produces many products under various brands such as auto industry products, 3D LCD screens, and still cameras and lenses under their own Praktica brand and also more known international brands. Since September 2015 the owner of the Praktica brand has been Praktica Ltd, a UK limited company.

<doc id="1003976" wikidata="Q484540" url="?curid=1003976" title="Tarja Turunen">
<text>Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born 17 August 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish heavy metal singer, best known as the former lead vocalist of Nightwish. 

Turunen studied lyrical singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer with a three-octave vocal range, and founded symphonic metal band Nightwish with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen&#x27;s dramatic, &quot;operatic&quot; lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed &quot;opera metal&quot;, inspired many other metal bands and performers.

Turunen was fired from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band&#x27;s &quot;End of an Era&quot; concert) for personal reasons accompanied by an open letter from the band. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called &quot;Henkäys ikuisuudesta&quot;. In 2007, Turunen released &quot;My Winter Storm&quot;, an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the Storm World Tour. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the Graspop Metal Meeting and the Wacken Open Air, before releasing her third album, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, supported by a tour, which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD &quot;Act I&quot; was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in Argentina. &quot;Act I&quot; was released in August 2012. Turunen started the Colours in the Dark World Tour in October 2013 to promote her new album &quot;Colours in the Dark&quot;. Her second live DVD was filmed during the events of &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; with Mike Terrana and was released in May.

In September 2015, Turunen released her first classical studio album, &quot;Ave Maria – En Plein Air&quot;. In August 2016 she released her sixth studio album &quot;The Shadow Self&quot;, with a prequel EP &quot;The Brightest Void&quot; released on 3 June. On 17 November 2017, she released her second Christmas album, &quot;From Spirits and Ghosts&quot;, putting a dark orchestral twist on various classic holiday songs. In 2018, she released the follow-up to her first live album, &quot;Act II&quot;, which was filmed during her world tour for &quot;The Shadow Self&quot;. Her eighth studio album and her fifth metal album, &quot;In the Raw&quot;, was released on 30 August 2019. Turunen&#x27;s third Christmas album and the follow-up sequel to &quot;From Spirits and Ghosts&quot;, entitled &quot;Dark Christmas&quot;, was released on 10 November 2023.

==Life and career==
===1977–1995: Early life===
Tarja Turunen was born in the small village of Puhos, near Kitee, Finland. She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song &quot;Enkeli taivaan&quot; (the Finnish version of &quot;From Heaven Above to Earth I Come&quot;) in the Kitee church hall at age three. She joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.

At comprehensive school, Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen (Tuomas Holopainen&#x27;s mother), &quot;Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.&quot; Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, &quot;If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you&#x27;d have to practice three, four, five times&quot;. At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.

For several years Turunen performed various songs including soul music by Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Later she listened to songs from the classical crossover singer Sarah Brightman, especially the song &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and decided to focus on that genre of music. At eighteen, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy.

===1996–2005: Nightwish===
In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen&#x27;s voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen&#x27;s voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.

Nightwish recorded a second demo with &quot;more bombastic, dramatic&quot; songs in September 1997. Holopainen used this material to convince the Finnish label Spinefarm Records to publish the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;. The success of the first album came as a surprise to the label. As the album hit the top 40 of the Finnish charts, Nightwish started touring in clubs around Finland. That same year, Turunen performed at the Savonlinna Opera Festival for the first time, singing arias from Wagner and Verdi.

Due to her commitment to the band, Turunen was not able to concentrate sufficiently on her schoolwork and her academic studies were interrupted. In 1998, Nightwish published their second album, &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. This album lacked the earlier elements of folk and ambient music, and instead focused on fast, melodic keyboard and guitar lines and Turunen&#x27;s dramatic voice. In addition to the Nightwish tour in 1999, Turunen sang solo in Waltari&#x27;s rock-themed ballet &quot;Evankeliumi&quot; (also known as &quot;Evangelicum&quot;) in several sold-out performances at the Finnish National Opera. In 2000 and 2001, Nightwish recorded &quot;Wishmaster&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; and toured Europe and South America. During the Wishmaster World Tour, Turunen met Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli, owner of the record label and tour promotion company NEMS Enterprises, whom she married in 2002.

Turunen enrolled in 2000 at the German music university Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe to gain a professional qualification as a soloist with further specialization in art song. In addition to the good reputation of the university, Turunen chose to go to Karlsruhe because some people at the Finnish university did not take her seriously as a classical singer due to her commitment in a metal band. While there, she recorded vocals for Nightwish&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Century Child&quot; and for Beto Vázquez Infinity. As with the other albums, Holopainen wrote the pieces and sent Turunen the lyrics and a demo recording of the prerecorded instrumental tracks by mail. Using the demo, Turunen designed her vocal lines and the choral passages.

In 2002, Turunen toured South America, performing in the classical Lied concert &quot;Noche Escandinava&quot; (&quot;Scandinavian Night&quot;) to sold-out houses. Following this and an exhausting world tour in support of &quot;Century Child&quot;, Nightwish took a hiatus and Turunen returned to Karlsruhe to finish her studies. After the hiatus Nightwish recorded the album &quot;Once&quot;; it was released in May 2004. The album has sold platinum in Finland and Germany and was the best selling album in all of Europe in July 2004. The band performed in the supporting Once Upon a Tour throughout 2004 and 2005.

For Christmas 2004, Turunen released her first solo single, titled &quot;Yhden enkelin unelma&quot; (One Angel&#x27;s Dream), which sold gold in her native country of Finland. At Christmas 2005 it made a reentry at position one in the Finnish Charts. In spring 2005 she prepared the duet &quot;Leaving You for Me&quot;, a collaboration with Martin Kesici, accompanied by a video.

====Departure from the band====

The first change in the line up of Nightwish was in September 2001, when bassist Sami Vänskä was fired because Holopainen was no longer able to continue working with him. In the following years the relationship between Holopainen and Turunen&#x27;s husband and manager Marcelo Cabuli deteriorated. This affected the relationship between Holopainen and Turunen as well. At a band meeting after the concert in Oberhausen in December 2004, Turunen informed the band members that she wanted to leave the band, but agreed to record one more album and to participate in the subsequent tour, planned for 2006/2007. According to her husband, Turunen had further agreed not to make her decision public and to release her first solo album after the new studio album from Nightwish. After the last concert of the &quot;Once Upon a Tour&quot; on 21 October 2005 (which was released on video as &quot;End of an Era&quot;), Holopainen and the other band members informed Turunen in an open letter that the band did not want to work with her any more, accusing her of diva-like behaviour and greed: 
The split and, due to the open letter&#x27;s allegations, Turunen&#x27;s character became the subject of close media coverage. Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, her husband Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to the greed accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band&#x27;s income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.

Despite the circumstances of the separation, Holopainen&#x27;s appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen said in an interview that she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wished all the best for them and their subsequent then-lead singer Anette Olzon.

===2005–2009: Solo career beginnings, &quot;Henkäys ikuisuudesta&quot;, &quot;My Winter Storm&quot;===
At the end of 2005, Turunen performed several classical concerts in Finland, Germany, Spain, and Romania. Since she expected to participate in another Nightwish album, several concerts and the release of her Christmas album &quot;Henkäys ikuisuudesta&quot; (officially translated as &quot;Breath from Heaven&quot;) were the only activities scheduled for 2006. Turunen again played at the Savonlinna Opera Festival in July 2006, this time as the main act; she sang alongside Finnish tenor Raimo Sirkiä, supported by the Kuopio Symphonic Orchestra. Turunen performed classical arias like &quot;O mio babbino caro&quot; by Puccini, &quot;Libiamo ne&#x27; lieti calici&quot; by Verdi and some songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber—&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;—among other songs. In November she performed at the charity concert &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Child&quot; with the Tapiola Choir as a benefit for the UNICEF Children&#x27;s Fund. On 6 December 2006, Turunen performed a big concert at the Sibelius Hall in Lahti, Finland; it was broadcast live by the Finnish channel YLE TV2 for 450,000 viewers. She was nominated for the Finnish Emma Award as Best Soloist of 2006. The following year, Turunen recorded vocals for the track &quot;In the Picture&quot; on the Nuclear Blast All-stars album &quot;Into the Light&quot;.
In August 2006 she started to work on her next solo album, &quot;My Winter Storm&quot;, the beginning of her main solo project. It was the first time that Turunen had written songs. She was supported by some professional songwriters. The choir and orchestral arrangements were written by film music composer James Dooley. Turunen released &quot;My Winter Storm&quot;, an album featuring various styles, including symphonic metal with classical &quot;operatic&quot; lead vocals, in November 2007. The album took the number one spot on the Finnish charts, and went platinum in Finland double platinum in Russia and gold in Germany.

She was nominated for an Echo as best newcomer and an Emma for best Finnish artist. On 25 November 2007, Turunen embarked on the Storm World Tour to promote &quot;My Winter Storm&quot;. She performed 95 concerts throughout Europe, North and South America and ended the tour in October 2009 at the O2 Academy Islington in London. In December 2008, the EP &quot;The Seer&quot; was released in the UK and the new extended edition of &quot;My Winter Storm&quot; released in January 2009.

She also contributed three songs to the Finnish charity Christmas album &quot;Maailman kauneimmat joululaulut&quot; (Finnish for &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Christmas Songs&quot;) released in November 2009. In December 2009 she recorded her vocal part for the song &quot;The Good Die Young&quot;, a duet with Klaus Meine which is included on the final Scorpions album &quot;Sting in the Tail&quot;.

===2010–2014: &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, &quot;Colours in the Dark&quot;===

Turunen recorded her third album, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, in 2009 and 2010; it was released in September 2010. The album combined metal with classical &quot;operatic&quot; elements in an out of the box approach. She started the What Lies Beneath World Tour performing in several festivals, including the Wacken Open Air and the Graspop Metal Meeting, with special concerts at Miskolc Opera Festival and at the Masters of Rock, where she performed accompanied by a full orchestra. The tour lasted until April 2012. Also in 2010 she supported Alice Cooper on the German leg of his Theatre of Death Tour. 

On 17 July 2011, she sang again at the Savonlinna Opera Festival along with acclaimed tenor José Cura and accompanied by the Kuopio Symphony Orchestra.
In March 2012, Turunen won the title &quot;Europe&#x27;s best crossover performer&quot; with over 100,000 votes.

In May 2013, Turunen announced the title of her 4th solo album, &quot;Colours in the Dark&quot;, which was released on 30 August. On 31 May the song &quot;Never Enough&quot; was released as a teaser. Later this year, in September, it was revealed that Turunen would appear as guest vocalist on the title track and video of Within Temptation&#x27;s EP &quot;Paradise&quot;, released on 27 September.

In January 2014, Turunen revealed through her blog that she would soon return to the studio and record vocals for a couple of songs for her &quot;Outlanders&quot; project together with Torsten Stenzel &amp; Walter Giardino.

In May 2014, it was released the DVD &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot;, providing live footage from 3 concerts as part of the Beauty and the Beat World Tour. The DVD shows Tarja performing live with a symphonic orchestra, choir and Mike Terrana on drums. Songs include Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Song to the Moon&quot; from &quot;Rusalka&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot;, and also a live version of the rarely performed song &quot;Swanheart&quot; from the 1998 Nightwish album &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. On the same year, in July, &quot;Left in the Dark&quot; was released as an EP containing alternative versions from Tarja&#x27;s album &quot;Colours in the Dark&quot;, as well as a studio version of &quot;Into the Sun&quot;.

===2015–2018: &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;The Shadow Self&quot;, &quot;From Spirits and Ghosts&quot;===

On 22 July 2015, it was announced that Tarja would be releasing her first fully classical album, &quot;Ave Maria – En Plein Air&quot;.

Tarja announced she is to release a new album in the summer of 2016. She explains that &quot;she has been working hard once again with Tim Palmer to create the heaviest sound so far of her career for her fourth rock album&quot;. She also explained that the album will follow in the same footsteps as her other albums but with a new soul and growth. A teaser with a snippet of two songs was then released on her official YouTube channel. On 17 February 2016, Tarja also revealed the first letter of the album name to be T.

==Singing style==
===Development===
Along with visiting the music school in Savonlinna, Turunen began serious classical vocal training at 17. After school, she began studying music (with a specialization in church music) at the Sibelius Academy. When she began singing, she could &quot;shatter a lamp&quot; with her voice. Due to her commitment with Nightwish, she had to interrupt her academic studies.

From 2001 to 2003, she studied at the music academy Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe, where she trained as a soloist with further specialization in art songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Hammer 06/2004&quot;&gt;&quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, July 2004, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Turunen originally applied to train as a choir singer. At the audition she attracted the attention of professor Mitsuko Shirai, who encouraged Turunen to apply for soloist training.

As a classical singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained that in the early days of Nightwish, it was difficult to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.

Towards the turn of the millennium, the combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with classical female lead vocals attracted a great deal of attention in the metal scene. The new music style of Nightwish quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity; this symphonic metal style was soon dubbed &quot;opera metal&quot;. Turunen does not see herself as an opera singer. She has sung excerpts from operas at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, but she stresses that singing opera cannot be performed as a side project. She would need special training to perfectly sing an entire opera without a microphone.

When asked how the association between the opera and metal genres may have arisen, Turunen said that despite the obvious differences, the two music styles have some similarities:
From the first Nightwish album &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; (1997) on, critics described Turunen&#x27;s vocals using adjectives such as &quot;angelic&quot; or &quot;valkyrian&quot;. The Valkyrie image was later fostered by the second video for the single &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot; in which Turunen walks on a battlefield as if she were guiding the dead warriors.
On the following albums the singing was technically more complex. On the Nightwish album &quot;Oceanborn&quot; (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable. For the song &quot;Passion and the Opera&quot;, Turunen performed a staccato coloratura reminiscent of the aria &quot;Hell&#x27;s vengeance boils in my heart&quot;, sung by the soprano role Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s opera The Magic Flute. &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot; required a well-trained breathing technique. Turunen explained in an interview that when they recorded &quot;Oceanborn&quot;, she had serious doubts, fearing that she was not yet advanced enough in her studies to have mastered the required techniques.

A challenge of a different kind was the cover version of Gary Moore&#x27;s &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (2001), as it required a deeper voice, far below the vocal range of an average soprano. In an interview with &quot;Breakout&quot; magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm of laughter as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines. As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the lower range, which manifested even more on the following albums.

For the album &quot;Century Child&quot; (2002), she experimented with a more &quot;rock&quot; sounding voice, where she maintained the classical singing technique, but, for example, sang with less vibrato. Turunen was not satisfied that she had successfully transitioned to this new style until the album &quot;Once&quot; (2004).

This deeper &quot;rock&quot;-sounding voice on &quot;Once&quot;—as well as on the song &quot;In the Picture&quot; of the album &quot;Into the Light&quot;—was welcomed by critics as a refreshing change.

Her first solo album &quot;My Winter Storm&quot; (2007) contains rock and metal songs as well as songs that resemble classical songs. Turunen uses both her classical singing voice and a rock-sounding voice. In many songs she starts with a rock voice, and then switches for widely arching melodies into a distinctly classical singing voice.

In an interview, she explained that &quot;My Winter Storm&quot; was the first album where she had the chance to use her full vocal range.

===Register===

Turunen&#x27;s voice type is soprano. Over the course of her career, Turunen has developed a vocal range of three and a half octaves. In regards to her voice, Turunen has stated:

==Reception and legacy==
Turunen&#x27;s voice is described by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who do not like classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.

Until the end of their collaboration, Turunen&#x27;s singing was a trademark of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish&#x27;s success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and apply that vocal style to a metal band.

Turunen receives most of her media attention in Europe, especially in her home of Finland. In December 2003, she was invited by Finnish president Tarja Halonen to celebrate Finnish Independence Day at the Presidential Palace together with other Finnish celebrities. The event is televised annually live by the state-owned broadcaster, the Finnish Broadcasting Company. In December 2007, she performed different versions of the Finnish national anthem &quot;Maamme&quot; (Finnish: &quot;Our country&quot;) accompanied by the Tapiola Sinfonietta, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Finnish independence. The concert was televised by the Finnish Broadcasting Company for 2 million Finnish viewers. In December 2013, Turunen was the invited soloist at the Christmas Peace event in the Turku Cathedral, Finland, with the presence of Finnish president Sauli Niinistö. The concert aired on Yle TV1 at the Christmas Eve. During her solo career, Turunen has sold over 100,000 certified records in Finland, which places her among the top 50 of best-selling female soloists.

In Europe, her popularity is mainly limited to the hard rock and metal scene. She had a broader exposure on 30 November 2007, when she was invited to open the farewell fight of Regina Halmich. Her performance of &quot;I Walk Alone&quot; was televised live by the German television station ZDF for 8.8 million viewers. Turunen was one of the star coaches in the fourth season of &quot;The Voice of Finland&quot; in the spring of 2015 on Nelonen. After the success of the 2015 edition of &quot;The Voice of Finland&quot;, Tarja was again chosen to be one of the star coaches for the 2016 edition. In 2016 in honor of the Day of the Finnish Identity, celebrated on May 12, Finland published a new set of official emojis, which symbolizes Finnish culture and history - among other iconic Finnish imagery there were music related emojis, including Tarja Turunen as &quot;The Voice&quot;.

==Personal life==
Turunen married Argentine businessman Marcelo Cabuli on 31 December 2002 – their wedding was celebrated in July 2003; they lived in Buenos Aires with their daughter who was born in 2012. In an interview, Tarja explained that in 2016 they had plans to move back to Europe due to her touring schedule and that their daughter was starting school in the coming year. She currently lives in the south of Spain. In October 2021, she revealed that she had a stroke three years earlier after a U.S. tour.

Tarja fluently speaks Finnish, English, Spanish and German.

<doc id="1003982" wikidata="Q1262529" url="?curid=1003982" title="Dual-use technology">
<text>In politics, diplomacy and export control, dual-use items refer to goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications.

More generally speaking, dual-use can also refer to any goods or technology which can satisfy more than one goal at any given time. Thus, expensive technologies originally benefitting only military purposes would in the future also be used to serve civilian commercial interests if they were not otherwise engaged, such as the Global Positioning System developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The &quot;dual-use dilemma&quot; was first noted with the discovery of the process for synthesizing and mass-producing ammonia which revolutionized agriculture with modern fertilizers but also led to the creation of chemical weapons during World War I. The dilemma has long been known in chemistry and physics, and has led to international conventions and treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

== Drones ==
UAVs are considered to be a challenge for military. No drone zones are areas where drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) cannot be operated.

== Missiles ==

Originally developed as weapons during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union spent billions of dollars developing rocket technology which could carry humans into space (and eventually to the Moon). The development of this peaceful rocket technology paralleled the development of intercontinental ballistic missile technology; and was a way of demonstrating to the other side the potential of one&#x27;s own rockets.

Those who seek to develop ballistic missiles may claim that their rockets are for peaceful purposes; for example, for commercial satellite launching or scientific purposes. However, even genuinely peaceful rockets may be converted into weapons and provide the technological basis to do so.

Within peaceful rocket programs, different peaceful applications can be seen as having parallel military roles. For example, the return of scientific payloads safely to earth from orbit would indicate re-entry vehicle capability and demonstrating the ability to launch multiple satellites with a single launch vehicle can be seen in a military context as having the potential to deploy multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles.

== Nuclear ==
Dual-use nuclear technology refers to the possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that several stages of the nuclear fuel cycle allow diversion of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to the atomic bomb or a public annex to a secret bomb program. The crisis over Iran&#x27;s nuclear activities is a case in point.

Many UN and US agencies warn that building more nuclear reactors unavoidably increases nuclear proliferation risks. A fundamental goal for American and global security is to minimize the proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power. If this development is &quot;poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous&quot;. For nuclear power programs to be developed and managed safely and securely, it is important that countries have domestic “good governance” characteristics that will encourage proper nuclear operations and management:

These characteristics include low degrees of corruption (to avoid officials selling materials and technology for their own personal gain as occurred with the A.Q. Khan smuggling network in Pakistan), high degrees of political stability (defined by the World Bank as “likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including motivated violence and terrorism”), high governmental effectiveness scores (a World Bank aggregate measure of “the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures [and] the quality of policy formulation and implementation”), and a strong degree of regulatory competence.
== Artificial intelligence ==
As more advances are made towards artificial intelligence (AI), it garners more and more attention on its capability as a dual-use technology and the security risks it may pose. Artificial intelligence can be applied within many different fields and can be easily integrated throughout current technology&#x27;s cyberspace. With the use of AI, technology has become capable of running multiple algorithms that could solve difficult problems, from detecting anomalies in samples during MRI scans, to providing surveillance of an entire country&#x27;s residents. Within China&#x27;s mass surveillance, the government uses AI in order to distinguish citizens with less than satisfactory records among crowds. Every new invention or application made with AI comes with its own set of positive and negative effects. Some claim that, as potential uses for AI grow in number, nations need to start regulating it as a dual-use technology.

== Chemical ==

The modern history of chemical weapons can be traced back to the chemical industries of the belligerent nations of World War I, especially that of Germany. Many industrial chemical processes produce toxic intermediary stages, final products, and by-products, and any nation with a chemical industry has the potential to create weaponised chemical agents. Chlorine is a chemical agent found within several household items such as Bleach and provides various benefits with its wide array of applications. However, its gaseous form can also be used as a chemical weapon.

== Biological ==

That the July 2007 terrorist attacks in central London and at Glasgow airport may have involved National Health Service medical professionals was a recent wake-up call that people with access to pathogens may be necessary. The challenge remains to maintain security without impairing the contributions to progress afforded by research.

Reports from the project on building a sustainable culture in dual-use bioethics suggest that, as a result of perceived changes in both science and security over the past decade, several states and multilateral bodies have underlined the importance of making life scientists aware of concerns over dual-use and the legal obligations underpinning the prevention of biological weapons. One of the key mechanisms that have been identified to achieve this is through the education of life science students, with the objective of building what has been termed a “culture of responsibility”.

At the 2008 Meeting of States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), it was agreed by consensus that: States Parties recognized the importance of ensuring that those working in the biological sciences are aware of their obligations under the convention and relevant national legislation and guidelines...States Parties noted that formal requirements for seminars, modules or courses, including possible mandatory components, in relevant scientific and engineering training programmes and continuing professional education could assist in raising awareness and in implementing the convention.

The World Health Organization in 2010 developed a &quot;guidance document&quot; for what it called &quot;Dual Use Research of Concern&quot; (DURC) in the life sciences, regarding “research that is intended [to] benefit, but which might easily be misapplied to do harm&quot;.

Along with several similar stipulations from other states and regional organisations, biosecurity education has become more important. Unfortunately, both the policy and academic literature show that life scientists across the globe are frequently uninformed or underinformed about biosecurity, dual-use, the BTWC and national legislation outlawing biological weapons. Moreover, despite numerous declarations by states and multilateral organisations, the extent to which statements at the international level have trickled down to multifaceted activity at the level of scientists remains limited.

The US federal government (USG) developed several policy documents on DURC. In May 2024, the White House published the &quot;United States Government Policy for Oversight of Dual Use Research of Concern and Pathogens with Enhanced Pandemic Potential&quot;, &quot;a unified federal oversight framework for conducting and managing certain types of federally funded life sciences research on biological agents and toxins.&quot; The policy superseded several prior documents, published in 2012, 2014, and 2017, and it follows the directives established by the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan.

== Night vision and thermal imaging ==
Night-vision devices with extraordinary performance characteristics (high gain, specific spectral sensitivity, fine resolution, low noise) are heavily export-restricted by the few states capable of producing them, mainly to limit their proliferation to enemy combatants, but also to slow the inevitable reverse-engineering undertaken by other world powers.

These precision components, such as the image intensifiers used in night vision goggles and the focal plane arrays found in surveillance satellites and thermal cameras, have numerous civil applications which include nature photography, medical imaging, firefighting, and population control of predator species.

Night scenes of wild elephants and rhinos in the BBC nature documentary series Africa were shot on a Lunax Starlight HD camera (a custom-built digital cinema rig encompassing a Generation 3 image intensifier), and recolored digitally.

In the United States, civilians are free to buy and sell American-made night vision and thermal systems, such as those manufactured by defense contractors Harris, L3 Insight, and FLIR Systems, with very few restrictions. However, American night vision owners may not bring the equipment out of the country, sell it internationally, or even invite non-citizens to examine the technology, per International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

Export of American image intensifiers is selectively permitted under license by the United States Department of Commerce and the State Department. Contributing factors in acquiring a license include diplomatic relations with the destination country, number of pieces to be sold, and the relative quality of the equipment itself, expressed using a Figure Of Merit (FOM) score calculated from several key performance characteristics.

Competing international manufacturers (European defense contractor Exosens Group, Japanese scientific instrument giant Hamamatsu Photonics, and Russian state-financed laboratory JSC Katod) have entered the American market through licensed importers. In spite of their foreign origin, re-export of these components outside of the United States is restricted similarly to domestic components.

A 2012 assessment of the sector by the Department of Commerce and Bureau of Industry and Security made the case for relaxing export controls in light of the narrowing performance gap and increased competition internationally, and a review period undertaken by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in 2015 introduced much more granular performance definitions.

== Other technologies ==

In addition to obvious dual-use technologies there are some less obvious ones, in that many erstwhile peaceful technologies can be used in weapons. One example during the First and Second World War is the role of German toy manufacturers: Germany was one of the leading nations in the production of wind-up toys, and the ability to produce large numbers of small and reliable clockwork motors was converted into the ability to produce shell and bomb fuzes. During its early stages of release, the PlayStation 2 was considered to be a dual-use technology. The gaming console had to receive special import regulations before being shipped towards the U.S. and European markets. This is due to the console&#x27;s and its included GPU&#x27;s capability to process high quality images at high speeds, a shared trait with missile guidance systems.

=== HoloLens 2 ===

Early 2019, Microsoft announced the HoloLens 2, smart glasses that will allow consumers to experience augmented reality within the real world. However, it was revealed Microsoft made a 479 million dollar deal with the U.S. government. This contract would have Microsoft create and supply the U.S. Army a separate version of the HoloLens smart glasses called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). The IVAS would be used to train soldiers, as well as field medics with battlefield experience within a virtual environment. This version of the HoloLens allowed the soldiers to have a virtual map of their current environment, friendly units&#x27; locations, and much more. An anonymous Microsoft employee published an open letter demanding that Microsoft terminate the IVAS contract. Microsoft president Brad Smith had previously made a public blog post outlining the company&#x27;s stance on &quot;how technology companies should work with the government, and specifically whether companies should supply digital technology to the military.&quot;

== Control ==

Most industrial countries have export controls on certain types of designated dual-use technologies, and they are required by a number of treaties as well. These controls restrict the export of certain commodities and technologies without the permission of the government.

In the context of sanctions regimes, dual-use can be construed broadly because there are few things which do not have the potential for both military and civilian uses.

=== United States ===
The principal agency for investigating violations of dual-use export controls in the United States is the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Office of Export Enforcement (OEE). Interagency coordination of export control cases are conducted through the Export Enforcement Coordination Center (E2C2). The International Traffic in Arms Regulations is the US regime that the BIS OEE enforces.

=== Canada ===
The Canadian legislation to govern the trade in dual-use technology is known as the Export and Imports Permits Act.

=== European Union ===
The European Union governs dual-use technology through the Control List of Dual Use Items.

=== International regimes ===
There are several international arrangements among countries which seek to harmonize lists of dual-use (and military) technologies to control. These include the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, which looks at chemical and biological technologies, the Missile Technology Control Regime, which covers delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, and the Wassenaar Arrangement, which covers conventional arms and dual-use technologies.

<doc id="1003989" wikidata="Q8018256" url="?curid=1003989" title="William Sefton Moorhouse">
<text>William Sefton Moorhouse ( 1825 – 15 September 1881) was a British-born New Zealand politician. He was the second Superintendent of Canterbury Province.

==Early life==
Moorhouse was born in Yorkshire, England, and baptised on 18 December 1825; the oldest son of William Moorhouse, a magistrate, and his wife, Ann Carter. He trained as a lawyer, entering as a student at the Middle Temple in November 1847, and was called to the Bar in November 1860. After working for a time in London, he moved to Lyttelton, New Zealand, with his two brothers (Benjamin and Thomas) in 1851. Soon afterwards, he moved to Wellington, where he resumed his law practice.

He married Jane Ann(e) Collins on 15 December 1853 in Old St. Paul&#x27;s, Wellington. He then briefly travelled to Australia, leaving with his wife on the barque &quot;Tory&quot; on 16 December for Melbourne.

He subsequently returned to Lyttelton, and then moved to Christchurch, where he acted as a lawyer, magistrate, newspaper editor, and ship owner. One of his sisters, Sarah Ann Moorhouse, married William Barnard Rhodes. Another, Lucy Ellen Sykes Moorhouse, married John Studholme. Another, Mary Moorhouse, married Thomas Henry Wigley.

==Political career==
Moorhouse was active both in national and provincial politics, and later was a Mayor of Wellington.

===House of Representatives ===





Moorhouse was elected to represent Akaroa in the 1st New Zealand Parliament. He was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1855, the year in which he was first elected to the Canterbury Provincial Council, but retained the seat in a by-election in 1858. By this time he had become the Superintendent for Canterbury in October 1857.

After another defeat in Akaroa in 1860, Moorhouse won the Heathcote by-election in 1862. In the 1866 election, he had won both the Mount Herbert and Westland electorates, and chose to represent the latter. The Westland Representation Act 1867 introduced changes to the Waimea and Westland electorates. Their areas were reassigned and four electorates formed. As a result, Westland was abolished in 1867, a new electorate (Westland Boroughs) was established, and the Act stipulated that the sitting member (Moorhouse) was transferred to it. Other new electorates, for which by-elections were to be held, were Westland North and Westland South. Moorhouse resigned from Westland Boroughs on 20 February 1868, and William Henry Harrison won the resulting by-election.

Moorhouse represented from the to the . He stood unsuccessfully for in the . At the 21 December 1875 election, he stood in the City of Christchurch electorate for the 6th New Zealand Parliament and was returned in third position in this three-member electorate; the other members returned in the election were Edward Richardson and Edward Cephas John Stevens.

Finally he stood successfully for at the which he held until his death in 1881.
=== Canterbury Provincial Council ===
In the provincial elections of August 1853, Moorhouse stood in the Akaroa electorate for one of two positions on the Canterbury Provincial Council. There was a draw for second place and the returning officer gave his casting vote to the other candidate, Rev. William Aylmer. A week earlier, Moorhouse had stood in the same electorate for the House of Representatives and had been successful. In 1855, Moorhouse was first elected to the Canterbury Provincial Council. From March to July 1855, he represented the Akaroa electorate on the first Council. He later served as the Province&#x27;s Superintendent after James FitzGerald resigned from the superintendency in October 1857 due to illness. Moorhouse and Joseph Brittan contested the vacancy, and obtained 727 and 352 votes, respectively.

During the 1857 election he supported construction of the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel although both Brittan and FitzGerald thought such a long expensive tunnel too risky for a small colony and favoured a longer rail connection via Sumner with a short tunnel or a horse tramway over Gollans Pass.

He served as Superintendent until February 1863, and another term from May 1866 to May 1868. After his first superintendency, he represented the Kaiapoi electorate as a provincial councillor from March to October 1863, and then represented the Heathcote electorate from February 1864 to May 1866. From 27 October to 17 November 1863, he was a member of the Canterbury Executive Council.

==Later years==
He was Mayor of Wellington in 1875, and died in Wellington on 15 September 1881. He had diabetes, and had had an operation for an abscess. After a funeral in Wellington his body was returned to Christchurch for a funeral and then burial at Riccarton. The Legislative Council adjourned as a mark of respect. A statue to him in Christchurch was proposed.

He was survived by his wife Jane and five children. The children (born from 1859 to 1867) were a son William Harold Sefton, three daughters Alice Jane, Hilda and Jessie, and a child born in 1865 whose name was not recorded on the birth entry.

==Commemoration==
In 1904, the South Belt or South Town Belt in Christchurch was renamed Moorhouse Avenue in honour of the former Superintendent. Each Christchurch Avenue around the central city is named for one of the former Superintendents, and it was thought appropriate to rename the South Belt for Moorhouse, as it was parallel to the railway line and continued via Ferry Road towards the railway tunnel, two projects that were closely linked to Moorhouse. The eastern continuation of the South Belt was called Junction Street or Junction Road, until its intersection with Ferry Road. In 1909, this section was incorporated into Moorhouse Avenue. Julius von Haast named the Moorhouse Range and Sefton Peak in the Southern Alps after Moorhouse. Moorhouse and Sefton Streets in the Wellington suburb of Wadestown are also named for him. A statue of Moorhouse, made by George Anderson Lawson in London in 1885, is located in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens.

<text>The Aero Ae270 Spirit was a single-engine turboprop general utility aircraft that was developed by the Czech aircraft company Aero Vodochody. A prototype made its maiden flight in 2000, with European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Type Certification in 2005 and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification in 2006. No production followed.

== History ==

=== Prototype ===

Design began in the early 1990s. The aircraft&#x27;s configuration was finalized by 1993. In 1997, Aero signed an agreement with AIDC of Taiwan to jointly manufacture and market the aircraft through Ibis Aerospace. The first prototype (0001, OK-EMA) was completed in 2000, and it first flew on July 25, 2000.

The initial design of the aircraft was projected to have an empty weight of , a maximum take-off weight of , and a ceiling of . Five prototypes were planned, two for static and dynamic tests and three for flight tests. The requirements changed and the aircraft was redesigned for greater performance and capabilities, new equipment added, a new engine variant chosen. The second (partial) prototype was used for static tests and the fourth, for fatigue tests. The third prototype (OK-SAR) first flew in 2002. The fifth prototype (OK-LIB) was finished in 2003, with its first flight in February. The sixth prototype (OK-INA) was also finished in 2003. UCL (Czech Civil Aeronautical Institute) added more requirements, which delayed further tests. The first prototype was no longer usable for EASA test flights as changes were significant. A seventh prototype (OK-EVA) was built in 2004.

In 2004, AIDC announced that it would not deliver wings for additional airplanes. Aero Vodochody also had issues with money for certification and some members of upper management at Aero were against the program. Deteriorating flight parameters and Aero management interest led to cancellation of preliminary orders. Aero Vodochody was never able to calculate a production price, mostly because the wing was produced in Taiwan and alternate production in Czech Republic was never envisioned.

In 2004, AIDC announced that its business priorities had shifted from the civil to military aviation. At the same time, Aero Vodochody&#x27;s upper management experienced a similar shift in their business priorities. Aero management&#x27;s declining interest led to the cancellation of eighty advance orders for the Ae270 aircraft.

=== Certification ===

Airworthiness was certified by the Czech Civil Aviation Authority permitting training and aerial work, including commencement of commercial use. EASA certification completed on December the 12th 2005. The FAA certificate was received on 24 February 2006.

=== Programme suspension ===

During 2008 the project was suspended, jigs and tools removed and 3 unfinished fuselages (including fatigue test prototype 0004) were moved to the Air Park Zruč u Plzně museum. In July 2011, Aero Vodochody stated that the Ae-270 Ibis/Spirit program (including know-how, jigs and tools) would be sold to Belarus, where serial production was planned to start in 2015.

Aircraft Integrated Solutions, a British aviation engineering company based in Manchester, announced in August 2016 that it would restart the programme after its intellectual property and rights as well as European and US type certificates were acquired by its parent, Lebanese investment house COPS.

<text>The Museum of Jewish Heritage, located on Edmond J. Safra Plaza in Battery Park City in Manhattan, New York City, is a living memorial to those murdered in The Holocaust. The museum has received more than 2 million visitors since opening in 1997. The mission statement of the museum is &quot;to educate people of all ages and backgrounds about the broad tapestry of Jewish life in the 20th and 21st centuries—before, during, and after the Holocaust.&quot;

The museum&#x27;s building includes two wings: a six-sided building with a pyramid-shaped roof designed to evoke the memory of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and the Robert M. Morgenthau Wing. The six-sided building, opened in 1997, contains the museum&#x27;s core exhibition galleries. The Morgenthau Wing, opened in 2003, contains the museum&#x27;s offices, theater, and classrooms, as well as the Irving Schneider and Family exhibition gallery. Both wings were designed by Roche-Dinkeloo.

==History==
The Museum of Jewish Heritage was incorporated and chartered in 1984, dedicated in 1986, and built between 1994 and 1997 in New York City&#x27;s Battery Park City. The museum&#x27;s $21.5 million building, designed by architect Kevin Roche opened to the public on September 15, 1997. David Altshuler was the founding director of the museum, a position he held from 1984 until December 1999, when he left to become president of the Trust for Jewish Philanthropy.

Between 1946 and the 1960s, government officials lacked interest in building the museum until the American Jewish Community expressed interest and made an intervention for the museum creation; the American Jewish Community&#x27;s interest was catalyzed by the Six-Day War in 1967. The intervention also contributed to the building process delay.

U.S. President Jimmy Carter, with the support of Mayor Ed Koch, proposed placing the national memorial in New York City instead of Washington, D.C., but it was ruled out. Koch&#x27;s appointment of a Task Force on the Holocaust in 1981 was crucial. The Task Force, &quot;which evolved in 1982 to the New York Holocaust Commission,&quot; recommended the creation of a museum. Carter, in 1978, created the President&#x27;s Commission which placed the issue on the US government&#x27;s agenda. The agenda remained present until it became a reality in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s term on 1993.

Before the museum became a realization, there were many political events that occurred that slowed down the museum creation. Political events included debates based on the structure, location, and even other priorities such as a funding crisis. One of the co-chairman wanted to &quot;personalize&quot; the museum building. The museum&#x27;s site, originally proposed to be located within the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, was relocated to Battery Park City in 1986. The funding crisis was when &quot;Black Monday&quot;, which occurred on October 19, 1987, &quot;wiped out&quot; funds of potential donors for the museum as well as dropped real estate prices.

Initially, Koch&#x27;s administration and co-chairmen George Klein were going to obtain the Custom House for the museum. In 1985 Governor Mario Cuomo&#x27;s broker negotiated site change to Battery Park City. Klein and other leaders were enthusiastic about the change since they wanted to create the best museum for the least price. Many plans for the Museum of Jewish Heritage was submitted but they were rejected by City&#x27;s planning authorities.

In 1990, the museum merged with the Center for Holocaust Studies in Brooklyn. Architect Kevin Roche begin designing the museum in 1993. In the same year, Howard J. Rubinstein also joined the museum&#x27;s board.

The New York City Holocaust Memorial Commission, established in 1982, was reincorporated in 1986 as the New York Holocaust Memorial Commission, with Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch, as well as Klein, Robert M. Morgenthau and Manfred Ohrenstein and Peter Cohen as chairmen of its board.
The plans were not completely accomplished in the beginning because the funds were not sufficient to cover the vision, so in the early 2000, the realization took place with the guidance of David Marwell. In 2003, the dedication of the Robert M. Morgenthau wing included auditoria, classrooms, conference center, and a temporary exhibition space.

At an event held at the Museum of Jewish Heritage on January 29, 2017, Elisha Wiesel suggested that protesting against Executive Order 13769 (&quot;Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States&quot;) was part of his father Elie Wiesel&#x27;s legacy.
From 1997 until 2019, the museum had a Core Exhibition which told the story of 20th and 21st century Jewish life from the perspective of those who lived it. Through a rotating collection that included artifacts, photographs, and documentary films, the Core Exhibition placed the Holocaust in the larger context of modern Jewish history. It was organized into three chronological sections: &quot;Jewish Life A Century Ago&quot;, &quot;The War Against the Jews&quot;, and &quot;Jewish Renewal&quot;—each told on a separate floor. It was housed in the museum&#x27;s six-sided building, symbolic of the six points of the Star of David and the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. 

On the morning of January 8, 2021, a Confederate flag was tied to the front door of the museum, less than two days after the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob, some of whom carried Confederate flags into the Capitol building. The discovery of the flag prompted the filing of an aggravated harassment complaint.

In August 2022 Inna Vernikov withdrew her $5,000 donation to the museum for allegedly banning Florida governor Ron DeSantis from their events, though the museum denied banning anyone.

==Exhibitions and Installations==

The museum&#x27;s collection contains more than 30,000 objects relating to Jewish history and The Holocaust. These objects are used in a variety of exhibitions and installations. 

===&quot;Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away&quot; ===
This special exhibition opened in May 2019 and ran until August 30, 2020.

===&quot;Ordinary Treasures: Highlights From The Museum Of Jewish Heritage Collection&quot;===
This exhibition features drawings and everyday items, many of which were donated by the relatives of the original owners. The exhibition shows some aspects of daily life for European Jews under Nazi rule.

===Andy Goldsworthy&#x27;s &quot;Garden of Stones&quot;===
Andy Goldsworthy&#x27;s living memorial garden, his first permanent commission in New York City, opened to the public on September 17, 2003. An eloquent garden plan of trees growing from stone, the garden was planted by the artist, Holocaust survivors, and their families. This contemplative space, meant to be revisited and experienced differently over time as the garden matures, is visible from almost every floor of the museum.

===Gerda III===
Gerda III was a Danish rescue boat used in 1943 to save Jewish refugees by transporting then from Denmark to Sweden. The boat was donated to the museum by the Danish Parliament in 1997 and is on long-term loan to Mystic Seaport. The vessel&#x27;s history is captured in the book &quot;Henny and Her Boat: Righteousness and Resistance in Nazi-Occupied Denmark&quot;.

===Edmond J. Safra Hall===
In the 375-seat Edmond J. Safra Hall, the museum offers a schedule of films, concerts, and panel discussions throughout the year. Past programs have included symposia on the Holocaust, interfaith dialogues, and concerts featuring established and emerging artists.

Over the last few years, the museum has held a day-long symposium on Darfur with policy makers and leaders on human rights; presented performers such as Idan Raichel and David Strathairn; hosted film screenings with actors and directors such as Kirk Douglas, John Turturro, Quentin Tarantino, Claude Lanzmann, and Ed Zwick; explored Justice after the Holocaust with experts like Alan Dershowitz; and hosted the revival of a Yiddish operetta, &quot;Die Goldene Kale&quot;.

=== &quot;Rendering Witness: Holocaust-Era Art as Testimony&quot; ===
This exhibition &quot;features art made during and immediately after the Holocaust by those who lived it,&quot; including art made by prisoners in concentration camps and American liberators. The exhibit is intended to showcase the Holocaust as people saw it during the time. 

==Affiliates==

===JewishGen===
JewishGen is the leading internet site for Jewish genealogy and provides free online access to a vast collection of Jewish ancestral records. JewishGen and the museum affiliated in 2003. JewishGen features over 22 million records (including family trees containing 7 million individuals, 3 million burial records, and 2.75 million Holocaust records), hundreds of translated Yizkor Books, research tools, a family finder, educational classes, and many other constantly updated resources.

===Auschwitz Jewish Center===

In addition to the New York campus, the museum has also been affiliated with the Auschwitz Jewish Center in Oświęcim, Poland, since 2006.

Before the invasion of Poland and later occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany Oświęcim (renamed Auschwitz by the Nazis) was just an ordinary Polish town. The majority of its citizens were Jewish. Following the end of the World War II Auschwitz became the ultimate symbol of the Holocaust. In September 2000, the Auschwitz Jewish Center opened its doors to honor the former residents of the town and to teach future generations about what was lost. Located less than from Auschwitz-Birkenau, it is the only remaining Jewish presence in the town.
The AJC&#x27;s mission is also to provide all visitors with an opportunity to memorialize victims of the Holocaust through the study of the life and culture of a formerly Jewish town and to offer educational programs that allow new generations to explore the meaning and contemporary implications of the Holocaust. The Center provides regularly scheduled exhibitions and educational programs. The United States Service Academy Program takes cadets and midshipmen to Poland for a three-week trip to learn from survivors, scholars, and historians. The Auschwitz Jewish Center Fellows program is a three-and-a-half-week study trip for students who are matriculated in graduate programs or are completing undergraduate degrees.

===National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene===

The National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene is a professional theater company in New York City, founded in 1915, which produces both Yiddish plays and plays translated into Yiddish, in a theater equipped with simultaneous superscript translation into English. The theater company has been in residence at the Museum of Jewish Heritage since 2016.

<text>The dynamic knowledge repository (DKR) is a concept developed by Douglas C. Engelbart as a primary strategic focus for allowing humans to address complex problems. He has proposed that a DKR will enable us to develop a collective IQ greater than any individual&#x27;s IQ. References and discussion of Engelbart&#x27;s DKR concept are available at the Doug Engelbart Institute.

==Definition==
A knowledge repository is a computerized system that systematically captures, organizes and categorizes an organization&#x27;s knowledge. The repository can be searched and data can be quickly retrieved.

The effective knowledge repositories include factual, conceptual, procedural and meta-cognitive techniques. The key features of knowledge repositories include communication forums.

A knowledge repository can take many forms to &quot;contain&quot; the knowledge it holds. A customer database is a knowledge repository of customer information and insights – or electronic explicit knowledge. A Library is a knowledge repository of books – physical explicit knowledge. A community of experts is a knowledge repository of tacit knowledge or experience. The nature of the repository only changes to contain/manage the type of knowledge it holds. A repository (as opposed to an archive) is designed to get knowledge out. It should therefore have some rules of structure, classification, taxonomy, record management, etc., to facilitate user engagement.

<text>Loughlin O&#x27;Brien (23 November 1821 – 17 April 1901), often spelled Laughlin O&#x27;Brien, was a New Zealand politician and judge.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Brien was born in 1821 in Dublin, Ireland, and arrived in New Zealand in 1842. His father was Andrew O&#x27;Brien, who represented the City of Auckland electorate in the Auckland Provincial Council.

He married Hélène Leopoldine Francoise Isabelle De Witte at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Auckland, on 4 February 1856, with the wedding ceremony carried out by Bishop Pompallier. His Belgian-born wife was from Waiheke Island, and her father Charles Antoine Joseph De Witte was the Belgian consul to New Zealand.

==Professional career==
He trained as a solicitor, first under Mr Conroy and then under Frederick Merriman. He was one of the first two solicitors to be submitted to the Supreme Court in 1851 after having trained in New Zealand. In 1856, he was appointed sheriff for the Auckland district. He was registrar of the Supreme Court from 1865 to 1870, when he retired with a pension. In 1880, he was appointed judge at the Native Land Court. He retired from the bench in circa 1899.

==Politics==

O&#x27;Brien represented the City of Auckland electorate in the 1st New Zealand Parliament from 1853 to 1855, when he retired. He did not serve in any subsequent Parliaments. He was returning officer for the for the City of Auckland, , and electorates. He also acted as returning officer for elections to the Auckland Provincial Council, including elections of the Superintendent.

==Death==
O&#x27;Brien resided at St Georges Bay Road, Parnell, and later, at Putiki Bay, Ostend on Waiheke Island. He died at Woodside Private Hospital in Burleigh Street, Auckland, on 17 April 1901 following a long illness. He was buried in Waikaraka Cemetery, Onehunga, Auckland. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.

<doc id="1004014" wikidata="Q474472" url="?curid=1004014" title="Pale Blue Dot">
<text>Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe from an unprecedented distance of over kilometers ( miles, 40.5 AU), as part of that day&#x27;s &quot;Family Portrait&quot; series of images of the Solar System.

In the photograph, Earth&#x27;s apparent size is less than a pixel; the planet appears as a tiny dot against the vastness of space, among bands of sunlight reflected by the camera. Commissioned by NASA and resulting from the advocacy of astronomer and author Carl Sagan, the photograph was interpreted in Sagan&#x27;s 1994 book, &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, as representing humanity&#x27;s minuscule and ephemeral place amidst the cosmos.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was launched on September 5, 1977, with the initial purpose of studying the outer Solar System. After fulfilling its primary mission and as it ventured out of the Solar System, the decision to turn its camera around and capture one last image of Earth emerged, in part due to Sagan&#x27;s proposition. 

Over the years, the photograph has been revisited and celebrated on multiple occasions, with NASA acknowledging its anniversaries and presenting updated versions, enhancing its clarity and detail.

== Background ==
&quot;Voyager 1&quot; is a robotic spacecraft on a mission to study the outer Solar System and eventually interstellar space. After encountering the Jovian system in 1979 and the Saturnian system in 1980, the primary mission was declared complete in November of the same year. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was the first space probe to provide detailed images of the two largest planets and their major moons.
The spacecraft, still traveling at , is the most distant human-made object from Earth and the first to leave the Solar System. Its mission has been extended and continues to this day, with the aim of investigating the boundaries of the Solar System, including the Kuiper belt, the heliosphere and interstellar space. Since its launch, it receives routine commands and transmits data back to the Deep Space Network.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; was expected to work only through the Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, astronomer and author Carl Sagan proposed the idea of the space probe taking one last picture of Earth. He acknowledged that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for &quot;Voyager&quot;″s cameras to make out any detail, but it would be meaningful as a perspective on humanity&#x27;s place in the universe.

Although many in NASA&#x27;s Voyager program were supportive of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth so close to the Sun risked damaging the spacecraft&#x27;s imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan&#x27;s idea was put in motion, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to &quot;Voyager 1&quot; were also being laid off or transferred to other projects. Richard Truly, the then NASA Administrator, interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken. A proposal to continue to photograph Earth as it orbited the Sun was rejected.

== Camera ==
&quot;Voyager 1&quot;″s Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two cameras: a low-resolution wide-angle camera used for spatially extended imaging, and a high-resolution narrow-angle camera intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras are slow-scan vidicon tubes with a selenium sulphur storage surface, and are fitted with eight colored filters mounted on a filter wheel in front of the tube. &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; was taken with the narrow-angle camera, a 1500 mm f/8.5 catadioptric cassegrain telescope whose design was based on the 1973 Mariner mission. 
The challenge was that, as the mission progressed, the objects to be photographed would increasingly be farther away and would appear fainter, requiring longer exposures and slewing (panning) of the cameras to achieve acceptable quality. The telecommunication capability also diminished with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.

After taking the &quot;Family Portrait&quot; series of images, which included &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, NASA mission managers commanded &quot;Voyager 1&quot; to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft was not going to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.

== Photograph ==

The design of the command sequence to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph&#x27;s exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. The command sequence was then compiled and sent to &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, with the images taken at 04:48 GMT on February 14, 1990. At that time, the distance between the spacecraft and Earth was 40.47 astronomical units (6,055 million kilometers, 3,762 million miles).

The data from the camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the &quot;Magellan&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; missions being given priority use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal traveling at the speed of light for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.

Three of the frames received showed the Earth as a tiny point of light in empty space. Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the image that became &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;.
Of the 640,000 individual pixels that compose each frame, Earth takes up less than one (0.12 of a pixel, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight reflecting off parts of the camera and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.

&quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, which was taken with the narrow-angle camera, was also published as part of a composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera&#x27;s vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.

== Pale blue color ==
Earth appears as a blue dot in the photograph primarily because of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in its atmosphere. In Earth&#x27;s air, short-wavelength visible light such as blue light is scattered to a greater extent than longer wavelength light such as red light, which is the reason why the sky appears blue from Earth. (The ocean also contributes to Earth&#x27;s blueness, but to a lesser degree than scattering.) Earth is a &quot;pale&quot; blue dot, rather than dark blue, because white light reflected by clouds combines with the scattered blue light.

Earth&#x27;s reflectance spectrum from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared is unlike that of any other observed planet and is partially due to the presence of life on Earth. Rayleigh scattering, which causes Earth&#x27;s blueness, is enhanced in an atmosphere that does not substantially absorb visible light, unlike, for example, the orange-brown color of Titan, where organic haze particles absorb strongly at blue visible wavelengths. Earth&#x27;s plentiful atmospheric oxygen, which is produced by photosynthetic life forms, oxidizes organics in the atmosphere and converts them to water and carbon dioxide, causing the atmosphere to be transparent to visible light and allowing for substantial Rayleigh scattering and hence stronger reflectance of blue light.

== Reflections ==
In his 1994 book, &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot;, Carl Sagan comments on what he sees as the greater significance of the photograph, writing:

== Anniversaries ==

In 2015, NASA acknowledged the 25th anniversary of the photograph. Ed Stone, Voyager project scientist, commented: &quot;Twenty-five years ago, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; looked back toward Earth and saw a &quot;pale blue dot&quot;, an image that continues to inspire wonderment about the spot we call home.&quot;

In 2020, for the image&#x27;s 30th anniversary, NASA published a new version of the original &quot;Voyager&quot; photo: &quot;Pale Blue Dot Revisited&quot;, obtained using modern image processing techniques &quot;while attempting to respect the original data and intent of those who planned the images.&quot; Brightness levels and colors were rebalanced to enhance the area containing the Earth, and the image was enlarged, appearing brighter and less grainy than the original. The direction of the Sun is toward the bottom, where the image is brightest.

To celebrate the same occasion, the Carl Sagan Institute released a video with several noted astronomers reciting Sagan&#x27;s &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; speech.

<text>The Honourable James O&#x27;Neill (1819–1882) was born in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, Ireland. In Ireland, he trained as an apothecary but then emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in 1840. There, he became a significant 19th-century politician.

== New Zealand ==


O&#x27;Neill was first elected to the Auckland provincial council in July 1853, representing the City of Auckland. That same year O&#x27;Neill was elected as a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1st Parliament, the 3rd Parliament and the 4th Parliament. He represented two different Auckland seats. First, he was the member of the City of Auckland from 1853 until he was defeated in 1855. He then represented the Northern Division (the area between Auckland and Whangārei) from 1861 to 1869.

In 1862, O&#x27;Neill and his oldest child Mary O&#x27;Neill were passengers on the SS &quot;White Swan&quot; together with the prime minister and several other senior members of the New Zealand government. The ship was holed by a rock while steaming from Napier to Wellington and began sinking. Captain Allen Harper deliberately ran the ship aground and thereby saved the lives of all those on board.

O&#x27;Neill resigned his House of Representatives seat in 1869 and was appointed a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council, the Upper House of the New Zealand Parliament. In addition to serving in both houses of the New Zealand Parliament, O&#x27;Neill was also a founding director of the Bank of New Zealand, and a justice of the peace.

== Later life ==
He resigned his Legislative Council seat in 1872 and returned to the British Isles where he died at Southsea, England, in 1882 aged 65

<text>SS &quot;Albert Ballin was an [[ocean liner]] of the [[Hamburg-America Line]] launched in 1923 and named after [[Albert Ballin]], the visionary director of the Hamburg-America line, who had committed suicide several years earlier. In 1935, the ship was renamed Hansa&quot; on orders from the German government. Towards the end of World War II, she was employed to evacuate civilians during Operation Hannibal, and sank after hitting a mine. She was later raised and refitted by the Soviet Union and was finally scrapped in 1982.

==History==

===Hamburg America Line===
 &quot;Albert Ballin&quot; was built by Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg, and served on the Hamburg-New York City route. In 1928, a tourist class was added. Originally built as a 16 knot ship, the engines were replaced in 1929, resulting in a speed of 19 knots. In 1934, she was lengthened by 50 feet, and speed increased again, this time to 21.5 knots.

In 1935, the new Nazi government ordered the ship be renamed Hansa (Ballin having been Jewish). &quot;Hansa&#x27;s&quot; last Atlantic crossing was in 1939. 

In 1945, she was employed to evacuate civilians from Gotenhafen during Operation Hannibal, and was due to accompany the overloaded MV Wilhelm Gustloff leaving midday on 30 January, but suffered mechanical problems before the ships had left the Bay of Danzig and had to anchor. Later, on 6 March during a further evacuation, she hit a mine off Warnemünde and slowly sank.
===Soviet Union===
The wreck was raised and rebuilt by the Soviet Union around 1949, and renamed &quot;Sovetskiy Soyuz&quot; (; meaning Soviet Union), becoming the largest passenger ship operating under the Soviet flag. From 1955, she operated between Vladivostok and points in the Far East. Renamed &quot;Tobolsk&quot; () in 1980, she sailed under that name for almost two years before being scrapped.

<text>Carlos Manuel Bocanegra (born May 25, 1979) is an American sports executive and former professional soccer player. A two-time MLS Defender of the Year, Bocanegra also played professionally in England, Scotland, France, and Spain. He earned over 100 caps with the United States, serving as captain for six years. He most recently served as technical director and vice president for Atlanta United.

==Early life and education==
Bocanegra was born in Upland, CA on May 25, 1979, to Manuel and Kelly Bocanegra. He was raised in Alta Loma, Rancho Cucamonga, California, where he attended Alta Loma High School. He has one brother, Diego, who played soccer at Grand Canyon University, UCLA and Fresno State. Diego is currently the head coach of the University of Houston women&#x27;s soccer team. His father is of Mexican descent. While attending UCLA, Bocanegra studied history and geography. Prior to attending UCLA, Bocanegra was offered scholarships for American football but opted for soccer, which he thought of choosing as his career. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Club career==
=== Chicago Fire ===
After playing college soccer at UCLA, Bocanegra signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer and was drafted by the Chicago Fire with the fourth overall pick in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft. He spent most of the year with the Fire, playing two games on loan with Project 40. He won the MLS Rookie of the Year Award for a team that made it to the MLS Championship match and won the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. He became one of the top defenders in MLS, becoming the first player to win the MLS Defender of the Year Award twice, in 2002 and 2003. Bocanegra scored five goals and had eight assists in his four years in MLS.

=== Fulham ===
Bocanegra was signed by Fulham in January 2004, quickly becoming a fan favorite, garnering the nicknames &quot;the Jackal&quot; and &quot;the Black Snake&quot;. With Fulham, Bocanegra played primarily as a center back, but also as a left back and briefly as a holding midfielder. During the 2006–07 Premier League season, he was Fulham&#x27;s second leading scorer with five goals, behind fellow American Brian McBride. On September 1, 2007, Bocanegra captained Fulham for the first time in a Premier League match, a come from behind 3–3 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. On September 15, 2007, he made his 100th appearance in the Premier League, all for Fulham, against Wigan Athletic. He was released by Fulham on May 23, 2008.

=== Rennes ===
Bocanegra was signed by Rennes in June 2008. He received the number 3 shirt, which is his number for the United States. Bocanegra performed well in his first season in France, appearing in all 38 league matches. He scored his first league goal on March 8, 2009, in Stade Rennais&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Auxerre. He also scored a goal in a UEFA Cup match and started all the club&#x27;s Coupe de France matches. These included the 2009 Coupe de France Final at the Stade de France on May 9, 2009, where he scored Stade Rennais&#x27; first goal against Guingamp, in the 70th -1 minute.

=== Saint-Étienne ===
On July 16, 2010, Bocanegra was purchased by fellow Ligue 1 club Saint-Étienne for a reported fee of £400,000. He wore the number three shirt, as he did captaining the U.S. during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Bocanegra made his debut for the club, on the opening game of the season, in a 3–1 loss against PSG. On December 5, 2010, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2–2 draw against Bordeaux; followed up his second goal in the Derby du Rhône, but couldn&#x27;t help Saint-Étienne win, as they lost 4–1. Bocanegra would be often used in first-team ins and outs in his first season. In a match against Nice, on October 17, 2010, Bocanegra suffered whiplash injury, that kept him out for three weeks.

In the 2011–12 season, Bocanegra took the captaincy temporarily following Loïc Perrin&#x27;s absence, on the opening game of the season, as Saint-Étienne win 2–1 against Bordeaux. This turned out to be his only appearance. He was linked with a move to Rangers, but was warned by Saint-Étienne that they would not sell him.

=== Rangers ===
On August 17, 2011, Bocanegra joined Scottish Premier League side Rangers, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Bocanegra made his debut for Rangers against NK Maribor on August 18, 2011, in a UEFA Europa League qualifier. His involvement in this match later caused controversy when Maribor filed a complaint to UEFA regarding the eligibility of Bocanegra&#x27;s appearance, questioning whether he had the required clearance and paperwork. The protest was rejected by UEFA on August 24 as Maribor did not submit it within twenty-four hours of the match. The club&#x27;s chief later described the complaint by Maribor regarding Bocanegra&#x27;s eligibility as &#x27;pathetic mischief making&#x27;. He scored his first goal for Rangers in the second leg of the Maribor tie as Rangers crashed out 3–2 on aggregate.

Bocanegra scored his first league goal for the club on September 24 against Dunfermline Athletic in a 4–0 win. His second goal came three months later, on December 17, 2011, during a 2–1 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Bocanegra quickly became a fan favorite after a series of solid and impressive performances alongside his center-back partner, Dorin Goian. He was nicknamed Captain America by the Rangers fans and captained Rangers for the first time on January 8, 2012, during a 4–0 win over Arbroath in the Scottish Cup.

During the season, Rangers went into administration over financial problems and a dispute with HMRC, leading to a 10-point deduction. Bocanegra spoke about the event, describing it as a &quot;horrible experience&quot; and encouraging players to light up the dejected fans. He also stated his desire to stay at the club, insisting he was happy there. During an Old Firm 3–2 victory, on March 25, 2012, Bocanegra received a straight red card after fouling Georgios Samaras, conceding a penalty.

After Rangers FC went into administration, in June 2012 the company&#x27;s assets, including the players&#x27; contracts, were purchased by Charles Green&#x27;s consortium. Although many players departed because of this, Bocanegra&#x27;s future was uncertain after not attending training, as he wanted to leave in order to play at a higher level. A few weeks later, on July 29, 2012, McCoist appointed Bocanegra captain for the first round of the Challenge Cup- a 2–1 win over Brechin City. After the game Bocanegra announced his intention to stay, vowing not to walk away from the club. He then made six appearances at the start of the season. After being dropped by the national team, Bocanegra joined Racing de Santander on a season-long loan in an attempt to keep his international career alive.

=== Racing Santander ===
On August 31, 2012, Bocanegra joined Spanish Segunda División side Racing Santander on a season-long loan. Bocanegra expressed a desire to return to Rangers once his loan deal has expired.
He made his debut for the club, on September 22, 2012, in a 1–0 win over CD Mirandés. 
However, his time at Santander was considered &quot;disastrous&quot;, as he failed to start the remainder of the matches, though still played regularly, coming on as a substitute. The club was relegated to next division.

On April 9, 2013, Carlos announced on his Twitter page that he would return to Rangers for the 2013–14 season. Though announcing his return, U.S. National Team Coach Jürgen Klinsmann warned Carlos not to play for Rangers next season.

=== Chivas USA ===
In the summer of 2013, Bocanegra left Rangers and signed with Chivas USA. Chivas USA traded up the allocation order with Toronto FC to land his signature, sending a first-round 2015 MLS SuperDraft pick and an international slot to the Canadian club.

Bocanegra retired at the end of the 2014 MLS season.

==International career==
Bocanegra played for the United States at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship and earned his first senior cap for the U.S. on December 9, 2001, against South Korea. He became a stalwart for the team in 2003, solidifying his position during the 2003 Gold Cup and leading all defenders with thirteen appearances during that year. During World Cup qualification in 2005, his role with the national team became less clear, as he bounced between roles at center back and left back. On May 2, 2006, Bocanegra was named to the United States World Cup roster for the tournament in Germany. He started two of three games at left back during the 2006 World Cup.

Bocanegra was first-choice captain of the U.S. squad under manager Bob Bradley. Bocanegra captained the national team for the first time in a 4–1 U.S. victory in a June 2, 2007, friendly against China. Bocanegra captained the United States national team that defeated No. 1 ranked Spain to win one of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup semi-final games on June 24, 2009. He then continued his leadership duties throughout the 2010 FIFA World Cup, starting at left back against England and Slovenia and then as the left-center back against Algeria and Ghana.

On November 15, 2011, Bocanegra joined the 100 cap club achieving his 100th international cap in a friendly against Slovenia. In March 2013, Bocanegra was initially included on the preliminary team for the start of the final stage of World Cup qualification; however, he did not make the final team. Bocanegra&#x27;s further exclusion from qualification, in part due to his unstable club situation, led to the appointment of Clint Dempsey as captain of the USMNT. Bocanegra was subsequently not a part of the team at the 2013 Gold Cup or the 2014 World Cup.

==Post-playing career==
Bocanegra was appointed technical director of Atlanta United in March 2015. In October 2017, he signed a new four-year contract with the club, which also added the title of vice president to his role. The club announced he was leaving on September 4, 2024.

He was appointed to co-chair the Technical Development Committee at U.S. Soccer in April 2018.

In September 2020, Bocanegra was elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

<text>Joseph Tracy (1793–1874) was a Protestant Christian minister, newspaper editor, historian and leading figure in the American Colonization Society of the early to mid-19th century. He is noted as a typical figure of the New England Renaissance.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Tracy was born November 3, 1793, in Hartford, Vermont, as the eldest child of Joseph and Ruth Carter Tracy. By his own account, he &quot;was a farmer&#x27;s boy and student alternately, or sometimes both at once,&quot; until he graduated with a Master of Arts from Dartmouth College in 1814, after election to Phi Beta Kappa society. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was awarded him by the University of Vermont in 1859, after he had won his fame.

==Early career==
Like many other college graduates of his day, he first supported himself by teaching. In 1817, he was chosen as principal of Royalton Academy in Vermont. In a letter of recommendation it was said of him &quot;I know him to be one of the best linguists and classical scholars in general who have been this number of years at Dartmouth College. . .You will find him to be not a fine gentleman nor a showy pedagogue but a useful instructor.&quot; It was there he met his first wife, Eleanor Washburn, whom he married in 1819. An admirer of educated women, he taught her Latin and began Greek, until the demands of family life cut short her studies. At this time, he also began the study of law.

==Later life and work==
However, he gave up the law for the ministry, studying under Asa Burton of Thetford, Vermont, and was admitted to the ministry of the Congregational Churches on June 26, 1821. From 1821 to 1828 he held the pastorates of two churches in villages near Thetford, but by the latter year it became apparent that his true work lay in a different branch of church activities. He was appointed in the autumn of 1828 to take the editorship of the &quot;Vermont Chronicle&quot;, an organ of the Vermont Congregational Churches, which had been founded in 1826 by his younger brother, Ebenezer Carter Tracy. In 1834, he again exchanged positions with his brother, becoming editor of the &quot;Boston Recorder&quot;. He also served for a short time in 1837 as editor of the &quot;New York Observer&quot;. During and after this time he published several books, including: &quot;The Three Last Things&quot;, 1839, an essay on resurrection, judgment and final retribution; &quot;The Great Awakening&quot;, 1842, a history of the religious revival in America in the mid to late 18th century (some scholars attribute the well-known name of that movement to Rev. Tracy&#x27;s work); and &quot;The History of the Missions of the American Board&quot;, 1842.

Tracy had eight children with his first wife, Eleanor, who died in 1836. He remarried in 1842 to Sarah Prince. In his later years, he was cared for by his wife and two unmarried daughters. He was the guardian of his granddaughter, Martha Tracy Owler. He died in his home in Beverly, Massachusetts, on March 24, 1874, after a short illness.

==Views and affiliations==
Tracy&#x27;s theological views were absolutely orthodox for his denomination, even puritan in outlook. However, in a time of extreme turbulence in his church, his tolerance was notable. Tradition within the Tracy family suggests that he assisted Samuel F. B. Morse with the development of the Morse code when in New York, despite Morse&#x27;s well-known unorthodox ideas. Although this is mere tradition, Tracy did have a reputation as a man with an extraordinarily extensive fund of knowledge in varied fields. The story is told that a friend was talking to another about a certain type of copper found in England. The friend said &quot;Mr. Tracy could tell you if he was here!&quot; and then looking up, saw him. The friend couldn’t resist. &quot;Mr. Tracy, what is Bungtown Copper?&quot; Tracy replied that it was an expression shortened from Birmingham Copper and proceeded to go into a deep explanation of the meaning of the term.

From his college days, Tracy was closely associated with the New England group who were leaders in the development of political feeling in the north, most notably Rufus Choate and Daniel Webster, both fellow Dartmouth graduates. In 1842, he began his life work as secretary of the Massachusetts Colonization Society, an affiliate of the American Colonization Society, a position he held until his death in 1874. He became a director of the parent society in 1858 and attended the annual meetings at the Washington headquarters. The &quot;Memorial of the Semi-Centennial Anniversary of the American Colonization Society,&quot; published 1867, contains a historical account by him of the work of the society.

These Societies, which arose in several states including the South, beginning in 1817, undertook to solve, or alleviate, the slavery question by acquiring freedom for black slaves and transporting them by ship back to Africa. In actuality, the motives of the colonization supporters were mixed—many supporters were no abolitionists, but instead wanted to be rid of the free Negro population. By the time Tracy began his work, it was clear that large-scale colonization was a failure and that much of the movement was discredited.

Tracy&#x27;s did not view Liberia as a mere convenient place for an inconvenient population. Besides sincere anti-slavery views, he saw African colonization as a way of Christian mission. He also had an important influence in the founding of the college at Liberia and bringing it into successful operation.

Tracy was in some ways a typical figure in the period of American history known as the New England Renaissance. His upbringing and inclination looked back to the Pilgrim fathers—he called Christmas a heathen holiday, yet never interfered with his family&#x27;s celebration of it—but his education and tolerance heralded the beginnings of a more modern sensibility.

<text>The MLS Young Player of the Year Award (known as the Rookie of the Year Award from 1996 to 2019) is an annual award given to the top player in Major League Soccer under the age of 22. 

The award was initially awarded to a rookie, or a player who no prior professional experience, usually to players that had previously played in MLS youth team academies or played college soccer. This practice is fairly common in other American sports leagues, such as the MLB Rookie of the Year (baseball), NASCAR Rookie of the Year (motorsports), NFL Rookie of the Year Award (American football), the Eddie Gottlieb Trophy (basketball), and the Calder Memorial Trophy (ice hockey).

In 2020, MLS replaced the Rookie of the Year Award with the MLS Young Player of the Year Award, given to the best player in the league aged 22 and under, regardless of prior professional playing experience.
