After more than a decade of decline, he made a career comeback by reprising his role in &quot;Gadar 2&quot; (2023), which became the highest-grossing film of his career and the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film at the time.

== Early life and education==
Deol was born as Ajay Singh Deol on 19 October 1957, in the village of Sahnewal in East Punjab, India, in a Punjabi Jat family, to Bollywood actor Dharmendra and Prakash Kaur. Growing up, he was a mischievous child and was often slapped by his mother for misbehaviour. Despite this, he had a good childhood and felt loved by her. He was afraid of his father, whom he respected and held in high regard, and remained obedient to him.

Deol completed his schooling at Sacred Heart Boys High School in Mumbai, and pursued higher education at Ramniranjan Anandilal Poddar College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai. Deol has publicly admitted to having dyslexia, which caused difficulties with reading and writing in school. But he excelled in sports and co-curricular activities. In college, Deol was a quarrelsome student as he used to get into lots of fights and beat people. He used to carry metal rods and hockey sticks in his car for protection. He also engaged in street races and made modifications to his car. He wanted to pursue car racing as a career but was denied by his family.

After completing college, he went on to study theatre. He attended the renowned Old Rep Theatre in Birmingham. There he performed stage shows and returned to India to make his film debut. He was admitted based on a personal recommendation from Shashi Kapoor.

== Acting career ==
=== 1983–1984: Breakthrough with romantic roles===
Deol made his debut with the 1983 romantic film &quot;Betaab&quot; which earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Produced by father Dharmendra and directed by Rahul Rawail, the film follows the story of two young lovers, played by Deol and Amrita Singh, navigating obstacles to their love amidst family conflicts and class divide. The plot of the film was loosely based on William Shakespeare’s &quot;The Taming Of The Shrew&quot;. The film emerged as a commercial success and went on to be one of the biggest hits of the year, emerging as the second highest-grossing Indian film of 1983. Betaab turned Deol and co-star Singh into overnight sensations. The music by R. D. Burman, also played a significant role as the song ‘&quot;Jab Hum Jawan Honge&quot;&#x27; was a chartbuster. Hajan Valley located in Kashmir, a major location in the film came to be known as Betaab Valley, which has since become a popular tourist destination in the region.

The following year, Deol starred in &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;Manzil Manzil&quot;, and &quot;Sohni Mahiwal&quot;, with only the latter becoming successful at the box office. &quot;Sohni Mahiwal&quot; (1984), an Indian-Russian film portrays the classic Punjabi folklore tragic love story of Sohni, portrayed by Poonam Dhillon, a potter&#x27;s daughter, and Mahiwal (Deol), a wealthy merchant, amidst societal constraints. The film remains celebrated for its soundtrack and has attained cult classic status in Russia.

=== 1985–1989: Early success in action-drama===
Deol broadened his range by appearing in Rahul Rawail&#x27;s action film &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985), in which he played the titular role of an unemployed radical youth who, along with his friends, fights against the corrupt and exploitative system. The critically acclaimed film became a major hit, and established Deol&#x27;s status as an action hero. &quot;Arjun&quot; is considered one of Deol&#x27;s best works to date.

In 1986, he appeared alongside his father for the first time in the epic adventure &quot;Sultanat&quot;. The film, however, did not perform well at the box office, despite high production values. Deol starred in a series of commercially successful action films in the late 1980s. In &quot;Dacait&quot; (1987), he portrayed a man driven to rebellion after his family is killed due to feudal oppression. His intense and emotionally resonant performance was praised, despite the film&#x27;s grim tone. In &quot;Paap Ki Duniya&quot; (1988), Deol portrayed a criminal raised by a crime lord. His character, caught between his upbringing and his conscience, added complexity to the action driven narrative. That same year, he starred in the western &quot;Yateem&quot; (1988), directed by J. P. Dutta, playing an orphan facing ostracism for his stepson status. 

In &quot;Vardi&quot; (1989), he played a cop trying to dismantle a crime syndicate. He also headlined Rajiv Rai&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Tridev&quot; (1989), playing a suspended police officer framed for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit. The film, a major success and the third-highest-grossing of 1989, received several awards and revitalised the multi-starrer genre in the industry. His performance, alongside Jackie Shroff, Naseeruddin Shah, and Madhuri Dixit, was well-received by audiences and critics alike. Deol took on a lighter role in &quot;ChaalBaaz&quot; (1989), a slapstick comedy film starring Sridevi in a dual role alongside Rajinikanth. The film was a commercial success and became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. This period firmly established Deol as a prominent action star in Hindi cinema, leading to a series of high-profile roles in the following decade.

===1990–2003: Established action star===
Deol starred as a boxer in &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), directed by debutant Rajkumar Santoshi; for which he received widespread critical acclaim. The film became the year&#x27;s second highest-grossing film worldwide and the highest-grossing film domestically. The film grossed and was declared a &quot;blockbuster&quot; by &quot;Box Office India&quot;. The film won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor and the National Film Award – Special Jury Award (Feature Film). The success of the film established Deol as a bonafide box office draw and the film recorded a large repeat audience. &quot;Ghayal&quot; was rereleased many times throughout the 90s and grossed several times more than its original run, with many theatres showing it to packed houses. It is the second most successful Indian film in repeat runs, behind only &quot;Sholay&quot;.

Due to the overwhelming success of &quot;Ghayal&quot;, Deol enjoyed a very successful period throughout the 90s. From 1991 to 2001, he delivered back-to-back successes. Starting with &quot;Yodha&quot; in 1991 in which he co-starred alongside Sanjay Dutt. It received mostly average reviews and earned ₹12.95 crore against a budget of ₹2.85 crore. The same year, &quot;Narsimha&quot; was another success and emerged as the 8th highest grossing Indian film of 1991.

In 1992, he appeared in his only release &quot;Vishwatma&quot;. The film received critical acclaim upon release from contemporary as well as modern critics, with praise drawn towards its screenplay and action sequences. It earned over in its total theatrical run worldwide and was the sixth highest-grossing Indian film of 1992. It proved to be a major launchpad for Chunky Pandey as well as for debutanté Divya Bharti.

1993 was a noteworthy year for Deol as he starred in four major films of the year: &quot;Lootere&quot;, &quot;Kshatriya&quot;, &quot;Damini&quot; and &quot;Darr&quot;. &quot;Lootere&quot; was an action film where Deol played a cop investing the murder of his colleague with the help of a bar dancer. It ranked among the biggest hits of that year. &quot;Kshatriya&quot; featured a star cast of Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt, Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Rakhee Gulzar, Meenakshi Seshadri, Raveena Tandon and Divya Bharti. Released worldwide on 26 March 1993, it recorded a record-breaking opening at the box office. Although it was well received by both critics and audiences, the film was banned from theatres due to Sanjay Dutt&#x27;s involvement in 1993 Bombay bombings case.

Also in 1993, Deol reunited with Rajkumar Santoshi to play an alcoholic lawyer in the highly successful crime drama &quot;Damini&quot; and was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor and the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. The pathbreaking film was praised for breaking social taboos and handling the subject of rape with sensitivity; a rarity in Bollywood at the time. It further strengthened Deol&#x27;s He-Man image. His dialogues in the film &quot;Tarikh Pe Tarikh&quot; (date after date) and &quot;Dhai Kilo Ka Haath&quot; (Two-and-a-half kilogram hand) became iconic and a pop-culture reference. The film was a milestone in the careers of Deol as well as Amrish Puri who went onto star in various films together in the future. Besides being critically acclaimed, the film also became the sixth highest-grossing film of the year and was declared a &quot;hit&quot; by Box Office India. That same year, Deol portrayed the character of a lieutenant army officer in Yash Chopra&#x27;s musical psychological thriller &quot;Darr&quot;. The film earned Deol his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. It was declared a blockbuster and was the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India, and the highest-grossing Indian film of the year in the overseas markets. It received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It was also noted for being Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s breakthrough film.

In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Insaniyat&quot;, he appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan. The production had finished in 1988 but it was delayed for several years and finally released on 11 March 1994. By the time it released, Bachchan had gone into semi-retirement post the release of &quot;Khuda Gawah&quot; (1992) and it was citied as Bachchan&#x27;s last film. Due to Deol and Bachchan&#x27;s pairing, the film got an excellent opening but was panned critically due to poor editing and unfinished storyline. It still turned out to be the 10th highest-grossing film of the year.

At the time, 1996 marked Deol&#x27;s most successful year in terms of commercial success. The audiences saw four releases that year including &quot;Himmat&quot;, &quot;Jeet&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Ajay&quot;. Starring Alongside Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor, &quot;Jeet&quot; earned a worldwide collection of 30.5 crore. It became the 3rd highest grossing Bollywood film of 1996. In &quot;Jeet&quot;, Deol played a hitman who falls in love with a woman, prompting a dramatic struggle between his criminal past and a yearning for a better future. His performance was appreciated, with praise drawn towards his ability to blend action with romance. Deol also starred alongside Karisma Kapoor in &quot;Ajay&quot;, which was also successful and found its place in the list of highest grossers of the year. &quot;&quot;, released the same year, received critical and commercial acclaim, and was declared a blockbuster by &quot;Box Office India&quot;. It marked Santoshi&#x27;s third collaboration with Deol, Seshadri, and Puri after &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990) and &quot;Damini&quot; (1993). In this film, Deol played one of his most iconic characters Kashi Nath, who fights against a ruthless gangster to free his neighbourhood from tyranny and restore peace. The film earned Deol his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. Deol&#x27;s dialogues in &quot;Ghatak&quot; such as &quot;Ye Mazdoor Ka Haath Hai Katya&quot; (This is a labourer&#x27;s hand, Katya), &quot;Utha Utha Ke Patkunga&quot; (I will lift you and slam you repeatedly), and &quot;Cheer Dunga Faad Dunga Saale&quot; (I will tear you apart, you bastard) became popular among the audiences and influenced the pop culture of the time period.

Deol kicked off 1997 with &quot;Ziddi&quot; which had a lifetime collection of Rs. 324.3 million and was one of the highest grossing hits of 1997. He played a larger than life role of Deva, a hot headed man who takes revenge on the corrupt politicians responsible for his family&#x27;s suffering. The film flourished particularly in the domestic market. He followed it up with &quot;Border&quot;, an epic war film based on the real life events that happened during the Battle of Longewala in 1971, in which Deol played the leading role of decorated Indian Army officer Brigadier Kuldip Singh Chandpuri. The film featured an ensemble cast of Deol, Jackie Shroff, Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Khanna, Tabu, Raakhee, Pooja Bhatt, including others. It opened to strong box office results and was declared an all-time blockbuster by &quot;Box Office India&quot;. It also became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 1997 domestically, and the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year worldwide. &quot;Border&quot; grossed a worldwide total of and it was the fourth biggest blockbuster film of the 90s decade. It is often listed among the best Indian war films ever. The film was awarded several accolades, and earned Deol his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.
In 1998, Deol collaborated with Guddu Dhanoa once again after &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1997), to star in the action film &quot;Salaakhen&quot;. Featuring an identical cast to &quot;Ziddi&quot;, Raveena Tandon, Anupam Kher and Farida Jalal played supporting roles. The film was noted for its action sequences, cast performances and a notable monologue delivered by Deol during a courtroom hearing. Released on 24 April 1998, it recorded an excellent opening and was another hit for the actor.

His 1999 film &quot;Arjun Pandit&quot; marked his first collaboration with director Rahul Rawail after &quot;Yodha&quot;. Due to the critical and commercial success of their previous collaborations &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985) and &quot;Yodha&quot; (1991)&quot;,&quot; the film was one of the most awaited films of the year. Although it was not well reviewed upon release, the film became a hit. UP gangster Vikas Dubey was reported to be an ardent fan of this movie and rumoured to have watched it over 100 times. Inspired by his love for this movie, he had earned the monicker &quot;Pandit&quot;. In 1999 he made his directorial debut with &quot;Dillagi&quot; starring himself, his brother and Urmila Matondkar, but the film failed to gain success.

His first blockbuster hit in the millennium was 2001 film , directed by Anil Sharma, in which Deol played the role of a patriotic Indian truck driver, Tara Singh who falls in love with a Muslim girl, Sakeena, in the backdrop of 1947 partition violence, and makes a dramatic trip to Pakistan to get back his beloved. &quot;Gadar&quot; became the highest-grossing Hindi film up until then in mainstream cinema earning over worldwide. It ranks among the top 3 Indian films in all-time highest footfalls since 1990s. &quot;Gadar&quot; is also the third highest-grossing film in India since the 1990s when adjusted for inflation. The famous &quot;Handpump scene&quot; became a major cultural symbol and influenced the contemporary parody culture in India in the following years. Deol received high praise for his performance, as Taran Adarsh of &quot;IndiaFM&quot; wrote: &quot;To state that Gadar belongs to Deol would be an understatement. It&#x27;s difficult to imagine any other actor essaying this role with precision. The actor takes to the character like a fish takes to water and emerges triumphant.&quot; Deol was paid for his role in &quot;Gadar&quot;, the highest for any Indian actor at that time. The film earned him his sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In the same year, Deol also worked in another successful action thriller film &quot;Indian&quot; (2001). It received a record breaking opening, grossing a domestic nett of 18.0 million on its opening day. It was the fourth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year in India with collection of ₹42.60 crore. Critics felt that Deol&#x27;s role of DCP Rajshekhar Azad was &quot;tailor-made&quot; for him.

In 2002, Deol starred in the war film &quot;Maa Tujhhe Salaam&quot; which opened strongly and despite being among the highest-grossing films of the year, only emerged as a box office disappointment due to poor reviews. He played the role of Indian revolutionary Chandra Shekhar Azad in &quot;23rd March 1931: Shaheed&quot;, starring his brother Bobby Deol in the role of Bhagat Singh. The film&#x27;s release coincided with another film based on Bhagat Singh, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and titled &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot;. Both films failed at the box office.

Then, in 2003, Deol teamed up with director Anil Sharma yet again for &quot;The Hero: Love Story of a Spy&quot;, which also starred Preity Zinta and the debutant Priyanka Chopra. Released on 11 April, &quot;The Hero&quot; was billed as Bollywood&#x27;s most expensive film at that time with an estimated budget of . The film became the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of that year. Derek Elley from &quot;Variety&quot; wrote about the film and called it &quot;a wildly over-the-top, stridently nationalistic but undeniably entertaining slice of hokum.&quot;

=== 2004–2022: Downturn ===

During this phase of his career, Deol avoided traditional action films due to back injuries and experimented with various genres, achieving lackluster success.

In 2004, Deol starred in &quot;Lakeer&quot;, which featured an ensemble cast including Sunil Shetty, and newcomers Sohail Khan and John Abraham. The film was a flop. In the same year, he starred in the low budget sports comedy film &quot;Rok Sako To Rok Lo&quot;.

&quot;Jo Bole So Nihaal&quot; released in 2005 was Deol&#x27;s solo release for the year. Despite the buzz, the comedy film didn&#x27;t fare well at the box office. However, Deol&#x27;s unique portrayal sparked a noteworthy trend in the industry, inspiring the creation of comedic movies centered around Sikh protagonists exuding a carefree and jovial persona. This trend saw subsequent releases like &quot;Singh is Kinng&quot; (2008), &quot;Son of Sardaar&quot; (2012), and &quot;Singh is Bliing&quot; (2015) in the years that followed.

In early 2006, Deol starred in the techno-thriller &quot;Teesri Aankh&quot;. It marked the second time he co-starred alongside Ameesha Patel, after the all-time blockbuster &quot;Gadar&quot;. The film was inspired by the 1994 movie &quot;Mute Witness&quot;. It was panned by critics and turned out to be a disaster. In September 2006, Deol took on a role in the action-adventure film &quot;Naksha&quot;, an endeavour by Bollywood to capture the essence of films seen in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot; series. Despite being hailed as ahead of its time by certain critics, the movie unfortunately met with box office failure.

Deol kicked off 2007 with another atypical film for the time, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, a vigilante film. This was supposed to be Priyanka Chopra&#x27;s first release in 2002 but was delayed by almost 5 years. Continuing his year, he appeared in the comedic caper &quot;Fool N Final&quot;, sharing the spotlight with emerging talents Shahid Kapoor and Ayesha Takia. This film was also a box office disappointment. Deol appeared alongside his father Dharmendra and brother Bobby Deol together for the first time in &quot;Apne&quot; (2007), a family sports-drama film. The film garnered significant hype and achieved considerable success.

In 2008, he appeared with his brother again in the ensemble film &quot;Heroes&quot;. Deol&#x27;s performance, although brief, was praised. 2009 saw Deol star in the thriller &quot;Fox&quot; (2009) opposite Arjun Rampal. It marked Deol&#x27;s first film appearing as an antagonist. The film was inspired from Hollywood film &quot;A Murder of Crows&quot; (1999). It was another commercial failure for the actor.

Deol&#x27;s first release of 2010 was Neeraj Pathak&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Right Yaaa Wrong&quot; which had him playing a police inspector. &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; which also featured him alongside his father and brother was Deol&#x27;s only release in 2011. The surreal comedy was declared a hit.

For the first time in his career, Deol lent his voice in the Animated film &quot;Mahabharata&quot; for the role of Bheem. It earned ₹16.9 million. &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana 2&quot;, a sequel to his 2011 hit was released in 2013 but the film was a critical and box office failure. In the end of 2013 Deol teamed up with Anil Sharma yet again for &quot;Singh Saab The Great&quot; which was received positively. It was Deol&#x27;s comeback to traditional action genre and the film turned out be a moderate success.
In 2015, he worked in &quot;Radhika Rao&quot; and &quot;Vinay Sapru&quot; &quot;I Love NY&quot; opposite Kangana Ranaut. Due to an unknown reason, the film was delayed from its original release date of 2011 and released several years later. It did not fare well at the box office.

In 2016, &quot;Ghayal Once Again was released&quot; which was a sequel to his 1990 film &quot;Ghayal&quot;. It marked Deol&#x27;s second film directorial since &quot;Dillagi&quot; (1999). It was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. The action sequences were praised but the story and pacing were criticised. The film earned well upon release, but was ultimately declared a failure by the end of its theatrical run.

In 2017, he and his brother appeared in Shreyas Talpade&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Poster Boys&quot;, which flopped at the box office. This was Bobby Deol&#x27;s comeback film after a hiatus of three years but could not re-establish him.

In 2018, Deol appeared in &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana: Phir Se&quot;, the third film in the franchise. Also that year, two of his long delayed films &quot;Bhaiyyaji Superhitt&quot; (where he plays a double role for the first time), and &quot;Mohalla Assi&quot; were released. All of them were box office failures.

Meanwhile, in 2019, Deol took the mantle of a director again, his third film as a director, &quot;Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas&quot;, which marked the debut of his son Karan Deol, with another newcomer Sahher Bambba in lead roles. He declined the lead role in the 2019 hit film &quot;Kesari&quot;.

In 2022, Deol starred in the crime thriller &quot;&quot; directed by R. Balki. Alongside Dulquer Salmaan, Shreya Dhanwanthary and Pooja Bhatt. The plot of the film centered around a serial killer who targets dishonest film critics. Released on 23 September 2022, where it received positive reviews from critics. Deol won the &quot;Lions Gold Awards&quot; for Male Action Star Of The Year 2022.

=== 2023–present: Resurgence ===

The sequel of the 2001 film &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gadar 2&quot;, was released on 11 August 2023. The film&#x27;s story was centered around the era of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, in which Deol as Tara Singh returns to Pakistan to bring back his son. It was directed and produced by Anil Sharma, and the film starred Deol along with Ameesha Patel, and Utkarsh Sharma in lead roles. &quot;Gadar 2&quot; emerged as the highest-grossing film in Deol&#x27;s career. The film earned ₹691 crore worldwide, and became the year&#x27;s 4th highest-grosser, as well as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. Deol&#x27;s performance in &quot;Gadar 2&quot; earned him several award nominations, including his seventh nomination for a Filmfare Award in the Best Actor category. Deol won the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Viewer&#x27;s Choice) for &quot;Gadar 2&quot;, while he was also named the GQ India Leading Man of the Year 2023.

Deol has various upcoming projects lined up. He is reuniting with Rajkumar Santoshi to headline &quot;Lahore 1947&quot; (2025) which will be produced by Aamir Khan. Based on the play &quot;Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya O Jamyai Nai&quot; by Asghar Wajahat, it will be set against the backdrop of 1947 partition of India. The film will also feature Preity Zinta.

He is set to play the lead role in the sequel to 1997&#x27;s &quot;Border&quot;, titled &quot;Border 2&quot; (2026). He will play the role of Lord Hanuman in Nitesh Tiwari directorial &quot;Ramayana: Part 1&quot; (2026), based on the Indian epic.

== Political career ==
Deol joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 23 April 2019. Ahead of the elections, he made several promises, including pledging to open the border for trade with Pakistan and Central Asian nations. While his intentions were praised, his approach was criticised to be impractical and politically naive. He won the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections from Gurdaspur constituency in Punjab against Sunil Jakhar of Indian national Congress with a margin of 82,459 votes .

Deol&#x27;s political career was deemed unsuccessful. &quot;Tribune India&quot; remarked, &quot;History will not be kind to... Sunny Deol, when it judges him as an MP in the times to come.&quot; By 11 December 2023, he had an attendance of 18% in the Parliament. The national average for the same is 79%. Deol missed six parliamentary sessions and posed only four questions, with just one concerning Gurdaspur. He inquired about illegal sand mining in his constituency but did not engage in any debates. Deol stopped visiting Gurdaspur after September 2020 and failed to return even during the floods in August 2023. Deol utilised only ₹7 crore from his MP Local Area Development Fund over five years, despite being entitled to ₹5 crore annually. In the last two years of his term, he made no requests for funds and spent nothing in his constituency from the available resources. When questioned for his minimal participation in the lower house, he addressed, “When I go [to Lok Sabha], I see people who run the country are sitting there, from every party. But how do they behave? And then we tell others not to behave that way.&quot;

In an &quot;Aap Ki Adaalat&quot; interview, Deol addressed concerns about his low attendance in Parliament, stating that his focus was on serving his constituency and that his presence in Parliament did not impact his work. He also cited COVID-19 as a factor contributing to his absence. Deol emphasised that, while he has a record of his accomplishments, he is not one to publicly promote them. He became secluded towards the end and did not invite a single person from his constituency to his son&#x27;s wedding in June 2023.

Deol announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2024, stating that he is not suited for politics and wishes to focus on creating quality cinema.

Like the rest of the Deol family, Sunny belongs to the Arya Samaj, a modern Hindu reformist movement which relies only on the Vedas, professes monotheism and fights against what it considers to be superstitions, including idolatry.

== In the media ==
Deol is frequently recognised as a superstar of Indian cinema. He established himself as an action hero, with his roles in &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985), &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Border&quot; (1997), and &quot;&quot; (2001). Deol&#x27;s portrayals personified masculinity and anti-authoritarianism in India. At the peak of his career, Deol was known for his muscular physique. He has been noted as one of the pioneers who kickstarted the trend of bodybuilding in Bollywood. Deol was one of the prominent actors of Hindi cinema in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s, appearing in Box Office India&#x27;s list of top actors nine times from 1989 to 2002. Deol topped the list twice, in 1997 and 2001. Deol was one of the highest paid actors of Hindi cinema during the 1990s. Since 1990, Deol has the third most bumper openings at the box office with a total of 10, behind only Shah Rukh Khan (18) and Salman Khan (14). He has also given three record openers since 1990 including &quot;Kshatriya&quot; (1993), &quot;Border&quot; (1997), and &quot;Indian&quot; (2001). Deol is the first and only Indian actor to deliver an all-time blockbuster as a lead hero after turning 60, he was 66 when he accomplished this landmark with his 2023 release &quot;Gadar 2&quot;. He has been compared to Sylvester Stallone, earning him the moniker of &quot;Indian Rambo&quot;.

In 2016, Geeta Phogat, the Indian wrestler and Olympic gold medalist, expressed her admiration for Deol, citing him as her favourite actor and how she drew inspiration from his &quot;angry man&quot; portrayals. Also in 2016, actors Varun Dhawan and John Abraham referred to Deol as &quot;the greatest action hero of Bollywood&quot;. Deol&#x27;s dialogues, including &quot;Balwant Rai Ke Kutto&quot;, &quot;Dhai Kilo ka Haath&quot;, and &quot;Tarikh Pe Tarikh&quot;, are considered iconic. In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated India&#x27;s spirit by tweeting one of Deol&#x27;s dialogues: &quot;&quot;. In 2022, he was placed in Outlook India&#x27;s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actors&quot; list. News18 named him &quot;The Blockbuster King Of The &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2023, Deol was referenced in the lyrics of Haryanvi singer Raju Punjabi&#x27;s viral song &quot;Choudhar Jaat Ki&quot;. The specific lines from the song were, &quot;Hawa banai thadi re meri Sunny Deol si body re (I make you look good with my Sunny Deol-like body)&quot;. Deol is renowned for his powerful voice, serving as an inspiration for many imitators and voice actors. Kiku Sharda repeatedly mimics Deol on &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot;. In the Hindi-dubbed version of the cartoon series &quot;Oggy and the Cockroaches&quot;, the character Jack is voiced by Saurav Chakrabarti, who emulates Deol&#x27;s distinctive vocal style.

== Artistry ==

Many of Deol&#x27;s films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. Primarily, his films often center around protagonists hailing from modest backgrounds, who find themselves entangled in conflicts with crime syndicates and systemic corruption. Despite seeking help from legal channels, the characters invariably encounter hurdles within the justice system, compelling them to take matters into their own hands and resort to vigilantism as a means of seeking retribution against the antagonists. This narrative framework serves as a vehicle for exploring broader societal issues, including the shortcomings of law enforcement, discrimination, exploitation of the marginalised, and pervasive corruption, which are portrayed through the protagonists&#x27; struggles and impassioned dialogues delivered by Deol.

In contrast to the stereotype of the silent action hero, Deol&#x27;s characters are men of action and articulate numerous words. Initially conflict-avoidant, they pivot to unfiltered anger when met with opposition, progressing to threats of violence charged with indignation, and ultimately resorting to physical force. Notably, Deol&#x27;s characters seldom instigate violence independently and only respond when provoked.

Deol&#x27;s filmography is also marked by instances of graphic violence, such as the arm-tearing scene in &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1997). Moreover, he frequently assumes roles of leadership, either of military units, as in &quot;Border&quot; (1997) and &quot;Maa Tujhhe Salaam&quot; (2002), or radical vigilante groups evident in films like &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985), &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1997) and &quot;Big Brother&quot; (2007).

In his portrayal of everyday interactions, Deol&#x27;s characters embody the ideal citizen advocating for truth, honesty, integrity, and patriotism, while exhibiting profound respect for familial and individual values. Physically, Deol embodies a rugged and muscular physique, distinguished by its lack of hyper-vascular aesthetics and the presence of natural body hair. Even in romantic relationships, Deol is depicted as a caring and respectful partner characterised by consideration for his partner&#x27;s feelings and autonomy. They avoid overly dramatic displays of love and do not chase their love interest upon rejection, a departure from conventional Bollywood portrayals of romance.

Deol has consistently faced criticism for his dancing skills throughout his career. In defence, the actor argues that his characters portray relatable individuals who are not expected to be expert dancers. However, this explanation has not shielded him from public scrutiny, as his choreography has often been the subject of parody and memes. Early in his career, Deol largely refrained from dancing, but as his career progressed, his dance routines became a distinctive part of his screen persona. Songs like &quot;Yaara O Yaara&quot; gained popularity not only for their music but also for Deol&#x27;s unconventional dance moves. Deol has acknowledged the criticism openly and maintains a lighthearted attitude towards it.

The 1990s in India were marked by significant socio-economic changes, the emergence of social justice politics, and the implementation of various reforms. Deol&#x27;s characters embodied the frustrations and aspirations of the common man during this transformative period. His films became cultural touchstones of the time, resonating with the audience and making him an aspirational role model and heroic figure of the era.

==Public Image==
Deol is commonly addressed as &quot;Sunny Paaji&quot;, signifying the term &#x27;elder brother&#x27;. Deol is known for being a humble, shy, and gentle person, who values his privacy and does not socialize much. He is also seen as a passionate, loyal, and dedicated actor, who works hard and does not compromise on his beliefs. His father characterised him as &quot;painfully introverted&quot; and lamented that he remains very distant despite his capacity for love. Deol is often absent from industry parties and events. In an interview with NDTV, he explained that, early in his career, he was labelled as &quot;snooty and snobbish&quot;. However, as people got to know him, they realised that his aloofness was simply due to shyness. Over time, invitations dwindled because people understood that he was unlikely to attend. He is also particularly known for his extreme shyness around his female co-stars.

Deol is regarded for his punctuality and discipline on set. He has worked with several debutant directors throughout his career, including Rahul Rawail in &quot;Betaab&quot; (1983), Rajkumar Santoshi in &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), and N. Maharajan in &quot;Indian&quot; (2001). In 2005, he played a pivotal role in launching Imtiaz Ali&#x27;s directorial career with &quot;Socha Na Tha&quot;. Following a meeting with Deol, who agreed to review Ali&#x27;s script and produce the film, the project was greenlit. Reflecting on this significant moment, Ali stated, &quot;He didn&#x27;t ask me where I was from or about my experience. He holds a significant place in my life because he gave me my first film.&quot;

Indian actor Gaurav Chopra praised Deol, &quot;He is everything that you&#x27;ve known him to be over so many years. He is not very talkative on the set, but it takes you 5 minutes to understand that he likes to keep it simple. He likes to keep his life and his presence grounded. Not just him, his entire staff, his entire aura, his entire presence on the set is grounded.&quot; Actress Priyanka Chopra made her Bollywood debut alongside Deol and recalled being incredibly nervous and &quot;shaking&quot; when she first met him. Despite rumours about her acting skills and talks of replacing her, Deol saw her potential and insisted on giving her a chance.

In recent years, he has been vocal about the bias and negativity he faced from the industry after the success of his film &quot;Gadar&quot;. He said that he was not offered any good scripts and that many of his contemporaries were jealous of his success.

===Controversies===
Deol starred in the Yash Chopra-directed &quot;Darr&quot; (1993), where he played the protagonist opposite Shah Rukh Khan. &quot;Darr&quot; was one of the most anticipated films of 1993 due to it being the first collaboration between Deol and Chopra, and recorded a bumper opening at the box office largely credited to Deol&#x27;s role. Despite the film&#x27;s commercial success, Deol felt betrayed and cheated by the director, who he accused of glorifying the villain and sidelining the hero. He claimed that the final version differed significantly from what was initially conveyed to him, with edited scenes that he was not informed about. He had a heated argument with Chopra over the climax of the film, during which he ripped his pants in anger. Although over the years, this act has been praised as a feat of strength, since Deol had his hands stuffed in his pockets and ripped his jeans all the way down in a fit of anger. After the release of the film, he vowed to never work with Chopra again. Subsequently, he did not speak to Khan for 16 years, but he admitted that it was not deliberate. Since then, Deol and Khan have reconciled.

Deol faced a boycott by the farmers of Punjab, who were protesting against the farm laws passed by the central government in 2020. Deol, as a BJP MP from Gurdaspur constituency of Punjab, was seen as a supporter of the government and a betrayer of the farmers. He was also accused of being silent and inactive on the issue, and of not raising the voice of his constituents in the parliament. He later backed the new farm laws which led to the farmers also burning his effigies and posters, and refusing to watch his films.

<doc id="974016" wikidata="Q5131886" url="?curid=974016" title="Clerk of works">
<text>A clerk of works or clerk of the works (CoW) is employed by an architect or a client on a construction site. The role is primarily to represent the interests of the client in regard to ensuring that the quality of both materials and workmanship are in accordance with the design information such as specification and engineering drawings, in addition to recognized quality standards. The role is defined in standard forms of contract such as those published by the Joint Contracts Tribunal. Clerks of works are also the most highly qualified non-commissioned tradesmen in the Royal Engineers. The qualification can be held in three specialisms: electrical, mechanical and construction.

Historically, the clerk of works was employed by the architect on behalf of a client, or by local authorities to oversee public works. The clerks of works can also be employed by the client (state body/local authority/private client) to monitor design and build projects where the traditional role of the architect is within the design and build project team.

&quot;Maître d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; (master of work) is a term used in many Francophone jurisdictions for the office that carries out this job in major projects; the Channel Tunnel project had such an office. In Italy, the term used is &quot;direttore dei lavori&quot; (manager of the works).

==Origins of the title==
The job title is believed to derive from the 13th century when monks and priests (i.e. &quot;clerics&quot; or &quot;clerks&quot;) were accepted as being more literate than the builders of the age and took on the responsibility of supervising the works associated with the erection of churches and other religious property. As craftsmen and masons became more educated they in turn took on the role, but the title did not change. By the 19th century the role had expanded to cover the majority of building works, and the clerk of works was drawn from experienced tradesmen who had wide knowledge and understanding of the building process.

==The role==
The role, to this day, is based on the impartiality of the clerk of works in ensuring that value for money for the client - rather than the contractor - is achieved through rigorous and detailed inspection of materials and workmanship throughout the building process. In many cases, the traditional title has been discarded to comply with modern trends, such as site inspector, architectural inspector and quality inspector, but the requirement for the role remains unchanged since the origins of the title.

The clerk of works is a very isolated profession on site. He/she is the person that must ensure quality of both materials and workmanship and, to this end, must be absolutely impartial and independent in decisions and judgments. He/she cannot normally, by virtue of the quality role, be employed by the contractor - only the client, normally by the architect on behalf of the client. His/her role is not to judge, but simply to report all occurrences that are relevant to the role.

Clerks of works are either on site all the time or make regular visits. They must be vigilant in their inspections of a large range of technical aspects of the work. This involves:
* making sure that work is carried out to the client&#x27;s standards, specification, correct materials, workmanship and schedule
* becoming familiar with all the relevant drawings and written instructions, checking them and using them as a reference when inspecting work
* making visual inspections
* taking measurements and samples on site to make sure that the work and the materials meet the specifications and quality standards
* being familiar with legal requirements and checking that the work complies with them.
* having a working knowledge of health and safety legislation and bringing any shortfalls observed to the attention of the resident engineer.
* advising the contractor about certain aspects of the work, particularly when something has gone wrong, but this advice should not be interpreted as an instruction

==Notable clerks of works==
* Geoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400) was an English author, poet, philosopher, bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat and Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works.
* John Louth was appointed first clerk of works of the Board of Ordnance by Henry V in 1414 along with Nicholas Merbury, Master of Ordnance. The Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and Royal Army Ordnance Corps can all trace their origins to this date.
* William of Wykeham, Lord Chancellor and Bishop of Winchester (1323–1404) was Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works.
* William Dickinson, Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works from 1660 to his death in 1702 and Controller Clerk at Windsor Castle. His son, William Dickinson, was architect and Deputy Surveyor of Westminster Abbey under Sir Christopher Wren.
* James Nedeham or Needham, was appointed Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works on 30 April 1530, and during that and the two following years devised and superintended the building alterations at Esher, York Place, and Westminster Palace. In September 1532, he was engaged in the &quot;re-edifying&quot; of St. Thomas&#x27;s Tower within the Tower of London, and was occupied on that and other works in the Tower during the next three years. In April 1533, he was appointed by grant Clerk and Overseer of the King&#x27;s Works in England.

==The Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate of Great Britain Incorporated==

The ICWCI - motto: &quot;Potestate, Probitate et Vigilantia&quot; (Ability, Integrity and Vigilance) - is the professional body that supports quality construction through systematic inspection. As a membership organisation, it provides a support network of meeting centres, technical advice, publications and events to help keep members up to date with the ever-changing construction industry.

Post-nominals for members are FICWCI (Fellow), MICWCI (Member) and LICWCI (Licentiate).

===History===
The institute was founded in 1882 as the Clerk of Works Association, becoming the Incorporated Clerk of Works Association of Great Britain in 1903. In 1947, its name was amended again to the Institute of Clerks of Works of Great Britain Incorporated, a title it retained until 2009 when it was expanded to the Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate of Great Britain Incorporated.

The organisation was founded to allow those who were required to operate in isolation on site, a central organisation to look after the interests of their chosen profession, be it through association with other professional bodies, educational means or simply through social intercourse among their own peers and contemporaries. Essential to this, as the Institute developed, was the development of a central body that could lobby Parliament in relation to their profession, and the quality issues that it stands for.
Though the means of construction, training of individuals, and the way individuals are employed have changed dramatically over the years, the principles the Institute originally formed for remain sacrosanct. Experience in the many facets of the building trade is essential and, in general terms, most practitioners have &quot;come from the tools&quot;, though further third-level education in the built environment is essential.

===&#x27;Building on Quality&#x27; Awards===
The Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate hold the biannual Building on Quality Awards, and nominations are accepted from all involved in quality site inspection regardless of whether they are members of the institute. Judging is based on the Clerk of Works&#x27; ability, his/her contribution to the projects he/she is involved with, his/her record keeping and reports, and his/her commitment to the role of Clerk of Works.

Awards given in each category are Overall Winner, Highly Commended and Commended. The Overall Winner is chosen from all categories and is widely considered the highest accolade that can be awarded to a clerk of works in recognition of his work. Newly introduced in 2013 was the Peter Wilson Memorial trophy, which has now had two deserving recipients. The trophy was donated by the Cumbria and North Lancashire Chapter to the ICWCI in memoriam of Vice President Peter Wilson FICWCI.

===Clerks of works in Canada===
The earliest record of a clerk of works in Canada was John Mactaggart who was the clerk of works for the Rideau Canal project in 1826. John Mactaggart was a British civil engineer and the chief clerk of works in charge of the project, reporting to Lieutenant-Colonel John By. John Morris was a notable clerk of works in the mid-1800s, completing several notable projects such as University College, University of Toronto, (1856–59), Parliament Building, the Departmental Buildings, and Government House.

During the renovations to Pembroke City Hall, W. J. Moore was clerk of the works for the addition in 1912 and J. L. Morris for the alterations in 1914.

<text>The Menard Press is a small-press independent publisher founded by Anthony Rudolf. It started as a magazine in 1969 and published its first book in 1971. Today, Menard Press is an imprint run by publisher Elte Rauch. 

The Menard Press has specialised in literary translation, mainly poetry. In addition to literary texts – original and translated poetry, original and translated fiction, non-fiction, art and literary criticism – the press has published essays on the nuclear issue (by Sir Martin Ryle and Lord Zuckerman, among others) as well as works and testimonies by survivors of Nazism, including the first English edition of Primo Levi&#x27;s poems.

In 2007, the press announced they would be publishing their last book, but would continue to be engaged in the literary and cultural field.

In 2021, Menard Press resumed its publishing work under the direction of Elte Rauch, who lives and works between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In Amsterdam, she runs the independent publishing house HetMoet.

She continues Rudolf&#x27;s legacy and adds feminism, science, internationalism and social justice to the press’ portfolio. Elte aims to sustainably reissue out-of-print titles as well as to offer new and contemporary Menard Press publications to a growing and variable audience, in both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

The first publication of the revived Menard Press imprint is &quot;On Being Ill&quot;, an anthology created during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the collaboration of authors and editors around the world in times of lockdown. Among the authors are classics such as Virginia Woolf and Audre Lorde, as well as contemporary writers Nadia de Vries, Deryn-Rees Jones, Lieke Marsman, Jameisha Prescod, Sinéad Gleeson, Nafissa Thompson-Spires and Mieke van Zonneveld.

<text>The European mole (Talpa europaea) is a mammal of the order Eulipotyphla. It is also known as the common mole and the northern mole.

This mole lives in a tunnel system, which it constantly extends. It uses these tunnels to hunt its prey. Under normal conditions, the displaced earth is pushed to the surface, resulting in the characteristic molehills. It is an omnivore that feeds mainly on earthworms, but also on insects, centipedes and mammals such as rodents and other moles. Its saliva contains toxins which paralyze earthworms in particular.

== Taxonomy ==
The Aquitanian mole (&quot;T. aquitania&quot;) was formerly considered conspecific, but was described as a distinct species in 2017.

== Distribution ==
The European mole has a wide range throughout Europe and westernmost Asia, being found as far north as the United Kingdom and southern Scandinavia, as far south as northern Greece, and as far east as western Siberia. It is the only mole species in most of this range. The Loire River in France was thought to form the western barrier to the species&#x27; range, separating it from the Aquitanian mole, but studies indicate that while this is largely true, it is not a strict barrier, as member of either species have been found on opposite sides of the river, likely making them sympatric in at least some places.

==Description==

The European mole has a cylindrical body and is long, weighing . Females are typically smaller than males. The eyes are small and hidden behind fur, while the ears are just small ridges in the skin. The fur is usually dark grey, but the actual range of colors is larger, as due to the subterranean habits there is no disadvantage in having off-colored fur. European moles with white, light grey, tan, taupe, and black fur have all been reported.

==Habitat==
While moles are typically found in tunnel systems, the European mole is not exclusively an underground dweller. In the spring and early summer when the young moles leave their mothers&#x27; burrows they must find new territories. This forces them to leave their burrows and they can either make new tunnel systems or enter existing systems. In the summer time, however, they are likely to burrow much more superficially. The superficial burrowing could be due in part to the soil that is much harder, which makes burrowing a greater challenge.

&quot;T. europaea&quot; have also been found to spend a lot of time at the sides of drainage lines and streams but do not inhabit flooded or dry soils. However, dry areas do become important when their normal habitats become flooded. Factors such as the type of soil, vegetation present, and altitude have no effect on the areas that moles choose to inhabit. The one factor that does greatly influence the mole population in a specific area is the abundance of earthworms. In suitable urban greenspace, an area of 10 hectares is required for population persistence, and the number of mole territories increases with available habitat.

==Reproduction==
The European mole has a relatively short breeding season, in the spring. Mating occurs over a span of a few weeks in March and April, followed by a gestation period of four to five weeks. Most births occur at the end of April or at the beginning of May. The litter size ranges from two to seven. The lactation period lasts for four to five weeks but at the end of June, the young are usually required to leave the tunnels. The lifespan is from three to five years.

==Feeding habits==
One common belief about European moles is that they typically consume their own weight in food every 24 hours, but this is an exaggeration. Studies have been performed that show European moles eat about half of their body weight in food each day. When in captivity, European moles will eat a wide variety of food items, including liver, mice, mealworms, shrews and maggots. However, they tend to prefer earthworms over all other options. In areas without as many earthworms, insects are the main dietary constituent. Moles eat both larval and adult insects.

==Vision==
Due to the subterranean nature of this mole, there is an anatomical regression of its eyes at several organizational levels. Its eye has a diameter of only , it is buried beneath fur and has a cellular lens. The organization of the retina is quite similar to that of a typical mammal. It has been determined that there are about 2000 ganglion cells and the optic nerve is roughly 50 μm with 3000 axons. Roughly 15% of these axons are myelinated. The photoreceptors are not the normal rod-like or cone-like shape that one would expect to see. Instead they all have one uniform shape with three distinct features: 
#The receptors are short along the radial axis
#The inner and outer segments are similar in length
#The outer segments appear to be significantly degenerated

Studies have shown that &quot;T. europaea&quot; does have photopic vision, contrary to popular belief that all moles are blind. Two cone opsins have been found in the eyes of &quot;T. europaea&quot; but their function is still under investigation. In a study of the mole eyes it was found that &quot;Talpa&quot; withdraws when exposed to a flashlight and it can also perform light/dark discrimination tasks. The cone cells in the eye are unlikely to provide high-resolution vision but they could allow a detection of movement and some hue discrimination. It is suggested that in subterranean mammals vision is used to detect predators that have broken into the tunnels.

==Hearing==
In mammals, the cues for hearing are usually based on inter-aural intensity differences, which occur as a result of the diffraction of a progressive sound wave by the head and pinna. They could also be based on inter-aural time differences that are present because of the distance between their two ears. European moles have no pinnae, so they are thought to hear at low frequencies. In addition to this, their inner ear is unusual for that of a mammal, due to the large trabeculation of the posterior ventral skull between the ears. The tympana of the ear lies almost horizontally and the manubrial tips are separated by a distance of . The results of several studies confirm that there is good transmission through the European mole&#x27;s head for a range of low frequencies. Because of this it is expected that there will be acoustic interaction at each tympanic membrane. There are also suggestions that the ears of this mole act as balanced pressure-difference receivers. This system has never been suggested for a mammal in the past, but reptiles, amphibia, birds, and crickets have been shown to have a direct air pathway between the tympana.

==Skeletal development==
In &quot;Talpa europaea&quot;, there are several unique changes in ossification sequence in the postcranial elements. Many of the shifts are seen in the vertebral column, specifically the cervical and thoracic regions. The shifts allow the moles to have a more stabilized body axis and cervical region after they are born.

After a European mole is born and begins to develop, it will begin to crawl around and dig. As a result of the constant digging action, elements of the forelimb that are associated with those movements will begin to ossify. Some elements in the hands of &quot;Talpa europaea&quot;, formally described as distal phalanges, are actually the first to ossify. These elements build up a groove for the distal phalanges, but ultimately do not fuse with them. These bony elements develop directly, meaning they do not have any cartilaginous precursors. The extra-calcified elements are created from small, calcified particles that are found in the fibrous part of the flexor digitorum profundus. The particles then fuse later in life to form the solid element of the hand. Additionally, the sesamoid bone in the European mole &quot;sensu stricto&quot; is a bone that develops within a tendon. It does have a chondrified precursor and it assists the tendon in transmitting force.

==Dentition==
The variance of morphology between species is very important to paleontologists, as it can help define a fossil species. Unlike other characteristics that do not fossilize, like color and karyotype, dentition can be studied, as it fossilizes well and varies from species to species. Studying dentition can be very beneficial in recognizing the differences between fossils and subsequently being able to classify them.

The Roman mole (&quot;Talpa romana&quot;) was once considered a subspecies of the European mole, as they are of similar size. The only obvious difference between the two is that &quot;T. romana&quot; has skin-covered eyes and it also has a caecoid pelvis, whereas &quot;T. europaea&quot; has a europoid pelvis. Although similar in body, the dentition of &quot;T. romana&quot; is obviously larger in size than that &quot;T. europaea&quot;. Both the length of the tooth row and the individual elements are larger. Moreover, the mesotyle of the upper molars is generally divided. The dentition of &quot;T. europaea&quot; is small and the length of M1-M3 is less than 19% of the length of the condyle base. This mole also has relatively small molars for its size.

<doc id="974035" wikidata="Q2150189" url="?curid=974035" title="Richard Maurice Bucke">
<text>Richard Maurice Bucke (18 March 1837 – 19 February 1902), often called Maurice Bucke, was a Canadian psychiatrist in the late 19th century. An adventurer during his youth, Bucke later studied medicine. Eventually, as a psychiatrist, he headed the provincial Asylum for the Insane in London, Ontario. Bucke was a friend of several noted men of letters in Canada, the United States, and England. Besides publishing professional articles, Bucke wrote three non-fiction books: &quot;Man&#x27;s Moral Nature&quot;, &quot;Walt Whitman&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind&quot;, which is his best-known work.

==Early life==
Richard Maurice Bucke was born in 1837 in Methwold, England, the son of Rev. Horatio Walpole Bucke (a parish curate) and his wife Clarissa Andrews. The parents and their children emigrated to Canada when he was a year old, settling near London, Upper Canada.

Horatio W. Bucke had given up the profession of religious minister, and trusted his family&#x27;s income to their Ontario farm. A sibling in a large family, Richard Maurice Bucke was a typical farm boy of that era. He was an athletic boy who enjoyed a good ball game. When he left home at the age of 16, he traveled to Columbus, Ohio and then to California. Along the way, Bucke worked at various odd jobs. He was part of a travelling party who had to fight for their lives when they were attacked by a group of Shoshone people, on whose territory they were trespassing.

In the winter of 1857–58, he was nearly frozen to death in the mountains of California, where he was the sole survivor of a silver-mining party. He had to walk out over the mountains and suffered extreme frostbite. As a result, a foot and several of his toes were amputated. He then returned to Canada via the Isthmus of Panama, probably in 1858. Henry Mills Hurd says he returned to Canada in 1860.

==Medicine and psychiatry==

Bucke enrolled in McGill University&#x27;s medical school in Montreal, where he delivered a distinguished thesis in 1862. Although he practiced general medicine briefly as a ship&#x27;s surgeon (in order to pay for his sea travel), he later specialized in psychiatry. He did his internship in London (1862–63) at University College Hospital. During that time he visited France.

He was for several years an enthusiast of Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivist philosophy. Comte&#x27;s belief that religion, if by that is meant spirituality, had been outmoded by science contrasts with Bucke&#x27;s later belief concerning the nature of reality.

Bucke returned to Canada in 1864 and married Jessie Gurd in 1865; they had eight children. 
In January 1876, Bucke became the superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1877, he was appointed head of the provincial Asylum for the Insane in London, Ontario, a post he held for nearly the remainder of his life. In his work with asylum inmates, he was a reformer who encouraged organized sports and what is now called occupational therapy. Some of his surgical treatments proved deeply controversial. After adopting the Victorian-era theory that mental illness in women was often due to defective reproductive organs, Bucke began performing surgical removals of these organs from female patients. He continued this practice until his death, despite receiving increasing amounts of criticism from the medical health care community.

==Experience of &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;==

In 1872, after an evening of stimulating conversation with his friend Walt Whitman in the countryside, Richard M Bucke was traveling back to London in a buggy when he had a religious experience. He later described the characteristics and effects of the faculty of experiencing this type of consciousness as:

* its sudden appearance
* a subjective experience of light (&quot;inner light&quot;)
* moral elevation
* intellectual illumination
* a sense of immortality
* loss of a fear of death
* loss of a sense of sin

Bucke&#x27;s personal experience of the inner state had yet another attribute, mentioned separately by the author: the vivid sense of the universe as a living presence, rather than as basically lifeless, inert matter.

Bucke did not immediately record the details and interpretation of his experience. This was not done until years later, and only after he had researched much of the world&#x27;s literature on mysticism and enlightenment and had corresponded with many others about this subject.

==&quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;==

Bucke&#x27;s magnum opus was his book &quot;Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind&quot;. The book is a compilation of various theories rather than strictly a simple record of his original mystical experience.

Bucke borrowed the term &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; from Edward Carpenter, who had traveled and studied religion in the East. Bucke&#x27;s friend, Carpenter, had derived the term &quot;cosmic consciousness&quot; from the Eastern term &quot;universal consciousness.&quot; In his description of his personal experience, Bucke combined his recollection with thoughts of another of his friends, Caleb Pink (&quot;C.P.&quot;)—and others—and recorded his experience in a poetic style.

&quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot; was a book which he researched and wrote over a period of many years. It was published in 1901 and has been reprinted several times since then. In it, Bucke describes his own experience, the experiences of contemporaries (most notably Walt Whitman), and the experiences of historical figures, including Jesus, Saint Paul, Muhammad, Plotinus, Dante, Francis Bacon, William Blake, Buddha, and Ramakrishna.

Bucke developed a theory that posited three stages in the development of consciousness:

* the simple consciousness of animals
* the self-consciousness of the mass of humanity (encompassing reason, imagination, and foresight)
* cosmic consciousness — an emerging faculty which is the next stage of human development

Within self-consciousness, there exist gradations among individuals in their degrees of intellectual development and talent. (Bucke considered that no doubt there would be gradations within the level of cosmic consciousness, as well.)

Among the effects of humanity&#x27;s natural evolutionary progression, Bucke believed he detected a long historical trend in which religious conceptions and theologies had become less and less frightening.

In &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;, beginning with Part II, Bucke explains how animals developed the senses of hearing and seeing. Further development culminated in the ability to experience and enjoy music. Bucke states that, initially, only a small number of humans were able to see colors and experience music. But eventually these new abilities spread throughout the human race until only a very small number of people were unable to experience colors and music.

In Part III, Bucke hypothesizes that the next stage of human development, which he calls &quot;cosmic consciousness,&quot; is slowly beginning to appear and will eventually spread throughout all of humanity.

Bucke’s vision of the world was profoundly optimistic. He wrote in Part I (“First Words”) “that the universe is so built and ordered that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all, that the foundation principle of the world is what we call love and that the happiness of every one is in the long run absolutely certain.”

==Involvement with poetry and literature==
Bucke was deeply involved in the poetry scene in America and had friends among the literati, especially those who were poets. In 1869, he read &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; by Walt Whitman, an American poet, and was deeply impressed by it. In Cosmic Consciousness, he notes that his cosmic consciousness experience occurred following a night reading Whitman and Romantic poets. Later, he met Whitman in 1877 in Camden, New Jersey, and the two developed a lasting friendship.

Bucke later testified that he was &quot;lifted to and set upon a higher plane of existence&quot; because of his friendship with Whitman. He published a biography of Whitman in 1883 and was one of Whitman&#x27;s literary executors.

In 1882, Bucke was elected to the English Literature Section of the Royal Society of Canada.

==Death==
On 19 February 1902, Bucke slipped on a patch of ice in front of his home and struck his head. He died a few hours later without regaining consciousness.

==Legacy==
Bucke&#x27;s concept of cosmic consciousness took on a life of its own (though not always well understood) and influenced the thought and writings of many other people. His work is directly referenced by the mystics Franklin Merrell-Wolff and Ouspensky, and it was essential to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s concept of the perennial philosophy and Evelyn Underhill&#x27;s concept of mysticism. In India, Aurobindo uses the term cosmic consciousness extensively in his work and Ramana Maharshi was asked about Bucke&#x27;s concept. Erich Fromm says, in &quot;Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism&quot;, &quot;What Bucke describes as cosmic consciousness is, in my opinion, precisely the experience which is called &quot;satori&quot; in Zen Buddhism&quot; and that &quot;Bucke&#x27;s book is perhaps the book most germane to the topic of this article.&quot;

Along with William James&#x27;s classic work &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (which cites Bucke), Bucke&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot; has become part of the foundation of transpersonal psychology.

Bucke was part of a movement that sought to improve the care and treatment of mentally ill persons.

He was one of the founders of the Medical School of the University of Western Ontario. His papers are held at Western University&#x27;s Archives and Research Collections Centre.

He was portrayed by Colm Feore in the 1990 Canadian film &quot;Beautiful Dreamers&quot;.

<doc id="974041" wikidata="Q5468651" url="?curid=974041" title="Foreman of signals">
<text>A foreman of signals is a highly qualified senior NCO or warrant officer signals engineering manager in the Royal Corps of Signals of the British Army and other Commonwealth armies. They undertake the role of equipment care specialist, with additional responsibilities for engineering and technical project management sometimes.

==Selection and training process==
A soldier from the Royal Corps of Signals selected for foreman of signals training must hold a minimum qualification of class 1 communications systems engineer, have served a minimum of ten years within the Army and hold the rank of corporal or above. To be accepted onto the foreman of signals course, each individual candidate must follow a strict selection process that starts 15 months before the course start date. From May to December, the candidates must complete tutor marked assessments (TMAs) which are submitted monthly. In January, the candidates sit two three-hour exams, which are co-ordinated to start concurrently around the world. Successful candidates then attend a one-week selection board where different management and technical tasks are used to assess the candidates&#x27; suitability to the task of becoming a foreman of signals.

There are usually close to a hundred eligible candidates every year. However, the board only selects between 8 and 20 students for each course, which typically commences in the first week of September each year and lasts 20 months. During the course, they are given the rank of acting sergeant.

==Career progression==
On completion of the course, the soldier is promoted to staff sergeant if the rank is not already held, and assumes the appointment of foreman of signals. They work as part of a unit operations team with a yeoman of signals, who is a communications technical specialist. The holder of the appointment can be promoted through the ranks from staff sergeant, to warrant officer class 2, then warrant officer class 1. To distinguish the appointment, the suffix of FofS is used (i.e. SSgt(FofS), WO2(FofS), WO1(FofS)).

==History==
The title has definitely existed since the formation of the Royal Corps of Signals and may have been used previously in the Royal Engineers Signal Service. Formerly, staff sergeants and warrant officers class 2 held the appointment of foreman of signals quartermaster sergeant (FoSQMS) and warrant officers class 1 held the appointment of foreman of signals sergeant major (FoSSM).

The first foreman of signals course was held in 1951 and the current courses () are the 86th and 87th running of the course.

==India==
In the Indian Army Corps of Signals, a foreman of signals holds junior commissioned officer rank and must have had a minimum of ten years&#x27; service. Training courses are conducted at the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering at Mhow.

<doc id="974042" wikidata="Q270857" url="?curid=974042" title="Lee Jung-hyun">
<text>Lee Jung-hyun (; born February 7, 1980), also known by her occasional stage name Ava, is a South Korean singer and actress. She was first recognized for her acting abilities with award-winning role in her first film and has been solidified as one of the top international acts from South Korea with her illustrious singing career. She has been known as &quot;the Techno Queen&quot; as she introduced the techno music genre to Korea. Lee is also known as &quot;The Queen of Transformation&quot; due to her changing new look for different songs. She is known as one of the first artists who introduced Korean Wave (Hallyu) to China and caused a sensation.

==Career==
===As actress===
Lee Jung-hyun made her acting debut at the age of 16 in &quot;A Petal&quot; in 1996, which won her &#x27;Best New Actress&#x27; at the 34th Grand Bell Awards, 17th Blue Dragon Film Awards and 16th Korean Association of Film Critics Awards. The film tells the story of a girl who experienced the Gwangju uprising at the age of 15, and its effect on her life in later years. Since 1996, Lee has had numerous acting roles with projects in South Korea, Japan and China.

In 2010, Lee regained her acting strides with the Chinese series &quot;Confucius&quot;, playing the role of Nanzi. In 2011, Lee portrayed a shaman in Park Chan-wook and Park Chan-kyong&#x27;s award-winning fantasy short film &quot;Night Fishing&quot;, which was shot entirely on an iPhone. &quot;Night Fishing&quot; won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film at 2011 Berlin International Film Festival. In 2012, Lee portrayed a single mother in the coming-of-age film &quot;Juvenile Offender&quot;, which won Best Feature at the Tokyo International Film Festival. She was next cast in the 2014 period blockbuster &quot;The Admiral: Roaring Currents&quot;, as the sole female character in the main cast. Lee returned to television in the SBS&#x27; drama &quot;The Family is Coming&quot;.

In 2015, Lee starred in black comedy film &quot;Alice in Earnestland&quot;, which won her &#x27;Best Actress&#x27; at the 36th Blue Dragon Film Awards &amp; 3rd Wildflower Film Awards. Lee then starred in the bowling film &quot;Split&quot; in 2016, and war film &quot;The Battleship Island&quot; in 2017. In 2019, Lee is scheduled to star in the romantic comedy film &quot;Shall We Do It Again&quot;.

In 2020, Lee starred in the zombie film &quot;Peninsula&quot;. The following year, she appeared in Park Chan-wook&#x27;s mystery film &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;.

===As singer===
After debuting with an award-winning acting performance, Lee etched her singing career by introducing techno genre to the K-Pop scene and her ever-reinventing styles for each and every song. Lee assumes a unique persona for each release, such as a mermaid, Barbie doll, tribal queen, soldier, Korean folk dancer, belly dancer, or princess of the sea. She has garnered many nicknames over the years, including Techno Queen of Korea, Queen of Performance Art, Ms. Charisma, Little Giant, and Queen of Change.

Before releasing her first solo music she featured as a guest vocalist on the Jo PD single &quot;Fever&quot;, also appearing in the music video. She also appeared in the music video for Goofy&#x27;s &quot;The Rule of the Game&quot;.

Her early work is techno-style dance music. Her first single, &quot;Wa&quot; (와, &quot;Come&quot;) topped the Korean charts for three weeks, while her second, &quot;Bakkweo&quot; (바꿔, &quot;Change&quot;) won awards for Best Song and Most Broadcast Song. These two songs were covered by artists throughout Asia and Europe. Many of her earlier songs are sung in an angry mood, from the perspective of a rejected lover. These two singles firmly established Lee as one of the top Korean singers who successfully gained popularity throughout Asia with her strong colorful performances.

Ahead of the 2002 general elections, the singer was asked by political parties if they could use &quot;Change&quot; in their campaigns, to which she declined.

Lee released Japanese versions of her early hits &quot;Wa&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot; in December 2004. The single ranked #26 on Oricon chart in Week 3 of January 2005. Heaven was a theme song for the Korean drama &quot;Beautiful Days&quot;. The drama became widely popular in Japan. On December 31, 2004, Lee was invited to perform Heaven and Wa-come on- and participate at the 55th edition of &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve live music show.

Lee was the first foreigner to participate in singing the Beijing Olympic 2008 Theme Song.
In 2008, she released her first Mandarin album with title single &quot;Love Me&quot;.

With her fifth album, &quot;Passion&quot;, she switched to a Latin-influenced sound, complete with Spanish Guitar and flamenco-style tap dance.

In May 2009, she released her first Korean mini album &quot;Avaholic&quot;, featuring a trio of songs, &quot;Crazy,&quot; &quot;Vogue It Girl&quot; and &quot;Miro&quot;. The music video &quot;Crazy&quot; was choreographed by Brian Friedman. In September 2009, she was invited to open at Lady Gaga&#x27;s The Fame Ball Tour in Club Answer, Seoul, South Korea. In December 2009, Lee sung her first ballad for the soundtrack of the Korean TV drama &quot;Iris&quot;. The song, &quot;How Can I Hold Back Tears,&quot; takes her to the ballad genre for the first time in her over 10-year singing career.

In 2010, her seventh album was released on May 11, 2010, with the title song, &quot;Suspicious Man.&quot; In this title single&#x27;s music video, Lee once again showed her dynamic performance range by introducing a vengeful assassin with a short blonde do. The seventh album was entitled, &quot;007th.&quot;

In 2013, she released her single entitled &quot;V&quot;, featuring Jin Goo in a music video directed by Park Chan-wook and Park Chan-kyong, with whom she&#x27;d previously worked on &quot;Night Fishing&quot;.

===Cultural ambassador===

On June 22, 2012, Lee was appointed as an honorary ambassador for the Korea-China Cultural Industry Conference, called CICON.

==Personal life==

During her appearance on &quot;Stars&#x27; Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant&quot;, her husband, whose face was censored due to privacy concerns, was dubbed as &quot;Baby&quot;. His face was eventually revealed on her re-appearance on the show in 2023.

On December 7, 2021, Lee announced that she is pregnant on her YouTube channel. On April 23, 2022, Lee&#x27;s agency confirmed that Lee gave birth to her first daughter, Park Seo-ah, on April 20, 2022.

<text>William Reed Summers (November 10, 1895 – September 12, 1966) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1933 to 1959.

==Early life==
Summers was born in Harrison, New Jersey, and raised in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He left school in the seventh grade, and began working under his father, a mill foreman; he also began boxing as a lightweight, with moderate success in the ring. At age 17, he was employed as a road worker when he stopped to watch a high school baseball game. The umpire who was supposed to officiate never arrived, however, and Summers was asked by Woonsocket high school coach Frank Keaney – who would go on to an extraordinary collegiate coaching career – to fill in. Summers accepted, even though he had never played baseball and was unfamiliar with the rules; Keaney told him that as long as he kept track of balls and strikes, it shouldn&#x27;t prove difficult. Summers proved adept at the task, and regularly officiated high school, semi-pro and industrial games for the next eight years.

==Umpiring career==
In 1921 he got his first chance at the professional ranks when he was hired by the Eastern League, and he continued in the minor leagues through 1932. He joined the American League staff in 1933, during the period when the major leagues were expanding standard umpiring crews from two men per game to three. Over his career, the firmly authoritative Summers proved adept at handling arguments, using his stocky build (5&#x27;8&quot; and 208 pounds (94 kg)) to maximum advantage in defusing potentially explosive situations; he had a &quot;slow thumb&quot;, rarely ejecting anyone from a game without a warning.

Summers umpired in 8 World Series (1936, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1948, 1951, 1955 and 1959), tying the American League record shared by three other arbiters. He was also the first base umpire for the 1948 playoff game that decided the American League pennant, and worked in 7 All-Star Games, setting a record (later tied by Al Barlick): 1936, 1941, 1946, 1949, 1952, 1955 and 1959 (second game). He called balls and strikes in all 7 of the All-Star contests, a mark unmatched by any other umpire. He was the home plate umpire on July 27, 1946, when Rudy York hit two grand slams, and on June 10, 1959, when Rocky Colavito hit four home runs.

Summers was the home plate umpire in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series when Jackie Robinson stole home in the 8th inning, prompting Yankee catcher Yogi Berra to furiously argue his safe call.

Late in his career, during his long tenure on baseball&#x27;s Rules Committee, that body completed a major overhaul of the rule book, revising it entirely into a greatly improved version which organized the rules by logical subsections. In 1955, Summers became the major leagues&#x27; senior umpire in service time; he retired following the 1959 World Series, at age 63 the oldest umpire ever to serve on the American League staff, and later gave clinics and lectures at military bases throughout the world.

==Personal life==
Summers married Mary Ellen Van Riper on April 30, 1917. He died on September 12, 1966, at age 70 at his home in Upton, Massachusetts.

==Quote==
*&quot;I wasn&#x27;t much of an umpire, at first; but I could keep the peace. And that&#x27;s an umpire&#x27;s most important and toughest job.&quot;

<doc id="974068" wikidata="Q468617" url="?curid=974068" title="Sarah, Crown Princess of Brunei">
<text>Sarah binti Salleh Ab. Rahaman (Jawi: سارة; born 9 April 1987) is the wife of the Crown Prince of Brunei, Al-Muhtadee Billah and born as the daughter of a distant member of the royal family. While attending a pre-university course at 17, she married the Crown Prince. The couple have four children.

== Early life and education ==
She was born &quot;Dayangku Sarah binti Pengiran Salleh Ab. Rahaman&quot; at Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital in Bandar Seri Begawan, on 9 April 1987, as the third child and only daughter of Pengiran Salleh Ab. Rahaman Pengiran Damit and Rinawaty Abdullah (&quot;née&quot; Suzanne Aeby). Her father (born 1 June 1950) is a distant member of the royal family and worked as the chief laboratory assistant at the Water Services Division in the Public Works Department. Her mother (born 3 March 1954 in Fribourg, Switzerland) is a nurse who worked in Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital. Her parents met in the United Kingdom in the 1970s while studying. Her two elder brothers are Awangku Irwan and Awangku Adrian.

At the age of six, Dayangku Sarah started attending St. Andrew&#x27;s School for her early education in 1993. She earned a passing grade on the primary certificate of education in 1998. At Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College (MSPSBS), she proceeded with her studies, finishing the lower secondary assessment in 2001 and the Brunei–GCE Ordinary Level in 2003. Al-Muhtadee Billah had previously attended the same college where Dayangku Sarah was enrolled in her pre-university studies in 2004. She studied French in addition to her core disciplines. She also played basketball, and participated in charity runs. Between 7 to 23 May 2002, she traveled to China and Mongolia with her parents and brother on a four-wheel drive international trip. In 2004, she and her college peers participated in a study program at the Belalong Rainforest Field Studies Centre during their school breaks.

In February 2009, Pengiran Anak Sarah became a member of the university&#x27;s army cadets group, joining the women&#x27;s platoon when the university formed its first group of army cadets. She was named the university&#x27;s netball team&#x27;s &quot;most valuable player&quot; in February 2010 after scoring 67 goals and making the final three baskets at the third Ministry of Education Netball Championship, which was played in the Multipurpose Hall of Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium. In November 2009, her performance in the third year of the Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Policy and Administration (English Stream) program earned her one of 140 Book Prizes. Pengiran Anak Sarah graduated with first-class honours at the 22nd convocation of UBD on 30 September 2010, where she was among the 1,114 graduates receiving their degrees in the presence of the sultan and other members of the royal family. She later remarked that transitioning from a science background to one in policy and administration was &quot;extremely tough.&quot;

On 17 April 2011, Pengiran Anak Sarah participated in UBD&#x27;s Jogathon 2011, supporting the female student category. Later, on 29 September, she completed her master&#x27;s degree in Public Policy in English Medium at the 23rd Convocation of UBD.

== Marriage and children ==

On 9 September 2004, while still attending MSPSBS, she married 30-year-old Al-Muhtadee Billah, the Crown Prince, at the age of 17. The event took place at Istana Nurul Iman. Guests included the Duke of Gloucester, the Crown Prince of Japan, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, Princes Bandar bin Sultan and Saud bin Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the King of Bahrain, and several Malaysian sultans. The wedding was also attended by heads of state and government from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The wedding included a &quot;bersanding&quot; ceremony, and a drive around Bandar Seri Begawan in a golden-topped Rolls-Royce.

The royal couple have four children. Their first child and future heir to the Brunei throne, Pengiran Muda Abdul Muntaqim, was born on 17 March 2007 at the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital. Their second child, a daughter, Pengiran Anak Muneerah Madhul Bolkiah, was born on 2 January 2011. Pengiran Anak Sarah gave birth to their third child and second son, Pengiran Muda Muhammad Aiman on 7 June 2015. Their fourth child and second daughter, Pengiran Anak Faathimah Az-Zahraa&#x27; Raihaanul Bolkiah, was born at 15:54, on 1 December 2017.

==Charity work==

Pengiran Anak Sarah has been involved in various charitable causes and community initiatives. At the launch of the Anti-Corruption Bureau&#x27;s drama &quot;Code 486&quot; on 2 April 2006, she emphasised that corruption is a country&#x27;s internal enemy and urged young people to embrace patriotic ideals and refrain from anti-social behaviours. Her message highlighted the importance of integrity and social responsibility in building a stronger nation. Additionally, at the inauguration of the 6th International School Brunei (ISB) Borneo Global Issues Conference (BGIC) on 1 March 2008, she stressed the significance of young people’s involvement in addressing global challenges, particularly environmental issues, and advocated for their active participation in finding solutions to these pressing problems, underscoring their vital role in shaping the future.

On 17 May 2012, during the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day ceremony in Brunei, Pengiran Anak Sarah presented simulated certificates for ICT training to women&#x27;s associations, aiming to enhance their technological skills, a crucial area for personal and professional growth in the modern world. On 11 May 2013, she presided over the launch of Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam&#x27;s ALAF program, a corporate social responsibility initiative dedicated to providing education to impoverished and orphaned children in Brunei, reflecting her commitment to supporting underprivileged communities. Pengiran Anak Sarah’s dedication to youth development was further demonstrated on 10 March 2017, when she emphasised the importance of investing in young people for a sustainable future. At the 13th ISB BGIC, she highlighted the need for responsible development to address challenges like poverty, inequality, and climate change, while also supporting the development of essential life skills such as communication, negotiation, and global awareness.

On 26 May 2023, Pengiran Anak Sarah visited an exhibition during the opening of the Children’s Cancer Foundation centre, where she accepted a drawing from a young cancer survivor, demonstrating her ongoing support for children&#x27;s health and well-being. In addition to her charitable efforts, she has actively participated in sporting events. On 4 August 2024, she competed in the 5th Borneo Run Half Marathon, racing in the women&#x27;s open division and covering a distance of 21.18 kilometres, before awarding prizes to the winners. Later, on 3 November 2024, she presented prizes at the VA Run, recognising the winners of the 10km male and female open categories and supporting Team Peak in placing second in the Corporate 10km category.

Pengiran Anak Sarah is the royal patron of several organisations, including the Brunei Ladies Golf Association and the ISB BGIC.

<doc id="974071" wikidata="Q3091203" url="?curid=974071" title="Ryōichi Sasakawa">
<text>was a Japanese businessman, philanthropist, far-right politician, and suspected war criminal. 

In the 1930s and during the Second World War he was active both in finance and in politics, actively supporting the Japanese war effort including raising his own paramilitary units. He was elected to the Japanese parliament during the war. After Japan&#x27;s defeat he was accused of war crimes and imprisoned for a time. After his release, he found financial success in various business ventures, including motorboat-racing gambling events (&quot;Kyōtei&quot;) and ship building. He supported anticommunist activities, including the World Anti-Communist League. In 1951 he helped found the Nippon Foundation and became its first president. The foundation has done charitable work around the world, for which it and Sasakawa have received many official honors.

== Prewar activity ==
In the 1930s, during the Sino-Japanese War, Sasakawa rose to prominence by using wealth gained in rice speculation to build a voluntary flying squad within Japan for the purpose of providing trained pilots in case of a national emergency. In 1939, Sasakawa flew his air squadron to Rome to meet his personal hero Benito Mussolini, whom he admired as &quot;the perfect fascist and dictator&quot;. He also built an air defense field, donating it to the army. Once Japan began to coordinate its air power in 1941, Sasakawa dissolved his voluntary flying group and gave all of its facilities and aircraft to the nation. In addition, he used the various mining interests that he had accumulated to support the army in a more concrete fashion. Sasaka was more interested in supporting the war effort than making a profit, with one biographer noting that &quot;his family records show ... that his mining ventures were not as profitable in wartime as they could have been&quot;.
In addition, the 1930s saw Sasakawa take the helm of the , or Patriotic People&#x27;s Party (PPP). This small organization was one of the many right-wing groups that sprang up in Japan in the lead-up to World War II. It was in this connection that he first met Yoshio Kodama, who was at that time a member. In 1935, Sasakawa and twelve other leading members of the PPP were arrested and held for three years on suspicion of having ordered the blackmail of several leading companies, such as Takashimaya, the Hankyu Railway, and Tokyo Life Insurance. Though he was eventually acquitted, the jail time and the subsequent appeals process took a total of six years, leading up the opening year of World War II. In the end, the prosecution itself revealed that the charges against him had been based more on perception of the PPP as &quot;dangerous&quot;, than on actual evidence of blackmail.

Sasakawa&#x27;s trials ended in August 1941. In December that year, World War II broke out in the Pacific, and in April 1942, Sasakawa won a seat in the Japanese Diet, taking one of only 85 out of 466 seats that were captured by non-government-backed candidates. The reason that such candidates were so few was that it was wartime, and those in power were doing all they could to control policy while maintaining a mask of parliamentary democracy.

In the Diet, he stood against the government&#x27;s suppression of the freedom of speech and its pressure for the conformity of all parliamentarians. However, his efforts in this vein were largely unsuccessful, and he spent much of the war outside of the Diet, touring Manchuria and China, visiting prisons around the country, and cheering those on the home front.

== Sugamo prison ==

At the end of the war, Sasakawa entered the occupation-run Sugamo prison and spent more than three years there as a suspected war criminal. While until a short time before his arrest, there was little possibility of his detainment, much less as a Class A war crimes suspect, from October to November, 1945, he launched a campaign of twenty or so speeches in Osaka, decrying victor&#x27;s justice and demanding to be taken as a prisoner so that he could help defend Japan in the Tokyo war crimes trials. He was &quot;motivated by a desire to speak out in defense of the emperor and in the interests of Japan at the Tokyo Trials&quot;.

The US summary for his arrest, dated December 4, 1945 reads as follows:
While in prison, Sasakawa was able to establish connections with many of the men who had led Japan during the war, and who would go on to reassume these roles after their release. He also came into further contact with Yoshio Kodama, though the exact nature of their prison relationship does not seem to have been as positive as it had been when they were both members of the PPP. In prison, Kodama pursued a policy of collaborating with his captors, naming names and making questionable statements that put other prisoners at a disadvantage. As part of this policy, he asked that his testimony about Sasakawa be kept secret, and it would appear that Sasakawa never found out about it.

== Postwar activity ==
On December 23, 1948, Hideki Tōjō and six other Class A war criminals were hanged. The next day, all Class A suspects who had not been indicted were released (aside from the seven who were executed, eighteen were given very long or life sentences.) Sasakawa and Kodama were among those who were released. There is much speculation surrounding Sasakawa&#x27;s release. While some suggest that there was simply not enough evidence to indict him of Class A war crimes, others believe it was due to a lack of resources available to carry out trials of all suspected war criminals. The two men subsequently chose different paths in life, but maintained their friendship until the death of Kodama in 1984.

Sasakawa became deeply involved in the post-war reconstruction; though he never again entered politics, he used his considerable influence to bolster business and political parties. The most effective of his post-war activities was the creation of a gambling industry that is still in existence today. Along with his friends Syngman Rhee, the first President of Korea, and Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist leader, he founded the World Anti-Communist League. Among other coups, the league claims to have played a part in the 1966 overthrow of Indonesia&#x27;s President Sukarno. Sasakawa stated once: &quot;I am the world&#x27;s richest fascist.&quot;

Sasakawa supported the controversial Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon (Moonies) in his anti-communist activities. From 1968 to 1972, Sasakawa was the honorary president and patron of the Japanese branch of International Federation for Victory over Communism (Kokusai Shokyo Rengo), which would forge intimate ties with Japan&#x27;s conservative politicians. Allen Tate Wood, a former top American political leader of the Unification Church of the United States, recalled his surprise upon hearing Sasakawa telling an audience, referring to himself, &quot;I am Mr. Moon’s dog&quot;.

Sasakawa helped form the World Union of Karate-do Organizations in 1970, also serving as its president.
In 1980, Sasakawa claimed to have salvaged the wreckage of the Russian cruiser Admiral Nakhimov over the strong protests of the Soviet Government. Sasakawa later publicized photos of what appeared to be a valuable cargo of gold bullion, platinum ingots, and British sovereigns, as well as crates of precious jewels. Sasakawa claimed that the treasure was worth over $36 billion in modern currency, but offered to turn it over to the Soviet Union, in return for the Kuril Islands to Japan. Sasakawa&#x27;s credibility was completely ruined when it turned out that the metal shards he allegedly recovered from aboard the Admiral Nakhimov had the density of lead, but not platinum.

Sasakawa died July 18, 1995. He had three sons: Masatada, Takashi and Yōhei.

== Nippon Foundation ==

In 1951 – after extensive bribery of parliamentarians on its behalf – the Japanese Diet passed the Motorboat Racing Law – an invention of Sasakawa&#x27;s. Under this law, motorboat races are held at 24 locations around the nation for the purpose of both bolstering the local economies and providing the revenue needed to support 1) the reconstruction of Japan&#x27;s maritime industry, and 2) welfare projects around the country. In later years, international projects were also added. The law established that the distribution of the monies to support projects was to be performed by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, a body that eventually came to be known as the Nippon Foundation. Sasakawa became the foundation&#x27;s chairman. Public and governmental focus on the issue drove Sasakawa to take pains to make the system as clear as possible.

&quot;Kyōtei&quot;, a form of state-operated boat-racing betting events, a gambling industry is allowed in Japan, established as a means to help with restoring the nation&#x27;s shipbuilding industry. It was largely responsible for Japan&#x27;s meteoric rise to become one of the world&#x27;s maritime leaders by the 1960s. The system is regulated by the Department of Transport, and many of the foundations Sasakawa later created through grants by The Nippon Foundation were led by previous employees of the Department of Transport. The system of farming out former government employees to businesses and foundations has long been a common, legal practice in Japan, though one that Sasakawa himself viewed with suspicion.

Under Sasakawa&#x27;s leadership, The Nippon Foundation made charitable contributions both in Japan and around the world, working with the United Nations on maritime law and with the World Health Organization, donating over $70m to fight leprosy.

The group also founded or funded a number of other organizations, such as the United States–Japan Foundation; The Sasakawa Peace Foundation; the Sasakawa Africa Association, an expansion of Norman Borlaug&#x27;s Green Revolution to Africa with the help of former US President Jimmy Carter; and the University of Houston&#x27;s Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA). The Nippon Foundation also runs the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund (SYLFF) for university students across the world.

<doc id="974074" wikidata="Q1452569" url="?curid=974074" title="Fred Williamson">
<text>Frederick Robert Williamson (born March 5, 1938), nicknamed &quot;the Hammer&quot;, is an American actor, filmmaker, and former professional football defensive back who played mainly in the American Football League (AFL) during the 1960s. He was a top sports star during the decade, and become a leading man in blaxploitation and action films beginning in the 1970s. 

WIlliamson played in college at Northwestern University, and played in the National Football League (NFL) with the Pittsburgh Steelers for one season. In the AFL, Williamson played with the Oakland Raiders for four seasons, becoming a three-time AFL All-Star (1961, &#x27;62, &#x27;63). He then played three seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, where was a one-time AFL Champion (&#x27;66). During his football career, he earned the nickname &quot;the Hammer&quot; for his aggressive playing style, which incorporated martial arts techniques.

After retiring from football in 1968, Williamson made a string of a guest and supporting roles on television and in films. He played his first leading role in the blaxploitation Western &quot;The Legend of Nigger Charley&quot; (1972), which he reprised in two sequels. He starred as Tommy Gibbs in the 1973 crime drama film &quot;Black Caesar&quot; and its sequel &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;. Williamson also had roles in other 1970s blaxploitation films such as &quot;Hammer&quot; (1972), &quot;That Man Bolt&quot; (1973) and &quot;Three the Hard Way&quot; (1974). Later in the decade, he worked extensively in Italian cinema, and also began to direct and produce his own films.

==Early life and education==
Born in Gary, Indiana, Williamson was the only child born to Frank, a welder and Lydia Williamson. Williamson attended Froebel High School in Gary, where he ran track and played football. He graduated in 1956. After high school, Williamson left Gary to attend Northwestern University on a track and field scholarship, earning a degree in architecture.

An avid martial artist, Williamson holds black belts in Kenpō, Shotokan karate and taekwondo. 

==Professional football career==
After playing college football for Northwestern in the late 1950s, Williamson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the San Francisco 49ers. When during training camp he was switched to their defense, his attitude over the switch prompted him to play his position with too much aggression, and the coach of the 49ers asked him to quit &quot;hammering&quot; his players. Thus, &quot;The Hammer&quot; quickly stuck and became his nickname.

Williamson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers and played one year for the Steelers in the National Football League in 1960. Next, he moved to the new American Football League. Williamson played four seasons for the AFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders, making the AFL All-Star team in 1961, 1962, and 1963. He also played three seasons for the AFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs. During his period of playing for the Chiefs, Williamson became one of football&#x27;s first self-promoters, nurturing the nickname &quot;The Hammer&quot; because he used his forearm to deliver karate-style blows to the heads of opposing players, especially wide receivers. Before Super Bowl I, Williamson garnered national headlines by boasting that he would knock the Green Bay Packers starting receivers, Carroll Dale and Boyd Dowler, out of the game. He stated &quot;Two hammers to Dowler, one to Dale should be enough&quot;.

His prediction turned out to be an ironic one because &quot;they &quot;(Green Bay)&quot; broke the hammer&quot; as Williamson himself was knocked out of the game in the fourth quarter on the way to a 35–10 defeat. Williamson&#x27;s head met the knee of the Packers&#x27; running back Donny Anderson. Williamson later suffered a broken arm from his own teammate when Chiefs linebacker Sherrill Headrick fell on him. Williamson finished his eight-season pro football career in 1967 with a history of many hard tackles, passes knocked away, and 36 pass interceptions in 104 games. Williamson returned his interceptions for 479 yards and two touchdowns. After signing with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League during the 1968 season, but not having played in a league game, Williamson retired.

== Acting career ==

Williamson became an actor much in the mold of star running back Jim Brown. He acted alongside Brown in films such as &quot;Three the Hard Way&quot; (1974), &quot;Take a Hard Ride&quot; (1975), &quot;One Down, Two to Go&quot; (1982), which also featured Jim Kelly. Other films with Brown were &quot;Original Gangstas&quot; (1996) and &quot;On the Edge&quot; (2002). Williamson also guest starred with Brown in various television roles. In October 1973, Williamson posed nude for &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine, preempting Brown&#x27;s appearance in 1974. Williamson&#x27;s early television roles included a role in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Cloud Minders&quot; (1969), in which he played Anka. He also played Diahann Carroll&#x27;s love interest in the sitcom &quot;Julia&quot;. In an interview for the DVD of &quot;Bronx Warriors&quot;, Williamson stated that his role in &quot;Julia&quot; was created for him when he convinced the producers that the Black community was upset that Julia had a different boyfriend every week.

Williamson&#x27;s early film work included roles in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot; (1970). He portrayed an escaped slave who flees westward in &quot;The Legend of Nigger Charley&quot; (1972). He played the role of an African-American gangster in the film &quot;Black Caesar&quot; (1973) and its subsequent sequel, &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot; (also 1973). Williamson also starred in the 1975 western film &quot;Boss Nigger&quot;, in which he played the title role. After this he appeared as an actor in several films, most of which are considered to be of the &quot;blaxploitation&quot; genre. Williamson starred alongside Peter Boyle and Eli Wallach in the movie &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; (1974).

Williamson co-starred in the short-lived series &quot;Half Nelson&quot; (1985). During the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, Williamson frequently appeared on television as a spokesman for King Cobra malt liquor (&quot;Don&#x27;t let the smooth taste fool you.&quot;), as did fellow actor/martial artist Martin Kove. In 1994, Williamson, along with many other black actors from the &#x27;Blaxploitation&#x27; movie era (namely Antonio Fargas, Pam Grier, Rudy Ray Moore, and Ron O&#x27;Neal) made a cameo appearance on Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s music video &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot;, where he appears as himself using his pro-football nickname &quot;The Hammer&quot;. Williamson co-starred with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino in &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996), directed by Robert Rodriguez. He was in the cast of the original &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot; (1978), which would later inspire Tarantino&#x27;s 2009 film of similar name.

Williamson has continued his career as an actor and director into the 21st Century, appearing in the reboot film &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (2004) derived from the 1970s television series.

===&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;===
In 1974, Williamson was hired by the ABC television network to serve as a color commentator on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, replacing Don Meredith, who had left to pursue an acting and broadcasting career at rival network NBC. Williamson was used on a few pre-season broadcasts, but was quickly declared unsuitable by ABC. He was relieved of his duties at the beginning of the regular season, becoming the first &quot;MNF&quot; personality not to endure for an entire season. He was replaced by the fellow former player (and fellow Gary, Indiana, native) Alex Karras.

===Working with clique of actors===
Williamson has co-starred in a number of films with Bo Svenson. They include, &quot;The Inglorious Bastards&quot; (1978), &quot;Deadly Impact&quot; (1984), &quot;Delta Force Commando&quot; (1987), &quot;The Kill Reflex&quot; (1989), &quot;Three Days to a Kill&quot; (1991), and &quot;Steele&#x27;s Law&quot; (1991)

===Directing and producing===
Since the 1970s, Williamson has had another career as a director and producer. His first film as producer was &quot;Boss Nigger&quot; (1975), in which he also starred. His second film as producer was with &quot;Mean Johnny Barrows&quot; (1976), a predecessor of the &quot;Rambo&quot; films which similarly featured a violent Vietnam Vet plot (though the novel &quot;First Blood&quot; on which the film &quot;First Blood&quot; was based was written in 1972). He has since directed over 20 features. In the middle of the 1970s, Williamson relocated to Rome, Italy and formed his own company Po&#x27; Boy Productions, which started to produce actioners including &quot;Adios Amigo&quot; (1976) and &quot;Death Journey&quot; (1976), both of which starred and were directed by Williamson. Although his most recent efforts as director and producer have mainly been direct-to-video, Williamson remains an active film maker.

==Personal life==
Williamson has been married twice. His first marriage was to Ginette Lavonda from 1960 until 1967. Williamson has been married to Linda Williamson since 1988. Williamson has at least three children but some sources state he has at least six. Since 1997, Williamson has had a home in Palm Springs, California.

In June 2020, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; reported that Williamson had allegedly attempted to grope an assistant costume designer during a wardrobe fitting. He denied the charge.

<text>The Personal Rule (also known as the Eleven Years&#x27; Tyranny) was the period in England from 1629 to 1640 when King Charles I ruled as an autocratic absolute monarch without recourse to Parliament. Charles claimed that he was entitled to do this under the royal prerogative and that he had a divine right.

Charles had already dissolved three Parliaments by the third year of his reign in 1628. After the murder of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who was deemed to have a negative influence on Charles&#x27; foreign policy, Parliament began to criticize the king more harshly than before. Charles then realised that, as long as he could avoid war, he could rule without the need of Parliament.

== Names ==
Whig historians such as S. R. Gardiner called this period the &quot;Eleven Years&#x27; Tyranny&quot;, because they interpret Charles&#x27;s actions as highly authoritarian and a contributing factor to the instability that eventually led to the English Civil War. More recent historians such as Kevin Sharpe called the period &quot;Personal Rule&quot;, because they consider it to be a more neutral term, and some such as Sharpe have argued that there were some positive aspects of the period.

==Background==
In the medieval period, government in England was very much centred on the king. He ruled personally, usually assisted by his council, the &quot;curia regis&quot;. The council members were chosen by the king, and its membership varied greatly, but members often included powerful nobility and churchmen, senior civil servants, and sometimes certain members of the king&#x27;s friends and family.

Early parliaments began to emerge under Edward I, who wished to implement taxation changes and wide-ranging law reforms, and sought to gain the consent of the nobility. Nevertheless, calling a parliament was an expensive and time-consuming process, requiring many personal invitations (for the House of Lords) and elections in the shires and chartered cities and boroughs. So parliaments would only be summoned on particularly important occasions. Once a parliament had finished its business, the king would dissolve it, and perhaps not summon another for an extended period; in the meantime, the &quot;curia regis&quot; – that is, the king with his chosen advisers – would make laws (&quot;ordinances&quot;), spend money, and carry on the business of government.

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, the acknowledged powers of Parliament grew. In particular, it was established that Parliament was the only body that could authorise nationwide taxation and excise. There were practical underpinnings to these powers, for those who elected representatives to Parliament at this time were the same people the monarch had to rely on to collect and remit taxes on a large scale: the landed gentry. If a sovereign were to attempt to impose new taxes without consulting the gentry then the gentry could have simply refused to collect the taxes, and the monarch would have had little feasible recourse.

Once summoned, a parliament could take the opportunity to submit policy proposals to the monarch (&quot;bills&quot;), which would be expected to take precedence over ordinances if signed into law by the monarch, although the monarch was under no obligation to grant the Royal Assent to any such proposal. However, monarchs did increasingly use parliaments more widely in lawmaking as a way of gaining popular support for their policies. One example was during the English Reformation, when the Reformation Parliament acting at Henry VIII&#x27;s instigation passed a succession of laws regulating the church in England.

The first of the Stuart monarchs to rule England, James I, was perennially short of money and he was obliged to summon parliaments often. Successive parliaments thereupon sought to turn the king&#x27;s financial woes to their advantage, requiring various policy concessions before voting taxes. In 1625, James was succeeded by his son Charles I, who immediately plunged England into an expensive and ultimately unsuccessful war with Spain, in an attempt to force the Catholic King Philip IV of Spain to intercede with Emperor Ferdinand II on behalf of Charles&#x27;s brother-in-law Frederick V, Elector Palatine, to regain the Electorate of the Palatinate and his hereditary lands, which Ferdinand had revoked from him.

Parliament&#x27;s protests about the war&#x27;s mismanagement by the Duke of Buckingham, and others of Charles&#x27; policies, primarily regarding taxation and other methods of acquiring funds, and Charles&#x27; refusal to compromise, eventually led to Charles dissolving Parliament in March 1629. He also made peace with Spain and France, largely because the financial burden of waging these wars could not be sustained without funds that Parliament alone could provide. For the next eleven years, Charles governed with only an advisory council of royal appointees.

==The start of Personal Rule==
There has been considerable historiographical debate about the beginnings of Personal Rule, with some historians favouring a &quot;high road&quot; approach, like Christopher Hill which assesses the long-term causes of Personal Rule such as Stuart financial problems, religious issues (see James VI and I and religious issues and English Reformation) and problems of state development. Other historians favour a &quot;low road&quot; approach, which blames problems immediately caused by Charles, such as the promotion of anti-Calvinist clergy to positions of authority (like Richard Montagu to the role of one of Charles&#x27; personal chaplains), reckless spending on the wars in France and Spain and the corrosive influence of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham on relations between monarch and Parliament.

Ultimately, due to a combination of factors, the relationship between Charles and Parliament became unworkable, with both sides entrenched in conflict. Great debate had erupted over Darnell&#x27;s Case (also known as the Five Knights Case), leading to the passing of the Petition of Right into statute law. This Act of Parliament, despite being given Royal assent by Charles, offended the Royal Prerogative deeply; the monarch was restricted from imprisonment habeas corpus, as well as imposing taxation without Parliamentary consent. Both Charles&#x27; obstinate attitude, as well as Parliament&#x27;s recalcitrance led to the dissolution of Parliament in 1629.

All of this tension came to a head in early 1629. Sir John Eliot, the leader of the opposition to the King, announced a protestation known as the Three Resolutions. These resolutions denounced perceived Arminianism in the Church of England, as well as calling upon merchants to refuse to pay tonnage and poundage. In response to this, on 10 March 1629, Sir John Finch (the Speaker of the House of Commons) attempted to adjourn the House of Commons on the King&#x27;s command. However, he was prevented from rising from his seat to give this edict by three MPs – John Eliot, Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles and Benjamin Valentine – until the Three Resolutions had been passed. No formal vote took place on these resolutions, but members shouted their approval instead. The Commons then voted for its own adjournment. Furious, the King announced the dissolution of Parliament on 10 March 1629.

==Finances==
The greatest problem Charles initially encountered at this stage was a continued lack of funds. The main sources of income for the King were customs duties, feudal dues and income from the King&#x27;s personal estates. Nationwide taxation was widely understood to be for emergencies and special purposes, such as war, and it was by this time generally accepted that only Parliament could authorise a general tax. But even in peacetime, the traditional sources of the King&#x27;s revenue were stretched to the limit to fund the business of government. So Charles and his advisers developed various schemes to raise additional revenue without recourse to Parliament.

A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckingham&#x27;s short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister, Elizabeth, and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the &quot;Distraint of Knighthood&quot;, in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king&#x27;s coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626.

The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than tonnage and poundage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king&#x27;s prerogative, though some of them had reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.

The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies, despite a statute forbidding such action, which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s. Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation (1625), whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent. In addition, the boundaries of the royal forests in England were extended to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the re-asserted boundaries for encroachment.

Sales of Royal lands, especially the large expanses of under-developed Royal forests also contributed to finances. Courtiers were asked to survey the lands, to provide programmes to disafforest these areas. The focus of the programme was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for development as pasture and arable, or in the case of the Forest of Dean, development for the iron industry. This included providing compensation to people using the lands in common, especially manorial lords and their tenants. Others who had settled illegally were not entitled to compensation and frequently rioted. The discontent following a major wave of sales included what was known as the Western Rising, but extended beyond, for instance to riots in Feckenham Forest and Malvern Chase.

The practice of granting extensive monopolies agitated the public, who were forced to pay higher prices by the monopoly holders. Against the background of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in the summer of 1640 as parliament continued to refuse new taxes. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances further refused to make any loans to the king, and likewise he was unable to subscribe any foreign loans. In this extremity, Charles seized the money held in trust at the mint of the Exchequer in the tower of London. The royal mint held a monopoly on the exchange of foreign coin and from this the mint operated as a bank containing much capital of the merchants and goldsmiths of the city. In July, Charles seized all £130,000 of this money, and in August he followed it up by seizing all the stocks of pepper held by the East India Company, and selling it at distress prices.

On the other side of the ledger, the government tried to reduce expenditure, especially by avoiding war (thus pursuing an isolationist foreign policy) and also avoiding large-scale innovations on the domestic front. Of equal importance, Charles learned to spend less extravagantly compared to his father.

==Religion during Personal Rule==
Without the influence of Parliament, the Caroline government was able to exert a much greater force on the Church. During Personal Rule, there was a noticeable shift in the Church of England towards a more sacramental and ceremonialist direction. The appointment of William Laud to the role of Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 signalled this shift most of all. One of Charles&#x27; main concerns was the liturgical and religious unity of his Three Kingdoms. His government tried to squash dissent legalistically, by making use of the Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber. One very prominent example of this was the punishment of three dissenters – William Prynne, Henry Burton (theologian) and John Bastwick – in 1637; they were pilloried, whipped and mutilated by cropping and then imprisoned indefinitely for their publication and authorship of anti-episcopal pamphlets.

Liturgical shifts were important to the theology of Laud. A greater insistence on the usage of the Book of Common Prayer in all services (which was enforced by episcopal visitation); the placement of the altar at the east end of the Church; and kneeling for the reception of the sacrament were all hallmarks of Laudian liturgy. This was all encompassed within a policy called &#x27;the beauty of holiness&#x27; (this phrase coming from Psalm 96), which described how Christian worship should be couched in ceremony and splendour to further devotion. Foreshadowing debates that would later emerge over clerical dress, Laud also imposed a rule which decreed all ministers should wear a surplice when performing a service. All of these reforms and changes were often criticised by Puritan and other opponents as a return to popery and the vicious influence of Roman Catholicism returning to a semi-reformed English Church.

Whilst opposition from the Church of Scotland as well as radical Puritans was strong and consistent throughout Personal Rule, there was little opposition from the English population at large. Indeed, the Church was generally accepted as becoming more ceremonial in its style of worship, such as through the acceptance of the installation of Laudian altar rails. It is estimated that as many as three-quarters of England&#x27;s parish churches had altar rails installed by 1639. However, much of this ceremonial progress was undone by Parliamentary decree upon the calling of the Long Parliament, which ordered the destruction of all altar rails in 1641.

Historians generally agree that Laudian reforms were divisive, but disagree over the salience of religious issues in the bringing about of the end of Personal Rule. John Morrill argued that, &#x27;it is impossible to overestimate the damage done by the Laudians&#x27;. Other historians, like David Smith and Ian Gentles argue similarly the primacy of religious issues in the coming of the downfall of Personal Rule, as well as the start of the Civil War in general. However, historians like John Adamson stress the importance of constitutional, short-term issues like the trial and execution of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford as the most important context for the outbreak of Civil War. There can be little denial of the importance of religion in the contentions within Personal Rule. The attempts to instil religious conformity, especially in Scotland, generated opposition and drove the impetus towards the calling of the Short Parliament, and then the Long Parliament. The Bishops&#x27; Wars were a direct consequence of the attempt to impose the English Book of Common Prayer on the Scottish Kirk, and Charles&#x27; defeat here signalled the necessity to end Personal Rule before such a war could break out in England (as it would in 1642).

==End==
The Personal Rule began to unravel in 1637, when Charles, along with his advisor Archbishop Laud, attempted to reform the then-episcopal Church of Scotland to bring it into line, especially in its liturgy, with the Church of England. This met with widespread political opposition in Scotland and, by June 1639, Scottish and English armies faced off on the border. Though this was resolved by a truce, relations soon broke down again and Charles resolved to regain his authority in Scotland by force. To pay English troops to fight the Scots, he was advised to call a new parliament. This ended the Personal Rule, but the new body which assembled was unwilling to raise the taxes needed to finance war with Scotland and Charles dissolved it after only a few weeks. In the months which followed, the Scots invaded, defeated the English army and occupied parts of Northern England. With no other routes left to him, the king summoned what became known as the Long Parliament. After reaching a settlement with the Scots, the new parliamentary leaders turned their attention to domestic matters and demanded from Charles ever more sweeping concessions over government policy. In January 1642, Charles left London to raise an army and regain control by force initiating the English Civil War.

<text>The Soviet Union national football team () was the national football team who represented the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1992.

After the breakup of the Union the team was transformed into the CIS national football team. FIFA and UEFA considers the CIS national football team (and ultimately, the Russia national football team) as the Soviet successor team allocating its former records to them (except for the Olympic records which are not combined due to the IOC policy); nevertheless, a large percentage of the team&#x27;s former players came from outside the Russian SFSR, mainly from the Ukrainian SSR, and following the breakup of the Soviet Union, some such as Andrei Kanchelskis from the former Ukrainian SSR, continued to play in the new Russia national football team.

The Soviet Union failed to qualify for the World Cup only twice, in 1974 and 1978, and attended seven finals tournaments in total. Their best finish was fourth in 1966, when they lost to West Germany in the semifinals, 2–1. The Soviet Union qualified for five European Championships, winning the inaugural competition in 1960 when they beat Yugoslavia in the final, 2–1. They finished second three times (1964, 1972, 1988), and fourth once (1968), when, having drawn with Italy in the semi-final, they were sent to the third-place playoff match by the loss of a coin toss. The Soviet Union national team also participated in a number of Olympic tournaments earning the gold medal in 1956 and 1988. The Soviet team continued to field its national team players in Olympic tournaments despite the prohibition of FIFA in 1958 to field any national team players in Olympics (players in the Olympics were required to be amateurs at the time, the Soviets effectively bent the rules by listing their best players in the military).

==History==
===First games===

Because of the circumstances, surrounding October Revolution and later the 1917–1922 Russian Civil War, Soviet Russia was internationally diplomatically isolated, making it unable to participate in the international competitions. In 1922, founded the Bolshevik state of the Soviet Union. After the civil war, the Soviet Union managed to establish international communication with politically similar factions in Europe and around the globe. The Soviet Union joined the Red Sport International proclaiming any sports events outside of the RSI to be &quot;part of the bourgeoisie&quot;.

The first international match played by a Soviet team (as the Russian SFSR) came in September 1922, when the Finnish Workers&#x27; Sports Federation football team toured Russia (Russia formed the Soviet Union at the end of December 1922, Treaty on the Creation of the USSR). The Soviet Russia XI scored a 4–1 victory over the Finns in Petrograd. This was also the first international contact for Soviet sports after the 1917 October Revolution. In May 1923, the Soviet team visited Finland and beat the Finnish squad 5–0. The first match against national team was played in August 1923, nine months after the establishment of the Soviet Union, when a Russian SFSR team beat Sweden 2–1 in Stockholm.

The first match as the actual Soviet Union football team took place a year later, a 3–0 win over Turkey. This and a return match in Ankara were the only officially recognised international matches played by the Soviet Union prior to the 1952 Summer Olympics, though several unofficial friendlies against Turkey took place in the 1930s. The 1952 Olympics was the first competitive tournament entered by the Soviet Union. In the preliminary round, Bulgaria were defeated 2–1, earning a first-round tie against Yugoslavia. Before the match, both Tito and Stalin sent telegrams to their national teams, which showed just how important it was for the two heads of state. Yugoslavia led 5–1, but a Soviet comeback in the last 15 minutes resulted in a 5–5 draw. The match was replayed, Yugoslavia winning 3–1. The defeat to the archrivals hit Soviet football hard, and after just three games played in the season, CSKA Moscow, who had made up most of the USSR squad, was forced to withdraw from the league and later disbanded. Furthermore, Boris Arkadiev, who coached both USSR and CSKA, was stripped of his Merited Master of Sports of the USSR title.

===Sweden trials and the triumph===
The Soviet Union, coached by Gavriil Khachalin, entered the World Cup for the first time at the 1958 tournament, following a qualification playoff against Poland. Drawn in a group with Brazil, England, and Austria, they collected three points in total, one from England and two from Austria. The Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game, in which Anatoli Ilyin scored in the 67th minute to knock England out. The Soviet Union was then eliminated by the hosts of the tournament, Sweden, in the quarter-finals.

The inaugural European Championships in 1960 marked the pinnacle of Soviet footballing achievement. Easily progressing to the quarter-finals, the team were scheduled to face Spain, but due to the tensions of the Cold War, Spain refused to travel to the Soviet Union, resulting in a walkover. In the semi-final, the Soviet team defeated Czechoslovakia 3–0 and reached the final, where they faced Yugoslavia.

In the final, Yugoslavia scored first, but the Soviet Union, led by legendary goalkeeper Lev Yashin, equalized in the 49th minute. After 90 minutes the score was 1–1, and Viktor Ponedelnik scored with seven minutes left in extra time to give the Soviets the inaugural European Championship.

===The end of Kachalin&#x27;s dream-team===

In the 1962 World Cup, the Soviet team was in Group 1 with Yugoslavia, Colombia, and Uruguay. The match between the Soviet Union and Colombia ended 4–4; Colombia scored a series of goals (68&#x27;, 72&#x27;, 86&#x27;). The Soviets topped the group, but again were knocked out by the hosts on the quarter finals. Star goalkeeper Lev Yashin was in poor form both against Colombia and Chile. His form was considered one of the main reasons why the Soviet Union team did not gain more success in the tournament.

In 1964, the Soviet Union attempted to defend their European Championship title, defeating Italy in the last 16 (2–0, 1–1) and to reach the quarter-finals. After two matches against Sweden, the Soviet side won on aggregate (1–1, 3–1). The Soviet Union team went to Spain where the finals were held. In the semi-finals, the Soviet Union defeated Denmark 3–0 in Barcelona but their dreams of winning the title again were dashed in the final when Spain, the host, scored a late goal, winning 2–1.

===The late 1960s: Semi-finals at World Cup and European Championships===
The 1966 FIFA World Cup was the tournament in which the Soviet Union team reached their best result by finishing in fourth place. The Soviet Union was in Group 4 with North Korea, Italy and Chile. In all three matches, the Soviet Union team managed to defeat their rivals. The Soviet team then defeated Hungary in the quarter-finals thanks to the effective performance of their star, Lev Yashin but their success was ended by two defeats on 25 and 28 July, against West Germany in the semi-finals and Portugal in the third-place playoff match, respectively. The 1966 squad was the second-best scoring Soviet team in World Cup history, with 10 goals.

For the Euro 1968, the qualification competition was played in two stages; a group stage (taking place from 1966 until 1968) and the quarter-finals (played in 1968). Again, only four teams could reach the finals which were held in Italy. The semi-final match between the Soviet Union and Italy ended 0–0. It was decided to toss a coin to see who reached the final, rather than play a replay. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. On 8 June 1968, the Soviets were defeated by England in the third-place match.

===Kachalin&#x27;s second attempt===
The 1970 World Cup started with the match between Mexico and the Soviet Union. The Soviet team became the first team to make a substitution in World Cup history in this match. Other opponents in their group were Belgium and El Salvador. The Soviet team easily qualified to the quarter-final where they lost against Uruguay in extra time. This was the last time the Soviet Union reached the quarter-finals.

The final tournament of the 1972 European Championships took place between 14 and 18 June 1972. Again, only four teams were in the finals. The Soviets defeated Hungary 1–0, with a second-half goal. The final was between West Germany and the Soviet Union. The match ended with a victory of the German side thanks to the effective football of Gerd Müller. This tournament was one of the two tournaments in which the Soviet Union finished as runner-up.

===Failures to qualify in the 1970s===

After being runners up at Euro 1972, the rest of the 1970s were bleak for the Soviets, who were disqualified from the 1974 World Cup as a result of a refusal to play Chile in the aftermath of the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état and failed to qualify for the 1978 World Cup or the 1976 and 1980 European Championships.

===Beskov recovers the team===

The 1982 World Cup was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first major tournament appearance for a decade. The Soviet Union was in Group 6 with Brazil, Scotland, and New Zealand. Goals by Sócrates and Éder Aleixo marked the defeat of the Soviet side against Brazil in the first group match and they were eventually eliminated in the second round by finishing the group in second place when they defeated Belgium only 1–0 and drew against Poland with an 0–0 results. In 1984, the Soviets again failed to qualify for the European Championships, but succeeded in qualifying for the 1986 World Cup. The Soviet Union was in Group C with Hungary, France, and Canada. The Soviets used Irapuato, Guanajuato as their training ground in the World Cup.

The Soviet team enjoyed a successful group stage by scoring nine goals and finishing the group in first place. Ultimately, however, they lost to Belgium 3–4 after extra time in the round of 16. Despite their poor performance in the cup, this team was the best scoring Soviet team in World Cup history, with 12 goals.

===Lobanovsky era and demise of Soviet Union===
After failing to qualify for three consecutive European Cups (1976, 1980, 1984), the Soviets managed to qualify for the 1988 competition, the last time the Soviet Union national football team took part in the European Football Championship. The finals were held in West Germany, with eight teams participating. Soviet Union finished Group B as leaders above the Netherlands and defeated Italy 2–0 in the semi-final. In the final against the Netherlands, another team from Group B, the Netherlands avenged their group stage defeat, winning by a score of 2–0 to be crowned European champions.

The final major championship contested by the Soviet team was the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where they were drawn in Group B with Argentina, Romania and Cameroon. The only success for the Soviets came when they defeated group leaders Cameroon 4–0. The Soviets lost their other matches and failed to qualify from the group, the only time in their World Cup history this happened. The Soviet Union qualified for Euro 1992, but the breakup of the Soviet Union meant that their place was instead taken by the CIS national football team, composed of newly independent Soviet republics. After the tournament, the former Soviet republics competed as separate independent nations, with FIFA allocating the Soviet team&#x27;s record to Russia.

<text>Caroline Graham (born 17 July 1931) is an English playwright, screenwriter and novelist.

==Early life and education==
Graham was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire to a working-class family, and attended Nuneaton High School for Girls where her English teacher encouraged her to write. Graham&#x27;s mother died when she was six and her father remarried when she was 13. At the age of 14, she left school and went to work in Courtaulds Mill as a wefter.

She served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service from 1953 to 1955 but eventually ran away because she hated it. She met up with her airforce penpal, Graham Cameron, whom she later married. The couple moved to France, living in a mews house at Versailles where Cameron was stationed as part of his work for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe. She had attended ballet school for three years during their stay in France. After some time, they relocated to Lincoln, England where Graham spent three days a week in London at drama school. They later split up, with Graham moving to London. There, she met a new partner and became pregnant with her son, David.

She studied with the Open University, and in 1991 received a master&#x27;s degree in theatre studies from the University of Birmingham at the age of 60.

==Career==
Her first published book was &quot;Fire Dance&quot; (1982), a romance novel. She is best known as the writer of the &quot;Chief Inspector Barnaby&quot; series, dramatised for television as &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. The first Inspector Barnaby novel, &quot;The Killings at Badger&#x27;s Drift&quot;, was published in 1987. The novel was well received by the mystery community and was named by the Crime Writers&#x27; Association as one of &quot;The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time&quot;. It also won the 1989 Macavity Award for &quot;Best First Novel&quot; and was nominated for the same honour at the 1989 Anthony Awards and the 1988 Agatha Awards.

Since &quot;The Killings at Badger&#x27;s Drift&quot;, Graham has written six more Inspector Barnaby novels; the last, &quot;A Ghost in the Machine&quot;, was published in 2004. The first five Inspector Barnaby novels formed the basis of the first five episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. She has also written for the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. She has appeared in a series on detective writers titled &quot;Super Sleuths&quot; (2006), appeared in one episode of &quot;The People&#x27;s Detective&quot; (2010), as well as appearing in episode 3 of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. As of 2011, she was writing a novel set in the 1890s.

<text>Penknife, or pen knife, is a small folding knife. Today &quot;penknife&quot; is also the common British English term for both a pocketknife, which can have single or multiple blades, and for multi-tools, with additional tools incorporated into the design.

==History==
Originally, penknives were used for thinning and pointing quills (cf. &quot;penna&quot;, Latin for &quot;feather&quot;) to prepare them for use as dip pens and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the nib. A penknife might also be used to sharpen a pencil, prior to the invention of the pencil sharpener. In the mid-1800s, penknives were necessary to slice the uncut edges of newspapers and books.

A penknife did not necessarily have a folding blade, but might resemble a scalpel or chisel by having a short, fixed blade at the end of a long handle.

During the 20th century there has been a proliferation of multi-function pocketknives with assorted blades and gadgets, the most famous of which is the Swiss Army knife, referred to in British English as penknives.

A larger folding knife than a penknife, especially one in which the blade locks into place as a protection, as for skinning animals, is referred to by some as a claspknife.

In 2015, the club relocated and changed its name to Newcastle Thunder. In 2024, the Newcastle Thunder made a return to Gateshead as their playing base. For 2025 they will play their home games at Crow Trees Ground in Swalwell, home of Blaydon RFC. The club currently competes in League 1, the third tier of rugby league in the United Kingdom.

==History==
The club was formed by the Thunder 2000 working group, formed by supporters of the original Gateshead Thunder after that organisation made the decision to merge with Hull Sharks at the end of the 1999 season. The new club, like the former club, played their home games at Gateshead International Stadium, also the home ground of Gateshead F.C. The Thunder entered the Northern Ford Premiership for the 2001 season; however, they struggled to compete, and eventually finished 17th out of the 19 clubs.

Gateshead continued to struggle in the following season, finishing bottom of the league in 2002. When the Northern Ford Premiership was split into two divisions for the 2003 season the club joined National League Two, and again finished in the bottom two, being kept off the bottom only by new entrants London Skolars. The club&#x27;s fortunes began to improve in 2005, a seventh-place finish being enough to gain a first ever place in the play-offs, before losing to Workington Town in their first ever play-off game. The club again finished seventh in 2006, but went on to lose 46–18 to Featherstone Rovers in the play-offs.

In 2008 the club won its first silverware, finishing the season as League 1 champions. As champions, the club were promoted to the Championship, and avoided on-field relegation by finishing seventh under coach Steve McCormack. Thunder&#x27;s joy at securing a second season in the second tier was however short-lived, as the club was wound up following a dispute between the directors. A new company was formed to continue the club, however the club had to restart as a Championship 1 side, effectively being relegated for the 2010 season.
Gateshead Thunder were taken over by the owners of rugby union side Newcastle Falcons in 2015. The club was rebranded as Newcastle Thunder and applied for permission to use Kingston Park in Newcastle as their home ground.

Further silverware was earned in 2016, when Newcastle defeated North Wales Crusaders to win the League 1 Shield

On 10 December 2020, Thunder were promoted to the Championship by a committee to replace Leigh who were, in turn, promoted to Super League to replace Toronto Wolfpack, who went out of business. Newcastle began playing in the 2021 Championship season.

For the 2022 season, Newcastle announced they were adopting the full time professional model in order to aid promotion to the Super League. This lasted for one year with the club reverting back to part time semi professional status for 2023. 

Following the 2023 RFL Championship season, Newcastle were relegated to League One after winning five of 27 matches. On 13 October 2023, the club announced that they had withdrawn from League One for the 2024 season. A club statement said &quot;Unfortunately, the impact of COVID-19, combined with the low levels of regional growth and development in the game, means it just isn&#x27;t feasible to continue.&quot; An attempt to revive the club was immediately launched under former chairman, Keith Christie. Despite an application to rejoin the league not having been accepted by the RFL, the RFL did include the club in the fixture lists for the 1895 Cup and the 2024 League One season when these were announced at the start of December 2023. In December 2023 the RFL approved the club&#x27;s change of ownership and confirmed Newcastle&#x27;s participation in the 2024 season competitions.

On 16 May 2024, the club announced that it would return to the Gateshead International Stadium for the rest of the 2024 season.

For 2025 the club moved to play at the Crow Trees Ground, home of Blaydon RFC.

<doc id="974115" wikidata="Q88947" url="?curid=974115" title="Renegade (video game)">
<text>, released as Renegade in the West, is a beat &#x27;em up video game developed by Technōs Japan and distributed by Taito for the arcades in 1986. In the original Japanese version &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;, the game revolves around a high-school delinquent named Kunio-kun (or just Kunio) who must stand up against a series of rival gangs frequently targeting his classmate Hiroshi. In the Western version &quot;Renegade&quot;, the player controls a street brawler who must face four different gangs in order to rescue his girlfriend being held captive by a mob boss.

Created by Yoshihisa Kishimoto, the game was semi-autobiographical, partly based on his own teenage high school years getting into daily fights, with Kunio partly based on himself. He also drew inspiration from the Bruce Lee martial arts film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), which inspired the game&#x27;s &quot;knock-down-drag-out&quot; fights, along with his own altercations as a youth. In order to make the game more appealing for the West, Technos produced a graphically-altered version with a visual style inspired by the 1979 film &quot;The Warriors&quot;, changing the looks of some of the game&#x27;s characters and scenery.

It was an important game that defined the beat &#x27;em up genre, establishing the standard gameplay format adopted by later games in the genre. In contrast to earlier side-scrolling martial arts games such as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; introduced key elements such as the belt scroll format where players can move horizontally and vertically in a scrolling arena-like space, a combat system incorporating combo attacks, the standard three-button control scheme, and a street brawling theme. It was the basis for Kishimoto&#x27;s next game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987), which further advanced and popularized its beat &#x27;em up genre format.

The game was ported to a variety of game consoles and home computer platforms. &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; was the first game in the long-running &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; series in Japan. The game&#x27;s Western localization &quot;Renegade&quot; also spawned its own spin-off series from British company Ocean Software on home computers, with the sequels &quot;&quot; (1988) and &quot;Renegade III: The Final Chapter&quot; (1989).

==Gameplay==

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, with character sprites and backgrounds rendered in a three-quarter perspective, and the player able to move in horizontal and vertical directions around the arena. The arcade game is controlled by a joystick and three action buttons, for punch, kick and jump. Compared to other side-scrolling games in its time, the combat system was more highly developed, with the player able to punch, kick, grab, charge, throw and stomp enemies. It also introduced the use of combo attacks; in contrast to earlier games, the opponents in &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; could take much more punishment, requiring a succession of punches, with the first hit temporarily immobilizing the enemy, making him unable to defend himself against successive punches.

===Controls===
The player controls a fighter (in the NES version, he is named &quot;Mr. K&quot; in-game, and &quot;Renegade&quot; in the instruction manual) who must fight a variety of street gangs on the way to save his girlfriend from the gangsters. The controls consists of an eight-way joystick and three actions buttons; left attack, jump and right attack. Unlike previous beat-&#x27;em-ups such as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), &quot;Shao-lin&#x27;s Road&quot; (1985) or &quot;My Hero&quot; (1985), in which the player character&#x27;s movement was limited to only left or right, in &quot;Renegade&quot; the player can also move towards or away from the background by pressing up or down in a matter similar to Technos Japan&#x27;s 1985 wrestling game &quot;Mat Mania&quot;, although the battle system is still limited to only two directions. Pressing the attack button of the character&#x27;s current direction will cause him to throw punches, while the opposite attack button causes him to perform a rear kick instead. When certain enemies are stunned after a few punches or a single kick, the player character can approach him for a collar grab and kick him repeatedly with the front attack button or perform a shoulder throw with the opposite attack button. While jumping, the player can press either attack button for a jump kick towards that particular direction.

Pressing the joystick left or right twice quickly will cause the player to run, at which point pressing the front attack button will perform a running punch, jumping will automatically perform a flying kick, and the rear attack button will bring the player to a sudden halt and perform a back-kick. Pressing down over a fallen enemy will make the player sit on top of them, at which point pressing the front attack will cause the player to pummel them. All of the boss characters (with the exception of Sabu) can only be sat on or put on a collar grab if their health is low enough, otherwise they will push the player off.

The player has a limited amount of lives (which vary depending on the game&#x27;s DIP settings) and no continues to complete the game. The player loses a life if they run out of health after sustaining too many enemy attacks, get knocked off the subway platform or into the sea in the first two stages or fail to complete the stage under the time limit. Health is automatically recovered at the start of each stage. Stages 2 and 4 are the only stages to have checkpoints in the middle of them.

===Stages===
Unlike Technos&#x27; subsequent game &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, the playing field is limited to a series of three-screen-wide areas and does not scroll continuously. The first three stages (a subway platform, a harbor and a street alley) each take place in a single area where the player must face against a gang of seven underlings with their boss watching from the background. The gang of the first two stages consists of two types of underlings: an armed thug who is easier to defeat, and an unarmed thug who can take more punishment and can grab the player character from behind.

When only three underlings remain (in any combination of the two) their boss will come in from the sidelines and join the fight. When the boss (Jack in the first stage, Joel in the second) is defeated, any remaining underling will retreat off the bottom of the screen, and the stage ends. Each boss character has their own health displayed underneath the player&#x27;s. The second stage follows this same formula, but begins with a series of enemies riding motorcycles trying to run the player down. Once a certain number of bikers have been defeated (which vary depending on the difficulty level), the normal enemies will begin to face the player. The third stage features an all female gang. Like the first two gangs, the female gang also consists of two type of underlings: a weaker chain-wielding blond-haired type and a more resistant mace-wielding redhead type. The female gang leader (Kim) is a large woman who can easily grab and slap the player around. She is the only enemy in the game who cannot be put into a collar grab. The fourth and final stage consists of two areas and only has one type of underling, a bald knife-wielding hitman who can kill the player with a single stab. The first area is set in a parking lot where the player must fight against four of these hitmen. Once this first wave of enemies have been defeated, the player character automatically proceeds to enter a building at the far right of the stage. Inside, he faces three more knife-wielding underlings and the final boss, a handgun-wielding mobster (Sabu) who can kill the player with a single shot. Once the final boss is defeated, the main character exits the building and is greeted by his rescued girlfriend, who proceeds to give him a kiss. The game then begins the next loop with an increased difficulty.

==Development==
The game was created by Yoshihisa Kishimoto. He previously worked at Data East, where he created the successful laserdisc games &quot;Cobra Command&quot; (1984) and &quot;Road Blaster&quot; (1985). Data East&#x27;s competitor Technōs Japan was a fan of his work and were interested in entering the laserdisc game business, so they called him for a meeting. Kishimoto instead pitched a different idea he had in mind, one that did not require laserdisc technology. He instead pitched a semi-autobiographical game based on his teenage high school years, with the protagonist Kunio-kun loosely based on himself. Kishimoto recalled his experiences as a high school student regularly getting into fights on a daily basis, which was partly triggered by a break-up with a girl who dumped him. Kishimito was also a fan of Bruce Lee&#x27;s Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). He combined elements from Lee&#x27;s &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; with that of his own life to create the concept for &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;.

In contrast to earlier side-scrolling martial arts action games, most notably Irem&#x27;s &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; greatly increased the amount of health available to the player and the enemies. This allowed Kishimoto to create gameplay centered around the &quot;knock-down-drag-out&quot; fights, as seen in Bruce Lee films such as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; as well as the altercations Kishimoto had himself experienced in his youth. Rather than one-hit kills, his idea was that the player needed to hit enemies multiple times, &quot;beating them up&quot; in order to defeat them. Compared to earlier side-scrollers, the environment was expanded to a scrolling arena-like space, while the combat system was more highly developed.

The use of an isometric perspective, combined with separate buttons for punching and kicking, also meant that the player character could no longer press up to jump like in &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;. To compensate, an additional jump button was added instead, resulting in the standard three-button beat &#x27;em up control scheme.

==Localization and ports==

&quot;Renegade&quot; is a localization of the Japanese &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; for the North American and worldwide markets, with the game&#x27;s graphics changed in an attempt to adapt the game&#x27;s setting to a more western style (with what can be seen as thinly veiled &#x27;inspiration&#x27; from the film &quot;The Warriors&quot;). The gangs of thugs and bikers featured in &quot;Renegade&quot; were originally high school delinquents, &quot;bōsōzoku&quot; members, a &quot;sukeban&quot; along with her minions, and finally yakuza members in &quot;Kunio-kun&quot;. The subway level in the first stage was originally a Japanese train station, whereas most of the signs and billboards in the last two stages were also written in Japanese. The title of the Japanese version was influenced by Konami&#x27;s arcade game, &quot;Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun&quot; (known outside Japan as &quot;Mikie&quot;).

Instead of the damsel-in-distress plot of &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; instead featured the titular high school student, , standing up for his bullied friend Hiroshi. Each stage begins with the stage&#x27;s gang beating up Hiroshi in front of Nekketsu High School and Kunio chasing after his attackers. Unlike &quot;Renegade&quot;, Kunio and the game&#x27;s bosses are identified by name in-game, whereas the characters in &quot;Renegade&quot; are simply identified by the generic identifier &quot;1P&quot; or &quot;2P&quot; (depending on who is playing) and &quot;BOSS&quot; (it was not until the NES version that bosses in &quot;Renegade&quot; were given names). The bosses of &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; are: , , and . The game ends with Hiroshi and several students of Nekketsu High School greeting Kunio outside Sabu&#x27;s hideout, with Hiroshi giving Kunio a firm handshake. The game begins a new cycle, this time skipping the pre-stage introductions. Like &quot;Renegade&quot;, each character has a catch-phrase said by them in digitized voice, but spoken in Japanese.

The Family Computer version of &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; was Technos Japan&#x27;s first game for a home console. After &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;, Technos Japan reused the Kunio character for several more games, beginning with &quot;Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball Bu&quot; (the Japanese version of &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;) released for the arcades and the Famicom/NES. Some were released overseas, such as &quot;River City Ransom&quot; (the American version of &quot;Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari&quot;), &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot; (&quot;Nekketsu Kōkō Dodgeball Bu: Soccer Hen&quot;) and &quot;Crash &#x27;n the Boys: Street Challenge&quot; (&quot;Bikkuri Nekketsu Shin Kiroku!&quot;), but most of them were released only in Japan. Kunio eventually became Technos Japan&#x27;s official mascot, appearing on the company&#x27;s logos in the intros of some of their later games, as well as in their Japanese television advertisements.

==Ports==

The Nintendo Entertainment System version, developed in-house by Technos and released in 1987 by Taito in North America, is a strong departure from the original arcade game; the first three stages each consist of a series of two-screens wide levels against a group of three enemies at a time, culminating in a one-on-one fight with the boss. The second stage also contains a side-scrolling motorcycle chase, in which the player tries to kick opponents off their motorcycles, prior to the boss fight. In the third stage, the player can choose from one of two paths after clearing the first level of enemies: one leads to a confrontation against the stage boss, while the other is a second level filled with weaker enemies. The fourth and final stage is a maze of numerous rooms, filled with enemies and previous bosses, inside a building which the player must proceed in order to reach the final boss. There are trap doors in this stage which warp the player back to a previous stage, forcing the player to begin all over.

Home computer versions were released for the Amiga, Apple II and IBM PC in North America and for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST and Commodore 64 in Europe. The American computer ports were developed by Software Creations and published by Taito, whereas the European computer ports were published by Ocean Software on their Imagine label. An Apple IIGS port was developed and advertised by Taito Software in 1988, with actual screen-shots shown, but never released. The Commodore 64 version was programmed by Ocean&#x27;s Stephen Wahid. The home computer versions were typically limited to one fire button rather than three; the different moves are achieved by combining different joystick directions with a fire button press. The Amstrad CPC version mimicked the three-button control of the original by combining the joystick control with the cursor keys. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions use flip-screen rather than scrolling levels.

The Master System version, developed by Natsume and published by Sega in 1993, is based largely on the NES port rather than the original arcade, but with enhanced graphics and several improvements like new death cutscenes and a revamped ending. This port was only released in Europe, Australia and Brazil.

An arcade version of the game was ported to the PlayStation 4 in 2015 as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

==Reception==
In Japan, it was the top-grossing title on the &quot;Game Machine&quot; table arcade cabinet charts in July 1986, and became the fifth highest-grossing table arcade game during the latter half of 1986. In the United Kingdom, the ZX Spectrum version was the top-selling computer game on the monthly all-formats chart in September 1987. It also topped the ZX Spectrum charts from September to October 1987, and then it was number three the following month.

The game was voted by &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; readers as the second best game of 1987. In 1993, the Spectrum version was voted number 48 on the &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; &quot;Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; list.

David M. Wilson reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, saying that the arcade feel was carried over into the personal computer versions of &quot;Renegade&quot;, in which the players feel like martial arts fighters.

==Legacy==
The NES port of &quot;Renegade&quot; was released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in North America on May 5, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. It was re-released on February 27, 2014 both on the 3DS Virtual Console and Wii U Virtual Console.

A port for the Nintendo Switch was released in June 2018 by Hamster as part or their Arcade Archives series. This port includes both the US and Japanese versions of the original arcade edition, making it the first time the original Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun was released in the west commercially.

===Impact===
&quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; is considered the &quot;first fully-developed beat ’em up&quot; game, according to Andrew Williams. While elements of the genre were previously present in earlier side-scrolling martial arts action games, most notably &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot; introduced a number of key elements that more clearly defined the beat &#x27;em up genre and established the standard format adopted by later games in the genre.

The game set the standard for future beat &#x27;em up games as it introduced the ability to move both horizontally and vertically, in a scrolling arena-like space, commonly called the belt scroll action game format. Its combat system was also more highly developed than earlier side-scrolling action games, such as its introduction of combo attacks. &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; also introduced street brawling to the beat &#x27;em up genre, with the international version &quot;Renegade&quot; taking it further by adding an underworld revenge plot, proving more popular with gamers than the principled combat sports of earlier martial arts games.

===Sequels and related games===
&quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; spawned the separate &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; franchise. It was also the basis for Yoshihisa Kishimoto&#x27;s next game &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987), a spiritual successor that further advanced and popularized the beat &#x27;em up genre format established by &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot;, with &quot;Double Dragon&quot; itself originally intended to be a sequel before becoming a separate game.

Ocean Software produced two sequels to &quot;Renegade&quot;: &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Renegade III: The Final Chapter&quot;. These were released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and MSX, but never had corresponding arcade versions. &quot;Target: Renegade&quot; was also released on the NES.

Technos was slated to release the Game Boy title &quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun: Bangai Rantō Hen&quot; as a follow-up called &quot;The Renegades&quot;, but was eventually retooled as &quot;Double Dragon II&quot; and published by Acclaim.

Technos produced numerous games starring Kunio in Japan. Some of these were localized in North America as &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;, &quot;River City Ransom&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;. Technos had no involvement with the Ocean-produced &quot;Renegade&quot; sequels.

===Popular culture===
Manga artist Mizuki Kawashita has named one of the characters in her best known manga, &quot;Ichigo 100%&quot;, Misuzu Sotomura after the game character of the same first name.

<text>John Vivian Drummond Nettles, (born 11 October 1943) is an English actor and author. He is best known for his starring roles as detectives in the crime drama television series &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1981–1991) in the title role, and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; (1997–2011) as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby. He has also narrated several television series.

==Early life==
Nettles was born in St Austell in 1943. His birth mother was an Irish nurse who came to work in Great Britain during the Second World War. He was adopted at birth by carpenter Eric Nettles and his wife Elsie. 

As a youth he attended St Austell Grammar School. In 1962 he went to study history and philosophy at the University of Southampton, where he developed an interest in acting, and after graduation he joined the Royal Court Theatre.

==Acting career==
Nettles played Laertes to Tom Courtenay&#x27;s Hamlet in 1969 at the University Theatre for 69 Theatre Company in Manchester. From 1969 to 1970, he was in repertory at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter, and in the latter year had his first screen role in the film &quot;One More Time&quot;. The following year he played Dr. Ian Mackenzie in the period drama &quot;A Family at War&quot;, a role he continued until 1972. Following that he had small parts in many TV programmes including &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, &quot;Dickens of London&quot;, &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; and an episode of &quot;Enemy at the Door&quot; called &quot;Officers of the Law&quot;, first broadcast in March 1978. The latter was set in Guernsey during the German occupation of the Channel Islands in the Second World War and Nettles played a police detective ordered to work for the Germans, who is anguished over the conflict between his duty and collaborating with the enemy.

In 1981, Nettles became a household name in the UK when Robert Banks Stewart cast him as States of Jersey Police officer Jim Bergerac in the crime drama &quot;Bergerac&quot;. The series ran for 87 episodes on BBC1 until 1991. Following the end of &quot;Bergerac&quot;, Nettles did five seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;The Devil Is an Ass&quot;. In 1992 he appeared in an episode of &quot;Boon&quot;, and in 1993 reprised the role of Jim Bergerac in a guest appearance in the spoof police comedy &quot;The Detectives&quot;.

In 1995, Nettles was approached by Brian True-May to play Tom Barnaby in a new murder mystery series he was to produce called &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. This was to be the second major role of his television career, again playing a police detective. &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; was an immediate hit, achieving 13.5 million viewers on its launch in 1997 and was sold to more than 200 countries worldwide. In 2001 Nettles guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; playing fraudster Giles Sutton. In 2003 he played Barnaby in the Boxing Day episode of &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot;. In 2007 he appeared in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Will Smith Presents the Tao of Bergerac&quot;, alongside comedian Will Smith, which was about an obsessive fan of the series.

In February 2009, it was announced that Nettles had decided to leave &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; after two further series were made. His final appearance on-screen was on 2 February 2011, by which time he had appeared in 81 episodes. About his departure, he commented, &quot;It’s always wise to leave people wanting more, rather than be booed off the stage because you bored them.&quot;

In 2016 and 2017, Nettles had a recurring role as Ray Penvenen in the second and third series of the historical drama &quot;Poldark&quot;.

He later retired from acting, although would still provide voice work on television. He turned down the offer for a cameo appearance in the 2025 reboot of &quot;Bergerac&quot;&#x27;.

==Other television work==
In 1982, Nettles was Raoul (the 4th man) in the &quot;Agatha Christie Hour&quot; story &quot;The Fourth Man&quot;.

In the 1990s, Nettles narrated the BBC documentary &quot;X Cars&quot; following Greater Manchester Police&#x27;s stolen car squad during the height of the UK wide joyriding crime wave.

Nettles narrated &quot;Wild Discovery&quot; in 1995 and the BBC documentary series &quot;Airport&quot; from 1996 to 2005.

In early 2010, Nettles wrote, presented and produced a three-part documentary, &quot;Channel Islands at War&quot;, to mark the 70th anniversary of the German invasion and subsequent occupation of the Channel Islands. He received threatening letters from some residents of Jersey, accusing him of implying that islanders were collaborators. He defended the documentary saying: &quot;There is no possible way you could have avoided collaboration with the occupying power who had power over the civilian population. If you had not toed the line you would have been shot.&quot; This view was supported by local historians and members of the Channel Islands Occupation Society.

In 2020, Nettles took over as the narrator on the Channel 4 television show &quot;Devon and Cornwall&quot;, a sister show to the network&#x27;s &quot;The Yorkshire Dales and the Lakes&quot; programme. 

==Books==
During the filming of &quot;Bergerac&quot;, filmed on the island of Jersey, he wrote &quot;Bergerac&#x27;s Jersey&quot; (BBC Books, 1988; ), a travel guide to filming locations in the series. He followed up with &quot;John Nettles&#x27; Jersey: A Personal View of the People and Places&quot; (BBC Books, 1992; ) about the island&#x27;s landscape, personalities and history.

In 1991, he wrote the semi-autobiographical &quot;Nudity in a Public Place: Confessions of a Mini Celebrity&quot; (Robson Books; ) about becoming a &quot;reluctant heartthrob&quot; to female viewers of &quot;Bergerac&quot;. This was re-released as a Kindle version on Amazon in 2014 following the reruns of Bergerac on BBC2 as part of their afternoon nostalgia collection.

In 2012, Nettles wrote &quot;Jewels and Jackboots&quot; (Hardback ) about the German occupation of the Channel Islands. It sold out in a matter of weeks and was republished in 2013 as a paperback and on Kindle.

In 2019, John Nettles published an edition of the diaries of Reverend Douglas Ord during the German occupation of Guernsey during World War 2 (Hardback ). Nettles edited the diaries as well as writing an introduction.

==Personal life==
Nettles married his first wife, Joyce Middleton, in 1967. Their daughter, Emma Martins, was born in 1970, and moved to Jersey with her father for &quot;Bergerac&quot;. She joined the States of Jersey Police, working with officers who met her father during the show&#x27;s filming. After the Nettles&#x27;s divorce in 1979, Joyce became a casting director for &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;.

Nettles married his second wife, Cathryn Sealey, in July 1995 in Evesham, Worcestershire.

==Honours==
Nettles was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. 

==Awards==

1996 - University of Wolverhampton. Honorary Master of Art was awarded to John Nettles.

In 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton, from which he had graduated.

On 21 September 2012, Nettles was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Plymouth. He also agreed to be a patron of Devon charity The Mare and Foal Sanctuary in July 2014.

<text>Biffy Clyro are a Scottish rock band that formed in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, composed of Simon Neil (lead vocals, guitar) and twin brothers James (bass, backing vocals) and Ben Johnston (drums, backing vocals). Currently signed to 14th Floor Records, they have released nine studio albums, and following their first three albums, the band expanded their following significantly in 2007 with the release of their fourth album &quot;Puzzle&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was awarded a Platinum certification by the BPI. 

Their fifth album, &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; (2009) reached number three in the United Kingdom, and went Gold within days of its release before achieving double-platinum status in August 2011. The album also received a Mercury Music Prize nomination. &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; included the UK hit singles &quot;Mountains&quot;, &quot;That Golden Rule&quot;, and &quot;Many of Horror&quot;, all of which reached the UK Top Ten. The latter reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart after &quot;The X Factor&quot; 2010 winner, Matt Cardle covered the song, and became the UK number one Christmas single for the year 2010. In 2011, the band was nominated for the Brit Awards for Best British Group. At the 2013 NME Awards, they received the award for Best British Band. On 25 August 2013 Biffy Clyro headlined the main stage at Reading and Leeds Festival. Their sixth studio album, the double album &quot;Opposites&quot; was released in 2013, and was their first album to reach number one in the United Kingdom, and their second to reach number one in Scotland. 

It is estimated the band have sold in excess of 1,240,000 albums and 400,000 singles in the UK alone. As of 2021, in total, the band have spent 165 weeks in the top seventy-five of the UK Album Charts, with three of those weeks being at the top position at number one and 76 weeks within the main top forty of the albums charts. The band&#x27;s singles have spent a total of 79 weeks in the UK Singles Charts, with six weeks in the top ten and 42 in the top forty.

==History==
===1995–2000: Early years and formation===
The first incarnation of what would eventually become Biffy Clyro was formed in 1995, when fifteen-year-old Ayr-based guitarist Simon Neil started playing his songs with friend Kilmarnock-born Ben Johnston. Ben&#x27;s twin brother, James Johnston was soon brought in, and the three spent the next two years rehearsing, writing and covering songs. On 31 January 1995, they played their first gig under the name &quot;Skrewfish&quot; as the support for a band called Pink Kross at the Key Youth Centre in East Kilbride, now known as Universal Connections East Kilbride. In 1997, the trio moved to Glasgow, where Neil went to the University of Glasgow, and the Johnston twins went to Stow College, studying Electronics with Music and Audio Engineering, respectively.

After playing gigs around Glasgow and receiving positive and enthusiastic reactions from audiences, the band were spotted by Dee Bahl, who soon became their manager. Bahl offered them a chance to release an independent single on Aereogramme&#x27;s Babi Yaga record label: &quot;Iname&quot; was released on 28 June 1999, with Northsound Radio&#x27;s Jim Gellatly (later of Beat 106 &amp; Xfm Scotland) giving the band their first radio play. This first release led to the band being chosen by Stow College&#x27;s Electric Honey record label to release a record: &quot;thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow&quot; was released on Nerosa on 13 June 2000, receiving airplay from BBC Radio Scotland DJ Vic Galloway. A few days prior to the release of &quot;thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow&quot;, the band were spotted at the Unsigned Bands stage at T in the Park 2000 by a Beggars Banquet representative, and were signed to the independent Beggar&#x27;s Banquet soon thereafter.

===2001–2005: &quot;Blackened Sky&quot;, &quot;The Vertigo of Bliss&quot; and &quot;Infinity Land&quot;===

On 9 April 2001, the previously unreleased &quot;27&quot; was released as a single. On 1 October 2001, a song from &quot;thekidswho...&quot; was re-recorded and released as a single, &quot;Justboy&quot;; this was repeated again on 4 February 2002, when the song &quot;57&quot; was released. On 11 March, the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Blackened Sky&quot;, was released to generally positive reviews. It was around this time that the band began touring extensively, including supporting Weezer on 20 March at the Barrowlands in Glasgow. On 15 July, the fourth single from the album, &quot;Joy.Discovery.Invention&quot;, was released as a double A-side with a newly recorded song called &quot;Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys&quot; (which would later also appear on their next album &quot;The Vertigo of Bliss&quot;).

They toured as part of the Kerrang tour in 2001 alongside Sunna and Hell is For Heroes, followed by their first UK wide headline tour later on in the year.

In 2003, the band retreated to the Linford Manor recording studio in Great Linford, Milton Keynes, England, to record the follow-up to &quot;Blackened Sky&quot;. On 24 March, a new single was released called &quot;The Ideal Height&quot;, followed by a further new single &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; on 26 May. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Vertigo of Bliss&quot; was released on 16 June, to positive reviews which focused on the more experimental style of the album in comparison to &quot;Blackened Sky&quot;, as well as the introduction of string sections.

After touring relentlessly for &quot;The Vertigo of Bliss&quot;, the band retreated to Monnow Valley Studio in Monmouth, Wales to record a follow-up album. As with the previous album, two singles were released before the actual album: &quot;Glitter and Trauma&quot; and &quot;My Recovery Injection&quot; on 9 August and 20 September respectively. An additional digital download was also released on 31 May, called &quot;There&#x27;s No Such Thing as a Jaggy Snake&quot;. On 4 October, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Infinity Land&quot; was released, followed by the final single from the album, &quot;Only One Word Comes To Mind&quot;, on 14 February 2005. On 16 February, the band performed a cover of Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Out&quot; live from Maida Vale on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show.

Simon Neil&#x27;s side project Marmaduke Duke also released an album in 2005, known as &quot;The Magnificent Duke&quot;. He toured the UK together with the Johnston twins accompanying on bass and drums.

===2006–2008: &quot;Puzzle&quot; and mainstream success===


In 2006, Biffy Clyro left Beggars Banquet and signed a deal with 14th Floor, an offshoot of Warner Bros. In September, the band went to Canada to record their fourth album at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver (where it was engineered by Mike Fraser), and The Farm Studio in Gibsons. From these sessions the song &quot;Semi-Mental&quot; was released as a digital download on 25 December. On 5 March 2007 &quot;Saturday Superhouse&quot; was released, reaching No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Puzzle&quot; was released in June and helped the band to reach their highest UK Albums Chart position ever, hitting No. 2 in the first week of release, also reaching No. 17 in Ireland, and No. 39 in the overall world charts. The album is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 220,000 copies, and as of February 2009 has sold over 300,000 worldwide. This album is notable for having somewhat more straightforward song structures and a more melodic overall sound than their previous work, while still retaining some more unusual elements. &quot;Puzzle&quot; was voted the best album of 2007 by Kerrang! and Rock Sound. On 25 August, it was announced that &quot;Machines&quot; would be the next single from &quot;Puzzle&quot;, which was released on 8 October.

Support slots for acts such as Muse (at the new Wembley Stadium), The Who, Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Rolling Stones were significant in expanding Biffy&#x27;s fan base. The band also played the Download 2007, Glastonbury 2007, Reading and Leeds Festival and T in the Park for a record seventh time. The band opened for Linkin Park during January on their European tour. In 2008, the band toured with Queens Of The Stone Age on their European and North American tours for &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;, and opened for New Jersey rockers Bon Jovi at Twickenham during the Lost Highway Tour. In December 2008 the band played their biggest headline shows, including a date at Glasgow&#x27;s 10,000 capacity SECC.

===2008–2010: &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;===

The band released a new single entitled &quot;Mountains&quot; in July 2008, which reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart – the band&#x27;s first song to reach the top 10, and their highest charting single to date. &quot;Mountains&quot; would later be included on their new album. In an interview with the &quot;NME&quot;, the band stated that they had started work on a follow up to &quot;Puzzle&quot;, with Simon Neil saying that the album would include some of the band&#x27;s &quot;heaviest riffs to date&quot;. In an interview with XFM, Ben Johnston revealed that the forthcoming album would be &quot;Oli Coates&quot;, and that they already had 16 demos laid down. Simon Neil told Kerrang magazine about the new album on 8 December, playfully saying &quot;The soft bits are softer, and the hard bits are harder...&quot;, mocking how bands always label their new albums the most heavy and yet melodic so far. The band worked with &quot;Puzzle&quot; producer Garth Richardson once again at Ocean Way studios. Many videos were shown on the internet of them playing along to Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;. A &quot;Kerrang!&quot; article, published in March 2009, stated that they planned to enter the studio in April, revealing a working title for the upcoming album: &quot;Boom, Blast and Ruin&quot;. A series of weekly updates on their official site slowly revealed letters of the new album title, and, after &quot;Rock Sound&quot; mistakenly revealed the album&#x27;s name as &quot;Only Exceptions&quot;, it was officially announced that the album would be titled &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;.

In July 2009, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reported that they were filming the video for the first single from the album, &quot;That Golden Rule&quot;. It was filmed on 1 July in London, with the band saying that the song is &quot;like Kyuss and Tool playing with some Scottish freaks screaming over the top of it.&quot; &quot;That Golden Rule&quot; got its first play on Zane Lowe&#x27;s Radio 1 show on 8 July, playing the song twice in a row; it was then announced that the single would be released on 23 August 2009. It went on to reach No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Just before the official release of &quot;That Golden Rule&quot;, Biffy Clyro performed on the main stage at V Festival, their second appearance at the festival (the first time being in 2006, in a much earlier slot; during their set on the Chelmsford leg, the band experienced power failures twice during the opening song &quot;Glitter and Trauma&quot;). &quot;The Captain&quot; was released as a single on 26 October 2009, following its first radio play on Zane Lowe&#x27;s Radio 1 show on 8 September. &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; was released on 9 November 2009. On 24 February 2010, &quot;The Captain&quot; won an NME Award for Best Video.

Biffy Clyro were confirmed to be supporting Muse for 14 dates on their European tour, including Wembley Stadium on 11 September, performing after I Am Arrows and White Lies. Biffy Clyro performed on the Main Stage at the T in the Park, Oxegen and Reading and Leeds music festivals in 2010. The band were also slated to perform at New Zealand&#x27;s largest music festival Rhythm &amp; Vines at Waiohika Estate Vineyard in Gisborne on 29 December, but had to pull out due to &quot;minor medical procedures&quot; required by two band members.

===2011–2014: &quot;Opposites&quot;===

On 2 and 3 July 2011 Biffy Clyro supported Foo Fighters in front of 130,000 fans (65,000 each night) at the Milton Keynes Bowl (National Bowl) in the U.K. On Saturday 9 July 2011, Biffy Clyro headlined the main stage (Apollo Stage) at Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House. The following day, they headlined the main stage (West Stage) at Wakestock in Cardigan Bay, North Wales. Biffy Clyro opened for Metallica in Bangalore, India in 2011. 

The band revealed via the NME that they would release two studio albums in 2012, &quot;The Land at the End of Our Toes&quot;, and &quot;The Sand at the Core of Our Bones&quot;. From 17 May 2012, the band allowed fans to watch the recording process of &quot;The Land at the End of Our Toes&quot; and &quot;The Sand at the Core of Our Bones&quot; via a webcam link-up on their official website. The official Biffy Clyro website | biffyclyro.com The live feed has confirmed the involvement of frequent Biffy Clyro producer Garth Richardson, who also produced &quot;Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;. On 30 July 2012, the band announced on Twitter that a new track titled &quot;Stingin&#x27; Belle&quot; would be given its official premiere in the UK on Zane Lowe&#x27;s Radio 1 show the following evening, and that the music video for the song would be available from 9pm for 12 hours to members of the band&#x27;s official fan club. At 19:37 BST on Tuesday 31 July, Simon Neil confirmed on Zane Lowe&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1 that the new album title would be &quot;Opposites&quot; . Their new single titled Black Chandelier premièred on BBC Radio 1 on 19 November 2012. The band announced they would be playing a large arena tour through March/April 2013, including London&#x27;s The O2 Arena, with City and Colour in support. On Sunday 3 February 2013, &quot;Opposites&quot; topped the UK Albums Charts, giving Biffy Clyro their first number one album. The next day, it was announced on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe that they were the second headliner for Reading &amp; Leeds Festivals. Biffy Clyro also headlined the second day of the annual Radio 1 Big Weekend festival on 25 May 2013 in Derry, as well as the Cape Town and Johannesburg legs of RAMfest 2014.

Simon Neil was interviewed by NME on 6 January 2014, and announced a planned &quot;Opposites&quot; b-side compilation, entitled &quot;Similarities&quot;, for release later in the year. Being interviewed for the article, lead singer Simon Neil stated that the band had come up with &quot;six or seven&quot; riffs for new material, although he did point out that their next album would not be recorded until at least 2015. &quot;Similarities&quot; was later released on 18 July 2014.

===2016–2018: &quot;Ellipsis&quot;===


The band announced that 2015 would be their &#x27;year off.&#x27; In an interview with 3FM in June 2014, Neil stated that &quot;[the band] will take a quiet year next year and disappear so people don&#x27;t get sick of the lovely Biffy.&quot; In the same interview he stated that they were working on about 19 new songs, but felt it was too early to play them live. He confirmed that a new album was coming, most likely towards the end of 2015. The first single &quot;Wolves of Winter&quot; was exclusively played as Hottest Record on Monday 21 March 2016 on Radio 1. On Monday 21 March 2016, during the live premiere of &quot;Wolves of Winter&quot; on Hottest Record on Beats 1, Zane Lowe, Neil announced that the band&#x27;s new album would be titled &quot;Ellipsis&quot;. The album, due for release on 8 July 2016, was made available to pre-order in a limited edition box set on the Biffy Clyro web store.

&quot;Ellipsis&quot; was released on 8 July 2016, entering the UK charts at No. 1. Following the successful launch of &quot;Ellipsis&quot;, the band performed co-headline slots (co-headlining with Fall Out Boy) at the Reading &amp; Leeds festival. The new &quot;Ellipsis&quot; songs featured prominently in the setlist. Between the two headline slots, Biffy Clyro also performed a huge outdoor show in Glasgow, with Fall Out Boy filling in as the support act. In November 2016, Biffy Clyro were announced as the Saturday headliners of the Download Festival 2017. This marked their sixth appearance at the festival and their first headline performance on the main stage.

To coincide with these headline performances, a U.K. arena tour was announced with Brand New announced as the support act. The tour culminated in a performance at London&#x27;s O2 arena, in December 2016.
In February 2017, Biffy Clyro performed at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire as part of Brit&#x27;s Week to raise money for charity War Child. To celebrate such an intimate performance at this point in their career, the band performed as their own support act with Simon Neil announcing &quot;we are Biffy Clyro, circa 2003 to 2005&quot;, and they played an hour long set of material from their first three albums. On 27 May 2017, Biffy Clyro performed to 25,000 people at the Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend Hull 2017. The band also performed at Glastonbury on Sunday 25 June 2017. Autumn of 2018 saw the release of the &quot;MTV Unplugged: Live at Roundhouse, London&quot; show on DVD and album. A European tour of the show soon followed plus a few other pieces that translated well acoustically.

===2018–2019: &quot;Balance, Not Symmetry&quot;===
In April 2018, Biffy Clyro announced that they were concurrently working on two albums, their eighth studio album with the working title &quot;Opus 8&quot; (released in 2020 as &quot;A Celebration of Endings&quot;) as well as a soundtrack album. For the soundtrack album, they were working with Welsh director Jamie Adams producing a movie to go along with new, original music. The film, called &quot;Balance, Not Symmetry&quot; debuted at the Edinburgh Film Festival on 23 June 2019. The 17-song soundtrack album, also named &quot;Balance, Not Symmetry&quot; was released digitally on 17 May 2019 with a vinyl pre-order made available for release on 26 July. The film stars Laura Harrier, Bria Vinaite, Tasmin Egerton, Freya Mavor, Kate Dickie, Scott Miller, and Lily Newmark.

===2020–2022: &quot;A Celebration of Endings&quot; and &quot;The Myth of the Happily Ever After&quot;===

On 20 February 2020, Biffy Clyro released the single &quot;Instant History&quot;. The track was taken from their eighth studio album &quot;A Celebration of Endings&quot;. The second single &quot;End Of&quot; was released on 5 March alongside the announcement of the album&#x27;s title and the release date of 15 May, although this date had to be postponed to 14 August, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The third single from the album &quot;Tiny Indoor Fireworks&quot; was released on 14 May. &quot;A Celebration Of Endings&quot; entered at No.1 on the UK Albums Chart, making it the band&#x27;s third consecutive No.1 album.

The band had initially announced a UK, Europe and Australia arena tour, beginning in September 2020, although this was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, the band played a livestream concert from the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow, playing all the songs from their new album. They also announced a series of tour dates in smaller venues in April 2021, titled the &quot;Fingers Crossed Tour,&quot; though this was also postponed to October-November 2021. 

The band contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021. On 3 September 2021, they released the single &quot;Unknown Male 01&quot;, alongside the announcement of another album titled &quot;The Myth of the Happily Ever After&quot;, which was released on 22 October 2021.

In February 2022, Amazon Prime Video released an hour-long documentary about Biffy Clyro and the making of &quot;The Myth of the Happily Ever After&quot;, titled &quot;Cultural Sons of Scotland&quot;.

== Artistry ==

=== Name ===
The band have never disclosed where the name &quot;Biffy Clyro&quot; originated, and Simon Neil has said that it was &quot;a stupid name&quot; that was often &quot;awkward&quot; to explain its origins when the band started and when not many had heard their music. Whilst being interviewed on Soccer AM, the band said that they make up stories about how they are named because they are bored with being asked the same question. Among the conflicting answers the band have given are:

*In a Soccer AM interview, the band stated that they named themselves after a footballer named Biffy Clyro who played for South Ayrshire football club Ayr United.
*Another story is that the band members were thinking about manufacturing Cliff Richard merchandise and they thought about the Laszlo Biro pen and thought of &quot;Cliffy Biro&quot; that was then accidentally spoonerised on a drunken night out to &#x27;Biffy Clyro&#x27;.
*Another interview claims that the name Biffy Clyro comes from an acronym for &quot;Big Imagination For Feeling Young &#x27;Cos Life Yearns Real Optimism&quot;.
*The band stated in an interview for BalconyTV that the name was that of a Finnish footballer from the 17th century.
*On Off the Ball in August 2011, Ben Johnston said &quot;Well it&#x27;s a marriage of two words: Biffy is in fact the nickname of the spy who the James Bond novels were based on and Clyro is a village in Wales where both our families … used to go on holiday …&quot;.
*In an episode of Music Choice&#x27;s &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, Simon Neil said that Biffy Clyro is the name of a Scotsman that built his own rocket and was the first man in space.

===Influences===
According to Ben Johnston, the band has drawn from a wide range of acts:&quot;I guess we were all locked to Nirvana and that whole Seattle sound thing. That really woke us up to what was possible in terms of how simplistic you could be but still have power. How you didn’t have to be a virtuoso. We liked Guns N&#x27; Roses and stuff before that and then when Nirvana hit us at 14 or 15, everything changed. We started to think we could be a band possibly. Soundgarden, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and then some more obscure American bands like Karate and Braid, and proggy stuff like Rush, Yes, and Dillinger Escape Plan. Then we get into more softer things like Red House Painters and more folky stuff. But we always wanted to be somewhere in the middle of that. I could play you parts of our songs that sound like Dillinger and some that sound like Red House Painters… the most un-pigeonhole-able band in the world.&quot;Additionally, the band has cited Weezer and the Afghan Whigs as influences.

Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s second novel &quot;Only Revolutions&quot; was influential for the album &quot;Only Revolutions&quot;; the band have since met Danielewski, discovering that he was a fan when he attended one of their shows.

<text>The Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) is a reserve infantry regiment in the 34 Canadian Brigade Group, 2nd Canadian Division, of the Canadian Army. The regiment is the oldest and second-most-senior infantry regiment in the Primary Reserve of the Canadian Army. Located in Montreal, its main role is the provision of combat-ready light infantry troops in support of Canadian regular infantry. It is a Household Foot Guard regiment and also provides soldiers for public ceremonial duties (Ceremonial Guard), performing similar ceremonial duties as the Guards regiments of the British Army. This primarily entails mounting the guard at Government House (Rideau Hall), the King&#x27;s and Governor General&#x27;s residence, and performing the &quot;Changing the Guard&quot; ceremony on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, a task it shares with Canada&#x27;s senior Household Foot Guard regiment, the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards of Ottawa. The Canadian Grenadier Guards is an allied regiment to the British Grenadier Guards.

== Lineage ==
=== The Canadian Grenadier Guards ===
&quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; originated in Montreal, Quebec on 17 November 1859 as the &quot;First Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada&quot;. It was redesignated as &quot;The First (or Prince of Wales&#x27;s) Regiment of Volunteer Rifles of Canadian Militia&quot; on 7 September 1860. On 2 May 1898 it amalgamated with the &quot;6th Battalion &quot;Fusiliers&quot;&quot; and was redesignated the &quot;1st Battalion &quot;Prince of Wales&#x27; Regiment Fusiliers&quot;&quot;. It was redesignated as the &quot;1st Regiment &quot;Prince of Wales&#x27; Fusiliers&quot;&quot; on 8 May 1900; as the &quot;1st Regiment Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; on 29 December 1911; as &quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; on 29 March 1920; as the &quot;2nd (Reserve) Battalion, The Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; on 7 November 1941; as &quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; on 15 February 1946; as &quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards (6th Battalion, The Canadian Guards)&quot; on 1 September 1954 before reverting to &quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot; on 1 August 1976.

==Operational history==

===The Fenian Raids===
&quot;The First (or Prince of Wales&#x27;s) Regiment of Volunteer Rifles of Canadian Militia&quot; was called out on active service on 8 March 1866 and served on the South-eastern frontier until it was removed from active service on 31 March 1866.

&quot;The Sixth Battalion Volunteer Militia, Canada&quot; was called out on active service from 8 to 31 March and from 1 to 22 June 1866 and served on the South-eastern frontier.

&quot;The First (or Prince of Wales&#x27;s) Regiment of Volunteer Rifles of Canadian Militia&quot; was called out on active service on 24 May 1870 and served on the South-eastern frontier until it was removed from active service on 31 May 1870.

&quot;The Sixth Battalion Volunteer Militia, Canada&quot; was called out on active service on 24 May 1870 and served on the South-eastern frontier until it was removed from active service on 31 May 1870.

The regiment contributed volunteers for the Canadian Contingents during the Second Boer War (1899–1902).

===The Second Boer War (11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902)===

At total of 23 members of &quot;1st Prince of Wales Fusiliers (1st P.W.R.F.)&quot; participated and served during the Second Boer War, most (16) being attached to &#x27;E&#x27; Company of The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry, 2nd (Special Service) Battalion. Several Officers (3) relinquished their commissions to join Canadian Mounted units with The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse, and The Canadian Scouts. A further 4 Officers joined British or South African Mounted units.

On 12 February 1900, the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry, 2nd (Special Service) Battalion joined the 19th Brigade to march and fight in the great British offensive aimed at capturing Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal. The battalion was soon in action at Paardeberg Drift, suffering heavy casualties on 18 February, and mounting the famous attack that led to the surrender of General Cronje&#x27;s Boer forces on the 27th. Paardeberg was the first major British victory of the war.

After the Battle of Paardeberg the 2nd Battalion RCRI fought in the British advance on the Boer capitals of Bloemfontein and Pretoria, gaining in experience and reputation all the while. By the time they marched past Lord Roberts in Pretoria on 5 June 1900, it was considered by many observers as good as any battalion in the British Army. With the Transvaal capital in British hands, and the war seemingly won, the 2nd Battalion took up lines-of-communications duties and the unit spent the rest of its tour of operations on this assignment, except for an interlude spent with a column of infantry chasing mounted Boer forces.

===The Great War===
Details of the regiment were placed on active service on 6 August 1914 for local protection duties. Following conventional army practice the whole regiment was not sent. Some 350 men were drafted to join the 14th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). While other contingents were also recruited for France and Flanders: the &quot;87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF&quot; was authorised on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 23 April 1916. It disembarked in France on 12 August 1916, where it fought as part of the &quot;11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Division&quot; in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 30 August 1920. The system of temporary battalion formations was quite disruptive for the regulars of the permanent regimental establishment.

The &quot;245th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), CEF&quot; was authorised on 15 July 1916 and embarked for Britain on 3 May 1917 where it was absorbed by the &quot;23rd Reserve Battalion, CEF&quot; on 14 May 1917 to provide reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 17 July 1917.

===The Second World War===
The recruitment drive in 1939 was entirely different from that deployed during the Great War. The regiment mobilised &quot;The Canadian Grenadier Guards, CASF&quot; on 24 May 1940. It was re-designated as the &quot;1st Battalion, The Canadian Grenadier Guards, CASF&quot; on 7 November 1940. It was converted to armour and re-designated as the &quot;22nd Armoured Regiment (The Canadian Grenadier Guards), CAC, CASF&quot; on 26 January 1942. It embarked for Britain on 25 September 1942. Less than two years later, in June 1944, it sailed with the D-Day landings. On 26 July 1944, it landed in France as part of the &quot;4th Armoured Brigade, 4th Canadian Armoured Division&quot;, and continued to fight in North West Europe until the end of the war. The regimental casualties were 97 killed, and 230 wounded. It was reconfigured as the &quot;22nd Armoured Regiment (The Canadian Grenadier Guards), RCAC, CASF&quot; on 2 August 1945. The overseas regiment was disbanded on 15 February 1946. Their uniform was similar to that of the British Grenadiers except for the regimental buttons and a red and white hackle.

On 1 June 1945, a second Active Force component of the regiment was mobilised for service in the Pacific theatre of operations as the &quot;22nd Canadian Tank Battalion (The Canadian Grenadier Guards), CAC, CASF&quot;. It was re-designated the &quot;22nd Canadian Tank Battalion (The Canadian Grenadier Guards), RCAC, CASF&quot; and was disbanded on 1 November 1945.

===War in Afghanistan===
The regiment contributed a large number of volunteers for the Canadian task forces contingents during the War in Afghanistan.

==History==
===Predecessor and perpetuated units===
The history of the Canadian Grenadier Guards parallels in many ways the evolution of Canada as a nation, beginning in the early days after the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

On 12 March 1764, Colonel Frederick Haldimand ordered, from Trois-Rivières, Quebec, the formation of a volunteer unit to aid in the defence of Canada. In response, the &quot;1st Company, District of Montreal Militia&quot; was raised, under the command of Captain de Montizambert; the company was drawn from the traditional Militia of the Ancien Régime, and was predominantly French-speaking. This company was raised in status to a battalion in 1807, becoming the &quot;1st Battalion, Montreal Militia&quot; under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel James McGill, founder of McGill University. Elements of the 1st Battalion fought at the Battle of Châteauguay (26 October 1813) under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry; as a result of their conduct, the 1st Battalion was awarded a pair of Colours after recommendation by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir George Prevost, to the Prince Regent.

The Select Embodied Militia continued to exist after the War of 1812, being called upon next during the Rebellions of 1837–1838. Various units existed as Montreal Rifles, Loyal Montreal Volunteers and later Montreal Volunteer Rifles. With the passage of the Militia Act in 1859, the Montreal Rifles (and other independent companies) became the &quot;First Battalion, Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada&quot; on 17 November 1859, the first &quot;Volunteer Militia&quot; battalion to be formed in the British Empire. In 1860, the unit was raised to regimental status by The Prince of Wales with the title of &quot;First or &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; Regiment, Volunteer Rifles of the Canadian Militia&quot;; its regimental status was unique within the Canadian Militia, highlighted by the Regimental motto &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot; and its designation as the First Regiment. The Prince of Wales became the Honorary Colonel, an appointment he continued to hold after his coronation as King Edward VII in 1902.

In addition to those directly antecedent to the First Regiment, the 6th Battalion, Volunteer Militia, was raised in 1862, which later became the 6th Battalion Hochelaga Light Infantry and subsequently the 6th Battalion Fusiliers. In 1898, this Battalion disbanded and absorbed into the First Regiment to become the &quot;1st Battalion Prince of Wales Regiment Fusiliers&quot;, which then became the &quot;1st Regiment, Prince of Wales&#x27; Fusiliers&quot; in 1900. Lieutenant-Colonel J.H. Burland, last Commanding Officer of the Sixth Fusiliers, became the first Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel in 1904.

During the period from 1859 to 1900, both the regiment and the Sixth Fusiliers were on active service during the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870, and the First Regiment was next for duty in Montreal at the time of the North-West Rebellion in 1885, being encamped under arms for a month ready to go to the front. When the first South African contingent was formed as the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, the First Regiment contributed its quota of officers and men to &quot;E&quot; Company. This contribution earned the battle honour &quot;South Africa 1899–1900&quot;.

===Early 20th century and First World War===
In 1911, Lieutenant-Colonel J.W. Carson (later Major-General Sir William Carson) was asked to reorganise the regiment, he agreed on the conditions that he be given a free hand in the selection of his officers; that the regiment should be renamed and become a Regiment of Foot Guards while still preserving its identity as the First Regiment of the Active Militia of Canada; and that it should be provided with an armoury of its own. The reorganisation was promulgated in January 1912, when the First Regiment became &quot;1st Regiment, The Grenadier Guards of Canada&quot;, and in April 1914 took possession of the new armoury and changed its name again to &quot;1st Regiment Canadian Grenadier Guards&quot;. It remained the First Regiment (although junior as a regiment of Foot Guards to the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards, raised in 1872 as Household Troops for the Governor-General), and was seen to be the Canadian unit of Household Troops for the Sovereign.

Within a week of the declaration of the Great War, the regiment contributed the first Commanding Officer, 11 officers and 357 Non-commissioned Officers and men to the newly formed &quot;The Royal Montreal Regiment&quot; (14th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force). Further contingents were provided to Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), the 23rd Battalion (Royal Montreal Regiment), 24th Battalion (Victoria Rifles of Canada), 60th Battalion (VRC), and the 73rd Battalion (RHC) all of the CEF.

Lieutenant-Colonel Frank Stephen Meighen returned from overseas command of the 14th Battalion in June 1915 and announced in September that permission finally had been given to raise an overseas battalion of the regiment, the 87th Battalion CEF. Active recruiting began on 23 October, and in seven weeks the battalion was raised and ready for its winter training in barracks at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. The battalion was unique in that recruiting had occurred not only in Montreal but in every province of Canada (rather than the restricted area allocated to other CEF Battalions) – it was a thoroughly representative &quot;Canadian&quot; unit.

Use of the title Canadian Grenadier Guards was also different, as the policy had been to not send CEF battalions overseas with their Militia titles; for the Canadian Grenadiers, especial authority was sought from The Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught who as a British Grenadier authorised additionally the wearing of Grenadier Guards&#x27; badges.

The 87th Battalion entered France on 12 August 1916 and remained on the continent until 1919. During the War, it earned 17 Honorary Distinctions, and Private John Francis Young was awarded the Victoria Cross.

After the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917, the increasing difficulty of finding replacements for the English-speaking battalions from Montreal became acute. Earlier, in the spring of 1916, the regiment had raised a second CEF battalion in Montreal, the 245th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), which was placed under the command of Lieut-Col. C. C. Ballantyne when it left for England. After sailing to England in May 1917, the battalion was absorbed into the 23rd Reserve Battalion, CEF upon arrival, its personnel being used to supplement the 87th Bn and the 1st (Central Ontario) Bn of the CEF. Consequently, and to retain the Canadian Grenadiers amongst the active units of the army, the decision was made to transfer the remaining personnel of the 60th Bn (VRC) to the 87th Bn. On 22 November 1918, King George V granted the title of &quot;Guardsman&quot; to Private soldiers of the Brigade of Guards, and this distinction extended to the Canadian Grenadiers.

===Between the wars===
On return to Canada in 1919, the 87th Bn was demobilised; its name was perpetuated by the 1st Battalion, The Canadian Grenadier Guards (87th Bn CEF) in 1920. At the same time the 2nd Battalion, Canadian Grenadier Guards (245th Bn CEF) perpetuated the other Great War Battalion of the CEF. With this reorganisation, the regiment lost the ordinal title of &quot;First Regiment&quot;, as numerals for all regiments were discarded.

The return to peace permitted steps to be taken to enhance the status of the regiment as a Regiment of Foot Guards. In 1924, The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) became the Colonel-in-Chief, and was able to inspect the regiment during a visit to Canada in 1927. In 1930, King George V approved the alliance with the Grenadier Guards, which linkage continues today. In 1932, he approved the use of a Stand of Foot Guard Colours (presented in 1935), and of Company Colours within the regiment. In 1937, the Brigade of Canadian Guards was authorised (comprising the GGFG and the CGG), which brigade trooped in Ottawa on a number of occasions, not least for King George VI during the Royal Visit in 1939; the brigade was inspected in England in November 1942 by Major-General Phelan (late of the CGG) who had commanded it in Ottawa in 1935.

In addition to the continuing linkage with McGill University, a strong linkage grew with the St. George&#x27;s Society of Montreal. One of the benevolent Societies, St. George&#x27;s supported the regiment in a number of ways; in return, the regiment paraded to the Regimental Church (Christ Church Cathedral) on the Sunday closest to St. George&#x27;s Day at the end of which service the regiment paraded past the President of the Society (often at the gates of McGill University) and then received the Society &quot;At Home&quot;. This linkage continued well into the 1960s, and members of the Society are still welcome in the armoury.

===Second World War===

At the outbreak of the Second World War, the regiment furnished 20 officers and 125 other ranks to other units before its own mobilisation in 1940 when, as 1st Battalion, the Canadian Grenadier Guards, it reached full strength in three weeks. It trained first on St. Helen&#x27;s Island in Montreal, moved subsequently to Camps Borden and Valcartier, garrisoned the Halifax citadel, was stationed in Saint John, New Brunswick, and trained in Sussex, New Brunswick and Debert, Nova Scotia.

On 5 February 1942, the First Battalion became 22nd Canadian Armoured Regiment (CGG), a unit of 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division (which included 21st Canadian Armoured Regiment (GGFG)). In September, proudly wearing the black beret of the Armoured Corps, 22 CAR moved to England where it would continue to train in a number of areas until deployed to Normandy on 21 July 1944. From that time until VE Day on 8 May 1945, 22 CAR fought throughout the battles around Falaise, the move into Belgium and the Netherlands and finally across the Rhine, earning 12 Honorary Distinctions. By this time, 22nd Canadian Tank Battalion (CGG) had been raised for the Pacific Force, but the war in the Pacific ended before it could be deployed overseas. 22nd Canadian Armoured Regiment returned to Montreal in February 1946 for demobilization and gave up its tanks.

The regiment&#x27;s participation in the Second World War also saw numerous heroic actions by Sergeant Moe Hurwitz, who did not survive the war.

===Post-Second World War===
On formation of the 1st Battalion, the home station battalion became 2nd Battalion, the Canadian Grenadier Guards, which continued through the war the traditional role of the Militia to provide reinforcements to units overseas. Reinforcements were drawn from other units, particularly the Halifax Rifles and Princess Louise Fusiliers.

On reorganization, the CGG resumed its traditional Militia role as a regiment of foot guards many of those who had served overseas continued to serve the regiment in Montreal. The peacetime routine of training, garrison duties and parades was highlighted by the appointment of King George VI as Colonel-in-Chief, the acceptance of the honorary colonelcy by Field Marshal The Viscount Alexander of Tunis (himself a guardsman), the opening by him of the Regimental Museum as a memorial to the dead in 1950 and the participation by members of the regiment in Korea. With the formation of the Canadian Guards (a regular unit of four battalions) in 1953, the regiment became the 6th Battalion, under which title it received a new stand of colours from Queen Elizabeth II, the Colonel-in-Chief, in 1959 (the first occasion where a Militia unit received a stand of colours in Canada from the hand of a reigning sovereign). Five years earlier the Queen had granted permission for four battalions to be raised.

Although the responsibility for public duties in Ottawa was assumed by the Canadian Guards, the regiment provided individuals for this purpose until the formation of the Ceremonial Guard in 1969. Since that date, No. 2 (CGG) Company has participated in the Changing of the Guard on Parliament Hill and Rideau Hall during the summer months. As a result, the City of Ottawa granted its Freedom to the regiment in 1979; a similar grant was made by Montreal in 1990 in commemoration of 225 years of service to the city since the formation of 1st Company, District of Montreal Militia, in 1764.

Service to Canada and Montreal continues. Members of the regiment participated in aid to civil power at Oka and Kahnawake in the summer of 1990, and members served with the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia, as well as with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Middle East. Members served with and in support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan; the Canadian name for that mission was Operation Athena. Most recently, members deployed in various capacities and roles on Operation Reassurance, Operation Unifier, Operation Impact. As well as supporting domestic operations on Operation Lentus and Operation Laser.

* An M4 tank at Connaught Ranges and Primary Training Centre in Ottawa was dedicated by the 22nd Armoured Regiment (The Canadian Grenadier Guards) to the memory of its soldiers who fought in Northwest Europe from 1944 to 1945.
* Coudehard-Montormel Memorial – In 1965 on the battle&#x27;s 20th anniversary, a monument to the Polish, Canadian (22nd Armoured Regiment (The Canadian Grenadier Guards)), American and French units that took part in the battle was erected on Hill 262. Marking the occasion, former President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower commented that &quot;no other battlefield presented such a horrible sight of death, hell, and total destruction.&quot; The Mémorial de Coudehard–Montormel museum was constructed on the same site on the battle&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1994.
* Place Léo Gariépy, Courseulles-sur-Mer – Sergeant Gariépy, a former Canadian Grenadier Guard, (1936–1940), was one of the Canadians who landed on Juno Beach on D-Day. At the end of the 1960s, Gariépy led the initiative to fish out of the water a DD tank named &quot;Bold&quot;, which had sunk off Courseulles on D-Day. The tank was raised, restored, and offered to the town. It is displayed in Place Léo Gariépy, visible from the Juno Beach Centre. Gariépy died on 8 May 1972. He was an &quot;honorary citizen&quot; of Courseulles-sur-Mer and is buried in the military section of Courseulles&#x27; municipal cemetery.

<text>Ernesto Samper Pizano (born 3 August 1950) is a Colombian politician. Samper is a member of the influential Samper family. He served as the President of Colombia from 1994 to 1998, representing the Liberal Party. From 2014 to 2017 he served as the Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).

He was involved in the 8000 process scandal, which takes its name from the folio number assigned to it by the chief prosecutor&#x27;s office. The prosecutor charged that money from the Cali Cartel was funneled into Samper&#x27;s presidential campaign to gain his success in what would have been a very close race after he failed to win by a majority during the first round (Colombia has 2 rounds of elections, unless the first round yields a majority winner). The Colombian Chamber of Representatives acquitted Samper by a vote of 111 to 43, concluding the process.

==Genealogy==
Samper is related to several other Colombians of note.

One of his great great grandfathers, Teodoro Valenzuela Sarmiento, was the nephew of the former president and hero of the Independence of Colombia, . Another of his great great grandfathers was the poet , and his great great grandmother Felisa Pombo Rebolledo was the sister of the poet Rafael Pombo.

Samper is a collateral descendant of Antonio Nariño&#x27;s, paternal grandson of writer , grandson in direct line of businessman Tomas Samper Brush, and grandson of the politician Miguel Samper Agudelo, who was a presidential candidate in 1898.

Samper is the nephew of the renowned architect , brother of writer, journalist and columnist Daniel Samper Pizano (as noted above), cousin of Patricio Samper Gnecco, and uncle of the former director of &quot;SoHo Magazine&quot;, Daniel Samper Ospina.

==Early life and education==
Ernesto was born on 3 August 1950 in Bogotá, to Andrés Samper Gnecco and Helena Pizano Pardo. Among his siblings, Daniel Samper Pizano stands out as a prolific writer and journalist, a trait not alien to the Samper family, who come from a long line of writers.

Samper studied in the Gimnasio Moderno, a prestigious secondary school in Bogotá, and attended the Pontifical Xavierian University, graduating in 1972 with a degree in economics. He obtained a degree in law in 1973. Additionally, he conducted graduate studies in Economics at Columbia University while living in New York City. In 1974, he became a professor of law and economics at his alma mater, the Pontifical Xavierian University.

==Early political career==
Samper helped manage the unsuccessful 1982 presidential campaign of former president Alfonso López Michelsen. He became a member of the Bogotá City Council. He was then a member of the Senate of Colombia.

==1990 presidential campaign==
Samper unsuccessfully ran for the Liberal Party&#x27;s nomination for president in 1990. Like the eventual winner, César Gaviria, Samper was from the reformist wing of the party. In 1989, Samper was wounded by 11 bullets during the assassination of Patriotic Union leader José Antequera, leaving Samper hospitalized with near-fatal sepsis. His subsequent campaign was conducted with strict regard for security, including wearing bullet-proof vests and being accompanied by a security detail of over 400.

==Minister and ambassador==
During the Gaviria administration, Samper served as Minister of Economic Development, (1990–1991) and as ambassador to Spain (1991–1993).

==1994 presidential campaign==
In 1993, when the 1994 presidential campaign was in its early stages, it became increasingly clear that the race was going to be close, particularly between Samper and Andrés Pastrana, the candidate of the Colombian Conservative Party: opinion polls were sharply divided. Presidential elections took place on 29 May 1994. Ernesto Samper won the first electoral round—where about 1/2 of 17 million voters cast ballots—with 45.2% of the vote. Pastrana was the runner up, with 45%. 16 other candidates divided the remainder. Colombian electoral law states that if no candidate wins more than 50% + 1 vote in the first round, a second round between the two candidates who achieved the highest number of votes in the first round shall take place to identify a winner.

The results of the first round caused the Samper campaign team to secure additional funding to help widen the margin over the opposing candidate. The campaign had assumed that Ernesto Samper would win the election easily in the first round and had spent all of their campaign funds to achieve this. With the campaign financials running in the red, the campaign managers were faced with the need to rally support for an additional three weeks against a strong, well-funded opponent. In what can be described as an attempt to win at all cost, the campaign turned to the Cali Cartel, receiving cash donations in excess of $6 million US dollars. These donations were delivered in large colourful paper bags normally used for birthday gifts.

On 19 June 1994, after three weeks of arduous campaigning, Samper was elected president in the second-round voting, once again by a narrow margin, 50.37% to 48.64%, over Pastrana, being sworn in in August.

==Campaign scandal==
Shortly after his presidential victory, Samper was accused by Pastrana of having received campaign donations from the Cali Cartel of $3.75 million US dollars, with journalist Alberto Giraldo Lopez as the intermediary. Samper initially denied the allegations. Soon afterwards, a series of damaging tape recordings were released to the public. In 2021, Joe Toft of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration claimed ownership of the recordings.

Gustavo de Greiff, Colombia&#x27;s outgoing Chief Prosecutor cleared Samper of wrongdoing, after what critics termed a &quot;less-than-exhaustive&quot; investigation. His successor, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, personally led a new investigation. Valdivieso was a cousin of the late Luis Carlos Galán, a charismatic Liberal party presidential candidate assassinated in 1989 by the Medellín Cartel for his political views, particularly for favoring the extradition of drug lords to the United States. Valdivieso discovered connections between the Cali drug cartel and top figures of Colombia&#x27;s society, including the Colombian comptroller general, the president of the lower house of the Colombian congress, and nine congressman, as well as journalist Alberto Giraldo, who openly admitted to having ties to the Cali cartel. Although Samper&#x27;s campaign treasurer, Santiago Medina, came under investigation, Valdivieso refused to re-open the &quot;narco-cassette case&quot; that had been closed by de Greiff.

As a result of the investigation, Santiago Medina, the campaign&#x27;s treasurer, was arrested for accepting $50,000 from a company known to be a front for the Cali cartel. Just after Medina&#x27;s arrest, Samper gave a unscheduled, nationally televised address where he admitted the possibility that drug money had gone to his campaign. On 31 July 1995, days after Medina&#x27;s arrest, Fernando Botero, who had been Samper&#x27;s campaign manager, and Horacio Serpa, another political ally, held a press conference to deny Medina&#x27;s allegations, armed with copies of Medina&#x27;s testimony to the chief prosecutor. Serpa said the testimony had come from &quot;anonymous sources&quot;, but they were allegedly stolen from the prosecutor&#x27;s office. Valdivieso appeared on national television to angrily denounce Botero and Serpa for divulging such testimony. Medina was later convicted, and sentenced to prison.

On 2 August 1995, Botero resigned as defense minister, soon after Valdivieso asked the Colombian supreme court to investigate his role, and that of communications minister Armando Benedetti, in Samper&#x27;s campaign financing. On 15 August, Botero was arrested in connection with the investigation. Other political figures, such as Alberto Santofimio Botero and Eduardo Mestre, as well as journalist Alberto Giraldo, were also imprisoned as a result of the same investigation. The prosecutor also charged Samper, who insisted on his innocence. Samper said that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign, it had done so &quot;behind his back&quot;. Subsequently, Samper declared a 90-day state of emergency, which caused some to fear a shift to the right by Samper. The defection to the United States of cartel accountant Guillermo Pallomari put a trove of documents in the hands of investigators.

Cardinal Pedro Rubiano, a leader of Colombia&#x27;s Catholic Church, stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing an elephant entering one&#x27;s living room. Since then, the events that led to drug money financing the &quot;Samper for President&quot; campaign have been referred to as &quot;The Elephant&quot;.

According to the Colombian Constitution, only Congress can judge the president. So, once the Prosecutor General presented the case and delivered the evidence to the Congress, it was in the hands of the latter to evaluate the evidence and determine whether Samper was directly involved in this scandal. On 26 September 1995, Samper was questioned for nine hours by Heine Mogollón, the head of the Chamber of Representatives&#x27; Accusation Commission, at Samper&#x27;s own request. Afterward, Samper went on television to say that he had answered all &quot;the lies&quot; and vowed to serve out his term. It was considered unlikely that the commission, composed mostly of members from Samper&#x27;s own party, would recommend impeachment. A greater danger was the possibility that the supreme court would allow Valdivieso to investigate Samper. On 27 September, in an apparent attempt to force Samper to resign, two bodyguards of his attorney, Antonio José Cancino, were killed, with Cancino and another bodyguard wounded. On 14 December 1995, despite the publication in the magazine &quot;Cambio&quot; of the details of Pallomari&#x27;s accusations, the congressional commission voted against opening a formal investigation into the charges against Samper, although Colombian justice officials continued to investigate.

On 15 March 1996, the Colombian supreme court opened an investigation into three cabinet members—Horacio Serpa, Rodrigo Pardo and Juan Manuel Turbay—alleged to be involved in the scandal.

==President of Colombia==

On 7 August 1994, under tight security, Samper was sworn in as president in Plaza Bolívar, Bogotá, with foreign dignitaries such as Cuban president Fidel Castro and US interior secretary Bruce Babbitt in attendance. In his inauguration speech, he made the drug war a special priority while warning that no one was in a position to lecture Colombia on how to fight that war.

===Drug war===
In June 1995, Samper claimed that his administration had made considerable progress in fighting the drug war—which had cost Colombia &quot;countless lives&quot; in the previous ten years, &quot;including more than 3,000 police officers and soldiers, 23 judges, 63 journalists and four presidential candidates&quot;—by launching an &quot;integrated, multi-front attack on the cartels&quot; that targeted &quot;bank accounts, laboratories, crops, chemicals, transportation systems and political connections.&quot;

In June 1995, a money-laundering law was signed; and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, a leader of the Cali Cartel, was arrested, one of over 1,100 cartel members arrested so far in the year. By August, five more cartel leaders—Henry Loaiza-Ceballos, Victor Patiño-Fomeque, José Santacruz Londoño, Phanor Arizabaleta-Arzayus, and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela—had been arrested, leaving Hélmer Herrera the only top leader at large.

In the first half of 1995, about of coca crops and over of heroin crops were destroyed, much more than in 1994; more than of liquid chemicals and of solid chemicals were destroyed; of heroin were confiscated; and 243 drug labs were destroyed.

In 1995, Colombia&#x27;s Caribbean islands became bases from which the military could intercept drug shipments and communications. Unprecedented police operations in the city of Cali took place with the same objective of disrupting drug trafficking.

Under strong U.S. pressure, leaders of the Cali Cocaine cartel are targets of a massive manhunt involving about 6,000 troops. Now controlling about 80 percent of the global multibillion-dollar cocaine trade, the loose-knit Cali syndicate is considered... to be one of the most difficult criminal enterprises to penetrate. While... anti-narcotics efforts concentrated on the rival Medellín cartel in the 1980s, the Cali organization grew... Instead of fighting the state through a campaign of terrorism, the leaders here set out to buy influence and control the economy... all the leaders run separate trafficking, intelligence and security organizations, but they coordinate drug shipments and share information. With an intelligence apparatus encompassing hotel clerks, corrupt policemen and politicians and a taxi fleet of several thousand, the movements of police and army units are constantly monitored. To combat such corruption, Gen. Rosso José Serrano, commander of the National Police... [i]n the last two months... [has] kicked out 220 officers... 400 noncommissioned officers and 1,600 other policemen... soldiers assigned to anti-drug duty, members of an elite 150-man unit trained as a shock force[,] live in utter isolation... None of the soldiers... is from the Cali area...
In less than 30 days, five of the cartel&#x27;s seven most wanted members have been put behind bars. In thousands of raids on farms, houses, apartments and office buildings, police have found and seized weapons, drugs, money and—most importantly—business documents, accounts books and lists of payments essential to unraveling the drug lords&#x27; multi-billion dollar property and investment empire and their systematic bribes to politicians and other official protectors. &#x27;We use a hammer-and-anvil tactic,&#x27; said Colonel Argemiro Serna, commander of the Cali police, in a recent interview. &#x27;The search force raids suspected drug houses and possible hideouts, to try to flush them into movement. Then I send out units on roadblocks and aggressive random searches to trap them.&#x27; His boss, National Police Director Ross Serrano, described a more complex overall strategy—first closing down the private security agencies, taxi fleets and beeper companies that gave the cartel leaders bodyguards, safe transport and communications; arresting many of their messengers and lower-level employees to isolate them; and freezing their bank accounts to crimp cash flow.
However, with drug use in Europe on the rise, new markets opening up in Eastern Europe and Asia, and the United States reporting a 25% increase in cocaine-related medical emergencies since 1991, the continuing demand for drugs meant that drug trafficking would continue.

Samper stated that further measures to be taken should focus on increased international cooperation, including sharing information to speed up investigations and prosecutions, working toward implementing a treaty to stop cartel money laundering through established financial institutions, restricting the trade in precursor chemicals, enhancing international financial support for crop substitution, and holding a world summit on drugs.

===Foreign relations===
Shortly after Samper&#x27;s election and disturbed by the release of the taped phone conversations compromising the integrity of the president-elect, the US Senate unanimously approved a measure that would make anti-narcotic financial aid to Colombia conditional on the government&#x27;s commitment to fighting drug trafficking. In reply, Colombian foreign minister Noemí Sanín said that Colombia was prepared to fight the drug war without the United States, and that the measure was &quot;disrespectful&quot;.

On 1 March 1996, after an annual review of narcotics programs in 140 countries, U.S. President Clinton cut off most of his country&#x27;s over $1billion of economic aid to Colombia, saying that Colombia&#x27;s government was too corrupt to combat its country&#x27;s drug lords, although Colombia would continue to receive $37million in aid to combat narcotics trafficking. The United States would also seek to block loans from international organizations. For years, Samper&#x27;s administration was lambasted by the US for its supposed failure to make every effort to effectively fight the war against cocaine and the Cali Cartel. Additionally, the US revoked Samper&#x27;s visa and thereby effectively banned him from entering the country.

==Ambassadorship offer==
In July 2006, President Álvaro Uribe offered Samper Colombia&#x27;s ambassadorship to France. This led to the resignation of former President and Ambassador of Colombia to the United States, Andrés Pastrana, who criticized the decision. Opposition was also expressed by the media, political groups, and other segments of Colombian society. In the end, Samper did not accept the offer. 

==Secretary General of UNASUR==
In July 2014, Samper was named Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). He took office on 11 September 2014. During his inauguration ceremony in Caracas, Venezuela, Samper announced that he planned to focus on three agendas: political, social, and economic. He also announced plans to create a South American International Criminal Court to deal with regional criminal issues. Samper left office on 31 January 2017.

==Personal life==
Samper married Silvia Arbelaez with whom he had one son, Andrés. The couple divorced, and Samper married Jacquin Strouss Lucena on 16 June 1979, with whom he has two children, Miguel and Felipe.

==In popular culture==

<text>The Czechoslovakia national football team (, ) represented Czechoslovakia in men&#x27;s international football from 1919 to 1993. The team was controlled by the Czechoslovak Football Association, and the team qualified for eight World Cups and three European Championships. It had two runner-up finishes in World Cups, in 1934 and 1962, and won the European Championship in the 1976 tournament.

At the time of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the team was participating in UEFA qualifying Group 4 for the 1994 World Cup; it completed the remainder of this campaign under the name Representation of Czechs and Slovaks (RCS, , ) before it was disbanded. Both the Czech and Slovak national teams are considered to be the joint successors of the Czechoslovak record.

==History==
===Bohemia===
While part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Bohemia played its first international on 5 April 1903, a 2–1 loss for Hungary in Budapest. On 7 October, Hungary came to Prague for a 4–4 draw. The two countries played three more matches up to 1908, including Bohemia&#x27;s only victory on 6 October 1907. Bohemia played its last match on 13 June 1908, losing 4–0 at home to England.

After being expelled from FIFA due to objections from the Austrian Football Association, the ČSF founded the UIAFA along with French USFSA and English Amateur Football Association in March 1909. Bohemia won the UIAFA Great European football tournament in 1911, defeating the AFA England team 2–1 in the final.

===Inter-war===
After World War I, an independent Czechoslovakia made its first appearance in 1919 in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, a large sports competition organized in celebration of the Allied victory in the War. However, the matches of the tournament are not included in the official FIFA register. Czechoslovakia topped their group with three wins over Belgium, United States, and Canada, thus reaching the final, where they defeated the hosts France with a dramatic 3–2 win, thanks to two late goals from Antonín Janda.

In the following year, Czechoslovakia participated in the 1920 Olympic event in Antwerp, opening with a 7–0 win over Yugoslavia on 28 August. This squad, which had thirteen players from the Inter-Allied roster, then beat Norway 4–0 the next day in the quarter-finals and France 4–1 in the semi-finals on the 31st. However, in the final against Belgium on 2 September, the Czechoslovaks left the field 2–0 down after 40 minutes in protest with the English referee John Lewis, and were ejected from the tournament. Czechoslovakia returned for the 1924 Olympics in Paris and defeated Turkey 5–2 in the first round, but was eliminated in the second 1–0 against Switzerland in a replay after a 1–1 draw.

The nation entered the World Cup for the first time in 1934, and won its qualifier against Poland after its neighbor withdrew following a 2–1 Czechoslovak win in the first leg. At the finals in Italy, Czechoslovakia advanced past Romania, Switzerland, and Germany to reach the final, where it lost 2–1 to the host country after extra time. Oldřich Nejedlý won the Golden Shoe with five goals in the tournament.

Czechoslovakia qualified for the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France with a 7–1 aggregate victory over Bulgaria, and reached the quarter-finals with a 3–0 win over the Netherlands in Le Havre. In the quarter-final against Brazil, known as the Battle of Bordeaux for its rough play, Czechoslovakia lost the replay 2–1.

In 1939, under the German occupation name of &quot;Bohemia&quot;, the team played three matches, defeating Yugoslavia 7–3 and drawing with both Ostmark (occupied Austria) and Germany itself.

===Post-World War II===

After an absence from the 1950 qualification campaign, Czechoslovakia qualified for 1954 by topping its qualifying group unbeaten against Bulgaria and Romania with three wins and a draw. However, in the finals in Switzerland, it was eliminated from a strong group after defeats to Uruguay and Austria.

It also topped its qualifying group for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, ahead of Wales and East Germany. They opened their finals campaign on 8 June with a 1–0 defeat to Northern Ireland in Halmstad, followed by a 2–2 draw with reigning champions West Germany and a 6–1 win over Argentina. On 17 June, Czechoslovakia lost a play-off to advance into the knockout stages 2–1 to Northern Ireland in Malmö.

===Modern age===
On 5 April 1959, Czechoslovakia played the first ever qualifying match in a UEFA European Championship, losing 2–0 away to the Republic of Ireland but eventually advancing 4–2 on aggregate. Subsequent victories over Denmark (7–3 aggregate) and Romania (5–0 aggregate) put the country into the four-team finals in France. It lost 3–0 to the Soviet Union in the semi-final but gained third place with a 2–0 win over the hosts at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille.

Czechoslovakia qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile by defeating Scotland 4–2 after extra time in a play-off in Brussels, Belgium, after finishing level in their qualifying group. In the group at the finals, Czechoslovakia opened with a 1–0 win over Spain from a Jozef Štibrányi goal, and then drew 0–0 with holders Brazil. In the last group game on 7 June, Václav Mašek put Czechoslovakia ahead against Mexico in 12 seconds; the team lost 3–1 but advanced nonetheless.

After goalkeeper Viliam Schrojf&#x27;s performance, a goal from Adolf Scherer in Rancagua was enough to beat Hungary in the quarter-final, and two more late goals by him against Yugoslavia put Czechoslovakia into their second World Cup final. In the final at the Estadio Nacional de Chile in Santiago, Josef Masopust put Czechoslovakia ahead after 15 minutes by finishing Scherer&#x27;s pass, but Brazil soon equalised and exploited Schrojf&#x27;s errors to win 3–1. Masopust&#x27;s inspiration was awarded with the 1962 Ballon d&#x27;Or.
Czechoslovakia did not go to the 1966 FIFA World Cup, with Portugal topping their qualifying group, nor did they qualify for the European Championships of 1964 and 1968. On 3 December 1969, they defeated Hungary 4–1 in Marseille in a play-off to reach the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, having finished joint top of their qualifying group. Czechoslovakia lost all three of their matches in the 1970 World Cup, in a group featuring holders England and eventual winners Brazil.

After missing out on the 1972 European Championship and the 1974 World Cup, Czechoslovakia reached the 1976 European Championship in Yugoslavia, topping a group featuring England, Portugal, and Cyprus, before defeating the Soviet Union 4–2 in a play-off. In the semi-final in Zagreb, they advanced after beating the Netherlands 3–1 after extra time. In the final on 20 June at Crvena Zvezda Stadium in Belgrade, Czechoslovakia led 2–0 before the game went to penalties at a 2–2 draw. Antonin Panenka scored the winning penalty with a chip, subsequently referred to by his name when executed by other players. In that squad, 16 of 22 players in the squad were Slovak and in both matches in the final tournament, 9 of 13 players were Slovak.
Czechoslovakia did not qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, as Scotland won their group. The country did qualify for Euro 1980, and by coming second in its group behind West Germany faced the hosts Italy in a third-place play-off, which it won on sudden-death penalties at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. At the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, Czechoslovakia was eliminated in the group stage after draws with Kuwait and France and losing 2–0 to England. The country&#x27;s last major tournament was the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, where in the group it opened with a 5–1 victory against the United States before defeating Austria with a penalty from Michal Bilek, enough to advance despite losing 2–0 to the hosts at the Stadio Olimpico. In the last 16 at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, a hat-trick from Tomáš Skuhravý featured in a 4–1 in over Costa Rica. Czechoslovakia was eliminated on 1 July in a quarter-final at the San Siro, losing 1–0 from a Lothar Matthäus penalty against eventual winners West Germany. Later that month, manager Jozef Vengloš who had led Czechoslovakia in the tournament was appointed as the first foreign manager in English football, at Aston Villa. Czechoslovakia (RCS) played their last qualifier for the USA 1994 FIFA World Cup in the no longer existing common republic, where they played their last match on 17 November 1993 against Belgium in Brussels. Since the game was for direct advancement from the group stage, RCS did not advance after a goalless draw. The RCS top scorer with six goals was Peter Dubovský, who scored a hat-trick in the match against Romania in Všešportový areál on 2 June 1993.

<text>Rebellion Developments Limited is a British video game developer based in Oxford, England. Founded by Jason and Chris Kingsley in December 1992, the company is best known for &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; and multiple games in the &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; series. Sister company Rebellion Publishing has published comic books since 2000, when it purchased &quot;2000 AD&quot;, the publisher of characters such as Judge Dredd and Rogue Trooper. In the 2010s the studio saw growth and success with their &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; series of games. The series has spanned 5 mainline installments and multiple spin-offs, including the Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army entries. Their new title, Atomfall is due for release in 2025. 

== History ==
===Origins (1992–1999)===
Rebellion was founded on 4 December 1992 by brothers Jason and Chris Kingsley in Oxford, England. The pair had just finished academic degrees at the University of Oxford, and had ambitions of starting doctorates. In their spare time, they did freelance work in the games industry. When their freelance jobs roles began to expand and they were taking on more management responsibilities, they decided to establish Rebellion in Oxford. The foundation of the studio was laid when the brothers secured a deal with video game publisher Atari UK. They presented a 3D dragon flight game demo to directors at the publisher, who were seeking games for the upcoming Atari Jaguar system. They were commissioned by Atari to work on two titles for the Jaguar, &quot;Checkered Flag&quot; and &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot;, which both released in 1994. The development team was expanded to assist with work on these games. It included artists Stuart Wilson, Toby Banfield, and Justin Rae, along with programmers Mike Beaton, Rob Dibley, and Andrew Whittaker. Following &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot;, Rebellion saw no releases for some years, with their next project, the intentionally light-hearted PC game &quot;Mr. Tank&quot;, going unpublished. 

===Expansion and comics (2000–2009)===
Over the course of the decade, Rebellion underwent rapid expansion with numerous acquisitions of other studios and properties. This wave of expansions included the purchase of &quot;2000 AD&quot; from Fleetway Publications, which began Rebellion&#x27;s first foray into comic books. In addition to further publications under the label, Rebellion began to develop associated characters for the games market. In 2003 Rebellion released the game &quot;Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death&quot;.

In 2004, Rebellion entered a deal with DC Comics to reprint several &quot;2000 AD&quot; stories in trade paperback form, including &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, &quot;Nikolai Dante&quot;, and &quot;Sinister Dexter&quot;. When DC left the venture, citing poor sales, Rebellion created its own line of American graphic novels that were distributed through Simon &amp; Schuster. In 2005 Rebellion also created the series &quot;Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files&quot;, which has begun reprinting almost every appearance of Judge Dredd in chronological order.

Rebellion&#x27;s 2005 game &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; was awarded &quot;Best PC/Console Game&quot; in the TIGA Awards of 2005. Following the release, Rebellion acquired numerous games studios and properties. This began in 2006 with the purchase of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; developers Core Design from Eidos Interactive, as well as Strangelite from Empire Interactive, and Elixir Studios&#x27; former IPs including &quot;Evil Genius&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The acquisitions made Rebellion the largest independent game developer in Europe.

Acquisitions later in the decade were predominantly associated with the growing publishing wing of the company, including Blackfish Publishing and Mongoose Publishing in 2008, followed by Cubicle 7 and Solaris Books in 2009. On 14 July 2009, the company purchased the &quot;Ground Control&quot;, &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, &quot;Lords of Magic&quot; and &quot;Lords of the Realm&quot; franchises from Activision. These were ex-Sierra Entertainment properties that the company offloaded due to their new long-term strategy following the Vivendi Games merger.

===Closure of Derby studio (2009–2010)===

In 2009, Rebellion&#x27;s &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot; game received poor reviews. This was followed by &quot;Aliens vs. Predator&quot; in 2010, published by Sega, which received a mixed critical reception, but debuted at number one on the UK all formats chart. Significant changes were made in 2010, including staff cuts at their main studio in Oxford as well as the closure of Rebellion Derby – the former Core Design studio which had only been purchased four years previously. Studio CEO Jason Kingsley discussed pivoting their focus to smaller titles in the wake of the changes. The move coincided with the end of a property lease. Kingsley commented that &quot;growth is sometimes painful, never more so than in the current climate and we have had to take a long hard look at how we operate our studio network. Strategically we have decided to review the need for the Derby facilities.&quot;

====Controversy====
Following the closure of the Derby studio, the company was accused by laid off employees and their spouses of withholding wages and severance pay. The studio was further accused of not paying legal fees for staff members who sought &quot;legal help during the redundancy consultation period&quot;.

===Return to growth (2011–present)===
The mid 2010s saw major successes with the &quot;Sniper Elite&quot; franchise. The company returned to expansion through the purchase of additional studios and properties, expanding both their computer game and publishing sectors, and further diversified into live action film late in the decade. Kingsley was awarded an OBE in 2012 for his work supporting the sector.

In July 2013, Rebellion bought the &quot;Battlezone&quot; and the &quot;Moonbase Commander &quot;franchises during the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. Cubicle 7 left Rebellion in December 2014 via management buyout. &quot;Sniper Elite III&quot; was released that year, and by September 2015 the series had passed 10 million copies sold worldwide.

In August 2016, Rebellion acquired the post-1970 IPC Youth and Fleetway comics libraries from Egmont. It reprinted these under its Treasury of British Comics imprint, including &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Wildcat&quot; and &quot;One-Eyed Jack&quot;. This would be followed by an acquisition of the pre-1970 titles from the group in 2018.

In November 2018, Rebellion set up a studio for a film and TV series based on 2000 AD characters, the first projects being &quot;Judge Dredd: Mega-City One&quot; and &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot;, both directed by Duncan Jones. Rebellion Productions, the film production arm founded in 2017, would occupy a disused newspaper factory in Didcot, England. The studio would launch its first feature film in 2021.

Several games related acquisitions would be made through 2018 and 2019, including the Radiant Worlds, rebranded &quot;Rebellion Warwick&quot; and TickTock games, rebranded &quot;Rebellion North&quot;. Rebellion acquired The Bitmap Brothers&#x27; library of classic games in 2019.

In 2020 Rebellion acquired &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, publishing an edition in the following year, but it announced that there would be no 2022 edition.

In 2021 Rebellion announced a new bi-monthly humour comic, &quot;Monster Fun&quot;, would begin in 2022.

<doc id="974136" wikidata="Q2377188" url="?curid=974136" title="Foyle's War">
<text>Foyle&#x27;s War is a British detective drama television series set during and shortly after the Second World War, created by &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; screenwriter and author Anthony Horowitz and commissioned by ITV after the long-running series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; ended in 2000. It began broadcasting on ITV in October 2002. ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps cancelled &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; in 2007, but Peter Fincham (Shaps&#x27; replacement) revived the programme after good ratings for 2008&#x27;s fifth series. The final episode was broadcast on 18 January 2015, after eight series.

==Description==
Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen), a widower, is quiet, methodical, sagacious, scrupulously honest and frequently underestimated by his foes. Many of his cases concern profiteering, the black market and murder, and he is often called on to catch criminals who are taking advantage of the confusion created by the war. Although Foyle often comes up against high-ranking officials in the British military or intelligence services who would prefer that he mind his own business, he seeks justice tenaciously. Throughout the series, he is assisted by his driver, Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), and Detective Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell).

The first six series are set during the Second World War in Hastings, Sussex, England. In series seven, Foyle works after retirement for MI5 on Cold War espionage. The stories are largely self-contained. There are some running plot strands, primarily involving the career of Foyle&#x27;s son Andrew Foyle (Julian Ovenden) – a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force – or Foyle&#x27;s relationships with minor characters. Each episode runs for 90 to 100 minutes, filling a two-hour time slot on ITV when commercials are included.

==Production==
In a newspaper article and an interview accompanying the series-one DVD set, Horowitz explained that he was seeking a name which evoked the early 1940s. He thought of Foyles bookshop in London&#x27;s Charing Cross Road, once known for its archaic business practices and its owner, Christina Foyle; Christopher was the nearest male name to Christina. After Christina Foyle&#x27;s death, control of Foyles passed in 1999 to her nephew Christopher. Christopher Foyle made a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, although his scene was cut from PBS airings in the US.

The series is also notable for its attention to historical detail, and the drama is frequently moved along by historical events of the Second World War. Horowitz considered that to honour the veterans of the war it was important to get the details correct. As the series progressed, he became more interested in the &quot;murder mystery&quot; format than the portrayal of history and exploration of the Home Front. Nevertheless, the Imperial War Museum is credited in an advisory capacity in some episodes.

St Just, in Croft Road, Hastings, was used as the location for Foyle&#x27;s home.

===Cancellation and revival===
After five series, &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; was cancelled abruptly by ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps. This forced Horowitz to discard scripts set during most of 1943 and 1944, resulting in time jumps of nine months to a year between episodes; previous series had gaps of a month at most. In April 2008, the presumed final episode, &quot;All Clear&quot; (during which the end of the war is announced) was broadcast.

On 9 April 2008, however, ITV announced that it was negotiating with Horowitz and Greenlit Productions to revive the series and continue Foyle&#x27;s adventures beyond VE Day; some media observers saw high viewing figures for the penultimate episode (a 28-percent audience share) on 13 April as strengthening the case for continuing. When the audience figures for the final episode were released (28 percent and an average of 7.3 million viewers), ITV confirmed that it had entered &quot;early discussions&quot; with Horowitz and Greenlit. The negotiations led to &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; recommissioning for an additional three series. Series six began filming in February 2009 and premiered on UK television on 11 April 2010. Series seven was filmed in Ireland and London from late August to December 2012, and was broadcast in the UK in March and April 2013. Series eight, three two-hour episodes, aired in the UK in January 2015.

===Foyle&#x27;s Last Case===
Even after this second cancellation, Horowitz continued to hold out hope for some sort of revival, spin-off around Honeysuckle Weeks&#x27;s character, or even just some Christmas specials.
An example of the later concept was even developed by Horowitz as Foyle&#x27;s Last Case, an exclusive two-part Christmas short story for The Daily Mail newspaper, published there on the 22 and 23 December 2018.

Acorn Media contracted Cre-a-TV to repackage &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; in two-part episodes to run in PBS&#x27; time slots. The episodes were fed by satellite to the public-television system by former PBS affiliate KCET in Los Angeles (now an independent station), and public TV stations began rebroadcasting the series in the fall of 2011. Each episode was aired in two parts, each in a one-hour time slot (usually separated by a week), and each part ran about 50 minutes.

==Awards==
&quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; was nominated in the Best Production Design category for the 2003 BAFTA Television Awards, and won a Lew Grade Award for Best Entertainment Programme that year. The series was nominated for the 2004 BAFTA Best Drama Series award. That year, Honeysuckle Weeks was nominated for the 10th National Television Awards&#x27; Most Popular Newcomer award.

==Media==
===DVD releases===
In the UK, the first four series of &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; were released as two two-disc DVDs per series, with two episodes each and episode titles instead of series numbers. In March 2007, UK and US distributor Acorn Media began re-releasing series 1–3 as four-disc DVDs for the UK (as they had in the US) and labelling them with series numbers. A complete box set of the series is available.

===Blu-ray releases===
All but the last two series have been released on Blu-ray in Australia (all discs are region-free). While it may appear the &quot;complete collection&quot; box set includes seven seasons, there are only the first six series included. This is due to Icon entertainment releasing parts 1 &amp; 2 of series four as seasons 4 &amp; 5 respectively. Hence after the fourth season the Australian season numbering is one greater than the series that is included in the release.

===Other media releases===
Hastings Borough Council and Rod Green have produced books to accompany the popular series and these go behind the scenes, as well as celebrate aspects of the series. Notable authors on the town during this period and who are acknowledged in these books as offering further information are Nathan Dylan Goodwin, Victoria Seymour and Mary Haskell Porter.

<doc id="974140" wikidata="Q1431571" url="?curid=974140" title="Better dead than red">
<text>&quot;Better dead than red&quot; and the reverse &quot;better red than dead&quot; are dueling slogans regarding communism, and generally socialism, the former an anti-communist slogan (&quot;rather dead than a communist&quot;), and the latter a pro-communist slogan (&quot;rather a communist than dead&quot;). The slogans are interlingual with a variety of variants amongst them.

== Etymology ==
Red is the emblematic color of communism and has thus become a synonym for &quot;communist&quot; (plural &quot;reds&quot;). Thus &quot;better dead than red&quot; means that &#x27;one would rather die or be dead than to become or be a communist&#x27;, and vice versa.

== History ==
The slogans became widespread during the Cold War, first gaining currency in the United States during the late 1950s, amid debates about anti-communism and nuclear disarmament.

The first phrase, &quot;better red than dead&quot;, is often credited to British philosopher Bertrand Russell, but in his 1961 &quot;Has Man a Future?&quot; he attributes it to &quot;West German friends of peace&quot;. In any event, Russell agreed with the sentiment, having written in 1958 that if &quot;no alternatives remain except Communist domination or extinction of the human race, the former alternative is the lesser of two evils&quot;, and the slogan was adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which he helped found.

The first known English-language use of either term came in 1930, long before their widespread popularity. In an editorial criticizing John Edgerton, a Tennessee businessman who had mandated morning prayers in his factories to help keep out &quot;dangerous ideas&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot; sarcastically wrote:

The first known use of &quot;better red than dead&quot; came in August 1958, when the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The popular phrase &#x27;better red than dead&#x27; has lost what appeal it ever had.&quot; As anti-communist fever took hold in mid-century, the version &quot;better dead than red&quot; became popular in the United States, especially during the McCarthy era. The quote was also used by Oleg Troyanovsky, the Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations in 1980 when a dissident Marxist group threw red paint on him and US ambassador William vanden Heuvel in the United Nations Security Council chamber.

With the end of the Cold War, the phrases have increasingly been repurposed as their original meanings have waned. For example, &quot;better dead than red&quot; is sometimes used as a schoolyard taunt aimed at redhaired children or Chinese American children. Some American alt-right groups such as Patriot Front have also used the phrase in their propaganda, in particular against Chinese Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

The phrases may have been invented or inspired by Germans. Folklorist Mac E. Barrick linked it to &quot;Lewwer duad üs Slaav &quot;(&quot;better dead than a slave&quot;), a phrase used by Prussian poet Detlev von Liliencron in his ballad &quot;&quot;. Later, in Nazi Germany, &quot;Slav &quot;replaced &quot;Slaav&quot;, giving the anti-Slavic &quot;better dead than a Slav&quot;.

Also during the Nazi period, &quot;lieber tot als rot&quot; (&quot;better dead than red&quot;) was used as a slogan. It is unclear whether it was the inspiration for either of the English phrases. The opposite slogan, &quot;lieber rot als tot&quot; (&quot;better red than dead&quot;), was popular among German speakers during the Cold War as well.

In the strong pacifist movement in France in 1937, Jean Giono, a leading spokesman, asked, &quot;What&#x27;s the worst that can happen if Germany invades France? Become Germans? For my part, I prefer being a living German to being a dead Frenchman.&quot;

Another version of the phrase took hold in Francoist Spain, adapted to &quot;Antes roja que rota&quot; (&quot;better red than broken&quot;), in reference to the threat posed by separatist groups in the regions of Catalonia and the Basque Country.

During Romanian revolt of 1990 a song Imnul golanilor by Cristian Pațurcă was written, that has become an anthem of the revolt. It contains the words &quot;Mai bine mort, decât comunist&quot;, which means &quot;Better dead than communist&quot;.

<text>The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards (GGFG) is the senior reserve infantry regiment in the Canadian Army. Located in Ottawa at the Cartier Square Drill Hall, the regiment is a Primary Reserve infantry unit, and the members are part-time soldiers.

The GGFG are infantry reserve soldiers who train part-time and full-time for domestic operations and international missions. This involves training for domestic operations where the unit deployed members to help during a natural disaster or public emergency such as it did during the 1998 Ice Storm, flooding in 2017 and 2019, and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It also involves training for international operations and support to the Regular Force on operations in countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Latvia, and Ukraine where troops from the regiment have deployed in recent years.

Members of the GGFG train part time between September and June, usually Tuesday evenings and one weekend a month. Between May and August, members can be employed full time in a variety of roles such as students or instructors on training courses, taking part in tasks such as the Ceremonial Guard, and attending field exercises.

The regiment also runs supplementary training programs such as the marksmanship program to improve shooting skills, and the leadership development training program to prepare soldiers to attend leadership courses. Additionally the regiment runs sports and fitness programs. The GGFG are also affiliated with 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (1 RCR) for reserve integration training.

The GGFG perpetuate the 2nd Canadian Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and 77th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF, from the First World War.

==Regimental structure==

The regiment is composed of the following sub-units:
* Regimental Headquarters Regimental Headquarters is responsible for the overall command, control, and administration of all members of the regiment.
* No. 1 Company (Rifle Company) The rifle company conducts collective field training exercises to train soldiers to work together as a team across a range of tactical scenarios. Most of the trained soldiers in the regiment are part of the rifle company.
* No. 2 Company (Training Company) The training company runs individual training courses so members can become qualified or complete specialized courses.  It is composed of instructors and students taking part in individual training courses. New members of the regiment are members of the training company until they are fully trained.
* No. 3 Company (Combat Service Support) The Support Company provides logistical support to the training being conducted by No. 1 and 2 Companies.
* GGFG Band The regimental band is a brass-and-reed band that represents the regiment at performances around the city and beyond.
* Public Duties Company Public Duties Company (PD Coy) plans and conducts the Ceremonial Guard during the summer months as well as supporting the governor general and Rideau Hall with ceremonial tasks throughout the year.

The regiment also supports the 2784 GGFG Army Cadets of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets.

The PD Coy, given the suspension of Ceremonial Guard activities owing to the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020, is ad interim the official guard of honour of the Canadian Armed Forces. This status will continue until the Guard&#x27;s reconstitution.

==Lineage==

The GGFG originated in Ottawa, Ontario, on 7 June 1872 as the 1st Battalion Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards. It was redesignated as the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards on 16 September 1887; as The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards on 1 April 1896; as the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion, The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards on 7 November 1941; as The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards on 31 January 1946; as The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards (5th Battalion, The Canadian Guards) on 1 September 1954; as the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards (5th Battalion, The Canadian Guards) on 25 April 1958; and finally returned to the name &quot;Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards&quot; on 1 September 1976.

In the Canadian Forces, units may make formal, official links between each other called &quot;affiliations&quot;. These affiliations are &quot;to foster continuous fraternal connections between military organizations beyond the close, professional relationships which are always encouraged.&quot; The GGFG were affiliated with the Canadian Guards, and from 1954 to 1976 they used a Canadian Guards battalion number in token of the affiliation. Despite the battalion number, the GGFG were considered a separate regiment from the Canadian Guards. The affiliation automatically ceased when the Canadian Guards were put on the Supplementary Order of Battle in 1970.








==Operational history==
Members of the regiment took part in the Nile Expedition of 1884 and the following year provided a company of sharpshooters to the Battleford column during the North-West Rebellion, where the regiment suffered its first two casualties at the Battle of Cut Knife Hill. The company was removed from active service on 24 July 1885.

During the Second Boer War the regiment contributed volunteers for the various Canadian contingents, mainly the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry.

===Great War===
The GGFG perpetuates two battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force who took part in the First World War.

The 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF &quot;The Iron Second&quot;, which was a part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division and saw continuous service on the Western front from 1915 to end of war in 1918.  The 2nd Battalion also fought at the battles of Ypres, St. Julien, Festubert, Pozières, Vimy (1917), Arleux, Hill 70, Passchendaele, Amiens, and Canal du Nord, to name only a few. By the end of the war, 242 officers and 5,084 other ranks had fought with the battalion. Of those, 52 officers and 1,227 other ranks were killed.

The 77th Battalion (Ottawa), CEF was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 19 June 1916. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until 22 September 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 47th Battalion (British Columbia), CEF and 73rd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF and the battalion was disbanded.

The honours and traditions of these battalions are perpetuated by the GGFG.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War the GGFG was mobilized in May 1940.  In 1942 the regiment was re-rolled to become an armoured unit to address the need for more armoured units in the Canadian Army, assuming the name &quot;21st Canadian Armoured Regiment (GGFG)&quot;. It embarked for Great Britain on 23 September 1942. On 24 July 1944, it landed in France as part of the 4th Armoured Brigade, 4th Canadian Armoured Division and it continued to fight in northwest Europe until the end of the war taking part in the battle of Normandy, the battle of the Scheldt, and the Rhineland. Over the course of the war the regiment&#x27;s casualties were 101 dead and 284 wounded. The overseas regiment was disbanded on 31 January 1946.

===Modern day===
In the intervening years, members have participated in United Nations and NATO operations, including service in the Cyprus, Somalia, the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Haiti, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone. During the Canadian mission in Afghanistan, the GGFG deployed members, taking part Task Force 3-06, Task Force 3-08, and Task Force 1-10 in Kandahar, as well as the Operation Attention training mission in Kabul.

The GGFG provides individual augmentation to the Regular Force when they deploy on operations. The regiment deployed members on Operation Impact in Iraq and Jordan, Operation Calumet in Egypt, Operation Soprano in Sudan, Operation Reassurance in Poland and Latvia, and Operation Unifier in Ukraine.
The regiment maintains domestic response capability to support Canadians at home in natural disasters or emergencies. The regiment deployed soldiers to the 1998 Ice Storm, floods 2017 and 2019, and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

==Rank names==
; Ensign : Second lieutenants (OF-1) in Guard regiments are referred by their former title of ensign (Esgn). The name derives from the task the newest joined officers were entrusted with, carrying the ensign or colours.
; Colour sergeant : Personnel carrying the rank of warrant officer (OR-7) in Guard regiments are called by their former title of colour sergeant (CSgt). This rank originated from the appointment of specific sergeants to escort and defend the colours. Lower ranks refer to colour sergeants as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; rather than &quot;Warrant&quot; as in other units.
; Guardsman : Upon successful completion of recruit training soldiers are addressed as guardsman (Gdsm/OR-3). King George V awarded this honour in 1918 to mark the service of regiments of Foot Guards during the First World War. General Order 138 of 1928 promulgates this honour.
; Musician : Upon successful completion of recruit training members of the band are addressed as musician (Muscn/OR-3). 

==Regimental museum==
The Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards Regimental Museum collects, preserves, studies and exhibits those objects that serve to illustrate
the history and traditions of the regiment. The museum will collect materials that depict the regiment&#x27;s past in terms of war, ceremonial, training, sport and other affairs that have influenced the regiment over the years. The museum will provide for the preservation of such material and for its availability to all those who wish to see and study it. The museum will be a non-profit educational establishment, operated for the regiment and open to the public, regardless of race, creed, or occupation. The museum will disseminate knowledge and stimulate interest through materials, information services by holding meetings and arranging special programs for the regiment, the association and the public for the furtherance of the purpose of the museum. The museum co-operates with the regiment, association, the National War Museum and other museums as well as the Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, to collect and preserve materials of significance so that these materials may be preserved and aid in the advancement of knowledge of the regiment. The Guards&#x27; museum holds many artifacts from throughout the history of the regiment. Some of the artifacts displayed are a captured German trench periscope, various firearms from past wars including a Second World War–era German MG42, an MP 40, and a copy of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; signed by Adolf Hitler. Also on display are several books containing photographs from World War II. The museum is located in the south end of the Cartier Square Drill Hall and is open on parade nights or by appointment.

<text>In mathematics, an automorphic function is a function on a space that is invariant under the action of some group, in other words a function on the quotient space. Often the space is a complex manifold and the group is a discrete group.

==Factor of automorphy==
In mathematics, the notion of factor of automorphy arises for a group acting on a complex-analytic manifold. Suppose a group formula_1 acts on a complex-analytic manifold formula_2. Then, formula_1 also acts on the space of holomorphic functions from formula_2 to the complex numbers. A function formula_5 is termed an &quot;automorphic form&quot; if the following holds:

: formula_6

where formula_7 is an everywhere nonzero holomorphic function. Equivalently, an automorphic form is a function whose divisor is invariant under the action of formula_1.

The &quot;factor of automorphy&quot; for the automorphic form formula_5 is the function formula_10. An &quot;automorphic function&quot; is an automorphic form for which formula_10 is the identity.

Some facts about factors of automorphy:

* Every factor of automorphy is a cocycle for the action of formula_1 on the multiplicative group of everywhere nonzero holomorphic functions.
* The factor of automorphy is a coboundary if and only if it arises from an everywhere nonzero automorphic form.
* For a given factor of automorphy, the space of automorphic forms is a vector space.
* The pointwise product of two automorphic forms is an automorphic form corresponding to the product of the corresponding factors of automorphy.

Relation between factors of automorphy and other notions:

* Let formula_13 be a lattice in a Lie group formula_1. Then, a factor of automorphy for formula_13 corresponds to a line bundle on the quotient group formula_16. Further, the automorphic forms for a given factor of automorphy correspond to sections of the corresponding line bundle.

The specific case of formula_13 a subgroup of &quot;SL&quot;(2, R), acting on the upper half-plane, is treated in the article on automorphic factors.

<doc id="974151" wikidata="Q721743" url="?curid=974151" title="Congressional Gold Medal">
<text>The Congressional Gold Medal is the oldest and highest civilian award in the United States, alongside the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is bestowed by vote of the United States Congress, signed into law by the president. The Gold Medal expresses the highest national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals or institutions.

The congressional practice of issuing gold medals to occasionally honor recipients began with members of the military during the American Revolution. The practice soon extended to individuals in all walks of life and in the late 20th century also to groups. The congressional medal honors those, individually or as a group, &quot;who have performed an achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient&#x27;s field long after the achievement.&quot; 

There is no general statutory scheme for creation of the award. When a Congressional Gold Medal is deemed appropriate, Congress provides for the creation of each medal by passing a law to that effect. Each chamber of Congress (the House and the Senate) imposes super-majority sponsorship rules to begin consideration. Each medal is ordered to be uniquely designed and cast in gold by the United States Mint. Thus, there are significantly fewer gold medals than presidential medals. U.S. citizenship is not a requirement. , 184 people, events, or institutions have been awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.

==History==

Since the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned gold medals as its highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions. The medal was first awarded in 1776 by the Second Continental Congress to General George Washington. Although the first recipients were military figures who participated in the American Revolution, the War of 1812 and the Mexican–American War, Congress broadened the scope of the medal to include actors, authors, entertainers, musicians, pioneers in aeronautics and space, explorers, lifesavers, notables in science and medicine, athletes, humanitarians, public servants, and foreign recipients. The medal is normally awarded to persons, but in 1979 the American Red Cross became the first organization to be honored with a gold medal.

, at least 7 people had been awarded more than one gold medal: Winfield Scott (1814 for the War of 1812 and 1848 for the Mexican–American War), Zachary Taylor (1846, 1847, and 1848 for the Mexican–American War), Lincoln Ellsworth (1928 and 1936 for polar exploration), Hyman G. Rickover (1958 for the &quot;Nuclear Navy&quot; and 1982 for his entire career), Staff Sergeant Warner Katz (Office of Strategic Services and Merrill&#x27;s Marauders WW2 also the first Merrill&#x27;s Marauder to kill a Japanese Soldier), Ranger Randall Ching and Ranger Raymond Lee (2020 for serving in WW2 as a Chinese-American and 2022 for serving as a US army ranger).

== Process of awarding ==
A difference between a Congressional Gold Medal and a Presidential Medal of Freedom is that the Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded in the discretion of the President of the United States, while Congressional Gold Medals are awarded by an Act of Congress which becomes law.

Per committee rules, legislation bestowing a Congressional Gold Medal upon a recipient must be co-sponsored by two-thirds of the membership of both the House of Representatives and the Senate before their respective committees—the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs—will consider it.

A Congressional Gold Medal is designed by the United States Mint to specifically commemorate the person and achievement for which the medal is awarded. Medals are therefore different in appearance, and there is no standard design. Congressional Gold Medals are considered non-portable, meaning that they are not meant to be worn on a uniform or other clothing, but rather displayed.

In rare instances, miniature versions have been made or converted for wear on clothing, suspended from a ribbon. Examples are the Cardenas Medal for Frank H. Newcomb, the Jarvis Medal for David H. Jarvis, the Jeannette Medal for the men of the &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition, the Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal for the men of the First Byrd expedition of 1928–1930, and the NC-4 Medal for the men who completed the first transatlantic flight in May 1919. The latter was authorized in 1935 by allowing the Secretary of the Navy to authorize—at his discretion—the wearing of commemorative or other special awards on Navy or Marine Corps uniforms, in military-sized form.

Often, bronze versions of the medals are struck for sale by the U.S. Mint, and may be available in both larger and smaller sizes. In at least one case, the John Wayne Congressional Medal, private dealers bought large numbers of the bronze version. They were then gold plated and resold to the public for a significant profit.

The Congressional Gold Medal is distinct from the Medal of Honor, a military decoration for extreme bravery in action, and from the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, presented by NASA for extraordinary accomplishment in United States space exploration.

<text>James B. Hickey (born October 1, 1960) is a retired U.S. Army colonel. In December 2003, he led Operation Red Dawn, the U.S. military effort that captured Saddam Hussein near Tikrit, Iraq.
==Military career==

Hickey attended St. Laurence High School in Burbank, Illinois, and is a 1982 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute. On December 13, 2003, Colonel Hickey led the raid entitled &quot;Operation Red Dawn&quot; that captured Saddam Hussein in Tikrit, Iraq.

After graduating from the Virginia Military Institute, Hickey was commissioned into the U.S. Army in 1982.

His first assignment was with the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in Schweinfurt, Germany, where he served as a cavalry platoon leader, troop executive officer and squadron adjutant from 1982 to 1985. Then-Captain Hickey attended the Infantry Officer&#x27;s Advance Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and then returned to Germany in 1986. Thereafter he took command of L Troop, 3rd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment &quot;Blackhorse&quot; in Bad Hersfeld.

After command, Captain Hickey&#x27;s next assignments were part of his secondary career field, Foreign Area Officer (Russian linguist) and included the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (master&#x27;s of international public policy) and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Russian Institute in Garmisch, Germany.

Lieutenant Colonel Hickey was selected to command 2nd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment in 1999 at Fort Carson, Colorado, after four years at the Army&#x27;s premier combat training center at Fort Irwin, California. Lieutenant Colonel Hickey commanded the squadron through operational and training deployments in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the U.S. Army&#x27;s most challenging combined arms training centers.

In April 2003, after attending Georgetown University as a U.S. Army Senior Service College Fellow, Colonel Hickey deployed to Iraq to work at the Headquarters of the 4th Infantry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

On June 13, 2003 he took command of 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) and led the brigade through a year of combat operations in Saladin Province. Colonel Hickey, supported by Special Operations units, led the raid that captured Saddam Hussein on 13 December 2003. For this and recognized combat effectiveness, the &quot;Raider Brigade&quot; was recognized by the Secretary of the Army with the Valorous Unit Award.

After brigade command Colonel Hickey performed joint staff duties at the Institute of Defense Analysis in Alexandria, Virginia. During this assignment he performed sensitive intelligence analysis which led to his reassignment to the Iraq Theatre of Operations under the command of Lieutenant General Raymond T. Odierno in 2006. Colonel Hickey helped plan and oversee the execution of the &quot;Surge&quot; in direct support of the corps commanding general. He was credited by the commanding general for the dramatic reduction of improvised explosive device attacks against coalition troops due to the efforts of Colonel Hickey&#x27;s Counter IED Operations Integration Cell.

Decorated for gallantry, valor and merit, Colonel Hickey&#x27;s decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star for Valor, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Iraq Campaign Medal, Four Stars and the Valorous Unit Award.

He was also interviewed and shown on the Military Channel show &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;, and he featured in TV documentaries such as &quot;Zero Hour&quot;,
2003 &quot;BBC World News&quot; and 2009 &quot;The Surge: The Whole Story&quot;. Colonel Hickey is heavily featured in the book by Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Steve Russell entitled &quot;We Got Him&quot;.

After retiring from the army, Colonel Hickey served for years as vice president for ACADEMI&#x27;s Security and Professional Services Business Unit (formerly Blackwater). In January 2015, he began work for Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as his senior military advisor. In January 2019, Colonel Hickey accepted a position as a vice president with Raytheon Intelligence and Space. 

Colonel Hickey has been married to the former Maureen Kelly of Arlington, Virginia, since 1983.

<text>José Francisco Molina Jiménez (born 8 August 1970) is a Spanish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper, currently manager of Indian Super League club Mohun Bagan Super Giant.

Eleven years of his extensive professional career were spent at Atlético Madrid and Deportivo de La Coruña, where he won a total of five titles. Over 14 seasons, he appeared in 415 La Liga matches.

A Spain international for four years, Molina represented the nation at the 1998 World Cup and two European Championships.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in Valencia, Valencian Community, Molina started playing professionally with modest UD Alzira, being purchased in 1991 by local giants Valencia CF. After a loan stint with neighbours Villarreal CF he was sold to Albacete Balompié, making his La Liga debut on 8 January 1995 in a 1–0 home win against Real Oviedo. Even though he conceded eight goals in the last matchday, a home loss against Deportivo de La Coruña, his team managed to escape relegation in the playoffs.

Molina&#x27;s career was intimately related with Atlético Madrid, of which he claimed to be a fan. Signing in 1995, he helped the capital side win a double (league and Copa del Rey) in his first year, going on to miss only two league matches over four seasons.

Joining 2000 league champions Deportivo La Coruña after Atlético&#x27;s relegation, Molina helped win a Spanish cup and two supercups, being an undisputed starter throughout his stint in Galicia. However, on 14 October 2002, he announced that he suffered from testicular cancer, and that he was forced to undergo treatment for his illness, thus missing most of the 2002–03 campaign (ten league appearances, as &quot;Depor&quot; finished third); he eventually recovered fully.

After his link expired, Molina returned home to Valencia for 2006–07, playing for top-division strugglers Levante UD, but did not renew his contract after the season&#x27;s end, retiring subsequently after the club retained its league status.

===International===
Molina made his Spain national team debut as an outfield player against Norway on 24 April 1996 – a cameo appearance as a left winger, as all replacements had been made by coach Javier Clemente and Juan Manuel López retired injured.

He was then included in the squads for UEFA Euro 1996 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but had to wait until Euro 2000 for first-choice status, although he was dropped after a blunder in the opening 1–0 loss to Norway and did not play afterwards.

==Coaching career==
In the 2009–10 campaign, Molina started a coaching career with Villarreal C of Tercera División. On 12 May 2011, he replaced the fired Javi Gracia at the helm of the reserves in the Segunda División as the team was seriously threatened with relegation.

Molina reached Villarreal&#x27;s main squad on 22 December 2011, taking the place of sacked Juan Carlos Garrido. He was himself dismissed on 18 March of the following year after a 1–0 away loss against former club Levante, with the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; dangerously close to the relegation zone (17th).

In 2014, after leading Getafe CF B to the 14th place in the Segunda División B, Molina was appointed at Hong Kong&#x27;s Kitchee SC. In his only season he managed win the domestic treble, also taking the team to the quarter-finals of the AFC Cup.

On 3 May 2016, Molina was announced as the head coach of Indian Super League side ATK, replacing countryman Antonio López Habas. On 14 November of the following year, he was appointed at Ascenso MX club Atlético San Luis ahead of the Clausura tournament. He was relieved of his duties by the latter on 18 February 2018 after just two wins in 11 matches in all competitions, with his side in last position in the league.

In July 2018, Molina was appointed as sporting director of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, replacing Fernando Hierro who had resigned in the aftermath of Spain&#x27;s performance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In December 2022, he left his position following a last-16 elimination at the 2022 World Cup at the hands of Morocco.

Molina signed as manager of Indian top-tier Mohun Bagan Super Giant on 11 June 2024, again taking over from López Habas.

<text>Hopwas is a village in Staffordshire, England. It lies along the North West borders of Tamworth Borough (along the River Tame to the east and Dunstall Lane to the south of Hopwas) and east of Lichfield. It is situated where the A51 road crosses both the River Tame and the Coventry Canal. Although adjacent to the Borough of Tamworth, the village is part of the parish of Wigginton and Hopwas within Lichfield District.

==History==
Hopwas is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as follows: &quot;The King holds Opewas; there are three hides; the arable land is six carucates. In demesne there is a mill of thirteen shillings and four pence rent; and eleven villeins and two bordars employ five ploughs. Here are thirty acres of meadow, a wood six furlongs in length and three in breadth. The whole was valued aforetime and then at 40s.&quot;

==Amenities==

North of Hopwas village is Hopwas Hays Wood, which consists of approximately 385 acres of ancient woodland, that was owned for many years by the Levett family of Wychnor Park. A large part of the woodland is currently owned by Tarmac.

Tamworth Cricket and Hockey Club is based on Hints Road in Hopwas, where it also has a squash section.

The village has a variety of clubs and societies including an active women&#x27;s institute and book club.

Hopwas is served by Arriva bus servies 765 and X65 connecting to Lichfield and Tamworth.

==Historic buildings==
Hopwas has a number of listed buildings, including cottages, a school house and the Parish Church of St Chad. Of particular interest may be the canal bridge, a milepost, and the Hopwas Pumping Station.

Hopwas also possesses two historic public houses, the &quot;Red Lion&quot; and the &quot;Tame Otter&quot; (formerly the &quot;Chequers&quot;).

Lichfield transmitting station, also known as Hopwas Mast, is nearby.

<doc id="974163" wikidata="Q3298443" url="?curid=974163" title="Backstaff">
<text>The backstaff is a navigational instrument that was used to measure the altitude of a celestial body, in particular the Sun or Moon. When observing the Sun, users kept the Sun to their back (hence the name) and observed the shadow cast by the upper vane on a horizon vane. It was invented by the English navigator John Davis, who described it in his book &quot;Seaman&#x27;s Secrets&quot; in 1594.

==Types of backstaffs==
Backstaff is the name given to any instrument that measures the altitude of the sun by the projection of a shadow. It appears that the idea for measuring the sun&#x27;s altitude using back observations originated with Thomas Harriot. Many types of instruments evolved from the cross-staff that can be classified as backstaffs. Only the Davis quadrant remains dominant in the history of navigation instruments. Indeed, the Davis quadrant is essentially synonymous with backstaff. However, Davis was neither the first nor the last to design such an instrument and others are considered here as well.

==Davis quadrant==

Captain John Davis invented a version of the backstaff in 1594. Davis was a navigator who was quite familiar with the instruments of the day such as the mariner&#x27;s astrolabe, the quadrant and the cross-staff. He recognized the inherent drawbacks of each and endeavoured to create a new instrument that could reduce those problems and increase the ease and accuracy of obtaining solar elevations.

One early version of the quadrant staff is shown in &quot;Figure 1&quot;. It had an arc affixed to a staff so that it could slide along the staff (the shape is not critical, though the curved shape was chosen). The arc (A) was placed so that it would cast its shadow on the &quot;horizon vane&quot; (B). The navigator would look along the staff and observe the horizon through a slit in the horizon vane. By sliding the arc so that the shadow aligned with the horizon, the angle of the sun could be read on the graduated staff. This was a simple quadrant, but it was not as accurate as one might like. The accuracy in the instrument is dependent on the length of the staff, but a long staff made the instrument more unwieldy. The maximum altitude that could be measured with this instrument was 45°.

The next version of his quadrant is shown in &quot;Figure 2&quot;. The arc on the top of the instrument in the previous version was replaced with a &quot;shadow vane&quot; placed on a transom. This transom could be moved along a graduated scale to indicate the angle of the shadow above the staff. Below the staff, a 30° arc was added. The horizon, seen through the &quot;horizon vane&quot; on the left, is aligned with the shadow. The &quot;sighting vane&quot; on the arc is moved until it aligns with the view of the horizon. The angle measured is the sum of the angle indicated by the position of the transom and the angle measured on the scale on the arc.

The instrument that is now identified with Davis is shown in &quot;Figure 3&quot;. This form evolved by the mid-17th century. The quadrant arc has been split into two parts. The smaller radius arc, with a span of 60°, was mounted above the staff. The longer radius arc, with a span of 30° was mounted below. Both arcs have a common centre. At the common centre, a slotted &quot;horizon vane&quot; was mounted (B). A moveable &quot;shadow vane&quot; was placed on the upper arc so that its shadow was cast on the horizon vane. A moveable &quot;sight vane&quot; was mounted on the lower arc (C).

It is easier for a person to place a vane at a specific location than to read the arc at an arbitrary position. This is due to Vernier acuity, the ability of a person to align two line segments accurately. Thus an arc with a small radius, marked with relatively few graduations, can be used to place the shadow vane accurately at a specific angle. On the other hand, moving the sight vane to the location where the line to the horizon meets the shadow requires a large arc. This is because the position may be at a fraction of a degree and a large arc allows one to read smaller graduations with greater accuracy. The large arc of the instrument, in later years, was marked with transversals to allow the arc to be read to greater accuracy than the main graduations allow.

Thus Davis was able to optimize the construction of the quadrant to have both a small and a large arc, allowing the effective accuracy of a single arc quadrant of large radius without making the entire instrument so large. This form of the instrument became synonymous with the backstaff. It was one of the most widely used forms of the backstaff. Continental European navigators called it the English Quadrant.

A later modification of the Davis quadrant was to use a &quot;Flamsteed glass&quot; in place of the shadow vane; this was suggested by John Flamsteed. This placed a lens on the vane that projected an image of the sun on the horizon vane instead of a shadow. It was useful under conditions where the sky was hazy or lightly overcast; the dim image of the sun was shown more brightly on the horizon vane where a shadow could not be seen.
===Usage===

In order to use the instrument, the navigator would place the shadow vane at a location anticipating the altitude of the sun. Holding the instrument in front of him, with the sun at his back, he holds the instrument so that the shadow cast by the shadow vane falls on the horizon vane at the side of the slit. He then moves the sight vane so that he observes the horizon in a line from the sight vane through the horizon vane&#x27;s slit while simultaneously maintaining the position of the shadow. This permits him to measure the angle between the horizon and the sun as the sum of the angle read from the two arcs.

Since the shadow&#x27;s edge represents the of the sun, he must correct the value for the semidiameter of the sun.

===Instruments that derived from the Davis quadrant===
The Elton&#x27;s quadrant derived from the Davis quadrant. It added an index arm with spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon.

==Demi-cross==

The demi-cross was an instrument that was contemporary with the Davis quadrant. It was popular outside England.

The vertical transom was like a half-transom on a cross-staff, hence the name &quot;demi-cross&quot;. It supported a &quot;shadow vane&quot; (A in &quot;Figure 4&quot;) that could be set to one of several heights (three according to May, four according to de Hilster). By setting the shadow vane height, the range of angles that could be measured was set. The transom could be slid along the staff and the angle read from one of the graduated scales on the staff.

The &quot;sight vane&quot; (C) and &quot;horizon vane&quot; (B) were aligned visually with the horizon. With the shadow vane&#x27;s shadow cast on the horizon vane and aligned with the horizon, the angle was determined. In practice, the instrument was accurate but more unwieldy than the Davis quadrant.

==Plough==

The plough was the name given to an unusual instrument that existed for a short time. It was part cross-staff and part backstaff. In &quot;Figure 5&quot;, &quot;A&quot; is the transom that casts its shadow on the horizon vane at &quot;B&quot;. It functions in the same manner as the staff in &quot;Figure 1&quot;. &quot;C&quot; is the sighting vane. The navigator uses the sighting vane and the horizon vane to align the instrument horizontally. The sighting vane can be moved left to right along the staff. &quot;D&quot; is a transom just as one finds on a cross-staff. This transom has two vanes on it that can be moved closer or farther from the staff to emulate different-length transoms. The transom can be moved on the staff and used to measure angles.

==Almucantar staff==

The Almucantar staff is a device specifically used for measuring the altitude of the sun at low altitudes.

==Cross-staff==

The cross-staff was normally a direct observation instrument. However, in later years it was modified for use with back observations.

==Quadrant==

There was a variation of the quadrant – the Back observation quadrant – that was used for measuring the sun&#x27;s altitude by observing the shadow cast on a horizon vane.

==Thomas Hood cross-staff==

Thomas Hood invented this cross-staff in 1590. It could be used for surveying, astronomy or other geometric problems.

It consists of two components, a transom and a yard. The transom is the vertical component and is graduated from 0° at the top to 45° at the bottom. At the top of the transom, a vane is mounted to cast a shadow. The yard is horizontal and is graduated from 45° to 90°. The transom and yard are joined by a special fitting (the &quot;double socket&quot; in &quot;Figure 6&quot;) that permits independent adjustments of the transom vertically and the yard horizontally.

It was possible to construct the instrument with the yard at the top of the transom rather than at the bottom.

Initially, the transom and yard are set so that the two are joined at their respective 45° settings. The instrument is held so that the yard is horizontal (the navigator can view the horizon along the yard to assist in this). The socket is loosened so that the transom is moved vertically until the shadow of the vane is cast at the yard&#x27;s 90° setting. If the movement of just the transom can accomplish this, the altitude is given by the transom&#x27;s graduations. If the sun is too high for this, the yard horizontal opening in the socket is loosened and the yard is moved to allow the shadow to land on the 90° mark. The yard then yields the altitude.

It was a fairly accurate instrument, as the graduations were well spaced compared to a conventional cross-staff. However, it was a bit unwieldy and difficult to handle in wind.

==Benjamin Cole quadrant==
A late addition to the collection of backstaves in the navigation world, this device was invented by Benjamin Cole in 1748.

The instrument consists of a staff with a pivoting quadrant on one end. The quadrant has a &quot;shadow vane&quot;, which can optionally take a lens like the Davis quadrant&#x27;s Flamsteed glass, at the upper end of the graduated scale (A in &quot;Figure 7&quot;). This casts a shadow or projects an image of the sun on the &quot;horizon vane&quot; (B). The observer views the horizon through a hole in the &quot;sight vane&quot; (D) and a slit in the horizon vane to ensure the instrument is level. The quadrant component is rotated until the horizon and the sun&#x27;s image or shadow are aligned. The altitude can then be read from the quadrant&#x27;s scale. In order to refine the reading, a circular vernier is mounted on the staff (C).

The fact that such an instrument was introduced in the middle of the 18th century shows that the quadrant was still a viable instrument even in the presence of the octant.

English scientist George Adams created a very similar backstaff at the same time. Adam&#x27;s version ensured that the distance between the Flamsteed glass and horizon vane was the same as the distance from the vane to the sight vane.

==Cross bow quadrant==

Edmund Gunter invented the cross bow quadrant, also called the mariner&#x27;s bow, around 1623. It gets its name from the similarity to the archer&#x27;s crossbow.

This instrument is interesting in that the arc is 120° but is only graduated as a 90° arc. As such, the angular spacing of a degree on the arc is slightly greater than one degree. Examples of the instrument can be found with a 0° to 90° graduation or with two mirrored 0° to 45° segments centred on the midpoint of the arc.

The instrument has three vanes, a &quot;horizon vane&quot; (A in &quot;Figure 8&quot;) which has an opening in it to observe the horizon, a &quot;shadow vane&quot; (B) to cast a shadow on the horizon vane and a &quot;sighting vane&quot; (C) that the navigator uses to view the horizon and shadow at the horizon vane. This serves to ensure the instrument is level while simultaneously measuring the altitude of the sun. The altitude is the difference in the angular positions of the shadow and sighting vanes.

With some versions of this instrument, the sun&#x27;s declination for each day of the year was marked on the arc. This permitted the navigator to set the shadow vane to the date and the instrument would read the altitude directly.

<text>Kathryn Apanowicz ( ; born 3 June 1960) is a British actress and presenter. Apanowicz grew up in Horsforth, Leeds, with a brother, Stephen. Her father was a Polish RAF pilot in the Second World War. She first became involved with television at the age of eleven when she presented a junior-aimed programme on ITV, before joining &quot;Calendar&quot; and then turning to acting.

Apanowicz is best known for her 1980s television appearances in the BBC soap operas &quot;Angels&quot;, In which she played Nurse Rose Butchins, and &quot;EastEnders&quot;, in which she played the caterer Magda Czajkowski. She has also had minor roles in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and, as a child, appeared in the film &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;. Before being cast in these shows, Apanowicz had worked in children&#x27;s programmes for Yorkshire Television with Mark Curry.

In the early 1990s, she worked at cable channel Wire TV and launched the channel on 4 May 1992. She presented its talk-based magazine programme &quot;Afternoon Live&quot;. 

In 2000, she enjoyed a regular stint as one of the presenters of ITV&#x27;s daytime magazine show for women, &quot;Live Talk&quot;. She is both a presenter for BBC Radio Leeds, and a guest presenter for BBC Radio York.

From 1994 to 2005, Apanowicz was the partner of &quot;Countdown&quot; host Richard Whiteley. Whiteley died on 26 June 2005 aged 61 after a failed emergency operation due to endocartitis. After his death, she published a biography of Whiteley titled &quot;Richard by Kathryn&quot;. Apanowicz donated three pairs of Whiteley&#x27;s spectacles to optical charity Vision Aid Overseas (VAO), who sent them with a team of optical professionals to Ethiopia, where they were fitted to three locals with the same prescription. The BBC followed this story on their &quot;Inside Out&quot; programme which was broadcast on 19 September 2007.

Apanowicz became friends with Whiteley&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; co-host Carol Vorderman. In July 2008, Apanowicz made numerous appearances in the British media lambasting Channel 4 bosses for their refusal to negotiate an acceptable pay deal with Vorderman, which had resulted in her departure from the show.

<doc id="974169" wikidata="Q746863" url="?curid=974169" title="Algebraic function">
<text>In mathematics, an algebraic function is a function that can be defined 
as the root of an irreducible polynomial equation. Algebraic functions are often algebraic expressions using a finite number of terms, involving only the algebraic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power. Examples of such functions are:
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3

Some algebraic functions, however, cannot be expressed by such finite expressions (this is the Abel–Ruffini theorem). This is the case, for example, for the Bring radical, which is the function implicitly defined by

: formula_4.

In more precise terms, an algebraic function of degree in one variable is a function formula_5 that is continuous in its domain and satisfies a polynomial equation of positive degree

: formula_6

where the coefficients are polynomial functions of , with integer coefficients. It can be shown that the same class of functions is obtained if algebraic numbers are accepted for the coefficients of the &#x27;s. If transcendental numbers occur in the coefficients the function is, in general, not algebraic, but it is &quot;algebraic over the field&quot; generated by these coefficients.

The value of an algebraic function at a rational number, and more generally, at an algebraic number is always an algebraic number.
Sometimes, coefficients formula_7 that are polynomial over a ring are considered, and one then talks about &quot;functions algebraic over &quot;.

A function which is not algebraic is called a transcendental function, as it is for example the case of formula_8. A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function: formula_9.

As a polynomial equation of degree &quot;n&quot; has up to &quot;n&quot; roots (and exactly &quot;n&quot; roots over an algebraically closed field, such as the complex numbers), a polynomial equation does not implicitly define a single function, but up to &quot;n&quot;
functions, sometimes also called branches. Consider for example the equation of the unit circle:
formula_10
This determines &quot;y&quot;, except only up to an overall sign; accordingly, it has two branches:
formula_11

An algebraic function in &quot;m&quot; variables is similarly defined as a function formula_12 which solves a polynomial equation in &quot;m&quot; + 1 variables:

:formula_13

It is normally assumed that &quot;p&quot; should be an irreducible polynomial. The existence of an algebraic function is then guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.

Formally, an algebraic function in &quot;m&quot; variables over the field &quot;K&quot; is an element of the algebraic closure of the field of rational functions &quot;K&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;).

== Algebraic functions in one variable ==
=== Introduction and overview ===
The informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties. To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual algebraic operations: addition, multiplication, division, and taking an &quot;n&quot;th root. This is something of an oversimplification; because of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals.

First, note that any polynomial function formula_14 is an algebraic function, since it is simply the solution &quot;y&quot; to the equation

:formula_15

More generally, any rational function formula_16 is algebraic, being the solution to

:formula_17

Moreover, the &quot;n&quot;th root of any polynomial formula_18 is an algebraic function, solving the equation

:formula_19

Surprisingly, the inverse function of an algebraic function is an algebraic function. For supposing that &quot;y&quot; is a solution to

:formula_20

for each value of &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; is also a solution of this equation for each value of &quot;y&quot;. Indeed, interchanging the roles of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and gathering terms,

:formula_21

Writing &quot;x&quot; as a function of &quot;y&quot; gives the inverse function, also an algebraic function.

However, not every function has an inverse. For example, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2 fails the horizontal line test: it fails to be one-to-one. The inverse is the algebraic &quot;function&quot; formula_22. 
Another way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an algebraic curve.

=== The role of complex numbers ===
From an algebraic perspective, complex numbers enter quite naturally into the study of algebraic functions. First of all, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, the complex numbers are an algebraically closed field. Hence any polynomial relation &quot;p&quot;(&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) = 0 is guaranteed to have at least one solution (and in general a number of solutions not exceeding the degree of &quot;p&quot; in &quot;y&quot;) for &quot;y&quot; at each point &quot;x&quot;, provided we allow &quot;y&quot; to assume complex as well as real values. Thus, problems to do with the domain of an algebraic function can safely be minimized.
Furthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking &quot;nth&quot; roots without resorting to complex numbers (see casus irreducibilis). For example, consider the algebraic function determined by the equation

:formula_23

Using the cubic formula, we get

:formula_24

For formula_25 the square root is real and the cubic root is thus well defined, providing the unique real root. On the other hand, for formula_26 the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non-real square root. Thus the cubic root has to be chosen among three non-real numbers. If the same choices are done in the two terms of the formula, the three choices for the cubic root provide the three branches shown, in the accompanying image.

It may be proven that there is no way to express this function in terms of &quot;nth&quot; roots using real numbers only, even though the resulting function is real-valued on the domain of the graph shown.

On a more significant theoretical level, using complex numbers allows one to use the powerful techniques of complex analysis to discuss algebraic functions. In particular, the argument principle can be used to show that any algebraic function is in fact an analytic function, at least in the multiple-valued sense.

Formally, let &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) be a complex polynomial in the complex variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Suppose that
&quot;x&quot;0 ∈ C is such that the polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;) of &quot;y&quot; has &quot;n&quot; distinct zeros. We shall show that the algebraic function is analytic in a neighborhood of &quot;x&quot;0. Choose a system of &quot;n&quot; non-overlapping discs Δ&quot;i&quot; containing each of these zeros. Then by the argument principle

:formula_27

By continuity, this also holds for all &quot;x&quot; in a neighborhood of &quot;x&quot;0. In particular, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) has only one root in Δ&quot;i&quot;, given by the residue theorem:

:formula_28

which is an analytic function.

=== Monodromy ===
Note that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of &quot;n&quot; different function elements &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), provided that &quot;x&quot; is not a critical point of &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;). A &quot;critical point&quot; is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of &quot;p&quot;, and this occurs only where the highest degree term of &quot;p&quot; or the discriminant vanish. Hence there are only finitely many such points &quot;c&quot;1, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;m&quot;.

A close analysis of the properties of the function elements &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; near the critical points can be used to show that the monodromy cover is ramified over the critical points (and possibly the point at infinity). Thus the holomorphic extension of the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; has at worst algebraic poles and ordinary algebraic branchings over the critical points.

Note that, away from the critical points, we have

:formula_29

since the &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; are by definition the distinct zeros of &quot;p&quot;. The monodromy group acts by permuting the factors, and thus forms the monodromy representation of the Galois group of &quot;p&quot;. (The monodromy action on the universal covering space is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces.)

== History ==

The ideas surrounding algebraic functions go back at least as far as René Descartes. The first discussion of algebraic functions appears to have been in Edward Waring&#x27;s 1794 &quot;An Essay on the Principles of Human Knowledge&quot; in which he writes:
:let a quantity denoting the ordinate, be an algebraic function of the abscissa &quot;x&quot;, by the common methods of division and extraction of roots, reduce it into an infinite series ascending or descending according to the dimensions of &quot;x&quot;, and then find the integral of each of the resulting terms.

<doc id="974174" wikidata="Q5332713" url="?curid=974174" title="Echo Island">
<text>Echo Island is an Irish television programme for children and young adults, shown on RTÉ Network 2. It was shown at 17:00 during &quot;The Den&quot;, after which programmes like &quot;The Legend of the Hidden City&quot; would air. The show effectively took over from &quot;Jo Maxi&quot;, which had been aimed at the teenaged youth of Ireland.

==Birth==
&quot;Echo Island&quot; began broadcasting in 1994 with two episodes a week. This was extended to four episodes the following year with two of these being Irish language editions. The series ran for six seasons; in later years it proved a useful showcase for some of the best young rock bands in Ireland. Many of the presenters were chosen for their bilingualism, including Dara Ó Briain.

A similar format show called &quot;Stream&quot; replaced it, splitting up each day with a different topic such as Gaming, Sports and other types of activities and did away with &quot;Echo Island&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Make and Do&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; sections. &quot;Stream&quot; did not air as in Irish, because by that stage TG4 was providing an Irish-language children&#x27;s service.

==Presenters==
Many current presenters either began, or spent part of, their early careers on &quot;Echo Island&quot;, including Derek Mooney and Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh, Carrie Crowley, Mary Kingston, Dara Ó Briain and Peter O&#x27;Meara, Danann Breathnach, Sinéad Chaomhánach, Christine Ní Chearraláin, Tom O&#x27;Brannigan and Pádraic Ó Neachtain.

==Format==
Similar in format to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; (but with a desert island setting and design), &quot;Echo Island&quot; featured a resident Moluccan Cockatoo called Rocco, who provided the series with a constant stream of noisy background chatter. Each episode was based around an interview in &quot;The Shack&quot; with an adult guest, who was asked to bring along some items of significance from their childhood. U.S. ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, for instance, appeared on the 15 November 1994 episode to promote a Christmas card competition. President Mary McAleese appeared on the programme on the 19 December 1997 episode, while the Australian didgeridoo player Rolf Harris was a guest on the 13 October 1998 episode.

Competitions, items on art and cookery, fundraising campaigns, the &quot;Echovision Song Contest&quot; for young performers and the &quot;Pet Clinic&quot; where TV Vet, Pete Wedderburn, answered viewers calls about their pets were some of the features. Each Friday edition featured young &quot;stringers&quot; who reported from all around Ireland on events happening in their locality. This item contained an apparently live two-way video link between the presenter in studio and the children on location and was an advanced production technique in its day.

==Since==
* Dara Ó Briain appeared on a number of other RTÉ programmes including &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Feed The Gondolas&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Family Affair&quot;. He has since become one of the best known Irish comedians in the United Kingdom, having appeared on many of the BBC&#x27;s top programmes such as &quot;Mock The Week&quot; and &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;.
* Derek Mooney has since become one of Ireland&#x27;s best known TV and radio presenters. He currently has his week day radio show on RTÉ Radio 1. He presented &quot;Winning Streak&quot; for a number of years. He was then host of RTÉ&#x27;s search for the cast of &quot;&quot; reality TV show.
* Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh has since become one of Ireland&#x27;s best known TV presenters. She presented &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot; on RTÉ One and is a judge on &quot;The All Ireland Talent Show&quot;.

<doc id="974177" wikidata="Q1136243" url="?curid=974177" title="Cinema of Nigeria">
<text>The [[Film|cinema]] of [[Nigeria]], often referred to informally as [[Nollywood]], consists of films produced in Nigeria; its history dates back to as early as the late 19th century and into the colonial era in the early 20th century. The history and development of the Nigerian motion picture industry is sometimes generally classified in four main eras: the Colonial era, Golden Age era, Video film era and the emerging New Nigerian cinema era.

Film as a medium first arrived in Nigeria in the late 19th century, in the form of peephole viewing of motion picture devices. These were soon replaced in the early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices, with the first set of films screened at the Glover Memorial Hall in Lagos from 12 to 22 August 1903. The earliest feature film made in Nigeria is 1926&#x27;s &quot;Palaver&quot; directed by Geoffrey Barkas, which was also the first to feature Nigerian actors in substantial roles. As of 1954, mobile cinema vans played to at least 3.5 million people in Nigeria, and films being produced by the Nigerian Film Unit were screened for free at the 44 available cinemas. The first film entirely copyrighted to the Nigerian Film Unit is &quot;Fincho&quot; (1957) by Sam Zebba; which is also the first Nigerian film to be shot in colour.

After Nigeria&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established. As a result, Nigerian films in theatres increased in the late 1960s into the 1970s, especially productions from Western Nigeria, owing to former theatre practitioners such as Hubert Ogunde and Moses Olaiya transitioning into the big screen. In 1972, the &quot;Indigenization Decree&quot; was issued by Yakubu Gowon, which demands the transfer of ownership of about a total of 300 film theatres from their foreign owners to Nigerians, which resulted in more Nigerians playing active roles in the cinema and film. The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 also contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria, as the increased purchasing power in Nigeria made a wide range of citizens to have disposable income to spend on cinema going and on home television sets. After several moderately-performing films, &quot;Papa Ajasco&quot; (1984) by Wale Adenuga became the first blockbuster, grossing approximately ₦61,000 (approx. ₦21,552,673 in 2015 value) in three days. A year later, &quot;Mosebolatan&quot; (1985) by Moses Olaiya went ahead to gross ₦107,000 (approx. ₦44,180,499 in 2015 value) in five days.

After the decline of the Golden era, Nigerian film industry experienced a second major boom in the 1990s, supposedly marked by the release of the direct-to-video film &quot;Living in Bondage&quot; (1992); the industry peaked in the mid-2000s to become the second largest film industry in the world in terms of the number of annual film productions, placing it ahead of the United States and behind only India. It started dominating screens across the African continent, and by extension the Caribbean and the wider diaspora, with the movies significantly influencing cultures and the film actors becoming household names across the continent. The boom also led to backlash against Nigerian films in several countries, bordering on theories such as the &quot;Nigerialization of Africa&quot;.

Since the mid-2000s, during the decline of the video-film era, the Nigerian cinema has undergone some restructuring to promote quality in output and professionalism in the industry, with &quot;The Figurine&quot; (2009) widely regarded as marking the major turnaround of contemporary Nigerian cinema. There has since been a resurgence in cinema establishments, and a steady return of the cinema culture in Nigeria. As of 2013, Nigerian cinema is rated as the third most valuable film industry in the world based on its worth and revenues generated. with the movies significantly influencing cultures.

==History==
The history of cinema in Nigeria dates back to as early as the history of film itself; notably in the late 19th century, with the use of peephole viewing of motion picture devices. These were soon replaced in early 20th century with improved motion picture exhibition devices; the first set of films shown in Nigerian theatres were Western films, with the first film screened at Glover Memorial Hall in Lagos from 12 to 22 August 1903. In that year, Herbert Macaulay had invited to Nigeria, the &quot;Balboa and Company&quot;, Spain to organize an exhibition tour of silent films in Nigeria.

Although Mr Balboa later closed his exhibition in Lagos, while he continued showing films in other West African countries, the success of his exhibition led to a European merchant, Stanley Jones, to begin showing films in the same Glover Memorial Hall, starting from November 1903. This brought about the influx of more European film exhibitors to Nigeria. The first film hit in this early period came on 3 August 1904, when the documentary on the visit of the &quot;Alake of Egba&quot; to England was screened.

===Colonial era (late 19th century - early 1960s)===

Colonial filmmakers started producing films for local audiences within Nigeria since the 1920s, mostly employing the mobile cinema as a means of exhibition; the earliest feature film made in Nigeria is 1926&#x27;s &quot;Palaver&quot; produced by Geoffrey Barkas. The film was also the first film ever to feature Nigerian actors in a speaking role. Nigerian film actors featured in &quot;Palaver&quot; include Dawiya and Yilkuba. The film was shot amongst the Sura and Angas people of the present day Bauchi and Plateau States in Northern Nigeria, and narrates the rivalry between a British District Officer and a tin miner which leads to a war. Also in this era there were several films set in Nigeria, one of the most notable being 1935&#x27;s &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; by Zoltán Korda, featuring Nigerian actor Orlando Martins. Martins also featured in other notable films including &quot;The Man from Morocco&quot; (1945), &quot;Men of Two Worlds&quot; (1946) and so on, and this established Martins as one of the recognized Nigerian actors of his time. As of 1921, there were four other halls showing films twice a week in Lagos Mainland and one hall each in Ebute Metta and Oshodi. By this time, cinema had become popular in Lagos with crowds of young and old people usually waiting at the doors of theatre halls. Religion also aided in the expansion of cinema culture as the Christian missionaries used cinemas for religious propaganda.

As cinemas became a common feature of the social life in the then emerging city of Lagos, the late 1930s through 1940s marked the beginning of the establishment of big commercial cinema houses with branches in strategic parts of the country. One of the earliest cinema operators in Lagos was the &quot;West African Pictures Company&quot; owned by Mr. S. Khalil, a member of the Syrian community in Lagos. He established the Rex Cinema in Ebute Metta, Regal Cinema and Royal Cinema. Other popular cinema chains include: Capitol Cinema, Casino Cinema, Kings Cinema, Central Cinema, Rialto Cinema, Corona Cinema, Odeon Cinema, Road House Cinema, Ikeja Arms Cinema and Glover Hall. In 1937, the colonial government set up a Board of Censorship to handle matters relating to the establishment and operations of cinema houses in the colony. Nigerian content in films made and shown in Nigerian cinemas during this period were however virtually non-existent as the production and distribution were controlled by foreigners. Motion picture entertainment was as a result complemented by the Yoruba travel theatre groups, which emerged in the 1930s through 1940s; One of the most prominent were the Agbegijo and Alarinjo theatre groups, which featured theatre actors such as Duro Ladipo, Ishola Ogunmola, Lere Paimo, Oyin Adejobi, amongst others.

In 1949 through 1950, the state of affairs changed a bit, with more Nigerian contents being exhibited in cinemas; with a purported drive to &quot;Africanize&quot; film production, the Nigerian Film Unit was established in order to decentralize colonial film production. The Colonial Film Unit, throughout the decade, exhibited health and educational films to local audiences through its mobile cinema vans. It also produced newsreels and short documentaries, depicting celebrations and colonial achievements to domestic and overseas audiences.

===Golden Age (late 1950s - late 1980s)===

After Nigeria&#x27;s independence from Britain in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established. However, there came a significant influx of American, Indian, Chinese and Japanese films; posters of films from these countries were all over theatre halls and actors from these industries became very popular in Nigeria. Towards the late 1960s and into the 1970s Nigerian productions in movie houses increased gradually, especially productions from Western Nigeria, owing to former theatre practitioners such as Hubert Ogunde, Ola Balogun, Moses Olaiya, Jab Adu, Isola Ogunsola, Ladi Ladebo, Sanya Dosumu and Sadiq Balewa amongst others, transitioning into the big screen. The first fully commercial Nigerian films, shot on celluloid, were also made by these filmmakers in the 1960s.

In 1972, concerned about the influx of foreign culture into Nigeria, the &quot;Indigenization Decree&quot; was issued by the then head of state Yakubu Gowon; which demands the transfer of ownership of about a total of 300 film theatres in the country from their foreign owners to Nigerians. Also, more Nigerians started playing active roles in cinema establishment as a result of this policy. This transfer also resulted in the emergence of Nigerian playwrights, screenwriters and film producers; popular literature and theatre works were adapted into motion pictures. The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria. The presence of foreign investments led to the erection of several cinema complexes. In 1976, The 5000-capacity National Arts Theatre, Iganmu was constructed in Lagos. The theatre was incorporated with two cinemas, each having a capacity of over 700 people. At this time cinema business had become a notable employer of many people and also served as an important social function, as Nigerians visited cinemas for relaxation and entertainment purposes. The increased purchasing power in Nigeria also made a wide range of citizens to have disposable income to spend on cinema-going and on home television sets.

Television broadcasting in Nigeria began in the 1960s and received much government support in its early years. By the mid-1980s every state had its own broadcasting station. Law limited foreign content on television, so producers in Lagos began televising local popular theatre productions. Many of these were circulated on video as well, and a small-scale informal video movie trade developed. As of late 1980s, the cinema culture was beginning to face a major decline, and most Nigerian film producers had transitioned to television productions. The gradual decline of the Golden era of Nigerian cinema has been attributed to several factors, including the reduction in the value of Naira, lack of finance and marketing support, lack of standard film studios and production equipment, frequent Government structural adjustment programmes due to military dictatorships, as well as inexperience on the part of practitioners. The drastic decline in cinema culture resulted in some of the existing cinema houses being acquired by religious bodies and turned to churches; others were simply just closed down. In the early 1990s, only a few of the once vibrant cinema houses were still in operation, and all had collapsed before 1999.

===Home Video Boom (late 1980s - mid 2010s)===

The emergence of the video film market in Nigeria is traced back to the 1980s when television productions thrived. Jimi Odumosu&#x27;s &quot;Evil Encounter&quot;, a 1983 horror film released directly on television, was the first production to be a pointer to how lucrative making film directly on video could be. The film was extensively promoted before being aired on television, and as a result, had streets flooded in the following morning with video copies of the recorded broadcast. It was reported that the film became an instant hit at Alaba market, a commercial district which later became the hub of video distribution in this period and also eventually became the hub of piracy in Nigeria. Since &quot;Evil Encounter&quot;, it became common, especially in Southern Nigerian cities, to see video copies of recorded television programmes traded on the streets.

This method was adopted and built on by producers and distributors at Alaba Market to reinvent the film industry, since the Nigerian cinema culture was facing a major decline. The first film produced on video in Nigeria was 1988&#x27;s &quot;Soso Meji&quot;, produced by Ade Ajiboye. The film was also screened at the few available theatres at the time. Subsequently, Alade Aromire produced &quot;Ekun&quot; (1989) on video, which was screened at the National Theatre, Iganmu. However, the boom experienced in this era is generally believed to have been kickstarted by Kenneth Nnebue&#x27;s &quot;Living in Bondage&quot; (1992). Nnebue had an excess number of imported video cassettes which he then used to shoot his first film on a Video camera. Although &quot;Living in Bondage&quot; is often touted in the media as the &quot;first commercial video film&quot;, several historians have argued that the video film industry was already booming before &quot;Living in Bondage&quot;.

As of 2004, at least four to five films were produced every day in Nigeria. Nigerian movies had also already dominated television screens across the African continent and by extension, the diaspora. The film actors also became household names across the continent, and the movies significantly influenced cultures in many African nations; from ways of dressing to speech and usage of Nigerian slangs. This was attributed to the fact that Nigerian films told &quot;relatable&quot; stories, which made foreign films to &quot;gather dust&quot; on the shelves of video stores, even though they cost much less.

According to the &quot;Filmmakers Cooperative of Nigeria&quot;, every film in Nigeria had a potential audience of 15 million people in Nigeria and about 5 million outside Nigeria. In no time, the industry became the third largest producer of films in the world. However, this didn&#x27;t translate to an overtly commercial film industry when compared to other major film hubs across the world; the worth of the industry was approximated at just about US$250 million, since most of the films produced were cheaply made. The film industry regardless became a major employer in Nigeria. As of 2007, with a total number of 6,841 registered video parlours and an estimated 500,000 unregistered ones, the estimated revenue generated by sales and rentals of movies in Lagos State alone was estimated to be ₦804 million (US$5 million) per week, which adds up to an estimated ₦33.5 billion (US$209 million) revenue for Lagos State per annum. Approximately 700,000 discs were sold in Alaba market per day, with the total sales revenue generated by the film industry in Nigeria estimated at ₦522 billion (US$3 billion) per annum, with broadcast content valued at ₦250 billion (US$1.6 billion).

At the peak of the video era at around 2008, the industry had become the second largest producer of films, releasing approximately 200 video films monthly. However at this point, the Nigerian film industry had practically degenerated into a &quot;visionless&quot; industry, with the invasion of several people who did not know a thing about filmmaking, and piracy was at its peak. Dealing with the menace of piracy, amongst other problems, became a hard nut to crack; as a result of this, most investors of the &quot;Alaba cartel&quot;, who control almost 90 percent stakes in the video industry, began to channel their money into other business ventures instead. The decline of the home video era has been attributed to several factors, such as the refusal of the Government to provide support and funding, the lack of a formal and effective indigenous film distribution infrastructure and the increase in the cost of production in Nigeria.

===New Nigerian Cinema (mid 2000s - present)===
This is an emerging phase in Nigerian cinema, in which there became a major shift in the method of film production, from the video format, back to the cinema method, which constituted the films produced in the Golden era. A few years into the 21st century, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which was initially structured for the middle and upper classes. The Silverbird Group is the first company to launch a series of modern cinema houses across major cities in Nigeria, mostly situated in affluent areas and districts. It launched its cinema chains in 2004, starting with the Silverbird Galleria in Victoria Island, Lagos. The Silverbird Galleria is a large shopping mall, with an upscale cinema facility and various outlets where mercantile activities take place. This provides more reasons to visit the place beyond just watching films, but more of a social activity and a modified sort of entertainment beyond film watching. This trend has given another probable explanation as to the demise of the Nigerian cinema culture in the 1980s, which might have been as a result of the unfashionable appearance of most cinemas of the Golden era.

Silverbird cinemas upon establishment started screening Nigerian films with high production quality, as a result discouraging poor film production. The first New wave film to be shown at a cinema was the Yoruba-language film &quot;Irapada&quot; (2006) by Kunle Afolayan, which was screened at the Silverbird Galleria in Lagos. The Silverbird experiment became very successful, and as a result, the group launched a few more cinema branches in Lagos and other cities in the country. Not long after the establishment of Silverbird cinemas, Genesis Deluxe Cinemas and Ozone Cinemas were also launched creating a competition in the cinema business. Much later, in the 2010s, Filmhouse Cinemas also came into the picture, leading to the availability of more cinemas in the country, especially outside the affluent neighbourhoods.

Several grants have been launched by the Nigerian Government, in order to support quality content in Nigerian films. In 2006, &quot;Project Nollywood&quot; was launched by the Nigerian Government, in conjunction with Ecobank. The project provided ₦100 million (US$781,000) to Nigerian filmmakers to produce high quality films and to fund a multimillion Naira distribution network across the country during this period. In 2010, the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan launched a ₦30 billion (US$200 million) &quot;Creative and Entertainment Industry&quot; Intervention Fund, financed by Bank of Industry (BOI), in conjunction with Nigerian Export and Import (NEXIM) Bank. This grant, although dubbed as a spin-off of &quot;Project Nollywood&quot;, was for the entire Nigerian Creative Arts and Entertainment sector. The vision of the grant for the film industry however is to help more Nigerian filmmakers in training, funding, and also help in creating necessary infrastructure for the industry. In 2013, a smaller new grant of ₦3 billion (US$20 million) was awarded once again solely for Nollywood, and specifically for the production of high quality films, and to sponsor filmmakers for formal training in film schools. Also in 2015, Bank of Industry launched another &quot;NollyFund&quot; program for the purpose of giving financial support in form of loans to film producers.

The popular 2009 thriller film &quot;The Figurine&quot; is generally considered the game changer, which heightened the media attention towards the &quot;New Nigerian Cinema&quot; revolution. The film was a critical and commercial success in Nigeria, and it was also screened in international film festivals The 2010 film &quot;Ijé&quot; by Chineze Anyaene, overtook &quot;The Figurine&quot; to become the highest grossing Nigerian film; a record it held for four years, until it was overtaken in 2014 by &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; (2013). By 2016, this record was held by &quot;The Wedding Party&quot;, a film by Kemi Adetiba.

By the end of 2013, the film industry reportedly hit a record breaking revenue of ₦1.72 trillion (US$11 billion). As of 2014, the industry was worth ₦853.9 billion (US$5.1 billion) making it the third most valuable film industry in the world, behind the United States and India. It contributed about 1.4% to Nigeria&#x27;s economy; this was attributed to the increase in the number of quality films produced and more formal distribution methods.

Unlike the home video era, films in the new wave are generally of much improved quality, with considerably bigger budgets; averaging between ₦40 million (US$250,000) and ₦120 million ($750,000). These films&#x27; production periods take months and even span into years, a far cry from the films in video format which are usually shot in a matter of days or weeks. Other notable improvements in the New Nollywood include: more subtle performances from actors; different from the overt melodrama which constituted the video era, more practical, more logical and generally better stories. Themes explored in these films are often characterized by consciously cosmopolitan themes, as most of the filmmakers are relatively young. A proper copyright and distribution system still remains one of the major challenges in the New Nigerian Cinema.

In the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, the Nigerian film &quot;Mami Wata&quot; won the Special Jury Award for Cinematography.

The animated short film &quot;Morèmi&quot; by Lagosian Shof Coker was included in the anthology &quot;Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire&quot; by Disney+ in 2023. &quot;Morèmi&quot; follows the ghost boy Luo, who is trapped in the realm of the gods and haunted by giants. When he is rescued by a scientist from future Nigeria, Luo connects with his lost memories and learns of the sacrifice once made to save his people.

&quot;Battle on Buka Street&quot; from 2022 takes a humorous yet dramatic approach to the rivalry between two not-so-young sisters who vie for the distinction of being the best outdoor chef and hawker in their (fictional) street when it comes to culinary delights. The comedy has since surpassed Wedding Party I and II, is (as of August 2023) the highest-grossing Nigerian film of all time, and has received critical acclaim. This is the first Nigerian non-arthouse film to screen in US box offices. According to Film One Entertainment, the lead film studio, &quot;Battle&quot; is the first ever film of its kind in the US. Its controlled release in 11 Regal theatres with reduced screenings resulted in sold-out screenings nationwide. Film One adds that it is the first ever indigenous Nollywood release in the United States. &quot;Buka&quot; are (in Yoruba and Hausa) gastronomic street vendors.

==Influx of Ghanaian actors==
Around year 2006 through 2007, Nigerian filmmaker Frank Rajah Arase signed a contract with a Ghanaian production company, &quot;Venus Films&quot;, which involved helping to introduce Ghanaian actors into mainstream Nollywood. This collaboration eventually led to extreme popularity of certain Ghanaian actors, such as Van Vicker, Jackie Appiah, Majid Michel, Yvonne Nelson, John Dumelo, Nadia Buari and Yvonne Okoro, arguably as much as their Nigerian counterparts. Furthermore, over the years; due to the high cost of film production in Nigeria, Nigerian filmmakers have been forced to make films outside Lagos in order to cut costs, mirroring the exodus of filmmaking in Hollywood from Los Angeles to cities like Toronto and Albuquerque, a process known as &quot;Runaway production&quot;. Several other producers as a result started shooting in cities like Accra, Ghana, channeling the savings into investing in better equipment, many of them trying to get their films onto the big screen.

In 2013, Nigerian Entertainment Today revealed that Ghanaian actors had 60 percent of the total market share in the year. A survey carried out by the Newspaper showed that out of 184 films featured on &quot;Nollytuned.com&quot;, a Nigerian streaming website, between April and August 2013, Ghanaian actors played lead roles in at least 93 of them. It was also reported that there are high demands for Ghanaian acts in video stores. At the first edition of Africa Magic Viewers&#x27; Choice Awards (AMVCA) in 2013, Ghana&#x27;s Jackie Appiah was awarded &quot;Best Actress in a Lead Role&quot;. Same year, Appiah again was awarded &#x27;Best Actress&#x27; at the Nollywood and African Film Critics Awards (NAFCA). Ghanaian actors like Majid Michel have also been awarded at several Nollywood award ceremonies.

Sam Onanuga, a Nigerian script writer blames the trend on the reluctance of the established Nigerian acts to partake in more films on Video. With the emergence of New Nigerian Cinema, more Nigerian acts wanted roles on the big screen in order to boost their resume, refusing to star in video films; Ghanaian actors as a result took advantage of this, as they become more prominent on Nigerian video films which were already taking a down turn at this time, but still very popular.
This development sparked media attention; mostly concerns that Ghanaians were taking over jobs meant for Nigerians. While some industry stakeholders such as Bob Manuel were unwelcoming towards the development, others like Mercy Aigbe, Belinda Effah, and Yvonne Jegede saw it as a welcome development; noting that the industry is big enough for everyone, and that other major film hubs across the world also have presence of other nationalities. Theresa Edem commented: &quot;A united Africa sells any day, anytime. It&#x27;s been a great partnership so far. They&#x27;ve added colour to Nollywood and they&#x27;ve brought about healthy competition. Emem Isong, a Nigerian producer comments: &quot;It fosters unity and integration and that&#x27;s not a bad thing&quot;.

Some Ghanaian media on the other hand described the trend as &quot;Brain drain&quot; from Ghana. However, Ghanaian director Frank Fiifi Gharbin, expressed satisfaction with the development, saying: &quot;there shouldn&#x27;t be much fuss about Ghanaian actors in Nollywood. For us it is a good development. It shows that our actors are beginning to gain prominence and are being accepted worldwide&quot;.

==Influence==
The increased collaboration between Nigeria and Ghana from the mid-2000s led to the resurgence of Ghana&#x27;s film industry. However, many Ghanaian productions are copyrighted to Nollywood and distributed by Nigerian marketers due to Nigeria&#x27;s bigger market. Nigerian filmmakers usually feature Ghanaian actors in Nigerian movies as well and that has led to the popularity of Ghanaian actors almost like their Nigerian counterparts. Nigerian actors have also starred in some Ghanaian productions, in order for the film to capture wider audience. Van Vicker, a popular Ghanaian actor, has starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nigerian films and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share the colloquial &quot;Nollywood&quot;.

==Popularity and appeal==
In 2009, Unesco rated Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after Indian cinema in terms of output.

===Africa===
The overwhelming popularity of Nollywood productions has also led to backlash against Nigerian films in several countries. For instance, there have been reported cases of shops selling Nigerian films being raided by the police in Ghana; according to them, &quot;they are struggling not to be colonized by Nigerian movies&quot;. Several other governments have also introduced protectionist measures, some of which include introducing spurious taxes for production houses who want to shoot films in their countries. In July 2010, Ghana started demanding US$1,000 from visiting Nigerian actors and US$5,000 from producers and directors. The Democratic Republic of Congo had also tried to ban Nigerian films. Jean Rouch, a champion of indigenous art in Niger, compared Nollywood to AIDS. He stated that there seems to be a &quot;Nigerianization&quot; of Africa, worrying that the whole continent has come to &quot;snap its fingers the Nigerian way&quot;.

===Europe===
The Nigerian film industry has a strong following in the African diaspora community in Europe, especially in the United Kingdom.

<text>The GROM Military Unit (Polish: &quot;Jednostka Wojskowa GROM&quot;), is a Polish special forces unit and forms part of the Special Troops Command of the Polish Armed Forces. It is believed to consist of around 250 operatives plus support personnel. GROM is considered to be the most elite unit in the Polish Armed Forces.

The unit&#x27;s other name is Jednostka Wojskowa 2305 (Military Unit No. 2305). Each member of the unit is required to speak at least two languages and have basic medical skills. GROM operators gained the nickname of &quot;The Surgeons&quot; due to their extensive medical training and knowledge and their surgical ability to coordinate and execute special operations. GROM was formed in 1990 with training provided to the initial GROM operators by the US Army Delta Force and the British Army Special Air Service.

==History==
===Early history===
GROM, which stands for &quot;Grupa Reagowania Operacyjno-Manewrowego&quot; (English: &quot;Operational Maneuvering Response Group&quot;) and literally means &quot;thunderbolt&quot;, is one of five special forces units in the Special Troops Command. It was officially activated on July 13, 1990. It is deployed in a variety of special operations and unconventional warfare roles, including anti-terrorist operations and projection of force behind enemy lines.

The unit was named after the Silent Unseen (Polish: &quot;Cichociemni Spadochroniarze Armii Krajowej&quot;) – Poland&#x27;s elite World War II special-operations unit.

In the 1970s and 1980s, there were several formations of special forces units within Poland, but these were either trained in purely military tasks (sabotage, disruption of communications and such) or in purely counter-terrorist roles. After the Polish embassy in Bern was taken over by a group of four Polish emigrants calling themselves Polish Revolutionary Home Army in 1982, General Edwin Rozłubirski proposed that a clandestine military unit be established to counter the threat from terrorism and other unconventional threats. This proposal, however, was initially rejected by the People&#x27;s Army of Poland.

In 1989, many Jews were allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel. Poland was one of the handful of countries that provided aid in the form of organization for the operation, later dubbed Operation Bridge (&quot;Operacja Most&quot;). After two Polish diplomats were shot in Beirut, Lt. Col. Sławomir Petelicki was sent to Lebanon to secure the transfer of civilians and the Polish diplomatic outposts.

Upon his return to Poland, he presented his plan for the creation of a special military unit to the Ministry of Interior, a force that would be trained in special operations to be deployed in the defense of Polish citizens in situations similar to the one in Lebanon. Petelicki&#x27;s ideas were well received, and on June 13, 1990, GROM was formally established as JW 2305.

Sławomir Petelicki was chosen as the first commander of the newly formed unit. As a Polish intelligence officer from the Służba Bezpieczeństwa specializing in sabotage and subversion, he seemed perfectly suited to oversee the unit&#x27;s initial formation. He gathered around himself a group of like-minded and professional soldiers, functionaries and set about choosing soldiers that would be fit for special operations. Due to the high risks involved in special service, it was decided that all men should be from professional service. The first batch of recruits all came from a variety of already-existing special units within the Polish Armed Forces. Among these were:

* 1 Batalion Szturmowy from Lubliniec (then known as &quot;1 Pulk Specjalny Komandosów&quot; and now known as JW Komandosów)
* 48, 56 and 62 Kompania Specjalna
* 6 Brygada Desantowo-Szturmowa
* Polish Navy divers
* Anti-terrorist units of the Policja
* Mechanised Warfare Officer School in Wrocław
* Reconnaissance units of PAF

Out of the possible recruits, only a small group passed the training. Many of these initial instructors were trained by the special forces of the United States and the United Kingdom. Currently, Jednostka Wojskowa GROM is co-operating with similar units of other NATO countries.

During its formative first few years, JW 2305 remained completely secret and hidden from the public. It was first reported to the press in 1992 and became known to the public in 1994, after their first major military operation in Haiti.

Before October 1, 1999, JW 2305 was subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, after which time command was transferred to the Minister of National Defence, until 2007. Since 2007 JW GROM is under the command of Dowódca Wojsk Specjalnych (Commander of Polish Special Forces).

===War on Terror===
A 40-man GROM element deployed to Afghanistan in early 2002.

For the 2003 invasion of Iraq, GROM formed the part of the core of the Naval Special Operations Task Group, along with US Navy SEALs, British Royal Marines and attached US Psy Ops and civil affairs teams. On March 20, 2003, US Marines from 1st F.A.S.T. Company and GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals, whilst US Marines from 1st F.A.S.T. Company and US Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 seized the MABOT oil terminal; both terminals were seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM and SEAL operators. A mixed team of 35 GROM operators and 20 US Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 5 seized the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, 57 miles northeast of Baghdad. Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, there were no casualties to the team (with the exception of one GROM soldier, who broke an ankle during the insertion from a US Air Force MH-53J Pave Low helicopter. SEAL and GROM units continued to cooperate throughout the rest of the invasion phase, with raids and anti-sniper missions in Baghdad.

Following the invasion, GROM operators formed the core of Task Unit Thunder, as an element of CJSOTF-AP (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula), providing a Tier-1 counterterrorism unit for the task force. Along with Task Unit Raider (consisting of Det One operators), both units became the task force&#x27;s primary direct action assets, operating in conjunction on multiple occasions.

A GROM sniper aided Det One&#x27;s in its first &quot;real&quot; mission - a close-target reconnaissance operation - in which the sniper apprehended the target, (a suspected insurgent sniper). GROM&#x27;s early success in Iraq made it a valuable contributor to CJSOTF-AP. In September 2004, US Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle was temporarily assigned to GROM&#x27;s Combat Team B in Baghdad for a week. The CIA reportedly found GROM snipers useful due to their low rules of engagement threshold. In 2007, US Army Special Forces, Polish GROM conducted Operation Jackal against insurgents in Diwaniyah.

In 2007, GROM and JW Komandosów were deployed to Kandahar (after earlier successful tours of Iraq operating alongside US Navy SEALs) under direct US Command. They weren&#x27;t restricted by any national caveats-the only restriction placed on them was regarding cross-border operations into Pakistan. Along with Direct Action successes, they were considered very effective in training and mentoring Afghan National Police units.

==Training==
Candidates applying to serve in JW GROM have to pass psychological and durability tests, along with the so-called truth test, a physically and psychologically exhausting field test designed to filter out the weaker applicants.

The training of GROM soldiers includes a variety of disciplines. All of them undergo the same specialized training in anti-terrorism and special operations, as well as sniping, parachuting, and the training peculiar to frogmen. In four-man teams, each soldier must be prepared to assume the respective responsibilities of his colleagues, should it become necessary. JW GROM receives basic special operations training from the Swedish Navy&#x27;s Special Command for Tactical Operations based in Karlskrona, Sweden&#x27;s primary Naval Base. Approximately 75% of GROM personnel are trained as medics or paramedics. In addition, each group is supported by several professional physicians. GROM soldiers are trained in capture or kill methods.

They have three different training levels, those being green, blue and black. Green deals with field reconnaissance, deep cover sabotage, population extraction/evacuation, and elimination of personal threats. Blue deals with maritime and naval interjections, undergoing intense special naval operation training, which includes underwater diving, naval sabotage, and naval reconnaissance. Finally, black training is the highest level of training, dealing with hostage rescue, VIP protection, and area protection.

<text>In mathematics, an abelian surface is a 2-dimensional abelian variety.

One-dimensional complex tori are just elliptic curves and are all algebraic, but Riemann discovered that most complex tori of dimension 2 are not algebraic via the Riemann bilinear relations. Essentially, these are conditions on the parameter space of period matrices for complex tori which define an algebraic subvariety. This subvariety contains all of the points whose period matrices correspond to a period matrix of an abelian variety.

The algebraic ones are called abelian surfaces and are exactly the 2-dimensional abelian varieties. Most of their theory is a special case of the theory of higher-dimensional tori or abelian varieties. Finding criteria for a complex torus of dimension 2 to be a product of two elliptic curves (up to isogeny) was a popular subject of study in the nineteenth century.

Invariants: The plurigenera are all 1. The surface is diffeomorphic to &quot;S&quot;1×&quot;S&quot;1×&quot;S&quot;1×&quot;S&quot;1 so the fundamental group is Z4.

[[Homological mirror symmetry#Hodge diamond|Hodge diamond]]:
Examples: A product of two elliptic curves. The Jacobian variety of a genus 2 curve.

<text>Grey Wethers consists of a pair of prehistoric stone circles, situated on grassy plateau to the north of Postbridge, Dartmoor, in the United Kingdom.

== Description ==

The circles are each approximately in diameter, and less than five metres apart. Their centre points are aligned almost exactly north to south. The northern circle has 20 stones remaining, while the southern has 29 – all of a relatively consistent size, mostly between in height.

An excavation was carried out in 1898 and a number of charcoal fragments were discovered within the circles. The circles were restored and many fallen stones re-erected in 1909.

== Folklore ==
As with many ancient Dartmoor landmarks, Grey Wethers is the subject of local folklore, explaining the origin of the name (&#x27;wether&#x27; is an Old English word meaning sheep).

One story tells of a farmer who had recently moved to Dartmoor and was foolish enough to criticise the sheep on sale at Tavistock Market. He stopped for a drink at the Warren House Inn, and helped by several pints of cider, the locals persuaded him that there was an excellent flock of high quality sheep nearby which he would be welcome to buy. They walked off in search of them, and through the mist the farmer saw what he took to be a fine flock. He agreed to the sale, and returned to the site the following morning to find that what he had taken to be sheep were actually the stones of Grey Wethers.

<doc id="974191" wikidata="Q12053830" url="?curid=974191" title="Bulkhead (partition)">
<text>A bulkhead is an upright wall within the hull of a ship, within the fuselage of an airplane, or a car. Other kinds of partition elements within a ship are decks and deckheads.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;bulki&quot; meant &quot;cargo&quot; in Old Norse. During the 15th century sailors and builders in Europe realized that walls within a vessel would prevent cargo from shifting during passage. In shipbuilding, any vertical panel was called a head. So walls installed abeam (side-to-side) in a vessel&#x27;s hull were called &quot;bulkheads&quot;. Now, the term bulkhead applies to every vertical panel aboard a ship, except for the hull itself.

== History ==
Bulkheads were known to the ancient Greeks, who employed bulkheads in triremes to support the back of rams. By the Athenian trireme era (500 BC), the hull was strengthened by enclosing the bow behind the ram, forming a bulkhead compartment. Instead of using bulkheads to protect ships against rams, Greeks preferred to reinforce the hull with extra timber along the waterline, making larger ships almost resistant to ramming by smaller ones.

Bulkhead partitions are considered to have been a feature of Chinese junks, a type of ship. Song dynasty author Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the hulls of Chinese ships had a bulkhead build. The 5th-century book &quot;Garden of Strange Things&quot; by Liu Jingshu mentioned that a ship could allow water to enter the bottom without sinking. Archaeological evidence of bulkhead partitions has been found on a 24 m (78 ft) long Song dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled compartmental sections built watertight, dated to about 1277.

Texts written by writers such as Marco Polo (1254–1324), Ibn Battuta (1304–1369), Niccolò Da Conti (1395–1469), and Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) describe the bulkhead partitions of East Asian shipbuilding. An account of the early fifteenth century describes Indian ships as being built in compartments so that even if one part was damaged, the rest remained intact—a forerunner of the modern day watertight compartments using bulkheads.

As wood began to be replaced by iron in European ships in the 18th century, new structures, like bulkheads, started to become prevalent. Bulkhead partitions became widespread in Western shipbuilding during the early 19th century. Benjamin Franklin wrote in a 1787 letter that &quot;as these vessels are not to be laden with goods, their holds may without inconvenience be divided into separate apartments, after the Chinese manner, and each of these apartments caulked tight so as to keep out water.&quot; A 19th-century book on shipbuilding attributes the introduction of watertight bulkheads to Charles Wye Williams, known for his steamships.

== Purpose ==
Bulkheads in a ship serve several purposes: 
* increase the structural rigidity of the vessel, 
* divide functional areas into rooms and 
* create watertight compartments that can contain water in the case of a hull breach or other leak. 
* some bulkheads and decks are fire-resistance rated to achieve compartmentalisation, a passive fire protection measure; see firewall (construction).
Not all bulkheads are intended to be watertight, in modern ships the bottom floor is supported against the hull by transverse walls(bulkheads) and longitudinal walls, being common to use bulkheads with lightening holes.

On an aircraft, bulkheads divide the cabin into multiple areas. On passenger aircraft a common application is for physically dividing cabins used for different classes of service (e.g. economy and business.) On combination cargo/passenger, or &quot;combi&quot; aircraft, bulkhead walls are inserted to divide areas intended for passenger seating and cargo storage.

== Requirements of bulkheads ==
=== Fire-resistance ===

Openings in fire-resistance rated bulkheads and decks must be firestopped to restore the fire-resistance ratings that would otherwise be compromised if the openings were left unsealed. The authority having jurisdiction for such measures varies depending upon the flag of the ship. Merchant vessels are typically subject to the regulations and inspections of the coast guards of the flag country. Combat ships are subject to the regulations set out by the navy of the country that owns the ship.

=== Prevention of electromagnetic damage ===
Bulkheads and decks of warships may be fully electrically grounded as a countermeasure against damage from electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic pulse due to nearby nuclear or electromagnetic bomb detonations, which could severely damage the vital electronic systems on a ship.

In the case of firestops, cable jacketing is usually removed within the seal and firestop rubber modules are internally fitted with copper shields, which contact the cables&#x27; armour to ground the seal.

== Automotive ==
Most passenger vehicles and some freight vehicles will have a bulkhead which separates the engine compartment from the passenger compartment or cab; the automotive use is analogous to the nautical term in that the bulkhead is an internal wall which separates different parts of the vehicle. Some passenger vehicles (particularly sedan/saloon-type vehicles) will also have a rear bulkhead, which separates the passenger compartment from the trunk/boot.

== Other uses of the term ==
The term was later applied to other vehicles, such as railroad cars, hopper cars, trams, automobiles, aircraft or spacecraft, as well as to containers, intermediate bulk containers and fuel tanks. In some of these cases bulkheads are airtight to prevent air leakage or the spread of a fire. The term may also be used for the &quot;end walls&quot; of bulkhead flatcars.

Mechanically, a partition or panel through which connectors pass, or a connector designed to pass through a partition.

In architecture the term is frequently used to denote any boxed in beam or other downstand from a ceiling and by extension even the vertical downstand face of an area of lower ceiling beyond. This usage presumably derives from experience on boats where to maintain the structural function personnel openings through bulkheads always retain a portion of the bulkhead crossing the head of the opening. Head strikes on these downstand elements are commonplace, hence in architecture any overhead downstand element comes to be referred to as a bulkhead.

Bulkhead also refers to a moveable structure often found in an Olympic-size swimming pool, as a means to set the pool into a &quot;double-ended short course&quot; configuration, or long-course, depending on the type of event being run. Pool bulkheads are usually air-fillable, but power driven solutions do exist.

The term is also used to refer to large retroactively installed pressure barriers for temporary or permanent use, often during maintenance or construction activities.

<doc id="974195" wikidata="Q688981" url="?curid=974195" title="SIG Sauer P220">
<text>The SIG Sauer P220 is a semi-automatic pistol designed in 1975 by the SIG Arms AG division of Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (now SIG Holding AG), and produced by J. P. Sauer &amp; Sohn, in Eckernförde. It is currently manufactured by both SIG Sauer companies: SIG Sauer GMBH, of Eckernförde, Germany; and SIG Sauer, Inc., of New Hampshire, United States.
== History ==
Not to be confused with SIG P210 series, which licensed the Petter-Browning system from SACM of France in 1938 , the SIG Sauer P220 was developed for release in 1975 for the Swiss Army as a replacement for the SIG P210, which had been developed during World War II; in service it is known as &quot;Pistole 75&quot; (P75). For the commercial production and distribution of the P220, SIG partnered with J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn of Germany, thus, the P220 and all subsequent pistols from SIG and J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn are properly known as SIG Sauer pistols.

In 1975, Switzerland became the first nation to officially adopt the P220 as the &quot;Pistole 75&quot; (P75) chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. Other nations to adopt it for military use include Japan (general issue) and Denmark (which has the earlier P210 in general issue) only to special forces. It was followed by the SIG Sauer P226, incorporating a double stack magazine.

Upon completion of their military service, all Swiss soldiers can obtain ownership of their ordnance weapon for a nominal fee; in particular commissioned officers and soldiers of the medical forces of the Swiss armed forces can obtain ownership of their P220 service pistols by paying an administrative fee of thirty Swiss francs.

In the United States this handgun was originally sold in a modified form as the Browning BDA from 1977 to 1980.

==Design==
The P220 was developed in 1975 by SIG and produced and distributed by J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn. A new locking system which is known as the SIG Sauer system was introduced as well as a number of other innovations. This nomenclature is found on the Browning BDA version of the P220 sold from 1975.

The SIG P220 is recoil operated using the SIG Sauer system. Instead of the locking lugs and recesses milled into the barrel and slide of Browning-derived weapons such as the Colt M1911A1, Browning Hi-Power and CZ 75, the P220 variants (and many other modern pistols) lock the barrel and slide together using an enlarged breech section on the barrel locking into the ejection port. After firing the round, the slide and barrel move back a few millimeters together, then the chamber is pulled downwards by the cam surface and thus unlocked by the slide, which covers the remaining distance on its own due to its inertia. The recoil spring moves the slide forward again, inserting a new cartridge from the magazine into the chamber and cocking the trigger. The barrel is lifted out of the control gate and locks in the case ejection port.

The slide of the P220 series is a heavy-gauge sheet metal stamping with a welded-on nose section incorporating an internal barrel bushing. The breech block portion is a machined insert attached to the slide by means of a roll pin visible from either side. The frame is of forged alloy with a hard-anodized coating. The SIG P220 series incorporates a hammer-drop lever to the rear of the trigger on the left side, which first appeared on the Sauer 38H before World War II. After chambering a round, the hammer will be cocked, so for safe carriage the hammer drop is actuated with the thumb, dropping the hammer in a safe manner.

The double action / single action (DA/SA) trigger design of the P220 is also a SIG Sauer innovation similar to the J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn 38H pistol. Further design refinements include a hammer decocking lever and positive firing pin block safety.

The P220 also features an automatic firing pin block safety which is activated by the trigger mechanism, similar to the one used in the Czech CZ-038 from the period after the Second World War. The pistol may now be holstered, and can be fired without actuating any other controls. The first shot will be fired in double-action mode, unless the user chooses to manually cock the hammer. Double-action trigger pressure is measured at approximately 12–14 pounds, with subsequent shots being fired in single-action mode with a lighter trigger pressure of approximately 6 pounds. There is no separate safety lever to manipulate; the hammer drop is the only manual safety device. As with other double-action pistols such as the Walther P38 and Beretta 92F, some training is required to minimize the difference caused by the different trigger pressure between the first double-action shot and subsequent single-action shots when the hammer is cocked by the rearward movement of the slide.

SIG Sauer refers to their safety systems as a Four Point System. The four types of safety are:

# the de-cocker, which allows the shooter to lower the hammer safely, while there is a round in the chamber. When the de-cocking occurs, the hammer is lowered but it still stays away from the firing pin.
# the safety notch, prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin accidentally.
# the firing pin has its own safety, which makes sure that the pin will not move forward. That is, until the trigger is pulled, at which time the safety is removed and the pin is pushed forward to meet the cartridge&#x27;s primer. This third safety is also the gun&#x27;s drop safety. Even when dropped from a reasonable height, with a round in the chamber, the gun will not fire.
# the slide has a notch, which separates the firing pin from the cartridge. Unlike the aforementioned firing pin safety, this one is there to make sure that the gun does not accidentally discharge a round while it is cycling. This is called the &quot;trigger bar disconnector&quot;.

Despite these safety measures, the Sig Sauer P220 has been cited in accidental fatalities. One example is the case of Officer Jesse Paderez of the San Fernando Police Department, California. On 17 July 2002, he was &quot;accidentally shot and killed when his Sig P220, .45 caliber service weapon, fell to the ground and discharged, striking him in the head. He had gone to the police station to pick up a patrol car...as he walked across the parking lot, his weapon, still in its holster, fell to the ground and discharged when the hammer struck the pavement.&quot;

==Variants==

The original 1975 SIG Sauer P220 had a &#x27;heel-mounted&#x27; magazine release lever located at the rear of the magazine well and a lanyard loop which was typical of handguns made for police and military purposes. Newer SIG P220s utilize a push button magazine release to the left side of the grip, behind the trigger and do not have lanyard loops. The P220 was then later modified with a redesigned slide, grips, and other minor changes to the frame.

In 2007, a Picatinny rail was added to the frame under the barrel as standard on all models whose number ends in R. The major difference in slide design, between the older model SIG pistols and the current production, is that the older model slides were stamped whereas the current production models are milled on a CNC machine. The stamped models have an end piece at the muzzle end which is welded in place, to complete the slide. Additionally, the older stamped slides feature a removable breech block. This breech block is pinned to the slide with two hollow roll pins, one pressed inside the other, with their split ends opposed. The newer milled slides are a one-piece unit and do not have a removable breech block.

The SIG P220 also comes in P220R and P220ST versions. Also in 2019 a new variant is available called the P220R Hunter that is chambered in 10mm and factory coated with a KRYPTEC camo pattern. The base and R models have an aluminum alloy frame with a stainless steel slide (if made by SIG Sauer in the US; German made versions still use a blued, stamped steel slide); the ST model has a stainless steel frame and slide. The R and ST models also have a Picatinny rail, beneath the slide and barrel, allowing for fitting of accessories such as lights or laser sights.

Originally, all SIG P220s were DA/SA and featured a decocking lever (and no external safety) just forward of the slide catch. This changed with the introduction of double-action only (DAO), Double Action Kellerman (DAK), and single action (SA) models. The DAO and DAK models do not have a de-cocking lever or safety, and the SA models only feature an M1911 style external safety. SIG has also introduced the SAS (SIG Anti-Snag) model—which is dehorned, has no accessory rail, and is designed for concealed carry—and the Elite model, which includes the new short-reset trigger, a beavertail grip, front strap grip checkering, and front slide cocking serrations.

All modern P220 variants are available in .45 ACP and, as of January 2015, 10mm Auto.

===Browning BDA (early American import)===
The P220 was initially imported to the United States as the Browning Double Action (BDA) and then as the Sigarms P220. The P220s sold under the Browning Arms Company marque in the United States –1980 had the heel-mounted magazine release lever until Browning discontinued it from its product line in the early 1980s; the discontinuation from the Browning product lineup was due to its poor sales and its then-&#x27;space age&#x27; appearance (similar to the AR-15/M16). 

These particular P220s (or Browning BDAs) will have the stamping scroll which reads &#x27;Browning Arms Company Morgan, Utah and Montreal PQ&#x27; on the left hand side of the slide and &#x27;SIG-Sauer System Made in W. Germany&#x27; on the right-hand side with the serial number scrolled beneath. 

The Browning version has the sides of the slides polished and blued. The frame is aluminum. The handgrips have Browning on the right side only. On the right side of the slide is the serial number. The Browning BDA 45 shown in the photographs has a production series number starting with 395. The RP that follows shows that this particular handgun was manufactured in 1977.

It was offered for sale in .45 ACP, 9 mm, .38 Super (a rare model) and 7.65mm Parabellum (an even rarer model).
Some units were adopted by Huntington Beach Police.

===P220 Rail===
The P220 Rail (or P220R) is effectively the same as the P220, but comes with an accessory rail located on the forward end of the frame of the firearm for accepting accessories such as a weapon light or laser. While the provided rail is similar to the Mil-STD-1913 Picatinny rail design, as implemented by SIG for this gun it has a proprietary cross-section form that conflicts with some early design Picatinny-compatible equipment. The P220R with its rail became the standard configuration of most recent and current production P220s which are no longer differentiated by the &quot;Rail&quot; or &quot;R&quot; designation.

=== P220 Carry ===
A P220 with a shortened barrel (3.9&quot;) and slide, but a full-sized frame that accepted 8-round magazines. It was available in DA/SA, SA, and DAK variants. All models, with the exception of the SAS concealed-carry version, came with an accessory rail. A Legion Series version was also offered. As of 2023 the P220 Carry is discontinued.

=== P220 Compact ===
A P220 with shortened barrel and slide (3.9&quot;) and compact frame that accepts 6-round magazines. It is possible to use the 8-round magazines of the P220 and P220 Carry which give it an 8+1 capacity. Adapters are available to cover the portion of the magazine which protrudes from the bottom of the grip. It was offered in four versions: blued with beavertail, stainless (two-tone) with beavertail, blued with rail (no beavertail) and stainless with rail (no beavertail). It served as a replacement for the discontinued P245 and addressed complaints about the P220 Carry&#x27;s full-size frame in a concealed carry pistol. The 220 Compact has since been discontinued.

=== P220 Combat ===
The two &quot;Combat&quot; models, the P220 Combat and P220 Combat TB (Threaded Barrel), are available in DA/SA only. Their frames are colored &quot;Flat Dark Earth&quot; in compliance with the Combat Pistol program. The Combat model comes with night sights, a Nitron-finished slide and barrel, phosphated internals, and a Picatinny rail. The TB model features an extra 0.6&quot; on the barrel, and external threads to accept a suppressor. The P220 Combat is chambered only in .45 ACP, and is supplied with one 8-round magazine and one extended 10-round magazine.

=== P220 ST ===
A version of the SIG P220 handgun made by SIG Sauer with a reversible magazine release, stainless steel slide, and stainless steel frame. Changing to a stainless steel frame from the lighter alloy frame normally used is meant to reduce felt recoil. The ST models are typically bare stainless (all &quot;silver&quot;), though SIG Sauer has produced Nitron finished (all &quot;black&quot;) ST versions for police department trial and evaluation (T&amp;E) guns.

===P220 Classic 22===
This model&#x27;s primary purpose is as a practice or range pistol. The Classic 22 model replaces the typical stainless steel centerfire slide assembly with a lighter aluminum rimfire slide chambered in .22 LR. The Classic 22 also has a different barrel, guide rod, and recoil spring than the larger caliber models. It incorporates the same frame and operation as centerfire P220 models. The Classic 22 model is available as a stand-alone firearm or as a conversion kit to an existing centerfire P220. Likewise, conversion kits (the SIG Sauer X-Change Kits) exist to convert a .22 LR P220 into .45 ACP. The conversion can be accomplished by field stripping the firearm and replacing the slide assembly and magazine—a process that can be accomplished in minutes.

The Classic 22 use a 10-round polymer magazine in lieu of the steel magazines used by the centerfire models and conversion kits.

The P220 Classic 22 should not be confused with the SIG Sauer Mosquito .22 LR pistol. The Classic 22 is a full-sized P220 while the Mosquito is modeled on the P226 but is 90% of the size. Another difference is that the Classic 22 is manufactured by SIG Sauer while the Mosquito is made under license by German Sport Guns GmbH. The size difference means that the Mosquito cannot be converted &quot;up&quot;, and full-size SIG Sauer pistols cannot use the Mosquito&#x27;s slide assembly.

=== P220 Legion ===
A variant offered in SIG&#x27;s high-end Legion Series, the P220 Legion features several improvements and upgrades over the base model including signature Legion gray PVD coating, G-10 grips with Legion medallion, low profile controls, X-RAY3 sights, and an optics-cut slide for mounting a red dot sight (in later production). The frame is modified from the base model with a reduced and contoured beaver tail, an undercut trigger guard, and front slide serrations. The P220 Legion is offered in DA/SA and SAO. Beginning in 2017, a 10mm version is also offered. A limited edition P220 Legion Carry SAO was released in 2020, but was only produced in small numbers before being discontinued.

=== P225 / P225-A1 ===
The SIG P225 is a more compact version of the SIG P220. A new German police standard issued in the mid-1970s prompted SIG-Sauer, Heckler &amp; Koch, and Walther to develop new pistols that met the standard: the Walther P5, the SIG-Sauer P225 (known as the P6) and the Heckler &amp; Koch P7. (In addition, Mauser had a design, the HsP, that never went into full production.) Walter Ludwig was involved in the design of the Walther, SIG-Sauer and Mauser entrants in the German Police selection. Each German state was free to buy whichever pistol it wanted to. Initially, the P220 was submitted; the P225/P6 was a revision created to conform with the mid-1970s West German police requirements for its standard service pistol. The SIG-Sauer P225 was the least expensive (due mainly to the inventive design) and received the majority of the orders. To be able to manufacture that many handguns, SIG acquired a controlling interest in J. P. Sauer &amp; Sohn in Eckernförde, Germany to manufacture parts for the P220. This is also where all P225s were manufactured. The only difference between the P6 and P225—the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6&#x27;s trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6s had fixed sights only. Genuine P225s manufactured for the West German Police will have a &quot;P6&quot; stamp on the right side of the slide.

A new police standard was adopted in Germany in 1995, and the P225 is in the process of being replaced. German police pistols can be identified by the hammer, which has a small &quot;ear&quot; or &quot;hook&quot;. According to section 7.7 of the German manual, the cutout is the &quot;Deformationssporn&quot;, which means &quot;deformation spur&quot;. This was a requirement of the West German Police for all their P6 pistols, to alert police armorers if the pistol was dropped on its hammer. Many of these surplus German police pistols were imported into the United States. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In states with limits on magazine capacity, the P225/P6 was usually in high demand. Most have a push button magazine release located behind the triggerguard, though they (but not the later P225-A1) were also available with a heel-mounted magazine release lever as used on the original P220, which was not a popular feature in the American marketplace as it makes magazine changes slower even though it greatly reduces the chances of an accidental magazine release. The heel-mounted magazine release lever also reduces the incidence of lost magazines in combat as a result of speed reloading magazines, as is common with the push button magazine release which only requires the user to push this button to eject the magazine rather than drag it out by hand as one must do with the heel-mounted magazine release lever.

;P225-A1
P225-A1 was introduced by SIG in 2015. It was based on the P225, with a number of refinements. Notably, the place of origin on the slide was SIG Sauer Inc. of Exeter, New Hampshire. There was a new contour to the frame, a short reset trigger, a milled slide (the earlier one was stamped), and two barrel lengths (one standard and the other threaded for a suppressor). The suppressor model came with high sights. The P225-A1 was discontinued in late 2019.

=== P245 ===
The SIG P245 variant is chambered only in .45 ACP (hence the name) and was developed primarily for the US market as a civilian&#x27;s concealed sidearm, or as a police backup weapon. The SIG P245 has a reversible magazine release giving the user the choice of operating it with their left or right thumb. It normally takes 6-round magazines, but can also accept the 7-, 8-, or 10-round magazines designed for the P220. A grip extender is available for use with these longer magazines. One of the major differences in construction between the P245 and the P220 Compact is that the P245 was only built using the older stamped steel slide design with a removable breech block, while some of the later P220 Compact variants were available with an extended grip tang.

The P245 is no longer manufactured by SIG, having been replaced by the P220 Carry and the P220 Compact.

<doc id="974198" wikidata="Q8055519" url="?curid=974198" title="York Racecourse">
<text>York Racecourse is a horse racing venue in York, North Yorkshire, England.
It is the third biggest racecourse in Britain in terms of total prize money offered, and second behind Ascot in prize money offered per meeting. It attracts around 350,000 racegoers per year and stages three of the UK&#x27;s 36 annual Group 1 races – the Juddmonte International Stakes, the Nunthorpe Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks.

==Location==

The course is located in the south-west of the city, next to the former Terry&#x27;s of York factory, The Chocolate Works. It is situated on an expanse of ground which has been known since pre-medieval times as the Knavesmire, from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;knave&quot; meaning a man of low standing, and &quot;mire&quot; meaning a swampy pasture for cattle. For this reason, the racecourse is still sometimes referred to as &quot;The Knavesmire&quot;. The Knavesmire was originally common pasture, belonging to the city. It was also the scene of the hanging of Dick Turpin in 1739.

==History==

Racing in York dates back to at least Roman times, with some archaeological evidence suggesting that there may have been equine activities that could have included forms of racing on the site of the Knavesmire as early as neolithic times. The city corporation is known to have given its support to the sport from 1530 and, in 1607, racing is known to have taken place on the frozen River Ouse, between Micklegate Tower and Skeldergate Postern. A famous yearly race for a golden bell was taking place in the nearby Forest of Galtres in 1590.

There is some uncertainty over when racing first arrived at the current site. The official stance of York Racecourse itself is that racing was first held on the Knavesmire when York&#x27;s race meeting was moved in 1730 from a previous site at Clifton Ings which was prone to flooding. This is the line taken by the early racing historian, Pick, who maintained that the first race run over the Knavesmire course was the King&#x27;s Guineas of 1731. There are multiple attestations to this previous racecourse at Clifton Ings, where racing can be traced back at least as far as 1709 and where, in 1714, &quot;such was the concourse of nobility and gentry that attended York races that one hundred and fifty coaches were at one time on the course&quot;. The uncertainty lies in the period 1709–1731 and on this, early sources are confusing.

Orton&#x27;s &quot;Turf Annals of York and Doncaster&quot;, which records the results of races at this time, has them taking place at &quot;Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings&quot; in the period 1709 and 1731 which would support the official view. However, Sheahan and Whellan, 19th century York historians, have racing taking place in &quot;both&quot; places in 1709 – &quot;a regular race meeting on Clifton Ings&quot; and, in the same year, a collection taking place among the citizens to purchase five plates as prizes for a meeting on the Knavesmire. Drake&#x27;s &quot;Eboracum&quot;, another early history, when talking of York&#x27;s races says, &quot;&quot;Clifton-ings&quot; was for several years the place of trial; but upon a misunderstanding with the owner of that ground, or great part of it, the race was altered; and &quot;Knavesmire&quot;, a common pasture belonging to the city, was pitched upon for that purpose.&quot; Since, Drake was writing in 1736, it is deemed unlikely that he would write in such a manner if the move to Knavesmire had been so recent. There is also some slight confusion arising from the running of Royal Cups at nearby Black Hambleton. A Royal Plate was raced for &quot;at York&quot; from 1711, but the Black Hambleton Cup was older still.

The Saunders &amp; Co. &quot;History&quot;, using all these sources concludes &quot;the races were held annually on both courses – at Clifton Ings previous to and for some years subsequent to the year 1709, and at Knavesmire at and from that date; and that most probably in or about the year 1731, the races were done away with at the former place and transferred to the latter.&quot;

What is clear, whenever races were first run on the Knavesmire, is that York was the first centre after Newmarket to formulate a structured race programme, starting in 1751 with the Great Subscription Purses.

The Knavesmire course, as the name suggests, was often very swampy, and in 1776, heavy rains meant that horses had to race for about fifty yards up to their knees in water.

By the 19th century there were two main meetings at York – the Spring Meeting in May and another in August. These were supplemented by the Yorkshire Union Hunt Meeting in October, and a steeplechase meeting in April. At the August meeting in 1804 Alicia Thornton, who as a result has been called the &quot;first female jockey&quot;, took part in a horse race at the racecourse at Knavesmire.

At the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, the local military commander General Sir John Byng was absent because he had two horses running at York that day, and delegated command to his deputy, who failed to peacefully disperse the large crowd, resulting in 18 deaths and hundreds of injuries.

By the 1830s and 40s, support from noble families like the Fitzwilliams had dwindled and the continuance of the meeting was in jeopardy. Improvements in transportation had reduced the need for rural landowners to keep York townhouses so August race week in the city was no longer the occasion it was. Many races were reduced to matches or even walkovers.

On 31 May 1982, Pope John Paul II visited York racecourse and drew a reported audience of 190,000.

On 22 September 1984, the racecourse hosted its first music concert headlined by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. In recent years, concerts have been arranged after race meetings in June and July and since 2015 it has hosted the Yorfest.

The second day of the 2014 Tour de France started from the racecourse.

==Facilities==
In 1754, at the instigation of the Marquess of Rockingham the first grandstand was built at a cost of £1,250 by the architect John Carr. New stands were erected in 1890, incorporating much of the original building. The late 20th century saw progressive development of the facilities. A new five-tier grandstand was opened in 1965, the Melrose Stand was opened in 1989 and this was quickly followed by the award-winning Knavesmire Stand, with additional conference facilities in 1996. 2003 saw the opening of the Ebor Stand. The course now has a spectator capacity of 60,000.

In the 18th century the racecourse was horseshoe in shape and was &quot;judged to be the best race[course] in England for seeing the diversion.&quot; In 2005 the track was extended from the end of the home straight to make a full round course, this was to host the 2 m 4 f Gold Cup for the Royal meeting which was moved from Ascot to York that year. This meant 2 mile races were run on the round course, starting just before the winning post. The old 2 mile start was discontinued. The previous layout change occurred in the early 1970s, when to accommodate the York ring road (A64), opened in 1976, the straight course was reduced from 7 furlongs to 6 furlongs and the new 7 furlong chute was built.

==Important meetings==

York&#x27;s most important meeting is the Ebor Festival held annually in August. The feature of this meeting is the Ebor Handicap, one of Europe&#x27;s premier handicap races.

The Juddmonte International meeting is another significant date in York&#x27;s racing calendar, home as it is to the Juddmonte International Stakes. The 2012 renewal of this race, won by Frankel was the second highest rated race of the year in international ratings.

In 2005, York Racecourse acted as a replacement host to the Royal Ascot meeting, due to its usual home at Ascot Racecourse being closed for a £185 million redevelopment, attracting a 5-day attendance of over 224,000. It also hosted the St Leger in 2006.

York also has its own radio station &#x27;York Raceday Radio&#x27; (1602 kHz, medium wave) which can be received up to from the course.

==Awards==

The track won the Racecourse of the Year title in 1997, 2003 and 2017, and came out on top in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper survey of all Britain&#x27;s racecourses.

<doc id="974207" wikidata="Q2153489" url="?curid=974207" title="Ring circuit">
<text>In electricity supply design, a ring circuit is an electrical wiring technique in which sockets and the distribution point are connected in a ring. It is contrasted with the usual radial circuit, in which sockets and the distribution point are connected in a line with the distribution point at one end.

Ring circuits are also known as &quot;ring final circuits&quot; and often incorrectly as &quot;ring mains&quot;, a term used historically, or informally simply as &quot;rings&quot;.

It is used primarily in the United Kingdom, where it was developed, and to a lesser extent in Ireland and Hong Kong.

This design enables the use of smaller-diameter wire than would be used in a radial circuit of equivalent total current capacity. The reduced diameter conductors in the flexible cords connecting an appliance to the plug intended for use with sockets on a ring circuit are individually protected by a fuse in the plug. Its advantages over radial circuits are therefore reduced quantity of copper used, and greater flexibility of appliances and equipment that can be connected.

Ideally, the ring circuit acts like two radial circuits proceeding in opposite directions around the ring, the dividing point between them dependent on the distribution of load in the ring. If the load is evenly split across the two directions, the current in each direction is half of the total, allowing the use of wire with half the total current-carrying capacity. In practice, the load does not always split evenly, so thicker wire is used.

==Description==

The ring starts at the consumer unit (also known as &quot;fuse box&quot;, distribution board, or &quot;breaker box&quot;), visits each socket in turn, and then returns to the consumer unit. The ring is fed from a fuse or circuit breaker in the consumer unit.

Ring circuits are commonly used in British wiring with socket-outlets taking fused plugs to BS 1363. Because the breaker rating is much higher than that of any one socket outlet, the system can only be used with fused plugs or fused appliance outlets. They are generally wired with 2.5 mm2 cable and protected by a 30 A fuse, an older 30 A circuit breaker, or a European harmonised 32 A circuit breaker. Sometimes 4 mm2 cable is used if very long cable runs (to help reduce voltage drop) or derating factors such as very thick thermal insulation are involved. 1.5 mm2 mineral-insulated copper-clad cable (known as &quot;pyro&quot;) may also be used (as mineral insulated cable can withstand heat more effectively than normal PVC) though more care must be taken with regard to voltage drop on longer runs. The protection devices for the fixed wiring need to be rated higher than would protect flexible appliance cords, so BS 1363 requires that all plugs and connection units incorporate fuses appropriate to the appliance cord.

==History and use==
The ring circuit and the associated BS 1363 plug and socket system were developed in Britain during 1942–1947. They are commonly used in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in the Republic of Ireland. They are also found in the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Indonesia and many places where the UK had a strong influence, including for example Cyprus and Uganda.

Pre-World War II practice was to use various sizes of plugs and sockets to suit the current requirement of the appliance, and these were connected to suitably fused radial circuits; the ratings of those fuses were appropriate to protect both the fixed wiring and the flexible cord attached to the plug.

The Electrical Installations Committee which was convened in 1942 as part of the Post War Building Studies programme determined, amongst other things, that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost system which would safely support a greater number of sockets. The scheme was specified to use 13 A socket-outlets and fused plugs; several designs for the plugs and sockets were considered. The design chosen as the British Standard was the flat pin system now known as BS 1363. Other designs of 13 A fused plugs and socket-outlets, notably the Wylex and Dorman &amp; Smith systems, which did not conform to the chosen standard, were used into the 1950s, but by the 1960s BS 1363 had become the single standard for new installations.

The committee mandated the ring circuit both to increase consumer safety and to combat the anticipated post-war copper shortage. The committee estimated that using ring-circuit and single-pole fusing would reduce raw materials requirements by approximately 25% compared with pre-war regulations.

The ring circuit is still the most common mains wiring configuration in the UK, although both 20 A and 30 A radial circuits are also permitted by the Wiring Regulations, with a recommendation based on the floor area served (20 A for area up to 25 m2, 30 A for up to 100 m2).

==Installation rules==

Rules for ring circuits provide that the cable rating must be no less than two thirds of the rating of the protective device. This means that the risk of sustained overloading of the cable can be considered minimal. In practice, however, it is extremely uncommon to encounter a ring with a protective device other than a 30 A fuse, 30 A breaker, or 32 A breaker, and a cable size other than those mentioned above. Because the BS 1363 plug contains a fuse not exceeding 13A, the load at any one point on the ring is limited.

The IET Wiring Regulations (BS 7671) permit an unlimited number of 13A socket outlets (at any point unfused single or double, or any number fused) to be installed on a ring circuit, provided that the floor area served does not exceed 100 m2. In practice, most small and medium houses have one ring circuit per storey, with larger premises having more.

An installation designer may determine if additional circuits are required for areas of high demand. For example, it is common practice to put kitchens on their own ring circuit or sometimes a ring circuit shared with a utility room to avoid putting a heavy load at one point on the main downstairs ring circuit. Since any load on a ring is fed by the ring conductors on either side of it, it is desirable to avoid a concentrated load placed very near the consumer unit, since the shorter conductors will have less resistance and carry a disproportionate share of the load.

Unfused spurs from a ring wired in the same cable as the ring are allowed to run one socket (single or double) or one fused connection unit (FCU). Before 1970 the use of two single sockets on one spur was allowed, but has since been disallowed because of their conversion to double sockets. Spurs may either start from a socket or be joined to the ring cable with a junction box or other approved method of joining cables. BS 1363 compliant triple and larger sockets are always fused at 13A and therefore can also be placed on a spur. Since 1970 it is permitted to have more spurs than sockets on the ring, but it is considered poor practice by many electricians to have too many unfused spurs in a new installation.

Where loads other than BS 1363 sockets are connected to a ring circuit or it is desired to place more than one socket for low power equipment on a spur, a BS 1363 fused connection unit (FCU) is used. In the case of fixed appliances this will be a switched fused connection unit (SFCU) to provide a point of isolation for the appliance, but in other cases such as feeding multiple lighting points (putting lighting on a ring though is generally considered bad practice in new installation but is often done when adding lights to an existing property) or multiple sockets, an unswitched one is often preferable.

Fixed appliances with a power rating of 3 kW or more (for example, water heaters and some electric cookers) or with a non-trivial power demand for long periods (for example, immersion heaters) may be connected to a ring circuit, but it is strongly recommended that instead they are connected to their own dedicated circuit. However, there are plenty of older installations with such loads on a ring circuit.

==Advantages==

Proponents of the ring circuit point out that, when correctly installed, there are also a number of advantages to be considered.

===Area served===
For rooms that are square or circular, a ring circuit can deliver more power per unit of floor area for a given cable size than a simple radial circuit, and the source impedance and therefore voltage drop to the furthest point is lower. Alternatively, to deliver the same power to the same building with radial circuits would require more final circuits or a heavier cable.

===High integrity earthing===
As all fittings on the ring are earthed from both sides, two independent faults are needed to create an &#x27;off earth&#x27; fault.

===Continuous continuity verification from any point===
The continuity of each conductor right round all the points on the ring can be verified from any point, and if this needs to be done as part of live installation monitoring, it can be verified by current clamp injection with the system energised.

==Criticism==
The ring final circuit concept has been criticized in a number of ways compared to radials, and some of these concerns could explain the lack of widespread adoption outside the United Kingdom.

===Fault conditions are not apparent when in use===
Ring circuits may continue to operate without the user being aware of any problem if there are certain types of fault condition or installation errors. This gives both robustness against failure and a potential for danger.
===Safety tests are complex===
At least one author claims that testing ring circuits may take 5–6 times longer than testing radial circuits. The installation tests required for the safe operation of a ring circuit are more time-consuming than those for a radial circuit, and DIY installers or electricians qualified in other countries may not be familiar with them.

===Load balance required===
Regulation 433-02-04 of BS 7671 requires that the installed load must be distributed around the ring such that no part of the cable exceeds its rated capacity. In some cases this requirement is difficult to guarantee, and may be largely ignored in practice, as loads are often co-located (e.g., washing machine, tumble dryer, dish washer all next to kitchen sink) at a point not necessarily near the centre of the ring. However, the fact that the cable rating is 67% that of the circuit breaker, not 50%, means that a ring has to be significantly out of balance to cause a problem.

In a ring circuit, if any poor joint causes a high resistance on one branch of the ring, current will be unevenly distributed, possibly overloading the remaining conductor of the ring.

<text>Paper Lion is a 1966 non-fiction book by American author George Plimpton.

In 1960, Plimpton, not an athlete, arranged to pitch to a lineup of professional baseball players in an All-Star exhibition, presumably to answer the question, &quot;How would the average man off of the street fare in an attempt to compete with the stars of professional sports?&quot; He chronicled this experience in his book, &quot;Out of My League&quot;.

To write &quot;Paper Lion&quot;, Plimpton repeated the experiment in the National Football League, joining the training camp of the 1963 Detroit Lions on the premise of trying out to be the team&#x27;s third-string quarterback. Plimpton, then 36 years old, showed how unlikely it would be for an &quot;average&quot; person to succeed as a professional football player. The book is an expanded version of Plimpton&#x27;s two-part series which appeared in back-to-back issues of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in September 1964. The book&#x27;s epilogue is also an expanded article from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; which appeared one year later.

Plimpton had contacted several teams about his idea including his hometown New York Giants and New York Titans (an American Football League team that would change their name to the New York Jets) and Baltimore Colts. The Lions finally agreed to host Plimpton in their training camp. The coaches were aware of the deception but the players were not until it became apparent that Plimpton did not know how to receive the snap from center. Despite his struggles Plimpton convinced head coach George Wilson to let him take the first five snaps of the annual intra-squad scrimmage conducted in Pontiac, Michigan. Plimpton managed to lose yardage on each play.

Feeling confident he could do better, Plimpton hung around training camp one more week as the team prepared for its first pre-season game against the Cleveland Browns, being sure if the Lions had a big enough lead near the end of the game, Wilson would let him play. However, team officials informed Plimpton at halftime that NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle would not allow him to play under any circumstance. The next day Plimpton packed up and ended his experiment. Before he left, however, the Lions awarded him a gold football that was engraved: &quot;To the best rookie football player in Detroit Lions history.&quot;

The book is memorable as one of the first to showcase the personalities of the players and coaches and what happens off the field. Figuring prominently in the book are linebacker Wayne Walker, quarterback Milt Plum, future Hall of Famers cornerback Dick &quot;Night Train&quot; Lane and middle linebacker Joe Schmidt, and defensive tackle Alex Karras, among others. However, Karras&#x27; inclusion is exclusively through the stories about him told by teammates, coaches and other team personnel. Karras missed the 1963 season serving a suspension for gambling on football games.

Prior to &quot;Paper Lion&quot;, Plimpton had pitched to major league baseball players and sparred with boxing great Archie Moore, but the success of this book, which was later adapted into a 1968 film starring Alan Alda as Plimpton, helped launch a kind of second career for Plimpton as an everyman athlete. Plimpton followed &quot;Paper Lion&quot; with books about golf and ice hockey, as well as two more football books.

In an interview with Tom Bean and Luke Poling, the filmmakers of the documentary, &quot;Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself&quot;, Joe Schmidt talked about how the team reacted to Plimpton&#x27;s presence. &quot;He tried to blend in with the rest of the team, but after a while you could just see that George wasn&#x27;t much of an athlete. You don&#x27;t have to be a Rhodes Scholar to figure that one out. You&#x27;re in training camp and you&#x27;re all pretty good football players, and George comes along, and he&#x27;s sort of emaciated looking, you know he&#x27;s not too physical of a specimen. And he couldn&#x27;t throw the ball more than 15 yards.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Saturday Review&quot; called &quot;Paper Lion&quot; &quot;the best book written about pro football—-maybe about any sport—because Plimpton captures with absolute fidelity how the average fan might feel given the opportunity to try out for a professional football team.&quot;

Stefan Fatsis joined the Denver Broncos as a kicker for preseason training camp in 2006. His story, which has been compared to &quot;Paper Lion&quot;, was told in &quot;A Few Seconds of Panic&quot;.

==&quot;Plimpton! The Great Quarterback Sneak&quot;==
He did a reprise eight years later at age 44 for &quot;Plimpton! The Great Quarterback Sneak&quot;, an hour-long Wolper Productions television special which aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on November 26, 1971. This time around, he worked out with the defending Super Bowl V champion Baltimore Colts in preparation for a preseason game against the Lions in the first-ever professional gridiron contest played at Michigan Stadium on August 22, three months prior to the program&#x27;s airing. His adviser for the project was John Gordy who, along with Alex Karras, was the inspiration for Plimpton&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Mad Ducks and Bears&quot;.

In the Colts&#x27; 23–20 loss to the Lions before a crowd of 91,745, Plimpton was the quarterback for four unofficial plays at the end of the first half which were for the filming of the television special. Wearing uniform number 1, he handed the ball off twice, had a short pass batted down and gained two yards on a quarterback draw before being hit in the ribs by Jim Mitchell and helped to his feet by Karras who had tackled him.

Bill Curry wrote in a September 25, 2003 ESPN.com column that Plimpton won the respect of the Colts players beginning on the first day of training camp by requesting to participate in the nutcracker drill and continuing to take snaps under center despite having dislocated his right thumb. Plimpton also performed all the preseason activities with his teammates and lasted the entire training camp. Curry and Plimpton became longtime friends and coauthors of &quot;One More July&quot; which was released in 1977.

<text>In aviation, aircraft compass turns are turns made in an aircraft using only a magnetic compass for guidance.

==Description==

A magnetic compass aboard an aircraft displays the current magnetic heading of the aircraft, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the aircraft&#x27;s directional orientation relative to the Earth&#x27;s geomagnetic field, which has a roughly north-south orientation. The compass can be used in turns to verify the aircraft is travelling in the desired direction at the conclusion of a turn. The nature of the instrument and the alignment of the magnetic pole of the earth cause the magnetic compass to have several significant limitations when used for navigation. A pilot aware of those limitations can use the compass effectively for navigation. The compass continues to operate despite failures in the electrical, vacuum or pitot static systems.

Compass turns (turns using the magnetic compass as the primary reference instrument) are not standard practice in modern aircraft. Compass turns are typically performed in simulated or actual failures of the directional gyro or other navigational instruments. A magnetic compass is a simple instrument when the compass is not moving and is on the earth. A magnetic compass installed in an aircraft is subject to compass turning errors during flight. Pilots must compensate for such errors when using the magnetic compass.

Most of the errors inherent in the heading indications of a magnetic compass are related to the compass&#x27; construction. An aircraft compass consists of an inverted bowl with a magnetized bar attached. The bowl is balanced on a low friction pin. The bowl and pin assembly is enclosed in a case filled with non-acidic kerosene. The magnetized bar tends to orient the assembly with the local geomagnetic field. The bar turns the visible bowl of the compass. The outside surface of the bowl includes markings to indicate a magnetic heading. As the aircraft (and the compass housing) turns, the bowl remains somewhat stationary with respect to the Earth due to the magnetic attraction. In summary, the aircraft is free to turn around the stationary bowl.

The standard practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is to read the magnetic compass only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight. This reading is then used to set the gyro-stabilized compass. The gyro compass will read correctly in a turn, whereas the magnetic compass can&#x27;t be read properly while turning. Thus the pilot will always ignore the magnetic compass while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.

==Compass errors==

Several types of error will affect the heading indication provided by a magnetic compass if the aircraft is not in steady straight and level unaccelerated flight.

===Pitch limits===

A limitation imposed by a compass&#x27; construction is that the balancing bowl&#x27;s pin, which is connected to a pivot point, only allows, in most compasses, the bowl to tilt by approximately 18 degrees before it will touch the side of the casing. When this happens its freedom to rotate is lost and the compass becomes unreliable.

===Magnetic dip===

A second limitation is magnetic dip. The compass dial will tend to align itself with the geomagnetic field and dip toward the northern magnetic pole when in the northern hemisphere, or toward the southern magnetic pole when in the southern hemisphere. At the equator this error is negligible. As an aircraft flies closer to either pole the dipping error becomes more prevalent to the point that the compass can become unreliable because its pivot point has surpassed its 18 degrees of tilt. Magnetic dip is caused by the downward pull of the magnetic poles and is greatest near the poles themselves. To help negate the effect of this downwards force, the center of gravity of the compass bowl hangs below the pivot. Compass navigation near the polar regions, however, is nearly impossible due to the errors caused by this effect.

When in steady straight and level flight the effect of magnetic dip is of no concern. However, when the aircraft is accelerated or turned to a new heading the following two rules apply:

First, when on an easterly or westerly heading and the aircraft accelerates, the center of gravity of the bowl lags behind the pivot, making it tilt forwards. Because of magnetic dip the compass will show a false turn towards the north if in the northern hemisphere or vice versa a false turn towards the south if in the southern hemisphere. Also if the aircraft is decelerated the compass will show a false turn towards the south in the northern hemisphere and false turn towards the north in the southern hemisphere. The error is neutralized when the aircraft has reached its velocity and the magnetic compass will then read the proper heading. Pilots in the northern hemisphere remember this by the mnemonic &quot;ANDS&quot;: accelerate north, decelerate south. The opposite occurs when flying in the southern hemisphere. This error is eliminated while accelerating or decelerating on a heading of exactly North or exactly South.

Second, when on a northerly heading and a turn towards the east or west is made, the magnet causes the compass to lag behind the actual heading the aircraft is flying through. This lag will slowly diminish as the aircraft approaches either east or west and will be approximately correct when on an east or west heading. When the aircraft turns further towards South, the magnetic compass needle will tend to lead the actual heading of the aircraft. When a turn is made from south to an east or west heading the compass will lead the actual heading the aircraft is flying through, it will diminish as the aircraft approaches either east or west, and it will lag as the aircraft turns further towards North. This happens in a coordinated turn because of the bank of the aircraft and resulting bank of the compass. The North-seeking pole of the magnet is pulled towards the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in the turn. This results in an angular displacement of the compass. The magnitude of the lead/lag will be approximately equal to the aircraft&#x27;s latitude. (An aircraft at 30° north latitude will need to undershoot 30° while turning directly north, and overshoot 30° while turning directly south). This guideline is based not on a standard-rate turn, but on a bank angle of 15°-18°, which would equal a standard rate turn at the airspeeds typical of light aircraft. The pilot community uses the mnemonic UNOS (undershoot North overshoot South) to memorize this rule in the Northern hemisphere. In the Southern hemisphere the mnemonic ONUS is used. Other mnemonics used in the northern hemisphere are NOSE (North Opposite, South Exaggerates), OSUN (Overshoot South, Undershoot North), and South Leads, North Lags. These are reversed in the Southern hemisphere.

==Standard-rate compass turns==

Standard rate turn is a standardized rate at which the aircraft will make a 360 degree turn in two minutes (120 seconds). Standard rate turn is indicated on turn coordinator or turn-slip indicator.

All turns during flights under instrument rules shall be made at standard turn rate, but no more than 30 degrees of bank. In case of vacuum-driven instruments failure (i.e. directional gyro, attitude indicator) the rollout to new heading is timed: let&#x27;s say the aircraft is flying 060 degrees heading and it needs to fly new heading 360. The turn will be 60 degrees. Since the standard rate turn is 360 degrees in 120 seconds, the plane will need 20-second standard rate turn to the left.

In case of electrical instrument failure, which include turn coordinator or turn-slip indicator, the following formula will help to determine turn bank at which the turn will be made at standard rate: In order to calculate bank angle for a standard rate turn knowledge of airspeed must be known. The rule of thumb using airspeed requires that the last digit of the airspeed be dropped then add five. For example, if the airspeed is 90 knots, the bank angle would be (9+5=) 14 degrees. For 122 knots, it would be (12+5=) 17 degrees. The line of latitude is the maximum lead or lag a compass will have.

The following explanations are for the northern hemisphere.

For example, an aircraft flying at 45°N latitude making a turn to north from east or west maintaining a standard rate turn a pilot would need to roll out of the turn when the compass was 45 degrees plus one half of the bank angle before north. (From east to north at 90 knots 0+45+7=52) A pilot would begin to roll out to straight flight and on a heading of north when 52 degrees was read from the compass. (From west to north at 90 knots (360-45-7=308). A pilot would begin to roll the aircraft out of the bank at 308 degrees read from the compass to fly on a north heading. Making a turn towards south from west the pilot would have to roll the aircraft out of the turn when the compass was 45 degrees minus half the bank angle (from west to south at 90 knots 180-45+7=142, from east to south 180+45-7=218).

From the examples we see that when turning to north from east or west the bank angle used to calculate the time to roll the plane out of the turn must begin at the greatest number of degrees or further away from north. Conversely for turns to south from east or west the bank angle is calculated to decrease the number of degrees to lead the roll out or closer to south.

Generally pilots will practice making these turns using half standard rate turns. This will decrease the bank angle so that it is half of the calculated bank angle. When turns are made at half standard rate the line of latitude will only cause the compass to have an error of half as much. So our new calculation using a half standard rate turn is as follows: (From east to north at 90 knots 0+22.5+3.5=26) the lead roll out heading read from the compass would be 26 degrees to fly on a north heading. (From west to north 360-22.5-3.5=334) The lead roll out heading read off the compass would be 334 degrees.

Turns made for other directions should be interpolated. For example, a left turn made from a heading of west to south east (SE). The compass would initially show a heading that is correct as the turn gets closer to south the compass would indicate a lead heading of the greatest error, as the aircraft passes through south the error would decrease and show less of a lead. As the aircraft approaches south east the error would only lead half as much as it did when the aircraft was rolling through south. So if the turn was made using a half standard rate at 90 knots and the SE heading required to fly was 135 degrees the roll out heading would be 135-11.25+3.5=127 degrees. Hence a roll out heading read from the compass of 127 degrees would be used to actually fly the heading of 135 degrees.

<text>Anders Hovden (April 6, 1860 – November 26, 1943) was a Norwegian Lutheran clergyman, hymnwriter poet and author.

==Education and career==
Anders Karlsen Hovden was born in Ørsta Municipality in Romsdalen county, Norway. His parents were Karl Rasmussen Hovden and Johanne Andersdatter Velle. His father died when he was 16, but fellow Ørsta native Ivar Aasen helped him get an education: first the teachers&#x27; training college in Volda, then examen artium at the University of Oslo. Hovden became cand.theol. in 1886 and then worked some years as a teacher. From 1891 he was a Lutheran minister in a number of different places in Norway: Lista Municipality, Son Municipality, Sande Municipality, Vanse Municipality, Krødsherad Municipality, Melhus Municipality and Østre Toten Municipality.

==Hymnwriter==
Hovden was the author of over 250 hymns. He debuted in the mid-1890s with a couple of poetry collections, however, it was in 1897 with his third collection, &quot;Tungalda&quot; that he received popular acclaim in wider circles. His breakthrough came in 1901 with the poetry cycle &quot;Bonden&quot;. He was also on the revision board for &quot;Landstads kirkesalmebog&quot; which was the main hymnal for the Church of Norway prior to 1926. From 1928, he was co-editor the Norwegian hymnal, &quot;Nynorsk salmebok&quot;, which contained 23 original hymns by Anders Hovden and 16 translations from nynorsk. Most notable among his compositions was the Norwegian national hymn &quot;Fagert er landet&quot; (&quot;Fair is the country&quot;). He retired from his ministry in 1931.

==Author==
Hovden also wrote a number of books, of which his autobiography &quot;Attersyn&quot; (1926) is best known. He also wrote &quot;Per Sivle – ei livssoge&quot; (1905), the first biography of Norwegian poet and novelist, Per Sivle. Published one year after his death, it contributed to the then obscure Sivle&#x27;s increasing national popularity.

==Personal life==
Anders Hovden was married twice and was the father of ten children. His first wife Lina Marie Devold (1865–1895), died after only four years of marriage and the birth of two children. Two years later Hovden married with Kari Huglen (1879–1963). They had eight children together.

<text>John Thomas Watson Bacot (1821–1888) was a New Zealand politician in the Auckland Region.

==Biography==
Bacot arrived in New Zealand in June 1848 to take up a position as Medical Officer to the Pensioner Settlements, having previously served as an Assistant Surveyor in the British army in India. He retired to England in 1858.

He was a member of New Zealand&#x27;s 1st Parliament, representing the Pensioner Settlements from 1853 to 1855, when he was defeated.

The Pensioner Settlements electorate consisted of the Auckland suburbs of Howick, Onehunga, Ōtāhuhu, and Panmure.

<text>Maralal is a small hillside market town in northern Kenya, lying east of the Loroghi Plateau within Samburu County, of which it is the capital. It is the administrative headquarters of Samburu County. The town had an urban population of 31,350 (2019 census). The market was pioneered by Somali settlers in the 1920s.

==Main sights==
Approximately 2 km southwest of the town are the remains of the Maralal National Sanctuary. This nature site, closed by the Samburu County Government in September 2014, has now largely been absorbed into the town and the wildlife has been eradicated by poachers. Encroachment began from the south as villages expanded, so causing the natural wildlife corridors to be closed.

Maralal is also home to Kenyatta House, where Jomo Kenyatta was detained prior to his release. This rather unassuming modern house has a significant place in the history of modern Kenya.

Until 2016, the town hosted the Maralal International Camel Derby, but this has ceased to function primarily due to the outcry by foreign tourists objecting to the abuse of the animals used. Tourist activities in Maralal have slowed and the town is mostly a base for adventurous travellers heading to Lake Turkana, some 12 hours travel by road to the north.

Accommodation is cheap and lacks any sophistication, but improved roads heading to Maralal from the south should be completed by 2019, at which time tourism opportunities might improve. The closest airport is Kisima Airport, located in the nearby village of Kisima.

==Transport==
The main road to Maralal starts from Gilgil and passes through Nyahururu and Rumuruti and ends in Baragoi. The entire stretch up to Maralal is tarmac, but is unpaved past that. The President of Kenya also launched work on the paved Naibor–Kisima–Maralal road in July 2017.

<doc id="974247" wikidata="Q667830" url="?curid=974247" title="Auschwitz Album">
<text>The Auschwitz Album is a photographic record of the Holocaust during the Second World War. It and the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; photographs are among the small number of visual documents that show the operations of Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the German extermination camp in occupied Poland.

Originally titled &quot;Resettlement of the Jews from Hungary&quot; (&quot;Umsiedlung der Juden aus Ungarn&quot;), it shows a period when the Nazis accelerated their deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The images were taken by photographers from the camp&#x27;s Erkennungsdienst (&quot;identification service&quot;). Among other things, the Erkennungsdienst was responsible for fingerprinting and taking photo IDs of prisoners who had not been selected for extermination. The identity of the photographers is uncertain, but it is thought to have been Bernhard Walter or Ernst Hoffmann, two SS men who were director and deputy director of the Erkennungsdienst. The camp&#x27;s director, Rudolf Höss, also may have taken several of the photographs himself. 

The album has 56 pages and 193 photographs. Originally, it had more photographs, but before being donated to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Israel, some of them were given to survivors who recognized relatives and friends.

==Description==
The images follow the processing of newly arrived Hungarian Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia in the spring and summer of 1944. They document the disembarkation of the Jewish prisoners from the train boxcars, followed by the selection process, performed by doctors of the SS and wardens of the camp, which separated those who were considered fit for work from those who were to be sent to the gas chambers. The photographers followed groups of those selected for work, and those selected for death, to a birch grove just outside the crematoria, where they were made to wait before being killed. The photographers also documented the workings of the &quot;Canada&quot; storage facilities, where the looted belongings of the prisoners were sorted before transport to Germany. The photographs are unrepresentative in showing the arrival process during the daytime; the vast majority of transports were timed to arrive at the camp during the night.

== Purpose and intended audience ==
The album was likely produced to show the efficient operations of Auschwitz to an audience of high-level Nazi officials. The goal can be inferred from the album&#x27;s contents, which focus on the processing of Hungarian Jews upon their arrival at the camp. The photographs were taken at a time when Eichmann accelerated the deportation of Hungarian Jews, with 650,000 people to be transported to Auschwitz in the course of three months. Rudolf Höss had been deployed to Auschwitz in May 1944 to oversee the operation, and the album highlights his management of the arrival process. The album has therefore been interpreted by scholars as an example of &quot;internal propaganda&quot; meant to show the orderly operation of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;.

==History==
The album&#x27;s survival is remarkable, given the strenuous efforts made by the Nazis to keep the &quot;Final Solution&quot; a secret. Also remarkable is the story of its discovery. Lili Jacob (later Lili Jacob-Zelmanovic Meier) was selected for work at Auschwitz-Birkenau, while the other members of her family were sent to the gas chambers. After the Auschwitz camp was evacuated by the Nazis as the Soviet army approached, Jacob passed through various camps, finally arriving at the Dora concentration camp, where she was eventually liberated. Recovering from illness in a vacated barracks of the SS, Jacob found the album in a cupboard beside her bed. Inside, she found pictures of herself, her relatives, and others from her community. The coincidence was astounding, given that the Nordhausen-Dora camp was over away, and that over 1,100,000 people were killed at Auschwitz.

The album&#x27;s existence had been known publicly since at least the 1960s, when it was used as evidence at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials. Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld visited Lili in 1980 and convinced her to donate the album to Yad Vashem. The album&#x27;s contents were first published that year in the book &quot;The Auschwitz Album&quot;, edited by Klarsfeld.

<text>Matt Feazell (born 1955) is an American cartoonist from Hamtramck, Michigan, primarily working in minicomics. He is best known for his wryly humorous &quot;The Amazing Cynicalman&quot; series and the simple &quot;stick figure&quot; art style he uses for it. Cynicalman appears in the introduction to Scott McCloud&#x27;s book &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;, in which Feazell&#x27;s work is cited as an example of &quot;iconic&quot; art taken to its greatest degree.

== Early life and education ==
Feazell was born in Ames, Iowa. In high school he experimented with stick-figure comics, but also developed a more traditional comics style. Feazell&#x27;s comics influences included Jack Kirby, Hank Ketcham, and Will Eisner.

He received his B.S. in Community/Fine Arts from Southern Illinois University.

== Career ==
In addition to self-publishing &quot;Cynicalman&quot;, Feazell&#x27;s work has been published by Aardvark-Vanaheim, AC Comics, Arrow Comics, Caliber Press, Fictioneer Books, Last Gasp, NBM Publishing, Eclipse Comics, and First Comics. Steeldragon Press published his series &quot;Ant-Boy&quot; from 1986 to 1988. From 2004 to 2007, he was also a regular contributor to &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine with his strip &quot;Dizzy Adventures.&quot;

A regular on the small press comics festival scene, he has appeared at multiple local comic-cons throughout the Midwest.

===The Amazing Cynicalman===
In the 1980s Feazell produced short pieces entitled &quot;The Adventures of Zot! in Dimension 10½&quot; which appeared as backup stories in issues of Scott McCloud&#x27;s series &quot;Zot!&quot;.

In 1987, Feazell created a stick figure character named Cynicalman. Asked about the character&#x27;s name, Feazell explained that he &quot;was having a bad day.&quot; Discussing his choice to draw stick figures, he described them as &quot;art (that&#x27;s) so simple – it verges on calligraphy,&quot; and added that thin characters let him condense more information into panels. He also expressed hope that stick figures would inspire people to draw their own comics, advising, &quot;Don&#x27;t try to fool people into thinking that you&#x27;re a great artist. Draw what you want to draw. Discover the comic within you – just draw that.&quot;

Cynicalman and his supporting cast (including Antisocialman, CuteGirl, and StupidBoy) have been featured in Feazell&#x27;s minicomics, and in a weekly newspaper strip carried in a few Michigan papers from 1997 to 2002. Some of his work has been collected in paperbacks entitled &quot;Cynicalman, The Paperback&quot; (1987, minicomics material), &quot;ERT! Not Available Comics&quot; (1995, minicomics), and &quot;The Amazing Cynicalman&quot; (the newspaper strip). A weekly color strip, &quot;Cynicalman, America&#x27;s Laid-Off Superhero&quot;, ran on Serializer.net.

Feazell has made a graphic novel called &quot;The Death of Antisocialman&quot; featuring Antisocialman and multiple characters from the Cynicalman comics. There are 12 chapters in the novel series, all of which are available on Feazell&#x27;s site.

In 2012, Feazell released &quot;The Amazing Cynicalman&quot;, a feature-length film he wrote and directed, based on his comics work.

<doc id="974260" wikidata="Q2701827" url="?curid=974260" title="Africa Star">
<text>The Africa Star is a military campaign medal, instituted by the United Kingdom on 8 July 1943 for award to British and Commonwealth forces who served in North Africa between 10 June 1940 and 12 May 1943 during the Second World War.

Three clasps were instituted to be worn on the medal ribbon: North Africa 1942–43, 8th Army and 1st Army.

==The Second World War Stars==
On 8 July 1943, the Star (later named the Star) and the Africa Star became the first two campaign stars instituted, and by May 1945 a total of eight stars and nine clasps had been established by the United Kingdom to reward campaign service during the Second World War. One more campaign star, the Arctic Star, and one more clasp, the Bomber Command Clasp, were belatedly added on 26 February 2013, more than sixty-seven years after the end of the war.

Including the Arctic Star and the Bomber Command clasp, no-one could be awarded more than six campaign stars, with five of the ten clasps awarded denoting service that would have qualified for a second star. Only one clasp could be worn on any one campaign star. The maximum of six possible stars are the following:

* The 1939–1945 Star with, when awarded, either the Battle of Britain or the Bomber Command clasp.
* Only one of the Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star or France and Germany Star. Those earning more than one received the first qualified for, with the second denoted by the appropriate ribbon clasp.
* The Arctic Star.
* The Africa Star with, if awarded, the first earned of clasps for North Africa 1942–43, 8th Army or 1st Army.
* Either the Pacific Star or Burma Star. Those earning both received the first qualified for, with the appropriate clasp to represent the second.
* The Italy Star.

All recipients of campaign stars also received the War Medal.

==Institution==
Between 10 June 1940 and 12 May 1943 British forces fought in North Africa against the Germans and Italians, who had control of large areas of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and therefore threatened the Suez Canal and the approaching sea lanes. During the desert conflict the balance of power alternated between the two sides, until the remaining German forces surrendered at Tunis on 12 May 1943. Some historians consider the victory over the German forces in North Africa to have been the turning point in the war which led to the eventual defeat of Germany.

The institution of the Africa Star was announced on 8 July 1943 and in August it was announced that the first uniform ribbon bars would be issued to qualifying personnel later in that year. The medals themselves were not intended to be available until after the cessation of hostilities. Some ribbon issues to overseas troops were delayed, but many had been received by the end of 1943. By March 1944 1,500,000 personnel had received Africa Star ribbon bars, with further awards made by the end of the war.

Three clasps were instituted: &#x27;North Africa 1942–43&#x27;, &#x27;8th Army&#x27; and &#x27;1st Army&#x27;, of which only the first to be earned may be worn on the ribbon of the Africa Star.

==Award criteria==
===Medal===
The Africa Star was awarded for a minimum of one day&#x27;s service in an operational area of North Africa between 10 June 1940 and 12 May 1943. The operational area includes the whole of the area between the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, together with Malta, Ethiopian Empire, Kenya, the Sudan, both Somalilands and Eritrea. Areas not bordering on the Mediterranean only qualified for the Africa Star between 10 June 1940 and 27 November 1941 inclusive.
* Royal Navy and Merchant Navy personnel qualified for the award of the Africa Star through service in the Mediterranean between these two dates, or for service in the campaigns in Abyssinia, Somaliland and Eritrea between 10 June 1940 and 27 September 1941. Merchant Navy personnel also qualified with service in operations off the Moroccan coast between 8 November 1942 and 12 May 1943. For sea-going service there was no condition that the 1939-45 Star should already have been earned before the Africa Star could be awarded.
* Army personnel had to enter North Africa on the establishment of an operational unit, while service in Abyssinia, Sudan, Somaliland and Eritrea also qualified.
* Air Force personnel had to land in or have flown over any of the operational areas. The Africa Star was also awarded to crews of transport aircraft that flew over certain specified routes.
* Members of the Australian Imperial Force qualified for the award of the Africa Star for service in Syria between 8 June and 11 July 1941.

Service in West Africa did not qualify for the award of the Africa Star.

===Clasps===
Regulations issued in 1945 only allow one clasp, the first one qualified for, to be worn with the Africa Star. Despite this, both the 8th Army and 1st Army clasps were awarded to and worn by, inter alia, General Dwight Eisenhower and Field Marshal Harold Alexander.
* The North Africa 1942–43 Clasp was awarded for service with the 18th Army Group Headquarters between 15 February 1942 and 12 February 1943 inclusive, for Navy and Merchant Navy personnel in shore service, or for Air Force service in specified areas from 23 October 1942 to 12 May 1943 inclusive. In undress, a silver rosette worn on the ribbon bar denotes the award of this clasp.
* The 8th Army Clasp was awarded for service with the Eighth Army between 23 October 1942 and 12 May 1943 inclusive. An Arabic numeral &quot;8&quot; is worn on the ribbon bar in undress to denote the award of this clasp.
* The 1st Army Clasp was awarded for service with the First Army between 8 November 1942 and 12 May 1943 inclusive. An Arabic numeral &quot;1&quot; is worn on the ribbon bar in undress to denote the award of this clasp.

==Description==
The set of nine campaign stars was designed by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender that passes through an eyelet formed above the uppermost point of the star. They are six–pointed stars, struck in yellow copper zinc alloy to fit into a 44 millimetres diameter circle, with a maximum width of 38 millimetres and 50 millimetres high from the bottom point of the star to the top of the eyelet.

;Obverse
The obverse has a central design of the Royal Cypher &quot;GRI VI&quot;, surmounted by a crown. A circlet, the top of which is covered by the crown, surrounds the cypher and is inscribed &quot;THE AFRICA STAR&quot;.

;Reverse
The reverse is plain.
;Naming
The British Honours Committee decided that Second World War campaign medals awarded to British forces would be issued unnamed, a policy applied by all but three British Commonwealth countries. The recipient&#x27;s name was impressed on the reverse of the stars awarded to Indians, South Africans and, after a campaign led by veteran organisations, to Australians. In the case of Indians, naming consisted of the recipient&#x27;s force number, rank, initials, surname and service arm or corps, and in the case of South Africans of the force number, initials and surname, in block capitals.

;Clasps

All three clasps were struck in yellow copper zinc alloy and have a frame with an inside edge that resembles the perforated edge of a postage stamp. They are inscribed &quot;NORTH AFRICA 1942–43&quot;, &quot;8th ARMY&quot; and &quot;1st ARMY&quot; respectively and were designed to be sewn onto the medal&#x27;s ribbon. Regulations only allow one clasp, the first earned, to be worn with the Star. When the ribbon is worn alone, a silver Arabic numeral &quot;8&quot;, numeral &quot;1&quot; or rosette is worn on the ribbon bar to denote the award of the respective clasp.

;Ribbon
The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with a 5 millimetres wide pale buff band, a 1½ millimetres wide Navy blue band, a 5 millimetres wide pale buff band, a 9 millimetres wide Army red band, a 5 millimetres wide pale buff band, a 1½ millimetres wide Air Force blue band and a 5 millimetres wide pale buff band. The pale buff represents the sand of the Sahara Desert while the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy, the Armies and the Air Forces are represented by the dark blue, red and light blue bands respectively.

The ribbons for this medal and the Defence Medal as well as those of the other Second World War campaign stars, with the exception of the Arctic Star, were devised by King George VI.

==Order of wear==
The order of wear of the Second World War campaign stars was determined by their respective campaign start dates and by the campaign&#x27;s duration. This is the order worn, even when a recipient qualified for them in a different order. The Defence Medal and War Medal are worn after the stars. The Canadian Volunteer Service Medal is worn after the Defence Medal and before the War Medal, with other Commonwealth war medals worn after the War Medal.
* The 1939–1945 Star, from 3 September 1939 to 2 September 1945, the full duration of the Second World War.
* The Atlantic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Battle of the Atlantic and the War in Europe.
* The Arctic Star, from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, the duration of the Arctic Convoys and the War in Europe.
* The Air Crew Europe Star, from 3 September 1939 to 5 June 1944, the period until D-Day minus one.
* The Africa Star, from 10 June 1940 to 12 May 1943, the duration of the North African Campaign.
* The Pacific Star, from 8 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Pacific War.
* The Burma Star, from 11 December 1941 to 2 September 1945, the duration of the Burma Campaign.

<doc id="974271" wikidata="Q5988073" url="?curid=974271" title="Ideas Have Consequences">
<text>Ideas Have Consequences is a philosophical work by Richard M. Weaver, published in 1948 by the University of Chicago Press. The book is largely a treatise on the harmful effects of nominalism on Western civilization since this doctrine gained prominence in the Late Middle Ages, followed by a prescription of a course of action through which Weaver believes the West might be rescued from its decline.

==Epistemology and approach==

Weaver rejects the notion that the axioms underlying a human belief system can be arbitrary exercises of ultimate choice not anchored in objective realities without that system declining and ultimately failing. Accordingly, Weaver attacks nominalism using historical analogy and the teleological implications, or &quot;consequences&quot; of such a world view.

It is important, however, to distinguish this approach from that of historicism, which contends that history unfolds in deterministic cycles. Weaver emphasizes his position that the cause of apparent patterns in the decline of civilizations is the recurring replacement of &quot;an ontological division [of the cosmos] by categories&quot; with &quot;a study of signification ... [in which the] words no longer correspond to objective realities.&quot;

==The decline of the West==

Weaver attributes the beginning of the Western decline to the adoption of nominalism (or the rejection of the notion of absolute truth) in the late Scholastic period. The chief proponent of this philosophical revolution was William of Ockham.

The consequences of this revolution, Weaver contends, were the gradual erosion of the notions of distinction and hierarchy, and the subsequent enfeebling of the Western mind&#x27;s capacity to reason. These effects in turn produced all manner of societal ills, decimating Western art, education and morality.

As examples of the most recent and extreme consequences of this revolution, Weaver offers the cruelty of the Hiroshima bombing, the meaninglessness of modern art, America&#x27;s cynicism and apathy in the face of the just war against Nazism, and the rise of what he terms &quot;The Great Stereopticon&quot;.

==The Great Stereopticon==

Weaver gives the name &quot;The Great Stereopticon&quot; to what he perceives as a rising, emergent construct which serves to manipulate the beliefs and emotions of the populace, and ultimately to separate them from their humanity via &quot;the commodification of truth&quot;.

Here, notably, Weaver echoes the sentiments of C. S. Lewis in his book &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; (which was written nearly contemporaneously with &quot;Ideas Have Consequences&quot;), and anticipates the modern critique of consumerism.

==Prescription==
Weaver concludes his book by proposing that deliberate measures might be taken to begin the regeneration of Western civilization. Among these, he proposes that language be reinvested with value, and that the right to private property, which he dubs &quot;the last metaphysical right&quot;, be maintained, among other things because it provides a material basis for human sustenance and thus furnishes an individual (as it did Henry David Thoreau) with the means to be independent from a corrupt system.

==Chapters summary==
Chapter 1: The Unsentimental Sentiment
Every man in a culture has three levels of conscious reflection: his specific ideas about things, his general beliefs, and his metaphysical dream. The first constitutes his worldliness, the second is applied to certain choices as they present themselves and the third which is the most important is his intuitive feeling about the immanent nature of reality. Without this it is impossible to live together harmoniously for prolonged amounts of time. It is also his attitude toward the world and is the most important fact about a person.

Logic depends upon this dream, for the waning of the dream results in the confusion of counsel. Today many think that it does not matter what a man believes, but it does. What a man believes tells him what the world is for. If people can’t agree what the world is for, they can never agree on all the little things in life either. People don’t want others to take what they believe too seriously. This is how religion is currently viewed. Our various thoughts and assumptions about ideas are what give them meaning. Our ideas must be harmonized by some vision. Our task is to find that harmonization.

Chapter 2: Distinction and Hierarchy
The most ominous event of our time is that people are steadily doing away with the distinctions which themselves create society. The preservation of society is directly linked with the recovery of knowledge. Society has structure and hierarchy which is determined by distinctions. People are becoming more and more overcome with the idea that in a just society there are no distinctions and everyone is equal. But people are engaged in self-promotion, contradicting that there are no distinctions. How can there be equality between sexes and ages? The basis of an organic society is a fraternity which unites parts that are distinct. Democracy presumes hierarchy and discrimination. Authority goes to knowledge.

Chapter 3: Fragmentation and Obsession
Our culture has lost many values and those who want to restore those values are often told that they are trying to regress or turn back the hands of time. Values though are not affected by time and thus can be re-attained through the right process. In looking for values we are looking for truth. We have lost sight of true knowledge. Our leaders have come in three stages. The first was the philosophic doctor. He was the best, for he was the possessor of the highest learning. At the point of this ruler there was a great interest in Humanities and Liberal arts. Next came the gentleman. He was the second best. He was an Idealist with self- restraint . His only shortcoming was that he had lost sight of the spiritual origin of self-discipline. In this time ideals existed and Ideals are of supreme importance. Last and worst was the specialist. He ignored all circles of knowledge except a particular field in which he immersed himself. In this time men are lost without their particular fields of experience. Men are partially developed which means essentially that they are deformed. Deformed people are the last one who should be rulers. Fact has taken the place of truth. Authority is flawed and not to be trusted.

Chapter 4: Egotism in Work and Art
Egotism is making one’s self the measure of value. One such man does not need to obey the laws of other men and can do what he will with his life. This sort of thinking leads inevitably into selfishness. Plato said that such a man would judge himself wrongly and choose his own interest over the truth. To the medieval man the path of learning was a path of self-deprecation; and knowledge prepared the way for self-effacement. The basis for internal pride is the seeking of a sort of salvation through knowledge. There is no necessity in the absence of truth. One type of fidelity is realizing an ideal. According to an egotistic mindset, the less communal programs in order to ensure self-inspired demands, the better. When divine laws are ignored and everything is seen to be man’s contrivance, the egotistic man will try to claw his way to the top of society. Some seek this sort of salvation through forms and so escape responsibilities. When disciplines are disregarded he tries to avoid responsibilities by claiming some sort of &quot;progress&quot;. The failure to maintain internal discipline in a leader is followed by a rationalized single powerful will.

Chapter 5: The Great Stereopticon
Those below the level of philosophy are ones to make the first effort to repair the damage. But their efforts have no effect because they attempt the repair by a physical means. Disintegration brings about, for our leaders, a problem of how to persuade to communal activity people who no longer have the same ideas about the most fundamental things. There can be no reconciliation between authority and individual will. The solution these leaders chose was to replace religion with education which was a systematic indoctrination through channels of information and entertainment. In comes the Great Stereopticon. This machine serves the function of projecting selected pictures of life in the hope that they will be imitated. It is today a machine of three parts, having been progressively improved. The three parts are: The Press, The Motion Picture, and The Radio. It is an ideal servant of progress. The problem with this machine is that the data it gives takes its significance from a sickly metaphysical dream. The ultimate source of evaluation becomes the dream of psychopathic, fragmentation, disharmony, and nonbeing. &quot;The Great Stereopticon keeps the ordinary citizen from perceiving ’the vanity of his bookkeeping and the emptiness of his domestic felicities.’&quot;

Chapter 6: The Spoiled-Child Psychology
The author realizes, &quot;HAVING been taught for four centuries, more or less, that his redemption lies through the conquest of nature, man expects his heaven to be spatial and temporal, and, beholding all things through the Great Stereopticon, he expects redemption to be easy of attainment. Only by these facts can we explain the spoiled-child psychology of the urban masses.&quot; The author notes, &quot;[H]e has received concessions at enough points to think that he may obtain what he wishes through complaints and demands.&quot;
And concerning the determinant confrontation with the Soviet Ease, the author writes, &quot;Thus a great decision confronting the West in the future is how to overcome the spoiled-child psychology sufficiently to discipline for struggle.&quot; And he concludes, &quot;In the final analysis this society is like the spoiled child in its incapacity to think. Anyone can observe in the pampered children of the rich a kind of irresponsibility of the mental process.&quot;

Chapter 7: The Last Metaphysical Right
This chapter, and those following, is about means of restoration, i.e., remedies. &quot;A primary object of those who wish to restore society is the demassing of the masses, and in this the role of property is paramount.&quot; The author explains the title, &quot;We say the right of private property is metaphysical because it does not depend on any test of social usefulness.&quot; And then he warns against the gravity of the situation, &quot;It is not a little disquieting to realize that in private property there survives the last domain of privacy of any kind.&quot;
And if we choose to know and will, then &quot;The moral solution is the distributive ownership of small properties. These take the form of independent farms, of local businesses, of homes owned by the occupants, where individual responsibility gives significance to prerogative over property. Such ownership provides a range of volition through which one can be a complete person, and it is the abridgment of this volition for which monopoly capitalism must be condemned along with communism.&quot; 

Chapter 8: The Power of the Word
The author introduces the message of the chapter by a reference to Saint John. He writes, &quot;The central teaching of the New Testament is that those who accept the word acquire wisdom&quot;. The main argument here is the critique of modern semanticists. He observes, &quot;In recognizing that words have power to define and to compel, the semanticists are actually testifying to the philosophic quality of language which is the source of their vexation.&quot; And then he goes on to identify two dangerous phenomena: The attack upon the symbolic operations of language and the decay of honorifics (in forms of address!) 
The author declares that he is &quot;ready to assert that we can never break out of the circle of language and seize the object barehanded, as it were, or without some ideational operation.&quot; Which is why &quot;It is difficult, therefore, to overrate the importance of skill in language.&quot; And, &quot;Poetry offers the fairest hope of restoring our lost unity of mind.&quot; In conclusion, the author suggests, &quot;Since man necessarily uses both the poetical and the logical resources of speech, he needs a twofold training. The first part must be devoted to literature and rhetoric, the second to logic and dialectic.&quot;

Chapter 9: Piety and Justice
&quot;Piety is a discipline of the will through respect. It admits the right to exist of things larger than the ego, of things different from the ego. And, before we can bring harmony back […] we shall have to regard with the spirit of piety three things: nature, our neighbors—by which I mean all other people—and the past.&quot; 
Regarding nature, the author warns, &quot;Triumphs against the natural order of living exact unforeseen payments… Our planet is falling victim to a rigorism, so that what is done in any remote corner affects—nay, menaces—the whole. Resiliency and tolerance are lost.&quot; Regarding neighbors, &quot;Knowledge disciplines egotism so that one credits the reality of other selves… But to have enough imagination to see into other lives and enough piety to realize that their existence is a part of beneficent creation is the very foundation of human community.&quot; And regarding the past, &quot;in so far as we are creatures of reflection, we have only the past… Awareness of the past is an antidote to both egotism and shallow optimism.&quot; Toward the conclusion, and concerning women, the author affirms, &quot;once again equality destroys fraternity&quot;. Restoration comes at a price, &quot;Yet it is the duty of those who can foresee the end of a saturnalia to make their counsel known.&quot;

<text>Eirik Verås Larsen (born 26 March 1976 in Flekkefjord) is a Norwegian sprint kayaker who has competed internationally since the early 1990s. He has participated in three Summer Olympics, and has won a complete set of medals (gold: 2004 K-1 1000 m and 2012 K-1 1000 m, silver: 2008 K-1 1000 m, bronze: 2004 K-2 1000 m).

Eirik Verås Larsen&#x27;s definitive international breakthrough came when he and his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim won the European Championship K2-1000 gold medal in 2000.

==Early career==
Verås Larsen started kayaking at the age of 10 in Flekkefjord, a small town at the south west coast with 8000 inhabitants. Flekkefjord Kayak Club had a history of producing world champions – such as his coach Olaf Søyland who won gold medals in K4-10 000m in 1975 and in the K2-1000m in 1979.

As a young competitive athlete at the national level, Verås Larsen was never the top-ranked contender. However, he was known as being dedicated, hard working, and he was feared by many for his endurance capacity. By the end of his teenage years, his hard work started to pay off. At just 17-year-old, he surprised many by winning the bronze medal in the 1993 Nordic Marathon Junior Championship in Sweden.

In 1995, Verås Larsen moved to Oslo to train alongside Norway&#x27;s best paddlers. For several years, he trained in the group led by Knut Holman, the dominant force in the men&#x27;s K1-1000 meter throughout the 1990s, boasting three olympic gold medals and five times world championship titles.

==International breakthrough==
Eirik Verås Larsen&#x27;s definitive international breakthrough came when he and his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim won the European Championship K2-1000 gold medal in 2000 in Poznań, Poland. The achievement resulted in a wild-card from the International Canoe Federation for participation in the Sydney Olympics the same year, where they placed 9th on K2-1000.

==The golden years – European-, World Champion==
In 2001, Verås Larsen won his first World Champion gold medal. He and Nils Olav Fjeldheim were superior to the other teams in the K2-1000 final in Poznań, Poland. From 2002, he went for combining K1-1000 and K2-1000. Although the K2 continued to perform very well, it was his K1 achievements that would dominate the coming years of his career. He won World Champion Gold medals in K1-1000 in 2002 and 2005.

In 2006, he was not in top shape and won no international titles. His best results were 5th on K1-500 in the European Championships, and 6th on K1-1000 in the World Championships. This wake-up call may well have turned out to sharpen his focus towards the 2008 Olympics for which he was a clear gold candidate. After a disappointing 2006 he was back on track in 2007 and won the Gold medal on K1-1000 at the European Championships, and he finished 3rd in the World Championships later the same year.

Before the 2009 season, Verås Larsen decided to go for K2 with Jacob Norenberg, and did not race internationally in K1. Together they won the 2009 European Championships at K2-1000 in Germany and finished 5th in the World Championships in Halifax later the same year.
Verås Larsen held the individual (K-1) 1000m world record of 3:24.920 (Duisburg 2004) until it was bettered by Ben Fouhy of New Zealand (Poznań 2006) with the time of 3:24.495 (backwind of 2 m/s).

==Olympic Champion==
The number one milestone of his career came in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Over a few years he had tried to combine K2-1000m, K1-1000m and K1-500m. This was a major challenge as the event racing times were very close in the championship time schedules. In Athens he won gold medal in K1-1000, followed by an impressive bronze medal in K2-1000 one hour later. He also finished 4th at K1-500.

There was some uncertainty around his fitness level in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Since 2005 his best result in the World Championships was 3rd in 2007. He came to Beijing with a 6th place in K2-1000 (with Mattis Næss) as his best result from the European Championships, not having participated in K1-1000. In Beijing he won a silver medal at K1-1000 meter only beaten by Tim Brabants (GBR), and claimed that he was very happy as he had done his best race since 2004. He completed a great season by finishing 4th in the Olympic K1-500.
He earned his second gold of Olympics in 2012 London Olympics in Canoe Sprint&#x27;s Kayak Single (K1) 1000m event.

==Marathon canoeing==
In 2001 and 2002 Verås Larsen won the K2 marathon World Championships together with his companion Nils Olav Fjeldheim.

==Step down and comeback==
After the 2009 season Verås Larsen decided that he would not race in 2010. He had attained his goals with several gold medals in both the Olympics and in World Championships, and needed time to decide whether he would go for another Olympics.

On 18 August 2010 a Norwegian newspaper broke the news that Verås Larsen was ready for a comeback, aiming for another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

In his first international World Cup competition in the comeback season 2011 he finished 2nd on K1-1000m (Poznań, Poland).

==Personal life==
In 2011 he married Mira Verås Larsen, who also competed as a kayaker in the 2012 Olympics.

==Education==
Eirik Verås Larsen holds a MSc in biomechanics from the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences.

<doc id="974280" wikidata="Q15521469" url="?curid=974280" title="Hugh Carleton">
<text>Hugh Francis Carleton (3 July 1810 – 14 July 1890) was New Zealand&#x27;s first member of parliament.

==Early life==
Carleton was born in 1810. He was the son of Francis Carleton (1780–1870) and Charlotte Margaretta Molyneux-Montgomerie (d. 1874). Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton was the brother of his grandfather, John Carleton. His family was living in Clare, County Tipperary and then Greenfield, County Cork, Ireland. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law in London, then art in Italy.

==Career as a journalist in New Zealand==
He settled in the Bay of Islands in 1842. On 30 November 1859, he married Lydia Jane Williams, youngest daughter of the missionary Henry Williams and Marianne Williams; they had no children.

He became a journalist in Auckland and edited the &quot;New Zealander&quot; then established the &quot;Anglo-Maori Warder&quot;, which followed an editorial policy in opposition to Governor George Grey. In 1856 he became the editor of the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

==Career as a member of parliament==


He was a member of New Zealand&#x27;s first, second, third, and fourth Parliaments, representing the electorate from 1853 to 1870, when he was defeated. Due to the system of staggering used in the first general election, Carleton was actually the first MP ever elected in New Zealand (though he was elected unopposed), hence he liked to be called the Father of the House.

Carleton was the second Chairman of Committees, succeeding Frederick Merriman on 17 April 1856, i.e. just after the opening of the first session of the 2nd Parliament. He remained Chairman of Committees until he left Parliament in 1870.

He had a strong interest in parliamentary procedure, and unsuccessfully lobbied for the position of Speaker. He is known for his unsuccessful campaign against the availability of alcoholic beverages at Bellamy&#x27;s, the parliamentary restaurant. He was also a critic of the idea that all voting districts should contain the same number of voters, saying that this system gave &quot;a preponderating control&quot; of the political world to one specific class. He was described as &quot;scholarly&quot; by his allies and &quot;pedantic&quot; by his critics.

==England==
Carleton returned to England and spent the last ten years of his life there. He died at Lewisham, Surrey, England, on 14 July 1890.

His wife Lydia died in Napier, New Zealand on 28 November 1891.

<doc id="974284" wikidata="Q1648484" url="?curid=974284" title="Duchenne muscular dystrophy">
<text>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy predominantly affecting boys. The onset of muscle weakness typically begins around age four, with rapid progression. Initially, muscle loss occurs in the thighs and pelvis, extending to the arms, which can lead to difficulties in standing up. By the age of 12, most individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are unable to walk. Affected muscles may appear larger due to an increase in fat content, and scoliosis is common. Some individuals may experience intellectual disability, and females carrying a single copy of the mutated gene may show mild symptoms.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations or deletions in any of the 79 exons encoding the large dystrophin protein, which is essential for maintaining the muscle fibers&#x27; cell membrane integrity. The disorder follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, with approximately two-thirds of cases inherited from the mother and one-third resulting from a new mutation. Diagnosis can frequently be made at birth through genetic testing, and elevated creatine kinase levels in the blood are indicative of the condition.
While there is no known cure, management strategies such as physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may alleviate symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Several drugs designed to address the root cause are currently available including gene therapy (Elevidys), and antisense drugs (Ataluren, Eteplirsen etc.). Other medications used include glucocorticoids (Deflazacort, Vamorolone); calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem); to slow skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and Histone deacetylase inhibitors (Givinostat) to delay damage to dying muscle cells.
Various figures of the occurrence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy are reported. One source reports that it affects about one in 3,500 to 6,000 males at birth in the U.S., (or 17 to 29 per 100,000 U.S. male births). Another source reports Duchenne muscular dystrophy being a rare disease and having an occurrence of 7.1 per 100,000 male births globally. A number of sources referenced in this article indicate an occurrence of 6 per 100,000.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common type of muscular dystrophy, with a median life expectancy of 27–31 years. However, with comprehensive care, some individuals may live into their 30s or 40s. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is considerably rarer in females, occurring in approximately one in 50,000,000 live female births.

==Signs and symptoms==
Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive muscle weakness due to muscle fiber disarray, death, and replacement with connective tissue or fat. The voluntary muscles are affected first, especially those of the hips, pelvic area, thighs, calves. It eventually progresses to the shoulders and neck, followed by arms, respiratory muscles, and other areas. Fatigue is common.
Signs usually appear before age five, and may even be observed when a boy takes his first steps. There is general difficulty with motor skills, which can result in an awkward manner of walking, stepping, or running. They tend to walk on their toes, in part due to shortening of the Achilles tendon, and because it compensates for knee extensor weakness. Falls can be frequent. It becomes increasingly difficult for the boy to walk. The ability to walk usually disintegrates completely before age 13. Most men affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy become essentially &quot;paralyzed from the neck down&quot; by the age of 21. Cardiomyopathy, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, is common, seen in half of 18-year-olds. The development of congestive heart failure or arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) is only occasional. In late stages of the disease, respiratory impairment and swallowing impairment can occur, which can result in pneumonia.

A classic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is trouble getting up from a lying or sitting position, as manifested by a positive Gowers&#x27;s sign. When a child tries to rise from lying on his stomach, he compensates for pelvic muscle weakness through the use of the upper extremities: first by rising to stand on his arms and knees, and then &quot;walking&quot; his hands up his legs to stand upright. Another characteristic sign of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is pseudohypertrophy (enlarging) of the muscles of the tongue, calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5). Fat and connective tissue eventually replace the muscle tissue, hence the term pseudohypertrophy. Muscle fiber deformities and muscle contractures of Achilles tendon and hamstrings can occur, which impair functionality because the muscle fibers shorten and fibrose in connective tissue. Skeletal deformities can occur, such as lumbar hyperlordosis, scoliosis, anterior pelvic tilt, and chest deformities. Lumbar hyperlordosis is thought to be a compensatory mechanism in response to gluteal and quadriceps muscle weakness, all of which cause altered posture and gait (e.g.: restricted hip extension).
Non-musculoskeletal manifestations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy occur. There is a higher risk of neurobehavioral disorders (e.g., ADHD), learning disorders (dyslexia), and non-progressive weaknesses in specific cognitive skills (in particular short-term verbal memory), which are believed to be the result of inadequate dystrophin in the brain.

==Cause==

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (locus Xp21) that codes for dystrophin protein. Mutations can either be inherited or occur spontaneously during germline transmission, causing a large reduction or absence of dystrophin, a protein that provides structural integrity in muscle cells. Dystrophin is responsible for connecting the actin cytoskeleton of each muscle fiber to the underlying basal lamina (extracellular matrix), through a protein complex containing many subunits. The absence of dystrophin permits excess calcium to penetrate the sarcolemma (the muscle cell membrane).

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is extremely rare in females (about 1 in 50,000,000 female births). It can occur in females with an affected father and a carrier mother, in those who are missing an X chromosome, or in those who have an inactivated X chromosome (the most common of the rare reasons). The daughter of a carrier mother and an affected father will be affected or a carrier with equal probability, as she will always inherit the affected X-chromosome from her father and has a 50% chance of also inheriting the affected X-chromosome from her mother.

Disruption of the blood–brain barrier has been seen to be a noted feature in the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

== Diagnosis ==
Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be detected with about 95% accuracy by genetic studies performed during pregnancy.

===DNA test===
The muscle-specific isoform of the dystrophin gene is composed of 79 exons, and DNA testing (blood test) and analysis can usually identify the specific type of mutation of the exon or exons that are affected. DNA testing confirms the diagnosis in most cases.

===Muscle biopsy===
If DNA testing fails to find the mutation, a muscle biopsy test may be performed. A small sample of muscle tissue is extracted using a biopsy needle. The key tests performed on the biopsy sample for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting for dystrophin, and should be interpreted by an experienced neuromuscular pathologist. These tests provide information on the presence or absence of the protein. Absence of the protein is a positive test for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Where dystrophin is present, the tests indicate the amount and molecular size of dystrophin, helping to distinguish Duchenne muscular dystrophy from milder dystrophinopathy phenotypes. Over the past several years, DNA tests have been developed that detect more of the many mutations that cause the condition, and muscle biopsy is not required as often to confirm the presence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

===Prenatal tests===
A prenatal test can be considered when the mother is a known or suspected carrier.

Before invasive testing, determination of the fetal sex is important; while males are sometimes affected by this X-linked disease, female Duchenne muscular dystrophy is extremely rare. This can be achieved by ultrasound scan at 16 weeks or more recently by free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) can be done at 11–14 weeks and has a 1% risk of miscarriage. Amniocentesis can be done after 15 weeks and has a 0.5% risk of miscarriage. Non invasive prenatal testing can be done around 10–12 weeks. Another option in the case of unclear genetic test results is fetal muscle biopsy.

==Treatment==

No cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is known.

Treatment is generally aimed at controlling symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured using specific questionnaires, and include:
* Corticosteroids such as prednisolone, deflazacort, and Vamorolone (Agamree) lead to short-term improvements in muscle strength and function up to 2 years. Corticosteroids have also been reported to help prolong walking, though the evidence for this is not robust.
* Disease-specific physical therapy helps maintain muscle strength, flexibility, and function. It aims to:
** Minimize the development of contractures and deformity by developing a program of stretches and exercises where appropriate
** Anticipate and minimize other secondary complications of physical nature by recommending bracing and durable medical equipment
** Monitor respiratory function and advise on techniques to assist with breathing exercises and methods of clearing secretions
* Orthopedic appliances (such as braces and wheelchairs) may improve mobility and the ability for self-care. Form-fitting removable leg braces that hold the ankle in place during sleep can defer the onset of contractures.
* Appropriate respiratory support as the disease progresses is important.
* Cardiac problems may require a pacemaker.

The medication eteplirsen, a Morpholino antisense oligo, has been approved in the United States for the treatment of mutations amenable to dystrophin exon 51 skipping. The US approval has been controversial as eteplirsen failed to establish a clinical benefit; it has been refused approval by the European Medicines Agency.

The medication ataluren (Translarna) is approved for use in the European Union.

The antisense oligonucleotide golodirsen (Vyondys 53) was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019, for the treatment of cases that can benefit from skipping exon 53 of the dystrophin transcript.

The Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide viltolarsen (Viltepso) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in people who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. Developed by Nippon Shinyaku and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), viltolarsen&#x27;s pre-clinical development was supported by pioneering work from Toshifumi Yokota and colleagues. It is the second approved targeted treatment for people with this type of mutation in the United States. Approximately 8% of people with DMD have a mutation that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.

Casimersen (Amondys 45) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2021, and it is the first FDA-approved targeted treatment for people who have a confirmed mutation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping.

Comprehensive multidisciplinary care guidelines for Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were published in 2010. An update was published in 2018.

Delandistrogene moxeparvovec (Elevidys) is a gene therapy that in June 2023 received United States FDA accelerated approval for the treatment of four and five-year-old children.

In October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vamorolone (Agamree) as a Treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals holds the exclusive North American license and commercial rights.

In March 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved givinostat (Duvyzat), an oral medication, to be used in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in people aged six years and older. Givinostat is the first nonsteroidal drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of all genetic variants of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Functioning as a histone deacetylase (Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, givinostat operates by targeting pathogenic processes within the body, ultimately leading to a reduction in inflammation and muscle loss associated with the disease.

==Prognosis==
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare progressive disease that eventually affects all voluntary muscles and involves the heart and breathing muscles in later stages. Life expectancy is estimated to be around 25–26, but this varies. People born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy after 1990 have a median life expectancy of approximately 28–30. With excellent medical care, affected men often live into their 30s. The oldest surviving person in the world with the disease is 60 years old.

The most common direct cause of death in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is respiratory failure. Complications from treatment, such as mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy procedures, are also a concern. The next leading cause of death is cardiac-related conditions such as heart failure brought on by dilated cardiomyopathy. With respiratory assistance, the median survival age can reach up to 40. In rare cases, people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been seen to survive into their forties or early fifties, with proper positioning in wheelchairs and beds, and the use of ventilator support (via tracheostomy or mouthpiece), airway clearance, and heart medications. Early planning of the required supports for later-life care has shown greater longevity for people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Curiously, in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the lack of dystrophin is associated with increased calcium levels and skeletal muscle myonecrosis. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) are protected and do not undergo myonecrosis. ILMs have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties. In addition, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy also have elevated plasma lipoprotein levels, implying a primary state of dyslipidemia in patients.

==Epidemiology==
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common type of muscular dystrophy; it affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Duchenne muscular dystrophy has an incidence of one in 3,600 male infants.

In the US, a 2010 study showed a higher amount of those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy age ranging from 5 to 54 who are Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks.

==History==

The disease was first described by the Neapolitan physician Giovanni Semmola in 1834 and Gaetano Conte in 1836. However, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is named after the French neurologist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne (1806–1875), who in the 1861 edition of his book &quot;Paraplégie hypertrophique de l&#x27;enfance de cause cérébrale&quot;, described and detailed the case of a boy who had this condition. A year later, he presented photos of his patient in his &quot;Album de photographies pathologiques&quot;. In 1868, he gave an account of 13 other affected children. Duchenne was the first to do a biopsy to obtain tissue from a living patient for microscopic examination.

==Society and culture==
As of 2023, the US states Ohio and New York require newborns to be screened for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As of 2024, Minnesota requires newborn screening.

=== Notable cases ===
* Alfredo Ferrari was an Italian automotive engineer, the eldest son of automaker Enzo Ferrari, and the planned heir to his father&#x27;s sports car company, Ferrari. Alfredo died of DMD on 30 June 1956 at the age of 24.
* Rapper and disability rights advocate Darius Weems had the disease and used his notoriety to raise awareness and funds for treatment, as seen in the documentary &quot;Darius Goes West&quot; (2007). He died at the age of 27 in 2016.
* Jonathan Evison&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving&quot;, published in 2012, depicted a young man affected by the disease. In 2016, Netflix released &quot;The Fundamentals of Caring&quot;, a film based on the novel.
* In 2024, Netflix released a documentary film about a young man with the disease, &quot;The Remarkable Life of Ibelin&quot;. The film explores the life of Mats Steen and the impact he had on his World of Warcraft guild &quot;Starlight&quot;, where Mats spent much of his time.

==Research==

Efforts are ongoing to find medications that either return the ability to make dystrophin or utrophin. Other efforts include trying to block the entry of calcium ions into muscle cells.

===Exon-skipping===

Antisense oligonucleotides (oligos), structural analogs of DNA, are the basis of a potential treatment for 10% of people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The compounds allow faulty parts of the dystrophin gene to be skipped when it is transcribed to RNA for protein production, permitting a still-truncated but more functional version of the protein to be produced. It is also known as nonsense suppression therapy.

Two kinds of antisense oligos, 2&#x27;-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligos (like Drisapersen) and Morpholino oligos (like eteplirsen), have tentative evidence of benefit and are being studied. Eteplirsen is targeted to skip exon 51. &quot;As an example, skipping exon 51 restores the reading frame of ~ 15% of all the boys with deletions. It has been suggested that by having 10 AONs to skip 10 different exons it would be possible to deal with more than 70% of all DMD boys with deletions.&quot; This represents about 1.5% of cases.

People with Becker&#x27;s muscular dystrophy, which is milder than DMD, have a form of dystrophin that is functional even though it is shorter than normal dystrophin. In 1990 England &quot;et al.&quot; noticed that a patient with mild Becker muscular dystrophy was lacking 46% of his coding region for dystrophin. This functional, yet truncated, form of dystrophin gave rise to the notion that shorter dystrophin can still be therapeutically beneficial. Concurrently, Kole &quot;et al.&quot; had modified splicing by targeting pre-mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). Kole demonstrated success using splice-targeted AONs to correct missplicing in cells removed from beta-thalassemia patients Wilton&#x27;s group tested exon skipping for muscular dystrophy.

===Gene therapy===
Researchers are working on a gene editing method to correct a mutation that leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Researchers used a technique called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, which can precisely remove a mutation in the dystrophin gene in DNA, allowing the body&#x27;s DNA repair mechanisms to replace it with a normal copy of the gene.

Genome editing through the CRISPR/Cas9 system is not currently feasible in humans. However, it may be possible, through advancements in technology, to use this technique to develop therapies for DMD in the future. In 2007, researchers did the world&#x27;s first clinical (viral-mediated) gene therapy trial for Duchenne MD.

Biostrophin is a delivery vector for gene therapy in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy.

=== Future developments ===

Several medications designed to address the root cause are under development, including gene therapy and antisense drugs. Other medications used include corticosteroids to slow muscle degeneration. Physical therapy, orthopedic braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms while assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder.

In February 2024, the results of a 48-week trial with Vamorolone in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (The VISION-DMD study) were published. Patients showed improvements in motor outcomes seen with 6 mg/kg/d of Vamorolone at 24 weeks of treatment and were maintained for 48 weeks of treatment. As well, bone morbidities of prednisone (stunting of growth and declines in serum bone biomarkers) were reversed when treatment transitioned to Vamorolone.

<text>DC Shoes, Inc. is an American brand specializes in footwear for action sports such as skateboarding and snowboarding. The company also manufactures apparel, bags, accessories, hats, t-shirts, and posters.

==History==
DC was founded in June 1994 by Damon Way, Ken Block and Clayton Blehm. It was originally based in Carlsbad, California, but is now based in Huntington Beach, California. DC originally stood for &quot;Droors Clothing,&quot; but since the sale of Droors Clothing in 2004, DC no longer has ties to Droors and is simply DC Shoes, Inc.

On March 8, 2004, DC Shoes was acquired by Quiksilver in an $87 million transaction. In 2010, DC Shoes moved from Vista, California, to Quiksilver&#x27;s headquarters in Huntington Beach.
A video entitled &quot;Skateboarding Is Forever&quot; was released online in 2010 and featured skateboarders Marquise Henry, Matt Miller, Wes Kremer, Evan Smith, and Greg Myers. Apart from Myers and Henry, all of the skateboarders from the video remained sponsored by the company in 2013, and have since attained professional status.

In 2011, the brand underwent a rejuvenation process that included the design of a new flag logo. As part of this process, new skateboard team announcements were progressively made and a series of advertisements, under the direction of new team member Steve Berra, were released online. The other new team announcements were Mikey Taylor, Mike Mo Capaldi, Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, and Davis Torgerson. Felipe Gustavo was introduced at a later stage.

A progression of the brand relaunch was the &quot;Rediscovery&quot; campaign that commenced in December 2011, following the addition of Capaldi and Huston to the skateboard team. 

Co-founder Block died in a snowmobile crash in January 2023.

<doc id="974294" wikidata="Q943328" url="?curid=974294" title="If You're Feeling Sinister">
<text>If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister is the second album by the Scottish indie pop band Belle and Sebastian. It was released in 1996 on Jeepster Records in the United Kingdom and in 1997 by Matador Records in the United States. It is often ranked among the best albums of the 1990s, including being ranked No. 4 in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1990s&quot;.

Band leader Stuart Murdoch said &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; is probably his best collection of songs. In 2005, Belle and Sebastian released a live version, &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister: Live at the Barbican.&quot;

==Background and recording==
Belle and Sebastian released their debut studio album &quot;Tigermilk&quot; in mid-1996 on local label Electric Honey. By July 1996, the band received praise by radio DJs, and by August 1996, they got attention from interested record labels. They ultimately signed with London-based label Jeepster Records.

Jeepster was willing to accept some of the group&#x27;s other demands, such as releasing no singles, not doing press or promotional events, and not appearing in promotional materials.

At this point, Stuart Murdoch and drummer Richard Colburn had taken up residence in a flat above Hyndland Parish Church in Glasgow, where Stuart was a caretaker, with the band using the church&#x27;s hall as their rehearsal space. They began rehearsing new material, written by Murdoch, after signing with Jeepster. The album took five days to record and three to mix, slightly longer than &quot;Tigermilk&quot;. It was recorded in the same studio as &quot;Tigermilk&quot; and engineer Tony Doogan worked with the band&#x27;s previous engineer to maintain a similar recording style. Band member Sarah Martin, who had recently joined the band at this point, likened &quot;Tigermilk&quot; and &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; to The Beatles&#x27; albums &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; in the sense that the two albums were recorded quickly after one another.

Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), described the album&#x27;s sound as: &quot;Blessed with vocals straight out of Donovan&#x27;s &#x27;60s, and a musical echo of vintage Boomtown Rats, topped off by a West coast vibe tinged with unbridled Scots romanticism&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; thought the band sounded like a mix of Beat Happening and Tindersticks.

==Release==
&quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; was released in November 1996, which Belle and Sebastian promoted with shows alongside Tindersticks. It was issued in the United States in early 1997; the decision to do this delayed the follow-up, with the band instead opting to release three EPs, &quot;Dog on Wheels&quot;, &quot;Lazy Line Painter Jane&quot; and &quot;3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light&quot; (all 1997). The EPs were successively climbing the charts in the UK while &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; was gaining traction at American colleges. The band made their live debut in the US in September 1997, appearing at the CMJ Festival.

The cover photo was taken by Murdoch of his friend, Ciara MacLaverty; like Murdoch, MacLaverty suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. It features a copy of The Trial by Franz Kafka.

==Critical reception==

&quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; received critical acclaim. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 14 in its top 100 albums of the 1990s. Later, the readers of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; voted the album the 31st greatest album released between 1996 and 2011. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; featured the album at number 75 on its list of &quot;100 Best Albums of the Nineties,&quot; while &quot;Spin&quot; included the record at number 59 on its &quot;125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years&quot; list. &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; also appears as an entry in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; as chosen by music critics. The album was placed at number 8 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop annual critics&#x27; poll for 1997. Alternative music website &quot;Melophobe&quot; called the album the 6th best indie rock album of all time. The album was ranked No. 481 of the Top 500 Albums of All Time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2020.

In 2007, as part of the &quot;33⅓&quot; series, Scott Plagenhoef wrote a book about the album.

In February 2013, Pitchfork.tv released an hour-long documentary about the album directed by RJ Bentler. For the documentary, every band member who played on the album was interviewed. It featured archive photographs and videos from the band&#x27;s early days.

Reflecting on it 20 years on, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breihan claimed that &quot;Sinister&quot; could be &quot;&quot;too&quot; influential&quot;, despite it taking &quot;a long time for [the band&#x27;s] influence to spread.&quot; In time, their impact would &quot;fully sink into the bloodstream of the indie rock world.&quot; He saw the band&#x27;s timidity taken, &quot;Americanized&quot;, and introduced to a new audience in US college kids by American band Death Cab for Cutie. He also credited them with impacting the development of &quot;sensitive and proudly bookish&quot; indie stars like the Decemberists and Sufjan Stevens. Other groups that critics have noted &quot;Sinister&quot; inspiring include Alvvays, Hovvdy, Kings of Convenience, and the Shins.

<text>The Rialto is a central area of Venice, Italy, in the &quot;sestiere&quot; of San Polo. It is, and has been for many centuries, the financial and commercial heart of the city. Rialto is known for its prominent markets as well as for the monumental Rialto Bridge across the Grand Canal.

==History==
The area was settled by the ninth century, when a small area in the middle of the Realtine Islands on either side of the Rio Businiacus was known as the , or &quot;high bank&quot;. Eventually the Businiacus became known as the Grand Canal, and the district the Rialto, referring only to the area on the left bank.

The Rialto became an important district in 1097, when Venice&#x27;s market moved there, and in the following century a boat bridge was set up across the Grand Canal providing access to it. This was soon replaced by the Rialto Bridge.

The market grew, both as a retail and as a wholesale market. Warehouses were built, including the famous Fondaco dei Tedeschi on the other side of the bridge. Meanwhile, shops selling luxury goods, banks on Rialto Square and insurance agencies appeared and the city&#x27;s tax offices were located in the area. The city&#x27;s abattoir was also in the Rialto.

Most of the buildings in the Rialto were destroyed in a fire in 1514, the sole survivor being the church San Giacomo di Rialto, while the rest of the area was gradually rebuilt. The Fabriche Vechie dates from this period, while the Fabbriche Nuove is only slightly more recent, dating from 1553. The statue Il Gobbo di Rialto was also sculpted in the sixteenth century.

The Rialto is mentioned in works of literature, notably in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, where Salanio asks &quot;What news on the Rialto?&quot; at the opening of Act III, Scene I. In &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot; Sonnet 19, Elizabeth Barrett Browning writes that &quot;The soul&#x27;s Rialto hath its merchandise...&quot;.

==Markets==
The area is still a busy retail quarter, with the daily Erberia greengrocer market, and the fish market on the Campo della Pescheria. A huge variety of fish and seafood is available in the fish market including shellfish, squids, cuttlefish, giant tiger prawns, mullets, eels, crabs, octopuses and lobsters.

==In media==
* Television
** Rick Steves has made episodes about Venice for his travel documentary program, Rick Steves&#x27; Europe, in which he discusses the Rialto and other landmarks.
* Video games
** Rialto is featured in the 2012 game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a playable map.

<text>Racer X was an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1985. The group went through a hiatus and a few lineup changes, with bassist Juan Alderete being the sole constant member. They were signed to Shrapnel Records.

==History==
===1980s===
Guitarist Paul Gilbert first gained notoriety when he was featured in Mike Varney&#x27;s Spotlight Column in the February 1983 issue of Guitar Player magazine. Gilbert was 16 years old and was living in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He later moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at the Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT), part of the Musicians Institute. After graduating from GIT, Gilbert was hired as an instructor and recorded the album &quot;Trouble in the Streets&quot; with Los Angeles metal band Black Sheep, released on Enigma Records in November 1985.
While at GIT, Gilbert met fellow student Juan Alderete. Searching for a drummer, Alderete and Gilbert first turned to Scott Travis, who was living in Virginia at the time, but he turned down the offer due to his commitment to the band Hawk. Travis was receiving a salary from Doug Marks, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, and would not turn down the income. Alderete and Gilbert instead sought the services of fellow student Harry Gschoesser. After acquiring Gschoesser, Gilbert, with the help of Varney, recruited Jeff Martin of the Phoenix metal band Surgical Steel. Martin, who still lived in Phoenix and could not regularly write songs with Racer X in Los Angeles, began writing lyrics immediately for demo tapes that Gilbert had sent him. Recording for their first album began quickly. The band began the recording process in 1985, and Racer X&#x27;s debut album &quot;Street Lethal&quot; was released on January 1, 1986, on Mike Varney&#x27;s Shrapnel Records label.

====Popularity boost====
With the release of &quot;Street Lethal&quot;, Paul Gilbert suddenly burst into the mainstream as one of the members of the Neoclassical genre, popularized by Randy Rhoads and Yngwie J. Malmsteen. While Racer X was not playing neo-classical pieces as frequently as Rhoads or Malmsteen, Gilbert was often mentioned alongside Malmsteen and Rhoads in many guitar and music magazines. Gilbert acknowledged his debt to Malmsteen on the &quot;Street Lethal&quot; album with the neoclassical instrumental &quot;Y.R.O.&quot;. The title is an acronym for &quot;Yngwie Rip Off&quot;. He would repeat such a reference on a later song, &quot;B.R.O.&quot;, which stands for &quot;Bach Rip Off&quot;.

Racer X was rapidly becoming a popular live act on the Sunset Strip. Around this time, Gilbert secured an endorsement deal with Ibanez guitars, which continues to this day. The song &quot;Getaway&quot; received limited airplay on Los Angeles&#x27; heavy metal radio station, KNAC.

====Lineup change====
After the release of the first album, Gilbert was still teaching at GIT for a steady income. One of Gilbert&#x27;s students, Bruce Bouillet, gained his attention. Gilbert asked him to join Racer X, and the two guitarists would soon work out synchronized harmony passages that would redefine Racer X&#x27;s sound. In 1986, Racer X&#x27;s drummer Harry Gschoesser&#x27;s visa expired, so he returned to his native country, Austria. He was initially replaced with Todd &quot;Vito&quot; DeVito, who had played on Black Sheep&#x27;s &quot;Trouble In The Streets&quot; LP alongside Gilbert, but was soon replaced by Scott Travis. DeVito went on to become a drum technician for Mikkey Dee of Motörhead.

The band headed to Prairie Sun Studios in Cotati to record their second studio album. &quot;Second Heat&quot; was released in February 1987 by Shrapnel Records, and solidified Racer X&#x27;s style of double-lead guitar solos using techniques such as fast alternate-picking, two-handed tapping, string skipping, and sweep picking. The album also has two tracks written by other artists. &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; was a David Bowie cover, and &quot;Heart of a Lion&quot; was a Judas Priest song dropped from the &quot;Turbo&quot; album. The song was a birthday gift by Rob Halford, who had befriended Jeff Martin in the band&#x27;s early days. Halford later recorded the track with his band, Halford.

====Dissolution====
While the Los Angeles music scene was at the peak for glam metal, Racer X were reaching the height of their popularity with their live shows. The band was selling out and packing their usual rotation of The Roxy Theatre, Troubadour, and the Country Club in Reseda, California. The years of unsuccessfully searching for major label representation finally took its toll on the band, and the group&#x27;s last gasp came with two nights of back-to-back live shows at the Country Club, which were recorded and released as &quot;Extreme Volume Live&quot; (1988) and &quot;Extreme Volume II Live&quot; (1992). But even as &quot;Live Extreme, Vol. 1&quot; was getting ready for release, the dismantling of the band was near. Billy Sheehan, bass player of the band Talas, approached Paul Gilbert about forming a new band; in mid 1989, the two formed the band Mr. Big. Gilbert had mentally detached himself from Racer X during the final shows. The rest of the group, searching for an explanation to the lack of major label interest, focused their frustrations on Jeff Martin. Both Gilbert and Martin left the band on the same day. Juan Alderete, Bruce Bouillet, and Scott Travis initially brought in Guitar Spotlight player Chris Arvan in 1989 as a replacement and performed a few shows, including one with Oni Logan from Lynch Mob. Soon, the members of the band went separate ways. Racer X&#x27;s hiatus carried on well into the late 1990s.

===1990s===
====Separation====
After Gilbert left for Mr. Big, other members also went on to other projects. Jeff Martin formed a short-lived outfit named Bad Dog with drummer Todd DeVito and former War &amp; Peace and future Fight and Steel Panther guitarist Russ Parrish; the latter had also been part of Electric Fence, a side project featuring Martin and Paul Gilbert. Martin eventually went on to replace Eric Singer in Jake E. Lee&#x27;s band, Badlands. After the demise of the final Racer X line-up, with former Roxanne vocalist Jamie Brown briefly taking over for Martin, Juan Alderete, Bruce Bouillet, and Scott Travis teamed up with former Angora vocalist John Corabi to form the band Black Cloud – which would later become The Scream. The four played one show at the Troubadour before Travis received an offer from Judas Priest, who were looking to replace the recently departed Dave Holland. Jeff Martin, a friend of Judas Priest, relayed the message to Travis, who was ecstatic at the opportunity, and accepted the offer. Travis would go on to record several albums with Judas Priest, and remains a member of the band to this day.

In 1992, Shrapnel Records released &quot;Extreme Volume II Live&quot;, which featured songs from the farewell Racer X concerts at the Country Club. Like the first live record, it included several previously unreleased songs, like &quot;Poison Eyes&quot; and &quot;Give it to Me&quot;. The release gave die-hard Racer X fans hope that new material was on the way, but nothing came to fruition. The one most notable track is Racer X&#x27;s cover of KISS&#x27; &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. Recording the song, Gilbert and Bouillet, wanting to make the song unique and fitting to their style, stood side by side and played the famous solo with their teeth. One other KISS song was played the night before, &quot;Cold Gin&quot;, but it never appeared on either of the first two live releases.

====&quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;====
In 1999, Racer X released their third studio album, entitled &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;. The album soon became one of the band&#x27;s most successful to date. Many recognizable songs such as the album cover namesake and instrumental &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;. Other songs such as fan-favorite &quot;Miss Mistreater&quot; and &quot;Snakebite&quot; are most thought of off the album.

====Reemergence====
After departing Mr. Big in 1997 after the recording of the &quot;Hey Man&quot; album, Gilbert started a solo career releasing &quot;King of Clubs&quot;. Paul received an email from a man in Australia bashing him with anger, the famous &quot;Snakebyte&quot; email. In the email he chastised Paul for the more pop-oriented music on his solo records and accused him of forgetting his shred metal roots. Paul was apparently inspired to record heavy metal and decided to reform Racer X. Gilbert was joined by every original member except Bruce Bouillet, who did not choose to return. In mid-1999, the band recorded &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;. The album went gold in Japan, and Racer X&#x27;s new record label requested a follow-up. In late 2000, the band released what is recognized by many fans as their best album to date, &quot;Superheroes&quot;. The album&#x27;s packaging featured pictures of the band members dressed as superheroes. Gilbert became the Electric Bat, Martin became Motorman, Alderete became The X-tinguisher, and Travis became Cowboy Axe. The record was mixed by former Racer X guitarist, Bruce Bouillet. In order to further capitalize on their new-found success in Japan, Universal Japan requested that the band record a live show for another live CD and DVD. On May 25, 2001, the band played their first live performance in thirteen years at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The show was recorded for both audio and video, and in 2002, both the CD and DVD were released under the name &quot;Snowball of Doom&quot;, which is a reference to fact that the band is still &quot;rolling along&quot; after fifteen years, but was still unable to secure a major American record label contract.

====&quot;Getting Heavier&quot;====
In January 2002, in support of &quot;Superheroes&quot; and &quot;Snowball of Doom&quot;, Racer X toured Japan and Taiwan. The band performed these shows in their &quot;Superheroes&quot; costumes. For the final show, in Yokohama, the performance was hastily recorded in two tracks on the sound board, and this was later released as &quot;Snowball of Doom 2&quot;.

Gilbert returned to his solo career, recording the album &quot;Burning Organ&quot;. However, in 2002, Universal Japan pushed for another Racer X release, notifying the band that they would release an official bootleg of the Yokohama concert to promote a new album. In October 2002, all four members of Racer X gathered at Gilbert&#x27;s house in Las Vegas to record a new album. For the first time in the history of the band all four members were together at the same time to record a Racer X album. The outcome of the recording was &quot;Getting Heavier&quot;, which was sold alongside &quot;Snowball of Doom 2&quot; in a package deal.

After the release of &quot;Getting Heavier&quot;, Racer X&#x27;s progress came to a halt. Scott Travis, with Judas Priest, toured with Ozzfest in 2004 and recorded &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;. Jeff Martin began recording and touring with George Lynch, Kevin DuBrow, Michael Schenker, recorded a 3-song demo with the band Leatherwolf, and began a solo career with the release of &quot;The Fool&quot; in 2006. Juan Alderete joined the band The Mars Volta in 2003, which has toured regularly and recorded several albums. Paul Gilbert has released several solo albums, as well as compilation albums and tours with Dream Theater&#x27;s previous drummer Mike Portnoy. Gilbert has toured with his supporting band in support of his latest albums.

====&quot;Reunion&quot;====
Racer X performed at the 2009 NAMM Show at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California (the performance actually took place at the Sheraton Park Hotel ballroom next to the convention center), with a line-up consisting of Paul Gilbert, Scott Travis, Jeff Martin, and Juan Alderete. On October 13, 2009, the video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; was released. The game&#x27;s soundtrack featured two Racer X songs: &quot;Y.R.O.&quot; from &quot;Street Lethal&quot; and &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot; from &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot;. In 2020, bassist Juan Alderete got into a cycling accident. In support of him, Paul Gilbert finished and released an outtake from the &quot;Technical Difficulties&quot; sessions: a cover of the Partridge Family song &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;, the first Racer X song in 18 years.

In 2024, Martin and Gschoesser would form the band Lethal X, whose debut album &quot;90 Tons of Thunder&quot; featured Gilbert as a guest musician on several tracks.
