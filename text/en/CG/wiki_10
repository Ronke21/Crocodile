*&quot;Le Rétablissement de la Pologne&quot; (1863)
His magnum opus was his &quot;Histoire de Napoleon I&quot; (5 vols., 1867–1875 and 1886; Eng. trans., 4 vols, 1871–1879), which ceased at the end of 1811 with the preparations for the Russian campaign of 1812. This book, based on the emperor&#x27;s correspondence published in 1858-1870, attempted the destruction of the legends which had grown up around his subject, and sought by a critical examination of the documents to explain the motives of his policy.

In his desire to refute current misconceptions and exaggerations of Napoleon&#x27;s abilities, Lanfrey unduly minimized his military and administrative genius. A staunch republican, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1871, became ambassador at Bern (1871-1813), and life senator in 1875. He died at Pau on the 15 November 1877.

<text>Mocne (Polish for &quot;Strong&quot;) is a Polish brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Imperial Tobacco.

==History==

Mocne was launched in the 1950s in a variety of designs and by several factories of the state-owned tobacco monopoly, &quot;Wytwórnia Wyrobów Tytoniowych&quot;. In the early 1990s the brand was bought by the Reemtsma company, now a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco. Since then a variety of consumer choices were added, including Lights, Menthol and Extra Lights. In addition to the traditional soft packet, a hard packet was also introduced.

==Controversy==
===Trademark dispute===
In August 2006, it was reported that Imperial Tobacco Polska filed a request for invalidation of the right of protection for &quot;AS MOCNY t&quot; R-139925 registered for Tobacco Plants in Lublin Spółka Akcyjna.

The Supreme Administrative Court in its judgment of 25 May 2006 case file II GSK 64/06 held that the word &quot;mocne&quot; (in English: &quot;strong&quot;) itself that is used as an indication of cigarettes, has not sufficient distinctive character as a trade mark. It may appear as part of a trade mark, but on a distinctive characteristic of a trade mark, which includes the word &quot;mocne&quot;, will decide other words or images and the word &quot;mocne&quot; will remain a purely informational sign that could not become distinctive through use as a trade mark, even in a long term.

The SAC held that all manufacturers of cigarettes have the right to use purely informational sign to indicate the quality of cigarettes sold.

<doc id="976450" wikidata="Q381863" url="?curid=976450" title="Gamal Mubarak">
<text>Gamal Al Din Muhammad Hosni Sayed Mubarak (, ; born 27 December 1963) is the younger of the two sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and former First Lady Suzanne Mubarak. In contrast to his older brother Alaa, Gamal had pursued an active public profile and was starting to wield some influence on political life in the country before the revolution of early 2011.

Prior to the revolution, Gamal was deputy secretary-general of the then-ruling and now-dissolved National Democratic Party, and head of its influential policies committee.

In 2014 and 2015, he was convicted of political corruption for diverting nearly $20 million in state funds to private use, along with his father and brother, and sentenced to four years in prison.

Within the family, under his half-Welsh mother, his name is &quot;Jimmy&quot;, while his brother Alaa is &quot;Alan&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Mubarak&#x27;s given name, Gamal, comes from Egypt&#x27;s second president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. For his early education, he attended St. George&#x27;s College, Cairo before entering the American University in Cairo. He graduated with a business administration degree and he also earned an MBA from the university. He began his professional career working for Bank of America. 
Mubarak left Bank of America to set up London-based Medinvest Associates Ltd, which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.

== Inheritance of power ==
The grooming of Gamal Mubarak to be his father&#x27;s successor as the next president of Egypt became increasingly evident at around 2000. With no vice-president, and with no heir-apparent in sight, Gamal started enjoying considerable attention in Egyptian state-run media. On 3 February 2000, Hosni Mubarak appointed him to the General Secretariat of the ruling National Democratic Party. Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s rise to power in Syria in June 2000 just hours after Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s death, sparked a heated debate in the Egyptian press regarding the prospects for a similar scenario occurring in Cairo.

Mubarak founded, and became chairman of, the Future Generation Foundation (FGF), an NGO supporting job training but which also served as a vehicle for Mubarak&#x27;s political career.

Both President Mubarak and his son denied the possibility of any inheritance of power in Egypt. More recently, this claim was made in early 2006, when Gamal Mubarak declared repeatedly that he had no aspiration to succeed his father, but that he would maintain his position in the then-ruling NDP as deputy secretary general, a post he held in addition to heading the party&#x27;s policy committee, allegedly the most important member of the NDP.

In September 2004, several political groups (most are unofficial), on both the left and the right, announced their sharp opposition to the inheritance of power. They demanded political change and a fair, multi-candidate election.

On 26 February 2005, Mubarak ordered the constitution changed to allow multi-candidate presidential elections before September 2005 by asking parliament to amend Article 76 of the Egyptian constitution. This change in the constitution was seen then by some analysts and senior judicial figures as a ploy to seamlessly allow Gamal Mubarak to inherit the top position in Egypt. According to this view, Gamal Mubarak would be one of the candidates in a presidential elections and would be supported by the ruling party and the government-controlled media. Since remaining serious candidates would be disqualified by the NDP-controlled People&#x27;s Assembly leaving only the less popular candidates, the inheritance of power would be accomplished through a &quot;democratic&quot; process. However these were all merely assumptions made by political activists, analysts, and opponents.

==End of his father&#x27;s presidency==
Some political analysts speculate that the alleged deteriorating state of the Egyptian economy in the last days of Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s rule was caused by Gamal and his friends taking over as political advisers to Mubarak. On the other hand, a wide range of analysts credit Gamal Mubarak for reviving the Egyptian economy over the previous five years, from a stagnant, mostly state-run economy to a largely free market system that enjoyed five percent GDP growth.

During the first week of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution there were unconfirmed reports and speculation that Gamal might have left Egypt during the protests. However, on 3 February 2011, Gamal was present for an ABC News interview of his father in Cairo.

As the 2011 Egyptian revolution unfolded, newly appointed vice president Omar Suleiman met a major public concern when he announced on 3 February 2011 that Gamal Mubarak would not seek election.

Reuters Africa reported that a fight took place between him and his older brother, Alaa Mubarak. Alaa supposedly accused Gamal of ruining their father&#x27;s last days in power and humiliating him.

==Political corruption convictions==
Following the stepping down of Hosni Mubarak, media sources started to point to the &#x27;suspicious&#x27; financial dealings of Gamal Mubarak. On 28 February 2011, the Egyptian daily &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; published a list of bank accounts allegedly belonging to Gamal Mubarak. &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; reported that the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt received a report that Gamal Mubarak inexplicably amassed significant sums of money that were deposited in these accounts. This allegation came on background of a decision from the Prosecutor General of Egypt to freeze all bank accounts belonging to the Mubarak family, including Gamal Mubarak. The Egyptian Appeals Court ordered that Mubarak&#x27;s financial status is reviewed by the court on 5 March 2011. It is expected that the court will render a decision in that hearing whether to uphold the decision to freeze Mubarak&#x27;s assets.

On 13 April 2011, Gamal was imprisoned for 15 days pending investigations for corruption, abuse of power, and for his alleged role in causing the fatalities and casualties of peaceful protesters during the revolution which was sparked on 25 January 2011. An official investigation accused Gamal Mubarak of using his influence in the National Democratic Party and as son of the president to award contracts to foreign companies in which he was a partner. He appeared in court, alongside his father and brother. Gamal and his brother still remained in prison, whereas their father was released from jail but put on house arrest for 15 days.

On 19 December 2013, Gamal was once again freed after he was acquitted of corruption along with his brother and Ahmed Shafik, ex-candidate of 2012 Egyptian presidential election.

On 21 May 2014, a Cairo court convicted Mubarak and his sons Alaa and Gamal of embezzling the equivalent of of state funds intended for renovation of presidential palaces but were instead diverted to upgrade private family homes. The court ordered the repayment of , fined the trio , and sentenced Mubarak to three years in prison and each of his sons to four years. They were retried and convicted again in May 2015. In October 2015 he and his brother were released from prison, based on time already served.

In September 2018, Gamal was arrested along with his brother Alaa and accused of stock market manipulation. The same month, Gamal&#x27;s long sought chance of a political future ended after he became ineligible for any political office following the Egypt Court of Cassation&#x27;s decision to uphold his corruption conviction. The corruption convictions of his father and his brother were upheld as well. Both Gamal and his brother were acquitted of the 2018 illicit share trading charge in February 2020.

On 12 March 2021, the European Union revoked the sanctions against nine Egyptian individuals including Mubarak family, adopted since 2011.

==Personal life==
Mubarak is married to Khadiga al-Gammal, with whom he has two children, Farida and Mahmoud. In 2009, his 12-year-old nephew Mohammed (son of Alaa Mubarak) died of a cerebral haemorrhage and had an immediate burial as the Islamic tradition.

<doc id="976456" wikidata="Q504941" url="?curid=976456" title="Panna cotta">
<text>Panna cotta (; ; ) is an Italian dessert of sweetened cream thickened with gelatin and molded. The cream may be aromatized with coffee, vanilla, or other flavorings.

==History==

The name &quot;panna cotta&quot; is not mentioned in Italian cookbooks before the 1960s, yet it is often cited as a traditional dessert of the northern Italian region of Piedmont. One unverified story says that it was invented by a Hungarian woman in the Langhe in the early 19th century. An 1879 dictionary mentions a dish called &quot;latte inglese&quot; (), made of cream cooked with gelatin and molded, although other sources say that &quot;latte inglese&quot; is made with egg yolks, such as &quot;crème anglaise&quot;; perhaps the name covered any thickened custard-like preparation.

The dish might also come from the French recipe of &quot;fromage bavarois&quot; from Marie-Antoine Carême in &quot;le pâtissier royal parisien&quot;, which is the same as the modern panna cotta, except that one part of the cream is whipped to make chantilly and included in the preparation before adding the gelatin.

The Piedmont region includes panna cotta in its 2001 list of traditional food products. Its recipe includes cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, gelatin, rum, and marsala poured into a mold with caramel. Another author considers the traditional flavoring to be peach &quot;eau de vie&quot;, and the traditional presentation not to have sauce or other garnishes.

Panna cotta became fashionable in the United States in the 1990s.

==Preparation==
Sugar is dissolved in warm cream. The cream may be flavored by infusing spices and the like in it or by adding rum, coffee, vanilla, and so on. Gelatin is dissolved in a cold liquid (usually water), then added to the warm cream mixture. This is poured into molds and allowed to set. The molds may have caramel in the bottoms, giving a result similar to a crème caramel. After it solidifies, the panna cotta is usually unmolded onto a serving plate.

Although the name means &#x27;cooked cream&#x27;, the ingredients are only warm enough to dissolve the gelatin and sugar. Italian recipes sometimes call for &quot;colla di pesce&quot; (&#x27;fish glue&#x27;), which may literally be isinglass or, more probably, simply a name for common gelatin.

==Garnishes==
Panna cotta is often served with a coulis of berries or a sauce of caramel or chocolate. It may be covered with other fruits or liqueurs.

==Related dishes==
Bavarian cream is similar to panna cotta but usually includes eggs as well as gelatin and is mixed with whipped cream before setting.

Blancmange is sometimes thickened with gelatin or isinglass, and sometimes with cornstarch.

Panna cotta is sometimes called a custard, but true custard is thickened with egg yolks, not gelatin. A lighter version substitutes cream with Greek yogurt.

<text>George Martin Lane (December 24, 1823 – June 30, 1897) was an American scholar.

==Life and career==
Lane was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1846 from Harvard, and from 1847 to 1851 studied at the universities of Berlin, Bonn, Heidelberg, and Göttingen. In 1851, he received his doctorate at Göttingen for his dissertation &quot;Smyrnaeorum Res Gestae et Antiquitates&quot; and upon returning to America was appointed university professor of Latin at Harvard College.

From 1869 until 1894, when he resigned and became professor emeritus, he was Pope Professor of Latin in the same institution. His &quot;Latin Pronunciation&quot;, which led to the rejection of the English method of Latin pronunciation in the United States, was published in 1871.

His &quot;Latin Grammar&quot;, completed and published by Professor Morris H. Morgan in the following year, is of high value. Lane&#x27;s assistance in the preparation of Harper&#x27;s Latin lexicons was also invaluable. He wrote English light verse with humor and fluency, and two of his efforts, &quot;Jonah&quot; or &quot;In the Black Whale at Ascalon&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of the Lone Fish Ball&quot;, became famous as songs after being set to music.

Upon Lane&#x27;s retirement in 1894, Harvard granted him an honorary degree as well as the first pension it had ever granted a faculty member which, according to Lane, was enough to support him for the rest of his life.

==&quot;The Lone Fish Ball&quot;==
In 1855, while living at Cloverden in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Lane wrote the song &quot;The Lone Fish Ball&quot;; after decades as a staple of Harvard undergraduates, it was modernized into the popular hit &quot;One Meat Ball&quot;. The song is set to the tune of an old song titled &quot;Sipping Cider Through a Straw&quot;.

According to Morgan, the song is based upon an actual experience of Lane&#x27;s at a restaurant in Boston, although the reality involved a half-portion of macaroni, rather than a fish ball. The song goes on to relate the impoverished diner&#x27;s embarrassment at the hands of a disdainful waiter. After becoming popular among Harvard undergraduates, it was translated into a mock Italian operetta, &quot;Il Pesceballo&quot;, by faculty members Francis James Child, James Russell Lowell and John Knowles Paine, set to a pastiche of grand opera music and performed in Boston and Cambridge to raise funds for the Union Army. A fish ball, in New England, was fish and potatoes, pan fried together for breakfast.

In 1944, the song was revived by Tin Pan Alley songwriters Hy Zaret and Lou Singer in a more bluesy format as &quot;One Meat Ball&quot; and popularized by Tony Pastor: The recording by Josh White later became one of the biggest hits of the early part of the American folk music revival. Over the years, it was recorded by Candy Candido, the Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby, Jimmy Savo, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, Lonnie Donegan, Dave Van Ronk, Ry Cooder, Washboard Jungle, Tom Paxton, Shinehead, Ann Rabson, Calvin Russell, Josh White, among others.

<text>Volker Beck (born 30 June 1956 in Nordhausen, Bezirk Erfurt) is a former East German athlete, winner of 400 m hurdles at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

With the best 400 m hurdler in the late 1970s and early 1980s Edwin Moses missing due to the boycott, the most likely winner of the Olympic gold was Volker Beck, the East German 400 m hurdles champion in 1980, 1981 and 1983.

In Moscow, Beck won the 400 m hurdles in 48,70 s, beating second-placed Vasyl Arkhypenko from Soviet Union by 0.16 seconds, although it was the slowest Olympic final since 1964. Beck won his second Olympic medal in 4 × 400 m relay, when he was beaten to a second place by Soviet anchor Viktor Markin.

After his athletics career, Beck started to work as a coach, among other things he was a coach of German National Team.

<doc id="976474" wikidata="Q2543460" url="?curid=976474" title="Marapu">
<text>The Marapu religion (also known as Marafu in Sumba) is a form of ancestral religion that is practiced mainly in the island of Sumba in Indonesia, as well as in many more remote areas of Sumba and Flores. Both the Christians and Muslims on these islands tend to combine their faiths with Marapu. Since Marapu, like Kaharingan of the Dayaks, is not an official religion of Indonesia, and all Indonesian citizens are required to identify as a member of one of the religions sanctioned by law, members have chosen either Christianity or Islam to self identify. This religion initially developed among the Mbojo people (ancient Bima) who inhabited the eastern region of Sumbawa Island, which then expanded and spread further east.

The rapid growth of the Marapu belief system on Sumba Island is vividly narrated in the &quot;Hikayat Putri Kalepe&quot; within &quot;Bo&#x27; Sangaji Kai&quot; (an ancient manuscript of the Bima Kingdom). According to the story, a noble family from Kalepe (a southern region of Bima) fled to Sumba Island after being ostracized for opposing the will of a ruler in &quot;Dana Mbojo&quot; (ancient Bima). The marriage of La Bibano, a noblewoman from Kalepe, to a prominent ruler’s son on Sumba Island significantly contributed to the dissemination of this belief. However, in Mbojo/Bima itself, this belief began to fade with the arrival of Hindu-Buddhist influences (Shiva-Buddha) in the 8th–9th centuries CE, and even more so during the 17th century when the Kingdom of Bima transitioned into an Islamic Sultanate. By then, only communities living in mountainous areas continued practicing it. This was documented by Zollinger in 1850 and Elbert in 1910, who noted that the belief was still practiced in the mountainous regions of Bima.

==Lawsuit==
A member of the Marapu religion, joining forces with representatives of three other indigenous religions, brought a court case to Indonesia&#x27;s Constitutional court, arguing that the civil rights of Marapu followers suffered because they had not been recognized as one of Indonesia&#x27;s six official religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism). On November 7, 2017, Indonesia&#x27;s Constitutional Court decided in their favor, declaring that the earlier laws were discriminatory and violated the principle of equality under the law. In the past, those who failed to declare that they followed one of the recognized religions on their national identity cards could be denied rights to marriage registration or land titles.

== Beliefs ==

Those who practice Marapu believe in temporary life in the world and eternal life in the Doomsday, the world of spirits in Marapu heaven – Prai Marapu. The word &quot;Marapu&quot; means:
* Firstly, the occupants of the eternal heaven, who lead a similar existence to men: they live in couples, and one of these couples is the ancestor of the Sumbanese.
* Secondly, the spirits of Sumbanese ancestors in Prai Marupu.
* Thirdly, the spirits of their relatives.
* Fourthly, all spirits dwelling in the universe: Marapu has mysterious and magical authority over human life.

===Beliefs===
According to Marapu beliefs, any spirit consists of two elements: &quot;Ndewa&quot; and &quot;Hamanangu&quot;. Marapu teachings concern the balance of universal life through which happiness can be gained.

This balance is symbolized by the Great Mother (&quot;Ina Kalada&quot;) and the Great Father (&quot;Ama Kalada&quot;) who live in the universe and take the forms of the moon and the sun. In mythology, they are husband and wife who gave birth to the ancestors of the Sumbanese.

Sumbans believe seven pairs of men and women descended from the sky on a ladder made of buffalo horns to a point in the north-central part of the island, and that suitably buried, they too will ultimately ascend this same ladder to be reunited with their families.

===Practice===
To honor Marapu, the Sumbanese put effigies, called Marapu statues, on stone altars where they lay their offerings in the forms of Sirih Pinang (a dish containing betel leaves, nuts, and lime) and sacrificial cattle. The statues of Marapu are made of wood in the shape of human faces. These images are usually placed in the yards of their houses or inside traditional houses.

A further manifestation of devotion to Merapu and the ancestors is reflected in the continuing construction in parts of East Sumba of impressive stone burial monuments, vestiges of one of the last surviving megalithic cultures on the planet. In many cases, individuals will put their families into debts extending into future generations in order to build these tombstones in the traditional manner.

===Funeral ceremonies===
Funeral ceremonies and burials can be delayed for decades during which the bodies of the deceased are kept in the homes of the living. Once sufficient funds have been acquired, it is not unusual for several generations of Sumbans to be buried or reburied together in segmented compartments of the below-ground tomb in a manner that does not violate incest taboos. While some now use winches and cattle trucks to lift and transport these stones, and others construct them out of cement, the practice of hauling slabs of rock weighing up to 70 tons atop log rollers across the countryside by hand persists in some eastern parts of the island.

The actual event is preceded by months of negotiations between allied clans and villages culminating in hundreds of men participating in the &quot;tarik batu&quot; stone-pulling ceremony. Necessary rites include butchering large numbers of buffalo, cows, pigs, and occasionally horses, and nightly protection rituals at the quarries where the stones are cut. Failure to perform the necessary rites risks an angry response from outraged ancestral forces, whose approval is sought through the divining of animal innards.

===Adaptation===
While the influence of evangelical churches is growing in Sumba and reflected in mass conversion ceremonies, many islanders retain their beliefs and practice in secret. These conversions can be traumatic for elderly Sumbans who believe that by converting they sever the relationship with their forebears. Others, particularly young people, convert for more pragmatic reasons: Indonesia formally recognizes five state religions, and sought-after positions in the civil service, police and military are closed to Merapu practitioners.

While not common, there are cases where devout Christianized Sumbans have rebuilt ancestral burial tombs or provided money and support to ensure previous generations are buried in the prescribed manner. Similarly, Christian Sumbans are often buried in cement tombs modeled on the Merapu, though the service is conducted by church officials.

<text>Alessandro Bonvicino (also Buonvicino) (possibly 22 December 1554), more commonly known as Moretto, or in Italian Il Moretto da Brescia (the Moor of Brescia), was an Italian Renaissance painter from Brescia, where he also mostly worked. His dated works span the period from 1524 to 1554, but he was already described as a master in 1516. He was mainly a painter of altarpieces that tend towards sedateness, mostly for churches in and around Brescia, but also in Bergamo, Milan, Verona, and Asola; many remain in the churches they were painted for. The majority of these are on canvas, but a considerable number, including some large pieces, are created on wood panels. There are only a few surviving drawings from the artist.

He also painted a few portraits, but these are more influential. A full-length &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; in the National Gallery, London, dated 1526, seems to be the earliest Italian independent portrait at full length, all the more unexpected as the subject, though clearly a wealthy nobleman, shows no sign of being from a princely ruling family. This format, and the background of an exterior largely closed off by a column the man leans on, was taken up by his main assistant Giovanni Battista Moroni, who painted mainly portraits and was one of the most important portraitists of the mid-16th century.

He was a prominent and pious citizen of the small city of Brescia, belonging to at least two of the most prominent confraternities.

==Biography==
He was born at Rovato, in Brescian territory, and studied first under Fioravante Ferramola. Others state he trained with Vincenzo Foppa. His brothers Pietro and Jacopo were also painters. He may have been apprenticed to Titian in Venice and modelled his earlier portrait-painting on the Venetian style. On the other hand, the style also resembles that of Giorgione or late Bellini. He conceived a great enthusiasm for Raphael, though he never travelled to Rome; on the other hand, his classical serenity resembles that shown by Leonardo and his followers in Lombardy such as Bramantino. He may have consulted with his contemporary Girolamo Savoldo.
Moretto excelled more in sedate altarpieces than in narrative action, and more in oil painting than in fresco, although he painted fine frescoes depicting the idle daughters of Count Martinengo in one of the palaces near Brescia. In 1521, he worked with Girolamo Romanino in the &quot;Cappella del Sacramento&quot; in the Old Cathedral of Brescia, where Moretto completed a &quot;Last Supper&quot;, &quot;Elijah in the Desert&quot;, and a &quot;Fall of Manna&quot;. He was active during 1522–1524 in Padua.
He painted alongside Lorenzo Lotto at Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo. In Brescia, he completed a &quot;Five Virgin Martyrs&quot; and his masterpiece, the &quot;Assumption of the Madonna&quot; for the church of San Clemente; a &quot;Coronation of the Madonna with four saints&quot; () for the church of Santi Nazaro e Celso; and a &quot;St Joseph&quot; for Santa Maria delle Grazie. Another work, with two small children depicted, is his canvas of &quot;St Nicholas of Bari presenting two children to Virgin&quot; (1539) originally painted for the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, but now in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo. He collaborated with Floriano Ferramola in the decoration of the dome of Brescia Cathedral.

In the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna is a &quot;St Justina&quot; (once ascribed to Il Pordenone); in the Staedel Museum, Frankfurt, the &quot;Madonna Enthroned between Sts. Anthony and Sebastian&quot;; in the Berlin Museum, a colossal &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, and a large votive picture (one of the master&#x27;s best) of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, with infant angels and other figures above the clouds, and below, amid a rich landscape, two priests; in the National Gallery, Central London, is a &quot;St Bernardino and Other Saints&quot;.
Throughout his career his works display an internal oscillation between the traditions of Venetian painting and the Central Italian schools. Simultaneously he looked at the form and colour of Venetian artists such as Titian and Palma the Elder whilst his classicising, sweet intensity earned him the name &quot;Raphael of Brescia&quot;. Though there is some uncertainty regarding his studio, he took on a number of pupils, the most important of whom was the portraitist Giovanni Battista Moroni. He also influenced Callisto Piazza.

Il Moretto was stated to have been a man of great personal piety, preparing himself by prayer and fasting for any great act of sacred art, such as the painting of the Virgin-mother.

==Public collections==
Moretto is represented in the following collections: National Gallery, London; Metropolitan Museum, New York; Hermitage, St. Petersburg; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; Staedel Museum, Frankfurt; Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia, Venice; Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo, Brescia (&quot;Annunciation&quot;); Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan; National Gallery of Art, Washington; Louvre, Paris; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, amongst others.

<doc id="976493" wikidata="Q5092894" url="?curid=976493" title="Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park">
<text>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park is located in the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland. The park was established in 1961 as a National Monument by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to preserve the neglected remains of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and many of its original structures.

The canal and towpath trail extends along the Potomac River from the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., to Cumberland, Maryland, a distance of . In 2013, the path was designated as the first section of U.S. Bicycle Route 50. With over four million visitors in 2022, it is the most-visited unit that is designated a national historical park of the National Park Service.

==The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal==
Construction on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (also known as &quot;the Grand Old Ditch&quot; or the &quot;C&amp;O Canal&quot;) began in 1828 and ended in 1850 when the canal reached Cumberland, far short of its intended destination of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Occasionally there was talk of extending the 184.5-mile canal: for example, an 1874 proposal to dig an 8.4-mile tunnel through the Allegheny Mountains, and there was a tunnel built to connect with the Pennsylvania canal. Even though the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) beat the canal to Cumberland by eight years, the canal was not entirely obsolete. Only in the mid-1870s did larger locomotives and the adoption of air brakes allow the railroad to set rates lower than the canal, sealing its fate.

The C&amp;O Canal operated from 1831 to 1924 and served primarily to transport coal from the Allegheny Mountains to Washington D.C. The canal was closed in 1924, in part due to several severe floods that devastated the canal&#x27;s financial condition.

===Federal government purchases canal===

In 1938, the abandoned canal was obtained from the B&amp;O Railroad by the United States in exchange for a loan from the federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The government planned to restore it as a recreation area. Additionally, it was viewed as a project for employment for the jobless during the Great Depression. By 1940, the first of the canal were repaired and rewatered, from Georgetown to Violettes lock (Lock 23) and returned to operating condition by African-American enrollees with the Civilian Conservation Corps. The first &quot;Canal Clipper&quot; boat, giving mule-driven rides, began in 1941. It was later replaced by the &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot; in the 1960s.

The project was halted when the United States entered World War II and resources were needed elsewhere. In 1941, Harry Athey suggested to President Franklin Roosevelt that the canal could be converted into an underground highway or a bomb shelter with its roof for landing airplanes. The whole idea was deemed impractical due to the river&#x27;s periodic flooding. In 1942, freshets destroyed the rewatered sections of the canal. National Park Service (NPS) official Arthur E. Demaray pressed that the canal from Dam #1 be restored, to supply water to the Dalecarlia Reservoir in case sabotage or bombing destroyed the normal conduits of water. Since this transformed the canal into a concern of national security, in 1942, the War Production Board approved the work. By 1943, Congress had funded the work, repairs were done, and the Park Service resumed boat trips in October 1943.

Congress expressed interest in developing the canal and towpath as a parkway. Because of the flooding from the 1920s to the 1940s, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building 14 dams, that would have permanently inundated 74 miles of towpath, as well as the Monocacy and Antietam aqueducts. Around 1945, the Corps wanted to remove Dam #8, which would destroy any hope of rewatering the canal above Dam #5, as well as put a levee around in the Cumberland area. Much of this was done, with the NPS cooperating with the Corps, since maintaining an operating canal all the way to Cumberland was too expensive, as well as wanting to preserve the western parts of the canal.

==Creation of the national park==
===The Douglas hike===
The idea of turning the canal over to automobiles was opposed by some, including United States Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas. In March 1954, Douglas led an eight-day hike of the towpath from Cumberland to D.C. 58 people participated in one part of the hike or another; nine, including Douglas, Merlo J. Pusey, and Olaus Murie, hiked the full . Afterwards, Douglas formed a committee, renamed in 1957 the C&amp;O Canal Association, that drafted plans to preserve and protect the Canal. Douglas served as the chairman.

===Towpath===
In 1958, the entire path was cleared for hiking and a 12-mile bicycle trail was built on the towpath, from Georgetown&#x27;s Mule Bridge at 34th Street in Washington, DC to Widewater, a meander cutoff of the Potomac in Maryland. The bicycle trail was built by laying crushed blue stone over the muddy towpath and opened on November 22, 1958. Cyclists were biking the full route by 1960.

===National monument, then national historical park ===
In 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower made the canal a national monument under the Antiquities Act, but that hardened the opposition to making the canal a national park. There was some support for making the Potomac River a national river instead. Within ten years, the political climate had changed, and realizing that the national river plan was unsupportable, the idea of turning the canal into a historic park had little opposition. The &quot;Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park Act&quot; established the canal as a National Historical Park and President Richard Nixon signed it into law on January 8, 1971.

===Floods of 1996===

1996 saw two floods. After a blizzard in January, heavy rains washed away the snow and caused extreme flooding and run-off. The flood swept across 80 to 90 percent of the canal and towpath, damaging them and other park infrastructure. Volunteers helped repair the damage. 

In September, Hurricane Fran caused more damage to the canal. Restoring the towpath and re-watering required much time, money, and volunteer effort.

===Restoration efforts===
Today, several organizations work to preserve and restore the park&#x27;s beauty and history. The C&amp;O Canal Trust, founded in 2007, is the official non-profit partner of the National Park Service. The C&amp;O Canal Association is a volunteer organization established in 1954 to help conserve the natural and historical environment of the C&amp;O Canal and the Potomac River Basin. Together they work to restore Canal infrastructure, fix eroded sections of the towpath, and re-water sections of the Canal to keep it beautiful for visitors and wildlife. They also educate the community about the Canal&#x27;s history at the National Park Service&#x27;s six visitor centers along the canal: Georgetown, Great Falls Tavern, Brunswick, Williamsport, Hancock, and Cumberland.

Current restoration and construction efforts include restoring and rewatering the Conococheague Aqueduct, restoring Locks 3 and 4, repairs at Great Falls (Lock 20) and Swain&#x27;s Lock (Lock 21). A second phase of work at the Paw Paw tunnel started on May 13, 2019.

==Today==

===Extent===
The park includes nearly in a strip along the Potomac River. A small portion of the towpath near Harpers Ferry National Historical Park doubles as a section of the Appalachian Trail.

The canal begins at its zero mile marker (accessible only via Thompson&#x27;s Boat House), directly on the Potomac, opposite the Watergate complex.

In Allegany County, Maryland, the park includes the Western Maryland Railroad Right-of-Way, Milepost 126 to Milepost 160, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

Flooding continues to threaten historical structures on the canal and attempts at restoration. The Park Service has re-watered portions of the canal, but the majority of the canal does not have water in it.

===Usage===

Varied in its geography, the canal and its towpath along with the adjacent Potomac offers activities including running, hiking, biking, fishing, boating and kayaking, as well as rock climbing in certain locations. The Canal also offers a variety of wildlife and birdwatching opportunities.

The seven National Park Service visitor centers have displays and interpretive exhibits on the history of the canal. The park offers rides on two reproduction canal boats—the &quot;Georgetown&quot; and the &quot;Charles F. Mercer&quot; (named after the first president of the Canal corporation, and not the first boat on the canal named &quot;Charles F. Mercer&quot;)—during the spring, summer and autumn. The boats are pulled by mules, and park rangers in historical dress work the locks and boat while presenting a historical program.

Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park receives around five million recreation visits annually. Access through the Great Falls Tavern Visitor Center requires payment, but access anywhere else in the park is free. In January 2015, the National Park Service proposed adding entrance fees to virtually all access points along the towpath; the proposal was rescinded in February, amid backlash from communities along the canal.

On February 9, 1963, Robert F. Kennedy succeeded in hiking from Great Falls, Maryland to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia along the C&amp;O Canal towpath as part of the &quot;50 mile frenzy&quot; created by his brother President John F. Kennedy. In February 2013, FreeWalkers, Inc., a New Jersey–based non-profit, created the FreeWalkers Kennedy50 50-Mile walk along the C&amp;O Canal towpath from Old Anglers Inn to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia to commemorate RFK&#x27;s historic walk and continues to be held annually.

====Hiker biker campsites====

The National Park Service maintains a number of hiker/biker campsites, about every along the towpath. These are available for free on a first come first served basis. Each site has a water pump (mid-April to mid-November), picnic area, firepit, and latrine; nearest vehicular access points vary from to &quot;remote&quot;. A list of hiker biker campsites is available from the NPS.

====Other camping====

The C&amp;O Canal NHP also offers tent and primitive RV campsites for individuals and group as large as 35. Not all campsites have all amenities; campsites may have some or all of parking, restrooms, picnic tables, boat ramp, and nearby shopping. Hiker-biker campsites are free of charge to use for a maximum of one night per trip. They are used under a first-come, first-served basis. As of December 1, 2016 all drive-in (car) campsites moved from a first-come, first served system to a reservation system on Recreation.gov. Group campsites are $40 during peak season and $20 during off season. Here is a list of the drive-in, reservation campsites: (data from NPS):

<text>The Palfinger AG (stylized as PALFINGER AG), headquartered in Bergheim (Salzburg/Austria), is a publicly traded technology and machinery manufacturing company for hydraulic crane and lifting equipment for the land and maritime sectors. The company, founded in 1932, is known for its truck-mounted loader cranes. 

With over 100 models of this product, Palfinger is considered a global market leader. 

==History==
=== 1930s to 1960s: Foundation and orientation ===
The history of Palfinger dates back to 1932, with the founding of a repair shop for agricultural trailers, tippers, and vehicle bodies by Richard Palfinger. The company built its first crane in 1959, and when Richard&#x27;s son Hubert took over management in 1964, production was switched to hydraulic loader cranes.

=== 1970s to 2000s: Internationalization and expansion ===
In the following years, the focus was on expanding the product range and internationalizing the company. In 1984, the company opened an assembly and manufacturing plant in Lengau with 90 employees. By 1989, Palfinger had expanded into over 70 countries and achieved an export rate of over 90%. In 1993, a plant was acquired in Maribor, Slovenia. Additionally, Palfinger opened a plant for the production of skip loaders in France. To further expand its business in the U.S. market, Palfinger acquired the American crane dealer Tiffin Loader Cranes and established Palfinger USA Inc. Furthermore, in 2001, the company acquired a partner in the South American market by acquiring the Brazilian company Madal.

The company went public in June 1999. In 2004, Palfinger acquired Bison Deutschland, a provider of truck-mounted aerial work platforms. A year later, the company acquired the British producer of tail lifts and entry systems, Ratcliff Tail Lifts. In 2005, the company opened an Asia headquarter in Singapore along with other locations in Asia. Additionally, Palfinger invested in its existing production sites in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Eastern Germany, and the USA.

In 2008, Palfinger acquired the American company Omaha Standard in Iowa, which manufactures truck bodies and liftgates for pickups. Additionally, they acquired the aerial work platform division of the German company Wumag. In 2009, Palfinger purchased the container handling system manufacturer Automated Waste Equipment (AWE) in New Jersey, as well as acquiring an 80% stake in the aerial work platform manufacturer Eti Inc. in Oklahoma. The following year, Palfinger entered the marine crane market through the acquisition of 75% of the Dutch company Ned-Deck Marine.

=== 2010s: Growth through collaborations ===
In 2010, Palfinger acquired the marine and wind crane division of Palfinger Systems. In 2012, a collaboration with the Chinese construction machinery manufacturer Sany Heavy Industries (Sany) began, resulting in the construction of a plant in Changsha.

The following year, Palfinger acquired the Norwegian Harding Group, which almost doubled its business in the marine sector. In the fiscal year 2016, Palfinger achieved a revenue of €1.36 billion. Furthermore, Sany reduced its stake to 7.5%.

In June 2018, Andreas Klauser took over as the CEO.

=== 2020s: Expansion of Locations and Sales ===
In 2020, Palfinger acquired its second-largest independent distributor worldwide, Hinz Försäljnings, based in Sweden, and the following year took over the Spanish distributor Equipdraulic. The cross-shareholding with the Sany Group of 7.5% was dissolved by the end of 2021. Furthermore, Palfinger began expanding the technology center in Köstendorf with investments totaling €5 million. In the same year, Palfinger acquired the companies TSK Kran und Wechselsysteme GmbH and TSR Lacktechnik. Additionally, they acquired the rights to the Offshore Passenger Transfer System (OPTS) technology from Lift2Work B.V. In the fiscal year 2023, the company surpassed the revenue threshold of €2 billion for the first time.

In 2022, Palfinger opened a new location in Vienna called The Hub Vienna and relocated the truck-mounted aerial work platform production from Krefeld to Löbau. The company also opened the Palfinger Campus as a training and education center and Palfinger World at its site in Lengau. In June 2023, Palfinger established a central hub for its activities in the USA in Schaumburg, Illinois. In 2023, Palfinger signed a ten-year contract with the Norwegian oil exploration and development company Aker BP for the development and market introduction of remote-controlled offshore cranes. In implementing this project, Palfinger is collaborating with the software developer Optilift.

<doc id="976503" wikidata="Q14713129" url="?curid=976503" title="Richmond Professional Institute">
<text>The Richmond Professional Institute (RPI) was an educational institution established in 1917, which merged with the Medical College of Virginia in 1968 to form Virginia Commonwealth University. RPI was located on what is now known as the Monroe Park Campus of VCU. The entire history of RPI can be found in &quot;A History of the Richmond Professional Institute&quot; written by Dr. Henry H. Hibbs Jr. From 1925, it was part of the College of William &amp; Mary and, later, The Colleges of William &amp; Mary.

==History==
===Beginning (1916–1917)===
Beginning in October 1916, community leaders, brought together by the Bureau of Vocations for Women, organized the Richmond School of Social Economy to address urban social and health concerns and to be &quot;the first of its kind in the south.&quot; The school opened on October 11, 1917, with 30 students, all of whom were women. Of the 30 students, 7 were involved in social work and 23 in public health nursing.

In 1920, RPI opened its doors to both men and women, but the first man did not enroll until 1927.

===First Building (1917–1919)===
Reverend Scherer secured the first home for the Richmond School of Social Work on the third floor of an old brick residence in Capitol Square across from the Governor&#x27;s mansion at 1112 Capitol Street. At the time nothing suggested a professional school, college, or university in the area and on the building the sign read &quot;Richmond Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.&quot;

===Surviving the Great Depression with no state support===

In 1925, the school became the Richmond Division of the College of William and Mary because of $10,000 in support given to RPI each year. In the transition to becoming a public institution from 1925 to 1940, the school was one of the few &quot;state-supported colleges&quot; in the country operating almost entirely without state support. The lack of funding was due mainly to a popular belief that Virginia already had too many public universities and that leaders in Virginia believed the only proper location for a college or university was in a small town and not in an urban environment. With the support from The College of William and Mary, it acquired 827 West Franklin Street (now known as Founder&#x27;s Hall). The building was purchased for $73,000 and $23,000 was needed for repairs. In 1928, the Richmond Division becomes the Richmond Professional Institute of The College of William and Mary. When the Great Depression hit and RPI continued to receive no state support, the federal government stepped in to fill the gap. With the help of the Works Progress Administration, many of the buildings were renovated during the depression. In fact, Dr. Hibbs was quoted as saying,

&quot;...if it had not been for the WPA, the Richmond Professional Institute would not have amounted to much. In the days before the legislature made appropriations to RPI the WPA enabled us to survive and even grow a little.&quot;

===School of Art===
In 1928, Hibbs hired the Richmond born Theresa Pollak as the first full-time art instructor. She founded the School of Art, the forerunner to the VCU School of the Arts. It began as one night class with 8 full-time students the first year and 25 or 30 part-time students. Between 1943 and 1945 Clyfford Still, an important member of the developing world of Abstract Expressionism taught art, and furthered his own distinctive style painting dozens of new works.

When RPI became VCU in 1968, the School of the Arts was the largest professional art school in the country, with 1,200 full-time undergraduate students and 75 graduate students.

===An Entirely Different College and an Independent State University ===
In 1939 the school was renamed the Richmond Professional Institute of the College of William and Mary. RPI suffered from having a campus with no new buildings and instead consisted entirely of renovated houses. In effort to improve the image of RPI, the first new buildings were created in the 1950s. In 1951, Franklin Street Gym became the first new building on RPI&#x27;s campus constructed entirely with state funds.

In RPI&#x27;s 1953 pamphlet, &quot;An Entirely Different College,&quot; Hibbs defined a professional institute as a college or university that arranged most of its programs of study around occupations or professions. Not abiding to the traditional University system, RPI gained a reputation as a unique institution in conservative Virginia. This uniqueness found its way into many of the art and literature students during the 1950s and 1960s as they adopted the beatnik look and dress style. When George Oliver took over as president in 1959, he did not believe that RPI still needed the name recognition that William and Mary brought. This, along with growing radicalism among the students and faculty of RPI began to sever the relationship with the parent school.

In 1960, RPI became part of The Colleges of William &amp; Mary, a short-lived system consisting of W&amp;M and its associated institutions. However, both RPI and the Norfolk Division of W&amp;M (soon renamed the Norfolk College of W&amp;M) chafed at being part of the system; RPI was already accredited on its own, and the Norfolk College received its own accreditation in 1961.

The Virginia General Assembly dissolved The Colleges in 1962, with RPI and the Norfolk College (now known as Old Dominion University) becoming independent state universities. At the same time, RPI took on the nickname of Rams.

===Becoming VCU===

Virginia Commonwealth University was established on July 1, 1968, becoming the first truly urban university in Virginia. In just one year, the new Virginia Commonwealth University was the largest University in the state at a head count of 13,374, of which 12,059 were from the former RPI campus and 1,675 were from the Medical college.

====Envisioning a Great Urban University====
At the 1969 convocation for VCU, Dr. Brandt envisioned a great urban University, stating, &quot;we are caught up in a thing you might call the Virginia Commonwealth University Idea. It&#x27;s an exciting concept...an academic approach without precedent, VCU will become a name that will mean a great deal to you in years to come...as one of the leading educational institutions.&quot;

====VCU&#x27;s Founding Principles====
In his inaugural address as VCU&#x27;s first president, November 10, 1970, Dr. Warren W. Brandt itemized some of VCU&#x27;s special educational benefits to the urban community which it serves as a responsive citizen.
* Provide special programs for those working on urban problems
* Teach how to live more effectively in the urban environment
* Offer special material to make students aware of urban problems
* Provide a faculty with expertise in a wide variety of relevant specialties
* Furnish a large group of dedicated volunteer workers; faculty, students, and staff
* Provide health care to a large number residents of Richmond and most of Virginia

Three years later, Dr. Brandt echoed this commitment.

&quot;We are striving to be a strong institution with significant emphasis on being an urban university-serving the city, the state, and other institutions. We&#x27;re not trying to be an elitist institution, but to be an institution which meets the needs of the Urban community by accepting a wide range of students into a variety of programs.&quot;

==Athletics==
From 1948 to 1963, RPI&#x27;s sport teams were known as the Green Devils due to their affiliation with The College of William and Mary.

In 1963, the mascot was changed to the Rams when RPI became an independent institution. The Green Devils color scheme no longer matched, so RPI chose blue and grey for its new school colors on the recommendation of the School of the Arts faculty, evoking Richmond as a combination of North and South. When RPI merged with MCV, the color scheme was changed to the current black and gold of Virginia Commonwealth University.

<doc id="976512" wikidata="Q1628298" url="?curid=976512" title="Shock Treatment">
<text>Shock Treatment is a 1981 American musical comedy film directed by Jim Sharman, and co-written by Sharman and Richard O&#x27;Brien. It is a follow-up to the 1975 film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. While not an outright sequel, the film does feature characters from the previous film, most portrayed by different actors, as well as several &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; actors in new roles. The film stars Jessica Harper as Janet and Cliff DeYoung in a dual role as Brad and the film&#x27;s main antagonist Farley Flavors, with O&#x27;Brien and Patricia Quinn playing sibling character actors, Cosmo and Nation McKinley, and Nell Campbell playing Nurse Ansalong.

The film is set in the fictional town of Denton, which has been placed under the control of a television network. The town&#x27;s entire population is involved in the network&#x27;s productions. Brad Majors finds himself imprisoned in the local mental hospital, while his wife Janet becomes the pet project of Farley Flavors, the local plutocrat.

Given a limited release on the midnight movie circuit beginning on October 30, 1981, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; was a critical and commercial failure, not earning the same level of cult film status its predecessor received, but contemporary reviews have since praised its satirical themes, particularly a prescient satire of reality television. In 2015, the film was adapted as a stage production in London.

==Plot==
Continuing from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; are the characters of Brad and Janet Majors, now married. The film takes place in the town of Denton, USA, which has been taken over by fast food magnate Farley Flavors. The film is set within a DTV (Denton Television) network television studio and opens as the studio audience is admitted into the studio. Brad and Janet, seated in the audience, are chosen to participate in the game show &quot;Marriage Maze&quot; by the kooky, supposedly blind host, Bert Schnick. While on the &quot;Marriage Maze&quot;, Brad is deemed &quot;an emotional cripple,&quot; and is forcibly sent to Dentonvale, a mental hospital run by siblings Cosmo and Nation McKinley and the subject of the synonymously named reality show, for &quot;treatment.&quot;

While Brad is locked away at Dentonvale, Farley Flavors persuades Janet to pursue superstardom, suggesting that her fame will make Brad better. Although Janet participates willingly, her compliance is assured when she is drugged by the McKinleys. Janet&#x27;s parents, Emily and Harry Weiss, also become enamored with fame and television, appearing first on &quot;Marriage Maze,&quot; answering questions about Brad&#x27;s alleged mental instability, and later, as their &quot;prize&quot; for answering questions about Brad correctly, on &quot;Happy Homes,&quot; a reality TV show that follows people on a television set of an idealized suburban home. Rapidly, Janet and her parents forget about Brad and become obsessed with fame.

In the meantime, Betty Hapschatt and Judge Oliver Wright, cohosts of the Denton Dossier and the only people not won over by Farley Flavors&#x27; flashy television shows, investigate Flavors and the other people involved in DTV. The duo eventually discover that Cosmo and Nation McKinley are not doctors as they claim, but merely character actors, and that Farley Flavors himself is Brad&#x27;s jealous, long-lost twin brother, seeking to destroy Brad and take Janet for himself. Betty Hapschatt and Judge Wright break Brad out from his prison in Dentonvale and have him confront his twin. The trio break onto the set of Farley&#x27;s latest show, &quot;Faith Factory,&quot; during its debut just as Janet, who is heavily drugged, is about to be crowned &quot;Miss Mental Health.&quot; Seeing Brad helps Janet snap out of her drug-induced trance and she returns to him. Flavors imprisons Brad, Janet, Betty, and Judge Wright, then invites the remaining audience members to follow him to Dentonvale. Everyone except the four prisoners and the kids in the local band, Oscar Drill and the Bits, willingly and enthusiastically accept straitjackets and commit themselves to Dentonvale in the name of &quot;mental health.&quot; Brad, Janet, Betty, and Judge Wright escape the office they are locked into using one of Betty&#x27;s hairpins to pick the lock. They join the band and successfully hotwire the car given to Miss Mental Health by a show sponsor. Band members force open the door to the studio and Brad, Janet, Betty, Judge Wright and the band drive out of the studio. As the car drives off, voice over reminds the viewer that &quot;the sun never sets on those who ride into it.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Coinciding with the release of the film, Ode Records issued the soundtrack album on vinyl and cassette in 1981, and later reissued it on CD in 1994. The album includes longer versions of &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m a Man&quot; and &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, as well as two unlisted bits taken directly from the film, the Farley Flavors &quot;commercial break&quot; (after &quot;Denton U.S.A.&quot;) and the rhyming dialogue, which directly precedes &quot;Duel Duet&quot; (before Duel Duet on the vinyl and cassette releases, and after &quot;Breaking Out&quot; on the CD version).

All editions are missing Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s solo version of the title song (which plays during the end credits and features backing vocals by Nell Campbell), though it was released as a 7&quot; vinyl single, and included on the CD &quot;Songs from the Vaults: A Collection of Rocky Horror Rarities&quot;, which was exclusive to the &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show 15th Anniversary&quot; boxed set.

All LP, cassette and CD issues of the soundtrack include the credit &quot;Music and lyrics by Richard Hartley and Richard O&#x27;Brien&quot;. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s solo single version of the track &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; reverses the order, and gives writing credit to Richard O&#x27;Brien &amp; Richard Hartley.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the unexpected and overwhelming success of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; on the midnight circuit, Richard O&#x27;Brien approached producer Michael White with the idea of filming a sequel. In 1978, he began work on a script titled &quot;Rocky Horror Shows His Heels&quot;, which found Frank and Rocky resurrected, Brad and Dr. Scott now lovers, and Janet pregnant with Frank&#x27;s baby. Director Jim Sharman was resistant to revisit the material and Tim Curry had no desire to reprise the role of Frank, but O&#x27;Brien had put some work into the songs, so he decided to retain them and simply revise the story.

The new script was titled &quot;The Brad and Janet Show&quot;. This version is closer to what ultimately became &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; and was planned to be produced, but the filmmakers were plagued with a variety of problems. Dr. Scott had also been included in the script, but Jonathan Adams was busy performing in Tom Lehrer’s musical revue &quot;Tom Foolery&quot; and was not allowed to take time off of his contract to reprise his role. The filmmakers intended to shoot on location in Denton, Texas, but production screeched to a halt in 1980 when the Screen Actors Guild went on strike.

With only a small window when cast and crew were available, the filmmakers had to get creative. Television had been a heavy motif in the script, so production designer Brian Thomson came up with the notion to rework the story and set it in a giant TV studio, utilizing a film studio in England, which shaved $1 million from the budget and gave them the luxury of working in a controlled environment. The script endured a final draft in which all of the locations were changed to television shows, and the role of Dr. Scott morphed into game show host Bert Schnick. &quot;I was frightened the strike was going to finish too soon and we&#x27;d have to go back to our original conception,&quot; commented O&#x27;Brien.

===Casting===
Many &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; cast members returned for the film, but only Jeremy Newson reprised his role as Ralph Hapschatt. Several of the film’s original Transylvanians appeared in the movie; Ishaq Bux, Annabel Leventon, Gaye Brown, and Lindsay Ingram in the DTV audience, while Imogen Claire, Rufus Collins, and Pierre Bedenes were given the slightly-larger parts of the Wardrobe Mistress and Neely’s camera crew, Respectively. Raynor Bourton, who originated the role of Rocky in the stage production, and Robert Longden, who took over the role of Riff Raff from Richard O’Brien in the same production, portrayed two of the soldiers in the DTV audience, and Chris Malcolm, who originated the role of Brad Majors on stage, was cast as Vance Parker, a local police officer. Founder and long-time president of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; fan club, Sal Piro, also has a silent cameo appearance as the man using the payphone during the opening sequence.

With her career on the rise, Susan Sarandon demanded more money than the budget allowed. Auditions were held at The Roxy theater to find a suitable replacement, and Jessica Harper, previously of Brian De Palma&#x27;s cult musical &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;, impressed the filmmakers with her singing skills.

Cliff DeYoung had been Sharman&#x27;s original choice for Brad in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; after they worked together on the 1972 off-Broadway play &quot;Trials of Oz&quot;, but DeYoung was starring on the television series &quot;Sunshine&quot; in California and was unable to appear. Upon learning that Barry Bostwick was unable to participate in &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, Sharman tracked down DeYoung and gave him the role of Brad. This afforded DeYoung the opportunity to reunite with Harper, with whom he had co-starred in a stage production of &quot;Hair&quot;.

===Filming===
As is standard with musicals, music and vocals were recorded prior to principal photography at the renowned Abbey Road Studios. The first scene shot was the Farley Flavors commercial break with Macy Struthers and a group of children. Wendy Raebeck was ill and collapsed after one of her takes.

DeYoung modeled his performance of Brad after David Eisenhower and based Farley on Jack Nicholson. The elaborate opening shot begins on Farley in the overhead video booth, and the camera slowly does a 360° pan around the room as the crew prepares for the show and Brad and Janet enter the studio. For this scene, DeYoung had to do a quick change and quickly run downstairs to hit his second mark. &quot;Duel Duet&quot; was shot over the course of a day, with DeYoung spending the morning shooting his scenes as one character and the remainder of the day costumed as the other. He began with a very restrained performance of the song but was encouraged to go broader and was pleased with the final result.

==Reception==
In spite of pre-release hype (including a promotional TV special called &quot;The Rocky Horror Treatment&quot;), the film was both a critical and commercial failure when it was released only as a midnight movie on Halloween 1981. It never received a full general theatrical first-run release. Due to its increased budget and limited release, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; was an even bigger financial flop than &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;″s original general release in 1975.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 50% of 6 (3 of 6) surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.0/10. According to Metacritic, which assigned the film a weighted average score of 36 out of 100 based on 7 critics, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; has received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

In one of his television reviews, Roger Ebert said that he felt &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; fans would reject a movie that was specifically targeted at them, remarking that &quot;cult film audiences want to feel that they have seen the genius of something that everybody else hates. They discovered this film, they know it&#x27;s good, everyone else thinks it&#x27;s garbage.&quot; &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; was quickly dismissed by most &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; enthusiasts who were put off by the re-casting of the leads and by the fact that Tim Curry did not participate. Fans also resented Richard O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s infamous tagline, &quot;It&#x27;s not a sequel... it&#x27;s not a prequel... it&#x27;s an equal.&quot; (O&#x27;Brien later recanted, frequently criticizing the film by going so far as to refer to it as &quot;an abortion.&quot;) Gradually, however, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; did build up a cult following all its own and, as Ebert wrote, many contemporary reviewers remark that it was initially condemned in part because it was too ahead of its time, being a prescient satire of reality television.

O&#x27;Brien did write a rough script for a direct sequel to &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; titled &quot;Revenge of the Old Queen&quot;. In the story, Brad&#x27;s brother Steve seeks revenge on the aliens in the first film after Brad becomes a Las Vegas go-go dancer and falls to his death from a trapeze wearing only six-inch heels and a rhinestone choker. Also revealed is Sonny, the illegitimate son of Janet and Frank and heir to the throne of Transexual. The script never made it past early draft stages but has been shared on many fan sites.

==Home media==
The film first surfaced on VHS as a rental exclusive in 1982. A retail Laserdisc was released in 1983 in the UK, followed by VHS and Betamax releases in 1985. As &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; was filmed in Open matte, all releases prior to the DVD were presented in a Fullscreen aspect ratio rather than the theatrical 1.85.1 format.

&quot;Shock Treatment&quot; was first released on DVD in the UK on May 22nd, 2006, as part of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show 30th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; The disc only included a theatrical trailer in terms of special features. A special edition DVD, labeled as the &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot;, was issued in the United States on September 5, 2006, both as a stand-alone release and packaged with the 2-disc &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; special edition. Special features include an audio commentary with fan club presidents Mad Man Mike and Bill Brennan, a making-of featurette, a music retrospective featurette, and domestic and international trailers.

Virtually every home video edition has suffered from audio flaws. VHS and Beta editions included warbling anomalies during the Overture and Farley&#x27;s Song, which briefly knocked the sound out of sync. All DVD releases include a brief sound dropout before the last chorus of Denton U.S.A., and a chunk of the end credit Overture has been lopped off to prematurely fade into the single version of Shock Treatment. The original version features the complete Overture playing over the credits, with Shock Treatment continuing over a black screen as exit music. This edit shortens the film&#x27;s running time from 94 to 92 minutes.

In 2017, the British label Arrow Video released the film on Blu-ray in the UK which featured a new commentary with Quinn and Little Nell, as well as &quot;The Rocky Horror Treatment&quot;. It has not received a Blu-ray release in the States.

==Stage adaptation==

===Production===
For nearly a decade beginning in the mid 2000s, director Benji Sperring, a fan of the film, attempted to convince Richard O&#x27;Brien to give him the rights to produce a stage adaptation of &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;. O&#x27;Brien finally relented and gave his consent, stipulating that it had to be staged in a very small, intimate venue, as the original &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; had been. On this proviso, the show wound up at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in Islington, London, where artistic director Adam Spreadbury-Maher made the suggestion that Tom Crowley adapt the script. Crowley had never seen the film, and read the screenplay first to prepare for his interview. He was initially apprehensive about the project, but Sperring&#x27;s vision was so concise that he agreed. It was reported that O&#x27;Brien adapted and produced the show, but otherwise remained fairly hands-off. O&#x27;Brien, co-composer Richard Hartley and Sperring agreed on the story&#x27;s direction prior to scripting, and they consulted primarily through email during the rest of the production process.

Sperring and Crowley reworked the story, eliminating most of the supporting and peripheral characters. &quot;A big point of inspiration for me came from the screenplay that became &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, &quot;The Brad and Janet Show&quot;,&quot; commented Crowley, &quot;wherein the major factor in Brad and Janet&#x27;s marital difficulties was that Janet had just been promoted at the local TV studio and Brad had just lost his job.&quot;

&quot;The biggest shock is that in the original movie, there isn&#x27;t any shock treatment,&quot; Sperring remarked. &quot;They don&#x27;t really explore that, so we&#x27;ve put that back in.&quot;

The production premiered at the King&#x27;s Head theatre in Islington, London in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2015.

===Cast===
*Julie Atherton as Janet Majors
*Ben Kerr as Brad Majors
*Mark Little/Pete Gallagher as Farley Flavours
*Mateo Oxley as Ralph Hapschatt
*Rosanna Hyland as Betty Hapschatt
*Nic Lamont as Nation McKinley
*Adam Rhys-Davies as Cosmo McKinley

===Reception===
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote &quot;this sequel to &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; can&#x27;t match the original but still provides deliriously silly entertainment&quot;; &quot;The Stage&quot; singled out Mark Little as being scarcely able to carry a tune, but Carrie Dunn wrote in her review for Broadway World, &quot;his sheer charisma and presence is absolutely perfect.&quot;

<doc id="976513" wikidata="Q923165" url="?curid=976513" title="Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Third-level education in Ireland includes all education after second-level, encompassing higher education in universities and colleges and further education on Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) and other courses. 

The degree-awarding institutions which can grant awards at all academic levels are the University of Dublin, National University of Ireland (Cork, Dublin, Galway and Maynooth), University of Limerick, Dublin City University, Technological University Dublin, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Munster Technological University, Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, Atlantic Technological University and South East Technological University, as well as St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth (Pontifical University). Quality and Qualifications Ireland, a State agency, can grant awards in other institutions directly, or delegate the authority to do so. The King&#x27;s Inns of Dublin has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of barrister-at-law to practice as barristers. Medical schools in Ireland also have particular regulation. There were seven establishments of higher education within Ireland ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; in 2023.

==Framework==
===Institutions===
The Irish universities include the University of Dublin, better known by the name of its sole college, Trinity College Dublin, the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland, two universities established in 1989, five technological universities formed by the amalgamation of Institutes of Technology and a professional medical institution. Some colleges are constituent colleges of universities, while others are designated institutions of the State agency Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), which succeeded the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. The latter include the remaining Institutes of technology in Ireland in Dundalk and Dún Laoghaire, Colleges of Education, and other independent colleges. Some colleges have &quot;delegated authority&quot; from QQI, this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name.

Some institutions such as the University of Limerick, Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), and Dublin City University (DCU) have completed a process of modularising their courses (others are still in a transition phase), mostly using the ECTS. The Bologna process and applied research are the current concerns of national educational policy, additional concerns include the structures of the National University of Ireland. In 2019 TU Dublin amalgamated three institutions in the Dublin region (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and Institute of Technology, Tallaght), and in 2021 Munster Technological University amalgamated two institutions in the Munster region (Cork Institute of Technology, and Institute of Technology, Tralee), while the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest was formed by the merger of Limerick Institute of Technology and Athlone Institute of Technology. The Atlantic Technological University, through the merger of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology and South East Technological University with the merger of Institute of Technology, Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology in 2022.

The &quot;Marks &amp; Standards&quot; document, offered by most institutions, can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards, while programme specifications offer additional information. In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system, entry tends to be highly competitive for school leavers; the so-called &quot;Points Race&quot; administered by the Central Applications Office (CAO). In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50% for the first time, while as of 2005 it was in excess of 55% and expected to grow at approximately 1% per annum for the next decade.

There are over 25 third-level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language. &quot;Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge&quot; is the Irish language Department of the University of Galway and it has different off-campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions. Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar. University College Dublin (UCD), TU Dublin, and Atlantic Technological University (ATU) also offer similar courses.

All but two of the eleven universities in Ireland offer &quot;open&quot; (omnibus entry) Bachelor of Arts degrees through the CAO where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study. The two universities that do not offer &quot;open&quot; (omnibus entry) arts degrees, Trinity College Dublin and DCU, do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as Drama Studies, Journalism, Latin, History, Japanese, and International Relations.

In one, Trinity College Dublin, the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects, such as French and Philosophy – which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one. DCU&#x27;s de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by St. Patrick&#x27;s College of Education (a college of DCU) and is titled &quot;BA in Humanities&quot;. All Hallows College (a college of DCU) offer BA in humanities, theology pastoral care, and English.

Entry into higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO. In this way, students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university. Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent. Each university has a minimum entry requirement, usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish, as well as maths. Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language (French, German, Spanish or Italian). Each individual course has further entry requirements, for example, science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences. The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system. However, universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students, and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course.

Entry into third-level is generally very high in Ireland (as it also is in Northern Ireland), and among young adults (those aged 25 to 34), 41.6% of them have attained third-level degrees—the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus, and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1%. Broken down by gender, approximately 43% of women and 40% of men Ireland attend third level education.

===Ireland as a study abroad destination for international students===

In recent years, Ireland has become a top study destination for higher education, attracting students not only from within the European Union, but from international destinations such as India, South East Asia and Africa. 
With the outcome of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom in 2016, Ireland has grown substantially in popularity for international students wanting to study higher education level degrees there. Mostly due to its high concentration of multinational companies and booming economy.

===Undergraduate fees===

Under the &quot;Free Fees Initiative&quot; the Government pays the tuition fees of students who meet relevant course, nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative. These requirements include:

* Holding EU nationality, or are a national of member country of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, or those who have been granted official refugee status.
* Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course.
* Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course.

Students are required to pay a &quot;registration fee&quot; on entry to their courses. These charges cover costs such as equipment usage, administration fees and exam fees. Charges were €1,500 per student for the 2009/10 school year. These charges have been labelled as &quot;unofficial fees&quot;, and some university heads admitted that &quot;student registration charges are fees by any other name&quot;.
In 2011, after large annual increases, the registration fee was abolished and replaced with a &quot;student contribution&quot; that stood at €3,000. For the school year 2023/2024 students had to pay that amount plus the &quot;student levy&quot; of €150.

===Postgraduate fees===

The &quot;Free Fees Initiative&quot; only covers Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, so postgraduate students pay fees regardless of their nationality. However, the amount does change depending on the country of origin, with EU fees being typically lower than those for non-EU.

==Further education==

Further education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education. Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies, both ad-hoc and statutory. Typical areas included are craft and trade apprenticeships, childcare, farming, retail, and tourism. These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition. There are many different types of further education awards, known as Post Leaving Certificates.

The Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) conferred awards in the extra-university system. Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions, and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalised to restore confidence. There are a number of schemes enabling progression for holders of QQI awards to universities and institutes of technology. QQI awards carry points that can be used to access higher education.

==Grade inflation==
Ireland has a higher proportion of third-level graduates than any other EU country. At the same time, the proportion of graduates with first-class honours has reached record levels. There is disagreement about whether this increase is due to improved methods of instructing increasingly motivated students, or simple grade inflation. President Michael D. Higgins believes that it is due to grade inflation, and has expressed concern about the continued quality and value of university degrees. Whatever the reason might be, employers increasingly examine graduates&#x27; extracurricular activities, work experiences, and soft skills as they search for the most able applicants.

<text>Sergei Natanovich Bernstein (, sometimes Romanized as ; 5 March 1880 – 26 October 1968) was a Ukrainian and Soviet mathematician of Jewish origin known for contributions to partial differential equations, differential geometry, probability theory, and approximation theory.

== Life ==
Bernstein was born into the Jewish family of prominent Ukrainian physiologist Nathaniel Bernstein in Odessa. Sergei was brought up in Odessa but his father died on 4 February 1891 just before he was eleven years old. He graduated from high school in 1898. After this, following his mother&#x27;s wishes, he went with his elder sister to Paris. Bernstein&#x27;s sister studied biology in Paris and did not return to Ukraine but worked at the Pasteur Institute. 
After one year studying mathematics at the Sorbonne, Bernstein decided that he would rather become an engineer and entered the École supérieure d&#x27;électricité. However, he continued to be interested in mathematics and spent three terms at the University of Göttingen, beginning in the autumn of 1902, where his studies were supervised by David Hilbert.
Bernstein returned to Paris and submitted his doctoral dissertation &quot;Sur la nature analytique des solutions des équations aux dérivées partielles du second ordre&quot; to the Sorbonne in the spring of 1904. He returned to Russia in 1905 and taught at Kharkiv University from 1908 to 1933. He was made an ordinary professor in 1920. Bernstein later worked at the Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Leningrad, and also taught at the University and Polytechnic Institute. From January 1939, Bernstein also worked also at Moscow University. He and his wife were evacuated to Borovoe, Kazakhstan in 1941. From 1943 he worked at the Mathematical Institute in Moscow, and edited Chebyshev’s complete works. In 1947 he was dismissed from the university and became head of the Department of Constructive Function Theory at the Steklov Institute. He died in Moscow in 1968.

==Work==

===Partial differential equations===

In his doctoral dissertation, submitted in 1904 to the Sorbonne, Bernstein solved Hilbert&#x27;s nineteenth problem on the analytic solution of elliptic differential equations. His later work was devoted to Dirichlet&#x27;s boundary problem for non-linear equations of elliptic type, where, in particular, he introduced a priori estimates.

===Probability theory===

In 1917, Bernstein suggested the first axiomatic foundation of probability theory, based on the underlying algebraic structure. It was later superseded by the measure-theoretic approach of Kolmogorov.

In the 1920s, he introduced a method for proving limit theorems for sums of dependent random variables.

===Approximation theory===
Through his application of Bernstein polynomials, he laid the foundations of constructive function theory, a field studying the connection between smoothness properties of a function and its approximations by polynomials. In particular, he proved the Weierstrass approximation theorem and Bernstein&#x27;s theorem (approximation theory). Bernstein polynomials also form the mathematical basis for Bézier curves, which later became important in computer graphics.

==International Congress of Mathematicians==
Bernstein was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Cambridge, England in 1912 and in Bologna in 1928 and a plenary speaker at the ICM in Zurich. His plenary address &quot;Sur les liaisons entre quantités aléatoires&quot; was read by Bohuslav Hostinsky.

<doc id="976525" wikidata="Q78791" url="?curid=976525" title="Egon Kisch">
<text>Egon Erwin Kisch (29 April 1885 – 31 March 1948) was an Austro-Hungarian and Czechoslovak writer and journalist, who wrote in German. He styled himself &quot;Der Rasende Reporter&quot; (The Racing Reporter) for his countless travels to the far corners of the globe and his equally numerous articles produced in a relatively short time (&quot;Hetzjagd durch die Zeit&quot;, 1925), Kisch was noted for his development of literary reportage, his opposition to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi regime, and his Communism.

== Biography ==
Kisch was born into a wealthy German-speaking Sephardi Jewish family in Prague, at that time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and began his journalistic career as a reporter for &quot;Bohemia&quot;, a Prague German-language newspaper, in 1906. In 1910, &quot;Bohemia&quot; began publishing a weekly column of Kisch&#x27;s essays. “Prague Forays” ran for more than a year and, along with several books containing reprinted and original material, made Kisch a local celebrity. These feuilletons, which consisted of he called &quot;little novels&quot; about the city, were characterised by an interest in prisons, work houses, and the lives of the poor of Prague. His style was inspired by Jan Neruda, Émile Zola and Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;. Before World War I, he uncovered the spy scandal involving Alfred Redl, which he published anonymously at the time.

At the outbreak of World War I, Kisch was called up for military service and became a corporal in the Austrian army. He fought on the front line in Serbia and the Carpathians and his wartime experiences were later recorded in &quot;Schreib das auf, Kisch!&quot; (&quot;Write That Down, Kisch!&quot;) (1929). He was briefly imprisoned in 1916 for publishing reports from the front that criticised the Austrian military&#x27;s conduct of the war, but nonetheless later served in the army&#x27;s press quarters along with fellow writers Franz Werfel and Robert Musil.

=== Communist ===
The war radicalised Kisch. He deserted in October 1918 as the war came to an end and played a leading role in the abortive left-wing revolution in Vienna in November of that year. Werfel&#x27;s novel &quot;Barbara oder die Frömmigkeit&quot; (1929) portrays the events of this period and Kisch was the inspiration for one of the novel&#x27;s characters. Although the revolution failed, in 1919 Kisch became a member of the Austrian Communist Party and remained a Communist for the rest of his life.

Between 1921 and 1930 Kisch, though a citizen of Czechoslovakia, lived primarily in Berlin, where his work found a new and appreciative audience. In books of collected journalism such as &quot;Der rasende Reporter&quot; (&quot;The Whirling Reporter&quot;) (1924), he cultivated the image of a witty, gritty, daring reporter always on the move, a cigarette clamped doggedly between his lips. His work and his public persona found an echo in the artistic movement of Neue Sachlichkeit, a major strand in the culture of the Weimar Republic.

From 1925 onwards Kisch was a speaker and operative of the communist international and a senior figure in the publishing empire of the West European branch of the Comintern run by communist propagandist Willi Münzenberg. In 1928 Kisch was one of the founders of the Association of Proletarian-Revolutionary Authors.

Through the late twenties and early thirties, Kisch wrote a series of books chronicling his journeys to the Russian SFSR, the U.S.A., Soviet Central Asia and China. These later works are more strongly informed by Kisch&#x27;s communist politics. Whereas in his earlier collections of reportage he had explicitly stated that a reporter should remain impartial, Kisch came to feel that it was necessary for a writer to engage politically with what he was reporting on.

=== Exile ===
On 28 February 1933, the day after the Reichstag fire, Kisch was one of many prominent opponents of Nazism to be arrested. He was briefly imprisoned in Spandau Prison, but as a Czechoslovak citizen, was expelled from Germany. His works were banned and burnt in Germany, but he continued to write for the Czech and émigré German press, bearing witness to the horrors of the Nazi takeover.

In the years between the Machtergreifung and the outbreak of World War II, Kisch continued to travel widely to report and to speak publicly in the anti-fascist cause.

=== Reichstag Fire counter-trial and exclusion from Britain ===
Following the Reichstag Fire Trial organised by the Nazi government to lay the blame for the fire on Communist opponents, a counter-trial was organized in 1933 in London by a group of lawyers, democrats and other anti-Nazi groups under the aegis of German Communist émigrés. Kisch was to be a witness at the counter trial but was refused leave to land in the United Kingdom because of his &quot;known subversive activities&quot;.

=== Attempted exclusion from Australia ===

Kisch&#x27;s visit to Australia as a delegate to the All-Australian Congress Against War and Fascism in 1934 was later chronicled in his book &quot;Landung in Australien&quot; (&quot;Australian Landfall&quot;) (1937).

The right-wing Australian government refused Kisch entry from the ship &quot;Strathaird&quot; at Fremantle and Melbourne because of his previous exclusion from the UK. Kisch then took matters into his own hands. He jumped five metres from the deck of his ship onto the quayside at Melbourne, breaking his leg in the process. He was bundled back on board but this dramatic action mobilised the Australian left in support of Kisch. When the &quot;Strathaird&quot; docked in Sydney, proceedings were taken against the Captain on the grounds that he was illegally detaining Kisch. Justice H. V. Evatt ordered that Kisch be released. Under the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, visitors could be refused entry if they failed a dictation test in any European language. As soon as Kisch was released, he was re-arrested and was one of the very few Europeans to be given the test; he was tested in Scottish Gaelic because it was thought he might pass if tested in other European languages. The officer who tested him had grown up in northern Scotland but did not have a particularly good grasp of Scottish Gaelic himself. In the High Court case of &quot;R v Wilson; ex parte Kisch&quot;, the court found that Scottish Gaelic was not within the fair meaning of the Act, and overturned Kisch&#x27;s convictions for being an illegal immigrant.

On 17 February 1935, Kisch addressed a crowd of 18,000 in the Sydney Domain warning of the dangers of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi regime, of another war and of concentration camps.

=== Spain, France, the United States and Mexico ===
In 1937 and 1938, Kisch was in Spain, where left-wingers from across the world had been drawn by the Spanish Civil War. He travelled across the country, speaking in the Republican cause, and his reports from the front line were widely published.

Following the Munich Agreement of 1938 and the subsequent Nazi occupation of Bohemia six months later, Kisch was unable to return to the country of his birth. Once war broke out, Paris, which he had made his main home since 1933, also became too dangerous for an outspoken Jewish communist whose native land no longer existed. In late 1939, Kisch and his wife Gisela sailed for New York where, once again, he was initially denied entry. He eventually landed at Ellis Island on 28 December, but as he only had a transit visa moved on to Mexico in October 1940.

He remained in Mexico for the next five years, one of a circle of European communist refugees, notable among them Anna Seghers and Ludwig Renn and the German-Czech writer Lenka Reinerová. He continued to write, producing a book on Mexico and a memoir, &quot;Marktplatz der Sensationen&quot; (&quot;Sensation Fair&quot;) (1941). In this period of exile, Kisch&#x27;s work regularly returned to the themes of his Prague home and his Jewish roots and in March 1946 (after troubles in securing a Czechoslovak visa) he was able to return to his birthplace. Immediately after the return he started to travel around the country and work as a journalist again.

=== Legacy ===

Kisch died of a stroke two years after his return to Prague, shortly after the Communist party seized complete power. Kisch is buried in the Vinohrady Cemetery, Prague, Czech Republic.

After his death, Kisch&#x27;s life and work were held up as exemplary in the GDR. The attitude to both in West Germany was more complicated due to his communism. Nonetheless, when &quot;Stern&quot; magazine founded a prestigious award for German journalism in 1977, it was named the Egon Erwin Kisch Prize in his honour.

Kisch&#x27;s work as a writer and communist journalist inspired Australian left wing intellectuals and writers such as Katharine Susannah Prichard, E. J. Brady, Vance and Nettie Palmer and Louis Esson. This group formed the nucleus of what later became the Writers League, drawing on the example of Egon Kisch’s own journalistic dedication to reportage.

Kisch has appeared as a character in novels by Australian authors. Without naming him, his visit to Australia, the leap from the ship and the court case challenging the validity of the language test are mentioned in Kylie Tennant&#x27;s &quot;Ride on Stranger (novel)&quot; (1943). He is a minor character in Frank Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Power Without Glory&quot; (1950), which was filmed for television in (1976), and plays a central, if fictionalised, role in Nicholas Hasluck&#x27;s &quot;Our Man K&quot; (1999). He appears in Sulari Gentill&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Paving the New Road&quot; (2012) along with other real persons such as Nancy Wake and Unity Mitford.

<text>An outline, also called a hierarchical outline, is a list arranged to show hierarchical relationships and is a type of tree structure. An outline is used to present the main points (in sentences) or topics (terms) of a given subject. Each item in an outline may be divided into additional sub-items. If an organizational level in an outline is to be sub-divided, it shall have at least two subcategories, although one subcategory is acceptable on the third and fourth levels, as advised by major style manuals in current use. An outline may be used as a drafting tool of a document, or as a summary of the content of a document or of the knowledge in an entire field. It is not to be confused with the general context of the term &quot;outline&quot;, which is a summary or overview of a subject presented verbally or written in prose (for example, &quot;The Outline of History&quot; is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.

A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course&#x27;s syllabus.

Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof. Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a &quot;bare outline&quot;.

Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document&#x27;s coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer&#x27;s notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.

A software program designed for processing outlines is called an outliner.

== Types of outlines ==

Outlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an outliner.

=== By style ===

There are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.

==== A sample topic outline application: An outline of human knowledge ====

Propædia is the historical attempt of the Encyclopædia Britannica to present a hierarchical &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot; in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot; was a project by Mortimer Adler. Propædia had three levels, 10 &quot;Parts&quot; at the top level, 41 &quot;Divisions&quot; at the middle level and 167 &quot;Sections&quot; at the bottom level, numbered, for example, &quot;1. Matter and Energy&quot;, &quot;1.1 Atoms&quot;, &quot;1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Sync&quot;.

=== By prefixing used ===

A feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to section numbers, an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.

==== Bare outlines ====

Bare outlines include no prefixes.

==== Alphanumeric outline ====

An &quot;alphanumeric outline&quot; includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of Roman numerals for the top level, upper-case letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, Arabic numerals for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level. For further levels, the order is started over again. Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:

Some call the Roman numerals &quot;A-heads&quot; (for &quot;A-level headings&quot;), the upper-case letters, &quot;B-heads&quot;, and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.

If more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.

The scheme recommended by the &quot;MLA Handbook&quot;, and the &quot;Purdue Online Writing Lab&quot;, among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets) – I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a) – and does not specify any lower levels, though &quot;(i)&quot; is usually next. In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses – 1) a) i) – but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style, but the &quot;APA Publication Manual&quot; does not address outline formatting at all.

A very different style recommended by &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, based on the practice of the United States Congress in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified): I. A. 1. &quot;a&quot;) (1) (&quot;a&quot;) &quot;i&quot;) – capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required). Because of its use in the US Code and other US law books, many American lawyers consequently use this outline format.

Another alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five – I) A) 1) a) i) – and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five – (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).

Many oft-cited style guides besides the &quot;APA Publication Manual&quot;, including the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, the &quot;NYT Manual&quot;, Fowler, &quot;The Guardian&quot; Style Guide, and Strunk &amp; White, are silent on the topic.

One side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, &quot;I.&quot; may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3. So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.

==== Decimal outline ====

The &quot;decimal outline&quot; format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:

A first subsection may be numbered 0 rather than 1 (as in 2.0 Career opportunities) if it is an introduction or similar to the following subsections.

ISO 2145 describes a standard for decimal outlines.

=== By specialized purpose ===

Special types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.

==== Reverse outline ====

A &quot;reverse outline&quot; is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.

==== Integrated outline ====

An &quot;integrated outline&quot; is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper (literature review, research paper, thesis or dissertation). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author&#x27;s last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources. These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.

An integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with writer&#x27;s block because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.

== Applications ==

Outlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.

=== Composition ===

&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s manual for writers and editors&quot; (1998, p. 290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a &#x27;standard outline&#x27;, presented as a regular table of contents from a refined tree-like &#x27;hierarchical outline&#x27;, stating that &quot;such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to.&quot;

Writers of fiction and creative nonfiction, such as Jon Franklin, may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with free writing.

Preparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly research paper, literature review, thesis or dissertation. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.

=== Summarization ===

In addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can be presented as a work&#x27;s table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work. The &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot; from the 15th edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see Outline of chess, Outline of Mars, and Outline of knowledge).

Professors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.

Outlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.

=== Personal information management ===

Outlines, especially those used within an outliner, can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.

== Outliners ==
An outliner (or &quot;outline processor&quot;) is a specialized type of word processor used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing hierarchically arranged text in an outline&#x27;s tree structure. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called &quot;nodes&quot;, which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a family tree. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be collapsed or expanded to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree. So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired. This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more. In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.

Outliners may be used in content creation instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for writing computer programs. They are also used for goal and task management (including personal information management and project management), and for writing books and movie scripts.

The graphical counterpart to outliners are mind mappers.

<text>Belitung (Belitung Malay: &quot;Belitong&quot;, formerly Billiton) is an island on the east coast of Sumatra, Indonesia in the Java Sea. It covers (including offshore islands such as Mendanau Island), and had a population of 309,097 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 320,500. Administratively, it forms two regencies (Belitung Regency and East Belitung Regency) within the province of Bangka-Belitung Islands. The island is known for its pepper and for its tin. It was in the possession of the United Kingdom from 1812 until Britain ceded control of the island to the Netherlands in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Its main town is Tanjung Pandan. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has declared 17 tourist attractions in the Belitung Geopark as world geoparks.

==Demography==
The population was 262,357 at the 2010 Census and 309,097 in the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 320,500. The population is centered in several small towns; the largest are Tanjung Pandan in the west and Manggar in the east, which are the respective capitals of the two Regencies (Belitung and Belitung Timur) into which the island is administratively divided. While ethnic Bangka Malays people make up the largest percentage along with Chinese people, Belitung has significant populations of Bugis, Sundanese, and Javanese people who formerly worked for the Dutch, mining tin. There is also a small population of Madurese who were settled there in the Suharto era transmigration.

==Religion==
Before the arrival of Dutch missionaries, the island&#x27;s inhabitants and most of the Indonesian archipelago had already converted from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Animism to Islam due to the work of Chinese Muslim traders. As a result, Christian churches were unable to gain considerable numbers of followers. 
Today, Belitung is a religiously diverse island. Sunni Islam is the most widely practiced religion, with sizeable minorities of Buddhists, Christians and Confucianists. 

==Transportation==

On Belitung island, the only airport is in Belitung Regency; that is, the H.A.S. Hanandjoeddin International Airport maintains a series of connecting flights to Pangkal Pinang Airport, as well as a plane to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. International flights via Singapore&#x27;s Changi International Airport are through Garuda Indonesia airlines.

Flag carrier Garuda Indonesia has four direct flights from Singapore. The Singapore-Tanjung Pandan direct flight operates four times weekly – departing at 5:20 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 5:30 pm on Sundays.

Belitung Island has four ports; three in Belitung Regency and one in East Belitung Regency, serving cargo ships and ferry ships.

Online taxi services (such as Gojek and Grab) are available, as well as standard taxicabs, the taxi bandara (airport taxi) and commonly-hailed street taxis.

==Geography==

Belitung is a medium-sized island (at about ), also encompassing smaller adjacent islands, of which Mendanau Island to the west is the largest. Belitung consists of moderately-rugged terrain and several hills. The highest point is Mount Tajam, with a height of less than . The maritime boundaries of the province include Bangka Strait to the west, Karimata Strait to the east, Natuna Sea to the north, and the Java Sea to the south. The Gaspar Strait runs north–south (between the islands of Bangka and Belitung), connecting the Java Sea to the Natuna Sea and, further north, the South China Sea. Its surrounding turquoise blue seas are moderately calm and shallow, making for great sailing, snorkeling and swimming. Belitung is popular for its abstract granite boulders and brilliant, white-sand beaches in Tanjung Tinggi, Tanjung Kelayang, Tanjung Binga and Lengkuas island.

==Economy==

Belitung is a source of tin, clay, iron ore and silica sands. The Dutch mining company NV Billiton Maatschappij derives its name from the island&#x27;s name. Billiton merged with BHP in 2001 to form BHP Billiton.

The island is also a producer of fishery products, pepper, coconut, and palm oil. People work as farmers, fishermen and miners. The island is easily accessible with eight daily 1-hour flights from Jakarta and 2 daily flights, with duration of 30 minutes and 50 minutes each, from Pangkal Pinang.

The white sand beaches and offshore islands are helping tourism to become a larger part of the economy.

===Tourist destinations===
The main tourist destinations are beaches and offshore islands/islets. The beaches are Tanjung Tinggi Beach and Tanjung Kelayang Beach, both of which have clear blue water, sand, and rocky beaches. The islands/islets are Batu Berlayar Island, which is mostly granite, Pasir Island, which is a tidal island made of sand (= pasir in Indonesian), Bird Islet (Pulau Burong, accessed from Tanjung Binga beach on foot at low tide, Lengkuas Island, which is the home of a 129-year-old lighthouse and a good place for snorkeling, and Babi Island and Kelayang Islet.

<text>The Plansee Group (named after Lake Plansee; company name: &quot;Plansee Holding AG)&quot; is an Austrian company based in Reutte that specialises in the powder metallurgical production of materials (molybdenum and tungsten) and in processing them into tools and moulded parts. The Plansee Group is a private company and is considered a global market leader.

== History ==

Paul Schwarzkopf (born 13 April 1886), an industrial entrepreneur and pioneer in the powder metallurgy field, founded Metallwerk Plansee GmbH in 1921. Schwarzkopf, who was searching for a suitable production site close to a hydropower station at the time by placing a newspaper advertisement, ultimately decided in favour of Reutte. Between 1929 and 1931, the company started to produce carbides and hard materials using new and specially developed approaches.

In 1938, Schwarzkopf was expropriated following the annexation of Austria to the German Reich, as he was considered to be Jewish under the Nuremberg laws and decided to flee from the National Socialists to the USA. As a result, the company was part of Deutsche Edelstahlwerke AG between 1938 and 1952.

In 1939, Schwarzkopf founded the American Electro Metal Corporation, today operating as Plansee USA LLC. Schwarzkopf continued to conduct research in the field of powder metallurgy in exile and returned to Europe in 1947. In 1952, Paul Schwarzkopf became the sole proprietor of Metallwerk Plansee GmbH again and expanded the company into an international enterprise.

Paul Schwarzkopf died in his home of Reutte in 1970. The company was subsequently run by relatives and non-family managers.

In the early 1980s, the Plansee Group comprised 14 companies worldwide. In 1987, the operations of Plansee High Performance Materials and Plansee Hard Metal Tools (Plansee Tizit) became separate divisions.

In 1996, a fire broke out in the sintering plant of Plansee Tizit in Reutte. Hilde Schwarzkopf, who represented the family’s interests on the Supervisory Board from 1978 on and was referred to as the &quot;Grande Dame of Tyrolean Industry&quot;, appeared before the workforce shortly thereafter, announcing her commitment to the reconstruction of the site despite the damage it had incurred.

In 2002, the Plansee Group merged its division Plansee Hard Metal Tools with the Luxembourg company Cerametal, forming the new company Ceratizit. The Plansee Group owns a 50 percent stake in Ceratizit. A joint venture had previously existed between Cerametal and Plansee in 1948.

In 2008, the Plansee Group acquired the division GTP from Osram Sylvania. Since 2011, the Plansee Group has successively acquired business interests in the Chilean molybdenum and rhenium producer Molymet.

Today, the Plansee Group is divided into three divisions - Plansee High Performance Materials, Ceratizit Hard Metals &amp; Tools and Global Tungsten &amp; Powders - and holds interests in one company, which is Molymet.

The Group operates 49 production sites worldwide on three continents and sales offices in 50 countries.

== Corporate structure ==
Plansee Holding AG maintains the following divisions and shareholdings:

=== Plansee High Performance Materials ===
Plansee High Performance Materials develops and produces semi-finished products and components made from molybdenum, tungsten as well as tungsten-based heavy metal alloys. These metals are required in applications such as the coating industry, energy transmission, the lighting industry, high-temperature furnace construction, semi-conductor production, the electronics industry and medical technology. These metals are used where conventional metals reach their physical limits.

In September 2017, Plansee founded the material search platform Matmatch. The platform allowed material experts or buyers worldwide to learn about more than 80,000 known materials and contact potential suppliers. In 2024, it was announced on LinkedIn that Matmatch was going offline, with no further information available as to whether it would come back online again in the future.

=== Ceratizit Hard Metals &amp; Tools ===
Ceratizit S.A. is a public limited company based in Mamer, Luxembourg – a company in which Plansee Holding AG holds a 50 percent stake.

Ceratizit develops and produces tools for machining and wear parts for industrial production from hard metal and other hard materials. After a series of smaller acquisitions of solid carbide tool manufacturers, Ceratizit acquired the Komet Group in October 2017, a manufacturer of precision tools.

=== Global Tungsten &amp; Powders ===
Global Tungsten &amp; Powders (GTP), headquartered in the USA, is one of the leading producers of tungsten powder. Tungsten ore concentrates are processed into ammonium paratungstate (APT) and then into tungsten metal powder, tungsten carbide and ready-to-press powders. GTP has a subsidiary, Bruntál (Czech Republic), and was integrated into the Plansee Group on 1 August 2008 following approval by the antitrust authority, becoming the fourth division at that time.

On 12 June 2015, GTP acquired Tikomet in Finland, a company specialised in the recycling of hard metal scrap.

The division PMG Sinterformteile was sold in 2011. Holding functions of the Plansee Group are pooled in Plansee Group Service GmbH, based in Breitenwang/Reutte.

=== Molymet ===
The Plansee Group holds a 20 percent stake in the publicly traded &quot;Molibdenos y Metalas S.A.&quot; (Molymet for short), based in Santiago de Chile. Molymet specialises in the processing of molybdenum ore concentrates and rhenium.

== Products ==
The companies of the Plansee Group cover the entire powder metallurgy process chain. The extracted ore is processed into pure metal powder. The powder is then worked into semi-finished products and tool blanks using powder metallurgical methods – including pressing, sintering and forming – and is subsequently processed mechanically. Depending on the requirement, the Plansee Group supplies metal powder, semi-finished products or ready-to-install components made from refractory and hard metals. Since resources are scarce and expensive, the first step - procuring the raw materials by cooperating with mines or recycling facilities - is becoming increasingly important.

The Plansee Group primarily processes molybdenum and tungsten, but also other refractory metals such as tantalum, niobium and chromium as well as their alloys and composites.

Sales markets include consumer electronics, the automotive industry, mechanical engineering, the construction industry, energy engineering, medical technology, the semiconductor industry and aerospace.

== Social commitment ==

=== Paul Schwarzkopf Foundation ===
The foundation named after the company founder Paul Schwarzkopf, based in Reutte, supports adolescents from economically disadvantaged families, assisting with their training and continuing education.
=== Plansee concerts ===
The concerts were initiated by Hilde and Walter Schwarzkopf and have taken place on a regular basis since 1975. They are organised and financed by the Plansee Group. A season includes five predominantly classical concerts. The concert hall built on the Plansee Group premises in Reutte in 1978 serves as the canteen for employees during the day.

== Plansee Seminar ==
The Plansee Seminar is an international conference on the development and production of refractory metals and hard materials. Experts from the realms of research, science and industry discuss applications, materials, production technologies as well as testing and characterisation methods. The Plansee Seminar is held every four years and is organised by the Plansee Group. The first Plansee Seminar took place in Reutte in 1952.

<text>A film treatment (or simply treatment) is a piece of prose, typically the step between scene cards (index cards) and the first draft of a screenplay for a motion picture, television program, or radio play. It is generally longer and more detailed than an outline (or one-page synopsis), and it may include details of directorial style that an outline omits. Treatments read like a short story, but are told in the present tense and describe events as they happen. A treatment may also be created in the process of adapting a novel, play, or other pre-existing work into a screenplay.

==Original draft treatment==
The original draft treatment is created during the writing process and is generally long and detailed. It consists of full-scene outlines put together. Usually there are between thirty and eighty standard letter size or A4 pages (Courier New 12 point), with an average of about forty pages. For example, the draft treatment of &quot;The Terminator&quot; is forty-eight pages long.

More elaborate forms of the draft treatment are the step outline and the scriptment.

==Presentation treatment==
The presentation treatment is created as presentation material. Scene descriptions are written out on index cards (or a digital equivalent) and only have the essential and important story events that make up the scenes. The scene cards are arranged and rearranged until the optimum structure is worked out. It is the full story in its simplest form, moving from the concept, to the theme, to the character, to the detailed synopsis of about four to eight pages of master scenes.

Presentation treatments are used to show how the production notes have been incorporated into the screenplay for the director and production executives to look over, or to leave behind as a presentation note after a sales pitch.

The presentation treatment is the appropriate treatment to submit if a script submission requires one. They are usually at least three, but fewer than thirty, pages in length, with most being of seven to twelve pages.

==Usage==
Treatments are widely used within the motion picture industry as selling documents to outline story and character aspects of a planned screenplay, whereas outlines are generally produced as part of the development process. Screenwriters may use a treatment to initially pitch a screenplay, but may also use a treatment to sell a concept they are pitching without a completed screenplay.

<doc id="976563" wikidata="Q2131336" url="?curid=976563" title="Raoul Villain">
<text>Raoul Villain (19 September 1885 – 17 September 1936) was a French nationalist. He is primarily remembered for his assassination of the French socialist leader Jean Jaurès on 31 July 1914, in Paris. Villain was acquitted by a jury of peers in 1919 and later fled to the Balearic island of Ibiza, where he was killed during the first stages of the Spanish Civil War.

==Early life and background==
Villain was born in Reims, Marne, France on 19 September 1885. As a 29-year-old student in archeology at the &quot;École du Louvre&quot;, he was a member of the &quot;Ligue des jeunes amis de l&#x27;Alsace-Lorraine&quot; (&quot;League of Young Friends of Alsace-Lorraine&quot;), a nationalist student group.

After France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine were annexed by Germany. This was a source of anger and resentment in France, causing many to feel that a new war with Germany was in order to recover both territories and French pride. Therefore, many like Villain were opposed to the pacifist policies of Jean Jaurès. Villain lived for some time in England, at Loughton, where he stayed with Mrs Annie Francis, who described him, according to &quot;The Observer&quot; on 6 June 1915, as &quot;a gentle and very kind man&quot;.

==Attack on Jaurès and result==
Villain focused on Jaurès, bought a revolver and began stalking him, scribbling incoherent notes about the socialist leader&#x27;s habits into his pocket-book. At about 21:40 on Friday, 31 July 1914, Villain fired two bullets through a window embrasure into Jaurès&#x27; head while his victim was having supper with his contributors in Le Croissant at the corner of Rue Montmartre and Rue du Croissant.

The next day, posters went up all over France announcing the general mobilization, and war was declared three days after Jaurès&#x27;s death. What would be World War I began.

Incarcerated for the duration of the war, Villain was brought to trial in 1919. He was acquitted by a jury of peers on 29 March 1919, and Anatole France wrote in &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;: &quot;Workers! ... A monstrous verdict proclaims that the assassination of Jaurès is not a crime...&quot;. Jaurès&#x27;s wife, as plaintiff, was ordered to pay the court costs.

==After being acquitted==
After having briefly been arrested in 1920 in Paris after trying to pass some false currency, Villain fled to Cala de Sant Vicent, Ibiza in the Balearic Islands off Spain. Receiving some money through an inheritance, he fled France and arrived in Ibiza. Villain thought that, by hiding out in the remote northeastern corner of Ibiza, he could live anonymously and be forgotten. In 1933, the Bay of Cala de San Vicent was a very quiet backwater with no development; there was not even a road into the valley. Villain decided to make his home there. Using local labour and help from Paul René Gauguin, the grandson of Paul Gauguin, he built a house from concrete and had almost finished the building by August 1936.

On 13 September, a small detachment of soldiers arrived on the beach of &quot;Cala de San Vicent&quot; by rowboat. Eyewitnesses reported that they thought that they may have been anarchists of the FAI. These soldiers were part of a larger detachment. The force had arrived on the island to re-secure it following the mini-coup which had been orchestrated by the Nationalists under the command of Infantry Commander Juli Mestre. Villain had been away visiting a French woman in Santa Eulària des Riu when the soldiers arrived, but quickly returned home when he heard of their arrival. Feeling vulnerable, he feared that the soldiers would steal his valuables, which he had stashed in the unfinished house. Despite being repeatedly warned by his neighbours not to go back down to the cove, he still went home.

==Death==
The officer and troops who arrived on the beach that day seemed very suspicious of this Frenchman, who also antagonised the officer with his explanation of why he had set a crucifix on the hill behind his house. Apart from this outward show of religious zeal, the officer was also suspicious of where Villain had been that day, and decided to confine him to his house. He was considered to be a fascist and a spy and, as such, a threat to their plans to reoccupy the island.

On the afternoon of 17 September 1936, three bombers from the Italian Air Force had flown along the coast over Cala de Sant Vicent and bombed the town of Ibiza, which could be heard even that far up the coast. It is thought that the troops, on hearing the sounds of the attack, decided to return to the capital and tried to take Villain and his valuables with them. He reacted violently to this, and as a consequence was shot in the back, with the bullet exiting via his throat. Villain had only been wounded, but the officer in charge warned the villagers that had come down to see what had happened, not to assist or disturb him. Villain lay alone on the sand for two days until he died. The locals then placed his body in a makeshift coffin, draped it in a French Tricolour they found in his house, and buried him in the cemetery at nearby Sant Vicent de sa Cala.

<doc id="976568" wikidata="Q4048863" url="?curid=976568" title="SPARCstation 1">
<text>The SPARCstation 1 (Sun 4/60, code-named &quot;Campus&quot;) is the first of the SPARCstation series of SPARC-based computer workstations sold by Sun Microsystems. The design originated in 1987 by a Sun spin-off company, UniSun, which was soon re-acquired. The SPARCstation 1 has a distinctive slim enclosure (a square 3-inch-high &quot;pizza box&quot;) and was first sold in April 1989, with Sun&#x27;s support ending in 1995.

Based on an LSI Logic RISC CPU running at 20 MHz, with a Weitek 3170 (or 3172) FPU coprocessor, it was the fourth Sun computer (after the 4/260, 4/110 and 4/280) to use the SPARC architecture and the first of the sun4c architecture. The motherboard has three SBus slots, built-in AUI Ethernet, 8 kHz audio, and a 5 MB/s SCSI-1 bus. The basic display runs at in 256 colours, and monitors shipped with the computer were 16 to 19 inch greyscale or colour.

Designed for ease of production to compete with high-end PCs or Macs, its principal competitors were the IBM PS/2 Model 80, the NeXT Computer, and Sun&#x27;s own 3/80. It sold for between about with no hard disks, to US$20,000 — and in the first year around 35,000 units were sold.

== Design ==
The SPARCstation 1 features several distinctive design and packaging elements driven internally by system designer Andy Bechtolsheim and externally by design house frog design. Bechtolsheim specified that the motherboard would be the size of a sheet of paper and the SBus expansion cards would be the size of index cards, resulting in an extremely compact footprint. The external design motif includes dot-patterned cooling vents on the side which are echoed by a &quot;dimple&quot; pattern on the front face, and &quot;Sun purple&quot; feet.

== Memory ==
The SPARCstation 1 takes 30-pin SIMMs in groups of four. It can take either 1 MB or 4 MB SIMMs as long as the size is consistent within a bank. 
There are a total of four memory banks, which can give a total of 64 MB of memory. Memory bank 0 (composed of U0311, U0322, U0309, and U0307) should be filled first. If not, the OpenBoot firmware will hang while memory checking.

== Disk drives ==
The SPARCstation 1 has space for up to two hard drives and one floppy drive internally. The machine will take any 50-pin SCSI-2 hard drive, but the OpenBoot firmware will not boot from any partition which starts or ends after 1024 MB.
The floppy drive, like the Macintosh&#x27;s, is unusual in that it has an electromechanical eject mechanism rather than the conventional eject button, and therefore must be ejected by the operating system or OpenBoot. 
The machine can connect to any SCSI CD drive, via either the SCSI connector on the back or by connecting it to any spare internal SCSI connector via a 50-pin cable.

== Network support ==

The SPARCstation 1 comes with an on-board AMD Lance Ethernet chipset and a 15-pin AUI connector, which can connect to 10BASE2, 10BASE5 or 10BASE-T via an appropriate transceiver. The OpenBoot ROM is able to boot from network, using RARP and TFTP. Like all other SPARCstation systems, the SPARCstation 1 holds system information such as MAC address and host id (serial number) in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot.

== NVRAM ==
The SPARCstation 1 uses an M48T02 battery-backed RTC with RAM chip which handles the real time clock and boot parameter storage. A problem with this chip is that the battery is internal, which means the entire chip must be replaced when its battery runs out. As all SPARCstation 1s made are now older than the battery life of this chip, a substantial number of these systems now refuse to boot. Additionally, the SPARCstation 1 design used the reserved bits in the M48T02&#x27;s NVRAM in a non-standard way; since later revisions of the M48T02 chip exert stricter control over these bits, a current M48T02 will store the NVRAM data, but the RTC will not function correctly and the system may fail to auto-boot.

Due to incompatibilities with modern M48T02s, it is common to modify failed NVRAMs by cutting into the encapsulation and patching in a new battery. It is also possible to replace the entire encapsulation, which also contains a 32.768 kHz clock crystal.

== Operating systems ==
The SPARCstation 1, 1+, IPC and SLC can run the following operating systems:
* SunOS 4.0.3c through 5.7 (Solaris 7)
* Linux (Modern versions may have trouble with the limited amount of memory in these machines)
* NetBSD 1.0 onwards
* OpenBSD - All versions up to 5.9 (OpenBSD 5.9 was the last release to support SPARC32)

== Notable uses ==
* Four or five SPARCstation 1 units were used by Game Freak to develop &quot;Pokémon Red and Green&quot;.

== Related computers ==

The SPARCstation 1+ (Sun 4/65) pushed the CPU to a 25 MHz LSI L64801, upgraded the coprocessor to a Weitek 3172 and installed a new SCSI controller.

The SPARCstation IPC (Sun 4/40) is a version of the SPARCstation 1+ in a lunchbox style case and onboard video.

The SPARCstation SLC (Sun 4/20) is a version of the SPARCstation 1+ built into a monitor cabinet, announced in May 1990.

The SPARCstation 2 (Sun 4/75) is the machine&#x27;s successor and was released in November 1990.

<text>The Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program () was a collaborative space program between Russia and the United States that involved American Space Shuttles visiting the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;, Russian cosmonauts flying on the Shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft to allow American astronauts to engage in long-duration expeditions aboard &quot;Mir&quot;.

The project, sometimes called &quot;Phase One&quot;, was intended to allow the United States to learn from Russian experience with long-duration spaceflight and to foster a spirit of cooperation between the two nations and their space agencies, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Russian Space Agency (PKA). The project helped to prepare the way for further cooperative space ventures; specifically, &quot;Phase Two&quot; of the joint project, the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). The program was announced in 1993, the first mission started in 1994 and the project continued until its scheduled completion in 1998. Eleven Space Shuttle missions, a joint Soyuz flight and almost 1,000 cumulative days in space for American astronauts occurred over the course of seven long-duration expeditions. In addition to Space Shuttle launches to &quot;Mir&quot; the United States also fully funded and equipped with scientific equipment the Spektr module (launched in 1995) and the Priroda module (launched in 1996), making them de facto U.S. modules during the duration of the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; program.

During the four-year program, many firsts in spaceflight were achieved by the two nations, including the first American astronaut to launch aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, the largest spacecraft ever to have been assembled at that time in history, and the first American spacewalk using a Russian Orlan spacesuit.

The program was marred by various concerns, notably the safety of &quot;Mir&quot; following a fire, a Russian spacecraft colliding with Spektr rendering it uninhabitable, financial issues with the cash-strapped Russian space program and worries from astronauts about the attitudes of the program administrators. Nevertheless, a large amount of science, expertise in space station construction and knowledge in working in a cooperative space venture was gained from the combined operations, allowing the construction of the ISS to proceed much more smoothly than would have otherwise been the case.

==Background==
The origins of the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program can be traced back to the 1975 Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, that resulted in a joint US/Soviet mission during the détente period of the Cold War and the docking between a US Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. This was followed by the talks between NASA and Intercosmos in the 1970s about a &quot;Shuttle–&quot;Salyut&quot;&quot; program to fly Space Shuttle missions to a &quot;Salyut&quot; space station, with later talks in the 1980s even considering flights of the future Soviet shuttles from the Buran programme to a future US space station – this &quot;Shuttle–&quot;Salyut&quot;&quot; program never materialized however during the existence of the Soviet Intercosmos program.

This changed after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union: the end of Cold War and Space Race resulted in funding for the US modular space station (originally named &quot;Freedom&quot;), which was planned since the early 1980s, being slashed.
Similar budgetary difficulties were being faced by other nations with space station projects, prompting American government officials to start negotiations with partners in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative, multi-national, space station project.
In the Russian Federation, as the successor to much of the Soviet Union and its space program, the deteriorating economic situation in the post-Soviet economic chaos led to growing financial problems of the now Russian space station program. The construction of the Mir-2 space station as a replacement for the aging &quot;Mir&quot; became illusionary, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been built. These developments resulted in bringing the former adversaries together with the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; Program, which would pave the way to the International Space Station, a joint project with several international partners.
In June 1992, American President George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to co-operate on space exploration by signing the &quot;Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes&quot;. This agreement called for setting up a short, joint space project, during which one American astronaut would board the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; and two Russian cosmonauts would board a Space Shuttle.

In September 1993, American Vice-President Al Gore Jr., and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station, which eventually became the International Space Station. They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, that the United States would be heavily involved in the &quot;Mir&quot; project in the years ahead, under the code name &quot;Phase One&quot; (the construction of the ISS being &quot;Phase Two&quot;).

The first Space Shuttle flight to &quot;Mir&quot; was a rendezvous mission without docking on STS-63. This was followed during the course of the project by nine Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; docking missions, from STS-71 to STS-91. The Shuttle rotated crews and delivered supplies, and one mission, STS-74, carried a docking module and a pair of solar arrays to &quot;Mir&quot;. Various scientific experiments were also conducted, both on shuttle flights and long-term aboard the station. The project also saw the launch of two new modules, &quot;Spektr&quot; and &quot;Priroda&quot;, to &quot;Mir&quot;, which were used by American astronauts as living quarters and laboratories to conduct the majority of their science aboard the station. These missions allowed NASA and Roscosmos to learn a great deal about how best to work with international partners in space and how to minimize the risks associated with assembling a large space station in orbit, as would have to be done with the ISS.

The project also served as a political ruse on the part of the American government, providing a diplomatic channel for NASA to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep &quot;Mir&quot; operating, in addition to the Russian space program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained friendly towards the United States.

===Increments===

In addition to the flights of the Shuttle to &quot;Mir&quot;, Phase One also featured seven &quot;Increments&quot; aboard the station, long-duration flights aboard &quot;Mir&quot; by American astronauts. The seven astronauts who took part in the Increments, Norman Thagard, Shannon Lucid, John Blaha, Jerry Linenger, Michael Foale, David Wolf and Andrew Thomas, were each flown in turn to Star City, Russia, to undergo training in various aspects of the operation of &quot;Mir&quot; and the Soyuz spacecraft used for transport to and from the Station. The astronauts also received practice in carrying out spacewalks outside &quot;Mir&quot; and lessons in the Russian language, which would be used throughout their missions to talk with the other cosmonauts aboard the station and Mission Control in Russia, the TsUP.

During their expeditions aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, the astronauts carried out various experiments, including growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds of photographs of the Earth. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks. In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, allowing NASA to learn a great deal about long-duration spaceflight, particularly in the areas of astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews aboard space stations.

===&quot;Mir&quot;===
&quot;Mir&quot; was constructed between 1986 and 1996 and was the world&#x27;s first modular space station. It was the first consistently inhabited long-term research station in space, and previously held the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of ten years. &quot;Mir&quot; purpose was to provide a large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including Intercosmos and Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot;, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and broke apart during atmospheric re-entry.

&quot;Mir&quot; was based upon the Salyut series of space stations previously launched by the Soviet Union (seven Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971), and was mainly serviced by Russian-crewed Soyuz spacecraft and Progress cargo ships. The Buran space shuttle was anticipated to visit &quot;Mir&quot;, but its program was canceled after its first uncrewed spaceflight. Visiting US Space Shuttles used an Androgynous Peripheral Attach System docking collar originally designed for Buran, mounted on a bracket originally designed for use with the American Space Station Freedom.

With the Space Shuttle docked to &quot;Mir&quot;, the temporary enlargements of living and working areas amounted to a complex that was the world&#x27;s largest spacecraft at that time, with a combined mass of .

===Space Shuttle===
The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system that was operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was &quot;Space Transportation System (STS)&quot;, taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development. The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982. In addition to the prototype, whose completion was cancelled, five complete Shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. The Shuttle fleet&#x27;s total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.

The Space Shuttle carried large payloads to various orbits, and, during the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; and ISS programs, provided crew rotation and carried various supplies, modules and pieces of equipment to the stations. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or 10 years&#x27; operational life.

Nine docking missions were flown to &quot;Mir&quot;, from 1995 to 1997 during &quot;Phase One&quot;: Space Shuttle docked seven times to &quot;Mir&quot;, with and each flying one docking mission to &quot;Mir&quot;. As Space Shuttle was the oldest and heaviest of the fleet, it was not suited for efficient operations at &quot;Mir&quot; (and later the ISS&#x27;s) 51.6-degree inclination – &quot;Columbia&quot; was therefore not retrofitted with the necessary external airlock and Orbital Docking System, and never flew to a space station.

==Timeline==
===New cooperation begins (1994)===
Phase One of the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program began on February 3, 1994, with the launch of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on its 18th mission, STS-60. The eight-day mission was the first shuttle flight of that year, the first flight of a Russian cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, aboard the American shuttle, and marked the start of increased cooperation in space for the two nations, 37 years after the Space Race began. Part of an international agreement on human space flight, the mission was the second flight of the Spacehab pressurized module and marked the hundredth &quot;Getaway Special&quot; payload to fly in space. The primary payload for the mission was the Wake Shield Facility (or WSF), a device designed to generate new semiconductor films for advanced electronics. The WSF was flown at the end of &quot;Discovery&quot; robotic arm over the course of the flight. During the mission, the astronauts aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; also carried out various experiments aboard the Spacehab module in the Orbiter&#x27;s payload bay, and took part in a live bi-directional audio and downlink video hookup between themselves and the three cosmonauts on board &quot;Mir&quot;, Valeri Polyakov, Viktor Afanasyev and Yury Usachev (flying &quot;Mir&quot; expeditions LD-4 and EO-15).

===America arrives at &quot;Mir&quot; (1995)===
1995 began with the launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on February 3. Discovery&#x27;s mission, STS-63, was the second Space Shuttle flight in the program and the first flight of the shuttle with a female pilot, Eileen Collins. Referred to as the &quot;near-&quot;Mir&quot;&quot; mission, the eight-day flight saw the first rendezvous of a Space Shuttle with &quot;Mir&quot;, as Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Titov and the rest of &quot;Discovery&quot; crew approached within of &quot;Mir&quot;. Following the rendezvous, Collins performed a flyaround of the station. The mission, a dress rehearsal for the first docked mission in the program, STS-71, also carried out testing of various techniques and pieces of equipment that would be used during the docking missions that followed.
Five weeks after &quot;Discovery&quot; flight, the March 14 launch of Soyuz TM-21 carried expedition EO-18 to &quot;Mir&quot;. The crew consisted of cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov and NASA astronaut Norman Thagard, who became the first American to fly into space aboard the Soyuz spacecraft. During the course of their 115-day expedition, the &quot;Spektr&quot; science module (which served as living and working space for American astronauts) was launched aboard a Proton rocket and docked to &quot;Mir&quot;. Spektr carried more than of research equipment from America and other nations. The expedition&#x27;s crew returned to Earth aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; following the first Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; docking during mission STS-71.

The primary objectives of STS-71, launched on June 27, called for the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; to rendezvous and perform the first docking between an American Space Shuttle and the station. On June 29, &quot;Atlantis&quot; successfully docked with &quot;Mir&quot;, becoming the first US spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. &quot;Atlantis&quot; delivered cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin, who would form the expedition EO-19 crew, and retrieved astronaut Norman Thagard and cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov of the expedition EO-18 crew. &quot;Atlantis&quot; also carried out on-orbit joint US-Russian life sciences investigations aboard a Spacelab module and performed a logistical resupply of the station.

The final Shuttle flight of 1995, STS-74, began with the November 12 launch of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and delivered the Russian-built Docking Module to &quot;Mir&quot;, along with a new pair of solar arrays and other hardware upgrades for the station. The Docking Module was designed to provide more clearance for Shuttles in order to prevent any collisions with &quot;Mir&quot; solar arrays during docking, a problem which had been overcome during STS-71 by relocating the station&#x27;s &quot;Kristall&quot; module to a different location on the station. The module, attached to &quot;Kristall&quot; docking port, prevented the need for this procedure on further missions. During the course of the flight, nearly of water were transferred to &quot;Mir&quot; and experiment samples including blood, urine and saliva were moved to &quot;Atlantis&quot; for return to Earth.

===&quot;Priroda&quot; (1996)===
Continuous US presence aboard &quot;Mir&quot; started in 1996 with the March 22 launch of &quot;Atlantis&quot; on mission STS-76, when the Second Increment astronaut Shannon Lucid was transferred to the station. STS-76 was the third docking mission to &quot;Mir&quot;, which also demonstrated logistics capabilities through deployment of a Spacehab module, and placed experiment packages aboard &quot;Mir&quot; docking module, which marked the first spacewalk which occurred around docked vehicles. The spacewalks, carried out from &quot;Atlantis&quot; crew cabin, provided valuable experience for astronauts in order to prepare for later assembly missions to the International Space Station.

Lucid became the first American woman to live on station, and, following a six-week extension to her Increment due to issues with Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, her 188-day mission set the US single spaceflight record. During Lucid&#x27;s time aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, the &quot;Priroda&quot; module, with about of US science hardware, was docked to &quot;Mir&quot;. Lucid made use of both &quot;Priroda&quot; and &quot;Spektr&quot; to carry out 28 different science experiments and as living quarters.
Her stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot; ended with the flight of &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-79, which launched on September 16. STS-79 was the first Shuttle mission to carry a double Spacehab module. More than of supplies were transferred to &quot;Mir&quot;, including water generated by &quot;Atlantis&quot; fuel cells, and experiments that included investigations into superconductors, cartilage development, and other biology studies. About of experiment samples and equipment were also transferred back from &quot;Mir&quot; to &quot;Atlantis&quot;, making the total transfer the most extensive yet.

This, the fourth docking, also saw John Blaha transferring onto &quot;Mir&quot; to take his place as resident Increment astronaut. His stay on the station improved operations in several areas, including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle, &quot;hand-over&quot; procedures for long-duration American crew members and &quot;Ham&quot; amateur radio communications.

Two spacewalks were carried out during his time aboard. Their aim was to remove electrical power connectors from a 12-year-old solar power array on the base block and reconnect the cables to the more efficient new solar power arrays. In all, Blaha spent four months with the Mir-22 cosmonaut crew conducting material science, fluid science, and life science research, before returning to Earth the next year aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-81.

===Fire and collision (1997)===
In 1997 STS-81 replaced Increment astronaut John Blaha with Jerry Linenger, after Blaha&#x27;s 118-day stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot;. During this fifth shuttle docking, the crew of &quot;Atlantis&quot; moved supplies to the station and returned to Earth the first plants to complete a life cycle in space; a crop of wheat planted by Shannon Lucid. During five days of mated operations, the crews transferred nearly of logistics to &quot;Mir&quot;, and transferred of materials back to &quot;Atlantis&quot; (the most materials transferred between the two spacecraft to that date).

The STS-81 crew also tested the Shuttle Treadmill Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS), designed for use in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module of the International Space Station. The shuttle&#x27;s small vernier jet thrusters were fired during the mated operations to gather engineering data for &quot;reboosting&quot; the ISS. After undocking, &quot;Atlantis&quot; performed a fly-around of &quot;Mir&quot;, leaving Linenger aboard the station.
During his Increment, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built Orlan-M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev. All three crewmembers of expedition EO-23 performed a &quot;fly-around&quot; in the Soyuz spacecraft, first undocking from one docking port of the station, then manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location. This made Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (Space Shuttle and Soyuz).

Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission. These included the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a backup oxygen-generating device), failures of various on board systems, a near collision with a Progress resupply cargo ship during a long-distance manual docking system test and a total loss of station electrical power. The power failure also caused a loss of attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled &quot;tumble&quot; through space.

The next NASA astronaut to stay on &quot;Mir&quot; was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian mission specialist Elena Kondakova boarded &quot;Mir&quot; from &quot;Atlantis&quot; on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to &quot;Mir&quot; was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA&#x27;s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.

Foale&#x27;s Increment proceeded fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship collided with solar arrays on the &quot;Spektr&quot; module during the second test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU. The module&#x27;s outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit depressurization in the history of spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed &quot;Spektr&quot; hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station&#x27;s air pressure, whilst the pressure in &quot;Spektr&quot;, containing many of Foale&#x27;s experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.

In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of &quot;Spektr&quot; and to attempt to locate the leak, &quot;Mir&quot; new commander Anatoly Solovyev and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov carried out a salvage operation later in the mission. They entered the empty module during a so-called &quot;IVA&quot; spacewalk, inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from &quot;Spektr&quot; systems to the rest of the station. Following these first investigations, Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6-hour EVA on the surface of &quot;Spektr&quot; to inspect the damaged module.

After these incidents, the US Congress and NASA considered whether to abandon the program out of concern for astronauts&#x27; safety but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue the program. The next flight to &quot;Mir&quot;, STS-86, brought Increment astronaut David Wolf to the station.

STS-86 performed the seventh Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; docking, the last of 1997. During &quot;Atlantis&quot; stay crew members Titov and Parazynski conducted the first joint US–Russian extravehicular activity during a Shuttle mission, and the first in which a Russian wore a US spacesuit. During the five-hour spacewalk, the pair affixed a Solar Array Cap to the Docking Module, for a future attempt by crew members to seal off the leak in &quot;Spektr&quot; hull. The mission returned Foale to Earth, along with samples, hardware, and an old Elektron oxygen generator, and dropped Wolf off on the Station ready for his 128-day Increment. Wolf had originally been scheduled to be the final &quot;Mir&quot; astronaut, but was chosen to go on the Increment instead of astronaut Wendy Lawrence. Lawrence was deemed ineligible for flight because of a change in Russian requirements after the Progress supply vehicle collision. The new rules required that all &quot;Mir&quot; crew members should be trained and ready for spacewalks, but a Russian spacesuit could not be prepared for Lawrence in time for launch.

===Phase One closes down (1998)===
The final year of Phase One began with the flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on STS-89. The mission delivered cosmonaut Salizhan Sharipov to &quot;Mir&quot; and replaced David Wolf with Andy Thomas, following Wolf&#x27;s 119-day Increment.

During his Increment, the last of the program, Thomas worked on 27 science investigations into areas of advanced technology, Earth sciences, human life sciences, microgravity research, and ISS risk mitigation. His stay on &quot;Mir&quot;, considered the smoothest of the entire Phase One program, featured weekly &quot;Letters from the Outpost&quot; from Thomas and passed two milestones for length of spaceflight—815 consecutive days in space by American astronauts since the launch of Shannon Lucid on the STS-76 mission in March 1996, and 907 days of &quot;Mir&quot; occupancy by American astronauts dating back to Norman Thagard&#x27;s trip to &quot;Mir&quot; in March 1995.

Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; mission, STS-91. The mission closed out Phase One, with the EO-25 and STS-91 crews transferring water to &quot;Mir&quot; and exchanging almost of cargo experiments and supplies between the two spacecraft. Long-term American experiments that had been on board &quot;Mir&quot; were also moved into &quot;Discovery&quot;. Hatches were closed for undocking at 9:07 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on June 8 and the spacecraft separated at 12:01 p.m. EDT that day.

===Phases Two and Three: ISS (1998–present)===

With the landing of &quot;Discovery&quot; on June 12, 1998, the Phase One program concluded. Techniques and equipment developed during the program assisted the development of Phase Two: initial assembly of the International Space Station (ISS). The arrival of the &quot;Destiny&quot; Laboratory Module in 2001 marked the end of Phase Two and the start of Phase Three, the final outfitting of the station, completed in 2012. 

In 2015, a reconfiguration of the American segment was completed to allow its docking ports to accommodate NASA-sponsored commercial crew vehicles, that were expected to start visiting the ISS in 2018.

, the ISS has a pressurized volume of , and its pressurized modules total in length, plus a large truss structure that spans , making it the largest spacecraft ever assembled. The completed station consists of five laboratories and is able to support six crew members. With over of habitable volume and a mass of the completed station is almost twice the size of the combined Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; spacecraft.

Phases Two and Three are intended to continue both international cooperation in space and zero-gravity scientific research, particularly regarding long-duration spaceflight. By spring 2015, Roscosmos, NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) have agreed to extend the ISS&#x27;s mission from 2020 to 2024. 

In 2018 that was then extended out to 2030. The results of this research will provide considerable information for long-duration expeditions to the Moon and flights to Mars.

Following the intentional deorbiting of &quot;Mir&quot; on 23 March 2001, the ISS became the only space station in orbit around Earth. It retained that distinction until the launch of Chinese Tiangong-1 space laboratory on 29 September 2011. 

&quot;Mir&quot; legacy lives on in the station, bringing together five space agencies in the cause of exploration and allowing those space agencies to prepare for their next leap into space, to the Moon, Mars and beyond.

==Controversy==
===Safety and scientific return===
Criticism of the program was primarily concerned with the safety of the aging &quot;Mir&quot;, particularly following the fire aboard the station and collision with the Progress supply vessel in 1997.

The fire, caused by the malfunction of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, but some of the respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted on the walls of the modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier &quot;Mir&quot; expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.

The near-miss and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both were caused by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual docking system, which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive &quot;Kurs&quot; automatic docking system from the Progress ships.

In the wake of the collision NASA and the Russian Space Agency instigated numerous safety councils who were to determine the cause of the accident. As their investigations progressed, the two space agencies results began moving in different directions. NASA&#x27;s results blamed the TORU docking system, as it required the astronaut or cosmonaut in charge to dock the Progress without the aide of any sort of telemetry or guidance. However, the Russian Space Agency&#x27;s results blamed the accident on crew error, accusing their own cosmonaut of miscalculating the distance between the Progress and the space station. The Russian Space Agency&#x27;s results were heavily criticized, even by their own cosmonaut Tsibliyev, on whom they were placing the blame. During his first press conference following his return to Earth, the cosmonaut expressed his anger and disapproval by declaring, &quot;It has been a long tradition here in Russia to look for scapegoats.&quot;

The accidents also added to the increasingly vocal criticism of the aging station&#x27;s reliability. Astronaut Blaine Hammond claimed that his safety concerns about &quot;Mir&quot; were ignored by NASA officials, and that records of safety meetings &quot;disappeared from a locked vault&quot;. &quot;Mir&quot; was originally designed to fly for five years but eventually flew for three times that length of time. During Phase One and afterward, the station was showing her age—constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes were an ever-present concern for crews. Various breakdowns of &quot;Mir&quot; Elektron oxygen-generating system were also a concern. These breakdowns led crews to become increasingly reliant on the SFOG systems that caused the fire in 1997. SFOG systems continue to be a problem aboard the ISS.

Another issue of controversy was the scale of its actual scientific return, particularly following the loss of the &quot;Spektr&quot; science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering the fact that most of the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.

===Attitudes===
Attitudes of the Russian space program and NASA towards Phase One were also of concern to the astronauts involved. Because of Russia&#x27;s financial issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of &quot;Mir&quot; was more important than the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard &quot;Skylab&quot; and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.

Following the two accidents in 1997, astronaut Jerry Linenger felt that the Russian authorities attempted a cover-up to downplay the significance of the incidents, fearing that the Americans would back out of the partnership. A large part of this &quot;cover-up&quot; was the seeming impression that the American astronauts were not in fact &quot;partners&quot; aboard the station, but were instead &quot;guests&quot;. NASA staff did not find out for several hours about the fire and collision and found themselves kept out of decision-making processes. NASA became more involved when Russian mission controllers intended to place blame for the accident entirely on Vasily Tsibliyev. It was only after the application of significant pressure from NASA that this stance was changed.

At various times during the program, NASA managers and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and had a hard time getting anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.

===Finances===
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union a few years earlier, the Russian economy had been slowly collapsing and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia&#x27;s space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard &quot;Mir&quot;. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of &quot;Mir&quot; being sold for around $500 million.

Critics argued that the $325 million contract NASA had with Russia was the only thing keeping the Russian space program alive, and only the Space Shuttle was keeping &quot;Mir&quot; aloft. NASA also had to pay hefty fees for training manuals and equipment used by astronauts training at Star City. Problems came to a head when ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; revealed that there was a distinct possibility of embezzlement of American finances by the Russian authorities in order to build a suite of new cosmonaut houses in Moscow, or else that the building projects were being funded by the Russian Mafia. NASA administrator Goldin was invited onto &quot;Nightline&quot; to defend the homes but he refused to comment. NASA&#x27;s office for external affairs was quoted as saying, &quot;What Russia does with its own money is their business.&quot;

<doc id="976593" wikidata="Q6774769" url="?curid=976593" title="Martika (album)">
<text>Martika is the debut studio album by singer-songwriter Martika, released on October 18, 1988, through CBS Records. Following her appearance in the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; between 1984 and 1986, she signed her first recording contract with CBS, and released her debut single &quot;More Than You Know&quot; in November 1988, one month following the release of the album. The follow up single, &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; achieved international commercial success, reaching number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks in mid–1989. Further singles from the album &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; and &quot;Water&quot; achieved some commercial success in the United Kingdom and Australia. 

The album was certified Gold in the United States, and Platinum in both the United Kingdom and Canada, whilst in Australia it was awarded a double platinum certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Worldwide, &quot;Martika&quot; is estimated to have sold over three million copies since its release. 

==Background==
The album marked the solo debut for Martika, and spawned the American No. 1 single &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;. The song is about drug addiction, but can sound like a break-up ballad. The song was later sampled by rapper Eminem for his 2004 song &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; featuring Martika as the chorus singer. Songs that charted internationally included &quot;More Than You Know&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, and &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot;, a Carole King cover that cracked the American Top 25. Stylistically the music was strictly pop, despite exploring some adult topics lyrically. &quot;Water&quot; is partially sung in Spanish, a homage to Martika&#x27;s Cuban ancestry. Other songs were re-recorded fully in Spanish for international release.

Although this was the album Martika attempted to break away from her &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; image, she did have four of her former castmates sing the &quot;children&#x27;s chorus&quot; of &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;.

The album was successful in the U.S.; it peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Gold by the RIAA, making it her best-selling album to date. The album peaked at No. 11 in the United Kingdom, containing three top 20 singles there. In the UK, the song &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; had already been a top 20 hit for the band Eighth Wonder a year previously, whilst Big Fun pulled their planned single release of &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; shortly before Martika&#x27;s release.

<text>A step outline (also informally called a beat sheet or scene-by-scene) is a detailed telling of a story with the intention of turning the story into a screenplay for a motion picture. 

The step outline briefly details every scene of the screenplay&#x27;s story, and often has indications for dialogue and character interactions. The scenes are often numbered in the order in which they occur for convenience.

It can also be an extremely useful tool for a writer working on a spec script.

<text>Life Goes On is an American drama television series that aired on ABC from September 12, 1989, to May 23, 1993. The show centers on the Thatcher family living in suburban Chicago: Drew, his wife Libby, and their children Paige, Rebecca and Charles, who is known as Corky. &quot;Life Goes On&quot; was the first television series to feature a major character with Down syndrome.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===

Drew is the husband of Libby Thatcher and the father of Paige, Corky, and Becca Thatcher. He is a Special Olympics coach who formerly worked for a construction company before going into the restaurant business.
* Patti LuPone as Elizabeth &quot;Libby&quot; Thatcher:
Drew&#x27;s wife, Paige&#x27;s stepmother, and Corky and Becca&#x27;s mother, who has been a singer and actress.

At the end of Season 2, she gives birth to her and Drew&#x27;s fourth child, a son named Nicholas.
*Monique Lanier (season 1); Tracey Needham (seasons 2-4), as Paige Thatcher: 
Drew&#x27;s daughter, Libby&#x27;s stepdaughter, and Corky and Becca&#x27;s older half-sister. Paige frequently dates men of whom her father does not approve. She is very caring of Corky but has a love-hate relationship with Becca.

==Overview==
The drama featured the Thatcher family, whose son, Charles &quot;Corky&quot; Thatcher (played by Chris Burke), has Down syndrome, while their daughter Becca (played by Kellie Martin) did well at school but was socially awkward. Patti LuPone, then best known for theatrical roles, played the mother Elizabeth (&quot;Libby&quot;) and Bill Smitrovich played the father Drew. Eldest sister Paige Thatcher was played by Monique Lanier during the 1989–1990 season and by Tracey Needham during the 1990–1993 seasons as Lanier left the series to have a child. Becca&#x27;s boyfriend and Corky&#x27;s buddy, Tyler Benchfield, was played by Tommy Puett. Jerry Berkson (Ray Buktenica) was Libby&#x27;s quirky boss. In the last two seasons, Becca&#x27;s boyfriend Jesse McKenna was played by Chad Lowe.

The show is set in the Chicago suburb Glenbrook, Illinois, which is named after the high school which one of creator Michael Braverman&#x27;s children attended at the time. The name itself is a blend of the real suburbs served by the school, Glenview and Northbrook.

Each episode&#x27;s opening credits end with a shot of Arnold, the family dog (billed as &quot;Arnold the Semi-Wonder Dog&quot;). Apparently forgotten by the family in their rush to get ready for the day, he sits in the kitchen with his empty food bowl in his mouth and lets it drop to the floor. The show&#x27;s producers received a constant trickle of letters each week from viewers who thought this was cruel, so in the final episode&#x27;s opening credits, a bag of dog food spills out of a nearby cabinet.

===Early seasons===
During the show&#x27;s first year, the main focus was on Corky. Much of the show examined the challenges of a family whose son had Down Syndrome. The Thatchers sought to have Corky interact with regular society after spending years socializing him amongst other kids with Down syndrome in &quot;special&quot; classes. The need to integrate Corky into normal society was Season 1&#x27;s main storyline, as the Thatchers opted to enroll Corky in a regular high school despite the principal&#x27;s demand that he be placed in an alternative program for those with Down syndrome. 
In addition, during the first three seasons, episodes included Tyler Benchfield (Tommy Puett), Becca&#x27;s high school crush, who also had a brother with Down syndrome.

Corky eventually got a job as an usher at a local movie theater. He later found a girlfriend, Amanda Swanson (Andrea Friedman), who also had Down Syndrome. They married by the series&#x27; end.

===Later seasons===
By the second season, the writers began to expand the show&#x27;s scope beyond Corky, and the third and fourth seasons centered on Becca and a new character, Jesse (Chad Lowe), a junior who met Becca through the school&#x27;s theatre department. As they become friends, Jesse told Becca he was HIV positive. Tyler became less prominent in Becca&#x27;s life and was jealous of Becca&#x27;s closeness with Jesse. His character was written out and he was given the memorable sendoff of dying in a car accident with Corky as passenger.

Much to the surprise of those around them, Becca and Jesse began a relationship despite his HIV. The writers explored life with HIV through Jesse&#x27;s character, and the difficulties the disease causes with romantic relationships. The relationship between Corky and Becca, previously portrayed as close, was also explored, as Corky briefly turned his back on his sister for dumping a mutual friend to date Jesse.

The fourth season&#x27;s first episode, in which a 40-something Becca (Pamela Bellwood) tours the house she grew up in while remembering the events of 25 years earlier, establishes that Jesse would ultimately die from AIDS and that Becca would move on and marry a man named David. The series itself ended ambiguously but on an upbeat note, showing Becca five years later, married with a son named Jesse. In the final episode Corky was set to graduate from high school, but he did not because the school board did not waive the math requirement.

On May 9, 2006, Warner Home Video released Season 1 of &quot;Life Goes On&quot; on DVD in Region 1. It is unknown if the remaining three seasons will be released. The DVD release has a replacement theme song at the beginning of each episode, with the exception of the show&#x27;s pilot. The replacement was due to high licensing costs for the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.&quot; The new song aptly titled &quot;Life Goes On&quot; was written by composer Marc Jackson of MoonLab Music and sung by singer/songwriter Tara Johnston. The song was written specifically for the DVD release.

<text>Julius Blum GmbH (commonly referred to as Blum) is an international company that produces hinge-, lift- and runner-systems and the appropriate assembly tools for the cabinet making and furniture industry.

==Description==
Blum is an international manufacturer of furniture hardware. It is a family-owned company based in Höchst, a municipality in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg. Production facilities are mainly located in Austria, but the company also has production plants in the United States, in Poland and in Brazil. Blum supplies furniture manufacturers and hardware distributors in more than 120 countries worldwide. 97% of its products are exported, and its annual turnover was 1,887.85 million euros in 2018/2019.

The company had 7,983 employees, as of June 30, 2019. In Vorarlberg, the company is one of the largest employers, with eight factories with more than 6.600 employees.

==History==
The company was founded in 1952 by blacksmith Julius Blum in Höchst.

The first product was a horseshoe stud, which prevents horses from slipping. Then in 1958, the first furniture hinge was produced. The construction of concealed hinges started in 1964, and this essentially led to the entry into the furniture fittings industry. Today, Blum products are exported to more than 120 countries.

Julius Blum died in 2006, and the family business continued to be run by his sons, Gerhard Blum and Herbert Blum. Today, the company structure is as follows: Gerhard E. Blum (26%), Herbert Blum (26%), and Blum Private Trust (48%). Since 30 June 2019 the third generation has taken the helm of the family-owned company, and Gerhard E. Blum will now focus on the Blum Group Holding. 

== Production facilities and subsidiaries ==
The company has seven factories in Vorarlberg, and additional production sites are situated in Poland, Brazil and the United States. In the 2017/18 financial year, 48% of the company’s turnover was generated in the EU, 15% in the United States and 37% in other markets than Austria.The company has 31 subsidiaries worldwide.

Blum subsidiaries (ranked according to the founding year):
== Products ==
Blum is specialized in the production of fittings and systems for furniture, in particular for kitchens. The main business segments are lift, hinge and pull-out systems. Blum products are displayed at showrooms, home design shows and fairs for the furniture industry, such as Interzum in Cologne and Kitchen &amp; Bath Industry Show (KBIS).

== Research ==
Blum invests 4% of its annual revenue in research and development. In 2014, the company held around 67 patents and 2.100 trademark rights in total. Blum Austria occupies second place in the invention rankings and ranks amongst Austria’s top ten patent candidates.

The company has set up training rooms, laboratory kitchens and test-drive areas to identify requirements of kitchen fitters, manufacturers, sellers and kitchen buyers. Research insights have resulted in new and improved products and concepts for storage space planning in kitchens.

Blum has won several awards in product quality and design. In 2013, the furniture manufacturer received the European Inventor Award in the &quot;industry&quot; category for its hinge system Blumotion. The invention assures that doors, drawers and lift systems close gently and silently.

== Apprenticeship training ==
Blum Austria started its own apprenticeship system in 1970. The four-year program is a combination of class participation and practical training in the company. Students are able to learn high-tech professions in metal and plastics processing. Vocational training is common within central Europe, as young people are split at the age of 15 either to academic schools or to apprenticeships.

Eight training programs are currently offered:
In 1995, Blum USA introduced the in-house training program &quot;Apprenticeship 2000&quot; according to the Austrian model. The company cooperates with businesses in the community and the Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC).

As of September 2019, the company had trained 363 apprentices, 21 of which were in the United States. Blum apprentices frequently take part in global competitions like WorldSkills, in which they have received several certificates of excellence.

Blum is actively involved in a variety of initiatives with educational and training organisations, such as the Buckinghamshire New University Foundation Course for kitchen designers.

== Environment ==
Blum started to install energy management systems as early as 20 years ago. The company has been certified to several international standards, including ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 50001.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-26 is a single-seater aerobatic aircraft from the former Soviet Union, powered by a single radial reciprocating engine. The Su-26 has mid-mounted straight wings and fixed landing gear, the main gear mounted on a solid titanium arc.

The Su-26 made its first flight in June 1984, the original four having a two-bladed propeller. The production switched to the Su-26M, with refined tail surfaces and a German-made MTV-9 3-blade composite propeller. Further refinements were made, and the model won both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team prizes at the 1986 World Aerobatics Championships. The modified Su-26M3 with the new M9F engine dominated the 2003 and 2005 Aerobatic World Championships as well as the 2004 European Championships.

The Su-26 has fully metric instruments, except for the altimeter.

==In popular culture==
&quot;IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover&quot; is a combat flight simulation video game mainly set in the Battle of Britain in 1940. Nevertheless, when the game was still under development, the Sukhoi Su-26 had been promised as a bonus flyable aircraft for all players, but was not included in the game upon release in March 2011. It was finally included as downloadable content with the adjunction of the Steam patch 1.11.20362 on 19 October 2012.

==Biography==
Osgood was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest child of a family of watchmakers. The family moved to California in 1888 and he went to study in Santa Clara and San Jose. He joined in the activities of the Cooper Ornithological Club and found company in and Rollo H. Beck. He taught at a school in Arizona for a year and then moved to the newly formed Stanford University, where he came to meet Charles H. Gilbert and David Starr Jordan. He joined the staff of the Bureau of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy, of the United States Department of Agriculture at the age of 22. This group later became the Bureau of Biological Survey under Clinton Hart Merriam.

In 1909 he moved to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he was assistant curator of mammalogy and ornithology from 1909 to 1921, and curator of zoology from 1921 to 1940. He collected in North America and Chile. He traveled with Louis Agassiz Fuertes to Ethiopia as part of the 1926-27 Field Museum-Chicago Daily News Abyssinian Expedition. He wrote &quot;The Mammals of Chile&quot; (1943) and co-wrote &quot;Artist and Naturalist in Ethiopia&quot; (1936). He died a bachelor on 20 June 1947.

While working at the Field Museum, he was elected a member of the London Zoological Society (along with Teddy Roosevelt) in 1910.

<text>Martika&#x27;s Kitchen is the second and final studio album by singer-songwriter Martika, released in 1991 on Columbia Records. The album was reissued in deluxe two-CD edition in 2018 as &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen (Reheated Edition)&quot; with 12 bonus tracks of rare mixes and single edits.

==Album background==
The album was a departure in musical styles from Martika&#x27;s debut album. &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; incorporates elements of gospel, jazz, funk, R&amp;B and traditional Cuban music. The album features four songs written and produced by Prince. The four Prince songs (tracks 1–3 and 10) on the album were recorded by him and then sent to Martika to overdub. Three of those songs were based on a lyrics notebook she had given him for inspiration.

==Album reception==
The Prince-penned title track cracked the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the gospel-themed &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot;, co-written by Prince and Martika, made the top 10.

The album was certified gold in both the UK and Australia. &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot; reached #1 in Australia, and the top 10 in the UK, Ireland, and New Zealand. The &quot;Martika&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; single reached the top 40 in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. A third single, &quot;Coloured Kisses&quot;, narrowly missed the top 40 in the UK, and peaked at #39 in Australia. A fourth single, &quot;Safe In the Arms of Love&quot;, was released in Europe in 1992 but failed to chart. &quot;Temptation&quot; was set to become the final single but was never officially released.

A concert tour to promote the album visited over 200 cities.

<text>John Fire Lame Deer (in Lakota Tȟáȟča Hušté; March 17, 1903 – December 14, 1976, also known as Lame Deer, John Fire and John (Fire) Lame Deer) was a Lakota holy man, member of the Heyoka society, grandson of the Miniconjou head man Lame Deer, and father of Archie Fire Lame Deer.

John Fire Lame Deer was a Mineconju-Lakota Sioux born on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. His father was Silas Fire Let-Them-Have-Enough. His mother was Sally Red Blanket. He lived with his grandparents until he was 6 or 7, after which he was placed in a day school near the family until age fourteen. He was then sent to a boarding school, one of many run by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs for Indian youth. These schools were designed to assimilate Native Americans into the dominant culture after their forced settlement on reservations. Lame Deer&#x27;s mother died of tuberculosis in 1920. His father moved north to Standing Rock Indian Reservation soon after and left Lame Deer with land and livestock, which Lame Deer quickly sold.

Lame Deer&#x27;s life as a young man was rough and wild; he traveled the rodeo circuit as a rider and later as a rodeo clown. He was a member of the peyote church and tribal policeman as well. According to his personal account, he drank, gambled, womanized, and once went on a several-day-long car theft and drinking binge.

Making his home at the Pine Ridge Reservation and traveling around the country, Lame Deer became known both among the Lakota and to the American public at a time when Indigenous culture and spirituality were going through a period of rebirth and the psychedelic movement of the 1960s had yet to disintegrate. He often participated in American Indian Movement events, including sit-ins at the Black Hills. The Black Hills is land that was legally owned by the Lakota until it was illegally seized by the United States government without compensation after the discovery of gold in the area. The Black Hills are sacred to the Lakota and a number of other Plains tribes. The U.S. Supreme Court found that the federal government &quot;decided to abandon the Nation&#x27;s treaty obligation to preserve the integrity of the Sioux territory&quot; and used military force to seize the Black Hills. The Lakota continue to campaign for the return of the Black Hills.

==&quot;Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions&quot;==
In 1972, Richard Erdoes published &quot;Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions&quot;; his recorded interviews with Lame Deer are part of the Richard Erdoes Papers at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.

The book is about Lame Deer&#x27;s later life, when he decided that he wanted to be a teacher and a healer. Erdoes writes of Lame Deer&#x27;s opinions of Elk, Bear, Buffalo, Coyote, and Badger medicine, and the importance Lakota ceremonial traditions played in his later life and eventual understanding of the world.

<doc id="976640" wikidata="Q1091138" url="?curid=976640" title="Orbital state vectors">
<text>In astrodynamics and celestial dynamics, the orbital state vectors (sometimes state vectors) of an orbit are
Cartesian vectors of position (formula_1) and velocity (formula_2) that together with their time (epoch) (formula_3) uniquely determine the trajectory of the orbiting body in space.

Orbital state vectors come in many forms including the traditional Position-Velocity vectors, Two-line element set (TLE), and Vector Covariance Matrix (VCM).

==Frame of reference==
State vectors are defined with respect to some frame of reference, usually but not always an inertial reference frame. One of the more popular reference frames for the state vectors of bodies moving near Earth is the Earth-centered inertial (ECI) system defined as follows:
*The origin is Earth&#x27;s center of mass;
*The Z axis is coincident with Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, positive northward;
*The X/Y plane coincides with Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane, with the +X axis pointing toward the vernal equinox and the Y axis completing a right-handed set.

The ECI reference frame is not truly inertial because of the slow, 26,000 year precession of Earth&#x27;s axis, so the reference frames defined by Earth&#x27;s orientation at a standard astronomical epoch such as B1950 or J2000 are also commonly used.

Many other reference frames can be used to meet various application requirements, including those centered on the Sun or on other planets or moons, the one defined by the barycenter and total angular momentum of the solar system (in particular the ICRF), or even a spacecraft&#x27;s own orbital plane and angular momentum.

==Position and velocity vectors==

The &quot;position vector&quot; formula_1 describes the position of the body in the chosen frame of reference, while the &quot;velocity vector&quot; formula_2 describes its velocity in the same frame at the same time. Together, these two vectors and the time at which they are valid uniquely describe the body&#x27;s trajectory as detailed in Orbit determination. The principal reasoning is that Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation yields an acceleration formula_6; if the product formula_7 of gravitational constant and attractive mass at the center of the orbit are known, position and velocity are the initial values for that second order differential equation for formula_8 which has a unique solution.

The body does not actually have to be in orbit for its state vectors to determine its trajectory; it only has to move ballistically, i.e., solely under the effects of its own inertia and gravity. For example, it could be a spacecraft or missile in a suborbital trajectory. If other forces such as drag or thrust are significant, they must be added vectorially to those of gravity when performing the integration to determine future position and velocity.

For any object moving through space, the velocity vector is tangent to the trajectory. If formula_9 is the unit vector tangent to the trajectory, then
formula_10

===Derivation===
The velocity vector formula_11 can be derived from position vector formula_1 by differentiation with respect to time:
formula_13

An object&#x27;s state vector can be used to compute its classical or Keplerian orbital elements and vice versa. Each representation has its advantages. The elements are more descriptive of the size, shape and orientation of an orbit, and may be used to quickly and easily estimate the object&#x27;s state at any arbitrary time provided its motion is accurately modeled by the two-body problem with only small perturbations.

On the other hand, the state vector is more directly useful in a numerical integration that accounts for significant, arbitrary, time-varying forces such as drag, thrust and gravitational perturbations from third bodies as well as the gravity of the primary body.

The state vectors (formula_1 and formula_2) can be easily used to compute the specific angular momentum vector as
:formula_16.

Because even satellites in low Earth orbit experience significant perturbations from non-spherical Earth&#x27;s figure, solar radiation pressure, lunar tide, and atmospheric drag, the Keplerian elements computed from the state vector at any moment are only valid for a short period of time and need to be recomputed often to determine a valid object state. Such element sets are known as &quot;osculating elements&quot; because they coincide with the actual orbit only at that moment.

<text>ALT Linux is a set of Russian operating systems based on RPM Package Manager (RPM) and built on a Linux kernel and Sisyphus package repository. ALT Linux has been developed collectively by ALT Linux Team developers community and ALT Linux Ltd.

== History ==
ALT Linux Team arose from the merger of IPLabs Linux Team and the Linux community of the Institute of Logic, Cognitive Science and Development of Personality. The latter cooperated with Mandrake Linux and SUSE Linux teams to improve localization (specifically Cyrillic script), producing a Linux-Mandrake Russian Edition (RE).

Mandrake and Mandrake RE became different distributions and thus the decision was made to create a separate project. The name &quot;ALT&quot; was coined, which is a recursive acronym meaning &quot;ALT Linux Team&quot;.

The split led to the creation of the Sisyphus package repository, which is an unstable branch of the ALT Linux development. In 2007, the Sisyphus repository won a prestigious CNews award in nomination for Information Security.

== Releases ==

=== Version history ===


=== Linux-Mandrake ===
&quot;Linux-Mandrake 7.0 Russian Edition&quot;, released in the beginning of 2000, was the first de facto independent distribution of IPLabs Linux Team. It kept the name &quot;Mandrake&quot; with permission from Mandrake developers.

&quot;Spring 2001&quot; was the second IPLabs Linux team release, released several months later.

=== ALT Linux 1.0 ===
Since the summer of 2001, ALT Linux Team has been formed and the ALT Linux name has been established.

The first ALT Linux release was &quot;ALT Linux Junior 1.0&quot;, released in summer of 2001, followed by the updated &quot;ALT Linux Junior 1.1&quot; in autumn of 2001.

Junior distributions were 1CD releases.

=== ALT Linux 2.* ===
&quot;ALT Linux Master 2.0&quot;, released in May 2002, was the 4CD all-purpose Linux distribution targeted for software developers and system administrators.

&quot;ALT Linux Junior 2.0&quot; was released in summer of 2002, as a 1CD desktop/workstation-oriented release.

=== ALT Linux 3.0 ===
ALT Linux Compact 3.0 was released during autumn 2005, and consisted of 1CD/1DVD installable versions along with LiveCD (TravelCD 3.0). There were several subsequent OEM updates counting up to 3.0.5.

=== ALT Linux 4.0 ===
These series changed the official naming somewhat to be &quot;ALT Linux 4.0 $flavour&quot;.
* Server was released in June 2007 (1CD+1DVD per platform; i586 and x86_64);
* Office Server quickly followed (1CD; i586 and x86_64);
* Desktop Personal in August 2007 (1DVD, LiveCD, Rescue CD; i586; KDE3);
* Lite in December 2007 (installation CD, live CD and 2CD with addons; i586; Xfce4);
* Terminal in December 2007 (joint release with Media Magic Ltd, 1DVD; i586; KDE3, low client RAM requirements).

There was also a more conservative &quot;school 4.0 branch&quot; maintained for the Russian schools pilot project, and several distributions specifically tailored for schools released using that as a base.

=== ALT Linux 4.1 ===
* Desktop was released in October 2008 (1CD/1DVD; i586 and x86_64; KDE3);
* Children in December 2008 (LiveCD; i586);
* Skif in December 2008 (1CD; x86_64; HPC);
* School Server in February 2009 (1CD; i586).

=== ALT Linux 5.x ===
The 5.0 branch was canceled mainly due to stormy X.org conditions (and subsequently archived); 5.1 community branch was created along with p5 &quot;conservative&quot; branch later in 2009. Somewhat confusingly, distributions based on the p5/branch were numbered as ALT Linux 5.0:

* Ark (client+server suite, 1DVD+1CD per platform; i586 and x86_64);
* School Suite – mostly i586, also including docs, video lessons and free software for Windows (3DVD):
** Server (1DVD; i586 and x86_64);
** Terminal (1DVD; KDE3);
** Master (1DVD/flash; KDE4);
** Junior (1DVD/flash; GNOME2);
** Lite (2CD; Xfce4);
** New Lite (1CD/1DVD/flash; LXDE);
* KDesktop (1DVD; i586 and x86_64; KDE4);
* Simply Linux 5.0 (1CD/flash/LiveCD; i586; Xfce4).

=== Lite ===
A small single-CD distribution for older/low-memory computers, with Xfce as default desktop. Available in normal and Live CD versions. Rather superseded by LXDE-based New Lite.

=== Compact ===
&quot;Compact&quot; is a series of ALT Linux distributions tailored for beginner users. It is mostly used on workstations, home computers, and notebooks. It includes additional means for easy configuration, many office and multimedia applications, and some games. &quot;Compact&quot; was also a popular choice for OEM white-labeling, i.e., creating a specific edition for various hardware vendors to bundle with their hardware.


Linux
&quot;ALT Linux Server&quot; is a hardened server single CD distribution. It is certified by Federal department of technical and expert control of Russia in the following categories:
* by the level of monitoring for non-declared features – level 4
* class of protection from unauthorized access to information – class 5

=== Terminal ===
&quot;ALT Linux Terminal&quot; is a terminal server distribution based on ALT Linux Desktop and ALTSP5: a friendly/merging fork of Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) which is usable on older hardware acting as thin and diskless clients (16 MB RAM is enough, while stock LTSP5 usually requires ≥ 64 MB RAM). It was also adapted for Russian School Education National Project free software package.

<text>In operator theory, a multiplication operator is an operator defined on some vector space of functions and whose value at a function is given by multiplication by a fixed function . That is,
formula_1
for all in the domain of , and all in the domain of (which is the same as the domain of ).

Multiplication operators generalize the notion of operator given by a diagonal matrix. More precisely, one of the results of operator theory is a spectral theorem that states that every self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on an &quot;L&quot;&quot;2&quot; space.

These operators are often contrasted with composition operators, which are similarly induced by any fixed function . They are also closely related to Toeplitz operators, which are compressions of multiplication operators on the circle to the Hardy space.

== Properties ==
* A multiplication operator formula_2 on formula_3, where is formula_4-finite, is bounded if and only if is in formula_5. In this case, its operator norm is equal to formula_6.

* The adjoint of a multiplication operator formula_2 is formula_8, where formula_9 is the complex conjugate of . As a consequence, formula_2 is self-adjoint if and only if is real-valued.

* The spectrum of a bounded multiplication operator formula_2 is the essential range of ; outside of this spectrum, the inverse of formula_12 is the multiplication operator formula_13

* Two bounded multiplication operators formula_2 and formula_15 on formula_16 are equal if and are equal almost everywhere.

== Example ==
Consider the Hilbert space of complex-valued square integrable functions on the interval . With , define the operator
formula_17
for any function in . This will be a self-adjoint bounded linear operator, with domain all of and with norm . Its spectrum will be the interval (the range of the function defined on ). Indeed, for any complex number , the operator is given by
formula_18

It is invertible if and only if is not in , and then its inverse is 
formula_19
which is another multiplication operator.

This example can be easily generalized to characterizing the norm and spectrum of a multiplication operator on any &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; space.

<text>Robert Warren is an Australian bass guitarist who has played in various bands since 1985 in both Brisbane and Sydney, including Died Pretty (1991–2002).

==Biography==
Robert Warren played bass guitar in various Australian bands in both Brisbane and Sydney from 1985 to the present, including chronologically, The Closest Thing, Dementia 13, The Egyptians, Sanity Assassins, The Reptile House, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Died Pretty (1991–2002), Lodestar, Hissy Fit, Mr Blonde and Libero Vox.

Most recently, Warren has performed with The Exploding Boys who act as the backing band for tribute shows featuring various singers.

Warren&#x27;s recorded material is notable for driving, &quot;tribal-sounding&quot; bass lines, and bass lines that provided the melody line in a song by using chord variations, most often against a pedal note. The prominent use of the bass guitar to provide such melodic interest was a feature of many Died Pretty recordings and can be traced throughout the band&#x27;s history. Warren has appeared in eight Died Pretty videos and press interviews in various media outlets.

<text>Timothy Allan Burgess (born 30 May 1967) is an English musician, singer-songwriter and record label owner, best known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band the Charlatans.

==Early life==

Burgess was born in Worsley, Lancashire, but grew up in Moulton, Cheshire, where he moved when he was five. He went to Leftwich High School.

He left school at sixteen, and worked for the ICI overseas distribution department at Runcorn.

==Career==
===The Charlatans===

Burgess was initially the lead singer in The Electric Crayons (named after the psychedelic compilation album &quot;The Electric Crayon Set&quot;, released on the Bam-Caruso record label), who released one single, &quot;Hip Shake Junkie&quot;.

Burgess then joined the Charlatans, who were largely influenced by acid house, 1960s-era West Coast psychedelia and the Syd Barrett era of Pink Floyd. The Charlatans&#x27; debut single &quot;Indian Rope&quot; was successful, and the group subsequently signed to Situation Two, an offshoot of the Beggars Banquet label. In 1990 they released the single &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; on the imprint, which charted in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. The band have released thirteen studio albums to date.

Before the release of the 2004 Charlatans album &quot;Up at the Lake&quot;, Burgess was living in Los Angeles in the US, away from the other band members who were still based in England. He explained the band&#x27;s process during that period in a 2012 interview: 
&quot;I&#x27;m back in London now, but Mark and Tony enjoyed trips out to Los Angeles and we used Los Angeles as a writing tool. I loved the idea of incorporating a city into your music. We used LA quite a lot.&quot;

===Solo===

Burgess&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;I Believe&quot;, was released in Europe on 3 September 2003 and included the track &quot;Oh My Corazon&quot;.

Burgess&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Oh No I Love You&quot; was produced by Mark Nevers and recorded at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, US. In 2012, Burgess explained the origin of this album:
&quot;The root of this album goes right back to a Kurt Wagner show in Manchester. I carried Kurt&#x27;s guitar to the car for him. I took the chance to ask him if he would ever consider writing a song with me. He said, &quot;Sure Tim, you write the music and I&#x27;ll write the words.&quot; That one song turned into an album and almost ten years after we first talked about it, the album is ready.&quot;
&quot;Oh No I Love You&quot; also features collaborations with Factory Floor, R. Stevie Moore and My Morning Jacket, amongst others. The album was later nominated for the Artrocker &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; award in 2012.

===Collaborations===
Burgess contributed vocals to Saint Etienne&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;I Was Born on Christmas Day&quot;, which appeared on the &quot;Xmas 93&quot; CD single.

Burgess has twice contributed vocals to tracks by the Chemical Brothers: 1995&#x27;s &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, taken from their debut album &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot;; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Boxer&quot;, from their &quot;Push the Button&quot; album.

Burgess is a member of the Chavs, together with Carl Barât (the Libertines) and Jamie Reynolds (the Klaxons). In mid-2008, Burgess stated that the band planned to record their debut album in August of that year; however, as of July 2015, an album has yet to emerge. Burgess explained in a 2010 interview: 
&quot;I think The Chavs have definitely got this mythical thing going on. They have existed and will exist again.&quot;
Burgess remixed the Robots in Disguise song &quot;The Tears&quot;, which was released in 2008.

In 2009, Burgess curated the Big Top stage at the Isle of Wight Festival, with a line-up that included Killing Joke and the Horrors. Burgess later explained his reason for selecting The Horrors:
&quot;I really believed in them from the very first time I met them. It was at the time when their first album was released.&quot;

Burgess contributed vocals to the song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know This About Me&quot; by Freebass, the group featuring New Order ex-member Peter Hook and Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield of the Stone Roses. The song was released in 2010 as part of the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Two Worlds Collide&quot;.

During his time in Los Angeles, Burgess collaborated with Joaquin Phoenix on an album that Phoenix was recording at the time; however, in a 2012 interview, Burgess explained that he had not heard from Phoenix since his return to the UK:
&quot;I&#x27;ve not seen him for ages... I don&#x27;t live in Los Angeles anymore. The time that we spent together was a really great moment. A really great couple of months for me really. He invited me into the recording studio to work on a record and we had a really great time. All relationships with people in bands or actors I&#x27;ve met along the way, you meet them, you&#x27;re best friends for a minute and you just don&#x27;t see them at all. If you just remember them as being really great friends and in a way they are. Even if you don&#x27;t see someone, it&#x27;s kind of better, &#x27;cos you never get a chance to fall out!&quot;

On 15 November 2012, Burgess performed at Manchester Cathedral as part of a &quot;supergroup&quot; featuring Mark Collins of the Charlatans, Martin Duffy of Primal Scream, and New Order&#x27;s Peter Hook. The performance was part of a concert organised to help the city&#x27;s &quot;deprived youth.&quot;

Burgess collaborated with Asia Argento on the song &quot;Hours / Ours&quot;, which was released on Burgess&#x27;s own record label O Genesis in 2014.

Burgess collaborated with Peter Gordon to release &quot;Same Language, Different Worlds&quot; on 2 September 2017 through Burgess&#x27; own label, O Genesis. The Charlatans frontman originally met New Yorker Peter Gordon in 2012 and they decided then on a music collaboration. Burgess had been a longtime fan of Gordon&#x27;s work with Arthur Russell and The Love of Life Orchestra. The album was produced by Gordon in New York and features many of his and Tim&#x27;s previous collaborators: Ernie Brooks who played with Arthur Russell on the first Modern Lovers album, trombone player Peter Zummo, conga player Mustafa Ahmed and Nik Void from Factory Floor.

===O Genesis===
O Genesis is Burgess&#x27;s own record label, founded in 2011. A compilation CD showcasing the label&#x27;s artists was released on 10 March 2014, featuring Burgess as a solo artist alongside artists such as Minny Pops, Hatcham Social and Joseph Coward.

===Other work===
In February 2013, Burgess replaced BBC Radio 6 Music host Lauren Laverne when she and other National Union of Journalists (NUJ) members engaged in strike action against the BBC.

In 2019, Burgess made his acting debut in the short film &quot;The Bookshop&quot; as the protagonist Leonard.

In March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in most live music concerts being cancelled, Burgess started &quot;Tim&#x27;s Twitter Listening Party&quot;, where he would tweet whilst listening to an album with one or more guests, normally a member of the band, who would provide insights and anecdotes about the songs, recording the album or other associated items. Over 700 parties were held in the first year. On 31 August 2023, Burgess announced on his X (formerly Twitter) account that there would be no more additions of &quot;Tim&#x27;s Twitter Listening Party&quot; but it would continue as a radio and podcast format.

On 20 March 2023, it was announced that Burgess would present &quot;Tim&#x27;s Listening Party&quot;, a six-part radio and podcast series based on &quot;Tim&#x27;s Twitter Listening Party&quot;, which would air on Sunday nights on Absolute Radio. The first series began on 26 March 2023 followed by a second series on 23 July 2023, which will have eight episodes. A third series began airing on 29 October 2023. A fourth series began on 14 April 2024. A fifth series began on 10 November 2024.

==Personal life==
Burgess&#x27; autobiography &quot;Telling Stories&quot; was published in 2012 by Viking Press. Following the release of the book, Burgess responded to a question about whether he would have changed anything about his career:
No, because I would have had to re-write it again! Everything that happened happened because we made a decision at a point in time and at certain ages. I had a relationship with drugs for quite a long time. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s over but at the same time I don&#x27;t regret it. I must have enjoyed it because I did it for so long. It&#x27;s the same with the relationship with other people. They lasted as long as they did because they were mostly quite good.
In 2012, Burgess told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; why he practises Transcendental Meditation:
At the minimum it de-stresses you. You get thoughts — it&#x27;s not psychedelic—but things pop into your brain. John Lennon used to stop and write his ideas down; I choose not to. I&#x27;m enjoying myself so much I don&#x27;t want to stop.

In March 2014, during a BBC Radio 6 interview with Roddy Frame, it was revealed that Burgess is a fan of the music of both Frame and Edwyn Collins and that he invited the pair to play at his Tim Peaks Café at the Kendal Calling music festival in 2013. Frame stated during the interview that Burgess is &quot;so positive&quot; and both will occasionally drink tea together.

Burgess lived in the US for twelve years before returning to the UK in 2013; he currently lives in London. In the 1990s, Burgess married a woman named Michelle; they divorced in 2012. From his former partner Nik Void, Burgess has a son, Morgan (b. 2013). He is a fan of Manchester United F.C.

<text>STRABAG SE is an Austrian construction company based in Spittal an der Drau, Austria, with its headquarters in Vienna. It is the largest construction company in Austria and one of the largest construction companies in Europe. The company is active in its home markets Austria and Germany and in all countries of Central, Eastern and South-East Europe, in selected markets in Western Europe, on the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in Australia, Canada, Chile, China and India. In these markets STRABAG has subsidiaries or operates on a project-basis.

==History==
===Origins===
The business has its origins in two businesses:

*Baumeister Lerchbaumer-Isola-KG, which was founded as a craft workshop business known in 1835. The business was developed by Anton Lerchbaumer (1879–1954) and his son-in-law, Franz Isola (1901–1968). It evolved to become Baumeister Lerchbaumer-Isola-KG in 1929. In 1954 Anton Lerchbaumer senior died. Franz Isola became the sole manager of the largest private building company in Austria. In 1968 Franz Isola died and Anton Lerchbaumer junior (1913–1974) became manager of the company. The company became known as ILBAU AG in 1972.
*Strassenwalzenbetrieb was founded in 1895 and known as STRABAG from 1930.

===Holocaust profiteering===

Strabag was one of the main profiteers of the Nazi building projects during Second World War and before. It was a main contractor of Todt organisation and built concentration camps, the Westwall and Norway&#x27;s Blood Road. The British Secret Service report concluded &quot;[. . .] Enough large building firms offered their services to put the entire construction [of the Westwall, S.G.] on a voluntary basis. [. . .] Nor is there any basis later for assuming that firms in any large numbers became so reluctant to work for the OT as to make mass conscriptions of such concerns necessary. This willingness is due to the attractive profits obtainable from OT contracts.&quot;

===Later history===
These two businesses came under the common ownership of BIBAG Bauindustrie Beteiligungs Aktiengesellschaft (subsequently renamed STRABAG SE) – a company listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange – in 1998. In 1999, STRABAG acquired Strubag. In the same year, the company was delisted from the Vienna Stock exchange.

In 2000, the holding company Bauholding STRABAG (or STRABAG SE since 2006) started a strong brand strategy throughout Europe, unifying all under the core brand &quot;STRABAG&quot;. In Austria ILBAU and STUAG merged into the new STRABAG AG. The following year, the holding company became the major shareholder in German company STRABAG AG (based in Cologne).

Subsequent acquisitions included Deutsche Asphalt GmbH in 2002, Walter Bau Group in 2005, a majority stake in Ed. Züblin in 2005, Adanti SpA, KIRCHNER Holding GmbH, F. Kirchhoff AG and Deutsche Telekom Immobilien und Service GmbH in 2008.

In 2007, STRABAG SE launched its initial public offering on the Vienna Stock exchange.

In December 2013 the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic confirmed that one of the companies of the STRABAG Group participated in bid rigging cartel of construction companies (together with companies of Skanska group and Mota-Engil group) in 2004. Illegal conduct was associated with the tender for the execution of works for the construction of the D1 highway from Mengusovce to Jánovce in Eastern Slovakia.

In May 2022, Thomas Bull, a director appointed by the third largest shareholder, Rasperia Trading, which is owned by Russian entrepreneur Oleg Deripaska, was removed from the board to ensure compliance with the EU sanctions against Deripaska.

In October 2024, Strabag sold its 6% shareholding in GySEV to the Government of Hungary.

==Structure==
The company is organised into the following divisions: Building Construction &amp; Civil Engineering, Transportation Infrastructure, Special Divisions &amp; Concessions.

==Major projects==

Major projects have included the Alte Weser Lighthouse in the North Sea completed in 1964, Basra International Airport in Iraq completed in 1988, the Copenhagen Metro in Denmark completed in 2002, the Manapouri Second Tailrace Tunnel in New Zealand completed in 2002, the Sofia Airport Second Terminal in Bulgaria completed in 2006, the Vrmac Tunnel in Montenegro completed in 2007, the Limerick Tunnel in Ireland completed in 2010 and the Niagara Third Hydro Tunnel in Canada completed in 2013.

From 2012 to 2015, STRABAG worked on the rehabilitation and extension of the Bus Rapid Transit Infrastructure in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
STRABAG is also involved in HS2 lots S1 and S2, working as part of a joint venture, due to complete in 2031.

==Shareholders==
The largest shareholders as at September 2023 were: UNIQA Raiffeisen Group with a 29.5% stake, Hans Peter Haselsteiner&#x27;s family with a 28.3% stake and Oleg Deripaska&#x27;s Cyprus-based Rasperia Trading with a 27.8% stake. In September 2022 the company launched a buyback program.

<text>The Australian Constitution (Public Record Copy) Act 1990 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, passed in 1990. The purpose of the Act was to allow the Commonwealth of Australia to retain the original copy of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp), which the British government had loaned for the celebration in 1988 of the bicentenary of British settlement in Australia.

The Australian government had made a formal request to Queen Elizabeth II for the Act to remain in Australia, as part of the nation&#x27;s history. However, under the UK&#x27;s Public Records Act 1958, the original copy of every Act of Parliament had to remain in the Public Record Office in London. Thus the British Parliament passed a new Act to exempt this copy from that requirement, so as to allow the copy to remain with Australia as a gift.

The copy is now displayed in the Federation Gallery at the National Archives of Australia, in Canberra.

<doc id="976662" wikidata="Q3849896" url="?curid=976662" title="Marshall Field's">
<text>Marshall Field &amp; Company (commonly known as Marshall Field&#x27;s) was an upscale department store in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in the 19th century, it grew to become a large chain before Macy&#x27;s, Inc, acquired it in 2005. Its founder, Marshall Field, was a pioneering retail magnate. 

The company&#x27;s flagship Marshall Field and Company Building on State Street in the Chicago Loop is a National Landmark for its importance in the history of retail. It was officially branded &quot;Macy&#x27;s on State Street&quot; in 2006, when it became one of Macy&#x27;s flagship stores.

==History==

===Early years===

Marshall Field &amp; Company traces its antecedents to a dry goods store opened at 137 Lake Street in Chicago, Illinois, in 1852 by Potter Palmer, eponymously named P. Palmer &amp; Company. In 1856, 21-year-old Marshall Field moved to the booming midwestern city of Chicago on the southwest shores of Lake Michigan from Pittsfield, Massachusetts and found work at the city&#x27;s then-largest dry goods firm – Cooley, Wadsworth &amp; Company. Just prior to the American Civil War, in 1860, Field and bookkeeper Levi Z. Leiter became junior partners in the firm, then known as Cooley, Farwell &amp; Company. In 1864, the firm, then led by senior partner John V. Farwell, Sr., was renamed Farwell, Field &amp; Company. only for Field and Leiter to soon withdraw from the partnership with Farwell when presented with the opportunity of a lifetime.

Potter Palmer, plagued by ailing health, was looking to dispose of his thriving business, so on January 4, 1865, Field and Leiter entered into partnership with him and his brother Milton Palmer. So the firm of P. Palmer &amp; Company became Field, Palmer, Leiter &amp; Company, with Palmer financing much of their initial capital as well as his own contribution. After Field and Leiter&#x27;s immediate success enabled them to pay him back, Palmer withdrew two years later from the partnership in 1867 to focus on his own growing real-estate interests on one of the burgeoning city&#x27;s important thoroughfares, State Street. His brother, Milton Palmer, left at this time as well. The store was renamed Field, Leiter &amp; Company, sometimes referred to as &quot;Field &amp; Leiter&quot;.

The buyout, however, did not bring an end to Potter Palmer&#x27;s association with the firm. In 1868, Palmer convinced Field and Leiter to lease a new, six-story edifice he had just built at the northeast corner of State and Washington Streets. The store was soon referred to as the &quot;Marble Palace&quot; owing to its costly marble stone face.

===The Great Chicago Fire===
When the Great Chicago Fire broke out on October 8, 1871, news of this, one of the worst conflagrations to ever strike an American city, reached company officials Henry Willing and Levi Leiter, who decided to load as much of their expensive merchandise as possible onto wagons and take it to Leiter&#x27;s home, which was out of the path of the fire. The Company&#x27;s drivers and teams were ordered out of the barns. Horace B. Parker, a young salesman, rushed to the store&#x27;s basement, broke up boxes, and built a fire in the furnace boiler so that the steam-powered elevators could be operated. These employees worked feverishly through the night to remove vital records and valuable goods to safety.

At one point, the gas tank exploded, which put out the store&#x27;s gaslights. The men worked on by candlelight and the glow from the approaching flames. The employees got enough steam up to operate the store&#x27;s powerful pumps in the basement, and volunteers went to the roof and used the store&#x27;s fire hoses to wet down the roof and the wall on the side of the oncoming fire. Early in the following morning however, the city&#x27;s waterworks burned, thus ending the water supply and making further efforts useless. The last employee had scarcely exited the building when it burst into flames, shooting fire from every window.

The store burned to the ground. However, as a result of the employees&#x27; herculean efforts, so much merchandise was saved that the store was able to reopen in only a few weeks (the Wholesale Department on October 28, and the Retail Department on November 6) in a temporary location (a horse-streetcar barn of the Chicago City Railway Co. at State &amp; 20th Streets). Six months later, in April 1872, Field &amp; Leiter reopened in an unburned building at Madison and Market Streets (today&#x27;s West Wacker Drive). Salesman Parker stayed on with the Company for 45 more years, rising to the level of General Sales Manager.

===After the Great Fire===
Two years later, in October 1873, Field and Leiter returned to State Street at Washington, opening in a new five-story store at their old location they now leased from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, Palmer having sold the land site to finance his own rebuilding activities. This store was expanded in 1876, only to be destroyed by fire again in November 1877. Ever tenacious, Field and Leiter had a new temporary store opened by the end of the month at a lakefront exposition hall they leased temporarily from the city, located at what is now the site of the present Art Institute of Chicago. Meanwhile, the Singer company had speculatively built a new, even larger, six-story building on the ruins of their old 1873 store, which, after some contention, was personally bought by Field and Leiter. Field, Leiter &amp; Company now reclaimed their traditional location at the northeast corner of State and Washington for the last time in April 1879.

In January 1881, Field, with the support of his junior partners, bought out Levi Z. Leiter, renaming the business &quot;Marshall Field &amp; Company&quot;. As Palmer had before, Leiter retired to tend his significant real estate investments, which included commissioning a department store, Second Leiter Building in 1891 at State Street and Van Buren to house Siegel, Cooper &amp; Company. In 1932, this building (known as one of the earliest steel-framed commercial buildings built and still standing in the U.S. along with the Equitable Building in Baltimore) was leased to the later famous nationwide mail-order firm Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.

In 1887, the landmark seven-story Henry Hobson Richardson-designed, (1838–1886), Romanesque-styled, Marshall Field&#x27;s Wholesale Store opened on Franklin Street between Quincy and Adams (razed c.1930). Though little remembered today, the wholesale division sold merchandise in bulk to smaller merchants throughout the central and western United States and at that time did six times the sales volume of the local retail store. Chicago&#x27;s location at the nexus of the country&#x27;s railroads and Great Lakes shipping made it the center of the dry goods wholesaling business by the 1870s, with Field&#x27;s former partner from before the war, John V. Farwell, Sr., (1825–1908), being his largest rival. It was the scale of the profits generated by the John G. Shedd-led wholesale division during this time that made Marshall Field the richest man in Chicago and one of the richest in the country.

===State Street store===
Following the departure of Leiter, the retail store grew in importance. Though it remained a fraction of the size of the wholesale division, its opulent building and luxurious merchandise differentiated Marshall Field from the other wholesale dry goods merchants in town. In 1887, Harry Gordon Selfridge was appointed to lead the retail store and headed it as it evolved into a modern department store. That same year, Field personally obtained Leiter&#x27;s remaining interest in the 1879 Singer building and in 1888 started buying the buildings adjoining his for additional floor space.
Marshall Field also had a child at this time.

In 1892, the structures between the 1879 building on State Street and Wabash Avenue to the east were demolished and the famous influential architect Daniel H. Burnham and his firm D.H. Burnham &amp; Company was commissioned to erect a new building in anticipation of the influx of visitors from the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition scheduled for 1893. The nine-story &quot;Annex&quot; at the northwest corner of Wabash and Washington Streets has opened under the direction of Burnham associate Charles B. Atwood in August 1893, towards the end of the Exposition. In 1897, the old 1879 store was rebuilt and had two additional floors added, while the first of Marshall Field&#x27;s iconic landmark Great Clocks was installed at the corner of State and Washington Streets on November 26.

In 1901, Marshall Field &amp; Company, previously a private partnership, was incorporated. Spurred on by Selfridge, Marshall Field razed the three buildings north of it, which had been occupied since 1888, as well as the Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan-designed 1879 Central Music Hall at the southeast corner of State and Randolph Streets in 1901. In their place rose a massive, twelve-story building fronting State Street in 1902, including a grand new entrance. In 1906, a third new building opened on Wabash Avenue north of the 1893 structure, which was then the oldest part of the store.

In the midst of the construction, Selfridge abruptly resigned from the company in 1904, buying a rival store Schlesinger &amp; Mayer, but sold it only three months later. Schlesinger &amp; Mayer in 1899 had commissioned the Louis Sullivan-designed building now known as the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building, which is the firm to which Selfridge sold the business. After trying retirement, he went on to establish Selfridges in London.

===Shedd era===
Marshall Field died on January 16, 1906, in New York City. On the day of his funeral, all the stores along State Street, big and small, closed and the Chicago Board of Trade suspended afternoon trading in his honor. The board of Marshall Field and Company appointed John G. Shedd, (1850–1926), whom Field had once called &quot;the greatest merchant in the United States&quot;, to serve as the company&#x27;s new president. Shedd became head of a company that employed 12,000 people in Chicago (two-thirds of them in retail) and was doing about $25 million in yearly retail sales in addition to nearly $50 million in wholesale.

Under Shedd&#x27;s leadership for the next 16 years, Marshall Field &amp; Co. continued to rebuild its store, fulfilling plans approved by Field himself to pull down the 1879 structure later in 1906. In its stead rose a new south State Street building with a continuation of the 1902 street façade. Opened in September 1907, it included a Louis Comfort Tiffany- decorated ceiling that is both the first and largest ceiling ever built in favrile glass, containing over 1.6 million pieces. With completion of the 1907 building, Marshall Field&#x27;s momentarily possessed the title of &quot;world&#x27;s largest department store&quot; over John Wanamaker &amp; Co. in Philadelphia and R.H. Macy &amp; Co. in New York.

In 1912, the 16-story Trude Building at the southwest corner of Wabash and Randolph was acquired and demolished, an act that was considered to be one of the first demolitions, if not the first, of a high-rise skyscraper of those just recently being built. In its place rose the 1914 building designed by the Graham, Burnham &amp; Company architectural firm, completing the present-day store and now encompassing the entire square city block, bounded by Washington, State, Wabash, and Randolph Streets.

Also in 1914, the same Graham, Burnham &amp; Company supervised the opening of a new twenty-story Marshall Field Annex across the street at 25 East Washington, which housed &quot;Marshall Field&#x27;s Store for Men&quot; on its first six floors. These buildings recaptured its status as the world&#x27;s largest department store, its many restaurants and separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lounges becoming an important social destination for upscale Chicago.

Shedd continued to expand Field&#x27;s wholesale business and grew its manufacturing business, buying textile mills in the South in 1911 (see Cannon Mills Company) as well as overseeing the purchase of the Marshall Field Trust&#x27;s interest in the business in 1917. The Field Family eventually retained only a ten percent stake. Second company president, John G. Shedd retired in late 1922.

===1913 Illinois State Senate investigation===
In 1913, representatives of Carson Pirie Scott and Marshall Field&#x27;s were called to the state capital of Illinois at Springfield for the Illinois State Senate&#x27;s investigation of the low wages of the female employees of the major department stores. At Marshall Field&#x27;s, women were not only typists or other types of clerical workers, they also had a major role in the sales department. Women sales clerks were trained in etiquette and acquired a thorough understanding of the merchandise. The presence of saleswomen was a crucial part of the success of Marshall Field&#x27;s, as they made female customers more comfortable and therefore made shopping at Marshall Field&#x27;s fun.

The opportunities available for women at Marshall Field&#x27;s created a subculture of working women. During the early and middle decades of the 20th century, many women migrated into the labor force often becoming adrift in a new city with new opportunities. Many of these women lived apart from family and relatives, were young and single and came from varied backgrounds and ethnicities. This subculture of women was greatly affected by wages and opportunities offered through Marshall Field&#x27;s.

However, the wages of the female employees were not representative of their role in the company and, therefore, became the subject of the 1913 Illinois Senate Investigation. Women were paid very low wages, the average being $5 to $8 per week. The &quot;testimony at an Illinois Senate investigation in 1913 from spokesmen for the Illinois Manufacturers&#x27; Association; banks; Sears, Roebuck; and Marshall Field&#x27;s revealed that most major employers paid women workers as low as $2.75 (~$ in ).&quot; Even in 1913, that was not a living wage. During the hearing, Marshall Field&#x27;s revealed that it could double the women&#x27;s salaries but refused to do so. Furthermore, women faced more mistreatment within the company such as sex segregation, which limited their mobility within the company.

===First branch stores and the Frango brand===

James Simpson was appointed president following Shedd&#x27;s retirement. Though considered to have favored the declining wholesale division, he did expand its retail operations, first buying A. M. Rothschild &amp; Co. at State Street and Jackson Boulevard in December 1923, which Field&#x27;s operated as a discount store called &quot;The Davis Store.&quot; In 1924, the 1893–1914 buildings that the store occupied were acquired from the Marshall Field Trust.

The first branch of Marshall Field&#x27;s itself opened at Market Square in Lake Forest, Illinois in May 1928. In September 1928, its first branch in Evanston, Illinois followed, later relocating to a French Renaissance-style building at Sherman Avenue and Church Street in November 1929. The Oak Park, Illinois store opened in September 1929 in a building similar to the Evanston store.
Frederick &amp; Nelson, a Seattle, Washington-based department store founded in 1890, was also acquired in 1929, with its own 1914 downtown Seattle building at Pine Street and Fifth Avenue. Frederick &amp; Nelson retained its name, though its logo was soon rewritten in Field&#x27;s iconic script. Frederick &amp; Nelson created Frango mints, a Seattle tradition then and now. The mints were later also produced in the candy kitchen in the State Street store and became popular in Chicago, too.

Marshall Field &amp; Company became a public company in 1930, early in the &quot;Great Depression&quot;. The retailer needed capital due to the expense of opening the massive new Merchandise Mart to house its flagging wholesale division. Ground was broken in 1927 during the boom years of the &quot;Roaring 20s&quot;; when the Mart opened in 1930, it was the largest building in the world. The 1887 Wholesale Store designed by Richardson at Franklin between Quincy and Adams Streets was closed and demolished at this time. But the new building, faced with a change in retail distribution and wholesale patterns in addition to the deepening &quot;Great Depression&quot;, could not save Field&#x27;s wholesale division. Simpson left the Company, and James O. McKinsey, a University of Chicago professor and founder of the McKinsey and Company consulting firm, was hired to reform the Company. The wholesale division, once the core of the Company, was liquidated by 1936. The Davis Store was closed in 1936 as well, and its building was sold to Goldblatts. In 1939, the land underlying the main State Street store was acquired from the Marshall Field Trust. Meanwhile, McKinsey also reorganized the Company&#x27;s vertically integrated operations, notably by merging the Company&#x27;s varied textile operations under the Fieldcrest name.

===Suburban expansion===

Following World War II, the Merchandise Mart building was sold in 1945 to Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., (1888–1969), significantly improving the Field Company&#x27;s finances and enabling the store to cope with the post-war suburban residential and commercial boom. Marshall Field&#x27;s presciently followed its customers to their new homes outwards to the suburbs, including opening a store in 1950 in partnership with pioneering suburban developer Philip M. Klutznick (a famous Jewish leader and later U.S. Secretary of Commerce) at his new Park Forest Plaza, which utilized revolutionary new concepts in land use and architecture.

In 1956, Klutznick and Field&#x27;s jointly opened Old Orchard Shopping Center in Skokie, Illinois, a center Klutznick developed on land that Field&#x27;s already owned; the development included a new Field&#x27;s store. This was followed by the 1959 opening of a Field&#x27;s store in the Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, to the northwest, and stores at later Klutznick-led shopping centers opened at Oakbrook Center in Oak Brook, Illinois, in 1962 and River Oaks Center in Calumet City, Illinois, in 1966.

Marshall Field&#x27;s even expanded further in the Pacific Northwest, acquiring The Crescent department store in Spokane, Washington, in 1962 and in 1970, moved east with the purchase of Halle Brothers Co., a leading department store in Cleveland, Ohio. Field&#x27;s also continued to expand its hometown base in Illinois, opening a store at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg in 1971.

CherryVale Mall in Rockford and Hawthorn Mall in Vernon Hills followed in 1973, and stores at Water Tower Place in Chicago and Fox Valley Mall in Aurora opened in 1975. The suburban expansion continued in 1976 with a location at Orland Square Mall in Orland Park, followed by the Louis Joliet Mall in Joliet in 1978. In 1979, Marshall Field&#x27;s expanded south into Texas with a store at The Galleria in Houston.

The year 1980 saw the rapid acquisition of J.B. Ivey Co., a department store chain with roots in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida; The Union Co. in Columbus, Ohio; the Lipman&#x27;s stores in Portland, Oregon; and several Liberty House stores in Washington state. Field&#x27;s existing Frederick &amp; Nelson unit in Seattle absorbed the Lipman&#x27;s and Liberty House stores under its name, but after initially merging The Union of Columbus, Ohio with its earlier Halle&#x27;s stores from Cleveland, Field&#x27;s decided to sell the combined chain in November 1981; the new owners quickly liquidated it.

The early 1980s saw slower expansion, with just two store locations in Illinois added, one in October 1980 at Spring Hill Mall in West Dundee, and one in 1981 at Stratford Square Mall in Bloomingdale. Another Texas store opened at the Dallas Galleria, in Dallas, Texas, in 1982.

===BATUS===
In 1982, Marshall Field &amp; Co. ceased to be a public company, being acquired by B.A.T. British-American Tobacco. As part of BATUS Retail Group, the American retailing arm of B.A.T., Field&#x27;s and its Frederick &amp; Nelson, Ivey&#x27;s and The Crescent department stores and the John Brueners home furnishings stores joined retailers Gimbels, Saks Fifth Avenue and Kohl&#x27;s. Field&#x27;s continued to expand under BATUS, adding stores at Houston&#x27;s Town &amp; Country Mall in 1983 and at the North Star Mall in San Antonio in 1986.

Only four years after buying Marshall Field&#x27;s, however, BATUS scaled back its retail operations in 1986, selling Field&#x27;s former subsidiaries Frederick &amp; Nelson and The Crescent to a local investor group. Frederick &amp; Nelson quickly deteriorated and became defunct in 1992. Its 1914 building, the one acquired by Field&#x27;s in 1929, was eventually bought by Nordstrom; the structure was renovated and reopened in 1998 as a replacement for Nordstrom&#x27;s own Seattle parent store.

BATUS closed its Gimbels division in 1986 and transferred five former Gimbels locations in Wisconsin to its Marshall Field&#x27;s division: downtown Milwaukee, Northridge Mall and Southridge Mall in Milwaukee, Hilldale Shopping Center in Madison and in downtown Appleton. The former Gimbels Northridge and Southridge locations were retained by Field&#x27;s for only three years; due to poor performance, they were sold in 1989 to H.C. Prange Co. of Sheboygan.

The Evanston and Oak Park stores were closed in 1986, their 1929 buildings deemed out of date and too costly to operate. A major restoration and renovation of the State Street flagship store led by Director of Construction and Maintenance Bill Allen commenced in 1987.

BATUS initially kept Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field&#x27;s, and Ivey&#x27;s; however, it sold all its remaining U.S. retail assets in 1990, with Saks going to Bahrain-based Investcorp, Ivey&#x27;s sold to Dillard&#x27;s, and Marshall Field&#x27;s sold to then Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation).

===Dayton-Hudson, Target, and May===
Dayton-Hudson Corporation renamed itself Target Corporation in 2000 and renamed its Dayton&#x27;s and Hudson&#x27;s department stores Marshall Field&#x27;s in 2001. These stores were outside of Field&#x27;s existing markets. Target Corporation introduced some of the brands carried there to the Marshall Field&#x27;s stores, displacing some of Field&#x27;s more expensive merchandise.

In 2004 Target Corporation sold the Marshall Field&#x27;s chain to May Co., exiting the traditional department store business entirely. It was hoped that aligning with the May Company instead of the discounter Target would &quot;let Field&#x27;s be Field&#x27;s&quot; and allow it to recapture its former cachet and upper-class customer base. However, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired the May Company in 2005.
===Federated acquisition, renaming and protest===

After the Federated purchase, Marshall Field&#x27;s stores joined L. S. Ayres and existing Macy&#x27;s stores in the new Macy&#x27;s North Division. During 2006, all Marshall Field&#x27;s stores, most Filene&#x27;s and all the stores of nine other May-owned chains were renamed Macy&#x27;s, the conversion officially occurred on September 9, 2006. Many Chicagoans resented the New York City brand replacing their local brand. Hundreds of protesters gathered under Marshall Field&#x27;s famous clock that day, and returned on the one-year anniversary, September 9, 2007. Dozens attended &quot;Field&#x27;s Fans&quot; rallies each anniversary from 2008 to 2012.

Many Chicagoans felt betrayed by Macy&#x27;s takeover of Marshall Field’s when the company began to change its aesthetics and customer service standards, and demoted many Chicago-based brands. In December 2006, Macy&#x27;s reported 30% slower sales in former Marshall Field&#x27;s stores; the focus shifted to promoting the State Street location in 2007.

===Renovations===
The Marshall Field and Company Building at State and Washington Streets in Chicago was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is part of the Loop Retail National Historic District. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 1, 2005. With approximately two million square feet of available floor space, the building is the second-largest department store in the United States.

In 1987, while under BATUS ownership, Field&#x27;s State Street store underwent significant restoration. In 2004, while Field&#x27;s was still owned by Dayton Hudson/Target, another extensive restoration of the landmark State Street store, costing $115 million (~$ in ), was begun; the last of the renovation was completed after the May acquisition. The 2004 renovations included the installation of new lower-level shops, removal of steel grates from the upper portions of the store&#x27;s historic light wells, and the addition of an eleven-story atrium in what had been an alley and mid-store light shaft.

In 2004, Field&#x27;s also introduced significant upgrades to merchandise and the introduction of luxury vendor relationships, in which 10% of the floor space was leased to outside vendors in a manner similar to Selfridge&#x27;s in London (Selfridge&#x27;s was founded by former Field&#x27;s executive Harry Selfridge, who based his business model on Marshall Field&#x27;s; likewise, the Selfridge&#x27;s building in London was based on the architecture of the Marshall Field&#x27;s store).

==Firsts, noted events, community leadership==
Among the &quot;firsts&quot; by Marshall Field&#x27;s was the concept of the department store tea room. In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having lunch at a downtown restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field&#x27;s clerk shared her lunch (a chicken pot pie) with a tired shopper, Field&#x27;s hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete their shopping. To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring&#x27;s chicken pot pie.

Marshall Field&#x27;s had the first European buying office, which was located in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field&#x27;s store, right up to the chain&#x27;s last days under the Marshall Field&#x27;s name. It was the first store to offer revolving credit and the first department store to use escalators. Marshall Field&#x27;s book department in the State Street store was legendary; it pioneered the concept of the &quot;book signing.&quot; Moreover, every year at Christmas, Marshall Field&#x27;s downtown store windows were filled with animated displays as part of the downtown shopping district display; the &quot;theme&quot; window displays became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting the Marshall Field&#x27;s windows at Christmas became a tradition for Chicagoans and visitors alike, as popular a local practice as visiting the Walnut Room with its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting &quot;under the clock&quot; on State Street.

Marshall Field was famous for his slogan &quot;Give the lady what she wants.&quot; He was also famous for his integrity, character, and community philanthropy and leadership. After his death, the company remained to the very end a major philanthropic contributor to its Chicago-area community.

Field, the store he created and his successor John G. Shedd, helped establish Chicago&#x27;s prominence throughout the world in business, art, culture, and education. The Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural History (as renamed in 1905 for its first major benefactor), the Museum of Science and Industry, the John G. Shedd Aquarium and the University of Chicago have all been aided by the philanthropy of Marshall Field&#x27;s. Marshall Field was also a major sponsor of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

<doc id="976663" wikidata="Q1055794" url="?curid=976663" title="Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets">
<text>Industrial and multiphase plugs and sockets provide a connection to the electrical mains rated at higher voltages and currents than household plugs and sockets. They are generally used in polyphase systems, with high currents, or when protection from environmental hazards is required. Industrial outlets may have weatherproof covers, waterproofing sleeves, or may be interlocked with a switch to prevent accidental disconnection of an energized plug. Some types of connectors are approved for hazardous areas such as coal mines or petrochemical plants, where flammable gas may be present.

Almost all three-phase power plugs have an earth (ground) connection, but may not have a neutral because three-phase loads such as motors do not need the neutral. Such plugs have only four prongs (earth, and the three phases). An example of a socket with neutral is the L21-30 (30 A) and the L21-20 (20 A) both of which have five pins (earth, neutral, and X, Y, Z phases).

While some forms of power plugs and sockets are set by international standards, countries may have their own different standards and regulations. For example, the colour-coding of wires may not be the same as for small mains plugs.

==Concepts and terminology==

Generally the plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device&#x27;s mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as &quot;male&quot;) that fit into matching slots or holes (called &quot;female&quot;) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an &quot;accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords&quot;, a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch or fuse is provided as a means of disconnecting the output from input). In this article, the term &#x27;plug&#x27; is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts.

To reduce the risk of users accidentally touching energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock, plug and socket systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the recessed slots or holes of the energized socket. These may include plugs with insulated sleeves, recessed sockets, sockets with blocking shutters, and sockets designed to accept only compatible plugs inserted in the correct orientation.

The term &quot;plug&quot; is in general and technical use in all forms of English, common alternatives being &quot;power plug&quot;, 
&quot;electric plug&quot;,
and (in the UK) &quot;plug top&quot;.
The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is &quot;socket-outlet&quot;,
but in non-technical common use a number of other terms are used.
In British English the general term is &quot;socket,&quot; but there are numerous common alternatives, including &quot;power point&quot;, &quot;plug socket&quot;,
&quot;wall socket&quot;,
and &quot;wall plug&quot;.
In American English &quot;receptacle&quot; and &quot;outlet&quot; are common, sometimes with qualifiers such as &quot;wall outlet&quot;, &quot;electrical outlet&quot; and &quot;electrical receptacle&quot;, all of these sometimes to be found in the same document.

Electrical sockets for industrial, commercial and domestic purposes generally provide two or more current carrying (live) connections to the supply conductors. These connections are classified as poles. A pole will be either a neutral connection or a line

Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as &quot;phase&quot; or &quot;hot&quot;, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as &quot;live&quot;) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth).

Single phase sockets are classified as two pole (2P) and provide a single line contact and a neutral contact. In addition, a protective earth (Ground in American terminology) contact is usually, but not always, present, in which case the socket is classified as two pole and earth(2P+E).

Three phase sockets provide three line contacts, they may also include either or both of a neutral and protective earth contact. The designations of the three contacts may vary. The IEC standards use the Line designations L1, L2 and L3. NEMA standards use the Phase designations X, Y and Z.

Sockets intended for use with the American split Phase distribution system may have two line contacts and neutral. In this case the line designators X and Y are used. They may also include a protective earth contact.

==Europe==


===IEC 60309 system===

In Europe, the most common range of heavy commercial and industrial connectors are made to IEC 60309 (formerly IEC 309) and various standards based on it (including BS 4343 and BS EN 60309-2). These are often referred to in the UK as CEE industrial, CEEform or simply CEE plugs, or as &quot;Commando connectors&quot; (after the MK Commando brand name for these connectors).

The maximum voltage rating of IEC 60309 connectors is 1000 V DC or AC; the maximum current rating is 800 A; and the maximum frequency 500 Hz. Plugs are available in P+N+E (unbalanced single phase with neutral), 2P+E (balanced single phase), 3P+E (3 phase without neutral), and 3P+N+E (three phase with neutral). Current ratings available include 16 A, 32 A, 63 A, 125 A and 200 A.

Voltage rating and other characteristics are represented by a colour code (in three-phase plugs the stated voltage is the phase-phase voltage, not the phase-neutral voltage). Plugs have the earth pin of a larger diameter than the others, and located in different places depending on the voltage rating, making it impossible to mate, for instance, a blue plug with a yellow socket. Since the different current ratings have different overall sizes, it is also not possible to mate different pin configurations or current ratings. For example, a 16 A 3P+E 400 V plug will not mate with a 16 A 3P+N+E 400 V socket and a 16 A P+N+E 230 V plug will not mate with a 32 A P+N+E 230 V socket.

Yellow 2P+E, blue P+N+E, yellow 3P+E, red 3P+E, and red 3P+N+E are by far the most common arrangements. Blue P+N+E sockets (generally 16 A, although 32 A is becoming more common) are used as standard by British and Danish campsites and yacht marinas to provide 240 V domestic mains power to frame-tents, trailer-tents, caravans, and boats; they are also used elsewhere in Europe for the same purpose, though in some countries the local domestic plug is also widely used. Static caravans generally use the similar 32 A version because of the requirement to power electrical cooking and heating appliances. The blue P+N+E 16 A version carrying 240 V is also used in shopping malls and their peripherals to power &#x27;temporary&#x27; stalls not incorporated within a lock-up shop, there is also use in domestic gardens within Britain to power garden equipment, barbecues, and temporary lighting. The yellow 2P+E 16 A version carrying 115 V is used extensively on the London Underground railway system to power temporary usage of heavy-duty fans; it is also frequently used by tradesmen within the UK, built into a portable transformer box that is powered from a standard 13 A 240 V mains supply, to run heavy-duty power-tools designed to operate at 115 V.

A small number of marinas provide 230 V single-phase power through a red three-phase connector (breaking the relevant standards in the process). This goes some way to ensuring that only boats that have paid the required fee (and thus obtained an appropriately made-up adaptor cable) are able to use the electricity.

For more detailed information, see the main article IEC 60309.

===Entertainment industry===
Throughout Europe, a common use of industrial power connectors is in the entertainment and broadcast industries.

In this industry the above-mentioned IEC 60309 connectors are referred to as &quot;CEEform&quot; (or just CEE) connectors. 230 V single-phase (blue) and 400 V three-phase (red) connectors between 16 A and 125 A ratings are used.

Where more current carrying capacity is required, such as between generator sets and distribution boards, VEAM Powerlocks or Cam-Loks may be used. These connectors are single pole so five are required to accommodate all three phases, neutral and ground. Powerlocks have a rating of 400 A or 660 A at 1 kV. Cam-Lok E1016 Series are rated at 600 V 400 A.

Powerlocks are identified with the European harmonized colour code, they are also annotated as follows:
* 
* 

Cam-Loks are also available in these colours.

Where it is necessary to run separate feeds through multicable, the Socapex 19-pin connector is often encountered on theatre and studio lighting rigs.

===UK: Lewden plugs===
Lewden plugs and sockets are metal bodied waterproof plugs and sockets made by Lewden. The pin arrangements of the smaller single phase varieties are the same as BS 1363 and BS 546 plugs and sockets. These plugs and sockets will mate with normal plugs and sockets of the same pin arrangement but they are only waterproof when a Lewden plug is used in a Lewden socket and the screw ring is properly tightened (sockets have a metal cover that screws on to waterproof them when not in use).

===UK: BS 196===
In 1930, the BS 196 standard for industrial plugs and sockets was introduced. The plugs are available in 5 A, 15 A and 30 A variants, with various configurations of keyways and pins to cater for different voltages. BS 196 plugs have now been superseded by BS 4343 (CEE type) connectors in most modern applications.

===Sweden, Germany and Netherlands: Perilex plugs ===

Perilex plugs and sockets are 5-pin 3-phase connectors. The system provides 400 V 3P+N+PE and exists in 16 A and 25 A versions. In Sweden, the 16 A is generally used for stoves and to some extent for other heating devices in kitchens.
In the Netherlands, Perilex is also used to connect fans with wired speed control (Switched L2 and L3 pins), but fans may not use three phase power

===Sweden: Semko 17 plugs ===
Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) or without (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were provided via the shield. The connectors were available in different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by &quot;Arbetsmiljöverket&quot;). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through the hands of a person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.

===Switzerland: SN 441011 ===
The Swiss standard &quot;SN 441011&quot; (until 2019 &quot;SEV 1011&quot;) &quot;Plugs and socket-outlets for household and similar purposes&quot;. defines a hierarchical system of plugs and sockets including both single and three phase connectors. Sockets will accept plugs with the same or fewer number of pins and the same or lower ratings. Single phase Swiss plugs and sockets are described in the main article SN 441011.

The type 15 plug and socket has 3 round pins of 4 mm diameter, plus 2 flat pins (for L2 and L3). It is designed for three phase applications and is rated at 10 A, 250 V/440 V. The socket will also accept types 11 and 12 plugs, and the Europlug.

The type 25 plug and socket has 3 rectangular pins, 4 mm x 5 mm, plus 2 flat pins (for L2 and L3). It is designed for three phase applications and is rated at 16 A, 250 V/440 V. The socket will accept types 11, 12, 21, and 23 single phase plugs, the Europlug, and types 15 and 25 three phase plugs.
===Former Yugoslavia===
This type of three phase plug and sockets are mainly used in households in former Yugoslavian countries, they are 5-pin 3-phase connectors, rated at 16 A, 380 V. Industrial 3-phase connectors are same as European IEC 60309.

==North America==

===Pin and sleeve===

In North America, there are two types of pin and sleeve products that are used:

==== NEMA ====
The American pin and sleeve circular connectors are not compatible with the newer IEC 60309 type. Current ratings are 30, 60, 100, 200, and 400 A. All are rated for voltages up to 250 V DC or 600 V AC. Contact arrangements are from 2 to 4 pins. There are two styles depending on the treatment of the ground. Style 1 grounds only on the shell. Style 2 uses one of the contacts as well as the shell, internally connected together. They are not strongly typed for specific circuits and voltages as the IEC 309 are. One insert rotation option is available to prevent mating of similar connectors with different voltages.

The contacts in the plug are simple cylinders (sleeves), while the pin contacts in the receptacle have the spring arrangement to hold contact pressure, the reverse of the IEC 60309 type connectors. All contacts are the same diameter. Originally metal construction was used, but now they are also made with plastic shells. Since only keying in the connector shell is used, and since the keys can be damaged in industrial use, it is possible to mis-match worn connectors.

==== IEC ====
IEC 60309 Series II (North American) pin and sleeve connectors have gained significant traction in North America over the course of the last 30 years . Series II current ratings are 20, 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, 350, 500 and 600 amps. The voltage ratings go up to 1000 V AC. These have been replacing the American-style for some time and are much more likely to be found in food processing, data centers, healthcare, entertainment, and other industries.

===NEMA connectors===

NEMA devices are not exclusively industrial devices, and some types are found in nearly all buildings in the United States. &quot;Industrial-grade&quot; connectors are constructed to meet or exceed the requirements of more stringent industry testing standards, and are more heavily built to withstand damage than residential and light commercial connectors of the same type. Industrial devices may also be constructed to be dust or water-tight. NEMA wiring devices are made in current ratings from 15–60 A, and voltage ratings from 125–600 V.

There are two basic configurations of NEMA plug and socket: straight-blade and locking. Numbers prefixed by &quot;L&quot; are twist-lock, others are straight blade. Locking type connectors are found mostly in industrial applications and are not common in residential and light commercial use.

==== Twist-locking connectors ====

Twist-locking connectors were first invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and &quot;Twist-Lock&quot; remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated to this day, although the term tends to be used generically to refer to NEMA twist-locking connectors manufactured by any company. Twist-locking connectors all use curved blades that have shapes that conform to portions of the circumference of a circle. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated prongs latch into the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a very reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings.

Like non-locking connectors, these come in a variety of standardized configurations and follow the same general naming scheme except that they all begin with an &quot;L&quot; for &quot;locking&quot;. The connector families are designed so that 120 V connectors, 208/240 V connectors, and various other, higher-voltage connectors can not be accidentally intermated.

===Stage pin connectors===

A &quot;stage pin connector&quot; (SPC), or &quot;grounded stage pin&quot; (GSP), is a connector used primarily in the theatre industry for stage lighting applications in the United States. Stage pin connectors are generally used for conducting dimmed power from a dimmer to stage lighting instruments, although occasionally they can power other equipment.

The primary advantage of the stage pin connector over the NEMA 5-15 connector (commonly known as an Edison connector in the theatre industry) is its increased durability and resistance to damage due to its more robust construction and the ability to compensate for wear with a pin splitter. Having a distinct connector designated for dimmable power also helps prevent confusion of dimmed and non-dimmed circuits which could lead to equipment damage. Even the smallest stage pin connectors are rated for 20 A, which translates to 2.4 kW at 120 V, compared to the 15 A and 1.8 kW of the NEMA 5-15. In applications where cables are on the floor, the low profile of the connector allows for connections that are only slightly higher than the cables they connect.

===California 50 A Connector===

In North America for moderate current requirements the 50 A California-style connector, also known as CS6364 and CS6365 is commonly used. It features a twist-lock design with a metal sleeve full protecting the blades on the male connector and a center ground spike on the female connector to aid in centering.

California connectors are commonly used at outdoor events, shows and conventions and at construction sites. The connector gets its name from being developed as a safer connector during the early days of Hollywood film studios in California. The first high-current connectors used in the studios were stage pin (also referred to as &quot;paddle plugs&quot;) used in theaters, which were not grounded. The California plug, however, is grounded by the outer steel shroud. This also helped protect the male contact pins from damage from the constant dragging of cables around a set throughout the day. The grounded shroud helps absorb the arc-flash if the connector is plugged or unplugged while energized. The original paddle plugs were known for dangerous arc-flashes, especially in the older DC-powered theaters in the early years of electrical stage lighting.

For example, a three phase plug which requires a neutral connection cannot be inserted into a socket outlet which does not provide for such a connection. However, a plug which does not require a neutral connection can be inserted into a socket outlet which provides such a connection, although the neutral connection would not be utilized in that situation.

For stage lighting use, a common plug is the 32-A 5-pin connector with a neutral pin. Motor loads that don&#x27;t need the neutral use a four-pin connector. Larger requirements may use powerlock or camlock connectors. In the IT industry, the IEC 60309 system is sometimes used.

==Australia==

In Australia, New Zealand and many associated South Pacific island nations, the AS/NZS 3123 standard is used. In this series, multiple sizes of three-phase round-pin socket are standardized by current rating and neutral circuit. Each socket within a group accepts plugs in the same group up to its rating, but excludes plugs with a higher current rating, from a different group, or with a neutral pin (if there is not one in the socket). Multiphase plugs and sockets are rated at up to 500 V and all include an earth connection. These plugs and sockets are usually IP56 rated if fitted correctly. A screw collar helps hold plug and socket together.

In the single-phase standard AS/NZS 3112 used in residential environments, plugs of lower current rating may be inserted into single phase socket outlets of higher current rating but not vice versa. While this feature is somewhat reflected with multiphase sockets, it is further limited to only plugs within the same group. For example, there is one group that consists of 32 A, 40 A and 50 A connectors, and another group of 50 A, 63 A and 80 A connectors. The 32 A plug can be connected to any of the 32 A, 40 A or 50 A sockets in the first group, however it cannot be connected to any of the 50 A, 63 A or 80 A sockets in the second group. The standard notes that there are two different, incompatible 50 A connectors that are not interchangeable as they are physically different sizes.

Compatibility is grouped like this, such that larger sockets in one group can take the same plug or any smaller plugs from that group only:

Each of the three phase plugs and sockets are available as 4-pin (without neutral) or 5-pin (with neutral). A plug without a neutral pin can be inserted into a socket carrying neutral, but the reverse is not possible as the neutral pin blocks insertion into a socket that does not have a hole for the neutral conductor.

From this it can be seen that, for example, installing a 32 A, 250 V socket will only be compatible with a 32 A plug and it will not be possible to insert 10 A or 20 A plugs.

Within each size group, the plugs and sockets are keyed with certain &quot;lugs&quot; protruding on the outside of the plugs. Higher current plugs have more lugs to prevent them from being inserted into a lower current socket outlet, while still allowing them to be inserted into a socket outlet of the same size group rated for a higher current. For example, a 32 A 4-pin plug without neutral can plug into a 50 A 5-pin socket with neutral available.

However a 10 A 5-pin plug cannot fit a 32 A 5-pin socket, as the plugs are in different groups and not only are their diameters different, but the position of the conductors also varies by a few degrees (for example the group 7/8 32 A plug has its L and N pins at 9 o&#x27;clock and 3 o&#x27;clock, while the group 1/2 20 A plug has its L and N pins at 10 o&#x27;clock and 2 o&#x27;clock instead.)

There are also metal clad plugs and sockets that go up to 63 A ratings, at a significantly higher cost.

<doc id="976666" wikidata="Q6901742" url="?curid=976666" title="Monomial basis">
<text>In mathematics the monomial basis of a polynomial ring is its basis (as a vector space or free module over the field or ring of coefficients) that consists of all monomials. The monomials form a basis because every polynomial may be uniquely written as a finite linear combination of monomials (this is an immediate consequence of the definition of a polynomial).

==One indeterminate==

The polynomial ring of univariate polynomials over a field is a -vector space, which has 
formula_1
as an (infinite) basis. More generally, if is a ring then is a free module which has the same basis.

The polynomials of degree at most form also a vector space (or a free module in the case of a ring of coefficients), which has formula_2 as a basis.

The canonical form of a polynomial is its expression on this basis:
formula_3
or, using the shorter sigma notation:
formula_4

The monomial basis is naturally totally ordered, either by increasing degrees
formula_5
or by decreasing degrees
formula_6

==Several indeterminates==

In the case of several indeterminates formula_7 a monomial is a product
formula_8
where the formula_9 are non-negative integers. As formula_10 an exponent equal to zero means that the corresponding indeterminate does not appear in the monomial; in particular formula_11 is a monomial.

Similar to the case of univariate polynomials, the polynomials in formula_12 form a vector space (if the coefficients belong to a field) or a free module (if the coefficients belong to a ring), which has the set of all monomials as a basis, called the monomial basis.

The homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_13 form a subspace which has the monomials of degree formula_14 as a basis. The dimension of this subspace is the number of monomials of degree formula_13, which is 
formula_16
where formula_17 is a binomial coefficient.

The polynomials of degree at most formula_13 form also a subspace, which has the monomials of degree at most formula_13 as a basis. The number of these monomials is the dimension of this subspace, equal to
formula_20

In contrast to the univariate case, there is no natural total order of the monomial basis in the multivariate case. For problems which require choosing a total order, such as Gröbner basis computations, one generally chooses an &quot;admissible&quot; monomial order – that is, a total order on the set of monomials such that

<text>In mathematics, a Hilbert–Schmidt operator, named after David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt, is a bounded operator formula_1 that acts on a Hilbert space formula_2 and has finite Hilbert–Schmidt norm

formula_3

where formula_4 is an orthonormal basis. The index set formula_5 need not be countable. However, the sum on the right must contain at most countably many non-zero terms, to have meaning. This definition is independent of the choice of the orthonormal basis. 
In finite-dimensional Euclidean space, the Hilbert–Schmidt norm formula_6 is identical to the Frobenius norm.

==‖·‖ is well defined==
The Hilbert–Schmidt norm does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis. Indeed, if formula_7 and formula_8 are such bases, then
formula_9
If formula_10 then formula_11 As for any bounded operator, formula_12 Replacing formula_13 with formula_14 in the first formula, obtain formula_15 The independence follows.

== Examples ==

An important class of examples is provided by Hilbert–Schmidt integral operators. 
Every bounded operator with a finite-dimensional range (these are called operators of finite rank) is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. 
The identity operator on a Hilbert space is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator if and only if the Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. 
Given any formula_16 and formula_17 in formula_18, define formula_19 by formula_20, which is a continuous linear operator of rank 1 and thus a Hilbert–Schmidt operator; 
moreover, for any bounded linear operator &quot;formula_21&quot; on formula_18 (and into formula_18), formula_24. 

If formula_25 is a bounded compact operator with eigenvalues formula_26 of formula_27, where each eigenvalue is repeated as often as its multiplicity, then formula_28 is Hilbert–Schmidt if and only if formula_29, in which case the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of formula_28 is formula_31. 

If formula_32, where formula_33 is a measure space, then the integral operator formula_34 with kernel formula_35 is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator and formula_36.

== Space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators ==

The product of two Hilbert–Schmidt operators has finite trace-class norm; therefore, if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are two Hilbert–Schmidt operators, the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product can be defined as

formula_37

The Hilbert–Schmidt operators form a two-sided *-ideal in the Banach algebra of bounded operators on . 
They also form a Hilbert space, denoted by or , which can be shown to be naturally isometrically isomorphic to the tensor product of Hilbert spaces

formula_38

where is the dual space of . 
The norm induced by this inner product is the Hilbert–Schmidt norm under which the space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators is complete (thus making it into a Hilbert space). 
The space of all bounded linear operators of finite rank (i.e. that have a finite-dimensional range) is a dense subset of the space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators (with the Hilbert–Schmidt norm). 

The set of Hilbert–Schmidt operators is closed in the norm topology if, and only if, is finite-dimensional.

== Properties ==

* Every Hilbert–Schmidt operator is a compact operator. 
* A bounded linear operator is Hilbert–Schmidt if and only if the same is true of the operator formula_39, in which case the Hilbert–Schmidt norms of &quot;T&quot; and |&quot;T&quot;| are equal. 
* Hilbert–Schmidt operators are nuclear operators of order 2, and are therefore compact operators. 
* If formula_40 and formula_41 are Hilbert–Schmidt operators between Hilbert spaces then the composition formula_42 is a nuclear operator.
* If is a bounded linear operator then we have formula_43. 
* is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator if and only if the trace formula_44 of the nonnegative self-adjoint operator formula_45 is finite, in which case formula_46.
* If is a bounded linear operator on and is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator on then formula_47, formula_48, and formula_49. In particular, the composition of two Hilbert–Schmidt operators is again Hilbert–Schmidt (and even a trace class operator). 
* The space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators on is an ideal of the space of bounded operators formula_50 that contains the operators of finite-rank.
* If is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator on then formula_51 where formula_4 is an orthonormal basis of &quot;H&quot;, and formula_53 is the Schatten norm of formula_21 for . In Euclidean space, formula_6 is also called the Frobenius norm.

<text>Caleb Azariah Paul Southwell (18 July 1913 – 18 May 1979) was the second Premier and first Chief Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean. He also worked as a teacher, police officer, and trade unionist.

== Early life and career ==

Southwell was born in Dominica on 18 July 1913 to Joseph and Amelia Southwell. At 13 years of age, Southwell became a teacher and later joined the Leeward Islands Police Force in 1938. He served in Antigua, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Anguilla until he retired from the force in 1944.

In 1944, Southwell became an employee of the Saint Kitts Sugar Factory where he worked as a timekeeper and assistant stock clerk until the end of the sugar factory workers strike in 1948. Southwell joined the St. Kitts and Nevis Trades and Labour Union and Saint Kitts and Nevis Workers League (now the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party) in 1946 and remained vice president of the Union from 1946 until his death.

== Political career ==

First elected to the Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Legislative Council in 1952, Southwell was appointed to the Executive Council in 1955 and served as the First Minister of Communications and Works in 1956. Southwell was appointed as the first Chief Minister of Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla in 1960. He was later appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance, Trade, Development, Industry and Tourism in several Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw administrations from 1967-1978, and assumed the position of full Premier on the death of Bradshaw on 23 May 1978.

== Death ==

Southwell died of a heart disease on 18 May 1979, less than one year after becoming Premier, in Castries, Saint Lucia. The death occurred during a meeting of the West Indies Associated States Council of Ministers. He was succeeded by his Deputy Premier, Lee Moore.

== Legacy ==
The Industrial Park in St. Kitts was named in his honor

Sir William Scott of Scot&#x27;s Hall in Smeeth, Kent (1459 – 24 August 1524) was Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

==Family==
William Scott was the son of Sir John Scott and Agnes Beaufitz, daughter and co-heiress of William Beaufitz. His sister, Elizabeth Scott (d. 15 August 1528), married Sir Edward Poynings.

==Career==
Scott rose to favour following the seizure of the throne by Henry VII. Within a few years he had been appointed to the Privy Council, appointed Comptroller of the Household and in 1489 was created a Companion of the Bath at the same ceremony as Prince Arthur. He served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1491, 1501 and 1510, and was also to become Constable of Dover Castle, Marshal of Calais (1490-1) and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports (1492–1493). He remained in favour under Henry VIII, being present at the famous meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 and one of the deputation sent to greet Emperor Charles V when he landed at Dover in 1522.

Scott inherited the manor of Brabourne in 1495, and had Scot&#x27;s Hall elaborately rebuilt so that it came to be regarded as one of the foremost houses in Kent.

He was buried at Brabourne, where there is a memorial brass to him in the Scott chapel in St Mary&#x27;s church.

==Marriage and issue==

Scott married Sibyl Lewknor, the daughter of Sir Thomas Lewknor (d. 20 July 1484) of Trotton, Sussex, and Katherine Pelham (d.1481), widow of John Bramshott (d.1468), and daughter of Sir John Pelham, Chamberlain to Katherine of Valois, by whom he had two sons and four daughters:

*Sir John Scott (d. 7 October 1533), who married Anne Pympe, daughter and heiress of Sir Reynold Pympe, esquire, of Nettlestead, Kent, by Elizabeth or Isabel Pashley, daughter of John Pashley, esquire, by whom he had five sons and seven daughters.
*Edward Scott of The Moat, Sussex, who married Alice Fogge, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Fogge, sergeant porter of Calais. After Scott&#x27;s death his widow married Sir Robert Oxenbridge.
*Anne Scott, who married Sir Edward Boughton.
*Katherine Scott.
*Elizabeth Scott.

<doc id="976703" wikidata="Q70625306" url="?curid=976703" title="Menangle pararubulavirus">
<text>Menangle pararubulavirus, also called Menangle virus, is a virus that infects pigs, humans and bats.

==History==
Menangle virus was first identified in 1997 after a piggery in Menangle near Sydney, NSW, Australia experienced a high number of stillbirths and deformities during farrowing. Two workers at the piggery came down with an unexplained serious flu-like illness, but subsequently recovered. They later tested positive for Menangle virus antibodies. This outbreak was quickly controlled through disinfection and temporary depopulation of individual units in the pig farm.

==Vector==
The source of the outbreak may have been a nearby population of fruit bats or &quot;flying foxes&quot;. Bats appear to be an asymptomatic host. Infection is thought to occur through serious contact with bodily fluids from infected animals (i.e. blood and possibly foetal matter).

Menangle is related to the recently discovered Tioman virus which is also bat-borne.

Menangle is one of three recently discovered zoonotic viruses in Australia that are carried by bats. The others are Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV or bat rabies).

==Virus appearance==
Like all paramyxoviruses, Menangle virus has an envelope, negative sense ssRNA, and pleomorphic (both spherical and elongated forms) proteins (HN and fusion) which protrude from the surface as spikes that help the virus get into cells. As an RNA virus, it must enter the cell to replicate.

==Clinical signs and symptoms==
Swine: Reduced conception rates; reduced litter size; large number of stillborn fetuses (some with severe skeletal/craniofacial defects); virus found in the lungs, brain and heart of stillborn piglets; No signs of illnesses in pigs of any age after birth.

Humans: Illness lasts for 10–14 days; fever; chills; rigors; drenching sweats; malaise; headache; red spotty rash.

Bats: Asymptomatic

==Post-mortem lesions==
Hydranencephaly: meaning the cerebral cortex has a large cavity where the cerebral hemispheres are missing and is instead filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

Limbs are often rigid and hyperflexed.

Uneven alignment of upper and lower teeth.

<text>A soffit is an exterior architectural feature, generally the horizontal, aloft underside of the roof edge. Its archetypal form, sometimes incorporating or implying the projection of rafters or trusses over the exterior of supporting walls, is the underside of eaves (to connect a supporting wall to projecting edge(s) of the roof). The vertical band at the edge of the roof is called a fascia. A soffit of an arch is frequently called an intrados.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;soffit&quot; is from , formed as a ceiling; and directly from &quot;suffictus&quot; for &quot;suffixus&quot;, , to fix underneath).

==Soffits in homes and offices==
In architecture, soffit is the underside (but not base) of any construction element.

Examples include: 
==Under the eaves of a roof==

In foremost use &quot;soffit&quot; is the first definition in the table above. In spatial analysis, it is one of the two necessary planes of any (3-dimensional) optionally built area, eaves, which projects, for such area to be within the building&#x27;s space.

In two-dimensional face analysis it is a discrete face almost always parallel with the ground that bridges the gap(s) between a building&#x27;s siding (walls) and either: their parallel extraneous plane (fascia) where such exists; or where no such plane, a point along (or the abrupt end of) the roof&#x27;s outer projection (overhang). Soffits and fascias are archetypally screwed or nailed to rafters known as lookout rafters or &quot;lookouts&quot; for short, their repair being often undertaken simultaneously. A parapet wall or cornice tend to preclude eaves, as an alternate design, both favouring flat roofs and weather-proof walls. Very pronounced overhangs (eaves) are characteristic to European architecture to shield the walls from rain, sleet and snow such as Swiss chalet style, Dutch, Romanian, and Tudor architecture.

Soffit exposure profile (from wall to fascia) on a building&#x27;s exterior can vary from a few centimetres (2–3 inches) to 3 feet or more, depending on construction. It can be non-ventilated or ventilated, to prevent condensation. A grill that covers the venting opening on the bottom of the soffit is called a soffit vent. A soffit joist can be added to the framework instead of or in addition to lookouts.

<text>Soffioni (; sometimes spelt &quot;suffioni&quot;), a name applied in Italy to certain volcanic vents which emit jets of steam, generally associated with hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, sometimes also with a little ammonia and marsh gas.

The soffioni are usually arranged in groups, and are best represented in the Maremma of Tuscany, where they contain a small proportion of boric acid, for which they are utilized industrially.

<doc id="976730" wikidata="Q233523" url="?curid=976730" title="Safe operating area">
<text>For power semiconductor devices (such as BJT, MOSFET, thyristor or IGBT), the safe operating area (SOA) is defined as the voltage and current conditions over which the device can be expected to operate without self-damage.
SOA is usually presented in transistor datasheets as a graph with VCE (collector-emitter voltage) on the abscissa and ICE (collector-emitter current) on the ordinate; the safe &#x27;area&#x27; referring to the area under the curve. The SOA specification combines the various limitations of the device — maximum voltage, current, power, junction temperature, secondary breakdown — into one curve, allowing simplified design of protection circuitry.

Often, in addition to the continuous rating, separate SOA curves are also plotted for short duration pulse conditions (1 ms pulse, 10 ms pulse, etc.).

The safe operating area curve is a graphical representation of the power handling capability of the device under various conditions. The SOA curve takes into account the wire bond current carrying capability, transistor junction temperature, internal power dissipation and secondary breakdown limitations.

==Limits of the safe operating area==
Where both current and voltage are plotted on logarithmic scales, the borders of the SOA are straight lines:
SOA specifications are useful to the design engineer working on power circuits such as amplifiers and power supplies as they allow quick assessment of the limits of device performance, the design of appropriate protection circuitry, or selection of a more capable device. SOA curves are also important in the design of foldback circuits.

==Secondary breakdown==
&quot;For a device that makes use of the secondary breakdown effect see Avalanche transistor&quot;

Secondary breakdown is a failure mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads to the destruction of the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with forward and reverse base drive. Except at low collector-emitter voltages, the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device. Older power MOSFETs did not exhibit secondary breakdown, with their safe operating area being limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the bonding wires), maximum power dissipation and maximum voltage. This has changed in more recent devices as detailed in the next section. However, power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling secondary breakdown.

==MOSFET thermal runaway in linear mode==
In their early history, MOSFETs became known for their absence of secondary breakdown. This benefit was due to the fact that ON-resistance increases with increasing temperature, so that part of the MOSFET which is running hotter (e.g. due to irregularities in the die-attachment, etc.) will carry a lower current density, tending to even out any temperature variation and prevent hot spots. Recently, MOSFETs with very high transconductance, optimised for switching operation, have become available. When operated in linear mode, especially at high drain-source voltages and low drain currents, the gate-source voltage tends to be very close to the threshold voltage. Unfortunately the threshold voltage decreases as temperature increases, so that if there are any slight temperature variations across the chip, then the hotter regions will tend to carry more current than the cooler regions when Vgs is very close to Vth. This can lead to thermal runaway and the destruction of the MOSFET even when it is operating within its Vds, Id and Pd ratings. Some (usually expensive) MOSFETs are specified for operation in the linear region and include DC SOA diagrams, e.g. IXYS IXTK8N150L.

==Reverse bias safe operating area==
Transistors require some time to turn off, due to effects such as minority carrier storage time and capacitance. While turning off, they may be damaged depending on how the load responds (especially with poorly snubbed inductive loads). The reverse bias safe operating area (or RBSOA) is the SOA during the brief time before turning the device into the off state—during the short time when the base current bias is reversed. As long as the collector voltage and collector current stay within the RBSOA during the entire turnoff, the transistor will be undamaged. Typically the RBSOA will be specified for a variety of turn-off conditions, such as shorting the base to the emitter, but also faster turn-off protocols where the base-emitter voltage bias is reversed.

The RBSOA shows distinct dependencies compared to the normal SOA. For example in IGBTs the high-current, high-voltage corner of the RBSOA is cut out when the collector voltage increases too quickly. Since the RBSOA is associated with a very brief turn-off process, it is not constrained by the continuous power dissipation limit.

The ordinary safe operating area (when the device is in the on state) may be referred to as the Forward bias safe operating area (or FBSOA) when it is possible to confuse it with the RBSOA.

==Protection==
The most common form of SOA protection used with bipolar junction transistors senses the collector-emitter current with a low-value series resistor. The voltage across this resistor is applied to a small auxiliary transistor that progressively &#x27;steals&#x27; base current from the power device as it passes excess collector current.

Another style of protection is to measure the temperature of the outside of the transistor, as an estimate of junction temperature, and reduce drive to the device or switch it off if the temperature is too high. If multiple transistors are used in parallel, only a few need to be monitored for case temperature to protect all parallel devices. 
This approach is effective but not bullet-proof. In practice, it is very difficult to design a protection circuit that will work under all conditions, and it is left up to the design engineer to weigh the likely fault conditions against the complexity and cost of the protection.

<text>HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 21 October 1937, launched on 6 June 1939, and commissioned 30 June 1941. &quot;Euryalus&quot; was the last cruiser built at the dockyard.

== Mediterranean service ==
=== Malta convoys ===
On 17 September 1941 &quot;Euryalus&quot; joined the escort for convoy WS 11X from Glasgow to Gibraltar. From 24 to 30 September 1941 she was part of Operation Halberd, one of the Malta Convoys. Nine fast freighters, escorted by the battleships , and , the aircraft carrier , cruisers , , , HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; and , and eighteen destroyers sailed from Gibraltar. Two days later the force was spotted by Italian scout planes. Italian air attacks launched from Sardinia began on 27 September. The battleship &quot;Nelson&quot; was hit by a torpedo north of the Galite Islands. That evening the freighter &quot;Imperial Star&quot; was sunk north of Cap Bon. On 1 October &quot;Euryalus&quot; became part of Force W at Gibraltar.

&quot;Euryalus&quot; joined the 15th Cruiser Squadron at Alexandria on 11 November 1941 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. On 24 November she deployed with Force B, including the cruisers , , and , to search for convoys on passage to Benghazi. On 15 December 1941 &quot;Euryalus&quot;, &quot;Naiad&quot; and eight destroyers deployed from Alexandria under Rear-Admiral Philip Vian as an escort for the freighter , bound for Malta. On 17 December Vian&#x27;s force rendezvoused with Force K from Malta, and a brief engagement took place with units of the Italian fleet. &quot;Euryalus&quot; and the rest of the squadron sailed for Alexandria the following day.

On 12 February 1942 &quot;Euryalus&quot; was part of Vian&#x27;s Force B deployed to cover Convoy MW 9, with HMS &quot;Naiad&quot;, and eight destroyers. The convoy came under heavy German air attack on 14 February, and the merchant ship &quot;Clan Chattan&quot; was scuttled. Vian&#x27;s ships returned to Alexandria on the morning of 15 February.

== Service in the Far East ==
&quot;Euryalus&quot; joined the 4th Cruiser Squadron at Trincomalee, Ceylon in January 1945, becoming part of the British Eastern Fleet. On 24 January she took part in Operation Meridian I, covering carrier-launched attacks on refineries at Pladjoe, Sumatra. On 2 February &quot;Euryalus&quot; arrived at Fremantle, Australia, to transfer to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF).

=== British Pacific Fleet ===

&quot;Euryalus&quot; arrived at Sydney on 11 February 1945. She sailed from there on 28 February to the British Forward Base at Manus, where she joined the British Pacific Fleet on arrival on 7 March. There the fleet awaited the approval of the US Chiefs of Staff for Royal Navy ships to join US Navy operations in the south-west Pacific. On 17 March &quot;Euryalus&quot; sailed for the US Navy Assembly area at Ulithi to join in USN operations. She arrived there on 20 March arrived and joined the United States Fifth Fleet for operations against Japan and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). On 23 March she sailed from Ulithi as part of CTU 6 with the 25th, 27th and 4th RAN destroyer flotillas to join US operations off the Sakishima Gunto islands group, as part of Operation Iceberg 1. On 1 April she transferred with the Task Force 57 carriers to cover air attacks on Formosa. On 12 April, as part of Operation Iceberg Oolong, she provided covered during attacks on Shinchiku and Matsugama. The next day &quot;Euryalus&quot; rejoined US ships off Sakishima Gunto. She deployed with Task Force 57 during the final strike of Phase 1 of the Sakishima Gunto attacks. On 1 May she rejoined US Task Force 45 with Task Force 57 carriers to continue the attacks on Sakishima Gunto. Three days later Operation Iceberg 2 began, resuming the attacks on Sakishima Gunto.

On 27 May &quot;Euryalus&quot;, with the other ships of the Royal Navy, transferred to US Task Force 37, as changes were made in the organisation of the US Fleet. She was at Brisbane on 4 June for repair and maintenance, then sailed to Manus. From Manus she sailed on 6 July for operations in preparation for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Japan. On 17 July she deployed with Task Force 37, joining ships of US Task Force 38 to provide cover during air attacks on targets in the Tokyo – Yokohama area, including airfields and the seaplane base at Kitaura. On 24 July she covered Task Force 37 carriers during air attacks on Osaka and Katori as well as attacks on shipping. On 9 August she covered the same Task Force during attacks on airfields and shipping in north Honshu and Hokkaido. On 12 August she took passage to Manus due to a shortage of fuel oil from British support tankers.

&quot;Euryalus&quot; transferred back to Royal Navy control on 15 August, after the surrender of Japan. She arrived back at Manus on 18 August and on 27 August sailed as TU.111.2 with the carriers HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; and , the cruisers , , and the destroyers , and for the reoccupation of Hong Kong. On 29 August 1945 she entered Hong Kong with HMS &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and the landing ship .

=== Post-war service ===
&quot;Euryalus&quot; was the last original &quot;Dido&quot; operational in Royal Navy, until 1954, mainly on the South Atlantic station. The ship was the most modernised of the original &quot;Dido&quot;s, having been extensively updated from October 1943 to June 1944 at John Brown on the Clyde with new light anti-aircraft armament of 20 mm, 40 mm and 2-pounder mountings and a generally new radar suite with Type 293 radar the standard post-war Royal Navy target indicator and close-range air and surface search, Type 272 heightfinders and surface warning and new navigation radar. After the end of World War II &quot;Euryalus&quot; spent 18 further months in the Pacific Fleet operating from Sydney, Japan and Hong Kong before returning to the UK for a year-long modernisation at Rosyth in 1947–48. By this time the long range airwarning radar on &quot;Euryalus&quot; was the late war Type 279b/281, the precursor of the post-1945, Type 960. Photos reveal that &quot;Euryalus&quot;″s turrets were also modified externally in the same way as ″s and ″s with the insertion in the turret for operators of a large Perspex sighting windows. In the early 1950s a major modernisation was planned for &quot;Dido&quot;-class cruisers &quot;Phoebe&quot;, &quot;Diadem&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, refitting them in a similar pattern to HMS &quot;Royalist&quot; with the further improvement of new boilers, similar to those of the . The $4.5 million cost of &quot;Royalist&quot;″s update to a 1950s fleet picket standard ruled this out.

<text>Piero di Tommaso Soderini (March 17, 1451 – June 13, 1522), also known as Pier Soderini, was an Italian statesman of the Republic of Florence.

==Biography==
Soderini was born in Florence to Tommaso di Lorenzo Soderini, a member of an old family who had become famous in medicine, and his second wife Dianora Tornabuoni, also of a prestigious Florentine family and in-law of Piero di Cosimo de&#x27; Medici. Soderini&#x27;s brother was the statesman and supporter of Girolamo Savonarola, Paolo Antonio Soderini. Their third brother was Cardinal Francesco Soderini, bishop of Volterra. In 1481 he was Prior of the city, and later became a favourite of Piero di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, receiving from him, in 1493, the honour of being the Ambassador to the Kingdom of France. He was elected &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; for life in 1502 by the Florentines, who wished to give greater stability to their republican institutions, which had been restored after the expulsion of Piero de&#x27; Medici and the execution of Savonarola.

Soderini&#x27;s rule proved moderate and wise, although he did not possess the qualities of a great statesman. He introduced a system of national militia in the place of foreign mercenaries. During his government the long war with Pisa was brought to a close with the capture of that city by the Florentines in 1509. Niccolò Machiavelli, author of &quot;The Prince&quot; and &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;, served under him as second chancellor and as ambassador to Cesare Borgia, Rome and France. Although Machiavelli initially had much respect for Soderini, his attitude was changed by the events that led to Soderini&#x27;s fall.

Grateful to France, which had assisted him, Soderini always took the French side in Italian politics. But in 1512 the Medici returned to Florence with the help of a Spanish army, deposed Soderini, and drove him into exile. He took refuge at Orašac (near Dubrovnik) in Dalmatia, where he remained until the election of Pope Leo X, who summoned him to Rome and conferred many favours on him. Soderini lived in Rome for the rest of his life and worked for the good of Florence, to which he was never allowed to return.

He died in Rome in 1522 and was buried in the church of S. Maria del Popolo.

<doc id="976740" wikidata="Q650657" url="?curid=976740" title="Neptunbrunnen (Berlin)">
<text>The Neptune Fountain () in Berlin was built in 1891 and was designed by Reinhold Begas. The Roman god Neptune is in the center. The four women around him represent the four main rivers of Prussia at the time the fountain was constructed: the Elbe (with the allegorical figure holding fruits and ears of corn), Rhine (fishnet and grapes), Vistula (wooden blocks, symbols of forestry), and Oder (goats and animal skins). The Vistula is now entirely in Poland, while the Oder forms the border between Germany and Poland.

The fountain was removed from its original location at the Schlossplatz in 1951, when the former Berliner Schloss (Berlin Palace) there was demolished. Eventually, after being restored, the fountain was moved in 1969 to its present location between the St Mary&#x27;s Church and the Rotes Rathaus.

The diameter is 18 m (59 ft), the height is 10 m (33 ft).

There was another well-known in Breslau (nicknamed &quot;Gabeljürge&quot; or &quot;Georgie Fork&quot; by the locals), but it was destroyed during World War II and the city was later transferred to Poland.

==Events==
In 2013, a member of the Berlin Police Force shot an armed man before the fountain. The 31-year-old man was nude, holding a knife, and was believed to be mentally disturbed.

<text>Koskenkorva Viina (also known simply as Koskenkorva or Kossu) is a traditional clear spirit drink (38%) in Finland, produced by Anora Group at the Koskenkorva distillery in Ilmajoki and bottled in Rajamäki, Nurmijärvi.

The grain (barley) alcohol is produced using 200-step continuous distillation designed to produce high-purity industrial ethanol. The drink is produced by diluting this alcohol with spring water and a very small amount of sugar. Although commonly called a vodka in English, in Finland it is not called a &quot;vodka&quot;, but &quot;viina&quot; (see brännvin), although the word &quot;vodka&quot; is found in the label due to EU regulations. Koskenkorva Vodka is the same beverage (but with 40% or 60% alcohol instead of the traditional 38%) without the added sugar, intended for foreign markets, but sold in Finland also.
Besides the standard 38% near-unflavored there are several variants of Koskenkorva on the market, most notably the famous Salmiakki Koskenkorva, better known as Salmiakkikossu or Salmari, which is salmiakki-flavored. Another variant is the same Koskenkorva with rye instead of barley, marketed under the same concept as Koskenkorva Viina Ruis. There also exists a vanilla variant called &quot;Vanilja Koskenkorva&quot;. Finlandia Vodka, a vodka classified as &quot;imported premium&quot;, is the same as Koskenkorva 40%, except that sugar is not added. Altia sold this brand, intended for foreign markets, to the American Brown-Forman Corporation, but remains the sole producer of Finlandia Vodka at least until 2017.

Koskenkorva is typically enjoyed cold, but can be also mixed with cola (commonly referred to as &quot;Kossukola&quot;), carbonated water (&quot;Kossuvissy&quot;), orange juice (&quot;screwdriver&quot;), energy drink, or certain (hard) salty liquorice candies. The latter is often made by mixing ground tyrkisk peber candies with the drink, though other similar candies are also used, and there exists a premade salmiakki mixer for this particular purpose. A similar way of enjoying &quot;kossu&quot; is by mixing ground Fisherman&#x27;s Friend lozenges to the drink; the resulting cocktail is known as &quot;Fisu&quot; (Helsinki slang for &quot;fish&quot;).

<text>Cornerstone is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Styx, released in 1979. Styx&#x27;s third straight multi-platinum selling album, &quot;Cornerstone&quot; was Styx&#x27;s first album to earn a Grammy nomination, which was for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. Like the four previous Styx albums, the band produced the album themselves. Styx recorded the album at Pumpkin Studios in Oak Lawn, Illinois.

&quot;Cornerstone&quot; is best known for including the group&#x27;s only No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 Single, the power ballad &quot;Babe&quot;. The album also includes the folk rock song &quot;Boat on the River,&quot; which was a hit in Europe, though it failed to chart in the United States.

&quot;Cornerstone&quot; became Styx&#x27;s first US Top 5 album, entering Billboard on October 13, 1979, and peaking at No. 2 in late November.

==Background==

The album represented a musical transition for Styx, as the band emphasized its pop sound more than the progressive rock influences that dominated their first eight studio albums. Peaking at #2, the album was Styx&#x27;s highest album chart peak until its successor, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot;, which hit #1.

From a songwriting standpoint, &quot;Cornerstone&quot; is dominated by Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw—each is credited as sole songwriter or co-writer for five tracks on the album (including two collaborations between the pair).

Consistent with most of Styx&#x27;s catalog from 1975 to 1983, DeYoung&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Cornerstone&quot; found the most success on the charts. The first single to be released was also to become Styx&#x27;s only US #1 single: &quot;Babe,&quot; which DeYoung wrote as a birthday present for his wife Suzanne. The track was first performed and recorded as a demo with just him and the Panozzo brothers but A&amp;M executives heard the track and insisted it go on the album. Shaw overdubbed a guitar solo in the song&#x27;s middle section.

&quot;First Time,&quot; another power ballad also written by DeYoung, was intended to be &quot;Cornerstone&quot;&#x27;s second single. Shaw, however, expressed concern that releasing two ballads in a row would alienate the band&#x27;s hard rock fan base. He felt strongly enough that he threatened to leave the band over the proposed release. The upbeat song &quot;Why Me&quot; (once again written by DeYoung) was chosen instead, reaching #26 on the charts. The division was strong enough that DeYoung was briefly fired from the band, although he was invited back before word reached the press or public. &quot;First Time&quot; did get released as a single in the Philippines.

Shaw&#x27;s major contribution to the album was the folkish &quot;Boat on the River,&quot; which became the band&#x27;s biggest European hit. Shaw&#x27;s other contributions included the pop-rocker &quot;Never Say Never,&quot; the Shaw/DeYoung album-opener &quot;Lights,&quot; the more progressively-flavored song &quot;Love in the Midnight&quot; and &quot;Borrowed Time,&quot; a DeYoung/Shaw collaboration.

James Young only had one song on the album, the hard rocker &quot;Eddie,&quot; which was aimed at left-wing politician Edward Kennedy, unsuccessfully pleading with him not to make a run for the U.S. presidency. Young used a guitar-synthesizer for the solo.

Instrumentally, the record demonstrated the shift to a more pop-oriented and organic sound. DeYoung predominantly used a Fender Rhodes electric piano on over half of the tracks and the group used real horns and strings on the album on several tracks. While commercially successful, &quot;Cornerstone&quot; brought to light the first fragmenting of the group&#x27;s collective artistic vision (DeYoung wanted to move the band more into pop while Shaw and Young both favored a rock approach). These divisions would continue to deepen, ultimately leading to Styx&#x27;s dissolution following the release of the 1983 album, Kilroy Was Here.

<text>Klein is a lunar impact crater that is located across the western rim of the larger crater Albategnius, in the central highlands region of the Moon. The crater is named after German astronomer Hermann Joseph Klein.

The rim of Klein has been worn and incised by a history of impacts, and the western rim is larger than the remainder. There are low saddles in both the northern and southern parts of the rim, and the crater Klein A cuts through the northeast rim. The floor has been covered and smoothed by a lava flow, and there is a small central peak.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Klein.

<doc id="976757" wikidata="Q498823" url="?curid=976757" title="Arethusa-class cruiser (1934)">
<text>The &quot;Arethusa&quot; class was a class of four light cruisers built for the Royal Navy between 1933 and 1937 and that served in World War II. It had been intended to construct six ships, but the last pair, &quot;Polyphemus&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot;, were ordered in 1934 as the 9,100-ton and .

== Design==
The &quot;Arethusa&quot;s were a smaller version of the &quot;Amphion&quot; group of the earlier , having the unit machinery layout and two funnels of the former. The design was judged to be the minimum required for a &quot;trade route cruiser&quot; to counter the threat of the auxiliary cruiser over which, even with their reduced armament, they would enjoy a comfortable superiority. They were also to be capable of acting as a fleet cruiser (which was fortunate because, in the end, they were used almost exclusively with the fleet). Therefore, no reduction in speed (i.e. machinery) could be accepted, and savings had to be found in armament, size and protection; the &quot;Arethusas&quot; suppressed &#x27;X&#x27; 6-inch gun turret and were shorter and displaced 1,250 tons less than the &quot;Leanders&quot;. The protection scheme was the same as the &quot;Leanders&quot; but was generally thinner to save weight. This allowed six &quot;Arethusas&quot; to be built for every five &quot;Leanders&quot; within the constraints of tonnage allowed under treaties then in force. Welded construction was widely used for the first time to save weight, over 250 tons being cut off the original specification.

They were armed with six BL 6 inch Mark XXIII in three twin mountings Mark XXI in &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; positions. Triple torpedo tubes were carried abreast the after funnel, the reduction in beam had reduced training space resulting in the omission of one tube &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the &quot;Leander&quot;s. The secondary armament was four QF 4-inch Mark V on single mountings HA Mark III, controlled by a HACS director on the bridge. The 4-inch magazine was retained in the position of the &quot;Leander&quot; class well forward, but the guns themselves were moved well aft. As a result, the 4-inch shell and charge had to be transported along the ship to reach the guns. In &quot;Penelope&quot; and &quot;Aurora&quot; eight QF 4-inch Mark XVI on four twin mountings HA/LA Mark XIX replaced the single mounts, and a second HACS director was added aft. A shelter was added for the gun crews between each pair of guns as it was recognised that in wartime the crews would spend a lot of time closed up at action stations and would rapidly fatigue in the open gun mountings. &quot;Galatea&quot; received similar alteration before the outbreak of war. The light armament consisted of eight 0.5-inch Vickers machine guns in two quadruple mountings.

A rotating catapult for a float plane and a derrick were fitted between the funnels. It had been intended to carry a second aircraft aft, but in the end this never happened. &quot;Aurora&quot; completed without aircraft facilities, and had a deckhouse for accommodation in lieu for service as commodore.

==Modifications==
&quot;Aurora&quot; received an unrotated projectile (UP) mounting and eight QF 2-pounder Mark VIII in two quadruple mountings Mark VII in the summer of 1940. Radar Type 284 was added to the main armament director for taking ranges and bearings, and Type 280 air warning at the mastheads was added in April 1941. In August of the same year she received six single 20 mm Oerlikons and two quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns. In 1943 she received Radar Type 282 on the 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom directors&quot;.

&quot;Galatea&quot; had extra plating added amidships after completion to reduce wetness and to protect the boats. She landed her catapult during a refit between October 1940 and January 1941, when she received two quadruple 2-pounders and eight single 20 mm Oerlikons, as well as Type 279 air warning radar added at the mastheads.

&quot;Arethusa&quot; had received two quadruple 2 pounders and radar by April 1941, and landed the catapult. Later the same year, two UP mountings and four single 20 mm Oerlikons were added. The former were removed in the spring of 1942, as were the single 4 in mountings (replaced by twins as per her sisters) and a further four 20 mm Oerlikons added. Radar Type 286 air warning was landed and radars Type 273 centimetric target indication, Type 281 air warning, Type 282 on the 2-pounder directors, Type 284 on the main armament director and Type 285 on the HACS directors were fitted. Three additional 20 mm Oerlikons were added by October 1942. Between March and December 1943, while under repair in the United States, the 2 pdr were supplanted by quadruple 40 mm Bofors mountings Mark II, three single Oerlikons by four twin power-operated mounts Mark V and had the radar fit modernised.

&quot;Penelope&quot; also lost her catapult and had two quadruple 2-pounders fitted between August 1940 and July 1941. Four single Oerlikons were added at the end of 1941, and four more in the summer of 1942.

By the end of the war, the surviving ships had around 700 tons of extra equipment added.

== Service ==
The &quot;Arethusa&quot;s proved to be very satisfactory in service, and their hull was adapted for the of 1937. All had a very active war, especially in the Mediterranean; the two that were lost were torpedoed while working close inshore. &quot;Arethusa&quot; had a narrow escape in November 1942 when she was hit by an air-dropped torpedo. She caught fire, had two of her three turrets out of action and was badly flooded. However, she survived to be repaired at Charleston in the United States.

<doc id="976760" wikidata="Q3895023" url="?curid=976760" title="Paradise Theatre (album)">
<text>Paradise Theatre is the tenth studio album by American rock band Styx, released on January 16, 1981, by A&amp;M Records. It was the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, peaking at #1 for three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in April and May 1981 (non-consecutively). It was also the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive album to be certified triple-platinum by the RIAA.

Four singles from the album charted on various charts, with two songs reaching the top 10 pop singles chart. The lead single &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, written by Dennis DeYoung, went to #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot;, written by Tommy Shaw, went to #9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Shaw&#x27;s only top 10 hit for Styx. &quot;Nothing Ever Goes as Planned&quot;, written by DeYoung, went to #54 on the US Pop Chart. &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Paradise&quot;—written by DeYoung, Shaw and James Young—went to #8 on the Top Rock Track Chart.

==Background==
A concept album, the album is a fictional account of Chicago&#x27;s Paradise Theatre from its opening in 1928 to its closing in 1956 (and subsequent demolition), used as a metaphor for America&#x27;s changing times from the late 1970s into the 1980s. (Dennis DeYoung, who envisioned and developed the entire concept, confirmed this in an episode of &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; about the making of the album.) 

DeYoung has said that the theme of the album is &quot;one of hope and renewal in the spirit of the American people to understand the problems that confront the world and this country and find solutions themselves to those problems. Don&#x27;t depend on heroes to do what you must do for yourself. If you hate your job but you have a dream, then pursue it. Just don&#x27;t sit around and complain about it.&quot;

&quot;Newsday&quot; critic Wayne Robins stated that the songs &quot;deal with people out of sync with themselves and their environment.&quot; For example, &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; is about a man who is unemployed and has given up, he regards &quot;Lonely People&quot; as a &quot;contemporary rewrite of the Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Eleanor Rigby,&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Nothing Ever Goes as Planned&quot; is about &quot;the inevitability of failure.&quot;

==Vinyl edition==
Initial vinyl copies of the album have a design featuring the name of the band laser-etched directly onto the vinyl on side 2 (some copies had a wax design of the cover art). The vinyl record sleeve was a gatefold and was painted by artist Chris Hopkins. On the back cover and label, the title of the record is spelled &quot;Paradise Theater&quot;, while on the front cover, the title is spelled &quot;Paradise Theatre&quot;. On the spine, the album title is &quot;Paradise&quot;. &quot;Joel Whitburn&#x27;s Top Pop Albums 1955-2001 Billboard&quot; lists the album title as &quot;Paradise Theater&quot;. 

Vinyl releases and initial CD pressings of the album had the musical segue between &quot;Half-Penny, Two-Penny&quot; and &quot;A.D. 1958&quot; indexed as the intro to &quot;A.D. 1958&quot;. Subsequent pressings of the CD had the segue indexed as the fade to &quot;Half-Penny, Two-Penny&quot; instead.

<doc id="976764" wikidata="Q6516156" url="?curid=976764" title="Leeds West Indian Carnival">
<text>The Leeds Carnival, also called the Leeds West Indian Carnival or the Chapeltown Carnival, is one of the longest running West Indian carnivals in Europe, having been going since 1967. The carnival is held in the Chapeltown and Harehills parts of Leeds every August bank holiday weekend. Attendance is estimated at 150,000.

It is a three-day event, climaxing in a carnival procession on Bank Holiday Monday, which starts and finishes in Potternewton Park in Chapeltown. A parade of floats and dancers makes its way along Harehills Avenue, down Roundhay Road in Harehills, along Barrack Road and back along Chapeltown Road to the park, where a wide range of stages and stalls provide entertainment and refreshment for carnival-goers. Since 2005 this event has been covered by BBC Radio 1Xtra in conjunction with Notting Hill Carnival.

==Carnival Queen and King==
The Carnival Queen is chosen on the Friday before the main event, and in 2008 for the first time a Carnival King was chosen: they were Davina Williams and Tyrone Henry. The 2009 King and Queen were Tony and Nicole Isles, who are father and daughter.
==History==
Its founders were Arthur France, then a Leeds University student from Nevis, who is longstanding Chairman; Ian Charles, who was still Co-ordinator in 2008; and Gertrude Paul, a teacher. Arthur France proposed what would be the first Caribbean-style outdoor carnival organized by people of Caribbean origin in Europe. As the local Caribbean association was not forthcoming, he formed his own committee, and Ian Charles&#x27;s home became a factory for costumes. Five contestants entered the first Carnival Queen Show, won by Vicky Seal as the Sun Goddess. They joined bands and dancers in a procession from Potternewton Park to Leeds Town Hall, where a steel band competition was followed by a dance. About 1,000 people attended. The Leeds performers were invited to participate in the Notting Hill Carnival later the same year.

In the 1970s a procession route was established from Potternewton Park and back again via the city centre. The steel bands were on human-powered wheeled platforms. In 1977 crowds of 10,000 were reported.

The 1980s established a shorter route around Chapeltown and Harehills, and also sponsorship by local organizations. A Carnival Prince and Princess (children aged three to 13) were also chosen. Attendance reached 40,000 in 1988.

In 1990 three people died during violence in the area afterwards. The decade saw increased professionalism by the now very experienced Carnival Committee and the introduction of lorries to carry bands. 1997 was the 30th anniversary and Arthur France received the MBE for his work with the local community.

2007 was the 40th anniversary, with crowds of 100,000 for the first time. It was also the 25th anniversary of the Leeds West Indian Centre, and the bicentenary of the British abolition of transatlantic slavery. Ian Charles also received the MBE.

In 2020 it was cancelled for the first time, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It returned in 2022.

<text>Parrot is the remains of a lunar impact crater that has been almost completely worn away. It was named after Russian doctor and physicist Friedrich Parrot. It is attached to the southern rim of the crater Albategnius, and is located among the rugged highlands among the south-central part of the visible Moon. To the east is the small crater Vogel, and in the southeast is Arzachel.

Little remains of the southwestern rim of Parrot, and the other sections of the wall have been worn and smoothed by impact erosion. The remains of a pair of overlapping craters occupy much of the northern floor of the crater, and the remainder is irregular but relatively flat. No central peak remains.

A groove structure intersects the southeast and part of the northern rim, following an intermittent line from the south-southeast to the north-northwest.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Parrot.

A concept album and rock opera about a world where rock music is outlawed, it is named after a famous World War II graffiti tag, &quot;Kilroy was here.&quot; It was the last album of original material to be released by the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young, John Panozzo, and Chuck Panozzo.

The album spawned two hit singles, the synth-pop &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; which later became one of their signature songs, and the power ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End.&quot; Both of them were major hits in 1983, peaking at No. 3 and No. 6 respectively, on the US Billboard Hot 100.

The album is certified platinum by the RIAA. It is the most recent studio album by the band to be certified platinum.

In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked the album #50 on their list of the 50 Greatest Concept Albums of All Time.

==Background==
The band created the album &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; partly to mockingly respond to Christian groups and other anti-rock-music activists who had previously influenced the Arkansas State Senate to pass a bill requiring that all records containing backmasking be labeled as such by the manufacturer. Cited in the legislation were albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, and Styx themselves. ELO similarly responded with its own 1983 album &quot;Secret Messages&quot;.

The hard rocker &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning,&quot; the fifth track on the album, begins with the backmasked Latin words &quot;annuit cœptis, novus ordo seclorum.&quot; Translated from the Latin, these words mean &quot;[he] has favored our undertakings, a new order of the ages.&quot; These are the two mottoes from the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse side of the United States one-dollar bill.

The album&#x27;s somewhat rock-operatic story tells of a future in which a fascist and theocratic government and the &quot;MMM (the Majority for Musical Morality)&quot; have outlawed rock music. The story&#x27;s protagonist, Robert Orin Charles Kilroy (DeYoung), is a former rock star who has been imprisoned by MMM leader Dr. Everett Righteous (Young). He escapes using a disguise (according to the album&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;) when he becomes aware that a young musician, Jonathan Chance (Shaw), is on a mission to bring rock music back.

Vocalist and keyboardist Dennis DeYoung conceived &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot; as an album and accompanying stage show, which opened with a short film of the same name. According to the episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot; featuring Styx, the early part of the supporting tour was a financial disaster, due to the fact that Styx had booked small, theater-sized venues for a more intimate experience, while later tour dates saw the group performing in large arenas to sold-out crowds. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 in its first week and sold over 1 million copies (although some sources say 2.5 million copies) and peaked at No. 3 on the US charts; however, it broke the streak of multi-platinum albums for Styx, and ushered in a more keyboard-oriented, theatrical direction.

In an interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, James Young talked about the creative differences in the band, and what led to their breakup: &quot;Dennis really wanted to do these soft, intimate love ballads, and that was against the grain for me and Tommy Shaw, so our differences got magnified, because Dennis was insisting on going outside the boundaries we lived with. He&#x27;s an assertive and strongly opinionated guy.&quot;

Despite the album&#x27;s financial and chart success, after the &quot;Kilroy&quot; tour, the songs were not performed live by the band Styx (who fired DeYoung in 1999) in subsequent tours (with the exception of segments from &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning&quot; performed in the &quot;Cyclo-medley&quot;), until &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; reappeared in full (in their encore) on May 30, 2018. DeYoung does perform the songs &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End&quot; regularly during his solo tours. The James Young Group performed &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning&quot; and &quot;Double Life&quot; as well on their tour in 1993.

==Music video==
Three of the four videos for the album, &quot;Mr. Roboto,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End,&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Poisoning,&quot; were filmed at the same time and used footage from the minifilm. A fourth video, &quot;Haven&#x27;t We Been Here Before,&quot; was filmed a few months after the album was released; it did not interact with the album&#x27;s story.

<text>Vogel is a small lunar impact crater located to the southeast of Albategnius. It was named after the German astronomer Hermann Carl Vogel. It is the smallest member of a trio of craters that increase in size from north to south, consisting of Vogel, Argelander and Airy. To the west is the remnant of the crater Parrot.

Both the northern and southern ends of Vogel&#x27;s rim are interrupted by smaller craters. Vogel B to the north is overlain in turn along its northern rim by an even smaller crater, thus forming a cluster of interconnected craters with Vogel being the largest. The rim of Vogel is otherwise relatively intact and not significantly worn.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vogel.

<doc id="976782" wikidata="Q1002613" url="?curid=976782" title="Mean longitude">
<text>Mean longitude is the ecliptic longitude at which an orbiting body could be found if its orbit were circular and free of perturbations. While nominally a simple longitude, in practice the mean longitude does not correspond to any one physical angle.

==Definition==

* Define a reference direction, ♈︎, along the ecliptic. Typically, this is the direction of the March equinox. At this point, ecliptic longitude is 0°. 
* The body&#x27;s orbit is generally inclined to the ecliptic, therefore define the angular distance from ♈︎ to the place where the orbit crosses the ecliptic from south to north as the &quot;longitude of the ascending node&quot;, . 
* Define the angular distance along the plane of the orbit from the ascending node to the pericenter as the &quot;argument of periapsis,&quot; .
* Define the &quot;mean anomaly&quot;, , as the angular distance from the periapsis which the body would have if it moved in a circular orbit, in the same orbital period as the actual body in its elliptical orbit.
From these definitions, the &quot;mean longitude&quot;, , is the angular distance the body would have from the reference direction if it moved with uniform speed,
:formula_1,
measured along the ecliptic from ♈︎ to the ascending node, then up along the plane of the body&#x27;s orbit to its mean position.

Sometimes the value defined in this way is called the &quot;mean mean longitude&quot;, and the term &quot;mean longitude&quot; is used for a value that does have short-term variations (such as over a synodic month or a year in the case of the moon) but does not include the correction due to the difference between true anomaly and mean anomaly.
Also, sometimes the mean longitude (or mean mean longitude) is considered to be a slowly varying function, modeled with a Maclaurin series, rather than a simple linear function of time.

The true longitude is a separate value that corresponds to the actual angular distance from the reference direction, taking into account the varying speed and non-circular shape of the orbit. It is the analogue to the true anomaly, which is measured relative to periapsis like the mean anomaly.

==Discussion==

Mean longitude, like mean anomaly, does not measure an angle between any physical objects. It is simply a convenient uniform measure of how far around its orbit a body has progressed since passing the reference direction. While mean longitude measures a mean position and assumes constant speed, true longitude measures the actual longitude and assumes the body has moved with its actual speed, which varies around its elliptical orbit. The difference between the two is known as the equation of the center.

==Formulae==
From the above definitions, define the &quot;longitude of periapsis&quot;
:formula_2.
Then mean longitude is also
:&quot;formula_3&quot;.

Another form often seen is the &quot;mean longitude at epoch&quot;, . This is simply the mean longitude at a reference time , known as the epoch. Mean longitude can then be expressed,
:formula_4, or
:formula_5, if is measured relative to the epoch .
where &quot;n&quot; is the &quot;mean angular motion&quot; and &quot;t&quot; is any arbitrary time. In some sets of orbital elements, &quot;ε&quot; is one of the six elements.

<doc id="976783" wikidata="Q1016777" url="?curid=976783" title="Burnham (crater)">
<text>Burnham is a small crater located to the southeast of the crater Albategnius, in a relatively smooth area of the lunar surface. It was named after American astronomer Sherburne W. Burnham. To the southwest is Vogel.

The irregular tooth-like shape of the rim of Burnham protrudes to the southwest, giving the wall a distorted, asymmetric appearance. There are breaks in the rim to the northwest and southwest, the later forming a valley running about 15 km. The interior floor is rough and irregular, and lacks anything resembling a central peak. The abundance of small hills covering the crater floor from rim to rim makes it unusual.

<text>Ritchey is a small lunar impact crater named after the American astronomer George Willis Ritchey. The crater is situated to the east of Albategnius in the central lunar highlands. Its somewhat angular rim is broken along the northwestern wall by a pair of smaller, adjacent craters. The floor of Ritchey is fairly flat, with a pair of small central mounds.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the satellite midpoint that is closest to Ritchey.

<text>In homotopy theory (a branch of mathematics), the Whitehead theorem states that if a continuous mapping &quot;f&quot; between CW complexes &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, then &quot;f&quot; is a homotopy equivalence. This result was proved by J. H. C. Whitehead in two landmark papers from 1949, and provides a justification for working with the concept of a CW complex that he introduced there. It is a model result of algebraic topology, in which the behavior of certain algebraic invariants (in this case, homotopy groups) determines a topological property of a mapping.

== Statement ==

In more detail, let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be topological spaces. Given a continuous mapping

:formula_1

and a point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, consider for any &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0 the induced homomorphism

:formula_2

where π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) denotes the &quot;n&quot;-th homotopy group of &quot;X&quot; with base point &quot;x&quot;. (For &quot;n&quot; = 0, π0(&quot;X&quot;) just means the set of path components of &quot;X&quot;.) A map &quot;f&quot; is a weak homotopy equivalence if the function

:formula_3

is bijective, and the homomorphisms formula_4 are bijective for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. (For &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; path-connected, the first condition is automatic, and it suffices to state the second condition for a single point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.) The Whitehead theorem states that a weak homotopy equivalence from one CW complex to another is a homotopy equivalence. (That is, the map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; has a homotopy inverse &quot;g&quot;: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, which is not at all clear from the assumptions.) This implies the same conclusion for spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes.

Combining this with the Hurewicz theorem yields a useful corollary: a continuous map formula_1 between simply connected CW complexes that induces an isomorphism on all integral homology groups is a homotopy equivalence.

== Spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may not be homotopy equivalent ==

A word of caution: it is not enough to assume π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is isomorphic to π&quot;n&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) for each &quot;n&quot; in order to conclude that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are homotopy equivalent. One really needs a map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; inducing an isomorphism on homotopy groups. For instance, take &quot;X&quot;= &quot;S&quot;2 × RP3 and &quot;Y&quot;= RP2 × &quot;S&quot;3. Then &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; have the same fundamental group, namely the cyclic group Z/2, and the same universal cover, namely &quot;S&quot;2 × &quot;S&quot;3; thus, they have isomorphic homotopy groups. On the other hand their homology groups are different (as can be seen from the Künneth formula); thus, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are not homotopy equivalent. 

The Whitehead theorem does not hold for general topological spaces or even for all subspaces of Rn. For example, the Warsaw circle, a compact subset of the plane, has all homotopy groups zero, but the map from the Warsaw circle to a single point is not a homotopy equivalence. The study of possible generalizations of Whitehead&#x27;s theorem to more general spaces is part of the subject of shape theory.

== Generalization to model categories ==
In any model category, a weak equivalence between cofibrant-fibrant objects is a homotopy equivalence.

<text>Fausto Paolo Sozzini (; ; 5 December 1539 – 4 March 1604), often known in English by his Latinized name Faustus Socinus ( ), was an Italian Renaissance humanist and theologian, and, alongside his uncle Lelio Sozzini, founder of the Nontrinitarian Christian belief system known as Socinianism. His doctrine was developed among the Polish Brethren in the Polish Reformed Church between the 16th and 17th centuries, and embraced by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania during the same period.

Fausto Sozzini recollected most of his uncle Lelio&#x27;s religious writings by traveling over again his routes throughout early modern Europe, and systematized his Antitrinitarian beliefs into a coherent theological doctrine. His polemical treatise &quot;De sacrae Scripturae auctoritate&quot; (written in the years 1580s and published in England in 1732, with the title &quot;A demonstration of the truth of the Christian religion, from the Latin of Socinius&quot;) was highly influential on Remonstrant thinkers such as Simon Episcopius, who drew on Sozzini&#x27;s arguments for viewing the sacred scriptures as historical texts.

==Life==
Sozzini was born in Siena, capital city of the Republic of Siena, at the time under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the only son of Alessandro Sozzini and Agnese Petrucci, daughter of Borghese Petrucci (born in 1490), and granddaughter of Pandolfo Petrucci.

His father Alessandro Sozzini, the oldest of eleven brothers, was born in 1509 but died in 1541, in his thirty-second year. Fausto had no regular education, being brought up at home with his sister Fillide, and spent his youth in desultory reading at Borgo Scopeto, the family&#x27;s country-seat. To the able women of his family he owed the strong moral impress which marked him through life; his early intellectual stimulus came from his uncle Celso Sozzini, a nominal Catholic, but an &quot;esprit fort&quot;, founder of the short-lived &quot;Accademia del Sizienti&quot; (1554), of which young Fausto was a member.

In 1556 his grandfather Mariano Sozzini the younger&#x27;s will, left Fausto, as only son of the oldest son, one fourth of the family estates, which made him independent. Next year he entered the &quot;Accademia degli Intronati&quot;, the centre of intellectual life in Siena. He joined with the name &quot;Frastagliato&quot;, while Celso had the name &quot;Sonnacchioso&quot;. About this time the jurist Guido Panciroli describes him as a young man of fine talent, with promise of a legal career; but he showed little interest for law, preferring to write sonnets.

In 1558–1559 the suspicion of Lutheranism fell on him in common with his uncles Celso and Camillo.

===Lyons and Geneva===
Coming of age (1561) he went to Lyon, probably engaging in mercantile business; he revisited Italy after his uncle Lelio Sozzini&#x27;s death; we find him in 1562 on the roll of the Italian church at Geneva; there is no trace of any relations with Calvin. He returned next year to Lyon. The evangelical position was not radical enough for him. In his &quot;Brevis explicatio&quot; (Lyons, 1562) of the prologue to St John&#x27;s Gospel he already attributes to Christ an official, not an essential, deity – already an anti-Trinitarian position; and in a letter of 1563 rejects the immortality of the soul in favour of Christian mortalism; a position subsequently developed in his disputation with the humanist Francesco Pucci.

===Florence===
Towards the end of 1563 he returned to Italy, conforming to the Roman Catholic Church, and for twelve years, as, his unpublished letters show, was in the service of noblewoman Isabella de&#x27; Medici, daughter of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (not, as Samuel Przypkowski says, in the service of the Grand Duke himself). Between 1565 and 1568 he wrote the essay &quot;Il Frastagliato Intronato&quot;. This portion of his life he regarded as wasted; until 1567 he gave some attention to legal duties, and wrote (1570) his treatise &quot;De auctoritate s. scripturae&quot;.

In 1571 he was in Rome, probably with his patroness. He left Italy at the end of 1575, and after Isabella&#x27;s death (allegedly strangled by her husband in 1576) and declined the overtures of her brother Francesco, now grand-duke, who pressed him to return. Francesco was doubtless aware of the motive which led Sozzini to quit Italy; there is every reason to believe Samuel Przypkowski&#x27;s statement that the grand-duke agreed to secure to him the income of his property so long as he published nothing in his own name.

===Basel===
Sozzini now fixed himself at Basel, gave himself to close study of the Bible, began translating the Psalms into Italian verse, and, in spite of increasing deafness, became a centre of theological debates. His discussion with Jacques Couet on the doctrine of salvation issued in a treatise &quot;De Jesu Christo servatore&quot; (finished 12 July 1578), the circulation of which in manuscript commended him to the notice of Giorgio Biandrata, court physician in Poland and Transylvania, and ecclesiastical wire puller in the interests of heterodoxy.

===Transylvania===
Transylvania for a short time (1559–1571) enjoyed full religious liberty under the first unitarian prince, John Sigismund. 
The current existing ruler, Christopher Bathory, favoured the Jesuits; it was now Biandrata&#x27;s object to limit the Judaic tendencies of the eloquent anti-Trinitarian bishop, Ferenc Dávid (1510–1579), with whom he had previously co-operated. A charge of the gravest sort against Biandrata&#x27;s morals had destroyed his influence with David. Hence he called in Sozzini to reason with Dávid, who had renounced the worship of Christ. In Sozzini&#x27;s scheme of doctrine, terms in themselves orthodox were employed in a heretical sense.

In matter of worship Sozzini distinguished between &quot;adoratio Christi&quot;, the homage of the heart, imperative on all Christians, and &quot;invocatio Christi&quot;, the direct address of prayer, which was simply permissive (Biandrata would have made it imperative); though in Sozzini&#x27;s view, prayer, to whomsoever addressed, was received by Christ as mediator, for transmission to the father.

In November 1578 Sozzini reached Kolozsvár from Poland, and did his best, during a visit of four months and a half under Dávid&#x27;s roof, to argue him into this modified doctrine of invocation. The upshot was that Dávid exerted all his powers in denouncing all &quot;cultus&quot; of Christ from the pulpit. Dávid&#x27;s civil trial followed, on a charge of innovation. Sozzini hurried back to Poland before it began. He cannot be accused of complicity with the actions of Biandrata; he was no party to David&#x27;s incarceration at the Fortress of Déva, where the old man miserably perished in less than three months. He was willing that Dávid should be prohibited from preaching pending the decision of a general synod; and his references to the case show that (as in the later instances of Jacobus Palaeologus, Christian Franken and Martin Seidel) theological aversions, though they never made him uncivil, froze up his native kindness and blinded his perceptions of character.

Biandrata ultimately conformed to the Catholic Church; hence Sozzini&#x27;s laudatory dedication to him (1584) of his &quot;De Jesu Christi natura&quot;, in reply to the Calvinist Andrew Wolan, though printed in his works, was not used.

===Poland===
The remainder (1579–1604) of Sozzini&#x27;s life was spent in Poland. Excluded at first by his views on baptism (which he regarded as applicable only to Gentile converts) from the &quot;Ecclesia Minor&quot; or anti-Trinitarian Church (largely anabaptist), he acquired by degrees a predominant influence in its synods.

He was asked by the Polish Brethren to take up the position of a champion of conscientious objection against the Belarusian Symon Budny and the Greek Unitarian Jacobus Palaeologus after Gregory Pauli of Brzeziny had become indisposed, and thereby gained some respect among the Poles.

Fausto Sozzini converted the Arian section of the &quot;Ecclesia Minor&quot; from belief in the pre-existence of Christ to the early Unitarian position, and from their rejection of the &quot;invocatio Christi.&quot; He repressed the semi-Judaizers whom he failed to convince. Through correspondence with friends he influenced also the policy of the anti-Trinitarian Church of Transylvania.

Forced to leave Kraków in 1583, he found a home with a Polish noble, Christopher Morsztyn, whose daughter Elizabeth he married (1586). She died in the following year, a few months after the birth of a daughter, Agnese (1587–1654), afterwards the wife of Stanisław Wiszowaty, father of Andreas Wiszowaty, and the progenitress of numerous descendants. In 1587 the grand-duke Francesco died; to this event Sozzini&#x27;s biographers attribute the loss of his Italian property, but his unpublished letters show that he was on good terms with the new grand-duke, Ferdinando. Family disputes had arisen respecting the interpretation of his grandfather&#x27;s will; in October 1590 the holy office at Siena disinherited him, allowing him a pension, apparently never paid.

The end of financial remittances from his property in Italy dissolved the agreement under which his writings were to remain anonymous, and Sozzini began to publish in his own name. The consequence was that in 1598 a mob expelled him from Kraków, wrecking his house, and beating him. Friends gave him a ready welcome at Luslawice, 30 miles east from Kraków; and here, having long been &quot;troubled with colic and the stone&quot;, he died on 4 March 1604. A limestone block with illegible inscriptions marks his grave. His engraved portrait is prefixed to his works (the original is not extant); an oil painting, formerly at Siena, cannot be considered authentic.

==Works==
Sozzini&#x27;s works, edited by his grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty and the learned printer Frans Kuyper, are contained in two closely printed folios (Amsterdam, 1668). They rank as the first two volumes of the &quot;Bibliotheca fratrum polonorum&quot; though the works of Johann Crell and Jonas Schlichting were the first of the series to be printed. They include all Sozzini&#x27;s extant theological writings, except his essay on predestination (in which he denies that God foresees the actions of free agents) prefixed to Castellio&#x27;s &quot;Dialogi IV&quot; (1575, reprinted 1613) and his revision of a school manual &quot;Instrumentum doctrinarum aristotelium&quot; (1586).

His pseudonyms, easily interpreted, were Felix Turpio Urhevetanus, Prosper Dysidaeus, Gratianus Prosper and Gratianus Turpio Gerapolensis (Senensis). Some of his early verse is in &quot;Ferentillis Scielta di stanze di diversi autori toscani&quot; (1579, 1594); other specimens are given in Cant and in the Athenaeum (Aug. II, 1877); more are preserved at Siena.

Sozzini considered that his ablest work was his &quot;Contra atheos&quot;, which perished in the riot at Kraków (1598). Later he began, but left incomplete, more than one work designed to exhibit his system as a whole.

His reputation as a thinker must rest upon the &quot;De auctoritate scripturae sacrae&quot; (1570) and &quot;De Jesu Christo servatore&quot; (1578). The former was first published (Seville [London, John Wolfe], 1588) by López, a Jesuit, who claimed it as his own, but prefixed a preface maintaining (contrary to a fundamental position of Sozzini) that man by nature has a knowledge of God. A French version (1592) was approved by the ministers of Basel; the English translation by Rev. Edward Coombe (Somerset 1731) was undertaken in consequence of the commendation in a charge (1728) by Bishop Richard Smalbroke, who observes that Grotius had borrowed from it in his &quot;De veritate Christ. rel.&quot;. In small compass it anticipates the historical argument of the credibility writers; in trying it by modern tests, it should be remembered that Sozzini, regarding it (1581) as not adequately meeting the cardinal difficulties attending the proof of the Christian religion, began to reconstruct its positions in his &quot;Lectiones sacrae&quot; (unfinished). His treatise on the Saviour renders a real service to theology, placing orthodoxy and heresy in new relations of fundamental antagonism, and narrowing the conflict to the main personal benefit of religion.

Of the person of Christ in this treatise he says nothing; its one topic is the work of Christ, which in his view operates upon man alone; the theological sagacity of Sozzini may be measured by the persistency with which this idea tends to recur. Though his name has been attached to a school of opinion, he disclaimed the rôle of a heresiarch, and declined to give his unreserved adhesion to any one sect. His confidence in the conclusions of his own mind has earned him the repute of a dogmatist; but it was his constant aim to reduce and simplify the fundamentals of Christianity. Not without some ground does the memorial tablet at Siena (inscription by prof. Giovanni Brigidi 1879) characterize him as vindicator of human reason against the supernatural.

Of his non-theological doctrines the most important is his assertion of the unlawfulness not only of war, but of the taking of human life in any circumstances. Hence the comparative mildness of his proposals for dealing with religious and anti-religious offenders, though it cannot be said that he had grasped the complete theory of toleration. Hence, too, his contention that magisterial office is unlawful for a Christian.

<doc id="976801" wikidata="Q1208927" url="?curid=976801" title="Autonomous administrative divisions of China">
<text>Chinese autonomous administrative divisions are associated with one or more ethnic minorities that are designated as autonomous within the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These areas are recognized in the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and are nominally given a number of rights not accorded to other administrative divisions of China. For example, Tibetan minorities in autonomous regions are granted rights and support not given to the Han Chinese, such as fiscal and medical subsidies.

== Autonomous administrative divisions ==
The PRC&#x27;s autonomous administrative divisions may be found in the first (or top) to third levels of its national administrative divisions thus:


==Ethnic area==
Although not named as autonomous areas, some third-level settlements and areas that are identified as county-level cities and county-level districts enjoy the same autonomy as autonomous areas. At the fourth (&quot;township&quot;) level, 1 ethnic sum (the Evenk Ethnic Sum) and over 270 ethnic townships also exist, but are not considered to be autonomous and do not enjoy the laws pertaining to the larger ethnic autonomous areas.

As these autonomous areas were created by the PRC, they are not recognised by the Republic of China on Taiwan which ruled Mainland China before the PRC&#x27;s creation. However, in 2001, the ROC designated the Taiwanese indigenous areas in southern parts of the island.

== Nomenclature ==
The names of most of the PRC&#x27;s autonomous areas are made from linking together:
* the name of a geographical area;
* the name or names of the predominant ethnic minority or minorities;
* the word &quot;autonomous&quot;; and
* a type of administrative division.
For instance:
In the Chinese name of the administrative area, the nationality name always includes the suffix &quot;&quot; (&quot;nationality&quot;), unless the nationality name consists of more than two syllables (&quot;e.g.&quot; Xinjiang Uyghur/Wéiwú&#x27;ěr AR) or the geographical name contains the nationality name (&quot;e.g.&quot; Inner Mongolia and Tibet ARs). This distinction is not reflected in translation into English.

Some autonomous areas have more than one specified minority, which tend to be listed in the name of the prefecture, creating rather long names. Two autonomous counties simply use &quot;various nationalities&quot; in their names as placeholders, rather than listing out all of their designated ethnicities:

A few autonomous areas break the regular nomenclature pattern, because the name of the nationality is already contained within the geographical name, or because there is no geographical name:

== Legal basis ==

Autonomous regions, prefectures, counties, and banners are covered under Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 111–122) of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and with more detail under the Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Regional National Autonomy (). The constitution states that the head of government of each autonomous areas must be of the ethnic group as specified by the autonomous area (such as Tibetan or Uyghur). The constitution also guarantees a range of rights including: independence of finance, independence of economic planning, independence of arts, science and culture, organization of local police, and use of local language. In addition, the head of government of each autonomous region is known as a &quot;chairman&quot;, unlike provinces, where they are known as &quot;governors&quot;.

== Demographics ==
Of the five autonomous regions, only Tibet has an absolute majority (&gt;50%) of the designated ethnic group, since Tibetans make up 90% of the population as of 2011. Xinjiang is more ethnically diverse, with the titular Uyghurs making up a plurality at 46%, Han making up 39%, and various other ethnic groups making up the remaining 15% as of 2015. The remaining three autonomous regions have absolute majorities of Han people, the most populous ethnic group in China.

== History ==
Autonomous regions, prefectures, counties, and banners were established after communist takeover, following Soviet practice. At first, the nomenclature of these autonomous areas were somewhat confused, with autonomous regions appearing at the province, prefecture, county, and township levels. Eventually the nomenclature was standardized to the conventions used today.

The first autonomous region to be established was Inner Mongolia, created within communist-held territory in 1947, two years before the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic. Xinjiang was converted from a province to an autonomous region in 1955. Guangxi and Ningxia followed in 1958, and the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established in 1965.

<text>The autonomous regions () are one of four types of province-level divisions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Like Chinese provinces, an autonomous region has its own local government, but under the law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, an autonomous region has more legislative rights, such as the right to &quot;formulate self-government regulations and other separate regulations.&quot; An autonomous region is the highest level of minority autonomous entity in China, which has a comparably higher population of a particular minority ethnic group. 

There are five autonomous regions in China: Guangxi, Inner Mongolia (Nei Menggu), Ningxia, Tibet (Xizang), and Xinjiang.

==History==
Established in 1947, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region became the first autonomous region in the Chinese liberated zone. Xinjiang was made autonomous in 1955 after the PRC&#x27;s founding, and Guangxi and Ningxia were made autonomous in 1958. Tibet was annexed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1951, and was declared an autonomous region in 1965. The designation of Guangxi and Ningxia as Zhuang and Hui autonomous areas, respectively, was protested by the local Han Chinese, who made up two-thirds of the population of each region. Although Mongols made up an even smaller percentage of Inner Mongolia than either of these, the ensuing Chinese Civil War gave little opportunity for protest.

==Legal rights==
Autonomous regions in China have no legal right to secede, unlike in the Soviet Union – the &quot;Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on Regional Ethnic Autonomy&quot;, written in 1984, states that &quot;each and every ethnic autonomous region is an inseparable part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China,&quot; and that &quot;any form of... separatism... is absolutely prohibited.&quot;

== Public goods and services ==
In general, China&#x27;s minority regions have some of the highest per capita government spending on education, among other public goods and services. Providing public goods and services in these areas is part of a government effort to reduce regional inequalities, reduce the risk of separatism, and stimulate economic development.

<doc id="976820" wikidata="Q5092942" url="?curid=976820" title="Cheshire Constabulary">
<text>Cheshire Constabulary is the territorial police force responsible for policing the ceremonial county of Cheshire in North West England, comprising the unitary authorities of Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Borough of Halton and Borough of Warrington. The force is responsible for policing an area of with a population of approximately 1 million people.

Chief Constable Mark Roberts was appointed in 2021. The deputy chief constable is Chris Armitt, appointed in September 2021.

==History==
A constabulary was first formed in the county under the &#x27; (10 Geo. 4. xcvii) which was amended by the &#x27; (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. xxxi). The passage of the County and Borough Police Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 69) led to the dissolution of this force and the creation of a second constabulary. Many of the officers continued to serve in the new force and there were clauses in the act which allowed their pension rights to continue.

The first chief constable was Captain Thomas Johnnes Smith, late of the Bedfordshire Militia. The first full Cheshire Police Committee met at the Crewe Arms Hotel, Crewe, on 3 February 1857 and the new Cheshire Constabulary was officially formed on 20 April 1857.

The first headquarters was established at 4 Seller Street, Chester. In 1862 this office was removed to 1 Egerton Street, Chester and remained there until 1870, when it was removed to 113 Foregate Street. In 1893, the Court of Quarter Sessions approved the building of a new Headquarters which was erected at 142 Foregate Street and designed by John Douglas, at a cost not exceeding £2,000. This continued to be used, together with the adjoining buildings, until 1967, when a new purpose-built Headquarters was opened at Nuns Road, Chester. This building served the constabulary until 2004 when the Headquarters building moved to a purpose-built complex at Clemonds Hey, Winsford. In 1965, the force had an establishment of 1,359 and an actual strength of 1,329.

It was proposed by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, that Cheshire should merge with the Merseyside Police, to form a strategic police force, but these proposals were later abandoned.

The Museum of Policing in Cheshire preserves and researches the heritage of policing in the county.

In June 2022, Cheshire Police announced that they will start using facial recognition technology in a bid to help identify offenders. The Technology will be used retrospectively to compare images such as CCTV against pictures held on the police national database.

==Governance==
The incumbent Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) is Dan Price, appointed in May 2024. The PCC is scrutinised by the Cheshire Police and Crime Panel, made up of elected councillors from the local authorities in the police area. Before November 2012, the force was governed by the Cheshire Police Authority.

===Chief constables===

The force has had a number of chief constables:
* Captain Thomas Johnes Smith (1857 to 1870) (First Chief Constable of Cheshire)
* Captain John William Arrowsmith (1870 to 1881)
* Colonel John Henry Hamersley (1881–1910)

===Officers killed in the line of duty===

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

Since 1788, the following officers of Cheshire Constabulary, or its predecessor organisations, were killed while attempting to prevent, stop or resolve a crime:
*Officer John Parry, 1788 (killed arresting a suspect on warrant).
*Police Constable Charles Alfred Cartledge, 1894 (fatally injured stopping a disturbance).
*Police Constable Alfred Kerns, 1900 (fatally injured during a struggle with two men).

==Organisation==

The constabulary covers the council areas of Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington.
In 2015, the structure of the force was changed to cover nine Local Policing Units (LPUs) across the county.
* Chester 
* Crewe 
* Ellesmere Port 
* Macclesfield 
* Congleton
* Northwich
* Warrington

*Runcorn 
* Warrington
* Widnes

===Basic command unit structure===
Each area has several specialist teams, namely:

* Local Policing Units, each with local neighbourhood policing teams and investigation teams. The units concentrate on responding to both emergency and non-emergency calls, preventing and detecting local crime and targeting offenders, building contacts in the local community, resolving problems by working with local organisations and individuals, and being visible and accessible.
* Criminal Investigation Departments detect serious crime
* Customer Service Desks ensure incidents are dealt with promptly and the public get a better service
* Public Protection Units deal with domestic abuse, stalking and harassment, honour-based violence, elder abuse and child protection.
* Intelligence Units and Pro-active Policing Units target persistent criminals
* Partnership Development Units
* Custody Investigation Teams, consist of a combination of interviewing police officers and civilian staff members who interview persons detained in the custody suite suspected of committing an offence.

=== Headquarters-based teams ===
The following centralised teams operate from force headquarters:

* Central Roads Policing Unit
* Centralised Crime Recording Bureau
* Contingency Planning/Events Coordinators
* Force Major Investigation Team
* Specialised Support Units

===Road policing===
The Cheshire road system is made up of of highway. The constabulary is responsible for policing one of the longest stretches of motorway in Britain. The force patrols of the M6, M62, M53 and M56 motorways, which has 23 interchanges and four service areas. The M6 motorway across the Thelwall Viaduct carries 140,000 vehicles every 24 hours. Delays and incidents on the motorway can have a severe impact on the economic life of the entire North West Region.

===Air operations unit===
The force no longer has an air operations unit. Since 2012 aviation support has been provided by the National Police Air Service.

Historically, in December 2001, Cheshire Police began operating a Britten-Norman Islander fixed-wing aircraft. It was particularly suited to police aviation as it was able to carry a wide range of equipment and stay airborne for long periods of time. This equipment allowed it to operate during the day or night, in most weather conditions.

On 27 February 2009, the Constabulary confirmed that the Home Office had agreed to jointly fund the purchase of a new £1million Eurocopter EC135 aircraft, to be operational 24 hours a day. The fixed-wing aircraft was retired when the new helicopter came into operation.

The aircraft was operated by a team of civilian pilots, four police observers and one sergeant ensure it was available all year. The aircraft was used to conduct a wide range of policing work providing emergency responses to incidents involving threat to life, commission of crime and searching for missing persons. It also conducted deployments for non-crime searches, scene management at incidents and video evidence gathering.

On 18 July 2011, the North West Air Operations Group was launched. It was a regional collaboration between five forces and police authorities. The service dispatched aircraft from a regional command desk to incidents across Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and North Wales.
The five forces in the North had four helicopters, based at four different locations throughout the North West, providing a service anywhere in the region, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

==Race and sex discrimination in recruitment==
In February 2019, Cheshire Constabulary was found guilty of discrimination, having refused to give an applicant a job because he was a white heterosexual man. Despite the applicant, university graduate Matthew Furlong, being judged to have been &quot;well prepared&quot;, he was nevertheless rejected for the job with the force falsely claiming that 127 of the other candidates had been equally suitable for the role, a claim an employment tribunal described as a &quot;fallacy&quot;. The tribunal was told that Acting Chief Constable Janette McCormick believed &quot;passionately about positive action&quot; and it ruled that Furlong had been a victim of direct discrimination on the grounds of his sexual orientation, with the case believed to be the first in the UK of an organisation misusing positive action to discriminate illegally.

==Collaborations==
Cheshire Constabulary is a partner in the following collaborations:
* Alliance Armed Policing Unit (Cheshire and North Wales)
* Cheshire and North Wales Police Dogs
* North West Police Underwater Search &amp; Marine Unit
* North West Motorway Police Group
* Safer Schools &amp; Young People&#x27;s Partnerships

==Crime statistics==

Between 2005 and 2007, Cheshire Constabulary&#x27;s crime statistics for recorded crimes were:

==PEEL inspection==
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Cheshire Constabulary was rated as follows:

==Cheshire Constabulary and the media==
During 2005/06, the force was featured in the BBC TV series &quot;Traffic Cops&quot;.

Former Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy called for the legal age of buying alcohol to increase to the age of 21 as a result of the Garry Newlove murder in 2007.

Series 3 of &quot;999: What&#x27;s Your Emergency?&quot;, which aired in mid 2016, followed officers from Cheshire Constabulary alongside Ambulance crews from the North West Ambulance Service.

During 2017, Cheshire Constabulary was featured in series 12 of Channel 5&#x27; TV programme &quot;Police Interceptors&quot;.

In early 2019, a ten-part series focusing on the work of Cheshire Police&#x27;s Vehicle Maintenance Unit aired on the TV channel Dave.

In 2021 a new spin off of the show Motorway cops started following the roads and crime team in the series Motorway Cops:Catching Britain&#x27;s speeders again for a Channel 5&#x27;s commission,

<doc id="976822" wikidata="Q2555665" url="?curid=976822" title="HMS Arethusa (26)">
<text>HMS &quot;Arethusa&quot; was the name ship of her class of light cruisers built for the Royal Navy. She was built by Chatham Dockyard, with the keel being laid down on 25 January 1933. She was launched on 6 March 1934, and commissioned 21 May 1935 by Captain Philip Vian.

==History==

&quot;Arethusa&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean on completion and was still there at the onset of World War II in September 1939. However, early in 1940 she and her sister were recalled to the Home Fleet, where they formed the 2nd Cruiser Squadron with the remainder of the class. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940, but on 8 May she joined the Nore Command, where she supported the defending forces in Calais and later aided the evacuations from French Atlantic ports.

On 28 June 1940 she was a component of the newly formed Force &quot;H&quot; at Gibraltar, with which she participated in the action against Vichy French forces at Mers el Kebir in July 1940. With Force &quot;H&quot; she took part in convoy protection patrols in the Atlantic and operated in the Mediterranean.

During the sortie of the in May 1941 she was employed in Iceland and Faroes waters, but by July she had returned to the Mediterranean, where she escorted Malta convoys and herself ran supply trips to the island. Towards the end of 1941 she returned to home waters and took part in the Lofoten raid in December, where she was damaged by near misses. After refit and repair at Chatham until April 1942, she returned to the Mediterranean in June 1942, where she joined the 15th Cruiser Squadron, operating mostly in support of the resupply of Malta.
While on Operation Stoneage, a torpedo from an Italian aircraft struck &quot;Arethusa&quot; on 18 November 1942 and caused heavy casualties. She received temporary repair work in Alexandria that lasted until 7 February 1943, after which she proceeded to Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina, United States, for full repair. These were completed by 15 December 1943, and the ship then returned to Britain.

In 1941 &quot;Arethusa&quot; had been adopted by the people of the City of Swansea. A memorial relief to the 156 men killed in the November 1942 aircraft attack can still be viewed in the city&#x27;s Maritime Quarter. Swansea Museum&#x27;s reserve collection at its Landore facility contains the ship&#x27;s badge, a 20mm Oerlikon AA gun salvaged from the Newport scrapyard, and a scale model of the ship.

She did not become fully operational again until early June 1944, when she sailed for the invasion of Normandy, forming part of Force &quot;D&quot; off Sword Beach. She had the honor of carrying King George VI across the channel to Normandy, when he toured the beaches and visited the Allied command headquarters.
On 24 June she came under air attack in Seine Bay and sustained some damage.
On 25 June a magnetic mine detonated in her wake. The shock damage was fairly extensive, the cruiser went to Portsmouth for repairs then to a commercial yard for yet another refit and did not return to service until September.

By January 1945, she was part of the 15th Cruiser Squadron with the Mediterranean Fleet and stayed there until October 1945 when she returned to the United Kingdom and was immediately placed in the reserve (at the Nore).

There was a tentative plan to sell her to the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1946 but this came to nothing and she was placed in category &#x27;B&#x27; reserve. Because the Navy considered her class of ships too small to be worth modernising, the Navy used &quot;Arethusa&quot; for trials and experiments in 1949 before allocating her to BISCO for disposal. On 9 May 1950, she arrived at Cashmore&#x27;s, Newport, for breaking up.

<text>Jansen is a lunar impact crater in the north part of the Mare Tranquillitatis. The diameter is 24 km. It was named after 17th century Dutch optician Zacharias Janssen. It is located to the east-southeast of the crater Plinius. The rim of Jansen is low and narrow, with a notch along the western edge. The interior is relatively level, which may indicate it has been covered by lava. To the south-southwest a small but prominent crater lies on the crater floor, halfway between the center and the rim.

To the northwest of the rim is a rille named Rima Jansen, and to the east are wrinkle ridges in the mare surface. A low ridge runs from near the southeast rim in a southeasterly direction.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Jansen.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Jansen B — &quot;See&quot; Carrel.
* Jansen C — &quot;See&quot; Beketov.
* Jansen F — &quot;See&quot; Cajal.

Karl-Marx-Allee () is a boulevard built by the GDR between 1952 and 1960 in Berlin Friedrichshain and Mitte. Today the boulevard is named after Karl Marx. It should not be confused with the &quot;Karl-Marx-Straße&quot; in the Neukölln district of Berlin.

The boulevard was named Stalinallee between 1949 and 1961 (previously &quot;Große Frankfurter Straße&quot;), and was a flagship building project of East Germany&#x27;s reconstruction programme after World War II. It was designed by the architects Hermann Henselmann, Hartmann, Hopp, Leucht, Paulick, and Souradny to contain spacious and luxurious apartments for workers, as well as shops, restaurants, cafés, a tourist hotel, and an enormous cinema, the Kino International.

The avenue, which is wide and long, is lined with monumental eight-story buildings designed in the wedding-cake style, the socialist classicism of the Soviet Union. At each end are dual towers at Frankfurter Tor and Strausberger Platz designed by Hermann Henselmann. The buildings differ in the revetments of the facades which contain often equally, traditional Berlin motifs by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Most of the buildings are covered by architectural ceramics. 

By 1989 half the tiles on the outer facades of these buildings had fallen off, necessitating sheltering structures over the sidewalks in some places to protect pedestrians. 

A monumental Stalin statue presented to the East German government by a Komsomol delegation on the occasion of the Third World Festival of Youth and Students was formally dedicated on 3 August 1951 after being temporarily placed at a location on the newly designed and impressive boulevard. It remained there until 1961 when it was removed in a clandestine operation in the course of de-Stalinization.

On 17 June 1953 the Stalinallee became the focus of a worker uprising which endangered the young state&#x27;s existence. Builders and construction workers demonstrated against the communist government, leading to a national uprising. The rebellion was crushed with Soviet tanks and troops, resulting in the deaths of 125 people. 

Later the street was used for East Germany&#x27;s annual May Day parade, featuring thousands of soldiers along with tanks and other military vehicles to showcase the power and the glory of the communist government.

De-Stalinization led to the renaming of the street, after the founder of Marxism, in late 1961. Since the collapse of Eastern European communism in 1989/1990, renaming the street back to its prewar name &quot;Große Frankfurter Straße&quot; has periodically been discussed, so far without conclusive results.

The boulevard later found favour with postmodernists, with Philip Johnson describing it as &#x27;true city planning on the grand scale&#x27;, while Aldo Rossi called it &#x27;Europe&#x27;s last great street.&#x27; Since German reunification most of the buildings, including the two towers, have been restored.

==Commerce==
The boulevard developed into a commerce-centre in the GDR. It also served the ideological function of introducing visitors to the culture of its &quot;socialist sister states&quot;. Commerce was a mixed experience for visitors from the West. Most stores would not accept payment for purchased items without a receipt from an East German bank showing that the West German Marks had been exchanged for East German Marks at a rate of 1:1. In the West, the exchange rate was 1:8 but most restaurants and bookstores were not concerned with these requirements so bargains were to be found.

==&quot;Stalin&#x27;s bathroom&quot;==
In February 2009, an anonymous author edited the article &quot;Karl-Marx-Allee&quot; in the German-language edition of Wikipedia, claiming that during the time of the GDR the road had acquired the nickname &quot;Stalin&#x27;s bathroom&quot; due to the buildings&#x27; tiled façades. Subsequently, several media outlets reiterated this claim. No alternative verification for the term was given, making it a self-referential claim.

After a letter written to the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; questioned whether the term &quot;Stalin&#x27;s bathroom&quot; had actually been in common use during the GDR period, Andreas Kopietz, a journalist at the newspaper, published an article admitting he had invented the phrase and identifying himself as the original anonymous Wikipedia editor, allowing the record to be set straight.

== In popular media ==
The boulevard is referenced under its former name, the Stalinallee, in the satirical poem &quot;Die Lösung&quot; by Bertolt Brecht about the East German uprising of 1953.

<doc id="976833" wikidata="Q1198671" url="?curid=976833" title="Japanese battleship Ise">
<text>was the lead ship of her class of two dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1910s. Although completed in 1917, she played no role in World War I. &quot;Ise&quot; supported Japanese forces in the early 1920s during the Siberian Intervention in the Russian Civil War. In 1923, she assisted survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake. The ship was partially modernised in two stages in 1928–1929 and 1931–1932, during which her forward superstructure was rebuilt in the pagoda mast style. &quot;Ise&quot; was reconstructed in 1934–1937, with improvements to her armour and her propulsion machinery. Afterwards she played a minor role in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Despite the expensive reconstruction, the ship was considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War, and did not see significant action in the early years of the war. Following the loss of most of the IJN&#x27;s large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid-1942, she was rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give her the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes; lack of aircraft and qualified pilots meant that &quot;Ise&quot; never actually operated aircraft in combat. She participated in the Battle off Cape Engaño in late 1944, where she was one of the ships that decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches. Afterwards the ship was transferred to Southeast Asia. In early 1945 &quot;Ise&quot; participated in Operation Kita, where she transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan. The ship was then reduced to reserve until American airstrikes in July sank her. After the war &quot;Ise&quot; was scrapped in 1946–1947.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Ise&quot; class was designed as an improved version of the preceding . The ships had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load, roughly more than the earlier ships. Their crew consisted of 1,360 officers and ratings.

During the ships&#x27; modernisation in the 1930s, their forward superstructure was enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod masts to create a pagoda mast. Both ships were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the extra armour. These changes increased their overall length to , their beam to and their draught to . Their displacement increased by over to at deep load. The crew now numbered 1,376 officers and enlisted men.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships had two sets of direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 24 Kampon Ro Gō water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of and give the ships a speed of . &quot;Ise&quot; reached from during her sea trials. Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil, and the ships carried enough of both to give them a range of at a speed of .

During their 1930s modernisation, the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kampon oil-fired boilers. The turbines were replaced by four geared Kampon turbines with a designed output of intended to increase their speed to . On her trials, &quot;Ise&quot; reached a top speed of from . The fuel storage of the ships was increased, which gave them a range of at a speed of , despite the additional weight.

===Armament===
The twelve Type 41 guns of the &quot;Ise&quot; class were mounted in three pairs of twin-gun, superfiring turrets that were numbered one through six from front to rear. The first pair was forward of the main superstructure, the second pair was amidships, and the last ones were aft of the rear superstructure. The ships&#x27; secondary armament consisted of twenty Type 3 guns in single mounts. Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by four 3rd Year Type 8-centimetre (3 in) anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with six submerged torpedo tubes, three on each broadside.

In 1931–1933 the AA guns were replaced with eight Type 89 dual-purpose guns, placed beside the forward superstructure in four twin-gun mounts. Two twin-gun mounts for licence-built Vickers two-pounder () light AA guns were also added, while the pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed.

During the mid-1930s reconstruction, the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two-pounders were replaced by 20 licence-built Hotchkiss Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin-gun mounts. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from serious design shortcomings that heavily reduced its effectiveness. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts &quot;lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast&quot;. During the reconstruction the forward pair of 14-centimetre guns in the forecastle were removed and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to +30 degrees.

===Protection===
The &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships&#x27; waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of of Vickers cemented armour amidships; below it was a strake of armour. The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel totaling thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high-tensile steel, but only thick in total. The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of on the face and 76 mm on the roof. The casemate armour was thick and that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm.

===Fire control and sensors===
While the details of the ship&#x27;s fire-control instruments are not fully available, &quot;Ise&quot; was fitted with a gunnery director after completion. In the late 1920s the fire-control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them. A pair of directors for the 12.7 cm AA guns were added in the early 1930s, one on each side of the forward superstructure. The fire-control systems were again upgraded in the mid-1930s and directors were added for the 2.5 cm AA guns. The ship had a rangefinder installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time. Type 21 air-search radars were installed aboard the ship in mid-1942.

===Aircraft===
&quot;Ise&quot; was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying-off platform for a Mitsubishi 1MF3 fighter on Turret No. 2 in 1927. It was replaced by a platform on Turret No. 5 for a Yokosuka E1Y reconnaissance floatplane in 1928–1929. A catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the stern during the mid-1930s modernisation, and the ship was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Ise&quot;, named after Ise Province, one of the traditional provinces of Japan, was laid down at the Kawasaki Heavy Industries shipyard in Kobe on 5 May 1915 and launched on 12 November 1916. Captain Akizawa Yoshima assumed command on 1 December and the ship was completed on 15 December 1917, too late for service in World War I. &quot;Ise&quot; was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–1918. Captain Kuwashima Shozo relieved Akizawa on 1 December 1918 and he was relieved in his turn by Captain Furukawa Hiroshi on 20 November 1919. On 29 August 1920, the ship began the first of numerous patrols off the Siberian coast and in northern waters in support of Japan&#x27;s Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. Captain Yokoo Hisashi replaced Furukawa on 20 November and he was replaced by Captain Nagasawa Naotaro in his turn on 1 December 1921.

On 12 April 1922, while at Yokohama, &quot;Ise&quot; hosted a delegation which included the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII), and his second cousin, the future Lord Mountbatten of Burma. Captain Kanna Norikazu relieved Nagasawa on 1 December. The ship aided survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in September 1923. From the early 1920s through the late 1930s, &quot;Ise&quot; mostly cruised off the coast of China. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she helped sink the obsolete destroyer during gunnery training on 10 August 1926. The ship was in 1928–1929, during which her forward superstructure was enlarged and her aviation facilities improved.

Between 20 November 1931 and 10 February 1932, &quot;Ise&quot; had her anti-aircraft armament entirely replaced, her forward superstructure was further enlarged so that it became a pagoda mast, and her stern was modified in preparation for a catapult and crane at Kure Naval Arsenal. These were installed between 14 May and 6 June 1933. On 15 November, she became a training ship. &quot;Ise&quot;″s crew participated in the state funeral of Marshal-Admiral The Marquis Tōgō Heihachirō, victor of the 1905 Battle of Tsushima, on 15 June 1934.
Beginning on 1 August 1935, &quot;Ise&quot; was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal and underwent an extensive reconstruction and modernisation that lasted until 23 March 1937. On 9 April 1938, the ship began the first of her patrols off the southern Chinese coast during the Second Sino-Japanese War that lasted until early 1941. She was transferred to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet on 15 November 1940 and became its flagship on 15 November 1941. Captain Takeda Isamu assumed command of &quot;Ise&quot; on 25 September 1941.

===Start of the Pacific War===
To provide distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor on 8 December, the division, reinforced by the battleships and and the light carrier , sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands and returned six days later. &quot;Ise&quot; had a minor refit at the Kure Naval Arsenal in 19–25 February 1942. Together with the rest of the division, she pursued, but did not catch, the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April. On 11 May &quot;Ise&quot; had an accident which flooded her No. 2 engine room. While under repair, the ship was fitted with one of the first experimental Type 21 early-warning radar sets in the IJN, but it was removed shortly afterwards.

&quot;Ise&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Battleship Division set sail on 28 May with the Aleutian Support Group at the same time most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI). Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division was composed of Japan&#x27;s four oldest battleships, including &quot;Ise&quot;, accompanied by two light cruisers, 12 destroyers, and two oilers. Official records do not show the division as part of the larger Midway operation, known as Operation AL; they were to accompany the fleet under Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, but were only to provide support to the Aleutian task force if needed.

===Conversion to a hybrid carrier===

The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June severely limited the ability of the IJN to conduct operations and alternatives were sought. Plans for full conversions of battleships into aircraft carriers were rejected on the grounds of expense and, more critically, time, so the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets from the &quot;Ise&quot;-class ships and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two rotating catapults. &quot;Ise&quot; began her conversion on 23 February 1943 and Takeda was relieved by Captain Hase Shinzaburo on 25 April. The ship&#x27;s No. 5 and No. 6 turrets were replaced by a hangar surmounted by a flight deck. This was not long enough to permit the launch of aircraft or their recovery. Two catapults were installed and the existing crane was moved to the flight deck. The deck was fitted with an extensive system of rails to link each catapult, the storage positions on the deck and the T-shaped aircraft lift that moved aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar. It had a capacity of nine aircraft, the remainder being stowed on deck and one on each catapult for a total of 22–24. The ship&#x27;s air group was intended to consist of a dozen each Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; dive bombers (Allied reporting name &quot;Judy&quot;), modified for catapult launching, and Aichi E16A reconnaissance aircraft (Allied reporting name &quot;Paul&quot;). The former had to land either on a conventional carrier or on land bases, whereas the E16A could be hoisted back aboard using a crane, after landing on the water near the ship.

During the conversion, all the 14 cm guns were removed and the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft suite was heavily reinforced. The eight 12.7 cm Type 89 guns were supplemented with four additional twin mounts and the existing 2.5 cm Type 96 AA twin-gun mounts were replaced by 19 triple-gun mounts for a total of 57 weapons.

These changes increased the ship&#x27;s overall length to and the removal of the heavy gun turrets and their barbettes reduced her displacement to at deep load, despite the addition of more fuel oil storage. The extra fuel increased &quot;Ise&quot;″s range to . The weight reductions decreased her draught to . The crew now numbered 1,463 officers and enlisted men.
The rebuild was officially completed on 8 October 1943 and &quot;Ise&quot; made a sortie to Truk later that month, conveying a detachment of the 52nd Division and supplies. Hase was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and the ship began formally working up 10 days later. Captain Nakase Noboru relieved Hase on 25 December.

On 25 February 1944, Battleship Division 2 was assigned to the direct control of the Combined Fleet. &quot;Ise&quot; and her sister ship were transferred to the Third Fleet and assigned to the newly reformed Fourth Carrier Division on 1 May, commanded by Rear Admiral Chiaki Matsuda. That same day the 634th Naval Air Group was formed and assigned to the Fourth Carrier Division. On 24 May, a pair of Type 22 surface-search radars were installed aboard the ship. From 31 May to 7 June, &quot;Ise&quot;″s light anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 47 additional Type 96 AA guns in 12 triple and 11 single mounts, which brought her total to 104 guns. Two Type 2 IFF units were also installed.

On 23 June, the sisters conducted their first catapult training, each with four D4Ys and six E16As aboard; subsequent sessions were conducted on 21 July and 31 August. A pair of Type 13 early-warning radars and an E27 radar detector were installed from 22 to 26 July. From 28 September to 10 October, six racks of 30-tube 12.7 cm anti-aircraft rocket launchers were added. Training of the D4Y and E16A aircrew was slowed by technical problems and was generally conducted from land bases. By 1 October the 634th had on strength 17 D4Ys, of which 6 were serviceable, and 18 E16As, of which 16 were operable.

===Battle off Cape Engaño and afterwards===

After the Americans began attacking Japanese installations in the Bonin Islands on 10 October 1944, the aircraft of the Fourth Carrier Division were ordered to prepare for combat by the commander of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda. Two days later, the 634th Naval Air Group was reassigned to the Second Air Fleet and began flying to bases in southern Kyushu, among these were nine D4Ys and a dozen E16As assigned to &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot;. On 14 October they attacked the aircraft carriers of Task Force 38 near Formosa with little effect and heavy losses. The following day Nakase was promoted to rear admiral.

The ships of the Fourth Carrier Division were assigned to the Main Body of the 1st Mobile Fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa. The Main Body&#x27;s role was to act as a decoy to attract attention away from the two other forces approaching from the south and west. All forces were to converge on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was within range of the northernmost American carriers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa ordered an air strike launched by the Third Carrier Division (&quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot; had no aircraft aboard) to attract the attention of the Americans. This accomplished little else as the Japanese aircraft failed to penetrate past the defending fighters; the survivors landed at airfields on the Philippine island of Luzon. The Americans were preoccupied dealing with the other Japanese naval forces and defending themselves from air attacks launched from Luzon and Leyte and could not spare any aircraft to search for the Japanese carriers until the afternoon. They finally found them, but Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 38, decided that it was too late in the day to mount an effective strike. He did, however, turn all his ships north to position himself for a dawn attack on the Japanese carriers the next day.
On the morning of 25 October, &quot;Ise&quot; was positioned astern of the carriers and to protect them with her anti-aircraft guns. Her radar picked up American aircraft at a range of at 07:39. The first attack began at 08:20, with the old battleship engaging enemy aircraft with San Shiki anti-aircraft shells from her main guns with unknown effect. She was not heavily attacked, but two bombs fell nearby. The second wave of aircraft attacked at 10:05 and the ship&#x27;s gunners claimed to have shot down five of the ten dive bombers. &quot;Ise&quot; was near missed eight times, although one small bomb struck No. 2 turret. The third wave was detected by her radar at 12:28, but it did not attack the battleship, sinking the damaged &quot;Zuikaku&quot; and &quot;Zuihō&quot; instead. &quot;Ise&quot; rescued 98 survivors from &quot;Zuihō&quot; before the next attack began around 17:26. She was the primary focus of this wave and was attacked by about 85 dive bombers and at least 11 torpedo bombers. Saved by heavy anti-aircraft fire and expert manoeuvring, the battleship dodged all the torpedoes, and was struck by only one bomb, near the port catapult. Roughly 34 near misses damaged her hull plating near the waterline and started a small leak that contaminated a small oil tank and caused minor damage to the port boiler rooms. Splinters from the near misses and the single hit killed 5 crewmen and wounded 71.

The American submarine spotted the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvred to attack, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa ordered Matsuda to take his ships south to defend the light cruiser and her escorting destroyers that were attempting to rescue survivors of the crippled light carrier despite gunfire from a group of four American cruisers. Unable to locate either group of ships, Ozawa ordered Matsuda to reverse course at 23:30 and head for Amami Ōshima to refuel. Despite being spotted by American submarines en route, the division arrived safely on 27 October. After leaving the island the following day, they were unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before their arrival at Kure on the 29th.

Between 29 October and 8 November, the catapults were removed to improve the firing arcs of No. 3 and No. 4 turrets. &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot; departed on 11 November, loaded with troops and munitions for Manila, capital of the Philippines, but news was received of heavy American air attacks on Manila and they were diverted to the Spratly Islands. They arrived on 14 November and their cargo was unloaded so it could be transferred to the Philippines. The 4th Carrier Division was transferred to the 2nd Fleet the following day. Reinforced by the battleship and three cruisers, the sisters proceeded on to Lingga Island, near Singapore, on 20 November. They arrived two days later and remained there until 12 December when they departed for Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, where they were on standby for an attack on an American supply convoy bound for the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. The attack was cancelled on the 30th and the ships sailed for Singapore where they arrived on 1 January 1945 before continuing on to Lingga. That same day the Fourth Carrier Division was transferred to the Southwest Area Fleet.

===Final role===
On 6 February, the division sailed for Singapore to participate in Operation Kita. While approaching Singapore, &quot;Ise&quot; was slightly damaged by a mine. Given temporary repairs at the former British naval base there, &quot;Ise&quot;, &quot;Hyūga&quot;, and the light cruiser were loaded with critically needed strategic war supplies (oil, rubber, tin, zinc, and mercury) and 1,150 surplus oil workers to be ferried back to Japan.
The division sailed from Singapore on 10 February and was spotted by the British submarine the following day. It was forced to submerge by a maritime patrol aircraft and was unable to attack. On 13 February the submarine unsuccessfully attacked the ships as did the submarine . One of &quot;Ise&quot;″s AA guns caused one of &quot;Blower&quot;″s torpedoes to detonate prematurely. Later that afternoon, &quot;Ōyodo&quot; launched one of her floatplanes which spotted the submarine on the surface about ahead of the convoy. &quot;Hyūga&quot; opened fire with her main guns and forced &quot;Bashaw&quot; to submerge when one of her shells landed within of the submarine. The convoy reached the Matsu Islands, off the Chinese coast, on the 15th and was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before they reached Zhoushan Island, near Shanghai that night. The convoy reached Kure on 20 February, having evaded or escaped pursuit by 23 Allied submarines along the way. Nakase was relieved by Captain Mutaguchi Kakuro five days later.

The 4th Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and &quot;Ise&quot; was reduced to first-class reserve. From this time until the surrender of Japan, &quot;Ise&quot; remained docked at Kure, without fuel or aircraft, and repainted in an olive green camouflage with vari-coloured splotches. The camouflage was not effective against American carrier-based aircraft from Task Force 58 (TF 58) on 19 March, when more than 240 aircraft attacked Kure and &quot;Ise&quot; was hit by two bombs. Re-designated as a fourth-class reserve ship on 20 April, &quot;Ise&quot; was towed to the island of Ondo Seto (between Kure and Kurahashijima) to serve as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was attacked again on 24 July by 60 carrier-based aircraft, whose bombs hit the starboard bow, flight deck, main deck, No. 3 turret and bridge, killing Mutaguchi, other bridge personnel, and around 50 crewmen; many other crewmen were wounded. The ship settled by the bow; it took three days to pump her dry. The IJN planned to drydock her for repairs but she was struck by five bombs dropped by F4U Corsair fighters from , and eleven more bombs dropped by other aircraft from TF 58 on 28 July. Later that day an attack by 18 USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers was unsuccessful. &quot;Ise&quot; took on a 15° list to starboard and sank in shallow water. Salvage efforts were abandoned that same day, although some AA guns were stripped from her wreck. The ship was struck from the Navy Directory on 20 November. The underwater portion of &quot;Ise&quot;″s wreck was ignored until the following year and she was scrapped in place by the Kure Dockyard of the Harima Zōsen Corporation from 9 October 1946 to 4 July 1947.

<doc id="976834" wikidata="Q130603417" url="?curid=976834" title="Decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)">
<text>The spectrum of a linear operator formula_1 that operates on a Banach space formula_2 is a fundamental concept of functional analysis. The spectrum consists of all scalars formula_3 such that the operator formula_4 does not have a bounded inverse on formula_2. The spectrum has a standard decomposition into three parts: 

* a point spectrum, consisting of the eigenvalues of formula_1;
* a continuous spectrum, consisting of the scalars that are not eigenvalues but make the range of formula_4 a proper dense subset of the space;
* a residual spectrum, consisting of all other scalars in the spectrum.

This decomposition is relevant to the study of differential equations, and has applications to many branches of science and engineering. A well-known example from quantum mechanics is the explanation for the discrete spectral lines and the continuous band in the light emitted by excited atoms of hydrogen.

== Decomposition into point spectrum, continuous spectrum, and residual spectrum ==

=== For bounded Banach space operators ===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a Banach space, &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) the family of bounded operators on &quot;X&quot;, and . By definition, a complex number &quot;λ&quot; is in the spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, denoted &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), if does not have an inverse in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).

If is one-to-one and onto, i.e. bijective, then its inverse is bounded; this follows directly from the open mapping theorem of functional analysis. So, &quot;λ&quot; is in the spectrum of &quot;T&quot; if and only if is not one-to-one or not onto. One distinguishes three separate cases:

# is not injective. That is, there exist two distinct elements &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that . Then is a non-zero vector such that . In other words, &quot;λ&quot; is an eigenvalue of &quot;T&quot; in the sense of linear algebra. In this case, &quot;λ&quot; is said to be in the point spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, denoted .
# is injective, and its range is a dense subset &quot; R&quot; of &quot;X&quot;; but is not the whole of &quot;X&quot;. In other words, there exists some element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that can be as close to &quot;x&quot; as desired, with &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;; but is never equal to &quot;x&quot;. It can be proved that, in this case, is not bounded below (i.e. it sends far apart elements of &quot;X&quot; too close together). Equivalently, the inverse linear operator , which is defined on the dense subset &quot;R&quot;, is not a bounded operator, and therefore cannot be extended to the whole of &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;λ&quot; is said to be in the continuous spectrum, , of &quot;T&quot;.
# is injective but does not have dense range. That is, there is some element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and a neighborhood &quot;N&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that is never in &quot;N&quot;. In this case, the map may be bounded or unbounded, but in any case does not admit a unique extension to a bounded linear map on all of &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;λ&quot; is said to be in the residual spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, .

So &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the disjoint union of these three sets,
formula_8The complement of the spectrum formula_9 is known as resolvent set formula_10 that is formula_11.

In addition, when does not have dense range, whether is injective or not, then &quot;λ&quot; is said to be in the compression spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;σcp&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). The compression spectrum consists of the whole residual spectrum and part of point spectrum.

=== For unbounded operators ===
The spectrum of an unbounded operator can be divided into three parts in the same way as in the bounded case, but because the operator is not defined everywhere, the definitions of domain, inverse, etc. are more involved.

=== Examples ===

==== Multiplication operator ====

Given a σ-finite measure space (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;Σ&quot;, &quot;μ&quot;), consider the Banach space &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;). A function &quot;h&quot;: &quot;S&quot; → C is called essentially bounded if &quot;h&quot; is bounded &quot;μ&quot;-almost everywhere. An essentially bounded &quot;h&quot; induces a bounded multiplication operator &quot;Th&quot; on &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;):
formula_12

The operator norm of &quot;T&quot; is the essential supremum of &quot;h&quot;. The essential range of &quot;h&quot; is defined in the following way: a complex number &quot;λ&quot; is in the essential range of &quot;h&quot; if for all &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, the preimage of the open ball &quot;Bε&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) under &quot;h&quot; has strictly positive measure. We will show first that &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;Th&quot;) coincides with the essential range of &quot;h&quot; and then examine its various parts.

If &quot;λ&quot; is not in the essential range of &quot;h&quot;, take &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 such that &quot;h&quot;−1(&quot;Bε&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;)) has zero measure. The function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = 1/(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) − &quot;λ&quot;) is bounded almost everywhere by 1/&quot;ε&quot;. The multiplication operator &quot;Tg&quot; satisfies . So &quot;λ&quot; does not lie in spectrum of &quot;Th&quot;. On the other hand, if &quot;λ&quot; lies in the essential range of &quot;h&quot;, consider the sequence of sets . Each &quot;Sn&quot; has positive measure. Let &quot;fn&quot; be the characteristic function of &quot;Sn&quot;. We can compute directly
formula_13

This shows is not bounded below, therefore not invertible.

If &quot;λ&quot; is such that &quot;μ&quot;( &quot;h&quot;−1({&quot;λ&quot;})) &gt; 0, then &quot;λ&quot; lies in the point spectrum of &quot;Th&quot; as follows. Let &quot;f&quot; be the characteristic function of the measurable set &quot;h&quot;−1(&quot;λ&quot;), then by considering two cases, we find
formula_14
so λ is an eigenvalue of &quot;T&quot;&quot;h&quot;.

Any &quot;λ&quot; in the essential range of &quot;h&quot; that does not have a positive measure preimage is in the continuous spectrum of &quot;Th&quot;. To show this, we must show that has dense range. Given , again we consider the sequence of sets . Let &quot;gn&quot; be the characteristic function of . Define
formula_15

Direct calculation shows that &quot;fn&quot; ∈ &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;), with formula_16. Then by the dominated convergence theorem,
formula_17
in the &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) norm.

Therefore, multiplication operators have no residual spectrum. In particular, by the spectral theorem, normal operators on a Hilbert space have no residual spectrum.

==== Shifts ====

In the special case when &quot;S&quot; is the set of natural numbers and &quot;μ&quot; is the counting measure, the corresponding &quot;Lp&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) is denoted by l&quot;p&quot;. This space consists of complex valued sequences {&quot;xn&quot;} such that
formula_18

For 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, &quot;l p&quot; is reflexive. Define the left shift &quot;T&quot; : &quot;l p&quot; → &quot;l p&quot; by
formula_19

&quot;T&quot; is a partial isometry with operator norm 1. So &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) lies in the closed unit disk of the complex plane.

&quot;T*&quot; is the right shift (or unilateral shift), which is an isometry on &quot;l q&quot;, where 1/&quot;p&quot; + 1/&quot;q&quot; = 1:
formula_20

For &quot;λ&quot; ∈ C with |&quot;λ&quot;| &lt; 1,
formula_21
and &quot;T x&quot; = &quot;λ x&quot;. Consequently, the point spectrum of &quot;T&quot; contains the open unit disk. Now, &quot;T*&quot; has no eigenvalues, i.e. &quot;σp&quot;(&quot;T*&quot;) is empty. Thus, invoking reflexivity and the theorem in Spectrum_(functional_analysis)#Spectrum_of_the_adjoint_operator (that &quot;σp&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) ⊂ &quot;σr&quot;(&quot;T&quot;*) ∪ &quot;σp&quot;(&quot;T&quot;*)), we can deduce that the open unit disk lies in the residual spectrum of &quot;T*&quot;.

The spectrum of a bounded operator is closed, which implies the unit circle, { |&quot;λ&quot;| = 1 } ⊂ C, is in &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). Again by reflexivity of &quot;l p&quot; and the theorem given above (this time, that ), we have that &quot;σr&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is also empty. Therefore, for a complex number &quot;λ&quot; with unit norm, one must have &quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;σp&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) or &quot;λ&quot; ∈ &quot;σc&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). Now if |&quot;λ&quot;| = 1 and
formula_22
then
formula_23
which cannot be in &quot;l p&quot;, a contradiction. This means the unit circle must lie in the continuous spectrum of &quot;T&quot;.

So for the left shift &quot;T&quot;, &quot;σp&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the open unit disk and &quot;σc&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is the unit circle, whereas for the right shift &quot;T*&quot;, &quot;σr&quot;(&quot;T*&quot;) is the open unit disk and &quot;σc&quot;(&quot;T*&quot;) is the unit circle.

For &quot;p&quot; = 1, one can perform a similar analysis. The results will not be exactly the same, since reflexivity no longer holds.

== Self-adjoint operators on Hilbert space ==

Hilbert spaces are Banach spaces, so the above discussion applies to bounded operators on Hilbert spaces as well. A subtle point concerns the spectrum of &quot;T&quot;*. For a Banach space, &quot;T&quot;* denotes the transpose and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T*&quot;) = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). For a Hilbert space, &quot;T&quot;* normally denotes the adjoint of an operator &quot;T&quot; ∈ &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), not the transpose, and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T*&quot;) is not &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) but rather its image under complex conjugation.

For a self-adjoint &quot;T&quot; ∈ &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), the Borel functional calculus gives additional ways to break up the spectrum naturally.

=== Borel functional calculus ===
This subsection briefly sketches the development of this calculus. The idea is to first establish the continuous functional calculus, and then pass to measurable functions via the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem. For the continuous functional calculus, the key ingredients are the following:

# If &quot;T&quot; is self-adjoint, then for any polynomial &quot;P&quot;, the operator norm satisfies formula_24
# The Stone–Weierstrass theorem, which implies that the family of polynomials (with complex coefficients), is dense in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)), the continuous functions on &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;).

The family &quot;C&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)) is a Banach algebra when endowed with the uniform norm. So the mapping
formula_25
is an isometric homomorphism from a dense subset of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)) to &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;). Extending the mapping by continuity gives &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) for &quot;f&quot; ∈ C(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)): let &quot;Pn&quot; be polynomials such that &quot;Pn&quot; → &quot;f&quot; uniformly and define &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = lim &quot;Pn&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). This is the continuous functional calculus.

For a fixed &quot;h&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;, we notice that
formula_26
is a positive linear functional on &quot;C&quot;(&quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)). According to the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem a unique measure &quot;μh&quot; on &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) exists such that
formula_27

This measure is sometimes called the spectral measure associated to &quot; h&quot;. The spectral measures can be used to extend the continuous functional calculus to bounded Borel functions. For a bounded function &quot;g&quot; that is Borel measurable, define, for a proposed &quot;g&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)
formula_28

Via the polarization identity, one can recover (since &quot;H&quot; is assumed to be complex)
formula_29
and therefore &quot;g&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) &quot;h&quot; for arbitrary &quot;h&quot;.

In the present context, the spectral measures, combined with a result from measure theory, give a decomposition of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;).

=== Decomposition into absolutely continuous, singular continuous, and pure point ===

Let &quot;h&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; and &quot;μh&quot; be its corresponding spectral measure on &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;). According to a refinement of Lebesgue&#x27;s decomposition theorem, &quot;μh&quot; can be decomposed into three mutually singular parts:
formula_30
where &quot;μ&quot;ac is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, &quot;μ&quot;sc is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and atomless, and &quot;μ&quot;pp is a pure point measure.

All three types of measures are invariant under linear operations. Let &quot;H&quot;ac be the subspace consisting of vectors whose spectral measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Define &quot;H&quot;pp and &quot;H&quot;sc in analogous fashion. These subspaces are invariant under &quot;T&quot;. For example, if &quot;h&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;ac and &quot;k&quot; = &quot;T h&quot;. Let &quot;χ&quot; be the characteristic function of some Borel set in &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;), then
formula_31
So
formula_32
and &quot;k&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;ac. Furthermore, applying the spectral theorem gives
formula_33

This leads to the following definitions:

#The spectrum of &quot;T&quot; restricted to &quot;H&quot;ac is called the absolutely continuous spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;ac(&quot;T&quot;).
#The spectrum of &quot;T&quot; restricted to &quot;H&quot;sc is called its singular spectrum, &quot;σ&quot;sc(&quot;T&quot;).
#The set of eigenvalues of &quot;T&quot; is called the pure point spectrum of &quot;T&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;pp(&quot;T&quot;).

The closure of the eigenvalues is the spectrum of &quot;T&quot; restricted to &quot;H&quot;pp.
So
formula_34

=== Comparison ===

A bounded self-adjoint operator on Hilbert space is, a fortiori, a bounded operator on a Banach space. Therefore, one can also apply to &quot;T&quot; the decomposition of the spectrum that was achieved above for bounded operators on a Banach space. Unlike the Banach space formulation, the union
formula_35
need not be disjoint. It is disjoint when the operator &quot;T&quot; is of uniform multiplicity, say &quot;m&quot;, i.e. if &quot;T&quot; is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by &quot;λ&quot; on the direct sum
formula_36
for some Borel measures formula_37. When more than one measure appears in the above expression, we see that it is possible for the union of the three types of spectra to not be disjoint. If , &quot;λ&quot; is sometimes called an eigenvalue &quot;embedded&quot; in the absolutely continuous spectrum.

When &quot;T&quot; is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by &quot;λ&quot; on
formula_38
the decomposition of &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) from Borel functional calculus is a refinement of the Banach space case.

=== Quantum mechanics ===

The preceding comments can be extended to the unbounded self-adjoint operators since Riesz-Markov holds for locally compact Hausdorff spaces.

In quantum mechanics, observables are (often unbounded) self-adjoint operators and their spectra are the possible outcomes of measurements.

The pure point spectrum corresponds to bound states in the following way:
* A quantum state is a bound state if and only if it is finitely normalizable for all times formula_39.
* An observable has pure point spectrum if and only if its eigenstates form an orthonormal basis of formula_40.
A particle is said to be in a bound state if it remains &quot;localized&quot; in a bounded region of space. Intuitively one might therefore think that the &quot;discreteness&quot; of the spectrum is intimately related to the corresponding states being &quot;localized&quot;. However, a careful mathematical analysis shows that this is not true in general. For example, consider the function 
:formula_41
This function is normalizable (i.e. formula_42) as
:formula_43
Known as the Basel problem, this series converges to formula_44. Yet, formula_45 increases as formula_46, i.e, the state &quot;escapes to infinity&quot;. The phenomena of Anderson localization and dynamical localization describe when the eigenfunctions are localized in a physical sense. Anderson Localization means that eigenfunctions decay exponentially as formula_47. Dynamical localization is more subtle to define.

Sometimes, when performing quantum mechanical measurements, one encounters &quot;eigenstates&quot; that are not localized, e.g., quantum states that do not lie in &quot;L&quot;2(R). These are free states belonging to the absolutely continuous spectrum. In the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators, these states are referred to as &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot; of an observable with &quot;generalized eigenvalues&quot; that do not necessarily belong to its spectrum. Alternatively, if it is insisted that the notion of eigenvectors and eigenvalues survive the passage to the rigorous, one can consider operators on rigged Hilbert spaces. 

An example of an observable whose spectrum is purely absolutely continuous is the position operator of a free particle moving on the entire real line. Also, since the momentum operator is unitarily equivalent to the position operator, via the Fourier transform, it has a purely absolutely continuous spectrum as well.

The singular spectrum correspond to physically impossible outcomes. It was believed for some time that the singular spectrum was something artificial. However, examples as the almost Mathieu operator and random Schrödinger operators have shown, that all types of spectra arise naturally in physics.

== Decomposition into essential spectrum and discrete spectrum ==

Let formula_48 be a closed operator defined on the domain formula_49 which is dense in &quot;X&quot;. Then there is a decomposition of the spectrum of &quot;A&quot; into a disjoint union,
formula_50
where
# formula_51 is the fifth type of the essential spectrum of &quot;A&quot; (if &quot;A&quot; is a self-adjoint operator, then formula_52 for all formula_53);
# formula_54 is the discrete spectrum of &quot;A&quot;, which consists of normal eigenvalues, or, equivalently, of isolated points of formula_55 such that the corresponding Riesz projector has a finite rank. It is a proper subset of the point spectrum, i.e., formula_56, as the set of eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; need not necessarily be isolated points of the spectrum.

<text>Siġġiewi (, ), also called by its title Città Ferdinand, is a city and a local council in the Southern Region of Malta. It is the third largest council in Malta by surface area, after Rabat and Mellieħa. Siġġiewi is situated on a plateau a few kilometers away from Mdina (the ancient capital city of Malta) and away from Valletta, the contemporary capital. 

==History==

In its demographic and topographical formation, Siġġiewi followed a pattern common to other villages in Malta. Before the arrival of the Order of St John in 1530, there were other thriving hamlets in the area. Little by little, Ħal Xluq, Ħal Kbir, Ħal Niklusi, and Ħal Qdieri were absorbed in Siġġiewi and today only their secluded chapels remain.

The origins of the name Siġġiewi are unknown. The name is unique and bears no resemblance to well-known words. &quot;Siġġiewi&quot; may be a corruption of an old name. The areas around Siġġiewi were inhabited since the Maltese islands were occupied by the first farmers during the Neolithic period. The Neolithic sites of Hagar Qim and Mnajdra (3600-2500 BC) are within three kilometers of the village. Also within easy reach of the village are the Bronze Age settlement of Wardija ta’ San Gorg, almost at the southern tail end of Dingli Cliffs, and the Bronze Age cart ruts at ix-Xaghra ta’ Ghar il-Kbir (1500-750/800 BC).

An early Phoenician tomb was located in the area, and small Phoenician/Punic cemeteries are known to be on the hilltop of tal-Gholja and at ix-Xaghra ta’ Ghar il-kbir. In numerous places, Roman pottery scatters are often encountered, suggesting that the environs of Siġġiewi were also occupied during the Roman occupation of Malta and Gozo.

A series of early Christian catacombs are located close to Maghlaq valley. One of these, published in several sources, has been intentionally buried under a field.

Siġġiewi&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Nicholas, is perhaps one of the most popular saints in Byzantine hagiography. The survival of the saint&#x27;s veneration may suggest that following the end of the catacomb era, some of Malta&#x27;s villages may have retained old traditions that would very comfortably fall within Western and Eastern Christian domains.
Hundreds of place names are known from various fields and locations around Siġġiewi. These names are Semitic but are of an unknown age, having been recorded in notarial deeds only in the Late Middle Ages. Some of these places developed into hamlets, and others may have supported small communities that were never recorded, but these hamlets would ultimately dwindle in importance in their coming years. The depopulation of the Maltese rural areas during the Great Siege of 1565 hastened the end of small hamlets around Malta and Gozo. The arrival of the Order of St John in Malta in 1530 ushered in new economic dynamics which made the new urban areas, and especially the new city of Valletta, more attractive than isolated villages.

Several buildings in Siġġiewi date back to knight Hospitaller rule, including the Armoury. Siġġiewi itself reflects these new concerns. Its growth may have been at the expense of neighboring hamlets. But market agglomeration around Siġġiewi, a promontory that stands between two important valleys and is therefore defensible, also encouraged geo-demographic changes.

On 30 December 1797, after a formal request by Don Salvatore Curso, on behalf of his parishioners, Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch instituted the village as a city, naming it after himself as &quot;Città Ferdinand&quot;.

The ruins of the former parish church, dedicated to St Nicholas of Bari are still visible today. Lately, great restoration works have been carried out and retrieved from its old glory. The baroque parish church, dedicated to the same saint, was erected by the villagers who raised the necessary funds between the years 1676 to 1693. It was designed by the Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà but underwent some changes throughout the years. The portico and naves were added by Professor Nicola Żammit in the latter half of the 19th century.

The titular painting in the church is by the artist Mattia Preti, &#x27;Il calabrese&#x27;, who was also responsible for the painting on the vault of St John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral in Valletta. The wooden statue which is carried in procession on the city feast day (the last Sunday of June) was sculptured by Pietro Felici in 1736.

Four years earlier, in 1732, the same sculptor had produced the stone statue which still stands in the center of the square. On its pedestal, there is a prayer in Latin which implores the saint to bless the fields which the faithful laboriously till.

==Tourism==

Located in Siġġiewi, is the Girgenti Palace, which was built in 1625 as the summer residence of inquisitor Onorato Visconti. It was renovated by inquisitor Angelo Dorini in 1763. Today, it is the Maltese Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence. The palace of Grand Master Verdalle, known as Verdala Palace, now serves as the Maltese President&#x27;s summer residence. Adjoining this palace is the Buskett, a small semi-wild woodland which Grand Masters such as De Valette used as hunting grounds.

Within the local council of Siġġiewi lies Għar Lapsi, Fawwara, Girgenti, Ta&#x27; Kandja, and the Hill of Laferla Cross. From there the islet of Filfla can be seen on the horizon. The village stands on a flat plateau flanked by two relatively deep valleys (Wied il-Hesri and Wied Xkora).

There are several niches in the old part of the city, some of which date back to the middle of the 17th century and are a sign of devotion as well as architectural decoration. Several small chapels are found within the boundaries of Siġġiewi, including that dedicated to Our Lady of Providence, which is a notable example of Maltese Baroque architecture.

Siġġiewi also celebrates its Feast in the last week of June, in honor of Saint Nicholas, with band marches around the streets, aerial fireworks and Catherine wheels, street decorations, and celebrations in the main church. The Limestone Heritage Park &amp; Gardens is an attraction situated in a renovated quarry. Maltese summer folklore evening also takes place between May and October. Malta Falconry Centre lies just outside the city. 

Until several decades ago, almost all of the population was employed in the fields which surround the city. In 1993, the city adopted the motto &quot;Labore et Virtute&quot; (English translation: &quot;Work and Virtue&quot;).

==Patron saint==
Every village in Malta celebrates the local church&#x27;s patron saint with a major festa lasting a week. When the main Saint Nicholas festa in Siġġiewi is held on the last Sunday in June, the Church of Saint Nicholas is decorated and lit, inside and out. The whole village, houses, and all are festooned with garlands, banners, and flags. Festival week is also a time for visiting and hospitality as people come from all over Malta to enjoy the celebration.

Brass bands march and play in competitions throughout the week. The oldest Siġġiewi band, St. Nicholas Band Club, located on St. Nicholas Square, and the Siġġiewi Festival Brass Band and Social Club, organized in the 1980s, both make the Siġġiewi St. Nicholas feast one of Malta&#x27;s most enjoyable.

As with most festivals, food is important. Food stalls sell ice cream, hot dogs, burgers, kebabs, chips, and more. Special sweets include mqaret, pastry stuffed with dates, and white nougat with almonds or peanuts.

The week features many processions—one night features relics, another, St. Nicholas statue—and religious services. The liturgical music inside the Siġġiewi Parish church is also at its best during this week, starting with the triduum which is followed by a Solemn Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, Solemn Te Deum, Vespers, and Solemn mass on the day of the feast. Siġġiewi is synonymous with music by the famed Paolo Nani.

On the evening before the Sunday feast day, a major procession with brass bands goes through the village. The celebrations also feature a fireworks display. On Sunday the large St. Nicholas statue comes out of the church and goes in procession through the village. This procession has music, incense, confetti thrown by bystanders, and palm branches and flowers. On returning to the church the statue is welcomed with clapping, crying, and singing. Inside the church, the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament follows.

Each town strives to have the most extravagant fireworks and the most accomplished musicians. Festival organizers collect significant funds so they can add to their accumulation of statues, flags, and banners. These rivalries go back a long time—when the churches were built, and parishioners gave generously to build the most elaborate churches they could afford.

Though the main festa, like most traditional festivals in Malta, is in June, The liturgical feast of Saint Nicholas takes place on 6 December. There are also celebrations on this day although not on the large scale of those in June. The 6 December feast has become synonymous with a children&#x27;s procession from the local Primary School to the Parish Church accompanied by the 2 local band clubs. In the evening a solemn mass is celebrated which is followed by fireworks and a musical concert by the Saint Nicholas Band Club. The &#x27;Grupp tal-Armar 6 ta&#x27; Dicembru&#x27; which is responsible for the splendor and decorations worthy of a great feast decorates the main square with six artistic banners.

==Culture and sport==
Siġġiewi is the location of two band clubs, the Banda San Nikola A.D.1883 and the Siġġiewi Festival Brass Band, founded in 1986. The Siġġiewi Festival Brass Band was the first band established in Malta which plays only instruments made of brass. It is also the home of Siġġiewi Rowing Club, Siġġiewi Scout group, Siġġiewi Football Club, and Siġġiewi Basketball Club. The St Nicholas Fireworks Factory is based in the town. Siġġiewi is also home to the ta&#x27; Kandja shooting range which hosted the ISSF Shotgun World Cup in June 2018.

<text>In celestial mechanics, true longitude is the ecliptic longitude at which an orbiting body could actually be found if its inclination were zero. Together with the inclination and the ascending node, the true longitude can tell us the precise direction from the central object at which the body would be located at a particular time.

==Calculation==
The true longitude can be calculated as follows:

where:
* is the orbit&#x27;s true anomaly,
* is the longitude of orbit&#x27;s periapsis,
** is the argument of periapsis, and
** is the longitude of the orbit&#x27;s ascending node,

<text>The Bloch MB.210 and MB.211 were the successors of the French Bloch MB.200 bomber developed by Société des Avions Marcel Bloch in the 1930s and differed primarily in being low wing monoplanes rather than high wing monoplanes.

==Development==
The MB.210 derived from the MB.200 and differs in particular by having its cantilever wing set at the bottom of the fuselage, and in having a retractable undercarriage. Developed as a private venture, the prototype MB.210 accomplished its first flight on 23 November 1934, powered by two 596 kW (800 hp) Gnome-Rhône 14Kdrs / Gnome-Rhône 14Kgrs air-cooled radial engines and having a fixed undercarriage. This was followed by a second prototype, the MB.211 Verdun, powered by 641 kW (860 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Y V-12 liquid-cooled inlines and fitted with a retractable undercarriage, this flying on 29 August 1935. Initial flight testing of this version was somewhat disappointing, so no further examples were built. Further progress with the MB.210, however, convinced the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; to order series production, the first example of which flew on 12 December 1936.

The satisfaction did not last very long, however, since it was underpowered and the engines of production aircraft were inclined to overheating. The type was grounded until its engines could be replaced by the more powerful and reliable Gnome-Rhône 14N, these engines first being tested in summer 1937 and had to be replaced. Altogether, 257 units were manufactured amongst companies as diverse as Les Mureaux over Potez-CAMS, Breguet, Hanriot, and Renault.

==Operational history==

In September 1939, the Bloch MB.210 equipped 12 bomber units of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. At the time of Nazi Germany&#x27;s attack on France in spring 1940, these squadrons were in the middle of a restructuring aimed at removing outdated aircraft from the front line. Up to the armistice on 25 June of the same year, the MB.210 was used still for nighttime bombing missions and shifted then to North Africa.

<text>Holybourne is a village in the civil parish of Alton, in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is 1.3 miles (2.2 km) northeast of the centre of Alton, is contiguous with it and shares its A31 bypass. The nearest railway station also being in Alton.

The village has a population of around 1,500 and is where Treloar School is located. Holybourne has a pub – &quot;The White Hart&quot; – and a small store.

==History==

Holybourne is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Haliborne&quot; and appears in 1418 as &quot;Halybourn&quot;.

The name is thought to be derived from the Old English &quot;Haligburna&quot; which means &quot;sacred stream&quot;, referring to the small stream whose spring is near Holybourne Church whence it runs through the village.

English author Elizabeth Gaskell (1810–1865) bought a house in &quot;Holybourne&quot; in 1865. She died suddenly when visiting the house on 12 November 1865.

Being located close to the former RAF Lasham airfield gliders are often spotted in the sky.

RAF Odiham is home to the British Chinooks and has a flight path over the village at a low level allowing excellent views of the aircraft.

Cuckoo&#x27;s corner, near the end of the village, has the remains of a Roman road and often finds are found in surrounding fields and cricket pitches.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 507. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Alton.

Thomas Yendal, Artist, Lives in the village and uses his disability as a guise to develop houses.

===Complins Brewery===
In the nineteenth century, a brewery was established in Holybourne by Walter Complin, who died in 1890. By the start of the 20th century, it was run by John Fowler Complin. The site is now occupied by a residential area called &quot;Complins&quot;.

==Economy==
There is one pub in the village, The White Hart along with a small shop cum post office.

===Holybourne Oil Terminal===

In 1984, planning permission was granted for the Holybourne Oil Terminal, rail served by the Alton Line, to be the trans-shipment point for production from the Humbly Grove oil field, Lasham, delivery of the oil to be by pipeline. In 1989, further permission was granted to deliver a limited amount of crude oil by road tanker. The freight trains serving Holybourne arrive at Holybourne Freight railway station.

==Church of the Holy Rood==

The Church of the Holy Rood in Holybourne has foundations dating from the 12th century, and the nave, west end and lower part of the tower appear to date from this time. The chancel was added later, completing the building by the 13th century. However, two centuries later the floor of the building was raised, possibly because of nearby springs. The north aisle was replaced in 1879.

=== New bells ===
In autumn 2009, eight new bells manufactured at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry were installed in the church by Whites Bellhangers, of Appleton, Oxon, who cleaned up the existing three bells and re-hung them on a new bell frame installed higher up in the steeple and connected them back to the clock to continue their chiming role.

The new eight bells are in the key of B, and the heaviest (Bell No 8) weighs 6 cwt 3 qtrs 16 lb. They are inscribed and dedicated as follows:
* No 1 Bell: John Milne, writer, 1775–1817
* No 2 Bell: Elizabeth Gaskell, writer, 1810–1865
* No 3 Bell: William Curtis, botanist, 1746–1799
* No 4 Bell: Alfred Munnings, painter, 1878–1959 (the famous equestrian artist, who resided at The White Hart, Holybourne).
* No 5 Bell: Edmund Spenser, poet, 1552–1599
* No 6 Bell: Edward Thomas, poet, 1878–1917
* No 7 Bell: Izaak Walton, angler &amp; biographer, 1593–1683
* No 8 Bell: Rev. Gilbert White, curate &amp; naturalist, 1720–1793
On Sunday, 11 October 2009, there was a Service of Consecration of the eight new bells. On Sunday, 15 November 2009, there was a Service of Dedication by Michael Harley, the Archdeacon of Winchester.
