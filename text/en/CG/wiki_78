== Biography ==

Tadakatsu was born in 1548, in Kuramae, Nukata, Mikawa Province (present-day Nishi-Kuramae, Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture), the eldest son of Honda Tadataka. The Honda clan was one of the oldest &quot;Anjō fudai&quot; families, a family of &quot;fudai daimyo&quot; who had been serving Tokugawa Ieyasu since he was in Anjō.

In 1560, Tadakatsu participated his first battle in the battle of Washizu Fort, where he accompanied his father. Later, he also participated in Ieyasu&#x27;s campaign during the siege of Ōdaka Castle which occurred before the Battle of Okehazama.

In 1561, It was said that when he was aged just 14 years old, Tadakatsu recorded his first kill in battle. At first his uncle, Honda Tadazane, killed an enemy samurai and asked Tadakatsu to cut off the corpse head as trophy for Tadakatsu. However, Tadakatsu stated that he did not want to rely on others to achieve military merit. Tadakatsu followed suit by charging towards the enemy rank and made his own trophy by killing an enemy by his own hand.

Tadakatsu, who became the head of the core branch of Honda clan, was at first a follower of Jōdo Shinshū (True pure land Buddhism). However, as radical sectarian rebels of Ikkō-ikki which following Jōdo Shinshū broke out, Tadakatsu abandoned Jōdo Shinshū and changing his faith to Jōdo-shū(pure land Buddhism), as he stayed loyal to Ieyasu. Tadakatsu joined Ina Tadatsugu, Sakai Tadatsugu, Mizuno Sanzaemon, Torii Mototada, Ōkubo Tadakatsu, and Ishikawa Tadanari to support Ieyasu in suppression of Ikkō-ikki.

Around 1561-1563, The &quot;Ietada nikki&quot; journal has stated at some point of this rebellion, 200 Tokugawa soldiers led by Tadakatsu and Ishikawa Ienari were ambushed and routed by Ikkō-ikki rebels led by Sakai Tadanao.

In 1572, during the Takeda clan campaign in Mikawa, Tadakatsu participated in the forces of Tokugawa. Ieyasu sent him, Naitō Nobunari, and Ōkubo Tadasuke, to lead the vanguard, where they meet Takeda forces led by Yamagata Masakage and Baba Nobuharu at the battle of Hitokotosaka. It is said that in this battle Tadakatsu gained recognition from the enemy forces for his antler helmet and his Tonbo-giri spear for his exploit in staving off the charges of Baba Nobuharu’s units. In the end of this battle, Tadakatsu and Naitō Nobunari fought well, as both of them managed to break through from the encirclement attempts by Takeda forces and managed to lead the Tokugawa forces to escape safely.

In 1573, Tadakatsu also served at Tokugawa&#x27;s greatest defeat, the Battle of Mikatagahara, where he commanded the left wing of his master&#x27;s army, facing off against troops under one of the Takeda clan&#x27;s more notable generals, Naitō Masatoyo. In the prelude of the battle, Tadakatsu managed to ward off the first wave, however, the Tokugawa forces were getting overrun by the next waves of Takeda forces. In the last phase of the battle, Tadakatsu reportedly fought alongside Sakakibara Yasumasa engaging Takeda clan general named Oyamada Masayuki, while Ishikawa Kazumasa were busy covering the retreat of Ieyasu from the battle. In the end, the Tokugawa forces managed to withdraw safely from the battle due to dexterous performance of Tadakatsu in organizing the cover of their retreat.

Later in the same year, Tadakatsu and Sakakibara Yasumasa were tasked to capture Nagashino Castle. Both of them manage to defeat the Takeda clan armies which guarded the castle and completed their mission to capture it. Aside from that, Tadakatsu also captured many other castles in Tōtōmi Province from Takeda clan.

Later in the same month, Tadakatsu was one of the Tokugawa generals present at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. Honda commanded a rank of musketeers as the combined Oda-Tokugawa forces annihilated the Takeda Katsuyori army, due to the skillful use of ranked muskets, as they fired in cycling volleys. In this battle, units under Tadakatsu were facing against Yamagata Masakage, who was killed on his track by a shot from Tadakatsu&#x27;s riflemen. At some point of this battle, 1,500 Takeda soldiers under Naitō Masatoyo managed to break through with 24 men able to climb the third fence to the defensive position of the Oda-Tokugawa forces. Masatoyo was said to almost reach Ieyasu&#x27;s main camp, until Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Osuga Yasutaka came in to block his way. One source recorded that Tadakatsu took his spear and personally engaged Masatoyo&#x27;s soldiers on the frontline, preventing them from encroaching further. Tadakatsu fought hard until the Masatoyo&#x27;s corps were annihilated, while Masatoyo himself captured. The Kansei Chōshū Shokafu chronicle has recorded that in the final phase of the battle, Tadakatsu fought ferociously until the Takeda forces routed, while a retainer of Honda clan named Kaji Masamichi managed to take the heads of Yamagata Masakage and Baba Nobuharu as a prize. Immediately after the Nagashino battle, Tadakatsu and Sakakibara Yasumasa attacked and captured the Suwahara Castle.

In 1581, Tadakatsu participated in the Tokugawa army attack on Tanaka castle which guarded by Takeda clan general named Ichijō Nobutatsu. In this battle, Tadakatsu fought together with Matsudaira Ietada, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Ii Naomasa as they all climbed the Tanaka castle wall engaging Nobutatsu&#x27;s soldiers.

Among those who has assigned the commands of the former Takeda samurais was Honda Tadakatsu, who received a command over 60 members of Asari clan led by Asari Masatane.

=== After Nobunaga&#x27;s death ===
In 1582, after the Honnō-ji Incident, Tadakatsu accompanied Ieyasu in an arduous journey to escape the enemies of Nobunaga in Sakai and returning to Mikawa. However, their journey were very dangerous due to the existence of &quot;Ochimusha-gari&quot; groups across the route. During this journey, Tadakatsu and other senior Ieyasu retainers such as Sakai Tadatsugu and Ii Naomasa fought their way out against the raids and harassments from Ochimusha-gari outlaws (Samurai hunters) during their march escorting Ieyasu, while sometimes also paying bribes of gold and silver to the Ochimusha-gari gangs which they could bribe. Arthur Lindsay Sadler said that Tadakatsu was &quot;repelling the bandits&quot; often during this journey. As they reached Kada, an area between Kameyama town and Iga, the attacks from Ochimusha-gari finally ended as they reached the territory of Kōka ikki clans of Jizamurai who were friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ikki samurai were helping them killing members of the Ochimusha-gari and then escorting them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by samurai clans from Iga ikki which accompany the Ieyasu group until they safely reached Mikawa. The &quot;Ietada nikki&quot; journal has recorded that the escorts of Ieyasu has suffered around 200 casualties and only 34 person left when they finally arrived at Ietada residence in Mikawa.

In 1584, Tadakatsu participated in the Komaki Campaign of Tokugawa against Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During this conflict, Tadakatsu entered negotiation with the Akai clan, a samurai clan from Tanba Province, which led by Ashida Tokinao, younger brother of Akai Naomasa, as Tokinao aspired for the revival of the Akai clan by contributing with Tokugawa clan. Tokinao then raised an army in Tanba on Ieyasu&#x27;s side. As Tadakatsu was stationed Komaki while Ieyasu departed to engage Toyotomi troops at Nagakute, Tadakatsu observed a huge host under Hideyoshi himself move out in pursuit. With a handful of men, Tadakatsu rode out and challenged the Toyotomi army from the opposite bank of the Shōnai River. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was said to have been impressed by Tadakatsu and commanded his army to not attack the small units of Tadakatsu. After the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, the front line in northern Owari reached stalemate. Ieyasu and Oda Nobukatsu led 20,000 soldiers and besieged three castles: Kanie Castle, Maeda Castle, and Shimoichiba Castle. The Kanie castle were defended by Maeda Nagatane and Takigawa Kazumasu.

The soldiers led by Tadatsugu, While Tadakatsu, Ishikawa Kazumasa, Ii Naomasa, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Matsudaira Ietada deployed in reserve before entering the battle with Ieyasu himself. On June 23, Ieyasu entered the castle with Sakakibara Yasumasa, thus the castle were subdued.

=== Famed Four Tokugawa&#x27;s Guardians under Toyotomi Regency ===
on November 13, 1585, Ishikawa Kazumasa defected from Ieyasu to Hideyoshi. This accident caused Ieyasu to undergone massive reforms of the structures of Tokugawa clan military government. At first, Ieyasu ordered Torii Mototada, who served as the county magistrate of Kai, to collect military laws, weapons, and military equipment from the time of Takeda Shingen and bring them to Hamamatsu Castle (Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture). Later, he also appointed two former Takeda vassals, Naruse Masakazu and Okabe Masatsuna, as magistrates under authority of Ii Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu, while he also ordered all of former Takeda vassals who now serve him to impart any military doctrines and structures they knew during their service under Takeda clan, and lastly, he ordered the three of his prime generals, the so-called &quot;Tokugawa Four Heavenly Kings,&quot; Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and Sakakibara Yasumasa, to serve as supreme commander of this new military regiments.

In 1586, according to &quot;Sakakibara clan historical records&quot;, Ieyasu sent Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and Ii Naomasa as representatives to Kyoto, where three of them being regarded as &quot;Tokugawa Sanketsu&quot;(Three great nobles of Tokugawa). Then in following month, the three of them joined by Sakai Tadatsugu to accompany Ieyasu in his personal trip to Kyoto, where the four of them became famous as &quot;Four Tokugawa Guardians&quot;. Tadakatsu also rewarded with several ranks promotion here. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu participated in Hideyoshi Toyotomi campaign against Hōjō clan and sent Tadakatsu, Torii Mototada, Hiraiwa Chikayoshi, and his other vassals to command the Tokugawa army to subdue various branches of castles controlled by the Hōjō clan. Tadakatsu and Sakai Ietsugu captured Sakura Castle and fought against the Chiba clan, allies of the Hōjō in Shimōsa Province. Tadakatsu besieged Tamanawa Castle which defended by Hōjō Ujikatsu, until it fallen in April 21 and forcing Ujikatsu to abandon the castle. In May 19, Tadakatsu, Torii Mototada, Hiraiwa Chikayoshi, and Kawakubo Nobutoshi, joined with Asano Nagamasa and Shigeka, forming 20,000 strong advance troops besieging Iwatsuki Castle. The forces of Honda clan under Tadakatsu&#x27;s vassal, Kaji Masamichi, entered the castle and then go up to the top floor, where Masamichi raised a black flag to the outside to signalling their allies to follow suit entering the castle. Iwatsuki castle has fallen in May 22. In May 14, Tokugawa troops detachment under Tadakatsu, Shimada Toshimasa, and Torii Mototada were attaching themselves to the Toyotomi army besieging Hachigata Castle, with total strength of 35,000. On June 13, When Tadakatsu was deployed under Asano Nagamasa, he carried a cannon up a nearby mountain and began firing it into the castle, which causing severe damage to the castle, prompting its defender, Ujikuni, surrendered the castle in exchange for sparing the lives of the castle&#x27;s soldiers. the castle fallen in June 14. During this campaign, Tadakatsu also subdued Mangi Castle, which he temporarily settled in.

Later in the same year, when Ieyasu was transferred to the Kantō region, Ieyasu promoted him from &quot;daimyō&quot;/lord of the Ōtaki Domain ( &quot;koku&quot;) in Isumi District, Kazusa Province, to the Kuwana Domain ( &quot;koku&quot;) as a reward for his service. In addition, his son Honda Tadatomo became daimyo of Ōtaki. It was said the reason why Ieyasu placed Tadakatsu far from Edo was due to Ieyasu&#x27;s policy of placing his Fudai daimyō on the borders in anticipation of potential enemy invasion. Yasumasa was preparing against the Sanada clan and Uesugi clan in the north, while Tadakatsu was prepared to anticipate potential aggression from the Satomi clan in Awa Province.

In 1591, after one year settling in Mangi castle, Tadakatsu move into Otaki Castle. Later, Ieyasu Tokugawa brought Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Ii Naomasa to participate in the suppression of Kunohe rebellion.

=== Sekigahara campaign ===
In 1600, Tadakatsu had a major role in the Tokugawa campaign against Ishida Mitsunari faction. Before the start of the conflict, Tadakatsu also played diplomatic role as he entered negotiation with Katō Sadayasu, daimyo of Hōki Province, and swayed him to side with Tokugawa faction.

On August 21, The Eastern army alliance which sided with Ieyasu Tokugawa attacked Takegahana castle which defended by Oda Hidenobu, who sides with Mitsunari faction. They split themselves into two groups, where 18,000 soldiers led by Ikeda Terumasa and Asano Yoshinaga went to the river crossing, while 16,000 soldiers led by Naomasa, Fukushima Masanori, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Kyogoku Kochi, Kuroda Nagamasa, Katō Yoshiaki, Tōdō Takatora, Tanaka Yoshimasa, and Honda Tadakatsu went downstream at Ichinomiya. The first group led by Terumasa crossed the Kiso River and engaged in a battle at Yoneno, causing the Hidenobu army routed. On the other hand, Takegahana castle were reinforced by a Western army faction&#x27;s general named Sugiura Shigekatsu. The Eastern army led by Naomasa and Fukushima crossed the river and directly attacked Takegahana Castle at 9:00 AM on the August 22nd. Shigekatsu himself setting the castle on fire and committed suicide as a final act of defiance.

On September 29, Tadakatsu and Masanori led their army to rendezvous with Ikeda Terumasa army, where they engaged Oda Hidenobu army in the Battle of Gifu Castle. crossing a river near Hagiwara and Ogoe town, and approached the Gifu Castle with total 35,000 soldiers. In this battle, Hidenobu castle were deprived the expected support from Ishikawa Sadakiyo (石川貞清), who decided to not help the Western army in this war after he made an agreement with Naomasa. Hidenobu was prepared to commit seppuku, but was persuaded by Ikeda Terumasa and others to surrender to the eastern forces, and the Gifu Castle fell.

In October, Tadakatsu participated in the Battle of Kuisegawa. At first, two Tokugawa generals Nakamura Kazuhide and Arima Toyouji fell into a trap of ambush from the flanks as they were pursuing the fleeing Western Army officers Shima Sakon and Akashi Teruzumi. However, the timely intervention of Tadakatsu gave space for Kazuhide and Toyouji to escape from Sakon aggression, and Tadakatsu managed to halt the western army from pursuing his comrades.

Later, Honda Tadakatsu participated at the Battle of Sekigahara as one of Eastern army commander. At some point during this battle, Tadakatsu rode his horse, &quot;Migoku-Kuro&quot;, to penetrate the ranks of the camps of Shimazu Yoshihiro and Ukita Hideie, two of Western Army commanders. However, Tadakatsu&#x27;s beloved horse Migoku-Kuro was shot (or, according to one theory, hit by an arrow) during this moment, forcing Tadakatsu to desperately fought in the middle of by enemy soldiers encirclement, until his senior vassal, Katsutada Kaji, immediately came to his rescue and offered his horse to Tadakatsu from being surrounded by the enemies. Ōta Gyūichi chronicles of &quot;Daifu-Kō gunki&quot; has recorded, after several western army generals such as Ōtani Yoshitsugu and Shima Sakon along with his son were slain in the battle, Tadakatsu units surging forward against the western army unimpeded until reached Nakasuji, causing the western army to rout and flee down to the Tamafuji River.

After the victory of Ieyasu forces in Sekigahara, Ieyasu rewarded Tadakatsu with domain increase of 150,000 koku. However, Tadakatsu refused this promotion, so Ieyasu instead assigned reward of 50,000 to Tadakatsu&#x27;s son instead. Tadakatsu and Ii Naomasa engaged in peace agreement with Mōri Terumoto. Itazaka Bokusai (1578－1655), personal physician of Tokugawa Ieyasu, has recorded a memorial from anonymous soldier from Sekigahara in his work, &quot;Keichō Chronicle&quot;, that after Ishida Mitsunari was caught and brought in to be executed, Tadakatsu came close while bowed politely towards Mitsunari, and saying &quot;Lord Mitsunari has made a mistake&quot;.

=== Retirement &amp; death ===
In 1609, Tadakatsu retired, and his other son Tadamasa took over the position of the head of Honda clan. Tadakatsu&#x27;s daughter, Komatsuhime was Sanada Nobuyuki&#x27;s lawful wife and mother of Sanada Nobumasa, daimyō of Matsushiro Domain. His grandson, Tadatoki, married the granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Senhime. Despite his years of loyal service, Tadakatsu became increasingly estranged from the Tokugawa shogunate (Bakufu government) as it evolved from a military to a civilian political institution. This was a fate shared by many other warriors of the time, who were not able to make the conversion from the chaotic lifetime of warfare of the Sengoku period to the more stable peace of the Tokugawa shogunate.

<text>Wilhelm von Christ (2 August 1831 – 8 February 1906) was a German classical scholar.

==Biography==
The son of a baker and a miller&#x27;s daughter, Christ was born in Geisenheim in Hesse-Nassau. He attended the Gymnasium in Hadamar and studied in Munich from 1850 under Karl Halm, Friedrich Thiersch, Karl von Prantl, and Leonhard Spengel, then in Berlin under Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, August Boeckh und Franz Bopp. In 1853 he received his doctorate at Berlin for a work on Aristotle and the next year he became a teacher at the in Munich. In 1860, Christ was appointed extraordinary profossor of Classical philology at the University of Munich; he became an ordinary professor in 1863. In 1891/92, he was rector of the university. He maintained a connection to secondary education as a member of the senior school council of Bavaria (1872) and of the Imperial School Commission (1890).

Christ was an extraordinary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities from 1858 and an ordinary member from 1864. He published numerous articles in the Academy&#x27;s publications. From 1870, he was an honorary member of the . After receiving the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown in 1876, he was raised to the nobility as &quot;Ritter von Christ&quot;. In 1893, he was named as an ordinary member of the German Archaeological Institute. In 1894, he was admitted to the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art.

In 1886, Wilhelm Christ was the first to put forward the theory that the Sea Peoples were identical with Plato&#x27;s Atlanteans. Later, this thesis was repeated with variations by scholars and researchers such as Theodor Gomperz, Spyridon Marinatos, Jürgen Spanuth, John V. Luce, and Herwig Görgemanns.

<text>Ludwig Friedrich Otto Baumgarten-Crusius (31 July 1788 – 31 May 1843) was a German Protestant theologian and divine born in Merseburg. He was the brother of philologist Detlev Karl Wilhelm Baumgarten-Crusius (1786-1845).

==Life==
In 1805 he entered the University of Leipzig, where he studied theology and philology, becoming a university minister in 1810. In 1812 he became an associate professor of theology at the University of Jena, where in 1817, he attained a full professorship. He would remain at Jena for the rest of his life.

He was considered a champion of religious liberty, a theme that was expressed throughout his various writings. Early in his career, he was influenced by the metaphysics of Schelling, a belief system that he ultimately abandoned as his career progressed.

With the exception of church history, he lectured on all branches of so-called theoretical theology, especially on New Testament exegesis, Biblical theology, dogmatic ethics, and the history of dogma. His comprehensive knowledge, accurate scholarship and wide sympathies gave unusual value to his lectures and treatises, especially those on the development of church doctrine.

== Literary works ==
His published works are many, the most important being:
* &quot;Einleitung in die Dogmatik&quot;, Leipzig 1820 - Introduction to dogmatics.
* &quot;Lehrbuch der christlichen Sittenlehre&quot;, Leipzig 1826 - Textbook of Christian ethics.
* &quot;Grundzuge der biblischen Theologie&quot;, Jena 1828 - Basics of Biblical theology.
* &quot;Compendium der Dogmengeschichte&quot;, (Leipzig 1840-1846; second part edited by Karl Hase) - Compendium for the history of dogma.

<text>Viola Dana (born Virginia Flugrath; June 26, 1897 – July 3, 1987) was an American film actress who was successful during the era of silent films. She appeared in over 100 films, but was unable to make the transition to sound films.

==Early life==
Born Virginia Flugrath on June 26, 1897, in Brooklyn, New York City, where she was raised, she was the middle sister of three siblings who all became actresses. Her sisters were known as Edna Flugrath and Shirley Mason. Dana appeared (billed as Viola Dana) in the Broadway play &quot;The Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; by Eleanor Gates.

She began performing in vaudeville with Dustin Farnum in &quot;The Little Rebel&quot; and played a bit part in &quot;The Model&quot; by Augustus Thomas.

==Film career==

With the stage name of Viola Dana, she entered films in 1910, including &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1910). Her first motion picture was made at a former Manhattan (New York) riding academy on West 61st Street. The stalls had been transformed to dressing rooms. Dana became a star with the Edison Manufacturing Company, working at their studio in the Bronx. She fell in love with Edison director John Hancock Collins, and they married in 1915. Dana&#x27;s success in Collins&#x27;s Edison features such as &quot;Children of Eve&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Cossack Whip&quot; (1916) encouraged producer B.A. Rolfe to offer the couple lucrative contracts with his company, Rolfe Photoplays, which was released through Metro Pictures Corporation. Dana and Collins accepted Rolfe&#x27;s offer in 1916 and made several films for Rolfe/Metro, notably &quot;The Girl Without a Soul&quot; and &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; (both 1917). Rolfe closed his New York-area studio in the face of the 1918 flu pandemic and sent most of his personnel to California. Dana left before Collins, who was finishing work at the studio; however, Collins contracted influenza and died in a New York hotel room on October 23, 1918. 

Dana remained in California acting for Metro throughout the 1920s, but her popularity gradually waned. One of her latter roles was in Frank Capra&#x27;s first film for Columbia Pictures, &quot;That Certain Thing&quot; (1928). She retired from the screen in 1929. Her final screen credits are roles in &quot;Two Sisters&quot; (1929), &quot;One Splendid Hour&quot; (1929), and with her sister Leonie Flugrath, better known as Shirley Mason (years earlier she had appeared with her older sister, Edna Flugrath, in the 1923 film &quot;The Social Code&quot;), in &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929). By the time she made her final film appearance in 1933, she had appeared in over 100 films. She briefly came out of retirement to appear in her first and only television role in a small part on &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; in 1956.

More than 50 years after her retirement from the screen, Dana appeared in the Kevin Brownlow/David Gill documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980), discussing her career as a silent film star during the 1920s. Footage from the interview was used in the later documentary series &quot;Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow&quot; (1987) from the same team.

==Personal life==
Dana&#x27;s first husband was Edison director John Collins who died in the influenza pandemic of 1918. In 1920, she began a relationship with Ormer &quot;Lock&quot; Locklear, an aviator, military veteran and budding film star. Locklear died when his aircraft crashed on August 2, 1920, during a nighttime film shoot for &quot;The Skywayman&quot;. Although married, Locklear had been dating Dana, and on the night before his death, in a premonition, gave her some of his personal effects. Dana witnessed the 1920 crash and did not fly again for 25 years.

Locklear was reputed to be the prototype for the character of Waldo Pepper played by Robert Redford in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975). Dana was an honored guest at its premiere.

Dana was married to Yale football star and actor Maurice &quot;Lefty&quot; Flynn in June 1925. They divorced in February 1929. Her third and final marriage was to golfer Jimmy Thomson from 1930 to March 1945. In later years, she volunteered at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital, and she moved there permanently in 1979. In 1986, one year before her death, she was the subject of a documentary short by Anthony Slide titled &quot;Vi: Portrait of a Silent Star,&quot; in which she talks of her life and career.

==Death==
Dana died on July 3, 1987, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles at the age of 90. 

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Dana has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Olive Eleanor Boardman (August 19, 1898 – December 12, 1991) was an American film actress of the silent era.

==Early life and career==
Olive Eleanor Boardman was born on August 19, 1898, the youngest child of George W. Boardman and Janice Merriam &quot;Jennie&quot; Stockman Boardman. She had two older sisters named Merriam and Esther. In 1920, she was working as a contractor.

Educated in Philadelphia, Boardman originally acted on stage, but she lost her voice while starring in &quot;The National Anthem&quot;. She then entered a nationwide contest for new actors and actresses for silent films. She was chosen from among 1,000 competitors by Goldwyn Pictures as their &quot;New Face of 1922&quot;. Her initial screen test was unsuccessful, but a second test resulted in a contract. After several successful supporting roles, she played the lead in &quot;Souls for Sale&quot; in 1923. That same year, Boardman&#x27;s growing popularity was reflected by her inclusion on the list of WAMPAS Baby Stars. 

She appeared in more than 30 films during her career, including director King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;The Crowd&quot; (1928). Her performance in that film is widely recognized as one of the outstanding performances in American silent film. In 1932, after some success in sound films, she parted ways with MGM. Her final film was &quot;The Three Cornered Hat&quot;, which was made in Spain in 1935. After that production, she retired from acting and retreated from Hollywood. Her last appearances were in an interview filmed for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill&#x27;s British documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980) and the series MGM: When the Lion Roars (1992).

==Personal life==
Boardman was married to film director King Vidor, with whom she had two daughters, Antonia and Belinda. They married in 1926 and were divorced on April 11, 1933. Fellow actors John Gilbert and Greta Garbo had allegedly planned a double wedding with them, but Garbo broke the plans at the last minute.

On May 23, 1929, a federal grand jury returned an indictment that charged Boardman with evading income tax payments in 1925, 1926, and 1927. Simultaneously, an information filed in federal court accused Vidor of income tax evasion in 1925 and 1926. J. Marjorie Berger, an income tax counselor in Hollywood, had earlier been indicted on charges of preparing a false income tax return for the couple for 1925.

Boardman&#x27;s second husband was Harry d&#x27;Abbadie d&#x27;Arrast, to whom she was married from 1940. She divided her time between the United States and their chateau in the Pyrenees Mountains. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1968, she permanently relocated to the United States, where she settled into Montecito, California, living in a house she designed.

==Death==
Boardman died in her sleep at her Santa Barbara, California, home on December 12, 1991, at the age of 93. Her ashes were scattered in Santa Barbara near her home.

== Recognition ==
For her contributions to the film industry, Boardman has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her star is located at 6928 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Heather Marguerita Small (born 20 January 1965) is a British soul singer and lead vocalist of the band M People. Her subsequent debut solo studio album, &quot;Proud&quot;, was released in 2000. Her second and third studio albums &quot;Close to a Miracle&quot; and &quot;Colour My Life&quot; were released in 2006 and 2022, respectively.

==Early life==
Small was born in London and raised on a council estate in Ladbroke Grove, West London.

==Career==

===1987–1998: Hot House and M People===
Small joined her first group, Hot House, as a singer while she was still a teenager. She was the studio singer voice of the re-recorded version of &quot;Ride on Time&quot; by Black Box. She had a chance meeting with Manchester DJ, Mike Pickering, formerly of Quando Quango, which led to sales of over 10 million albums worldwide with the group M People. They had considerable success with songs such as &quot;Moving On Up&quot;, &quot;One Night in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Search for the Hero&quot;.

In 1997, Small performed in &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, the official 1997 Children in Need charity release, alongside a broad range of artists, including Tom Jones and Lou Reed. It sold over a million copies and was the UK&#x27;s number one single for three weeks.

In 1998, Small and M People took some time off to pursue solo projects after &quot;The Best of M People&quot; was released.

===2000–2005: &quot;Proud&quot;===
In 2000, Small released her debut solo album, &quot;Proud&quot;, and a single of the same name, closely affiliated with the British Olympic team of the time. The single, which was used for the first season and the last episode of the final season of &quot;Queer as Folk,&quot; is Small&#x27;s signature song, with which she achieved international success. When Oprah Winfrey was looking for a song to sum up the work she had been striving to achieve over her twenty-year career, she contacted Small, and &quot;Proud&quot; became the theme song to &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;; in 2005, Small made her American television debut on the show. Later the same year, &quot;Proud&quot; became the theme song for the American reality weight-loss show &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;.

&quot;Holding On&quot; was released as the next single, followed in November 2000 by a duet single with Tom Jones, called &quot;You Need Love Like I Do&quot;.

Small took time off to look after her newborn son, and record her second solo album. She occasionally appeared on various TV programs such as &quot;Parkinson&quot; and &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. She also sang three songs at the Tsunami Relief Concert at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

In 2005, a second M People greatest hits collection, &quot;Ultimate Collection,&quot; was released. The record featured both the biggest M People hits and two of Small&#x27;s solo singles. &quot;Proud&quot; was re-released from this album and reached number 33 on the UK Singles Charts. M People reunited and played together on an arena tour in 2005, and they have played a few times each year afterwards.

===2006–2008: &quot;Close to a Miracle&quot;===
Small released a new single, &quot;Radio On&quot;, in the UK on 17 July 2006. Her second solo album, &quot;Close to a Miracle,&quot; was released on 24 July, followed by a second single of the same name released digitally on 25 September 2006. It also included a previously unreleased track, &quot;Changes&quot;. The album was a commercial disappointment—it charted for one week at number 57, and both supporting singles failed to reach the Top 100—but a short UK solo tour later in the autumn was received well.

In 2007, Small collaborated with Icelandic tenor Garðar Thór Cortes on a song called &quot;Luna&quot;. It was released as a single from his album &quot;Cortes&quot; and reached number two in the Icelandic online music charts. A new song was recorded to celebrate 200 years since the abolition of the slave trade, and Small performed at a concert in London to mark the anniversary on 10 November 2007. On 26 May 2008, Small performed alongside Stereophonics and Feeder at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as part of the celebrations of Wales&#x27;s success at the 2008 Grand Slam. In addition, Small performed three nights at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in October as part of her 2008 tour, and headlined at Manchester Pride.

On 24 August 2008, she performed at the Visa London 2012 Party to celebrate the handover as host city of the Olympic Games from Beijing, China, to London. Small sang &quot;Proud&quot;, which was the unofficial anthem of Team GB at the Athens Games in 2004, and was the official anthem of the London 2012 Games. In December 2008, she performed &quot;Proud&quot; again on the 2008 BBC Sports Personality of the Year programme, as a soundtrack to a montage of British Olympian achievements at Beijing.

===Late 2008: &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===
In 2008, Small was one of the sixteen celebrities in the sixth series of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, where she was partnered with newcomer Brian Fortuna. The couple were placed ninth overall in the series, and were in the bottom two on four occasions, in weeks 4, 5, 7, and 8. They were eventually voted off by the judges when they lost in the dance-off against Rachel Stevens. Small also appeared in an associated BBC Three series called &quot;Dancing on Wheels&quot;.

===2009–present===

From late 2008 and throughout 2009, Small toured the UK. The setlist included Small&#x27;s solo tracks, M People songs, and some jazz covers.

It was announced in July 2010 that Small would take Chaka Khan&#x27;s place alongside Anastacia and Lulu for the second Here Come the Girls tour, which took place across the UK during November and December 2010. On 20 October 2010, she was rewarded with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of her contribution to music.

In April 2011, Small performed as half-time entertainment at London&#x27;s Twickenham Stadium for the annual St. George&#x27;s Day Premiership Rugby fixture hosted by Wasps. Performing with educational events company Pro-Excel, Small performed &quot;Proud&quot; and &quot;Search for The Hero&quot;, and led a backing dance troupe of 546 UK students, becoming the Guinness World Record Holder for &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest ever Backing Dance Troupe for a Popstar&quot;.

On 29 October 2012, Small appeared at the 2012 Pride of Britain Awards, and sang &quot;Proud&quot; as a tribute to the athletes of the London 2012 Olympic Games.

During 2017, Small participated in the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage for the BBC, along with Neil Morrissey, Debbie McGee, Ed Byrne, Kate Bottley, Raphael Rowe, and JJ Chalmers. She commented on the experience afterwards: &quot;I was a believer before I set off, but this trip made me realise my faith and beliefs were much stronger than I had realised.&quot;

In 2018, Small celebrated 25 years of singing. She toured around the UK, celebrating her and M People&#x27;s music.

Alongside the tour, Small planned to release a new album, &quot;Heather Small: Orchestral Greatest Hits&quot;, in May 2018, but on 3 May, the project was declared to be cancelled.

Small toured from 10 April to 26 April 2019.

In January 2022, Small appeared on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Chandelier&quot;. She was first to be unmasked.

==Charity work==
Small actively supports several charities, such as BeatBullying, the Aiden Cox Foundation, Mencap (for which she performed) and St Luke&#x27;s Midnight Walk. She attended an anti-racism ceremony at 10 Downing Street for &quot;Show Racism The Red Card&quot;, which was also attended by Sporting Elite, the prime minister, and others. Small works regularly with Barnardo&#x27;s; she has also become an ambassador of Asthma UK, as she suffered from asthma as a child. She has also said that she supports &quot;a few charities&quot; including the Rio Ferdinand Foundation and Greenhouse Sports.

==Personal life==
Small lives in West London. In the 1990s, she had a long-term relationship with rugby player and coach Shaun Edwards, with whom she has a son, Labour Party councillor and London Assembly member James Small-Edwards. Small lived in Standish, Greater Manchester whilst cohabiting with Edwards. In 2012 she married lawyer David Neita.

Small was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for voluntary and charitable services.

<doc id="998523" wikidata="Q337516" url="?curid=998523" title="Tekuder">
<text>Ahmed Tekuder (; ; 10 August 1284), also known as Sultan Ahmad, was the sultan of the Ilkhanate from 1282 to 1284. He was a son of Hulegu and brother of Abaqa. He was eventually succeeded by his nephew Arghun Khan.

==Early life==
Tekuder was born c. 1246 in Mongolia to Hulagu and Qutui Khatun from the Mongol Khongirad tribe as his seventh son. His birth date is not mentioned elsewhere but according to sources he died aged 37, therefore his birth year must have been around 1246 or 1247. He was baptized in his childhood as a Nestorian Christian and was given the name &quot;Nicholas&quot;. He arrived in the Ilkhanate sometime in the 1260s with his mother Qutui and brother Tekshin. Years later, he was granted governorship of Nahavand and Dinavar by Abaqa, who respected his mother Qutui. Qutui was also invested with territories with income of 100.000 gold coins near Mayyafariqin by Abaqa.

== Conversion to Islam ==
The circumstances of Tekuder&#x27;s conversion to Islam are unknown. However, according to Ibn al-Fuwati he had been given information about his religious mentor and perhaps the person responsible for Tekuder&#x27;s conversion - Kamal al-Din Abd ul-Rahman. He was described as a Greek slave of al-Musta&#x27;sim Billah, who rose in rank thanks to his skills at alchemy and met Abaqa to whom he was introduced by Aybak. Abd ul-Rahman was introduced to Tekuder later by his mother Qutui Khatun. Tekuder sometime later converted to Islam and changed his name to &quot;Ahmed, w&quot;hile Abd ul-Rahman would later rise in court and eventually be an ambassador to Mamluk Egypt.
== Election and reign ==
He arrived to the Jaghatu valley near Maragha to attend the qurultai for the election of new Il-Khan after Abaqa&#x27;s death in April 1282. The main competition was between his nephew Arghun, his brother Möngke-Temür, and himself. He was supported by most of the nobles and emirs, including Jalairs such as Shiktur Noyan, Suqunjaq Noyan and the Khongirads. He was elected on 6 May 1282 and enthroned on 21 June 1282 at Aladagh (), east of lake Van. He adopted his Muslim name Ahmed as his regnal name.

His first act was to clear Ata-Malik Juvayni of charges brought against him by Majd al-Mulk Yazdi, a vizier who accused him of embezzling state funds. Tekuder restored him to the government of Baghdad, while people lynched Majd al-Mulk for witchcraft. He also appointed his younger half-brother, Qonqurtai, as viceroy of Anatolia the following month. However Arghun believed that the Juvayni brothers were responsible for his father&#x27;s death by poisoning. He came to Baghdad to spend the winter of 1282-1283 and restarted the investigation of the accusations of embezzlement which may have caused Ata Malik&#x27;s stroke on 5 March 1283.

=== Rivalry with Arghun ===
As Arghun&#x27;s dissatisfaction grew, he left for Khorasan in spring to gain the allegiance of minor nobles and amirs. Tekuder on the other hand began to be suspicious of his half-brother Qonqurtai and Arghun&#x27;s potential alliance. Qonqurtai was accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tekuder&#x27;s son-in-law, Alinaq Noyan - the viceroy of Georgia - on 17 January 1284, and was executed the next day. An army contingent was sent to Jazira, from where Gaykhatu and Baydu fled to Khorasan, to Arghun&#x27;s encampment while several emirs such as Taghachar and Doladai were arrested.

His next step was to send Alinaq with 15,000 men against Arghun, while he himself followed Alinaq on 26 April with his main army composed of Armenians and Georgians in addition to Mongols stationed in Mughan plain near Bilasuvar. Arghun prevailed against Alinaq in battle on 4 May, south of Qazvin, but nevertheless retreated to his lands in Khorasan. Ala ud-Daula Simnani, future Sufi saint of Kubrawiya order also fought in Arghun&#x27;s army during this battle. Arghun tried negotiate a truce, which Ahmad, against the advice of his councillors, refused. Another embassy sent by Arghun, this time led by his son Ghazan arrived at Tekuder&#x27;s camp near Semnan on 31 May. The embassy was a success, as Ahmad accepted a truce on the condition that Arghun send his brother Gaykhatu as a hostage. Arghun agreed to the terms and sent his brother accompanied by two amirs, including Nawruz into the custody of Buqa, then the most senior of Tekuder&#x27;s commanders, on 13 or 28 June. Buqa in turn handed him over to Ahmad who put Gaykhatu in Tödai Khatun&#x27;s encampment.

Despite this, Tekuder continued hostilities and continued to advance on Arghun. This caused Buqa to harbour resentment towards Tekuder and to grow more sympathetic to Arghun. On the other hand, he lost the favour of Tekuder who started to invest his trust in Aq Buqa, another Jalair general.

Arghun&#x27;s next step was to seek refuge in Kalat-e Naderi, a strong fortress on 7 July with 100 men. But he was forced to surrender to Alinaq four days later. Victorious, Tekuder left Arghun in Alinaq&#x27;s custody while he himself left for Kalpush, where his main army was stationed. This was the opportunity Buqa was seeking - he broke into Alinaq&#x27;s camp and set Arghun free, while killing Alinaq. Tekuder fled west and looted Buqa&#x27;s encampment near Sultaniya in revenge. He continued on to his own pasturelands near Takht-i Suleyman on 17 July planning to escape to the Golden Horde via Derbent. However, Qaraunas, who had been sent by Buqa, soon caught up with and arrested Tekuder. He was turned over to Arghun on 26 July on the Ab-i Shur pasturelands, near Maragha.

== Trial and death ==
Tekuder was accused of the unjust execution of Qonqurtai, his half-brother in a trial presided over by Arghun. While Tekuder asked for mercy and clemency, Qonqurtai&#x27;s Chinese (or Khitan) mother Ajuja demanded his execution. While not in favour of execution, the rebellions of his uncle Hulachu and cousin Jushkab in Hamadan forced him decide in favour of Qonqurtai&#x27;s family. They had Ahmed executed on 10 August 1284 by breaking his back.
== Relations with Mamluks ==
Shams al-Din Juvayni advised him to make peace with Mamluk Egypt since he was a Muslim sultan. The first embassy headed by Qutb al-Din Shirazi left Aladagh for Egypt on 25 August 1282. He expressed his aim to forge an alliance with Qalawun against the wishes of his own council in a letter. Qalawun sent a reply on 3 December 1282 urging Tekuder to release the Sultanate of Rum from vassalage as a fellow Muslim. Tekuder sent a second embassy, headed by his religious mentor Kamal al-Din Abd ul-Rahman to Egypt from Tabriz in June 1283. However, this embassy was late as it arrived on 2 March 1284 and was granted audience on 26 August 1284, 16 days after Tekuder&#x27;s death. Which led to the envoy&#x27;s arrest and death.

When Arghun received no reply, he declared war against Tekuder. Tekuder requested help from the Mamluk Sultan, but the Mamluks did not fully co-operate with him. Having a small and inferior army, Tekuder was defeated by Arghun&#x27;s larger force, and he was eventually executed on August 10, 1284. Shams al-Din Juvayni was also arrested and executed by Buqa on 16 October 1284.

==Family==
Tekuder had eight consorts from different clans and several children with them:

* Senior wife - Töküz Khatun, a lady from the Khongirad tribe

<text>Karl Friedrich Neumann (28 December 1793 – 17 March 1870) was a German orientalist.

==Life==

Neumann was born, under the name of Bamberger, at Reichsmannsdorf, near Bamberg. He studied philosophy and philology at Heidelberg, Munich and Göttingen, became a convert to Protestantism and took the name of Neumann. From 1821 to 1825 he was a teacher in Würzburg and Speyer; then he learned Armenian in Venice at the San Lazzaro degli Armeni and visited Paris and London.

In 1829 he went to China, where he studied the language and amassed a large library of valuable books and manuscripts. These, about 12,000 in number, he presented to the royal library at Munich. Returning to Germany in 1833, Neumann was made professor of Armenian and Chinese in the university of Munich. He held this position until 1852, when, owing to his pronounced revolutionary opinions, he was removed from his chair. Ten years later he settled in Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1870.

==Works==
Neumann&#x27;s leisure time after his enforced retirement was occupied in historical studies, and besides his &quot;Geschichte des englischen Reichs in Asien&quot; (Leipzig, 1857, 2 volumes), he wrote a history of the United States of America, &quot;Geschichte der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika&quot; (Berlin, 1863–1866, 3 volumes).

His other works include:
*&quot;Versuch einer Geschichte der armenischen Literatur&quot; (Leipzig, 1836)
*&quot;Die Völker des südlichen Russland&quot; (1846, and again 1855)
*&quot;Geschichte des englisch-chinesischen Kriegs&quot; (1846, and again 1855)
He also issued some translations from Chinese and Armenian:
*&quot;The Catechism of the shamans, or, The laws and regulations of the priesthood of Buddha in China&quot; (1831).
*&quot;Vahram&#x27;s Chronicle of the Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia, during the time of the Crusades&quot; (1831); translation of Vahram of Edessa (fl. c. 1303–1330).
*&quot;History of the pirates who infested the China Sea from 1807 to 1810&quot; (1831).

The journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (London, 1871) contains a full list of his works.

<doc id="998529" wikidata="Q1008165" url="?curid=998529" title="Garai family">
<text>The House of Garay or Garai () was a Hungarian-Croatian noble family, a branch of the Dorozsma (Durusma) clan, with notable members in the 14th and 15th centuries. They were lords of Csesznek.

== Origin ==

The family was descended from the Dorozsma kindred. Béla, Duke of Slavonia, granted the eponymous domain of Gara in Valkó County (now Gorjani in Croatia) to &quot;Comes&quot; John and his brother, Stephen, in 1269. The charter of grant mentioned that Stephen was the duke&#x27;s swordbearer. Stephen&#x27;s sons, Andrew and Paul, were the ancestors of the two branches of the family.

Andrew, the founder of the &quot;Palatine&quot; branch, did not hold offices. He married an unnamed daughter of Ladislaus Nevnai and Yolanda Kórógyi. Nevnai held estates in Valkó and Pozsega Counties. Andrew fathered two sons, Nicholas and Paul, but the latter died young. Their maternal grandmother bequeathed her estates in Baranya County to them.

Andrew&#x27;s brother, Paul, founded the &quot;Bánfi&quot; branch of the family.

== Notable members ==

=== &quot;Palatine&quot; branch ===

Nicholas I Garai (Croatian: Nikola I Gorjanski, Hungarian: Garai Miklós I), the chief governor of Pressburg, was a palatine to the King of Hungary (1375–1385). He was killed in 1386.
*Nicholas I&#x27;s first son John Garai (Ivan Gorjanski, Garai János; 1371–1429) was the governor of Temesiensis and Pozsega banates. John&#x27;s daughter, Dorothy Garai, was Queen of Bosnia as spouse of King Tvrtko II of Bosnia.
**Nicholas I&#x27;s second son Nicholas II Garai (Nikola II Gorjanski, Garai Miklós II; 1367–1433) was Palatine to the King of Hungary (1402–1433) ban of Macsó, Usora, Soli, Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia, and married to Theodora (Helen), daughter of Serbian Prince Lazar. In 1396 he fought the Ottomans in the Battle of Nicopolis which was lost due to others&#x27; errors. In 1416 Sigismund extended their armorial bearings showing the Order of the Dragon and the Order of the Scarf. He presented the patent to his brother-in-law Garai Miklós. Nicholas II&#x27;s granddaughter Anna was engaged to Matthias Corvinus.
***Nicholas II&#x27;s son, Ladislaus Garai (1410–1459) was a Palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary (1447–1458). Based on an agreement with the Hunyadi family he originally supported Matthias Hunyadi as king. Later when Hunyadi did not keep the bargain the barons of the Garai party opposed Matthias Hunyadi. Nor did he marry Anna.
**Nicholas I also married his daughters well: Ilona was married to the magnate Nicholas II Szécsi, Elizabeth married Simon Szécsényi and Dorothea married Nicholas Frankopan, ban of Croatia and Dalmatia.

=== &quot;Bánfi&quot; branch ===
*Nicholas I&#x27;s uncle, Paul I Garai (Croatian: Pavao Gorjanski, Hungarian: Garai Pál, Serbian: Pavle Gorjanski; 1280–1353), was also a ban of Macsó. His successors to this position were his son-in-law John Alsáni and his grandson Paul Alsáni.
**Paul&#x27;s son, Paul Bánfi de Gara (died in 1377/80) was the governor of Zala County.
**Paul&#x27;s other son, Stephen Bánfi de Gara (died in 1346/47) was also the governor of Zala.
***Stephen&#x27;s son, Paul Bánfi de Gara (died in 1386) was the governor of Zala as well.
****Paul&#x27;s son, Dezső Bánfi de Gara (died in 1437/40) was a ban of Macsó.

<text>Garai (in Basque and officially, in Spanish &quot;Garay&quot;) is an elizate, town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain. Garai is part of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Durangaldea and has a population of 318 inhabitants as of 2009 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.

== Toponymy ==
The complete name of the elizate was &quot;San Miguel de Garay&quot;, but the municipality was named just &quot;Garay&quot;. The name may have two different origins; one due its geographical location, as Garai is located in the upper area of Durangaldea and &quot;garai&quot; is the Basque word for &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;the upper part&quot;; but also, the name might be related to the hórreos, very common in this area of Biscay and that have the Basque name of &quot;garaidxe&quot;. Then, &quot;San Miguel de Garay&quot; could be translated as &quot;San Miguel of the upper part&quot; of &quot;San Miguel of the hórreos&quot;.

Traditionally, the name of the town has been written as &quot;Garay&quot;, but according to the new orthographic rules of the Basque language, the correct spelling is &quot;Garai&quot;. In the 1990s, the town hall changed the official denomination from &quot;Garay&quot; to &quot;Garai&quot;.

== History ==
As happens with most of the elizates, the origin and date of foundation of the town is unknown. As a member of the ancient merindad of Durango, it had voice and right to vote in the Juntas of Guerendiaga, where it occupied the seat number six. The town was divided into two neighborhoods and it was focused on farming activities; production of corn, wheat, several sorts of vegetables, legumes, cherries, apples and chestnuts.

In the oldest part of the town is located a small palace-baserri named &quot;Garatikua&quot; and built by Juan de Garay, governor of Paraguay. In the 19th century, it was called &quot;Garay-Goitia&quot;.

On May 1, 1966, the terrorist-separatist organization ETA occupied the town for several hours in one of its first official actions. The telephone lines were shut down, several graffities were made and the Ikurriña (at that time, illegal) was set on a visible part of the town. The command abandoned the town before the arriving of the Civil Guard.

== Geography ==
Garai is located in the eastern part of the province of Biscay, in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Durangaldea, northern Spain. It has an extension of 7,12 km2. It limits at north and east with Berriz, at south with Abadiño and at west with Iurreta.

<doc id="998535" wikidata="Q5154401" url="?curid=998535" title="Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Red Flag">
<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Red Flag (CPI(ML) Red Flag) was a political party in India 1988-2005. 

The party emerged in 1988, following a split in the K. Venu-led Central Reorganisation Committee, CPI(ML) in the wake of the 1987 second conference of CRC, CPI(ML) as a large section of the latter organisation in Kerala broke away and formed its own party. The Andhra Pradesh-based group of Raouf (which had been part of the CRC, CPI(ML) as well) joined the CPI(ML) Red Flag. CPI(ML) Red Flag differed from other ML factions by claiming that India was a &#x27;neo-colony&#x27;. It upheld Marxism-Leninism Mao Tse-Tung Thought as its ideological line, and rejected the term &#x27;Maoism&#x27; whilst they also rejected the Three Worlds Theory. In contrast to K. Venu, CPI(ML) Red Flag upheld the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat rather than K. Venu&#x27;s concept on the national question. The party argued that armed struggle required to be substantiated by mass organizations. In its early phase (1988-1992) the CPI(ML) Red Flag sought to promote unity among communist revolutionary groups, and organized seminars and published open theoretical journals on Leninist polemics. Eventually the party exited its underground existence and began operating openly. 

The CPI(ML) Red Flag main base of support was in Kerala, where it emerged as the major ML faction. It also expanded to other states including Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Odisha. The party head office was located in Delhi.

The first All India Secretary of the party was Arup Majumdar, followed by K.N. Ramachandran, Souren Bose was one top leader from the original CPI (ML) to have joined this party. Bose became the West Bengal State Committee of CPI(ML) Red Flag. He died in 1997 while on a party tour in Mumbai. 

The main mass organisation of the party was the Trade Union Centre of India (TUCI). Regional mass organisations of the party included Yuvajanavedi, Kerala Vidyarthi Sanghatana (Kerala Students Organisation, a student&#x27;s wing) and Janakeeya Kala Sahitya Vedi (a cultural front) in Kerala, and Adivasi Democratic Front in Madhya Pradesh. CPI(ML) Red Flag published Red Star (English), &quot;Iykya Horatta&quot; (Kannada) and &quot;Saghavu&quot; (Malayalam).

==2003 split==
In 2003 a large section of the party in Kerala, including the majority in the Kerala State Committee, broke away, and to create a parallel CPI(ML) Red Flag. The split was led by the Kerala state secretary of the party, P.C. Unnichekkan. That party continued to use the name CPI(ML) Red Flag and supported Left Democratic Front in Kerala.

==Unification with Sanyal group==
Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2004 the K.N. Ramachandran-led CPI(ML) Red Flag and CPI (ML) took the initiative to form a united front of revolutionary communists. In that front they were able to gather, more than CPI (ML) and CPI (ML) Red Flag, Centre of Communist Revolutionaries (West Bengal), Lal Nishan Party (Leninvadi), Marxist Communist Party of India, Marxist-Leninist Committee, New Socialist Movement, Gujarat, Provisional Central Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and Bhagat Singh Vichar Manch. 

In Kerala a Left Front was formed ahead of the elections together with BTR-EMS-AKG Janakeeya Samskarika Vedi of V.B. Cheriyan.

CPI (ML) Red Flag merged with Kanu Sanyal&#x27;s Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) at a unity conference in Vijayawada January 2005

<doc id="998540" wikidata="Q316083" url="?curid=998540" title="William of Rubruck">
<text>William of Rubruck (; ; ) or Guillaume de Rubrouck was a Flemish Franciscan missionary and explorer.

He is best known for his travels to various parts of the Middle East and Central Asia in the 13th century, including the Mongol Empire. His account of his travels is one of the masterpieces of medieval travel literature, comparable to those of Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta.

==Mission==

William was born in Rubrouck, Flanders. In 1248, he accompanied King Louis IX of France on the Seventh Crusade. On 7 May 1253, on Louis&#x27; orders, he set out on a missionary journey to convert the Tatars to Christianity. He first stopped in Constantinople to confer with Baldwin of Hainaut, who had recently returned from a trip to Karakorum, the capital of the Mongol Empire, on behalf of Baldwin II, Latin Emperor. There, William received letters to some of the Tatar chiefs from the emperor.

William then followed the route of the first journey of the Hungarian Friar Julian, and in Asia that of the Italian Friar Giovanni da Pian del Carpine. With William&#x27;s party were Bartolomeo da Cremona, an attendant called Gosset, and an interpreter named in William&#x27;s report as &quot;Homo Dei&quot;, meaning &quot;man of God&quot;, perhaps representing the Arabic &quot;Abdullah&quot;, &quot;servant of God&quot;. William&#x27;s was the fourth European mission to the Mongols: previous ones had been led by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Ascelin of Lombardia in 1245 and André de Longjumeau in 1249. The King had been encouraged to send another mission by reports of the presence of Nestorian Christians at the Mongolian court, but because of an earlier rebuff he declined to send a formal mission.

==Travels==
After reaching the Crimean town of Sudak, William continued his trek with oxen and carts. Nine days after crossing the Don, he met Sartaq Khan, next ruler of the Kipchak Khanate. The Khan sent William on to his father, Batu Khan, at Sarai near the Volga River. Five weeks later, after the departure from Sudak, he reached the encampment of Batu Khan, Mongol ruler of the Kipchak Khanate and Volga River region. Batu refused conversion but sent the ambassadors on to the Great Khan of the Mongols, Möngke Khan.

William and his travelling companions set off on horseback on 16 September 1253 on a journey to the court of the Great Khan at Karakorum in modern-day Mongolia. Arriving in late December they were received courteously, and he was given an audience on 4 January 1254. William&#x27;s account provided an extensive description of the city&#x27;s walls, markets and temples, and the separate quarters for Muslim and Chinese craftsmen among a surprisingly cosmopolitan population. He also visited the court of the Vastacius (Empire of Nicaea) during the feast day of Felicitas and met Nicaean envoys during his travels. Among the Europeans he encountered were the nephew of an English bishop, a woman from Lorraine who cooked William&#x27;s Easter dinner, and Guillaume Boucher, a French silversmith who was making ornaments for the Khan&#x27;s women and altars for the Nestorian Christians.

William&#x27;s party stayed at the Khan&#x27;s camp until 10 July 1254, when they began their long journey back home. After spending two weeks in late September with Batu Khan, and Christmas at Nakhchivan in present-day Azerbaijan, he and his companions reached the County of Tripoli on 15 August 1255.

==Account==

On his return, William presented to King Louis IX a very clear and precise report, entitled &quot;&quot;. William&#x27;s report is divided into 40 chapters. Chapters 1–10 relate general observations about the Mongols and their customs, while chapters 11–40 give an account of the course and the events of William&#x27;s voyage.

In the report, he described the peculiarities of the Mongol Empire as well as many geographical observations. There were also anthropological observations, such as his surprise at the presence of Islam in Inner Asia. William was critical of the Hellenic traditions he encountered among the Christians of the former Byzantine Empire, including the Nicaean celebration of a feast day for Felicitas, which he reports was known to John III Doukas Vatatzes through the alleged possession of the second half of Ovid&#x27;s incomplete Book of Days.

William also answered a long-standing question in demonstrating by his passage north of the Caspian Sea that it was an inland sea and did not flow into the Arctic Ocean; although earlier Scandinavian explorers like Ingvar the Far-Travelled had extensive knowledge of the region, William was the first to answer the question in written form.

William&#x27;s report is one of the great masterpieces of medieval geographical literature, comparable to that of Marco Polo, although they are very different. William was a good observer and an excellent writer. He asked many questions along the way and did not take folk tales and fables as literal truth. He showed a great facility with language, noting the similarities between those he encountered and those European languages he already knew.

In May 1254, during his stay among the Mongols, William entered into a famous competition at the Mongol court, as the khan encouraged a formal theological debate between the Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims, in order to determine which faith was correct, as determined by three judges, one from each faith. A Chinese person participated with William in the competition.

Roger Bacon, William&#x27;s contemporary and fellow-Franciscan, cited the traveller copiously in his &quot;Opus Majus&quot;, and described him as &quot;Brother William through whom the lord King of France sent a message to the Tartars in 1253 AD...who traveled to regions in the east and north and attached himself to the midst of these places, and wrote of the above to the illustrious king; which book I carefully read and with his permission expounded on&quot;. After Bacon, however, William&#x27;s narrative seems to have dropped out of sight until Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s 1599 publication.

Russian poet Nikolay Zabolotskiy wrote in 1958 the long poem &quot;Rubruck in Mongolia&quot; (&quot;Рубрук в Монголии&quot;).

==Editions==
The Latin text of an incomplete manuscript containing only the first 26 chapters, together with an English translation by Richard Hakluyt, was published in 1599. A critical edition of the complete Latin text prepared by the French historian Francisque Michel and the English antiquarian Thomas Wright was published in 1839. An English translation by William Woodville Rockhill, &quot;The Journey of William of Rubruk to the Eastern Parts&quot;, was published by the Hakluyt Society in 1900, and an updated translation by Peter Jackson in 1990.

<text>Daniel Georg Morhof (6 February 163930 July 1691) was a German writer and scholar.

==Bibliography==
Morhof was born at Wismar. He first studied jurisprudence and then &quot;literae humaniores&quot; at the University of Rostock, where his elegant Latin versification procured for him in 1660 the chair of poetry. In 1665 he moved to the University of Kiel as professor of eloquence and poetry; this chair he exchanged for that of history in 1673. He died at Lübeck.

Of his numerous writings, the most important are &quot;Unterricht von der deutschen Sprache und Poesie&quot; (1682), the first attempt in Germany at a systematic survey of European literature, and &quot;Polyhistor, sive de auctorum notitia et rerum commentarii&quot; (Lübeck, 1688, not completed till 1707; 4th ed., 1747), a kind of encyclopaedia of the knowledge and learning of his time.

<doc id="998559" wikidata="Q1366119" url="?curid=998559" title="San Pedro de Macorís Province">
<text>San Pedro de Macorís () is a province of the Dominican Republic, also the name of its capital city. The city is fairly active due to its proximity to the national capital of Santo Domingo and also its role in the sugar industry. The province is informally known as San Pedro, SPM or Serie 23 for the first two numbers of their Dominican identification or Cedula.

Citizens from San Pedro de Macorís are called &quot;petromacorisanos&quot;. The culture of the province shares many similarities with those of the other eastern provinces. For example, during carnival season, the &quot;diablos&quot; (devils) (Guloyas/ Buloyas) tend to wield &quot;&quot; (whips), which relates to the traditional cattle farming of the whole region.

Serie 23 is a mecca for all Dominican culture and was the home to the DR&#x27;s most famous writer, Pedro Mir. In the past years the beautiful architecture of Serie 23 has been used as a backdrop for several Hollywood feature films, such as &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; and &quot;Sugar&quot;. It often stands in for Havana, Cuba.
==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006, is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) within them:

*Consuelo
*Guayacanes
*Quisqueya
*Ramón Santana
*San José de los Llanos
**Gautier (D.M.)
**El Puerto (D.M.)
*San Pedro de Macorís

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities and municipal districts with population figures as of the 2012 census. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot; literally heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot; literally sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot; literally places) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

==Economy==
There are several &quot;&quot; (sugar mills or, literally, sugar engines) distributed in the province which handle the load of its large sugar cane plantations. This industry in turn allowed for San Pedro De Macorís to serve as the base of operations for two of the DR&#x27;s three biggest rum distilleries. Bovine cattle is another important economic asset, as it is in all of the other eastern provinces thanks to the vast &quot;Llanura Oriental&quot; (Eastern Plain). San Pedro also hosts many hotel and tourism ventures, ranging from low-tier resorts to top tier exclusive Golf and Country Clubs.

==Sports==
The province enjoys a rarely disputed reputation as the capital of Dominican baseball, providing a relatively high number of professional baseball players. Many of these players are drafted to play in the USA&#x27;s Major Leagues of Baseball, with Sammy Sosa being the most notable player from SPM in recent years (see a full list of Dominican players). Baseball players from this city often come from poor homes and use baseball as a way to earn money for their families. Many ball players from this city are major philanthropists as well.

<doc id="998563" wikidata="Q6820093" url="?curid=998563" title="Merrick and Rosso">
<text>Merrick and Rosso were an Australian comedy duo active from 1996 to 2009, composed of Merrick Watts (Merrick) and Tim Ross (Rosso). The duo began in stand up comedy, and first came together when they teamed up for what was intended to be a one-off comedy show in 1996. They are best known for their syndicated radio programs, TV shows, stand up comedy tours, comedy DVDs and books.

==Radio program==
Merrick and Rosso first came to prominence on radio Triple J performing a weekly guest spot on the drive-time program in 1998. They became full-time presenters for that segment for the next two years; regulars on their show included Myf Warhurst and Peter Helliar. 

In 2001, they moved to newly launched commercial radio station Nova 96.9 for the breakfast radio shift (6am to 9am). They remained in this time slot from the station&#x27;s launch until the show&#x27;s end. Sami Lukis at one time served as a co-host until she moved to Brisbane at the end of 2007. In 2008, actress Kate Ritchie began to co-host the show. 

In 2009, previous co-host Lukis started co-hosting a breakfast program on Triple M in Sydney, directly competing with Merrick and Rosso. On 10 November 2009, Ross announced his impending departure from the Merrick, Rosso &amp; Kate breakfast show. Ritchie also announced her departure from the show, while Watts planned to continue on radio. Ross&#x27;s departure ended an 11-year radio partnership with Watts. Merrick and Rosso&#x27;s final radio show as a duo on Nova 969 took place on 4 December 2009. Tributes were paid to them by comedians including Peter Helliar and Judith Lucy, as well as celebrities such as Tom Williams and Ray Hadley. Snippets of the duo&#x27;s favourite prank calls were played, as well as an audio montage of highlights from the past nine years.

==Television programs ==
Their first foray into television was a short-lived pay TV show, &quot;Planet Merrick and Rosso&quot; (later known as &quot;Super Planet Merrick and Rosso&quot;) on The Comedy Channel. In 2003 their television show &quot;Merrick and Rosso Unplanned&quot; debuted on the Nine Network, based on the antiformat established by &quot;Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned&quot; in the UK. It featured comedy, chat and audience interaction which ran for three seasons. In 2005, Merrick and Rosso starred in the television series &quot;The B Team&quot; on Network Ten. On 7 July 2007 they presented at Live Earth.

Merrick Watts has also appeared in the comedy series &quot;The Hollowmen&quot; and &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. In 2008, the duo starred in a new comedy series, &quot;The Merrick &amp; Rosso Show&quot; on The Comedy Channel. He has also appeared as Marty Johnstone, a New Zealand drug dealer who was originally the leader of the Mr Asia drug syndicate in the hit series &quot;&quot;.

== The Merrick &amp; Rosso Show ==
In 2008, Merrick and Rosso returned to Australia&#x27;s Comedy Channel with an original format entitled &quot;The Merrick &amp; Rosso Show&quot;. A mixture of sketches, stunts and parodies, often featuring the guest star, it quickly became the highest rating show in the channel&#x27;s fifteen-year history. Guests throughout the first season were Ray Martin, Brendan Cowell, Kate Ritchie, The Veronicas, Stephen Curry, Ian Thorpe, Ryan &#x27;Fitzy&#x27; Fitzgerald, Peter Helliar, Hugh Jackman, Dicko and Judith Lucy.

One popular sketch that picked up a following on YouTube and FunnyorDie was &#x27;The Almost Transformers&#x27; which featured the stars disguised as a fridge and a washing machine for the purpose of terrifying shoppers. Another stunt included adopting an entire village in PNG (a popular trend amongst Hollywood celebrities) and renaming it Merrick &amp; Rosso Land, distributing T-shirts bearing slogans such as &quot;Sorry Madonna, I&#x27;m Taken&quot;, &quot;Angelina Rejected Me&quot; and &quot;Property of Merrick And Rosso&quot;.

Guests for the second series included Will Ferrell, The Wiggles, Ed Phillips, Tommy Williams, Magda Szubanski, Bob Evans, Eskimo Joe, David Wenham, Asher Keddie, Charlotte Dawson and Alex Perry, Antonia Kidman and cricketer Stuart MacGill.

The show also created the anti-testimonial, where big-name celebrity guests who came into the Nova studios were given (often scripted) material and invited to explain why they could not or did not want to appear on the TV show. Anti-Testimonials were given by Will Smith, Lily Allen, Russell Brand, Chris Rock, Ryan Reynolds, Kelly Clarkson, Rhys Darby, Seth Rogen, Macy Gray, Eric Hutchinson and Cesar Millan.

==Podcast==
Apart from the official Nova 96.9 breakfast show podcast, Merrick &amp; Rosso also recorded their own podcast Original Pirate Material on a daily basis. Their podcast is a mix of email reading, uncensored material and prank calls. The last Original Pirate Material podcast was published on 15 November 2006.

<doc id="998566" wikidata="Q1772983" url="?curid=998566" title="Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)">
<text>Santiago () is a province which currently comprises one of the 32 provinces of the Dominican Republic. It is divided into 10 municipalities and its capital city is Santiago de los Caballeros. Located in north-central Dominican Republic, in the Cibao region, it is bordered by the provinces of Valverde to the north-west, Puerto Plata to the north, Espaillat and La Vega to the east, San Juan to the south and Santiago Rodríguez to the west.

It is home to an intellectual, educational, and cultural center. It is also a major industrial center with rum, textile, cigarette and cigar industries based there. Shoe manufacturing, leather goods, and furniture making are important parts of the province&#x27;s economic life. Santiago also has major Free Zone centers with four important industrial free zones; it also has an important cement factory. Santiago is home to one of the largest medical centers in the country, Clínica Unión Médica, which serves all 14 provinces of El Cibao.

Also within striking distance there are a good number of pleasant towns, many of which are quite prosperous. It is surrounded by tall mountains that have for years protected it from hurricanes and allows for dense tropical forests to develop on the slopes of such mountains, which are among the highest in the region.

==Geography==
Santiago province is located in a valley within the Northern Cordillera that crosses the entire north of the country and also is the Diego de Ocampo peak of 1,249 meters above sea level. To the west are numerous hills that separate the Western Valley of the Cibao with the Valley of the Vega Real. The highest mountains in the province are La Pelona, La Rusilla that it shares with La Vega, and Pico Duarte that it shares with the province of San Juan, the latter is the tallest mountain in the Caribbean region.

In the province is the José Armando Bermúdez National Park, one of the largest in the country and the most important forest reserve on the island. The main river that crosses Santiago is the Yaque del Norte, which borders the entire southern part of the province. In addition, there are other rivers of great importance that run through the province such as the Bao, Jagua, Inoa, Ámina and Licey rivers.

==History==

Santiago was founded in 1495, originally on the banks of the Yaque del Norte River, but it is not yet very clear why it was moved in 1504 to the rural community of Jacagua, at the foot of the Diego de Ocampo peak. This seat was destroyed by an earthquake in 1562, then it was moved to where it is today.

In 1504 Nicolás de Ovando, the then governor of the island, transferred the province to Jacagua. From a fortress it became a civilian town. The reasons for the transfer are unknown; what is clear, however, is that the new settlement was made on fertile lands. Like other towns on the island, on July 7, 1508, Queen Juana I of Spain granted Santiago the title of town and also granted it a noble coat of arms.

==Economy==
Santiago is economically one of the most important provinces in the country. It has about 1,500,000 inhabitants and is the province that has the lowest number of unemployed due to its economic diversity. Industries of all kinds are concentrated in Santiago de los Caballeros
More than a million people from different parts of the region and the country move daily. The province of Santiago contributes 14% of the GDP of the Dominican Republic.

Santiago has a modern, high-quality rum and tobacco industry, which competes in the most demanding world markets. The tobacco industry, as in the past, remains a cornerstone of its economy and a source of thousands of jobs in the area. The region is also a major producer and exporter of raw tobacco to Europe, as well as coffee and cocoa. Its diversified agriculture also produces numerous crops that supply the Santo Domingo market and other communities. Located in the heart of the island, Santiago is endowed with agile access roads, being 2 hours from Santo Domingo and 45 minutes from Puerto Plata, both cities with important ports and airports for the transport of merchandise and passengers to and from abroad.

In the industrial branch, the community has also stood out with notable successes. The development of the industrial sector in Santiago can be divided into two: that of national production and that of free export zones. Internal production is broad in a diverse range of activities, such as cigarettes, shoes, leather, meat food processors, food packaging industries (vegetable and vegetable fats), metal-mechanics, packaging, ceramics, crafts and materials of construction such as cement factory, blocks, windows, doors and others.

Another economic lung of the province is the Industrial Free Zone of Santiago, which produces about 20% of the foreign exchange generated by all the free zones of the country. It is the first in job creation. By 1995, it had a workforce of 32,000 jobs, distributed in 79 companies that manufacture textiles, cigarettes, shoes, plastics, leather, communications, electrical equipment, among others. In 1998 there were an average of 52,943 employees with a total of 114 companies.

The services sector is also strongly development in Santiago. A broad and productive class of merchants, an efficient banking system, communications, tourism, professionals from various disciplines, contribute greatly to the economic and social development of the Dominican Republic. Most of the banking institutions in the Dominican Republic have opened new branches in Santiago, which also helps to boost the economy in the province.

The Free Zones that have been consolidated in this region are considered the strongest and best structured in the Dominican Republic. There are seven industrial parks and they generate approximately 48 thousand direct jobs and move around 30 million pesos per week. In terms of exports, it is estimated about 600 million dollars a year.

As well as performing as a comedian, Ross has fronted the comedy band Black Rose, which opened the Vivofit festival in Melbourne and Sydney in 2009.

Ross began his careers with Merrick Watts at Triple J performing a weekly guest spot on the drive-time program on Triple J radio in 1998 as Merrick and Rosso. They became full-time presenters and then in 2001 they moved to newly launched commercial radio station Nova 96.9 for the breakfast radio shift.

At the end of 2011 Ross rejoined breakfast radio, signing for Sydney commercial radio station Mix 106.5 with co-host comedian Claire Hooper.

In December 2012, Mix 106.5 announced that Ross and Hooper would be replaced by a new breakfast show with Sami Lukis and Yumi Stynes in 2013. Tim was appointed drive presenter on the Mix Network with anchor Matt Baseley.

They had a guest role on top rating Australian drama series All Saints in 2003. In 2003 their television show &quot;Merrick and Rosso Unplanned&quot; debuted on the Nine Network followed by &quot;The B Team&quot; on Network Ten in 2005.

In 2021, Ross presented &quot;Designing A Legacy&quot;, a one-hour television documentary on the ABC, where Ross met with families whose lives had been shaped by iconic architecture.

<text>In social science and economics, corporate capitalism is a capitalist marketplace characterized by the dominance of hierarchical and bureaucratic corporations.

==Overview==

In the developed world, corporations dominate the marketplace, comprising 50% or more of all businesses. Those businesses which are not corporations contain the same bureaucratic structure of corporations, but there is usually a sole owner or group of owners who are liable to bankruptcy and criminal charges relating to their business. Corporations have limited liability.

Corporations are usually called public entities or publicly traded entities when parts of their business can be bought in the form of shares on the stock market. This is done as a way of raising capital to finance the investments of the corporation. The shareholders appoint the executives of the corporation, who are the ones running the corporation via a hierarchical chain of power, where the bulk of investor decisions are made at the top and have effects on those beneath them.

== Criticisms ==

Corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns. Many social scientists have criticized corporations for failing to act in the interests of the people, and their existence seems to circumvent the principles of democracy, which assumes equal power relations between individuals in a society.

Dwight D. Eisenhower criticized the notion of the confluence of corporate power and &quot;de facto&quot; fascism, but nevertheless brought attention to the &quot;conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry&quot; (the military–industrial complex) in his 1961 Farewell Address to the Nation, and stressed &quot;the need to maintain balance in and among national programs—balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage&quot;.

<doc id="998578" wikidata="Q2021942" url="?curid=998578" title="Santiago Rodríguez Province">
<text>Santiago Rodríguez () is a province in the northwest region of the Dominican Republic. It was split from Monte Cristi in 1948. The Santiago Rodríguez province has the Monte Cristi and Valverde provinces to the north, the Santiago province to the east, the San Juan and Elías Piña provinces to the south and the Dajabón province to the west.

==Geography==
The province of Santiago Rodríguez presents a rugged relief with characteristics such as mountains, forests, hills, savannas and valleys all around. To the north, and separating it from the great Cibao valley, a formation composed of xerophilous vegetation known as the &quot;Sierra Zamba&quot; is observed.

Wide canyons formed by the two rivers that drain the area, the Cana and the Gurabo, have formed and shaped a landscape composed of narrow gorges and ravines that embellish the topography of the region. In the south, the Central Mountain Range rises imposing itself on the Northeast landscape.

===Climate===
The province of Santiago Rodríguez has a variable altitude from 159 m s. n. m. in the city of San Ignacio de Sabaneta up to more than 2000 m s. n. m. in mountainous areas. It has a tropical humid forest climate at the foot of the Cordillera Central, dry subtropical north of the Sierra Zamba, tropical semi-humid in the center and temperate humid in the high mountainous areas of the Cordillera Central.

There are two rainy seasons a year, May–June and September–October, with May being the rainiest month. The average annual temperature is 25 °C in the lowlands and 16 °C in the mountainous plains.

The province of Santiago Rodríguez is the richest of the Northwest provinces in terms of hydrographic basins. Three of the most important rivers in the country are born in its territory: Mao, Artibonito and Guayubín.

==History==

The capital town of the province was founded in 1844 by Santiago Rodríguez, who was an officer of the Dominican army in the Dominican War of Independence. He was one of the founders of the city of Sabaneta and an important military leader during the initial stages of the &quot;Restoration War&quot; (1863–1865). Sabaneta was the centre of the fight against the Spanish soldiers during this war. In 1854, the town was elevated to the category of Military Post and in 1858 it was incorporated into a municipality of the Santiago province.

When 1879 Monte Cristi became a province, San Ignacio de Sabaneta was made a municipality of that new province. When the new province of Santiago Rodríguez was created in 1948, San Ignacio de Sabaneta was made the head municipality of the province. On March 23, 1898, the President of the Republic at that time, Ulises Heureaux, under decree No. 3799 assigned the name of Monción, in honor of the hero of the Dominican Restoration War, General Benito Monción.4 In In 1907, Monción became the official municipality of the province of Monte Cristi. Then, in 1948, when the Province of Santiago Rodríguez was created, it became its municipality. It is found specifically in the southwestern part of the province.

==Municipalities==

The province as of June 20, 2006 is divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;):
*San Ignacio de Sabaneta, provincial capital
*Monción
*Villa Los Almácigos

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities with population figures as of the 2012 census.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

== Economy ==
Currently, the province has companies such as San Miguel del Caribe (Kola Real) and Mega Plax, making it an important commercial center in the region. The main economic activity in the province is agricultural production.

Although tourism has not developed as in other areas of the country, the province has ecotourism potential due to the high quality offered by its mountain landscapes, rivers and mild climate. Its main attractions are the mountains, including the Armando Bermúdez National Park area. The places of La Leonor, El Aguacate, Boca de los Mao, Cenovi, Lomita de La Cidra, La Peonía, El Burende and Palo Amarillo offer a warm and pleasant environment. Monte Gallo with 1840 meters of elevation and nestled in the national park, offers an extraordinary landscape. The installation of industries in the province is notable in recent years, favoring economic development.

According to the latest studies presented, the province is currently one of the highest human development index in the Dominican Republic. Santiago Rodriguez is a province of the Dominican Republic that has interesting tourist attraction, located mainly in the mountains. San Ignacio de Sabaneta, the main town is a beautiful and clean city, one of the nicest places of the Dominican Republic. The town has several parks, boulevards and a quiet atmosphere.

Just a few miles away, the visitor is going to find hills, mountains and one of the wildest places of the caribbean nature, that is Armando Bermudez National Park. This national park has rivers, mountain streams, and great variety of plants, birds and wildlife. One of the biggest attractions are the interminable pine trees, the largest stronghold of primary forest in the country. Next to this park is Moncion Damn or Presa de Moncion, an artificial lake surrounded by hills and mountains. Its deep blue waters are rich in fish.

<doc id="998579" wikidata="Q641513" url="?curid=998579" title="Mopane">
<text>Colophospermum mopane, commonly called mopane, mopani, balsam tree, butterfly tree, or turpentine tree, is a tree in the legume family (Fabaceae), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, in elevation, in the far northern parts of Southern Africa. The tree only occurs in Africa and is the only species in genus Colophospermum. Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees.

==Range and habitat==

It is native to Southern Africa, including Southern Angola, Zambia, Southern Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and northern South Africa. It grows in alkaline (high lime content) soils which are shallow and not well drained. It also grows in alluvial soils (soil deposited by rivers). Where it occurs, it is often the dominant tree species, frequently forming homogeneous stands. In Northern South Africa and larger adjacent areas of Botswana and Zimbabwe, with the trees&#x27; height varying between , they are often called &quot;mopane scrub&quot; (shrub). However, they can also sometimes grow taller in these areas, forming woodland. Further north the trees are taller and form tall woodlands referred to as cathedral mopane. This tree does not grow well outside hot, frost-free areas with summer rainfall.

===Mopane ecoregions===
There are two ecoregions where mopane is the predominant vegetation. The Angolan mopane woodlands are in southwestern Angola and northern Namibia, and the Zambezian and mopane woodlands extend over the lowlands of the Zambezi River and its tributaries in Botswana, Eswatini, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, and South Africa.

==Uses==

Mopane wood is one of southern Africa&#x27;s heaviest, with a density of when completely dry, and is difficult to work because of its hardness. However, this also makes it termite resistant. For this reason it has long been used for building houses and fences, as railway sleepers and as pit props. The termite-resistance and rich, reddish colouring also make it popular for flooring. Outside Africa, mopane is gaining popularity as a heavy, decorative wood, its uses including aquarium ornaments, bases for lamps or sculptures, and garden accents.

It is also increasingly being used in the construction of musical instruments, particularly woodwind. Suitable quality African blackwood (&quot;Dalbergia melanoxylon&quot;), traditionally used for clarinets, is becoming harder to find. Mopane is fairly oily, seasons very well with few splits or shakes, and produces instruments of a warm, rich tone. Clarinets made of mopane are offered by the manufacturers Seggelke Klarinetten, F. Arthur Uebel and Buffet Crampon.

Mopane twigs have been traditionally used as tooth brushes, the bark to make twine and for tanning leather, and the leaves for healing wounds. The wood is also used to make charcoal and for braai wood.

The tree is a major food source for the mopane worm, the caterpillar of the moth &quot;Gonimbrasia belina&quot;. The caterpillars are rich in protein and are eaten by people. The mopane worm is rich in crude fats and contains vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium and phosphorus. The tree also acts as a foodplant for the wild silk moth, &quot;Gonometa rufobrunnea&quot;. Cocoons of the moth are harvested as wild silk, to make cloth.

The Mopane worm creates employment and serves as a source of income for the majority of rural women. Harvesters sell it in villages, towns or to the trader

The mopane tree also serves as a host plant for the mopane psyllid &quot;Retroacizzia mopani&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Colophospermum&quot; is Latinised Greek for &quot;oily seed&quot;, in reference to the resinous seed (i.e. &quot;spermum&quot;) which has a turpentine smell. Colophon was the birthplace of Homer in Ionia, and was famous for its rosin, a substance obtained from turpentine or the gummy exudate of some trees. The species name &quot;mopane&quot; is taken from the local name for the tree.

<doc id="998585" wikidata="Q155279" url="?curid=998585" title="Dolores Costello">
<text>Dolores Costello (September 17, 1903 – March 1, 1979) was an American film actress who achieved her greatest success during the era of silent movies. She was nicknamed &quot;The Goddess of the Silent Screen&quot; by her first husband, the actor John Barrymore. She was the mother of John Drew Barrymore and grandmother of actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore.

==Early years==
Dolores Costello was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the daughter of actors Maurice Costello and Mae Costello (née Altschuk). She was of Irish and German descent. She had a younger sister, Helene, and the two made their early film appearances from 1909 to 1915 as child actresses for the Vitagraph Film Company. They played supporting roles in several films starring their father, who was a popular matinee idol at the time.

==Film career==

The two sisters appeared on Broadway together as chorus line dancers, and their success resulted in contracts with Warner Bros. Pictures. In 1926, following small parts in feature films, Dolores Costello was selected by John Barrymore to star with him in &quot;The Sea Beast&quot;, a loose adaptation of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, after which Warner soon began starring her in her own vehicles. Meanwhile, she and Barrymore became involved romantically, and married in 1928.

Within a few years of achieving stardom, Costello had become a film personality in her own right. As a young adult, her career developed to the degree that in 1926, she was named a WAMPAS Baby Star, and had acquired the nickname &quot;The Goddess of the Silver Screen&quot;.

Warners alternated Costello between films with contemporary settings and elaborate costume dramas. In 1927, she was re-teamed with John Barrymore in &quot;When a Man Loves&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. In 1928, she co-starred with George O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, a part-talkie epic directed by Michael Curtiz.

Costello spoke with a lisp and found it difficult to make the transition to talking pictures, but after two years of voice coaching she was comfortable speaking before a microphone. One of her early sound film appearances was with her sister Helene in the Warner Bros. all-star extravaganza &quot;The Show of Shows&quot; (1929).

Her acting career became less of a priority for her following the birth of her first child, Dolores Ethel Mae &quot;DeeDee&quot; Barrymore, on April 8, 1930, and she retired from the screen in 1931 to devote time to her family. Her second child, John Drew Barrymore, was born on June 4, 1932, but the marriage proved difficult due to her husband&#x27;s increasing alcoholism, and they divorced in 1935.

She resumed her career a year later and achieved some successes, most notably in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). She retired permanently from acting following her appearance in &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943), again under the direction of Michael Curtiz.

Making a rare radio appearance, Costello appeared as the Danish Countess Elsa on the radio program &quot;Suspense&quot; on August 28, 1943. The title of the episode was &quot;The King&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, written by Corporal Leonard Pellitier, U.S. Army.

==Later years==
In 1939, she married Dr. John Vruwink, an obstetrician who was her physician during her pregnancies, but they divorced in 1950. Costello spent the remaining years of her life in semi-seclusion, managing an avocado farm. Her film career largely was ruined by the destructive effects of early film makeup, which ravaged her complexion too severely to camouflage. Her final film was &quot;This Is the Army&quot; (1943). In the 1970s, her house was inundated in a flashflood that caused a good deal of damage to her property and memorabilia from her movie career and life with John Barrymore.

Costello has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures at 1645 Vine Street.

==Filmography==

===Child roles===
Costello appeared as a child actress in many films made from 1909 to 1915. Among them are:

<doc id="998589" wikidata="Q1774848" url="?curid=998589" title="Valverde Province">
<text>Valverde () is a province of the Dominican Republic. It was split from Santiago Province in 1959. It is in the northwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Santa Cruz de Mao.
It was created on 1959. It was a municipality of the Santiago province before being elevated to the category of province. Valverde was the birthplace of former President of the Republic from July 1857 to August 1858, General José Desiderio Valverde, for whom this province bears his name.

==History==
The territory of the current Valverde province was one of the first non-coastal regions explored by Europeans because it was located to the south of La Isabela, the first city founded on the island. Close to it was the most accessible place to cross the Northern Cordillera, which was named by Christopher Columbus as the Port (or Pass) of Los Hidalgos. Columbus built a fort on the banks of the Yaque del Norte River.

Despite these early explorations the territory remained very sparsely inhabited during the colonial era, except for some isolated ranches where cattle roamed. The population, and number of herds, increased slightly during the 17th century with people who had been evicted from Monte Cristi and Bayajá (the &quot;Osorio Devastations&quot;) and who preferred to remain in this area, close to their places of origin.

Its location halfway between the border with the French colony of Saint-Domingue (later, the Republic of Haiti) and the city of Santiago de los Caballeros meant that French and Haitian troops had to cross the territory of the current province, at least in its northern part, when they went to fight in Santiago. The soldiers of this land had the purpose of preventing enemy troops from crossing the northern part to attack and take the city of Santiago.

After the Dominican War of Independence and the War of Restoration some towns of some importance began to develop, especially Mao. In 1918, Luis L. Bogaert, a resident Belgian engineer, built the country&#x27;s first irrigation canal, allowing him to irrigate his land and start growing rice. This was a major change in the region, and in time the province would become one of the country&#x27;s leading rice producers.

When the Esperanza sugar mill was installed in the municipality of Esperanza at the end of the 1950s, many people immigrated to this municipality, significantly increasing the total population of the province. The province was officially created in 1958 with separate territory of the Santiago and Monte Cristi provinces (the territory that corresponds to Laguna Salada). It was integrated by the municipalities Valverde (now Mao) and Esperanza, and the Municipal District of Laguna Salada dependent on Esperanza. In 1967 the name of Mao was restored to the main municipality, conserving the name of Valverde for the province.

==Municipalities and municipal districts==
The province as of June 20, 2006 was divided into the following municipalities (&quot;municipio&quot;) and municipal districts (&quot;distrito municipal&quot; - D.M.) and the municipal Seat (&quot;distrito cabecera&quot; - D.C.) within them:
* Santa Cruz de Mao, head municipality of the province
** Ámina (D.M.)
** Guatapanal (D.M.)
** Pueblo Nuevo (D.M.)
*Esperanza
** Boca de Mao (D.M.)
** Jicomé (M.D.)
** Maizal (M.D.)
** Paradero (M.D.)
*Laguna Salada
** Cruce de Guayacanes (D.M.)
** Jaibon (D.M.) 
** La Caya (D.M.)

The following is a sortable table of the municipalities with population figures as of the 2012 census; the population figures for the municipal districts are included within their municipalities. Urban population are those living in the seats (&quot;cabeceras&quot;: literally, heads) of municipalities or of municipal districts. Rural population are those living in the districts (&quot;Secciones&quot;: literally, sections) and neighborhoods (&quot;Parajes&quot;: literally, places) outside of them.

For comparison with the municipalities and municipal districts of other provinces see the list of municipalities and municipal districts of the Dominican Republic.

==Name==
The province was named Valverde after José Desiderio Valverde, an officer of the Dominican army when the Dominican-Haitian War. Later, he was President of the Dominican Republic for one year (July 1857 - August 1858). He was from Santiago de los Caballeros.

==Geography==

The Valverde province has a total area of . It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 28th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.

South of the city of Mao are the &quot;Sierra Samba&quot; (a chain of low hills) and part of the &quot;Cordillera Central&quot; mountain range. The highest mountains of the island are in the Cordillera Central but in the Valverde province there are only low mountains.

There are several important rivers that flow through the territory of the province. The most important river is the Yaque del Norte, that flows from east to west; the other rivers are all tributaries of Yaque del Norte. Other important rivers are Mao and Ámina that come from the Cordillera Central.

==Location==
The Valverde province is in the northwest part of the Cibao valley. It is bordered to the north by the Puerto Plata province, to the east and south by the Santiago province, to the southwest by the Santiago Rodríguez province and to the west by the Monte Cristi province.

<text>The Clarendon Laboratory, located on Parks Road within the Science Area in Oxford, England (not to be confused with the Clarendon Building, also in Oxford), is part of the Department of Physics at Oxford University. It houses the atomic and laser physics, condensed matter physics, and biophysics groups within the Department, although four other Oxford Physics groups are not based in the Clarendon Lab. The Oxford Centre for Quantum Computation is also housed in the laboratory.

==Buildings==
The Clarendon Laboratory consists of two adjoining buildings, the Lindemann Building (named after Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell) and the Grade II listed Townsend Building (named after Sir John Sealy Townsend).

The Beecroft Building (named after Adrian Beecroft) is now immediately in front of the Lindemann Building, completed in 2018 and designed by Hawkins\Brown, with a budget of approximately £40 million.

==History==

The Clarendon is named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, whose trustees paid £10,000 for the building of the original laboratory, completed in 1872, making it the oldest purpose-built physics laboratory in England. The building was designed by Robert Bellamy Clifton.

The brothers Fritz and Heinz London developed the London equations when working there in 1935.

In 2007, the laboratory was granted chemical landmark status.
The award was bestowed due to the work carried out by Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley in 1914.

==Current use==
The original building, substantially enlarged, is now part of the Oxford Earth Sciences Department.
The Oxford Electric Bell apparatus (also known as the Clarendon Dry Pile), constructed in 1840, is located in the foyer of the Clarendon Laboratory.

<doc id="998591" wikidata="Q7340156" url="?curid=998591" title="Rob Glaser">
<text>Robert Denis Glaser (born January 16, 1962) is the founder of RealNetworks, which produces RealAudio, RealVideo, RealPlayer, and Helix, among other products and services. Before founding RealNetworks, he worked for Microsoft for ten years.

Glaser, while chief executive of RealNetworks, clashed repeatedly with Tony Fadell, widely known as the Godfather of the iPhone and iPod, who then left the company after 6 weeks and went on to founding the products for Apple.

== Education and Career ==
In 1983, Glaser graduated Yale University with an BS degree in Computer Science and an MA in Economics.

In 1984, Glaser began work at Microsoft. In 1994, he founded Progressive Networks which became RealNetworks in 1997. Glaser served as CEO until 2010.

Since June 2010, Glaser has been a partner at global venture firm, Accel Partners, focusing on digital media technology, social media, and mobile service investments. He returned to RealNetworks again as interim CEO in 2012 and resumed the official title of CEO in 2014. In 2020 Glaser invested $10 million of his own money into the company to support its move into facial recognition technology.

== Other Activities ==
On June 16, 2004, Glaser received the Music Visionary Award, along with EMI Vice Chairman David Munns, from the Music for Youth Foundation, and the United Jewish Appeal.

Glaser was the 22nd largest individual donor to 527 groups in the 2004 US election, donating over $2.2 million to pro-Democratic organizations. He was the leading creditor to Air America Radio, loaning at least $9.8 million according to its bankruptcy filing. In addition, along with economist Jeffrey Sachs and public health expert Josh Ruxin, Glaser founded the Access Project, an NGO dedicated to improving health care in Rwanda by increasing management capacity at health centers. In 1999, Glaser established the Glaser Progress Foundation, &quot;to build a more just, sustainable and humane world.&quot; From 2011 to 2015, foundation assets have shrunk from $9 million to $5.7 million; annual grants have shrunk from $1.5 million to $267,000; overhead and expenses have grown slightly from $455,000 to $525,000. In 2016, he set up a web site (PutinTrump.org) to monitor and report then-candidate Donald Trump&#x27;s connections to Vladimir Putin.

<doc id="998595" wikidata="Q13635143" url="?curid=998595" title="Ferrite bead">
<text>A ferrite beadalso called a ferrite block, ferrite core, ferrite ring, [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] filter, or ferrite chokeis a type of choke that suppresses high-frequency electronic noise in electronic circuits.

Ferrite beads employ high-frequency current dissipation in a ferrite ceramic to build high-frequency noise suppression devices.

== Use ==
Ferrite beads prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI) in two directions: &quot;from&quot; a device or &quot;to&quot; a device. A conductive cable acts as an antenna – if the device produces radio-frequency energy, this can be &quot;transmitted&quot; through the cable, which acts as an unintentional radiator. In this case, the bead is required for regulatory compliance to reduce EMI. Conversely, if there are other sources of EMI, such as household appliances, the bead prevents the cable from acting as an antenna and &quot;receiving&quot; interference from these other devices. This is particularly common on data cables and medical equipment.

Large ferrite beads are commonly seen on external cabling. In addition, various smaller ferrite beads are used internally in circuits—on conductors or around the pins of small circuit-board components, such as transistors, connectors, and integrated circuits.

Beads can block low-level unintended radio frequency energy on wires intended to be DC conductors by acting as a low-pass filter. For example, on unbalanced coax transmission lines (such as video cables), the cable is designed to contain the signal, and beads can be used to block stray common mode current from using the cable as an antenna while not interfering with the signal carried inside the cable. In this use, the bead is a simple form of a balun.

Ferrite beads are one of the simplest and least expensive interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties, or if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. (However, although each loop increases the impedance to high frequencies, it also shifts the frequency of the highest impedance to a lower frequency.) Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.

Surface-mount ferrite beads are available. Like any other surface-mount inductor, these are soldered into a gap in the printed circuit board trace. Inside the bead component, a coil of wire runs between layers of ferrite to form a multi-turn inductor around the high-permeability core.

== Theory of operation ==


Ferrite beads are used as a passive low-pass filter by dissipating radio frequency (RF) energy as heat by design.

Ideal inductors, on the other hand, have no resistance and hence do not dissipate energy as heat. Ideal inductors only have inductive reactance, which reduces the flow of high-frequency signals by returning some of their energy back towards the signal source (possibly reducing the amount of power drawn) rather than dissipating that energy as heat (as done by the resistance in ferrite beads). While an inductor&#x27;s reactance may commonly be referred to simply as &quot;impedance&quot;, impedance generally can be any combination of resistance and reactance. 

The geometry and electromagnetic properties of coiled wire over the ferrite bead result in an impedance for high-frequency signals, attenuating high-frequency EMI/RFI electronic noise. The energy is either reflected back up the cable or dissipated as low-level heat. Only in extreme cases is the heat noticeable.

A ferrite bead can be added to an inductor to improve, in two ways, its ability to block unwanted high frequency noise. First, the ferrite concentrates the magnetic field, increasing inductance and, therefore, reactance, which filters out the noise. Second, if the ferrite is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of resistance in the ferrite itself. The ferrite creates an inductor with a very low Q factor. This loss heats the ferrite, generally by a negligible amount. While the signal level is large enough to cause interference or undesirable effects in sensitive circuits, the energy blocked is typically relatively small. Depending on the application, the resistive loss characteristic of the ferrite may or may not be desired.

A design that uses a ferrite bead to improve noise filtering must consider specific circuit characteristics and the frequency range to block. Different ferrite materials have different properties concerning frequency, and the manufacturer&#x27;s literature helps select the most effective material for the frequency range.

<text>Philibert Commerson (; 18 November 1727 – 14 March 1773), sometimes spelled Commerçon by contemporaries, was a French naturalist, best known for accompanying Louis Antoine de Bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation in 1766–1769. 

==Biography==

Commerson was born at Châtillon-les-Dombes in France. He studied in Montpellier, and for a time was a practicing physician. He was in contact with Carl Linnaeus, who encouraged him to study fish of the Mediterranean.

Commerson returned to live at Châtillon-les-Dombes, where he occupied himself in creating a botanical garden in 1758. After the death of his wife in 1762, he moved to Paris.

In 1766, Commerson joined Bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation after being recommended for the position of naturalist by the Paris Academy of Sciences. He had previously drawn up an extensive programme of nature studies for the Marine Ministry, in which he elaborated the &quot;three natural kingdoms&quot; which a naturalist should investigate on a voyage around the world. Among the wildlife that Commerson observed was a particular kind of dolphin in the Strait of Magellan, now known as Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Cephalorhynchus commersonii&quot;).

Commerson&#x27;s partner and assistant, Jeanne Baré (also referred to Jeanne Baret), accompanied him on the voyage, disguised as a man. Baré acted as a nurse to Commerson, who was often ill, as well as assisting him in his scientific work. Her gender was only publicly discovered while the expedition was at Tahiti, but she remained with Commerson, nursing him and assisting him in his professional activities until the end of his life.

Commerson was an astute observer of the Tahitian people and culture, thanks in part to a remarkable lack of European prejudice compared to other early visitors to the island. Commerson and Bougainville together were responsible for spreading the myth of Tahitians as the embodiment of the concept of the noble savage.

Commerson also studied and collected plants wherever the expedition stopped; among others, he described the genus &quot;Bougainvillea&quot;. On the return voyage to France in 1768, he remained behind at Mauritius (the then-French &quot;Isle de France&quot;), in order to botanize there and on Madagascar, an island that fascinated him. Pierre Sonnerat, who would also become a renowned botanist, was his personal secretary on the &quot;Isle de France&quot;.

==Taxon described by him==
*See :Category:Taxa named by Philibert Commerson

==Species collected by Commerson==
*The Wrasse Pastel ringwrasse, &quot;Hologymnosus doliatus&quot; was originally formally described as &quot;Labrus doliatus&quot; in 1801 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in Volume 5 of his &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons&quot; based on a drawing by Commerson. In 1801 Lacépède created the genus &quot;Hologymnosus&quot; and designated a species, &quot;Hologymnosus fasciatus&quot;, he had just described as its type species, this was later shown to be a synonym of &quot;H. doliatus&quot;.
*Commerson provided the first description of the Ring-tailed cardinalfish (&quot;Ostorhinchus aureus&quot;) from Réunion in the western Indian Ocean, but it was not published in a format allowing full citation. Therefore, the species name and description by Bernard Germain de Lacépède (who acknowledged Commerson) takes precedence, albeit with a nod to Commerson.
*&quot;Gomphosus caeruleus&quot; was formally described in 1801 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in the third volume of his &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons&quot; from types collected by Commerson. No type locality was given, but now it is known to be Mauritius.
*The first notes taken on Rufous hornero &quot;Furnarius rufus&quot; were made by Commerson in 1767, from a specimen obtained at Barragán cove during Louis Antoine de Bougainville&#x27;s expedition. Commerson named the bird as &quot;Turdus fulvus&quot; and his notes were later published by Georges Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot; in 1779. However, the rufous hornero was first scientifically described, as &quot;Merops rufus&quot;, by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in the 13th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; published in 1788.
*&quot;Scatophagus tetracanthus&quot; was first formally described &quot;Chaetodon tetracanthus&quot; as in 1802 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède with no type locality given, Lacépède&#x27;s description was based on a drawing and manuscript by Commerson. The specific name is a compound of &quot;tetra&quot; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;acanthus&quot; which means &quot;spines&quot;, a reference to the four anal fin spines.
*&quot;Hologymnosus annulatus&quot; was formally described in 1801 as &quot;Labrus annulatus&quot; by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in Volume 3 of his &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons&quot; with the type locality given as Mauritius. Lacépède was following earlier work by Commerson.
*&quot;Trachinotus baillonii&quot; was formally described in 1801 by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède (1726-1825) as &quot;Caesiomorus bailloni&quot;, the name having been written in a manuscript by Commerson, but was not formally published. The identity of the person nonoured in the specific name is not clear but is either the French naturalist Louis Antoine François Baillon (1778-1851), or his father Jean François Emmanuel Baillon (1742-1801), who was also a naturalist.
*&quot;Artocarpus heterophyllus&quot; was named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck

==Death==
Commerson died at Mauritius at the age of 45. His extensive collections from the voyage did not, unfortunately, receive their deserved recognition. Although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to Paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated. Unaware of his death in 1773, the Paris Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later.

== Taxon named in his honor ==

In 1786, botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck named the genera &quot;Commersonia&quot; and &quot;Humbertia&quot; in his honour.

In 1798, French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède named the Giant Frogfish &quot;Antennarius commerson&quot; after Commerson.

In 1800, Lacépède named a species of mackerel of the family Scombridae found in a wide-ranging area in Southeast Asia, but as far west as the east coast of Africa and from the Middle East and along the northern coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, and as far east as the South West Pacific Ocean, the Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) after Commerson.

In 1801, &quot;Pomadasys commersonnii&quot; was first formally described as &quot;Labrus commersonnii&quot; by Lacépède with the type locality given as &quot;Grand golfe de l&#x27;Inde&quot;, interpreted as rivers of Madagascar. The specific name honors Commerçon, whose name is sometimes spelled Commerson, Lacepède used Commerçon&#x27;s drawings and notes to base his description on. The specific name &quot;argenteus&quot; means “silver” and refers to the main colour of this species.

Also in 1801, &quot;Scomberoides commersonnianus&quot; was formally described by the French zoologist Bernard Germain de Lacépède with the type locality given as Fort Dauphin in the Toliara Province of Madagascar. The specific name uses the Latin suffix &quot;ianus&quot; meaning &quot;belonging to&quot; and adds this to the surname of Commerçon, this also being spelled as Commerson, whose notes and illustration were used by Lacépède as the base for his description of the species.
In 1803, Lacépède named a species of North American freshwater fish &quot;Catostomus commersonii&quot; in his honour.

Also in 1803, Lacépède named a species of anchovy &quot;Stolephorus commersonnii&quot; after Commerson.

In 1804, The dolphin Commerson&#x27;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) is named by Lacépède after the French naturalist Commerson, who first described them in 1767 after sighting them in the Strait of Magellan.

In 1813, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire described Commerson&#x27;s roundleaf bat (Macronycteris commersoni), also known as Commerson&#x27;s leaf-nosed bat, which is a species of bat endemic to Madagascar. It is named after French naturalist Philibert Commerson (1727-1773).

In 1836, Achille Valenciennes named Hypostomus commersoni which is a species of catfish in the family Loricariidae. It is native to South America, where it occurs in the Paraná River drainage, including the Iguazu River, the Paraguay River, the Río de la Plata, and the Dulce River. It is typically found in rivers with muddy substrates and moderate currents.

In 1838, Eduard Rüppell named the Bluespotted Cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), also known as Smooth Cornetfish or Smooth Flutemouth, which is a marine fish which belongs to the family Fistulariidae after Commerson. This very long and slender reef-dweller belongs to the same order as the pipefishes and seahorses, called Syngnathiformes.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) New Democracy is a communist political party in India. The party was founded as a breakaway from the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Chandra Pulla Reddy) in 1988. The general secretary of this party is Yatendra Kumar.

The party is mainly based in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, but also has branches in Bihar, West Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Odisha, Haryana, etc.

The party had one member in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Gummadi Narsaiah who represented Yellandu Assembly constituency for five terms. The party also has one from Bihar, whose name is Umadhar Prasad Singh.
CPI (ML) ND has been following both parliamentary and non-parliamentary methods of class struggle. It participates in elections unlike the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and also has an underground guerrilla army with weapons. The party has open mass organizations like the Indian Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) for industrial workers and the All India Kisan-Mazdoor Sabha for farmers and agricultural workers.

In the recent years CPI (ML) ND has been more radicalized and started focusing more on the underground guerrilla work distancing itself from the parliamentary left and the moderate Marxist-Leninist factions.

CPI(M-L) ND has two big students unions, PDSU, and PSU in Punjab.

<text>The NASA Distinguished Service Medal is the highest award that can be bestowed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States. The medal may be presented to any member of the federal government, including both military astronauts and civilian employees.

The NASA Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to those who display distinguished service, ability, or courage, and have personally made a contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission. The contribution must be so extraordinary that other forms of recognition would be inadequate.

Typical presentations of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal included awards to senior NASA administrators, mission control leaders, and astronauts who have completed several successful space flights. Due to the prestige of the award, the decoration is authorized for wear on active uniforms of the United States military. Another such authorized decoration is the NASA Space Flight Medal.

Upon the recommendation of NASA, the president may award an even higher honor to astronauts, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

The medal was original awarded by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and was inherited by NASA. The first NASA version (type I), featuring the NASA seal, was issued from 1959 until 1964, when it was replaced by the current type II medal (shown).

<doc id="998622" wikidata="Q2962021" url="?curid=998622" title="Leader of the Official Opposition (Ontario)">
<text>The leader of the Official Opposition () is the leader of the largest political party in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario that is not in government and is typically the second-largest party. The position is formally titled the leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition (); under the Westminster system, while the parliamentary opposition opposes the incumbent government, it remains loyal to the Crown and thus to Canada.

Marit Stiles has served as the leader of the Official Opposition since February 4, 2023. She leads the New Democratic Party (NDP), which has held the second largest number of seats in the Legislative Assembly since the 2018 provincial election.

== History ==

Ontario&#x27;s first Leader of the Official Opposition was Edward Blake of the Ontario Liberal Party who held the position from 1869 until 1871 when he became Premier of Ontario (Archibald McKellar had previously led the Liberal Party in the legislature for two years, but was not formally recognized as opposition leader). Ten leaders were Premier before after they served this post.

* Archibald McKellar (Liberal) 1867-1869 was not formally recognized as opposition leader, but led the Liberal Party in the legislature.

== List of official opposition leaders ==
1 The Liberals were recognized as the Official Opposition following the 1923 election by the governing Conservatives, despite the fact that the United Farmers of Ontario had more seats. According to historian Peter Oliver, this was an arbitrary decision without basis in precedent or law. Conservative Premier G. Howard Ferguson used as justification an announcement by UFO general secretary James J. Morrison that the UFO would be withdrawing from party politics, though Oliver argues that this was facetious logic. UFO parliamentary leader Manning Doherty protested the decision, but to no avail. (source: Peter Oliver, &quot;G. Howard Ferguson: Ontario Tory&quot;, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1977), p. 158.)

2 From 1930, the Liberal Party was led by Mitchell Hepburn, but Sinclair continued as Leader of the Opposition as Hepburn did not seek a seat in the legislature until the 1934 general election which made him Premier.

3 Until 1954, the Liberals were led from outside the legislature by Walter Thomson with Oliver as acting Leader of the Opposition. Oliver led the party in his own right (for a second time) from 1954 until 1958.

4 Interim Liberal leader following the personal defeat of Wintermeyer in the 1963 provincial election until Thompson&#x27;s election as leader.

5 Interim Liberal leader of the party following the resignation of Stuart Smith.

6 Interim Liberal leader of the party following the personal defeat of Premier David Peterson in the 1990 election.

7 Elston became interim Liberal leader when Nixon resigned from the legislature to accept a federal appointment. Elston stepped down in November when he decided to be a candidate at the Liberal leadership convention.

8 Interim Liberal leader between resignation of Elston and election of McLeod.

9 John Tory was chosen as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party on September 18, 2004, but did not hold a seat in the legislature. On September 28 the party announced that Bob Runciman would act as interim PC leader until Tory entered the legislature. Tory was elected to represent Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey on March 17, 2005, and was sworn in as an MPP and leader of the opposition on March 29, 2005.

10 As Ontario PC leader John Tory did not win a seat in the 2007 election, Runciman served as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature. (Tory had been running in the Don Valley West riding.) After spending more than a year outside the legislature, Tory sought a seat in the March 5, 2009 by-election in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock. He lost this by-election, and thereafter resigned as party leader. Runciman served as interim party leader as well as opposition leader until Hudak was chosen as the party leadership convention.

11 Wilson served as interim leader of the Progressive Conservative party following the resignation of Tim Hudak and continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition after Patrick Brown became party leader on May 9, 2015, until September when Brown won a seat in the legislature through a by-election.

12 Vic Fedeli was chosen interim leader of the PC Party by caucus on January 26, 2018, one day after Patrick Brown resigned due to allegations of sexual misconduct. He continued to serve as Leader of the Opposition after Doug Ford became party leader on March 10, 2018, as Ford did not have a seat in the legislature.

13 Peter Tabuns was chosen as interim leader by the NDP caucus on June 28, 2022, following the resignation of Andrea Horwath.

<text>Martita Edith Hunt (30 January 190013 June 1969) was an Argentine-born British theatre and film actress. She had a dominant stage presence and played a wide range of powerful characters. She is best remembered for her performance as Miss Havisham in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946).

==Early life==
Hunt was born in Buenos Aires on 30 January 1900 to English parents Alfred and Marta (née Burnett) Hunt. Aged ten, she travelled with her parents to the United Kingdom, where she attended Queenwood Ladies&#x27; College in Eastbourne, and then trained as an actress.

==Career==
===Early theatrical career===
Hunt began her acting career in repertory theatre in Liverpool before moving to London. She first appeared there in the Stage Society&#x27;s production of Ernst Toller&#x27;s &quot;The Machine Wreckers&quot; at the Kingsway Theatre in May 1923. From 1923 to 1929, she appeared as the Principessa della Cercola in W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Our Betters&quot; (Globe, 1924) and as Mrs. Linde in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (Playhouse, 1925) in the West End, along with engagements at club theatres such as the Q Theatre and the Arts Theatre and a short 1926 Chekhov season at the small Barnes Theatre under Theodore Komisarjevsky (playing Charlotta Ivanovna, in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and Olga in &quot;Three Sisters&quot;). 

In September 1929, she joined the Old Vic company, then led by Harcourt Williams, and, during the following eight months played Béline in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginary Invalid&quot;, Queen Elizabeth in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;, and Lavinia in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;. However, her time there was more noted for a succession of Shakespearean roles: the Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, the Queen in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Portia in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;), Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot;). The latter three were with John Gielgud.

In Hunt&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Donald Roy wrote:&quot;With an arresting appearance and a dominant stage presence, she proved most effective as strong, tragic characters, her Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot; being accounted by some critics the finest they had seen.&quot;

She then returned to the West End (briefly returning to the Old Vic to play Emilia in the 1938 &quot;Othello&quot;), notably playing Edith Gunter in Dodie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot; (Lyric, 1931), the Countess of Rousillon in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (Arts, 1932), Lady Strawholme in Ivor Novello&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Fields&quot; (Criterion, 1933), Liz Frobisher in John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;The Distaff Side&quot; (Apollo, 1933), Barbara Dawe in Clemence Dane&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Is Silver&quot; (Queen&#x27;s, 1934), Theodora in Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;Not for Children&quot; (Fortune, 1935), Masha in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; (New Theatre, 1936), the Mother in an English-language version of García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Bodas de sangre&quot; (&quot;Marriage of Blood&quot;; Savoy, 1939), Léonie in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Les Parents Terribles&quot; (Gate, 1940), Mrs Cheveley in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (Westminster, 1943), and Cornelia in John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot; (Duchess, 1947).

===Early film career===
Hunt also appeared in many supporting roles in several popular British films, such as &quot;Good Morning, Boys&quot; (1937), &quot;Trouble Brewing&quot; (1939), and &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943). &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945) was an international success, but her next film role in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) would be her most famous and most lauded. As Miss Havisham, she reprised her role from the 1939 stage adaptation by Alec Guinness, which provided the inspiration and template for Lean&#x27;s film. Her performance met with significant acclaim, and Roger Ebert later wrote in 1999 that she &quot;dominate[d] the [film&#x27;s] early scenes, playing Miss Havisham as a beak-nosed, shabby figure, bedecked in crumbling lace and linen, not undernourished despite her long exile.&quot;

===Later career===
Hunt acted in &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; in 1953 at the Phoenix Theatre. From this time on, she divided her time between British and American films, as well as the stage. She won a Tony Award in 1949 for her Broadway début as Countess Aurelia in the English-speaking première of Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (though she had relatively less impact on the production&#x27;s 1952 tour). Her last stage role was as Angélique Boniface in &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot;, an adaptation from Feydeau, again with Guinness at the Winter Garden Theatre in May 1956.

Other films in which she appeared included &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1948), &quot;The Fan&quot; (1949), &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1956), &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1956), &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; (1957), &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; (1960), &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (1962), &quot;Becket&quot; (1964), &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964) and &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; (1965). She also appeared on television as Lady Bastable in several adaptations of the Saki stories (1962).

==Death==
Martita Hunt died of bronchial asthma at her home in Hampstead, London, aged 69, on 13 June 1969. Her estate was valued at £5,390. She never married.

She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 19 June. Her ashes lie in the Ivor Novello Rose Bed.

He is best known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as a wrestler and a road agent and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).

Although never a world champion, Malenko achieved championship success in ECW, WCW and the WWF, winning 11 total titles across the three organizations. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; named Malenko the #1 wrestler in the world in 1997, and he was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame in 2015. He has been described by commentators as one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time. Multiple-time world champion Bryan Danielson said that his &quot;number one guy, growing up, was Dean Malenko&quot;. Following his retirement as an in-ring competitor, he worked as a road agent for WWE from 2001 until 2019.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early career (1979–1994)===
Malenko was born into a wrestling family, and his father Boris Malenko was a prominent wrestling figure. He started out as a referee in the Tampa area and even worked briefly as a referee for the WWF in the mid-1980s. He has wrestled all over the world and has spent much time wrestling in Mexico and Japan. He wrestled with his brother Joe Malenko from 1988 to 1992, forming a tag team working in Puerto Rico, Japan, and Australia until his brother retired. On January 24, 1992, Malenko defeated &quot;The Superstar&quot; for the Suncoast Pro Wrestling (SPW) Southern title in Palmetto, Florida. Malenko defeated Jimmy Backlund for the ICWA Light Heavyweight title on March 12, 1992, in Tampa. Then, Malenko teamed with his brother losing to Ricky Steamboat and Nikita Koloff at Clash of the Champions XIX.

===Eastern Championship Wrestling / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994–1995)===

On August 27, 1994, Malenko debuted in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a heel participating in a professional wrestling tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Osamu Nishimura in the quarterfinals before he ended up losing to the eventual winner Shane Douglas in the semifinals. Malenko became known as &quot;The Shooter&quot; and was given a gimmick similar to an Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter (due to his resemblance to Royce Gracie). On November 4, 1994, he defeated 2 Cold Scorpio to win his first ECW Television Championship.

In the beginning of 1995, Malenko formed a faction called the Triple Threat with Chris Benoit and Shane Douglas. On February 25, 1995, at Return of the Funker, Benoit and Malenko defeated Sabu and Tazmaniac for the ECW Tag Team Championship, making Malenko a double champion. A month later at Extreme Warfare, Malenko dropped the Television title to 2 Cold Scorpio. On April 8 at Three Way Dance, he and Benoit lost the tag titles to The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock).

In the summer of 1995, Malenko feuded with TV Champion Eddie Guerrero, culminating in a match on July 21 where Malenko defeated Guerrero to win his second ECW Television Championship. Only a week later, Malenko dropped the title back to Guerrero. The two continued to battle over the Television Title and fought a series of matches that led to them being offered a WCW contract. His last ECW match was a two out of three falls match against Guerrero, which took place on August 26. The match ended in a draw as the last fall had both men&#x27;s shoulders on the mat. This would be both men&#x27;s last match in ECW and they both gave—and received—an emotional farewell to the fans.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–2000)===
====Cruiserweight Champion; United States Heavyweight Champion (1995–1998)====
In September 1995, Malenko and Benoit joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he continued to be a villain. Malenko came to be known in WCW as &quot;The Iceman&quot; Dean Malenko because of his cold, calculating demeanor and was also given the nickname of &quot;The Man of 1,000 Holds&quot;. On May 2, 1996, Malenko defeated Shinjiro Otani for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship in Orlando. He held the title for two months, making successful defenses against the likes of Brad Armstrong, Rey Mysterio Jr. and Disco Inferno before losing the title to Mysterio on the July, 8 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;. He defeated Mysterio Jr. for his second WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Halloween Havoc 1996.

After a successful title defense against Psychosis at World War 3, Malenko lost the Cruiserweight title to Ultimate Dragon (Último Dragón) at Starrcade 1996 where Dragón&#x27;s J-Crown Championship was also on the line. Malenko defeated Dragón on the January 22, 1997 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIV&quot; to win his third WCW Cruiserweight Championship. He would hold the belt for nearly a month before losing it to Syxx at SuperBrawl VII. Malenko lost the match after Eddie Guerrero inadvertently caused Malenko to be hit with Guerrero&#x27;s United States Title belt.

Malenko then entered a feud with Guerrero, angry over the fact that he had caused him to lose his Cruiserweight belt and began to attempt to win the United States title from him. The match between the two took place at &quot;Uncensored&quot; the next month and interference from Syxx played a role again. The Cruiserweight Champion again tried to take Guerrero&#x27;s title, but in the process dropped the camcorder he carried to the ring with him. After Guerrero took the belt back, Malenko hit him in the back of the head with the camcorder and knocked the champion out, enabling him to pin Guerrero and win his first United States Championship. He retained the belt at &quot;Slamboree&quot; on May 18, 1997, by defeating Jeff Jarrett, but lost the title to him on the June 9, 1997, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. At World War 3, Malenko participated in a 60-man, three-ring battle royal won by The Giant. At Starrcade 1997, he challenged Guerrero for the Cruiserweight Title but ended up losing the match. 

In mid-1998, Malenko engaged in a heated feud with Chris Jericho. To better Malenko&#x27;s claims, Jericho boasted that he was &quot;The Man of 1,004 Holds&quot; and the two had a final showdown at Uncensored 1998 for the Cruiserweight title. After a long match, Jericho forced Malenko to submit in an angled Liontamer. After the match, the otherwise collected Malenko was left in an unusual fit of frustration. Gene Okerlund then confronted Malenko post-match, aggressively citing his many losses in the past several months and asking where he would go from this point. Dejected and worn down, Malenko replied simply, &quot;Home,&quot; and would not be seen on WCW TV for two months. In the ensuing two months, Jericho proceeded to mercilessly taunt Malenko, including insulting Malenko&#x27;s father and attacking Malenko&#x27;s brother. At Slamboree 1998, Jericho held a Battle Royal for a shot at his Cruiserweight Championship. Malenko entered the battle royal dressed as masked wrestler Ciclope and won the match, after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand, and eliminated himself. He then unmasked, revealing himself to the crowd following his win. Malenko went on to defeat Jericho for his fourth and final WCW Cruiserweight Championship, thus becoming the first-ever wrestler to win the Cruiserweight title four times. Malenko was stripped of the title, however, as he did not earn the title shot as himself. At The Great American Bash 1998, Malenko and Jericho faced each other in a match for the vacant Cruiserweight title. Malenko lost by disqualification, making Jericho the champion. At Bash at the Beach 1998, Malenko interfered in Jericho&#x27;s title defense against Rey Mysterio Jr. allowing Mysterio to pin Jericho for the title. The title was returned to Jericho, however, because of interference by Malenko. Malenko was fired in storyline, but returned at Road Wild 1998 as the special guest referee during Jericho&#x27;s defense against Juventud Guerrera. Juventud won the match and the title.

====The Four Horsemen; The Revolution (1998–2000)====

In September 1998, Malenko became a part of the final incarnation of Ric Flair&#x27;s Four Horsemen faction. They feuded with the New World Order (nWo), particularly Eric Bischoff. Malenko and Benoit also battled The West Texas Rednecks (Curt Hennig and Barry Windham) during this period. At SuperBrawl IX, they lost to the Rednecks in the finals of a tag team tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship. At Uncensored 1999, however, they defeated the Rednecks in a lumberjack match to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Two weeks later, they lost the titles to Rey Mysterio Jr. and Billy Kidman.

After the Horsemen were finally disbanded in May 1999 due to Flair&#x27;s abuse of power, Malenko joined up with Shane Douglas&#x27; faction, The Revolution, which was formed in July 1999. They feuded with David Flair, Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon. At Bash at the Beach (1999), Malenko challenged David for the US title but lost the match. They battled many teams throughout the year including West Texas Rednecks, First Family, The Filthy Animals and The Varsity Club. 

Malenko&#x27;s last WCW match was a &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot; match with Billy Kidman at Souled Out in January 2000. Early on, Malenko instinctively left the ring to regroup and was disqualified under the match stipulations because his feet hit the arena floor.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2000–2019)===
====The Radicalz; Light Heavyweight Champion (2000–2001)====

After being granted his release from WCW the night after his last WCW match, Malenko signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and debuted during the Attitude Era on January 31, 2000, edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. Malenko first appeared in the crowd with the infamous Radicalz – himself, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, and Perry Saturn – who all made exits from WCW at the same time. While not having as much success in the WWF, Malenko was a force in the promotion&#x27;s light heavyweight division. Along with Guerrero, Benoit, and Saturn, he had some measure of success as part of The Radicalz. On the March 13 edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Malenko defeated Essa Rios for his first Light Heavyweight Championship. In April 2000, he feuded with Scotty 2 Hotty who was the new challenger for his Light Heavyweight title. He dropped the title to Scotty on the April 17 edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; before he won his second WWF Light Heavyweight Championship from Scotty on the April 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At Backlash 2000, Malenko successfully defended the title against Scotty, thus ending the feud between the two.

Later that year, with Benoit having drifted away from the group, Malenko engaged in a feud with Guerrero and Saturn which stemmed from Guerrero&#x27;s on-screen relationship with Chyna and a number of losses suffered when working as a tag team with Saturn. The feud led to a triple threat match at Judgment Day 2000 where Guerrero retained the WWF European Championship against both Malenko and Saturn. After a brief absence from TV, Malenko returned to reform The Radicalz with Guerrero, Benoit, and Saturn. Around this time, Malenko briefly became known as &quot;Double Ho Seven&quot;, a parody of the fictional character, James Bond. The gimmick was born out of a match with The Godfather, who offered one of his female escorts to Malenko instead of wrestling him. Malenko gladly accepted his opponent&#x27;s offer. As Double Ho Seven, Malenko competed for the affections of Lita and feuded with her tag team the Hardy Boyz. He even offered Lita a title match for his Light Heavyweight Championship, but under the condition that if she lost she would be obliged to go on a date with him. Lita accepted and almost caught Malenko by a few nearfalls throughout the match, but in the end lost the match by submitting to his signature Cloverleaf.

Malenko&#x27;s feud with the Hardy Boyz and Lita continued in early 2001, culminating with Lita pinning him (with some assistance from Matt Hardy) in a match on the February 19, 2001, edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. He also briefly feuded with Jacqueline and Ivory, who were disgusted by his lecherous ways. A title feud with Crash Holly would begin after Crash interfered in a two-on-one intergender handicap match between Malenko, and both Jacqueline and Ivory, costing him the match. After both Guerrero and Benoit drifted away from the Radicalz, Malenko teamed with Saturn for a few weeks before quietly disappearing off television as the WCW/ECW Invasion storyline began in summer 2001.

====Retirement (2001–2019)====
Malenko&#x27;s third-last wrestling match took place at the 4th Annual Brian Pillman Memorial Show in August 2001, where he teamed with longtime friend Perry Saturn and defeated Raven and Justin Credible. That December, he defeated his student, Chad Collyer, by disqualification in the WWF farm promotion, the Heartland Wrestling Association, in what was Malenko&#x27;s final match. Malenko appeared in the ring along with other WWE alumni during WWE Raw Homecoming on October 3, 2005.

His close friend Eddie Guerrero died on November 13, 2005, and Malenko made a special appearance on the November 14 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; alongside Chris Benoit. The following Friday on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Malenko once again appeared after a match between Chris Benoit and Triple H, and the three embraced. After the 2006 Royal Rumble, he was seen congratulating Rey Mysterio on his Rumble victory. At in June 2007, he appeared in a backstage segment watching Chavo Guerrero Jr.. The next night on the Chris Benoit memorial episode of Monday Night Raw, he talked about the life of Chris Benoit. He was very sad since two of his close friends, Eddie and Benoit, both died, but said he was happy that they were together again.

Malenko next appeared on the March 31, 2008, episode of Raw to join The Four Horsemen and other WWE superstars in a farewell tribute to Ric Flair. He made an appearance on the June 28, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; congratulating Ricky Steamboat on his DVD release. He and all the others in the ring were attacked by the Nexus. Malenko appeared along the rest of the WWE roster after the April 23, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to celebrate John Cena&#x27;s 35th birthday. In November 2015, Malenko was inducted into 2300 Arena Hardcore Hall of Fame. On the September 11, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Malenko made a brief backstage appearance alongside Jamie Noble, where the two were seen as possible choices by Raw Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose as their partners for an eight-man tag-team match, but were quickly dismissed. On the June 5, 2018, episode of &quot;Smackdown Live&quot;, Malenko appeared during the contract signing between AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura.

On April 26, 2019, Malenko and WWE ended their working relationship. This came after Malenko was a road agent for them for the previous 18 years. Pro Wrestling Insider would later report that he did not do anything wrong, WWE was just in the process of cycling out some of the older agents, due to the recent signings of multiple new agents.

===All Elite Wrestling (2019–present)===
On May 24, 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) announced that Malenko had joined them as a senior producer, which he makes occasional appearances on TNT since his last match on the December 27, 1999, episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. He made an appearance in Philadelphia following the October 8, 2021, edition of &quot;Rampage&quot; when Tony Khan called him out alongside Jerry Lynn, Taz and Chris Jericho to thank them for inspiring him.

<text>The Stort Navigation is the canalised section of the River Stort running from the town of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hertfordshire, downstream to its confluence with the Lee Navigation at Feildes Weir near Rye House, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.

==History==
With the growth of the malt trade in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford in the early eighteenth century, attention turned to providing better transport facilities. The River Stort joined the River Lea, and the malt trade at Ware had benefitted from improvements made on that river. A similar solution was therefore sought for the Stort, and a public meeting was held on 11 December 1758. The chief promoter seems to have been Thomas Adderley. A bill was duly submitted to parliament, and became an Act of Parliament in March 1759. It was entitled &quot;An Act for making the River Stort navigable, in the counties of Hertford and Essex, from the New Bridge, in the town of Bishop Stortford, into the River Lea, near a Place called the Rye, in the county of Hertford&quot;. Commissioners were appointed to oversee the work and to raise the capital to fund the project. They failed in this duty, and the powers of the first act lapsed, as it imposed time limits during which the work had to be completed.

A second Act of Parliament was sought after three men proposed to the Commissioners that they would fund the scheme in return for the tolls. This met with the Commissioners&#x27; approval, and the new Act was obtained on 30 March 1766. It was entitled &quot;An Act for making and continuing navigable the River Stort, in the counties of Hertford and Essex&quot;, and it empowered Charles Dingley, George Jackson and William Masterson to build the Navigation and to collect tolls. They had five years to complete the work, and the powers of the first Act were repealed by the second. Work began on 24 September, under the direction of Thomas Yeoman, who was also the surveyor for the Lee Navigation, and was completed in autumn 1769. The navigation, which included fifteen locks, was officially opened on 24 October 1769.

In 1796, Jackson issued a Stort halfpenny token for use on the Navigation. The reverse shows the course of the river with a horse-drawn barge in the foreground. It was struck by Matthew Boulton in mid-1796, despite the date on the piece (1795). Conrad Heinrich Küchler was the designer.

Because the navigation was privately funded, there is no record of the actual cost, but Jackson, speaking in 1812 and by then named Sir George Duckett, stated that it had not been a good business proposition. The Lee Navigation paid the proprietors £105 in 1774, for improvements made to the junction between the two rivers. Trade increased gradually, rising from around 18,000 or 19,000 tons in 1791 to 40,000 tons in 1811.

===Table of tolls===
The tolls specified by the enabling Act of Parliament were as follows.
&quot;And so in proportion for any less Quantity.&quot;

&quot;Boats returning with a back lading of Oil-cake, Malt-dust, Pigeon Dung or any other Kind of Manure, which have passed up or down the River immediately before, and paid the Tolls or Rates on their Cargoes, shall be exempted from Tonnage Rate on such Manure.&quot;

===Development===
Once the Stort was navigable to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, there was interest in making it part of a larger network. The City of London&#x27;s Thames and Canal Committee appointed the engineer Robert Whitworth to survey a route for a canal between Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Cambridge. He was to produce a report, including an estimate of the cost of construction, and give his opinion on whether any other route to Cambridge might be better. Although he was asked to do this in November 1779, it was more than a year until he produced the report, which was published on 6 December 1780. His plan followed the obvious route, passing up the Stort valley, and crossing into the Granta valley to reach Cambridge. However, this involved passing in front of Audley End, the home of Lord Howard de Walden, who vehemently opposed the scheme. A public meeting held in November 1781 ended in disarray, and no further action was taken at the time.

John Phillips was next to revive the plan in 1785, although it was a small part of a grand scheme to link London to Kings Lynn. He hoped to avoid the opposition experienced previously by routing his Bishop&#x27;s Stortford to Cambridge link to the west of the Shotgrove and Audley End estates. He did not find favour because his costings were thought to be wildly optimistic. George Jackson proposed a route to the Thames and Canal Committee in 1788, which passed behind Audley End and through Saffron Walden. This was surveyed by Samuel Weston, as Whitworth was busy in Scotland. Lord Howard opposed this route, too, as did the Bedford Level Corporation. In 1789, a line proposed by John Rennie was considered, which would have passed through Saffron Walden to join the River Little Ouse near Wilton Ferry. A bill was presented to Parliament, but was withdrawn in the face of serious opposition.
The next attempt was made in 1811, with Jackson, now called Sir George Duckett, driving the plan. A bill was introduced to Parliament, but was defeated in committee. A second bill was introduced in January 1812, with some modifications, and despite organised opposition, became an act of Parliament, the &#x27; on 9 June 1812. It authorised the raising of £870,000 for the project, which included 52 locks on the main line, 13 on a branch to Whaddon, and three tunnels. Work could not be started until £425,250 had been raised. However, only £121,300 was subscribed, and so a second act, the &#x27; (54 Geo. 3. c. clxviii) was obtained, to authorise just the sections from the River Cam to Saffron Walden, and the branch to Whaddon. Despite the authorisation, no work was ever done, and the idea of the London and Cambridge Junction Canal faded away.

===Operation===
A change of ownership occurred in 1832, when the bankers Duckett, Morland and Company failed, and Sir George Duckett, the son of one of the original three funders, became bankrupt. At the time, the annual income from tolls was around £5,000, and the whole concern was estimated to be worth £150,000. It passed to a firm called Birbecks, who had loaned the company £40,000 but then foreclosed the mortgage. They then passed it on to Gurney and Co., who were bankers based in Norwich.

In May 1842 the Northern and Eastern Railway opened a line to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, which followed the valley of the Stort, and had stations almost on the banks of the navigation. The effect on trade was dramatic, with income dropping from £5,477 to £2,593 in the ten years between 1838 and 1848. The decline then stopped, and the Lee Navigation gave serious thought to purchasing their neighbour. Acts of Parliament obtained by them in 1868 and 1874 included powers to authorise the acquisition, but surveys were made, and the amount of repairs and dredging that would be required persuaded them to only offer a small sum, which was rejected. Gurney and Co. sold it in 1873 to a firm of brewers from Spitalfields called Truman, Hanbury and Co. Sir Walter Gilbey took it over next, and formed the Stort Navigation Company Ltd in 1905, a company in which most of the directors were members of his own family.

With income dropping, Gilbey began negotiating with the Lee Navigation. Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Urban District Council offered £170 towards its purchase, on condition that other local authorities should also contribute. Later that year, one side of Brick Lock at Roydon collapsed. As it was the second lock above the junction with the Lee, nearly all the barges that operated on the Navigation were trapped above it. Gilbey offered the Navigation to the Lee Navigation for a small fee. Although the deal was not finalised, they sent extra men to assist the six already employed on rebuilding the lock, and it reopened on 4 October 1909. Another assessment by the Lee Conservancy Board estimated that £10,800 was needed to put it back into good order, and noted that income had dropped from £927 to £319 between 1901 and 1907. Eventually Gilbey gave in, and the Lee Conservancy Board took ownership on 1 June 1911, having paid just five shillings (25p) for it.

Prior to the takeover, the Lee Conservators had applied for a loan under the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909, and were granted five annual payments of £2,500, to be repaid when profits were made. Work began on rebuilding the locks in 1913, but the onset of the First World War in 1914 resulted in all work stopping, except for urgent repairs. It resumed when the war ended, and the navigation was reopened on 4 July 1924, the ceremony being performed by Harry Gosling, the Minister of Transport. Some traffic returned to the navigation, as trade in timber, grain and malt grew, but it died away after the Second World War, and the last commercial traffic was in 1972. However, the growth in leisure boating was already well under way, and the navigation has seen a new lease of life as a result.

==Present day==
The 15 locks (see table) are built to take boats by , which means that they are not quite wide enough to take two narrow boats at a time. The Navigation is now managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust as successor to British Waterways.
There is a towpath along the entire length of the navigation, which forms part of a number of long-distance walks. The Stort Valley Way is a circular walk, while the Three Forests Way is a circular walk, passing through Hatfield Forest, Hainault Forest and Epping Forest. It was devised by the West Essex Group of the Ramblers Association, as a way to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Route==
The navigation begins in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, just to the south of the A1250 Hockerill Bridge. It receives its water supply from the upper River Stort, which rises as a series of streams near Langley, some to the north. Nearby and to the east is Bishop&#x27;s Stortford railway station, on the to line. Both bear south, and the railway crosses to the west bank. South Mill lock marks the start of the descent, and beyond it are watermeadows and Rushy Mead Nature Reserve, an site run by Essex Wildlife Trust which was the location of a sewage pumping station prior to 1950. After Twyford Lock, it passes below Wallbury Camp, on the east bank. This is an iron-age hill fort, and is a scheduled ancient monument. Spellbrook Lock and Tadnambury Lock follow shortly afterwards. The river flows around Tadnambury Lock in a large loop, on which Hallingbury Mill is located. It was built in 1874, and there is a granary built on the site of the original mill which was demolished in 1885. The breast-shot waterwheel is wide and in diameter. The Grade II* listed mill was restored in the late 1960s, and is now a hotel and bistro. The railway crosses back to the east bank, as the navigation enters Sawbridgeworth.
Sawbridgeworth Lock is located on the northern edge of the town, where both the timber-framed and weatherboarded mill house, and the nearby grain store, date from the 18th century and are Grade II listed. Sheering Mill Lock is to the east, where the navigation is sandwiched between the village of Lower Sheering and the town. The mill house here dates from the 17th century, and is timber framed with exterior plasterwork. It was extended in the 19th and 20th centuries, and contains reproduction features, which make the historical evidence more difficult to decipher. Below Sawbridgeworth is Feakes Lock, where the navigation turns towards the south-west. As it does so, it forms the eastern edge of the Pishiobury Estate, a country house and landscaped park containing gardens from the 16th century and later. The Grade II listed grounds include formal canals, and the landscaping is attributed to Capability Brown.

On the northern edge of Harlow, it passes under the A1184 road, which is immediately followed by Harlow Lock. The adjacent mill probably dates from the 17th century, but gives few clues to its age. It is now a restaurant. The railway separates the navigation from the town. There are no significant buildings at Latton Lock or Burnt Mill Lock, but there is a mill building at Parndon Lock, dating from the mid- or late-19th century. It used both water power and steam power, although none of the machinery survives except a water turbine. The mill house is somewhat older, dating from the mid-18th century, and is a three-storey brick building, the front of which is rendered.

Near Hunston Mill Lock is the brick base of a watermill, which was demolished in 1902, and a brick bridge with abutments. There was a mill on the site in 1066. Some 19th century cast-iron sluices still control water flow through the site. The adjacent mill house with its stables, coach house and walls are all Grade II listed. The house dates from the 17th century, although it was faced with brick and extended in the 19th century, and extended again in 1912. To the west is Briggens, an 18th-century house with landscaped gardens designed by Charles Bridgeman around 1720, which also has some Edwardian pleasure gardens. The house is now a hotel, and there is a golf course in part of the gardens, although most of the 18th century landscape features have been retained.

Just after Roydon Lock, the railway crosses from the south bank to the north on a low bridge. Roydon railway station is very close to the navigation, although its attractive timber-framed and plastered buildings dating from 1844 face away from the river. The navigation now enters the Lee Valley Regional Park and threads its way between flooded gravel pits and Rye Meads sewage treatment works to the north. Just above Brick Lock, the three-storey Roydon mill building is constructed of yellow bricks for the first two storeys, while the third storey is made of weatherboarding on a timber frame. At the lock, the lock-keepers cottage, dating from 1830, still stands. It is constructed of painted brick with a slate roof, and carries an oval plaque with the text &quot;G.D. 1830&quot;. This celebrates Sir George Duckett, who was responsible for the construction of the waterway. The final lock is Lower Lock, after which the navigation joins the Lee Navigation, just to the north of Feilde&#x27;s Weir Lock.

<doc id="998647" wikidata="Q441228" url="?curid=998647" title="William George Horner">
<text>William George Horner (9 June 1786 – 22 September 1837) was a British mathematician. Proficient in classics and mathematics, he was a schoolmaster, headmaster and schoolkeeper who wrote extensively on functional equations, number theory and approximation theory, but also on optics. His contribution to approximation theory is honoured in the designation Horner&#x27;s method, in particular respect of a paper in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; for 1819. The modern invention of the zoetrope, under the name &quot;Daedaleum&quot; in 1834, has been attributed to him.

Horner died comparatively young, before the establishment of specialist, regular scientific periodicals. So, the way others have written about him has tended to diverge, sometimes markedly, from his own prolific, if dispersed, record of publications and the contemporary reception of them.

==Family life==
The eldest son of the Rev. William Horner, a Wesleyan minister, Horner was born in Bristol. He was educated at Kingswood School, a Wesleyan foundation near Bristol, and at the age of sixteen became an assistant master there. In four years he rose to be headmaster (1806), but left in 1809, setting up his own school, The Classical Seminary, at Grosvenor Place, Bath, which he kept until he died there 22 September 1837. He and his wife Sarah (1787?–1864) had six daughters and two sons.

==Physical sciences, optics==
Although Horner&#x27;s article on the Dædalum (zoetrope) appeared in &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; only in January, 1834, he had published on Camera lucida as early as August, 1815.

==Mathematics==
Horner&#x27;s name first appears in the list of solvers of the mathematical problems in The Ladies&#x27; Diary: or, Woman&#x27;s Almanack for 1811, continuing in the successive annual issues until that for 1817. Up until the issue for 1816, he is listed as solving all but a few of the fifteen problems each year; several of his answers were printed, along with two problems he proposed. He also contributed to other departments of the Diary, not without distinction, reflecting the fact that he was known to be an all-rounder, competent in the classics as well as in mathematics. Horner was ever vigilant in his reading, as shown by his characteristic return to the Diary for 1821 in a discussion of the Prize Problem, where he reminds readers of an item in (Thomson&#x27;s) &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot; for 1817; several other problems in the Diary that year were solved by his youngest brother, Joseph.

His record in The Gentleman&#x27;s Diary: or, Mathematical Repository for this period is similar, including one of two published modes of proof in the volume for 1815 of a problem posed the previous year by Thomas Scurr (d. 1836), now dubbed the Butterfly theorem. Leaving the headmastership of Kingswood School would have given him more time for this work, while the appearance of his name in these publications, which were favoured by a network of mathematics teachers, would have helped publicize his own school.

At this stage, Horner&#x27;s efforts turned more to &quot;The Mathematical Repository&quot;, edited by Thomas Leybourn, but to contributing occasional articles, rather than the problem section,
as well as to &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot;, where Horner begins by responding to other contributors and works up to independent articles of his own; he has a careful style with acknowledgements and, more often than not, cannot resist adding further detail.

Several contributions pave the way for, or are otherwise related to, his most celebrated mathematical paper, in &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot; in 1819, which was read by title at the closing meeting for the session on 1 July 1819, with Davies Gilbert in the Chair. The article, with significant editorial notes by Thomas Stephens Davies, was reprinted as a commemorative tribute in The Ladies&#x27; Diary for 1838. The issue of The Gentleman&#x27;s Diary for that year contains a short obituary notice. A careful analysis of this paper has appeared recently in Craig Smoryński&#x27;s &quot;History of Mathematics: A Supplement&quot;.

While a sequel was read before the Royal Society, publication was declined for &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, having to await appearance in a sequence of parts in the first two volumes of &quot;The Mathematician&quot; in the mid-1840s, again largely at the instigation of T. S. Davies.

However, Horner published on diverse topics in &quot;The Philosophical Magazine&quot; well into the 1830s. Davies mooted an edition of Horner&#x27;s collected papers, but this project never came to fruition, partly on account of Davies&#x27; own early death.

<text>The Jirel () is one of the 59 ethnic/indegenious people in Nepal.They call themselves &quot;Jiriba&quot;, which means &quot;people from the mountain of life.&quot; Jiriba believe that they migrated to Nepal, Jiri, and Dolakha from Tibet from the north in the ancient time crossing the pass near to Gauri Shankar mountain. The name of the mountain Gaurishankar in Jiriba or Jirel is &quot;Tsheri/ziri&quot;. In Jirel language &quot;Zi/Tshe&quot; means life or light and &quot;Ri&quot; means mountain. Jiriba means &quot;the People from the life mountain&quot;. They are the original inhabitants of vast Jiri and its adjoining villages in Dolkha district, the central region of Nepal. They have their own distinct language, culture, customs, rituals and lifestyles. In the beginning They were bon practising phonbo &quot;bonpo&quot;. They are now mostly Buddhist but many of the Jirel adhere to other religions, like Christianity, Islam and Hinduism. 

They were &quot;Phon&#x27; or &quot;Bon&quot; which also is in practice in tibetan known as &quot;Bonpo&quot; religion worldwide. Their indigenous shamanistic religious beliefs are centered on practitioners called Phonbo, &quot;Shamans&quot; who are believed to have a direct relationship with the supernatural world. Their main occupation is agriculture and animal husbandry. In recent years they have also been involved in business, government, and teaching jobs. Many of the Jirel are in the British Gurkha Army, Indian Army, Nepalese Army, and the police. They are primarily settled in Dolakha, Sindhupalchowk Chitwan, and Ilam districts, next to Likhu, Khimti, the Jiri and Jiri Shikri rivers. Jirels have linguistic and ethnic semblance mostly with the tribes of Central Tibet (Lhasa), also with Sherpas, Dolpos, Hyalmus, Syubas, Lhomis, Bhotes in Nepal. Jirels have their own mother tongue which is called &quot;Jirpa Kecha&quot;, and belongs to the Tibetan language family.

<text>William James McBride CBE, better known as Willie John McBride (born 6 June 1940), is a former rugby union footballer from Northern Ireland who played as a lock for Ireland and the British and Irish Lions. He made 63 appearances for Ireland, including eleven as captain, and toured with the Lions five times; a record that earned him 17 Lions Test caps. He also captained one of the most successful Lions sides, which returned undefeated from South Africa in 1974. McBride, inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2009, is regarded as one of the most influential figures ever to play the game.

==Youth==
McBride was born in Toomebridge, County Antrim. Owing to his father&#x27;s death when he was four years old, he spent most of his spare time helping out on his family farm. Because of this he did not start playing rugby until he was 17. He was educated at Ballymena Academy and played for the school&#x27;s First XV. After he left he joined Ballymena

==Playing career==
In 1962 McBride was selected to play for Ireland. His first Test on 10 February 1962 was against England at Twickenham. Later that year he was selected to tour South Africa with the British and Irish Lions.

McBride continued to play for Ireland throughout the 1960s and played for Ireland when they first defeated South Africa (the &quot;Springboks&quot;) in 1965, and when Ireland defeated Australia in Sydney — the first time a Home Nations team had defeated a major southern hemisphere team in their own country. He was again selected for the Lions in 1966, this time touring New Zealand and Australia. He toured South Africa with the Lions again in 1968.

He was selected to play for the Lions in their 1971 tour of New Zealand. Despite being criticized by some as being &quot;over the hill&quot;, McBride was made pack leader and helped the Lions to a Test series win over New Zealand; their first and last series win over New Zealand. He received an MBE in 1971 for services to rugby football.

==1974 Lions tour to South Africa==
McBride&#x27;s leadership qualities led to his appointment as captain of the British and Irish Lions in their 1974 tour to South Africa. The Test series was won 3–0, with one match drawn; the first Lions series ever won in South Africa. It was one of the most controversial and physical Test match series ever played. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, and so decided to match fire with fire. Willie John McBride instigated a policy of &quot;one in, all in&quot;: that is, when one Lion retaliated, all other Lions were expected to join in the melee or hit the nearest Springbok.

At that time there were only substitutions if a doctor agreed that a player was physically unable to continue and there were no video cameras and sideline officials to keep the punching, kicking and head butting to a minimum. If the South Africans were to resort to foul play then the Lions decided &quot;to get their retaliation in first.&quot; The signal for this was to call &quot;99&quot; (a shortened version of the emergency number in Ireland and in the United Kingdom: 999). This was a signal for the Lions to clobber their nearest rival players.

==Retirement==
In 1975 as his international career was ending he played his last game for Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The game was against France, and near the end of the match he scored his first test try for Ireland. It was the crowning moment of a great playing career. His last international game was against Wales on Saturday 15 March 1975.

After retiring from playing the game, McBride coached the Irish team and was manager of the 1983 Lions tour to New Zealand. Despite the test results being mainly poor, team camaraderie was high and some good wins were recorded in other games. In 1997 he was an inaugural inductee into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He lives in Ballyclare. He has been asked to present Test jerseys and give motivational speeches to Lions players prior to matches. In 2004 he was named in Rugby World magazine as &quot;Rugby Personality of the Century&quot;. He is a major supporter of the Wooden Spoon Society.

McBride was awarded a CBE in the 2019 New Year Honours list for services to Rugby Union.

<doc id="998671" wikidata="Q2499228" url="?curid=998671" title="Distrito Nacional">
<text>The Distrito Nacional (; D.N.) is a subdivision of the Dominican Republic enclosing the capital Santo Domingo. It is not in any of the provinces, but in practice, it acts as a province on its own. Before 16 October 2001, the Distrito Nacional was much larger, including what is now known as Santo Domingo Province. Published statistics and maps generally show the former, larger, Distrito Nacional. The Distrito Nacional has no rural or underdeveloped areas.

==Points of interest==

===Poligono Central===

The Poligono Central is the central area of Santo Domingo. Upscale neighborhoods of Naco, Piantini, and Paraiso are located within this central polygon. Most of the financial activity in Santo Domingo is also located in the &quot;Poligono&quot;.

===Central Government===

The Distrito Nacional houses the central government&#x27;s executive branch Presidential Office (&quot;Palacio Nacional&quot;), the national congressional building (&quot;Congreso Nacional&quot;) and the top judicial court building (&quot;Suprema Corte de Justicia&quot;). It also houses all the nationwide public office&#x27;s main buildings, called &quot;Ministerios&quot; (formerly &quot;Secretarías de Estado&quot;).

===Ciudad Colonial===
&quot;For the main article, please select Ciudad Colonial.&quot;

The &quot;Ciudad Colonial&quot; (lit. &quot;Colonial City&quot;) is the oldest continually occupied European settlement in the Western hemisphere, established by Bartholomew Columbus and the Spanish explorers in the New World. It has several historic landmarks and is declared as World Heritage Site by the UNESCO.

===Nightlife===
There are various nightlife activities available inside the Distrito Nacional. Upscale nightclubs, casinos, hotels, restaurants with international bars are widely available. Discothèque DJs and live performances caters both local sounds (merengue, salsa or bachata) and dance music (house, techno, trance, reggaeton, drum and bass, etc.) Most nightclubs alternate between the two main genres; some other clubs stick almost exclusively to either one. Several chain restaurants are available serving dinner up to midnight. Most restaurants within hotels don&#x27;t close at all, and the majority of casinos serve complimentary snacks all night. Most restaurants are specialized on the following cuisines: Local, Italian, French, Steakhouse, Mexican, Spanish, Seafood, Chinese and Japanese). There are several movie cinemas that play movies in English (with subtitles) and are on par with worldwide premiers. Jazz music outlets, live theater, live concerts and sports events are available throghtout the whole week.

===Parks===
Distrito Nacional has several urban parks, the largest one, &quot;Parque Mirador Sur&quot;, overlooking the Caribbean Sea from a high cliff from the &quot;Avenida Mirador Sur&quot; (also called &quot;Avenida de la Salud&quot; - Health Avenue). It has several miles of open road designed for picnic, jogging and cycling. Roller skating and even Kendo are regularly practiced in areas of the park.

Other places in the area include:
* Plaza de la Cultura Juan Pablo Duarte - which houses several national museums and is host of the International Book Fair. It houses the Teatro Nacional. The Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional holds concerts under the direction of Maestro José Antonio Molina.
* Centro Olímpico Juan Pablo Duarte - Olympic facility in the center of the city. It includes the Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez.
* Estadio Quisqueya - baseball stadium, home of two national teams: Tigres del Licey and Leones del Escogido. The former is the winningest team of the Caribbean Series.

===Shopping===
There are several shopping malls that represent international brands of clothing, electronic goods, gifts and the like. Banks, barber shops, internet cafés, travel agencies, dental offices and supermarkets can all be found under a single roof.

===Schools===
There are plenty of public (government funded) and private schools that offer teaching in both Spanish and English. Among the public universities is the first university of the Americas, Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, located near the center-south of the city. The first private university, Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra, has a campus nearby.

==Transportation==

===Metro de Santo Domingo===
The Distrito Nacional boasts the first and only underground public transportation system in the country. The first line connects the Distrito Nacional with Santo Domingo Norte.

===Public transportation===
Other means of public transportation include: taxi services, public bus routes, urban transportation by bus, local airports and rent cars. International flights are handled by the nearby Las Américas International Airport and La Isabela airport. It can be reached from the city center through some 20 miles of recently expanded expressway and new suspension bridge (Puente Presidente Juan Bosch).

==Politics==
The Distrito Nacional is represented in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies on the same scale as a Province (a single Senator (&quot;Senador&quot;), plus one Deputy (&quot;Diputado&quot;) per 50,000 inhabitants). Its local government is the same as the provincial &quot;municipios&quot;, without the equivalent of a provincial tier of government.
==Sectores (neighborhoods)==

The Distrito Nacional is subdivided in incorporated areas (neighborhoods) called &quot;sectores&quot; which could be considered as small urban towns. All &quot;sectores&quot; are serviced directly by the municipal mayor&#x27;s office (&quot;Alcalde&quot;).

Some sectores prefixes:
* &quot;Ciudad (city)&quot; - applies to the original older parts of town, some dating back to colonial times of Dominican Republic.
* &quot;Ensanche&quot; (lit. &quot;widening&quot;) - usually, but not always, applied to the more &quot;modern&quot; parts of the city.
* &quot;Villa&quot; - the urban outskirts of both the old city of Santo Domingo and the current (smaller) Distrito Nacional.

<doc id="998680" wikidata="Q4925861" url="?curid=998680" title="Bledsoe, Texas">
<text>Bledsoe is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) in western Cochran County, Texas, United States, located near the New Mexico border. It is approximately 68 miles west of Lubbock. As of the 1990 US Census, the town had a population of 125.

== History ==
Bledsoe was founded in 1925 as the terminus of the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway, and named for Samuel T. Bledsoe, the line&#x27;s president. The town gained its original prosperity through its function as a cattle-shipping station, and reached its greatest population of 400 in 1930. The Great Depression had dire effect on the community and throughout the remainder of the 20th century the population continued to dwindle; the last recorded figure put the 1990 population at 125.

== Education ==
It is within the Whiteface Consolidated Independent School District. The former Bledsoe Independent School District merged into Whiteface CISD on July 1, 1996.

==Demographics==
Bledsoe first appeared as a census designated place in the 2020 U.S. Census.

<doc id="998696" wikidata="Q878392" url="?curid=998696" title="Magas of Cyrene">
<text>Magas of Cyrene (; born before 317 BC – 250 BC, ruled 276 BC – 250 BC) was a Greek King of Cyrenaica. Through his mother’s second marriage to Ptolemy I he became a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. He managed to wrest independence for Cyrenaica (in modern Libya) from the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt, and became King of Cyrenaica from 276 BC to 250 BC.

==Family background and early life==
Magas was the first-born son of the Macedonian noblewoman Berenice and her first husband, Philip, who had served as a military officer in the campaigns of Alexander the Great. He had two younger sisters: Antigone of Epirus and Theoxena of Syracuse. His father, Philip, was the son of Amyntas by a mother whose name is unknown. Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4) implies that his father was previously married and had children, including daughters born to him. Phillip served as a military officer in the service of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great and was known for commanding one division of the phalanx in Alexander’s wars.
Magas&#x27;s mother, Berenice, was from Eordeaea. She was the daughter of local obscure nobleman Magas and noblewoman Antigone. Berenice’s mother was the niece of the powerful regent Antipater and was a distant collateral relative to the Argead dynasty. He was the namesake of his maternal grandfather.

About 318 BC, Magas&#x27;s father, Philip, died of natural causes. After her husband&#x27;s death, Berenice took her children to the Ptolemaic Kingdom, where they were a part of the entourage of Berenice&#x27;s cousin Eurydice. Eurydice was then the wife of Ptolemy I, the first Greek pharaoh and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. 

By 317 BC, Ptolemy I fell in love with Berenice and repudiated Eurydice to marry her. Through her marriage to Ptolemy, Berenice became an Egyptian queen and the queen mother of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Magas was thus a stepson to Ptolemy I; he became an Egyptian prince living in his stepfather&#x27;s court and was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. His mother bore Ptolemy I three children: Queen Arsinoe II, Princess Philotera, and King Ptolemy II.

==Governorship and kingship of Cyrenaica==

Around five years after the death of the Cyrenese ruler Ophellas, Magas, then about 20 years old, received the governorship of Cyrenaica from the ruling Ptolemies in Egypt: his mother Queen Berenice I and his stepfather Ptolemy I.

As a posthumous honor to his biological father, Magas, when he served as a priest of the Greek God Apollo, had dedicated an honorific inscription proudly naming him as ‘the eponymous priest’ and ‘Magas son of Philip’. 

Following the death of his stepfather Ptolemy I in 283 BC, Magas tried on several occasions to wrest independence for Cyrenaica from his stepfather&#x27;s successor, his maternal half-brother Ptolemy Philadelphus, until he crowned himself King around 276 BC. It was the first time Cyrene had a king since Arcesilaus IV around 440 BC.
Magas then married Apama II, his third maternal cousin and one of the daughters of Seleucid King Antiochus I Soter and Stratonice of Syria. Antiochus I used his marital alliance to foment a pact to invade Egypt. Apama II and Magas had a daughter called Berenice II, who was their only child. 

Magas opened hostilities against Ptolemy II in 274 BC, attacking Egypt from the west, as Antiochus I was attacking Palestine. However, Magas had to cancel his operations due to an internal revolt of the Libyan nomad Marmaridae. In the east, Antiochus I suffered defeat against the armies of Ptolemy II. Magas at least managed to maintain the independence of Cyrenaica until his death in 250 BC. Magas betrothed his daughter Berenice II to Ptolemy III Euergetes, the son of Ptolemy II, as a way to seal an alliance between the two realms and secure the independence of Cyrene. 

After the death of Magas, Apama II broke the marital alliance between her daughter Berenice II and Ptolemy III and proposed her daughter and the throne to Demetrius the Fair, son of the Antigonid king Demetrius I Poliorcetes, who became the new king of Cyrene. This gave the Antigonids strategic control of the western side of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. After Demetrius was assassinated by Berenice for cheating 
with her mother Apama, Berenice returned to Egypt to finally marry her original fiancé, Ptolemy III Euergetes.

Magas is known to have favored the arts and sciences in Cyrene, and was close to the philosophical school of the Cyrenaics. The philosophy of the Cyrenaics under Magas evolved in a way that has similarities with Skepticism, Epicurianism and also Buddhism.

==Relations with India==

Magas was known by name to the contemporary Indian Emperor Ashoka, and he may have received Buddhist emissaries from India: indeed Magas is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist proselytism. Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of herbalism, for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic Kings.

There are no records of such emissaries in Western sources. However, the philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas ruled in Cyrenaica, is sometimes thought to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist missionaries, given the similarity of some of his teachings with Buddhism.

Still, Magas probably was quite knowledgeable about India. His father, Philip, had been a phalanx officer in the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Later, Magas, having been raised in part at the Ptolemaic court, must also have received first-hand accounts of India from his stepfather Ptolemy I, a former general in Alexander&#x27;s campaigns. The predecessor of Magas in Cyrene, the Ptolemaic governor named Ophellas, had also been one of the Alexander&#x27;s officers in India, in charge of one of his triremes during the expedition down the Indus River. Magas was probably quite acquainted with matters pertaining to India through his contacts with such veterans of the Indian campaigns.

<text>Wearside () is a built-up area in County Durham and Tyne and Wear, England. It is named after the River Wear which flows through it and traditionally all in the County of Durham. 

In the 2011 census, its official name was the Sunderland Built-up area since Sunderland is its largest part, the urban area extends to the surrounding City of Sunderland district, small parts of County Durham district and a small part of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. 

Notable towns in the urban area include Birtley, Chester le Street, Hetton le Hole, Houghton le Spring and Washington.

==Economy==
Like other parts of the North East, Wearside and Sunderland were economically structured by the primary and secondary sector of the economy; with a great deal of the economy once dependent on ship building at Sunderland Docks and coal mining with large collieries such as Monkwearmouth Colliery, which declined rapidly during the mid 20th century, many areas have long been deprived with vast areas of unemployment as a result. The city of Sunderland and parts of Wearside have been slowly rejuvenated over the years and industry is now largely based around call centres, although many areas such as Easington Colliery still face social problems today.

== Transport ==
==Media==
Serving Wearside, the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; newspaper is sold throughout the area and online. Local commercial radio is broadcast by 103.4 Sun FM for Wearside and 107 Spark FM for the City of Sunderland.

==Sport==
The Wearside Football League is one of the levels in the English football league system and contains amateur teams such as Easington Colliery A.F.C. and Seaham Red Star F.C. The only professional football team located in the area is Sunderland A.F.C., a team based in Sunderland.

==Sub-divisions==

According to the ONS definition the Wearside Built-up area (previously &quot;Urban area&quot;) had the following subdivisions. Note that these are &quot;Built-up areas subdivisions&quot; as defined by the Office for National Statistics and will have different boundaries from the settlements after which they are named.

<text>Perimeter College at Georgia State University is a college of Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia Perimeter College was originally a public community college founded by an Atlanta area county board of education before merging with Georgia State University in 2016 to create one of the largest universities in the United States with over 50,000 students. The Perimeter College (PC) campuses became components of Georgia State University, still maintaining their own mission, degrees, and admittance requirements, separate from those of the main campus. Before merging with GSU, PC served metro Atlanta with five campus locations and offered more than 40 programs of study, including Arts, Music, Theatre, Nursing, Business Administration, Education, Dental Hygiene, Criminal Justice, and Sign Language Interpreting.

== History ==
Perimeter College was founded by the DeKalb County Board of Education as DeKalb College in 1958 and offered its first classes in Clarkston, Georgia, in 1964. Its service area grew as new campuses opened and students came to the college from throughout the metro area. In 1997, DeKalb College was renamed Georgia Perimeter College. It was called Georgia Perimeter College, as a two-year associate degree-granting unit of the University System of Georgia until January 6, 2016.

== Campuses ==

* Three in DeKalb County:
** Clarkston Campus (formerly known as &quot;Central Campus&quot;), in an unincorporated area south of Clarkston, is the original campus.
** Decatur Campus (formerly known as &quot;South Campus&quot;), in an unincorporated area south of Decatur.
** Dunwoody Campus (formerly known as &quot;North Campus&quot;), in Dunwoody Home to an observatory that is available for public use.

== Academics ==
Perimeter College was the largest two-year college and the fourth-largest institution in the University System of Georgia, with about 21,371 students enrolled. PC&#x27;s online program was the largest in the state university system, serving over 9,000 students. Perimeter College transferred almost 3,000 students annually to bachelor&#x27;s degree programs within the University System of Georgia, accounting for one-fifth of transfers within the system. To allow students to transfer to four-year institutions of their choice, Perimeter pioneered a Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) program, signing more than 40 TAG agreements with in-state, out-of-state, public and private four-year colleges and universities.

More than one-third of Perimeter College&#x27;s faculty members earned their doctorate; this statistic did not include numerous part-time instructors. PC had more Governor&#x27;s Teaching Fellows than any other institution in Georgia: 40 since 1996. More than 46 PC faculty members received National Institute for Staff and Organizational Development Teaching Excellence Awards since 2003.

The 3-year graduation rate was 7% before amalgamation with Georgia State University. 

In 2024, Perimeter College at Georgia State University was the winner of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Community College Innovation Challenge.

== Military outreach ==
Perimeter College&#x27;s Military Outreach program served one of the largest military and veteran populations in the State, with over 1,100 military-affiliated students attending PC each semester. Designated year after year as a Military Friendly and Best-For-Vets institution, PC&#x27;s Military Outreach program had been recognized as a model in the State and across the Nation. The Military Outreach Center provided all the services, support and assistance student veterans need to reach their academic goals. PC had Military Outreach Centers located on all five campuses and provide personalized assistance to its many Online student veterans, offering everything from academic and financial aid counseling, to scholarships and emergency grants for military/veteran students and their families.

== Student life ==
Perimeter College&#x27;s Fine Arts program presented plays, art exhibits and musical performances that were open to the public. The 2009–2010 season included more than 100 events. The college was also home to the DeKalb Symphony Orchestra and the Southern Academy for Literary Arts &amp; Scholarly Research, which celebrated literature and scholarship and hosts an assortment of visiting writers who engage students, faculty, and staff. The &quot;Chattahoochee Review&quot; was the nationally recognized literary magazine published by the college. Teresa Weaver of &quot;Atlanta Magazine&quot; described it as a &quot;fine literary journal&quot;. It received attention as a journal of Southern literature, featuring such writers as James Dickey, but expanded its scope to include international works.

In early 2010, Perimeter College opened the Atlanta Center for Civic Engagement &amp; Service Learning on its Clarkston Campus. The center worked to enhance student learning by providing opportunities for students to apply what they learn into the classroom to real-life situations. Through such activities, they worked to enhance the economic, social and cultural vitality of PC&#x27;s communities, while offering students, faculty, educators and community members the training, tools and support they needed to get engaged and make a difference.

<text>Barueri ( or ) is a Brazilian municipality in the State of São Paulo located in the northwestern part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 276,982 (2020 est.) in an area of .

Its boundaries are Santana de Parnaíba to the north, Osasco in the east, Carapicuíba in the Southeast, Jandira to the south and southwest, and Itapevi the west. The city is served by the trains of line 8 of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (literally &quot;São Paulo Metropolitan Railway Company&quot;), (CPTM).

==History==

&quot;Barueri&quot; means &quot;Red flower that amazes&quot; in a Tupi–Guarani language. According to historians, the history of Barueri dates back to November 11, 1560 with the establishment of &quot;Nossa Senhora Da Escada Chapel&quot; by jesuit missionary José de Anchieta and his further settlement. The hamlet grew to the point of the construction, in 1870 of the &quot;Sorocabana Railway&quot; that initiated its duties in 1875 turning Barueri into an important point of connection between São Paulo, Santana de Parnaíba and Pirapora do Bom Jesus.

Still belonging to the city of Santana de Parnaíba, Barueri was established as an independent city on December 24, 1948 due to its growth.
In 1964, the city&#x27;s territory shrank to two thirds of its original size when Carapicuíba emancipated from it.

== Demographics ==
==Economy==
Companies like Azul Brazilian Airlines, Enel, Cielo, Redecard, DASA, Walmart Brasil and others have their headquarters in Barueri.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Sports==
The most notable football (soccer) club in the city is Grêmio Barueri, which plays at Arena Barueri, in 2009 played in the Brazilian top league. In February 2010 the team was moved to Presidente Prudente, a city that is located in western São Paulo (state). After moving to Presidente Prudente the team&#x27;s new home stadium was Estádio Eduardo José Farah, which has a maximum capacity of 44,414 people.

Also in 2010, Campinas Futebol Clube, relocated to Barueri and became Sport Club Barueri. In 2017, Oeste FC also moved to Barueri.

<doc id="998712" wikidata="Q6376216" url="?curid=998712" title="Katharine McCormick">
<text>Katharine Dexter McCormick (August 27, 1875 – December 28, 1967) was a U.S. suffragist, philanthropist and, after her husband&#x27;s death, heir to a substantial part of the McCormick family fortune. She funded most of the research necessary to develop the first birth control pill.

==Early life and education==
Katharine Dexter was born on August 27, 1875, in Dexter, Michigan, in her grandparents&#x27; mansion, Gordon Hall. Her grandfather, the judge Samuel W. Dexter, son of politician Samuel Dexter, had settled and founded the town in 1824. She grew up in Chicago where her father, Wirt Dexter, was a prominent lawyer and philanthropic leader. Following the early death of her father of a heart attack at age 57 when she was 14 years old, she and her mother Josephine moved to Boston in 1890. Four years later, her brother Samuel died of meningitis at age 25.

Dexter passed entrance exams to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1896, but was required to take three years of prerequisite classes to enroll. Arriving in 1899, Katharine graduated from the in 1904, earning a BSc in biology.

==Marriage to Stanley McCormick==
She planned to attend medical school, but instead married Stanley Robert McCormick, the youngest son of Cyrus McCormick and heir to the International Harvester fortune, on September 15, 1904. In September 1905, they moved into a house in Brookline, Massachusetts. The couple did not have any children.

Stanley graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Princeton University in 1895 where he had also been a gifted athlete on the varsity tennis team. He had been showing signs of progressively worsening mental illness. In September 1906, he was hospitalized for over a year at McLean Hospital and was originally diagnosed with dementia praecox, an early label for what is now today known as schizophrenia.

In June 1908, Stanley was moved to the McCormicks&#x27; Riven Rock estate in Montecito, California, where his schizophrenic older sister, Mary Virginia, had lived from 1898 to 1904 before being placed in a Huntsville, Alabama, sanitarium. While there, he was examined by the prominent German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and diagnosed with the catatonic form of dementia praecox. In 1909, Stanley was declared legally incompetent and his guardianship divided between Katharine and the McCormick family.

==Women&#x27;s rights activist==

Katharine&#x27;s plea for gender equality was apparent from early on. As an undergraduate at MIT, she confronted administration officials. MIT required that women wear hats at all times, including while at work. Katharine initially complied, then later refused. She argued that it was a fire hazard for feathered hats to be worn in laboratories. As a result, MIT&#x27;s administration changed their policies.

In 1909 McCormick spoke at the first outdoor rally for woman suffrage in Massachusetts. She became vice president and treasurer of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and funded the association&#x27;s publication the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;.
McCormick organized much of Carrie Chapman Catt&#x27;s efforts to gain ratification for the Nineteenth Amendment. While working with Catt, she met other social activists, including Mary Dennett and Margaret Sanger. Katharine met Sanger in 1917, and later that year joined the Committee of 100, a group of women who practiced promoting the legalization of birth control. During World War I, Katharine also worked as a chairwoman of the association&#x27;s War Service Department. In addition, she was a member of the Women&#x27;s Committee of the Council of National Defense. In 1920, after the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, McCormick became the vice president of the League of Women Voters.

Throughout the 1920s, McCormick worked with Sanger on birth control issues. McCormick smuggled more than 1,000 diaphragms from Europe to New York City to Sanger&#x27;s Clinical Research Bureau. She scheduled meetings with major European diaphragm manufacturers in cities such as Rome and Paris, and used her language skills and biology background to pose as a French or German scientist and place large orders for the devices. They were shipped to her family chateau, Prangins Castle, outside Geneva, where they were sewn into the linings of fashionable coats and other garments. She smuggled them past U.S. customs agents in New York, having successfully disguised them as the spoils of extravagant European shopping sprees for high-end fashions. She made these trips every summer from 1922 to 1925, retiring only after the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake forced her to redirect her attention to rebuilding her husband&#x27;s estate and devote her energy to helping direct his care.

In 1927, McCormick hosted a reception of delegates attending the 1927 World Population Conference at her home in Geneva. In that year McCormick also turned to the science of endocrinology to aid her husband, believing that a defective adrenal gland caused his schizophrenia.

==Philanthropist==

Inspired by her husband&#x27;s diagnosis, Katharine was determined to find a cure. Believing that Stanley&#x27;s illness was a defective adrenal gland, and could be treated with hormone treatment, she established the Neuroendocrine Research Foundation from 1927 to 1947 at Harvard Medical School, and subsidized the publication of the journal &quot;Endocrinology&quot;. Originally called the &quot;Stanley R. McCormick Memorial Foundation for Neuro- Endocrine Research Corporation&quot;, it was the first U.S institute to launch research on the link between endocrinology and mental illness. She also created a research center for the care of the mentally ill at Worcester State Hospital. Her mother Josephine died on November 16, 1937, at age 91 leaving her an estate of more than 10 million dollars. Stanley died on January 19, 1947, at age 72 leaving an estate of over 35 million dollars to Katharine. She spent five years settling his estate, 85% of which went to pay inheritance taxes.

In 1953 McCormick met Gregory Goodwin Pincus through Margaret Sanger. Pincus had been working on developing a hormonal birth control method since 1951 and his own research laboratory, the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. The drug company that supported Pincus stopped funding his pioneering research because he had yet to make a profit. As a result, McCormick started to fund Pincus&#x27;s research foundation. The donations started at $100,000 annually, and later $150,000-$180,000 up until her death in 1967. In sum, McCormick had provided $2 million (around $20 million today) of her own money for the development of the oral contraceptive pill. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of the Pill in 1957 for menstrual disorders and added contraception to its indications in 1960. Even after the pill was approved, she continued to fund Pincus&#x27;s lab and research on ways into improving birth control research through the 1960s.

After the successful development and approval of the contraceptive pill, Katharine yielded her attention to the lack of housing for women at MIT. MIT was always coeducational, but because it could provide housing to only some fifty female students, many of the women who attended MIT had to be local residents. However, the place of women at the Institute was far from secure as Katharine Dexter told Dorothy Weeks (a physicist and mathematician who earned her master&#x27;s and doctorate from MIT) that she had lived &quot;in a cold fear that suddenly—unexpectedly—Tech might exclude women...&quot;.

In order to provide female students a permanent place at MIT, she donated the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all female dormitory that would allow MIT to house 200 female students. Katharine&#x27;s funding made a tremendous impact on the number of women at MIT, increasing the number from 3% to 40%. The ramifications of the hall are best stated by William Hecht &#x27;61, executive vice president of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT when he said, &quot;the visible presence of women at MIT helped open up the science and engineering professions to a large part of the population that before had been excluded. It demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that at MIT men and women are equal.&quot;

McCormick was also an avid supporter of the arts, particularly to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art where she was one of the Museum&#x27;s founding members, vice president and donor of the Stanley McCormick Gallery in 1942. Sharing vice president duties with fellow philanthropist and art collector Wright S. Ludington, McCormick served on the Museum&#x27;s Buildings Committee and was responsible for the hiring of the renowned Chicago architect, David Adler, to convert the old post office into the art museum.

==Death==
She died on December 28, 1967, in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 92. Her will provided $5 million to the Stanford University School of Medicine to support female physicians, $5 million to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which funded the Katharine Dexter McCormick Library in Manhattan, New York City, and $1 million to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. In addition, McCormick made arrangements for $500,000 to be donated to the Art Institute of Chicago and the donation of nine important impressionist paintings to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, which included three major landscapes by Claude Monet. Along with these paintings, McCormick also donated her residence, which is now known as the Ridley-Tree Education Center. It is currently used by the Museum for child and adult art classes.

==Legacy==
Katharine McCormick is a character in T.C. Boyle&#x27;s novel &quot;Riven Rock&quot; (1998), which is mainly about her husband Stanley&#x27;s mental illness.

McCormick was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1998. She was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2000.

There is a dorm named after her husband at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<text>Richard of Chichester (1197 – 3 April 1253), also known as Richard de Wych, is a saint (canonized 1262) who was Bishop of Chichester.

In Chichester Cathedral a shrine dedicated to Richard had become a richly decorated centre of pilgrimage. In 1538, during the reign of Henry VIII, the shrine was plundered and destroyed by order of Thomas Cromwell. Richard of Chichester is the patron saint of Sussex in southern England; since 2007, his translated saint&#x27;s day of 16 June has been celebrated as Sussex Day.

==Life==
Saint Richard was born near Burford, near the town of Wyche (modern Droitwich, Worcestershire) and was an orphan member of a gentry family. On the death of their parents Richard&#x27;s elder brother was heir to the estates but he was not old enough to inherit, so the lands were subject to a feudal wardship. On coming of age his brother took possession of his lands, but was required to pay a medieval form of death duty that left the family so impoverished that Richard had to work for him on the farm. His brother also made Richard heir to the estate. According to Richard&#x27;s biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a &quot;certain noble lady&quot;. However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also reconveyed the estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the Church.

Educated at the University of Oxford, Richard soon began to teach in the university. From there he proceeded to Paris and then Bologna, where he distinguished himself by his proficiency in canon law. On returning to England in 1235, Richard was elected Oxford&#x27;s chancellor.

His former tutor, Edmund of Abingdon, had become archbishop of Canterbury. Richard shared Edmund&#x27;s ideals of clerical reform and supported papal rights even against the king. In 1237, Archbishop Edmund appointed Richard chancellor of the diocese of Canterbury. Richard joined the archbishop during his exile at Pontigny, and was with him when the archbishop died circa 1240. Richard then decided to become a priest and studied theology for two years with the Dominicans at Orléans. Upon returning to England, Richard became the parish priest at Charing and at Deal, but soon was reappointed chancellor of Canterbury by the new archbishop Boniface of Savoy.

In 1244 saint Richard was elected Bishop of Chichester. Henry III and part of the chapter refused to accept him, the king favouring the candidature of Robert Passelewe (d. 1252). Archbishop Boniface refused to confirm Passelew, so both sides appealed to the pope. The king confiscated the see&#x27;s properties and revenues, but Innocent IV confirmed Richard&#x27;s election and consecrated him bishop at Lyons in March 1245. Richard then returned to Chichester, but the king refused to restore the see&#x27;s properties for two years, and then did so only after being threatened with excommunication. Henry III forbade anyone to house or feed Richard. At first, Richard lived at Tarring in the house of his friend Simon, the parish priest of Tarring, visited his entire diocese on foot, and cultivated figs in his spare time.

Richard&#x27;s private life was said to have displayed rigid frugality and temperance. Richard was an ascetic who wore a hair-shirt and refused to eat off silver. He kept his diet simple and rigorously excluded animal flesh; having been a vegetarian since his days at Oxford.

Richard furnished the chronicler, Matthew Paris, with material for the life of St. Edmund Rich, and instituted the offerings for the cathedral at Chichester which were known later as &quot;St. Richard&#x27;s pence&quot;.

Richard was merciless to usurers, corrupt clergy and priests who mumbled the Mass. He was also a stickler for clerical privilege.

Richard&#x27;s episcopate was marked by the favour which he showed to the Dominicans, a house of this order at Orléans having sheltered him during his stay in France, and by his earnestness in preaching a crusade. After dedicating St Edmund&#x27;s Chapel at Dover, he died aged 56 at the Maison Dieu, Dover at midnight on 3 April 1253, where the Pope had ordered him to preach a crusade. His internal organs were removed and placed in that chapel&#x27;s altar. Richard&#x27;s body was then carried to Chichester and buried, according to his wishes, in the chapel on the north side of the nave, dedicated to his patron St. Edmund. His remains were translated to a new shrine in 1276.

==Episcopal statutes==

After the full rights of the see and its revenues were returned to him in 1246, the new bishop showed much eagerness to reform the manners and morals of his clergy, and also to introduce greater order and reverence into the services of the Church.
Richard overruled Henry on several occasions. Richard defrocked a priest who had seduced a nun out of her convent, turning aside a petition from the king in the priest&#x27;s favour.

Richard was militant in protecting the clergy from abuse. When townsmen of Lewes violated the right of sanctuary by seizing a criminal in church and lynching him, Richard made them exhume the body and give it a proper burial in consecrated ground. He also imposed severe penance on knights who attacked priests.

Richard produced a body of statutes with the aid of his chapter, for the organisation of the church in his diocese and the expected conduct of its clergy. It seems that many of the clergy still secretly married, though such alliances were not recognised by canon law, and as such their women&#x27;s status was that of a mistress or concubine. The bishop endeavoured to suppress the practice in his diocese with relentless austerity.

By Richard&#x27;s statutes [the following is a close paraphrase not an exact quote]:

It was decreed that married clergy should be deprived of their benefices; their concubines were to be denied the privileges of the church during their lives and also after death; they were pronounced incapable of inheriting any property from their husbands, and any such bequests would be donated for the upkeep of the cathedral. A vow of chastity was to be required of candidates for ordination. Rectors were expected to reside in their parishes, to be hospitable and charitable. Tithes were to be paid on all annual crops. Anyone who did not pay their tithe would not be granted penance until they did.
Vicars were to be priests and have only one freehold to live on. They were not allowed to have another parish held under an assumed name.
Deacons were not to be allowed to hear confessions or to provide penances, or to baptise except in the absence of a priest. Children had to be confirmed within a year of baptism. The Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer were to be learned in the mother tongue; priests were to celebrate mass in clean robes, to use a silver or golden chalice; thoroughly clean corporals and at least two consecrated palls were to be placed on the altar; the cross was to be planted in front of the celebrant; the bread was to be of the purest wheaten flour, the wine mixed with water. The elements were not to be kept more than seven days; when carried to a sick person to be enclosed in a pyx, and the priest to be preceded by a cross; a candle, holy water and bell.
Practices such as gambling at baptisms and marriages was strictly forbidden.
Archdeacons were to administer justice for their proper fees, not demanding more for either rushing or delaying the business. They were to visit the churches regularly, to see that the services were duly ministered, the vessels and vestments were in proper order, the canon of the mass correctly observed and distinctly read, as also the &quot;hours&quot;. Priests who clipped or slurred the words by rushing were to be suspended.
The clergy should wear their proper dress and not imitate what lay people wore. They were not allowed to wear their hair long or have romantic entanglements. The names of excommunicated persons to be read out four times a year in the parish churches.
A copy of these statutes was to be kept by every priest in the diocese and be brought by him to the episcopal synod.

==Shrine==
It was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard&#x27;s tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262, just 9 years after his death, he was canonized at Viterbo by Pope Urban IV.

Richard&#x27;s feast day is on 3 April in the West, but because this date generally falls within Lent or Eastertide this is normally translated to 16 June in some provinces of the Anglican Communion (the Anglican Church of Canada, for example, commemorates Richard on 3 April), which venerates St. Richard more widely than does the Roman Catholic Church, Richard is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 16 June.

The first Anglican bishop of Chichester was Richard Sampson, during the reign of King Henry VIII of England. Through his Vicar-General, Thomas Cromwell, the king ordered the destruction of Richard&#x27;s shrine in Chichester cathedral in 1538.

Forasmuch as we have lately been informed that in our cathedral church of Chichester there hath been used long heretofore, and yet at this day is used, much superstition and a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine and bones of a certain bishop of the same, whom they call Saint Richard, and a certain resort there of common people, which being men of simplicity are seduced by the instigation of some of the clergy, who take advantage of their credulity to ascribe miracles of healing and other virtues to the said bones, that God only hath authority to grant. . . . . We have appointed you, with all convenient diligence to repair unto the said cathedral church, and to take away the shrine and bones of that bishop called Saint Richard, with all ornaments to the said shrine belonging, and all other the reliques and reliquaries, the silver, the gold, and all the jewels belonging to said shrine, and that not only shall you see them to be safely and surely conveyed unto our Tower of London there to be bestowed and placed at your arrival, but also ye shall see both the place where the shrine was kept, destroyed even to the ground and all such other images of the said church, where about any notable superstition is used, to be carried and conveyed away, so that our subjects shall by them in no ways be deceived hereafter, but that they pay to Almighty God and to no earthly creature such honour as is due unto him the Creator. . . . . Given under our privy seal at our manor of Hampton Court, the 14th day of Dec., in the 30th year of our reign (1538). 

The Shrine of St. Richard had, up to this point, enjoyed a level of popularity approaching that accorded to Thomas Becket at Canterbury. The document ordering the destruction of the shrine was issued to a Sir William Goring of Burton and a William Ernley. They received £40 for carrying out the commission on 20 December 1538.

One of the royal commissioners for the destruction of St. Richard&#x27;s Shrine, William Ernley, was associated with the parish of West Wittering in Sussex. Someone from there, it seems, may have spirited away the relics and bones of St. Richard and hidden them in their own parish church. It is here that local tradition holds remains of the saint are to be found:

The Lady Chapel not only contains the Saxon Cross but also an ancient broken marble slab engraved with a Bishop&#x27;s pastoral staff and a Greek cross believed to have come from a reliquary containing the relics of St. Richard of Chichester, a 13th century bishop who often visited West Wittering. Part of his story is shown in the beautiful red, white and gold altar frontal presented by Yvonne Rusbridge in 1976. On the left St Richard is shown feeding the hungry in Cakeham and on the right leading his followers from the church, his candle miraculously alight despite the gust of wind which blew out all the other candles.
The modern St Richard&#x27;s Shrine is located in the retro-quire of Chichester cathedral and was re-established in 1930 by Dean Duncan Jones. In 1987 during the restoration of the Abbey of La Lucerne, in Normandy, the lower part of a man&#x27;s arm was discovered in a reliquary. The relic was thought to be Richard&#x27;s. After examination, to establish its provenance, the relic was offered to Bishop Eric Kemp and received into the cathedral on 15 June 1990. The relic was buried in 1991 below the St Richard altar. A further relic, together with an authentication certificate, was offered from Rome at the same time and is now housed at the bishop&#x27;s chapel in Chichester. The modern shrine of Richard contains an altar that was designed by Robert Potter, a tapestry designed by Ursula Benker-Schirmer (partly woven in her studio in Bavaria and partly at the West Dean College) and an icon designed by Sergei Fyodorov that shows St Richard in episcopal vestments, his hand raised in blessing towards the viewer, but also in supplication to the figure of Christ who appears to him from heaven .

==Prayer==
Richard is widely remembered today for the popular prayer ascribed to him:

&quot;Thanks be to Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ&quot;
&quot;For all the benefits Thou hast given me,&quot;
&quot;For all the pains and insults Thou hast borne for me.&quot;
&quot;O most merciful Redeemer, friend and brother,&quot;
&quot;May I know Thee more clearly,&quot;
&quot;Love Thee more dearly,&quot;
&quot;Follow Thee more nearly.&quot;
Richard is supposed to have recited the prayer on his deathbed, surrounded by the clergy of the diocese. The words were transcribed, in Latin, by his confessor Ralph Bocking, a Dominican friar, and were eventually published in the &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot;, an encyclopedic text in 68 folio volumes of documents examining the lives of Christian saints. The British Library copy, contains what is believed to be Bocking&#x27;s transcription of the prayer:
&quot;Gratias tibi ago, Domine Jesu Christe, de omnibus beneficiis quae mihi praestitisti;&quot;
&quot;pro poenis et opprobriis, quae pro me pertulisti;&quot;
&quot;propter quae planctus ille lamentabilis vere tibi competebat.&quot;
&quot;Non est dolor similis sicut dolor meus.&quot;


Whoever translated the Latin into English was obviously skilled in his craft as he managed to produce a rhyming triplet, namely &quot;clearly, dearly, nearly&quot;. However, versions of St Richard&#x27;s prayer, before the 20th century, did not contain the triplet and it is thought that the first version that did was published in &quot;The Churchmans Prayer Manual&quot; by G.R.Bullock-Webster in 1913. The first use of the rhyming triplet in a hymn was in the &quot;Mirfield Mission Hymnbook&quot; of 1922, and the first use of the phrase &quot;Day by Day&quot; was in the &quot;Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition&quot; published in 1931.

The author who is credited with translating the prayer from the original &quot;Acta Sanctorum&quot; and bringing it to public notice, was Cecil Headlam in 1898. The following version in the &quot;Prayers of Saints&quot; is quite different from the one that is familiar today :
&quot;THE DYING PRAYER OF S. RICHARD, &quot;

&quot;LORD JESU CHRIST, I thank Thee for &quot;
&quot;all the blessings Thou hast given me, &quot;
&quot;and for all the sufferings and shame Thou &quot;
&quot;didst endure for me, on which account that &quot;
&quot;pitiable cry of sorrow was Thine : &quot; Behold and &quot;
&quot;see, if there was any sorrow like unto My &quot;
&quot;sorrow ! &quot; Thou knowest, Lord, how willing &quot;
&quot;I should be to bear insult, and pain, and death &quot;
&quot;for Thee; therefore have mercy on me, for to &quot;
&quot;Thee do I commend my spirit. Amen&quot;

The prayer was adapted for the song &quot;Day by Day&quot; in the musical &quot;Godspell&quot; (1971), with music by Stephen Schwartz. The words used, with a few embellishments, were based on the following from &quot;Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition&quot;:

&quot;Day by day,&quot;
&quot;Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray:&quot;
&quot;To see thee more clearly,&quot;
&quot;Love thee more dearly,&quot;
&quot;Follow thee more nearly,&quot;
&quot;Day by Day.&quot;

A portion of the prayer has been incorporated into the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church for use by the personal ordinariates established to bring the Anglican patrimony into the Church. Observance of the memorial of Saint Richard of Chichester on 16 June is inscribed in the calendar of Divine Worship: The Missal and the following Collect is provided:

&quot;MOST merciful Redeemer,&quot;
&quot;who gavest to thy Bishop Richard a love of learning,&quot;
&quot;a zeal for souls, and a devotion to the poor:&quot;
&quot;grant that, encouraged by his example,&quot;
&quot;and aided by his prayers,&quot;
&quot;we may know thee more clearly,&quot;
&quot;love thee more dearly,&quot;
&quot;and follow thee more nearly,&quot;
&quot;day by day;&quot;
&quot;who livest and reignest with the Father&quot;
&quot;in the unity of the Holy Spirit, ever one God,&quot;
&quot;world without end. Amen.&quot;

<text>Combretum imberbe (also known as leadwood or mhoba-hoba, , , , ) is a characteristic and often impressive bushwillow species of the southern Afrotropics. The medium to large tree has a sparse, semi-deciduous canopy of grey-green leaves. The twigs and leaves are hairless as the name &quot;imberbe&quot; suggests. Its heartwood is dark brown, close-grained, and very hard and heavy, as suggested by its vernacular name. The durable hardtwood is much sought after in the woodcarving industry. The Hereros and Ovambos of Namibia attach special cultural and religious significance to the tree, as to them it is the great ancestor of all animals and people, which must be passed with respect.

==Range==
It is native to the mesic savannas of Africa south of the equator, from KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, in the south to Tanzania in the north. It is a native tree in South Africa, eSwatini, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia and Tanzania. It is a protected tree in South Africa.

==Description==
The largest bushwillow species of southern Africa has a distinct habit and features. It has a spreading, rather sparse, roundish to slightly umbrella-shaped crown. The smallish, grey-green leaves and small, yellowish-green samaras are carried on spiny, attenuate branchlets.

It typically grows to tall, but may reach . In maturity the single, solid bole may be up in diameter. The distinctive bark is pale to dark grey in colour, deeply fissured lengthwise. Irregular horizontal cracks infuse the bark a fairly regular, coarse-grained appearance.

Radiocarbon dating, done in South Africa, has established that a leadwood tree can live up to 1070 ± 40 years. A tree can remain standing for many years after it has died.

==Uses==
*The wood is dense and very hard, difficult to plane, but drills, sands and turns well. It is termite resistant. It was once used for railway sleepers and is now prized for ornamental work and furniture. 
*It burns very slowly with intense heat, and is often used for a fire which is intended to burn all night in order to keep wild animals at bay. It is sometimes used in a barbecue to provide a hot, long-lasting flame.
*The ashes are used as whitewash for painting walls of kraal huts.
*The ashes can also be used as toothpaste when mixed into a paste with water.

The ashes can also be added in a paste of tamarind, kneaded together to make a sweet smoothie. This is common among the Marembe people in Nyamapanda area.

<text>Zeppet Store (stylized as ZEPPET STORE) is a Japanese alternative rock band, formed in 1989. They became known after hide signed them to his record label LEMONed in 1996. The band disbanded in 2005, before reuniting in 2011.

==History==
Zeppet Store formed in 1989 as a three piece by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Seizi Kimura, lead guitarist Makoto Gomi, and bassist Yuichi Nakamura. Drummer Eiki &quot;Yana&quot; Yanagita joined soon after. In 1996, the band signed to the label LEMONed owned by X Japan guitarist hide and released &quot;716&quot;. The album received an American release and the group went on the USA Tour &#x27;96. Gomi left in 1997 as he did not like being signed to a major label. Guitarist Kenji Akabane did not join until 1998. Zeppet Store disbanded on August 14, 2005.

On June 2, 2007, the band sans Akabane reunited with Gomi for a one-night only performance at the 15th anniversary event of the Under Flower Record label. In 2011, Zeppet Store fully restarted activities, with both Akabane and Gomi, to record a new single with the proceeds going to aid the victims of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The song, called &quot;Smile&quot;, was completed on July 16 and released on iTunes on August 13. While a physical CD single of the song, coupled with the B-side &quot;If You Want Me&quot;, was given a limited release on September 3.

The quintet performed at hide Film Alive ~hide Memorial Day 2012~ on May 2, 2012. They released their tenth studio album &quot;Shape 5&quot; on December 13, hide&#x27;s birthday, and went on the Zeppet Store Tour &quot;Come and Go&quot; in January 2013. Zeppet Store contributed a cover of hide&#x27;s song &quot;Good Bye&quot; to December 2013&#x27;s &quot;Tribute VII -Rock Spirits-&quot;. The band released their eleventh album, &quot;Spice&quot;, on January 15, 2014 and began a live tour in March.

In 2019, Zeppet Store celebrated their 30th anniversary in several ways. Two albums containing new recordings of old songs were released on July 16, 2019.

<doc id="998753" wikidata="Q6111711" url="?curid=998753" title="Jack Clemo">
<text>Reginald John Clemo (11 March 1916 – 25 July 1994) was a Cornish poet and writer who was strongly associated both with his native Cornwall and his strong Christian belief. His work was considered to be visionary and inspired by the rugged Cornish landscape. He was the son of a clay-kiln worker and his mother, Eveline Clemo (née Polmounter, died 1977), was a dogmatic nonconformist.

==Early life==
Clemo was born in the parish of St Stephen-in-Brannel near St Austell. His father was killed at sea towards the end of the First World War and he was raised by his mother, who exerted a dominant influence on him. He was educated at the village school but after age of 13 his formal schooling ceased with the onset of his blindness. He became deaf around age 20, and blind in 1955, about 19 years later. The china clay mines and works around which he grew up were to feature strongly in his work.

==Literary career==
Clemo&#x27;s early work was published in the local press but his literary breakthrough came with the novel &quot;Wilding Graft&quot;, which was published by Chatto and Windus in 1948 winning an Atlantic Award. This was followed in 1949 by his autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Rebel&quot;, which established Clemo as a remarkable and original writer. Clemo developed further as a writer and in 1951 he published his first collection, &quot;The Clay Verge&quot;. Set in a stark landscape, the poems explore the forces of nature and the workings of a hard-won grace. He received national recognition for the first time in the same year during the Festival of Britain where he was awarded a literary prize.

In 1970 he was appointed a Bard of the Gorseth Kernow and conferred with the title &quot;Poet of the Clay&quot;. In 1981, at the age of 65, he received an honorary literary doctorate from the University of Exeter.

==Marriage==

Clemo was deeply religious and believed it was God&#x27;s will for him to marry. However it was not until he reached his early 50s when he met and subsequently married Ruth Peaty in 1968, who came from Weymouth. Following his marriage in 1968 he was able to discover a lighter side to life and poetry. His love for Ruth, both expressed through his poetry and his mischievous wit, are encapsulated in the little romantic cards he composed each year for her.

==Public recognition==
By the age of 65 he had achieved sufficient recognition for a dramatised version of his biography, directed by Norman Stone, to be produced and screened by the BBC in 1980. A few years later, a book about the role of providence in the marriage of Jack Clemo was written by Sally Magnusson. He was also photographed by Tricia Porter in 1975, and the images are held at the National Portrait Gallery in London.

The first major academic conference on Clemo, &quot;Kindling the Scarp&quot;, was held at Wheal Martyn, Cornwall, on 31 May and 1 June 2013, organised by scholars at the University of Warwick and the University of Exeter. This coincided with the closure of Trethosa Chapel on Sunday 2 June and the relocation of their Clemo Memorial Room artefacts to Wheal Martyn Museum and Park in St Austell.

==Italian sojourn==
An unexpected change to his writing subsequently occurred after two trips to Italy late in his life. In 1987 he first visited Venice and then, six years later, he also travelled to Florence. This seemed to prompt a blaze of much more colourful verse, integrating the personal drama of his own life with the sweep of Italian faith, culture, landscape and history. In &quot;Heretic in Florence&quot; he recounted the stench of the dry river Arno and its cure, portraying it as a metaphor for his own release from merely barren art.

==Death and legacy==
Clemo died, aged 78, in Weymouth on 25 July 1994.

His personal and literary papers, including diaries, correspondence, and manuscripts of prose and poetry works, are held by the University of Exeter.

An annual Jack Clemo Poetry Competition was established in 1995 by the Arts Centre Group (ACG) having received a legacy from Jack Clemo&#x27;s estate. The first winner was Ulster English teacher and poet Ray Givans and the prize was £30 and a sculpture by ACG member Iain Cotton in Cornish stone with a Celtic design (the sculpture to be held for one year). The winning poem was entitled &quot;Work Ethic&quot;.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in Jack Clemo, led by writer and editor Luke Thompson. This has led to the publication of a new &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (Enitharmon, 2015), a complete collection of dialect tales &quot;A Proper Mizz-Maze&quot; (Francis Boutle, 2016), a pamphlet short story &quot;The Clay Dump&quot; (Guillemot Press, 2016), an album of Clemo&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Clay Hymnal&quot;, set to music by folk musician Jim Causley, and the first full biography of Jack Clemo, written by Luke Thompson and entitled &quot;Clay Phoenix&quot; (Ally Press, 2016).

==Posthumous controversy==
The former Cornish home of Jack Clemo was demolished by the Goonvean China Clay Company on 6 September 2005 to make way for new laboratories. This provoked much anger both locally and from fans of the poet, who had lived most of his life at the cottage, except for his last 10 years after having moved to Weymouth in 1984.

Dr Philip Payton, director of the Institute of Cornish Studies in Truro, said he would like to see the cottage as a museum. &quot;You cannot think about Jack Clemo without thinking about the china clay country. And you cannot think about the china clay country in any serious sense without pondering about Jack Clemo. To obliterate the cottage would be to erase [Clemo] from the landscape of Cornwall. He is hugely important in a Cornish context and also as an international poet. He is one of the greats. There is something about Jack Clemo&#x27;s cottage that says so much about him as a person. It is so humble and in such a bleak place and it speaks volumes about his disabilities and achievements.&quot;

Alan Sanders, secretary of the Jack Clemo Memorial Room at Trethosa Chapel, said: &quot;On a personal and literary level this cottage was highly important. I have known this cottage all my life so I am deeply saddened. A lot of people are still keen on Jack&#x27;s work and will be very disappointed.&quot; Mr Sanders said the company had ignored requests to keep the cottage although he accepted it was within its rights and had broken no planning rules in demolishing the cottage. A scale model of the cottage has subsequently been created and can be seen in Wheal Martyn Museum.

<text>John de Balliol (before 1208 – 25 October 1268) was an English nobleman, belonging to the House of Balliol. Balliol College, in Oxford, is named after him.

==Life==
John de Balliol was born before 1208 to Cecily de Fontaines, daughter of Aléaume de Fontaines, chevalier, seigneur of Fontaines and Longpré-les-Corps-Saints and Hugh de Balliol, Lord of Balliol and of Barnard Castle and Gainford ( 1177 – 2 February 1229). It is believed that he was educated at Durham School in the city of Durham.

In 1223, Lord John married Dervorguilla of Galloway, the daughter of Alan, Lord of Galloway and Margaret of Huntingdon. By the mid-thirteenth century, his wife had become very wealthy, principally as a result of inheritances from her family. This wealth allowed Balliol to play a prominent public role, and, on King Henry III&#x27;s instruction, he served as joint protector of the young king of Scots, Alexander III. He was one of Henry III&#x27;s leading counsellors between 1258 and 1265. and was appointed Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1261 to 1262. He was captured at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, but escaped and rejoined King Henry.
In 1265 Thomas de Musgrave owed him a debt of 123 marks. About 1266, Baldwin Wake owed him a debt of 100 marks and more.

Following a dispute with the Bishop of Durham, he agreed to provide funds for scholars studying at Oxford. Support for a house of students began in around 1263; further endowments, made after his death by Dervorguilla, resulted in the establishment of Balliol College.

==Issue==
John and Dervorguilla had issue:

* Sir Hugh de Balliol, who died without issue before 10 April 1271. He married Agnes de Valence, daughter of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke.
* Alan de Balliol, who died before 10 April 1271 without issue
* Sir Alexander de Balliol, who died without issue before 13 November 1278. He married Eleanor de Genoure.
* King John I of Scotland, successful competitor for the Crown in 1292
* Ada de Balliol, who married, in 1266, William Lindsay of Lamberton, and had a daughter, Christian de Lindsay, who married Enguerrand V de Coucy. Christian and her husband are the ancestors of Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. 
* William de Balliol &quot;le Scot&quot;, who issued John &quot;le Scot&quot;, ancestor of Scotts of Scot&#x27;s Hall and Brabourne. Some sources claim William was a distant cousin, not a son.
* Margaret de Balliol, who may have married Thomas de Moulton. 
* Cecily de Balliol (d. before 1273), who married Sir John de Burgh (d. before 3 March 1280) of Wakerley, Northamptonshire, by whom she had three daughters: Devorguille de Burgh (c. 1256 – 1284), who in 1259 married Robert FitzWalter, 1st Baron FitzWalter; Hawise de Burgh (d. before 24 March 1299), who married Sir Robert de Grelle (or Grelley) (d. 15 February 1282) of Manchester; and Margery de Burgh, who became a nun.
* Mary (or Eleanor) de Balliol, who married John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, and had a son, John &#x27;The Red&#x27; Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (d. 1306).
* Maud (or Matilda) de Balliol, married to Bryan FitzAlan, Lord FitzAlan, and feudal Baron of Bedale. They were parents to Agnes FitzAlan (b. 1298), who married Sir Gilbert Stapleton, Knt., of Bedale (1291–1324). Gilbert is better known for his participation in the assassination of Piers Gaveston, Earl of Cornwall.

<text>Bauru () is a Brazilian municipality in midwestern region of the state of São Paulo. It is the main city of the mesoregion and microregion of Bauru. The population is 379,297 (2020 est.) in an area of 667.68 km2. Established in 1896, its boundaries are Reginópolis to the north, Arealva to the northeast, Pederneiras to the east, Agudos and Piratininga to the south and Avaí to the west.

The presence of a strong service sector, many college campuses - including the University of São Paulo and Universidade Estadual Paulista - and the city&#x27;s location at the junction of three railroads and three highways make Bauru a major urban center of the State of São Paulo.

It is the hometown of Marcos César Pontes, the first Brazilian in space. It is also the town where Pelé grew up and learned his football skills.

The city is served by two airports: the older Comte. João Ribeiro de Barros Airport and the newer Bauru-Arealva Airport, officially known as Moussa Nakhl Tobias Airport, located in the adjoining municipality of Arealva.

==Origin of the name==
There are various theories intended to explain the origin of the name Bauru. One was proposed by Ismael Marinho Falcão, an engineer who lived for many years with the Kaingang tribe, which used to inhabit the region. According to him, the region was called &quot;ubaurú&quot; because of the abundance of a herbaceous plant called &quot;ubá&quot;, used for hampers and wicker baskets, and &quot;urú&quot;, a ground bird related to the chicken.

Others think that the name comes from &quot;mbai-yuru&quot;, meaning &#x27;waterfall&#x27; or &#x27;river in strong declivity&#x27;; or &quot;ybá&quot; or &quot;uru&quot;, &#x27;basket of fruits&#x27; in Old Tupi; or even &quot;bauruz&quot;, as the natives who inhabited the edges of the Batalha River were called.

==History==
Historically, the region occupied by Bauru was a disputed territory between two Indigenous groups: the Kaingang and the Guaraní. In the eighteenth century, ethnic Brazilian pioneers attempted to settle in São Paulo region, which was a crossing point of the &quot;monções&quot; (river expeditions) that went through Mato Grosso and Goiás, but they were prevented by local natives&#x27; attacks.
The non-Indians only managed to settle in the region in the nineteenth century with the coming of the population coming from São Paulo&#x27;s coast as well the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. After 1850, in search of new land for occupation and colonization, pioneers from São Paulo and Minas Gerais began to explore the vast region between the Serra de Botucatu, Tietê River, Paranapanema River and Paraná River, until then inhabited by Kaingang indigenous groups.

In 1856, Felicissimo Antonio Pereira, coming from Minas Gerais, purchased land and settled, near the current center of Bauru, the Fazenda das Flores (&quot;Farm of Flowers&quot;). Years later, in 1884, this farm (also called Campos Novos de Bauru) have spun off part of its area for the training camp of the São Sebastião de Bauru. The district has progressed, even being subject to attacks of native Kaingang and relatively isolated from the rest of the state and became district of Agudos on 1888. The arrival of migrants from eastern São Paulo and Minas Gerais led to the emancipation of the city on August 1, 1896.

The new municipality at first lived from the cultivation of coffee, despite having weaker and infertile lands than the rest of the state. In 1905, Bauru was chosen as the starting point of the Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, which linked by rail, Bauru to Corumbá, Mato Grosso do Sul, near the border with Bolivia. During the first half of the twentieth century, Bauru becomes the main economic hub of the region comprised by west São Paulo, northern Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul.

== Geography ==
The area of the municipality, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, is 667.684 km². It is located at 22º18′54” south latitude and 49º03′39” west longitude and is 326 kilometers northwest of the capital of São Paulo. It borders: Reginópolis (to the north); Arealva (to the northeast); Pederneiras (to the east); Piratininga (to the south); Agudos (southeast); and Avaí (west).

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Climate==

==Sports==
The municipality is home to the professional association football team Esporte Clube Noroeste and Associação Bauru Basketball Team, 2014 Champion of the Liga Sudamericana de Básquetbol and 2015 Champion of the FIBA Americas League. The team plays its home games at the &quot;Ginásio Panela de Pressão&quot;. Brazilian legend Pelé grew up here.

<doc id="998763" wikidata="Q407789" url="?curid=998763" title="Air Southwest">
<text>Air Southwest was a British airline founded by Sutton Harbour Holdings in 2003. Ownership was transferred to Eastern Airways in September 2010 but operations ceased 12 months later. It operated regional scheduled passenger services in South West England. Its main base was Plymouth City Airport, with hubs at Newquay Cornwall Airport and Bristol Airport. The airline employed 145 people and was headed by managing director Peter Davies and Deputy chief executive Mike Coombes.

The company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

==History==

=== Launch ===
Air Southwest was established in May 2003 by Sutton Harbour Holdings to fill the void left by the withdrawal of British Airways from South West England. Its first hub was set up at Plymouth City Airport and operations began on 26 October 2003, the day after British Airways withdrew from the market. The initial route was Plymouth-Newquay-London Gatwick. This was soon followed by the introduction of the Plymouth-Bristol-Manchester route which was later extended to Jersey.

===Expansion===
On 11 April 2005, the company established a new hub at Newquay, with direct flights to Dublin and flights to Leeds-Bradford via Bristol. At the same time, the airline added a crew base at Newquay, with five cabin crew, ten pilots, and one aircraft.

In April 2006, Air Southwest launched services from Newquay to Manchester via Cardiff, and from Bristol to Norwich (although the airline withdrew from this route in January 2007); in addition a crew and aircraft base was established at Bristol. On 30 October 2006 the airline introduced a fifth daily flight from Newquay to London.

The airline used the low fares, web-based format for bookings with over 90% of all bookings made online. In its first eighteen months of operations Air Southwest carried over 200,000 passengers, increasing the number of passengers flying between Plymouth and Newquay and London Gatwick by 22%. On 25 October 2006, the airline announced that it had carried 750,000 passengers since its launch.

The Bristol to Norwich service ended on 14 January 2007, the airline&#x27;s first route discontinuation since inception in 2003. Further consolidation was made with the discontinuation of the direct Newquay to Leeds-Bradford service which was routed via Bristol Airport from 16 January 2007, and an increased frequency on the Plymouth to Manchester service to twice daily, via Bristol, from 15 January 2007.

On 24 June 2007 Air Southwest operated its last flights from Cardiff to Newquay and Manchester due to low passenger numbers.

On 29 October 2007 the airline announced an expansion of routes from Plymouth and Newquay, adding flights from Plymouth to Grenoble, Cork, Dublin, Glasgow and Newcastle, and from Newquay to Grenoble, Glasgow and Newcastle. These new routes commenced on 28 April 2008 with the exception of Grenoble which followed on 20 December 2008.

During the summer of 2009 Air Southwest operated a charter on behalf of C.I. Travel. The operation saw the introduction of commercial flights between Oxford and Jersey every Saturday.

On 2 February 2009 the airline announced an expansion of its services between Plymouth and the Channel Islands with the introduction of a service to Guernsey which started on 8 April 2009.

Consolidation of their services to London came when, on 9 March 2009, Air Southwest announced the launch of flights between Plymouth, Newquay and London City Airport. The flights started on 20 April, but the service failed to attract enough passengers and ceased in May 2010

In May 2009 the airline underwent a rebrand to broaden their target audience and increase their market presence. A new slogan of &quot;Fly Britain&#x27;s Local Airline&quot; was adopted and supported by a television commercial on regional channels, a revamped website and a nationwide advertising campaign.

Another improvement to the services offered came into effect on 31 May 2009 when the airline adopted the IATA code SZ. This has created a number of opportunities for future development such as the introduction of interline agreements/codeshare with other airlines and the possibility of using third parties such as travel agents for ticket sales.

The airline announced the suspension of services from Newquay and Plymouth to London Gatwick from 1 February 2011.

===Strategic alliance with &quot;Eastern Airways&quot;===
An alliance with UK regional carrier Eastern Airways was announced on 25 February 2010. As a result of the alliance Air Southwest joined a Global Distribution System (GDS) enabled them to sell tickets through a number of external sources like travel agents and increase their market presence. It also paved the way for the introduction of codeshare agreements between the two airlines.

===Sale===
In May 2010, Sutton Harbour Holdings, the parent company of Air Southwest, announced that the airline was to be sold to enable the company to &quot;resource activities more effectively&quot;. Following a drop in profits by £600,000, the airline was sold to Humberside Airport-based Eastern Airways in September 2010. On 1 December 2010, the sale was completed to Eastern Airways.

===Closure===
Air Southwest announced on 14 July 2011 that they would cease operations on 30 September 2011. Air Southwest ceased operations at Plymouth on 28 July 2011. Flights to Glasgow, Guernsey, Jersey and Manchester ended on 14 September whilst the remaining flights to Aberdeen, Bristol, Cork, Dublin and Leeds Bradford ended on 30 September. The airline said the closure was due to low demand on routes making them financially unviable. The leases of Air Southwest&#x27;s three remaining aircraft were transferred to Eastern Airways on 4 July 2011. This caused Plymouth Airport to close on 23 December 2011.

==Service==

Originally, Air Southwest operated a buy-on-board service, which provided passengers with a variety of snacks and drinks available for purchase.

On 10 March 2010 however, they started offering complimentary refreshments on all flights. On morning departures, passengers had a choice of a sweet or savoury snack along with a hot or cold beverage, and a complimentary bar service was offered on departures after 1pm. Other product enhancements included the introduction of a hot towel service, along with a boiled sweet pre-departure.

Passengers were given allocated seating when they checked in. A 20-minute minimum check-in time was introduced for all passengers travelling from Plymouth and Newquay with hand luggage only.

The airline offered a premium service called &quot;Advantage&quot;. This service offered the following benefits:
*Free changes to booking up to two hours before flight departure
*Business lounge access
*Provided lotion (for women and men)
*Fast track security
*Free on-board refreshments
*Increased baggage allowance of 30 kg

==Destinations==
Air Southwest served the following destinations throughout its operations:

==Fleet==
Before being transferred to Eastern Airways on 4 July 2011, the Air Southwest fleet included the following aircraft (at 3 July 2011)

As of April 2010, the average age of the Air Southwest fleet was 19.3 years.

==In popular culture==
An Air Southwest Bombardier Dash 8-311 was featured in season 1 episode 1 of British comedy show &quot;Doc Martin&quot;.

<text>Bertioga is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo and part of the Baixada Santista Metropolitan Region. Its population is 64,723 (2020 est.) in an area of 490.15 km2. Because it neighbors resort towns, its population fluctuates greatly with the seasons. The more northern parts are densely forested and humanly unpopulated. It was created on 19 May 1991, from a part of Santos.

The municipality contains the Restinga de Bertioga State Park, created in 2010 to protect an area of mangroves, restinga and rainforest. Its limits are Mogi das Cruzes, Biritiba-Mirim and Salesópolis in the north, São Sebastião in the east, Atlantic Ocean to the south with Ilha de Santo Amaro (opposite the city) and Santos in the west.

Bertioga is where Josef Mengele, a Nazi Germany doctor at Auschwitz, drowned in 1979.

==Media==
Bertioga was served telecommunications by the Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when the Telecomunicações de São Paulo took over. In July 1998, it was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. It now sells and operates cell phones, fixed lines, internet access (fiber optic and 4G) and television reception (satellite and cable).

<doc id="998775" wikidata="Q15077481" url="?curid=998775" title="Gamla Ullevi (1916)">
<text>Gamla Ullevi (, &quot;Old Ullevi&quot;) was a football stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden. Named Ullevi until 1958 when Nya (&quot;New&quot;) Ullevi opened, it was built in 1915–1916 and opened on 17 September 1916 with the game between IFK Göteborg-AB København (2–2). It had a capacity of 15,000 to 18,000, depending on usage.

The record attendance is 32,357 and was set 2 May 1957, when Örgryte IS played IF Elfsborg. IF Elfsborg won 2–1.

Demolition of Gamla Ullevi began on 9 January 2007 at 11.15 AM local time. The stadium has been replaced with a new football stadium. The new stadium, opened on 5 April 2009, has been named Gamla Ullevi as well.

== Name ==
Gamla Ullevi was named after the Nordic god Ull. He was a skier and archer who chased away the winter so he could wake up the goddess of the earth. The word &quot;vi&quot; means holy place. When Gamla Ullevi first opened it was called Ullervi, but after being pressured by a professor of Nordic languages, Hjalmar Lindroth, the &quot;r&quot; was removed. It was only added in the first place to make the name easier to pronounce. (Johansson &amp; Nilsson 1992, p. 4)

== History ==
Before Ullevi, the location was called &quot;Idrottsplatsen&quot;. It was a velocipede arena with room for 600 spectators. Eventually other sports began to use the facilities and a tenniscourt was built in 1901. Other courts were added too, but a new football stadium was needed with a proper grass pitch because of the growing interest in football. &quot;Göteborgs idrottsförbund&quot; created a corporation that had a capital of 90 000kr to spend on a new arena. The end cost of Gamla Ullevi was 160 000kr. It was designed as a stadium for only football despite half-promises being made to the archers and equestrians about space. At that time, the finished arena could hold 12 000 spectators. (Johansson &amp; Nilsson 1992, p. 6–7)

Ullevi became more than just an arena for football though. Next to the football pitch, the ice-skating rink was built and opened 6 January 1917 with a bandy match. Ice hockey and figure skating were two sports that also used the facilities, as well as boxing, fencing, handball, and tennis. (Johansson &amp; Nilsson 1992)

In 1924, Gothenburg city became the owners of Gamla Ullevi. They closed it in 1934 for renovations where they added more seats for spectators, and reopened in 1935. (Öhnander 2002, p. 10) The opening match was between Örgryte IS and AIK (3–1). (Johansson &amp; Nilsson 1992, p. 48)

After Nya Ullevi was opened, it became the home arena to the three football clubs (&quot;GAIS&quot;, &quot;IFK&quot; and &quot;ÖIS&quot;) but they moved back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. (Öhnander 2002, p. 7)

===Gottepojkarna===
Giovanni Galligani was the leader of Gottepojkarna, the snack and drink providers during the match. They sold chocolate, bananas, biscuits and &quot;Ullevikolan&quot; (the Ullevi toffee). There was a main kiosk where all the snacks could be bought, but during the match Gottepojkarna walked around with metal boxes with each type of snack in a separate compartment. These boys had been trained so that when a spectator ordered something they could throw the snack to the customer. The change was also thrown back up and they always hit the right target. (Johansson &amp; Nilsson 1992, p. 20)

===Ullevi-Bladet===
&quot;Ullevi-Bladet&quot; was the name of the match-program that could be bought. It cost 25 öre and was published by &quot;Idrottsjournalisternas Klubb&quot; (&quot;The Sport Journalists Club&quot;) but financed by advertisements. The magazine featured an introduction to the match, the line-up of both teams and the points-chart of Allsvenskan. (Öhnander 2002, p. 27)

<text>The Shroud of Turin (), also known as the Holy Shroud (), is a length of linen cloth that bears a faint image of the front and back of a naked man. Because details of the image are consistent with traditional depictions of Jesus of Nazareth after his death by crucifixion, the shroud has been venerated for centuries, especially by members of the Catholic Church, as Jesus&#x27;s actual burial shroud upon which his image was miraculously imprinted. The human image on the shroud can be discerned more clearly in a black and white photographic negative than in its natural sepia color, an effect discovered in 1898 by Secondo Pia, who produced the first photographs of the shroud. This negative image is associated with a popular Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus.

The documented history of the shroud dates back to 1354, when it began to be exhibited in the new collegiate church of Lirey, a village in north-central France. The shroud was denounced as a forgery by the bishop of Troyes, Pierre d’Arcis, in 1389. It was acquired by the House of Savoy in 1453 and later deposited in a chapel in Chambéry, where it was damaged by fire in 1532. In 1578, the Savoys moved the shroud to their new capital in Turin, where it has remained ever since. Since 1683, it has been kept in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, which was designed for that purpose by architect Guarino Guarini and which is connected to both the royal palace and the Turin Cathedral. Ownership of the shroud passed from the House of Savoy to the Catholic Church after the death of former king Umberto II in 1983.

The microscopist Walter McCrone found, based on his examination of samples taken in 1978 from the surface of the shroud using adhesive tape, that the image on the shroud had been painted with a dilute solution of red ochre pigment in a gelatin medium. McCrone found that the apparent bloodstains were painted with vermilion pigment, also in a gelatin medium. McCrone&#x27;s findings were disputed by other researchers and the nature of the image on the shroud continues to be debated. In 1988, radiocarbon dating by three independent laboratories established that the shroud dates back to the Middle Ages, between the years 1260 and 1390. 

The nature and history of the shroud have been the subjects of extensive and long-lasting controversies in both the scholarly literature and the popular press. Though accepted as valid by experts, the radiocarbon dating of the shroud continues to generate significant public debate. Defenders of the authenticity of the shroud have questioned the radiocarbon results, usually on the basis that the samples tested might have been contaminated or taken from a repair to the original fabric. Such fringe theories, which have been rejected by most experts, include the medieval repair theory, the bio-contamination theories, and the carbon monoxide theory. Currently, the Catholic Church neither endorses nor rejects the authenticity of the shroud as a relic of Jesus.


==Description==

The shroud is rectangular, measuring approximately . The cloth is woven in a three-to-one herringbone twill composed of flax fibrils. Its most distinctive characteristic is the faint, brownish image of a front and back view of a naked man with his hands folded across his groin. The two views are aligned along the midplane of the body and point in opposite directions. The front and back views of the head nearly meet at the middle of the cloth.

The image in faint straw-yellow colour on the crown of the cloth fibres appears to be of a man with a beard, moustache, and shoulder-length hair parted in the middle. He is muscular and tall (various experts have measured him as from ). Reddish-brown stains are found on the cloth, correlating with the wounds in the Biblical description of the crucifixion of Jesus.

The shroud was damaged in a fire in 1532 in the chapel in Chambéry, France. There are some burn holes and scorched areas down both sides of the linen, caused by contact with molten silver during the fire that burned through it in places while it was folded. Fourteen large triangular patches and eight smaller ones were sewn onto the cloth by Poor Clare nuns to repair the damage.

In May 1898, Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898. In 1931, another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia&#x27;s. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the shroud.

==History==

There are no definite historical records concerning the particular shroud currently at Turin Cathedral prior to the 14th century. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus&#x27;s burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century, there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently in Turin.

In 1353 the village of Lirey, in north-central France, was enriched with a small collegiate church endowed by the local feudal lord, a knight named Geoffroi de Charny. Geoffroi died in 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers. Around 1355, the dean of the chapter of Lirey, Robert de Caillac, began exhibiting in the church a long fabric that bore an image of the mangled body of Jesus. In 1390, the Bishop of Troyes, Pierre d&#x27;Arcis, who had jurisdiction over the church in Lirey, wrote a lengthy memorandum to Antipope Clement VII (recognized as Pope by the Church in France during the Western Schism), declaring that the Shroud was a forgery and that a previous Bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, had identified the artist who had made it. Clement issued a bull allowing the canons of Lirey to continue exhibiting the Shroud as long as they made it clear that it was an artistic representation of the passion of Jesus and not a true relic.

In 1415, during the last phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the Shroud was removed from the church of Lirey with the intention of depositing it temporarily at the castle of Montfort for safekeeping. Marguerite de Charny, the granddaughter of the knight who had endowed the church of Lirey, then took possession of the cloth and exhibited it at the church of Saint-Hippolyte, Doubs. Marguerite&#x27;s refusal to return the Shroud to Lirey led to litigation. She carried the Shroud in traveling exhibitions, including to Chimay and Mons. In 1453, Marguerite deeded the Shroud to Louis, Duke of Savoy. For having sold the Shroud and disregarded the rights of the canons of Lirey, Marguerite was excommunicated by the curia of Besançon in 1457.

The Shroud became the palladium of the House of Savoy, and by 1466 it had been deposited in the ducal chapel in Chambéry, the capital of the Savoyard state. In 1506, Pope Julius II authorized the veneration of the Shroud as a true relic of Jesus. In 1532, the Shroud was damaged by a fire in the chapel of Chambéry, when molten silver from the reliquary passed through the layers of folded cloth, leaving a symmetrical pattern of holes in the unfolded Shroud but without doing much damage to the image areas. The Poor Clare nuns in Chambéry later sewed patches over those holes. In 1578, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy ordered the cloth to be brought to Turin, the new Savoyard capital, and it has remained in Turin ever since.

Since the late 17th century, the Shroud has been displayed in the chapel designed for that purpose by architect Guarino Guarini and attached to both the cathedral and the Royal Palace of Turin. Repairs were made to the Shroud in 1694 by Sebastian Valfrè, improving upon the earlier patching by the Poor Clares. Further repairs were made in 1868 by Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. The Shroud was first photographed in 1898, during a public exhibition. The Shroud remained the property of the House of Savoy until 1983, when it was bequeathed to the Holy See according to the terms of the will of former king Umberto II of Italy.

A fire, possibly caused by arson, threatened the Shroud on 11 April 1997. In 2002, the Holy See had the Shroud restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed, making it possible to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view. A faint part-image of the body was found on the back of the Shroud in 2004. The Shroud was placed back on public display (the 18th time in its history) in Turin from 10 April to 23 May 2010; and according to Church officials, more than 2 million visitors came to see it.

On Holy Saturday (30 March) 2013, images of the Shroud were streamed on various websites as well as on television for the first time in 40 years. Roberto Gottardo of the diocese of Turin stated that for the first time they had released high definition images of the Shroud that can be used on tablet computers and can be magnified to show details not visible to the naked eye. As this rare exposition took place, Pope Francis issued a carefully worded statement which urged the faithful to contemplate the Shroud with awe but, like most of his predecessors, he &quot;stopped firmly short of asserting its authenticity&quot;.

The Shroud was again placed on display in the cathedral in Turin from 19 April 2015 until 24 June 2015. There was no charge to view it, but an appointment was required.

==Conservation==
The shroud has undergone several restorations and several steps have been taken to preserve it to avoid further damage and contamination. It is kept under laminated bulletproof glass in an airtight case. The temperature- and humidity-controlled case is filled with argon (99.5%) and oxygen (0.5%) to prevent chemical changes. The shroud itself is kept on an aluminum support sliding on runners and stored flat within the case.

==Religious views==

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke state that Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus in a linen shroud &quot;sindon&quot; and placed it in a new tomb. The Gospel of John says he used linen cloths &quot;othonia&quot;.

After the resurrection, the Gospel of John states: &quot;Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths [othonia] lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus&#x27; head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.&quot;
The Gospel of Luke states: &quot;Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the linen cloths [othonia] lying by themselves.&quot;

In 1543, John Calvin, in his book &quot;Treatise on Relics&quot;, explained why the Shroud cannot be genuine:

Although pieces said to be of burial cloths of Jesus are held by at least four churches in France and three in Italy, none has gathered as much religious following as the Shroud of Turin. The religious beliefs and practices associated with the shroud predate historical and scientific discussions and have continued in the 21st century, although the Catholic Church has never passed judgment on its authenticity. An example is the Holy Face Medal bearing the image from the shroud, worn by some Catholics. Indeed, the Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. Several Lutheran parishes have hosted replicas of the Shroud of Turin, for didactic and devotional purposes.

===Miraculous images===

The concept of &quot;acheiropoieta&quot; (, ; &quot;acheiropoieton&quot;) has a long history in Christianity, going back at least to the 6th century. These are images believed to have been miraculously produced, without the agency of any human artist. Among the most prominent &quot;acheiropoieta&quot; are the Image of Camuliana and the Image of Edessa (also called the &quot;Mandylion&quot;). Both of these were icons of Jesus reported to have existed in the Byzantine Empire, but which are now generally regarded as having been lost or destroyed. Other popular Byzantine &quot;acheiropoieta&quot; were Hodegetria images of the Virgin Mary.

Some images currently held in Italy and other Western European countries, including the Manoppello Image, have been revered as &quot;acheiropoieta&quot; of Jesus. These are usually associated with the tradition of the Veil of Veronica, according to which the image of Jesus&#x27;s face was miraculously imprinted on the cloth that Saint Veronica used to wipe the blood and sweat from the face of Jesus when she comforted him on the &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot;. Although some of these images were once objects of major popular devotions among Catholics, today they have been overshadowed by the fame and prestige of the Shroud of Turin. Another popular relic of Jesus is the Sudarium of Oviedo, which is kept in the &quot;Cámara Santa&quot; of the Cathedral of San Salvador, in Oviedo, Spain. This is not an &quot;acheiropoieton&quot;, but rather a simple bloodstained cloth purported to have been wrapped around the head of Jesus after his death.

===Devotions===
Today the Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus are usually associated with the negative image of the Shroud of Turin, as first captured in Secondo Pia&#x27;s 1898 photograph. However, these devotions predate Pia&#x27;s image, having been established in 1844 by the Carmelite nun Marie of St Peter, based on depictions of Jesus before his crucifixion and associated with the tradition of the Veil of Veronica. This devotion was then promoted by a French Catholic layman, Leo Dupont, who became known as the &quot;Apostle of the Holy Face&quot;. In 1851 Dupont formed the &quot;Archconfraternity of the Holy Face&quot; in the city of Tours. Pope Leo XIII approved the devotion to the Holy Face in 1885. The popular French Saint Thérèse of Lisieux took the name &quot;Thérèse of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face&quot; when she became a Discalced Carmelite in 1889. Saint Thérèse, who died in 1897, also helped to spread the devotion to the Holy Face before it became associated with Pia&#x27;s photographic image of the Shroud of Turin.

The modern devotion to the Holy Face centered on the negative photographic image from the Shroud of Turin derives principally from an Italian nun born in Milan, Maria Pierina De Micheli, who reported having visions of Jesus starting in 1936. Sister Maria Pierina designed a &quot;Holy Face Medal&quot;, based on Second Pia&#x27;s photographs. This medal was eventually approved for private devotion by Pope Pius XII.

===Vatican position===
In 1389, the bishop of Troyes sent a memorial to Antipope Clement VII, declaring that the cloth had been &quot;artificially painted in an ingenious way&quot; and that &quot;it was also proved by the artist who had painted it that it was made by human work, not miraculously produced&quot;. In 1390, Clement VII consequently issued four papal bulls, with which he allowed the exposition, but ordered to &quot;say aloud, to put an end to all fraud, that the aforementioned representation is not the true Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, but a painting or panel made to represent or imitate the Shroud&quot;. However, in 1506, Pope Julius II reversed this position and declared the Shroud to be authentic and authorized the public veneration of it with its own mass and office.

The Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; covered the story of Secondo Pia&#x27;s photograph of 28 May 1898 in its edition of 15 June 1898, but it did so with no comment and thereafter Church officials generally refrained from officially commenting on the photograph for almost half a century.

The first official modern association between the Shroud and the official Catholic Church dates from 1940, when Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli approached the curia of Milan requesting authorization to produce a devotional medal based on the image of Jesus&#x27;s face from the Shroud. This &quot;Holy Face Medal&quot; was approved by Pope Pius XII and it was initially used as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958, Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and decreed that the &quot;Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ&quot; be celebrated every year on Shrove Tuesday.

In 1936, Pius XII had referred to the Shroud as a &quot;holy thing perhaps like nothing else&quot;. In 1998, Pope John Paul II called the Shroud a &quot;distinguished relic&quot; and &quot;a mirror of the Gospel&quot;. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, called it an &quot;icon written with the blood of a whipped man, crowned with thorns, crucified and pierced on his right side&quot;. In 2013, Pope Francis referred to it as an &quot;icon of a man scourged and crucified&quot;. Some members of other Christian denominations, such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.

In 1983, the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the House of Savoy. However, as with all relics of this kind, the Roman Catholic Church made no pronouncements on its authenticity. As with other approved Catholic devotions, the matter has been left to the personal decision of the faithful, as long as the Church does not issue a future notification to the contrary. In the Church&#x27;s view, whether the cloth is authentic or not has no bearing whatsoever on the validity of what Jesus taught or on the saving power of his death and resurrection.

Pope John Paul II stated in 1998 that: &quot;Since it is not a matter of faith, the Church has no specific competence to pronounce on these questions. She entrusts to scientists the task of continuing to investigate, so that satisfactory answers may be found to the questions connected with this Sheet.&quot; Pope John Paul II showed himself to be deeply moved by the image of the Shroud and arranged for public showings in 1998 and 2000. In his address at the Turin Cathedral on Sunday 24 May 1998 (the occasion of the 100th year of Secondo Pia&#x27;s 28 May 1898 photograph), he said: &quot;The Shroud is an image of God&#x27;s love as well as of human sin... The imprint left by the tortured body of the Crucified One, which attests to the tremendous human capacity for causing pain and death to one&#x27;s fellow man, stands as an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age.&quot;

On 30 March 2013, as part of the Easter celebrations, there was an exposition of the shroud in the Cathedral of Turin. Pope Francis recorded a video message for the occasion, in which he described the image on the shroud as &quot;this Icon of a man&quot;, and stated that &quot;the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; In his carefully worded statement, Pope Francis urged the faithful to contemplate the shroud with awe, but &quot;stopped firmly short of asserting its authenticity&quot;.

Pope Francis went on a pilgrimage to Turin on 21 June 2015, to pray before and venerate the Holy Shroud and honor St. John Bosco on the of his birth.

==Scientific analysis==

Sindonology (from the Greek σινδών—sindon, the word used in the Gospel of Mark to describe the type of the burial cloth of Jesus) is the formal study of the Shroud. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites the first use of this word in 1964: &quot;The investigation ... assumed the stature of a separate discipline and was given a name, sindonology,&quot; but also identifies the use of &quot;sindonological&quot; in 1950 and &quot;sindonologist&quot; in 1953.

Secondo Pia&#x27;s 1898 photographs of the shroud allowed the scientific community to begin to study it. A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: &quot;material analysis&quot; (both chemical and historical), &quot;biology and medical forensics&quot; and &quot;image analysis&quot;.

===Early studies===
The first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969–1973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.

In 1976, physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used image analysis technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977, these three scientists and over thirty other experts in various fields formed the Shroud of Turin Research Project. In 1978, this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.

Also in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at CSELT a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.

====Tests for pigments====
In October 1978, a team of scientists affiliated with STURP took 32 samples from the surface of the Shroud, using adhesive tape. Of those samples, 18 were taken from areas of the Shroud that showed a body or blood image, while 14 were taken from non-image areas. The chemical microscopist Walter McCrone, a leading expert in the forensic authentication of historical documents and works of art, examined the tapes using polarized light microscopy and other physical and chemical techniques. McCrone concluded that the Shroud&#x27;s body image had been painted with a dilute pigment of red ochre (a form of iron oxide) in a collagen tempera (i.e., gelatin) medium, using a technique similar to the grisaille employed in the 14th century by Simone Martini and other European artists. McCrone also found that the &quot;bloodstains&quot; in the image had been highlighted with vermilion (a bright red pigment made from mercury sulfide), also in a collagen tempera medium. McCrone reported that no actual blood was present in the samples taken from the Shroud.

Other members of STURP rejected McCrone&#x27;s conclusions and concluded, based on their own examination of the Shroud and the tape samples, that the image on the Shroud could not be explained by the presence of pigments. Mark Anderson, who was working for McCrone, analyzed the Shroud samples. In his book Ray Rogers states that Anderson, who was McCrone&#x27;s Raman microscopy expert, concluded that the samples acted as organic material when he subjected them to the laser. McCrone resigned from STURP in June 1980, after giving back all of the tape samples in his possession to Ray Rogers.

John Heller and Alan Adler examined the same samples and agreed with McCrone&#x27;s result that the cloth contains iron oxide. However, they argued that the exceptional purity of the chemical and comparisons with other ancient textiles showed that, while retting flax absorbs iron selectively, the iron itself was not the source of the image on the shroud.

After his analysis of the Shroud was first published in 1980, McCrone continued to argue in journal articles, public lectures, and in the book &quot;Judgment Day for the Shroud of Turin&quot; (which appeared in 1996), that the Shroud had been painted in the 14th century and that it showed no traces of actual blood. He also argued that the members of STURP lacked relevant expertise in the chemical microanalysis of historical artworks and that their non-detection of pigment in the Shroud&#x27;s image was &quot;consistent with the sensitivity of the instruments and techniques they used.&quot; For his work on the Shroud, McCrone was awarded the American Chemical Society&#x27;s National Award in Analytical Chemistry in 2000.

===Radiocarbon dating===
Radiocarbon dating has established that the shroud is medieval, and not from the time of Jesus.

Independent radiocarbon dating tests were carried out in 1988 at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, following years of discussion to obtain permission from the Holy See. The tests were done on portions of a swatch taken from a corner of the shroud, and concluded with 95% confidence that the material dated to 1260–1390 AD. The dating matches the first appearance of the shroud in church history. This dating is also slightly more recent than that estimated by art historian W. S. A. Dale, who postulated on artistic grounds that the shroud is an 11th-century icon made for use in worship services.

Some proponents for the authenticity of the shroud have attempted to discount the radiocarbon dating result by claiming that the sample may represent a medieval &quot;Invisible mending&quot; repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth. However, all of the hypotheses used to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted, including the medieval repair hypothesis, the bio-contamination hypothesis and the carbon monoxide hypothesis.

In recent years, the radiocarbon dating data have been repeatedly statistically analysed, in attempts to draw some conclusions about the reliability of the C14 dating from studying the data rather than studying the shroud itself. The studies have all concluded that the data lack homogeneity, which might be due to unidentified abnormalities in the fabric tested, or to differences in the pre-testing cleaning processes used by the different laboratories. The most recent analysis (2020) found that &quot;If the Zurich and Tucson data were displaced upward by 88 RCY as shown in the figure all of the results would agree within the uncertainty observed. Indeed, if the magnitude of the “adjustment” were as small as ~10 RCY, the  analysis would confirm a statistical homogeneity assuming the uncertainties in the data did not change.&quot;

===Material historical analysis===
====Historical fabrics====

In 1998, shroud researcher Joe Nickell wrote that no examples of herringbone weave are known from the time of Jesus. The few samples of burial cloths that are known from the era are made using plain weave. In 2000, fragments of a burial shroud from the 1st century were discovered in a tomb near Jerusalem, believed to have belonged to a Jewish high priest or member of the aristocracy. Based on this discovery, the researchers concluded that the Turin Shroud did not originate from Jesus-era Jerusalem.

===Biological and medical forensics===

====Blood stains====
There are several reddish stains on the shroud suggesting blood, but it is uncertain whether these stains were produced at the same time as the image, or afterwards. McCrone (see painting hypothesis) showed that these contain iron oxide, and theorised that its presence was likely due to simple pigment materials used in medieval times.

Skeptics cite forensic blood tests whose results dispute the authenticity of the Shroud, and point to the possibility that the blood could belong to a person who handled the shroud, and that the apparent blood flows on the shroud are unrealistically neat.

====Flowers and pollen====

A study published in 2011 by Salvatore Lorusso of the University of Bologna and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or anything else on either image.

In 2015, Italian researchers Barcaccia et al. published a new study in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot;. They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant taxa, including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human mtDNA, sequences were found belonging to haplogroups that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada. After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places came in contact with the shroud. According to the scientists, &quot;such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East. Furthermore, the results raise the possibility of an Indian manufacture of the linen cloth.&quot;

====Anatomical forensics====

A number of studies on the anatomical consistency of the image on the shroud and the nature of the wounds on it have been performed, following the initial study by Yves Delage in 1902. While Delage declared the image anatomically flawless, others have presented arguments to support both authenticity and forgery.

The analysis of a crucified Roman, discovered near Venice in 2007, shows heel wounds that are consistent with those found on Jehohanan but which are not consistent with wounds depicted on the shroud. Also, neither of the crucifixion victims known to archaeology show evidence of wrist wounds.

Joe Nickell in 1983, and Gregory S. Paul in 2010, separately state that the proportions of the image are not realistic. Paul stated that the face and proportions of the shroud image are impossible, that the figure cannot represent that of an actual person and that the posture was inconsistent. They argued that the forehead on the shroud is too small; and that the arms are too long and of different lengths and that the distance from the eyebrows to the top of the head is non representative. They concluded that the features can be explained if the shroud is a work of a Gothic artist. As Raymond E. Brown noticed, a corpse in the relaxed position portrayed on the shroud could not be positioned such that its hand covers its genitals as portrayed. The right arm and hand in the image appear to have been elongated to make this possible.

In 2018, an experimental Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) was performed to study the behaviour of blood flows from the wounds of a crucified person, and to compare this to the evidence on the Turin Shroud. The comparison between different tests demonstrated that the blood patterns on the forearms and on the back of the hand are not connected, and would have had to occur at different times, as a result of a very specific sequence of movements. In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times. These inconsistencies suggest that the Turin linen was an artistic or &quot;didactic&quot; representation, rather than an authentic burial shroud.

===Image and text analysis===
====Image analysis====
Both art-historical digital image processing and analog techniques have been applied to the shroud images.

In 1976, scientists used NASA imaging equipment to analyse a photograph of the shroud image and decoded the shroud image into a three-dimensional image.
Optical physicist and former STURP member John Dee German has noted that it is not difficult to make a photograph which has 3D qualities. If the object being photographed is lit from the front, and a non-reflective &quot;fog&quot; of some sort exists between the camera and the object, then less light will reach and reflect back from the portions of the object that are farther from the lens, thus creating a contrast which is dependent on distance.

The front image on the shroud is long, and is not exactly the same size as the rear image, which is long. Analysis of the images found them to be compatible with the shroud having been used to wrap a body long.

The image could be compared to oshiguma, the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan. Furthermore, the subject&#x27;s physical appearance corresponds to Byzantine iconography.

The Shroud cloth is composed of threads of a nominal diameter of 0.15 mm, woven with fibers of linen with a diameter of about 10-20 μm.

The Shroud image is a faint and superficial image caused by a translucent and discontinuous yellow discoloration of the fibers. In the points where the image is present, the discoloration affects only two or three fibers on the topmost part of the threads of the cloth. In each fiber, the yellow discoloration penetrates only for 200 nm in the external cell layer.

A fiber is not necessarily colored for all its length, but, in the parts where it is, it has the property of being colored all around its cylindrical surface.

Under the crossing threads of the weave, the image is not present.

The discoloration seems caused by a kind of dehydrative oxidation process, which has discolored and chemically altered the surfaces of certain surface fibrils.

The image of the Shroud is an areal density image, in the sense that the levels of darkness are not given by variations of the color, which instead is approximately constant all over the image, but by a variation of the number of yellowed fibers per unit area. Therefore, it can be considered a halftone image. Furthermore, there is no difference in terms of distribution of fiber coloration and maximum densities between the front and the rear of the image.

While the blood images could have come from a contact mechanism, the body image could not. The mapping between body-only image densities and expected cloth–body distances is not consistent with the image having been formed by direct contact with a body, as it is present even when it does not seem possible for the cloth to be in contact with the body.

===Hypotheses on image origin===
==== Painting ====

According to Walter McCrone, the technique used for producing the image on the shroud could well be the same as a medieval grisaille method described in Sir Charles Lock Eastlake&#x27;s &quot;Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters&quot; (1847). Eastlake describes in the chapter &quot;Practice of Painting Generally During the XIVth Century&quot; a special technique of painting on linen using tempera paint, which produces images with unusual transparent features that McCrone compares to the image on the shroud. McCrone also argued that the current image on the shroud may be fainter than the original painting, due to the rubbing off of the ochre pigment from the tops of the exposed linen fibers over the course of several centuries of handling and exhibition of the fabric.

==== Acid pigmentation ====
In 2009, Luigi Garlaschelli, professor of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, stated that he had made a full size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin using only medieval technologies. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet over a volunteer and then rubbed it with an acidic pigment. The shroud was then aged in an oven before being washed to remove the pigment. He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original. Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermic measurements at the University of Padua, commented that &quot;the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics&quot;.

Garlaschelli&#x27;s reproduction was shown in a 2010 National Geographic documentary. Garlaschelli&#x27;s technique included the bas-relief approach (described below) but only for the image of the face. The resultant image was visibly similar to the Turin Shroud, though lacking the uniformity and detail of the original.

====Medieval photography====

The art historian Nicholas Allen has proposed that the image on the shroud could have been formed as early as the 13th century using techniques described in the 1011 &quot;Book of Optics&quot;.
However, according to Mike Ware, a chemist and expert on the history of photography, Allen&#x27;s proposal &quot;encounters serious obstacles with regard to the technical history of the lens. Such claimants tend to draw upon the wisdom of hindsight to project a distorted historical perspective, wherein their cases rest upon a particular concatenation of procedures which is exceedingly improbable; and their &#x27;proofs&#x27; amount only to demonstrating (none too faithfully) that it was not totally impossible.&quot; Among other difficulties, Allen&#x27;s hypothesized process would have required that the subject (a corpse) be exposed in the sunlight for months.

====Dust-transfer technique====
Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have attempted to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, which could have been done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.

====Bas-relief====
In 1978, Joe Nickell noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to produce the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a bas-relief might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in &quot;Popular Photography&quot; magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step. Other researchers later replicated this process.

In 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of ferric oxide and gelatine. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.

Instead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object—thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.

====Maillard reaction====
The Maillard reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The cellulose fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin carbohydrate layer of starch fractions, various sugars, and other impurities. The potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body, and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud. Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas. Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.

==Fringe theories==
===Images of coins, flowers, and writing===
Various people claim to have detected images of flowers on the shroud as well as coins over the eyes of the face in the image, writing, and other objects. However, a study published in 2011 by Lorusso and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or writing or any other additional objects on the shroud in either photograph, they noted the faint images were &quot;only visible by incrementing the photographic contrast&quot; so they concluded that these signs might be linked to protuberances in the yarn and possibly also to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931. The use of coins to cover the eyes of the dead is not attested for 1st-century Judea. The existence of the coin images is rejected by most scientists.

===Pray Codex===
An image in the medieval manuscript of the Pray Codex (c. 1192–1195) has generated a debate among some believers since 1978. Although the Pray Codex predates the Shroud of Turin, some of the assumed features of the drawing, including the four L-shaped holes on the coffin lid, have pointed some people towards a possible attempted representation of the linen cloth. However the image on the Pray Codex has crosses on what may be one side of the supposed shroud, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images. A crumpled cloth can be seen discarded on the coffin, and the text of the codex fails to mention any miraculous image on the codex shroud.

===Radiation processes===
Some proponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin have argued that the image on the shroud was created by some form of radiation emission at the &quot;moment of resurrection&quot;. However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that this theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics, while agreeing that the darkening of the fabric could be produced by exposure to light (and predicting that despite the fact that the Shroud is normally stored in darkness and rarely displayed, it will eventually become darker in the future). Raymond Rogers also criticized the theory, saying: &quot;It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin. Corona discharges or plasmas made no contribution to image formation.&quot; Even if ultraviolet radiation were proven to have formed the image, it cannot be proven that it was not natural, that of the sun, applied to the prepared cloth unevenly to create the image.

<text>The Seven Days Battles were a series of seven battles over seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right.

The Seven Days began on Wednesday, June 25, 1862, with a Union attack in the minor Battle of Oak Grove, but McClellan quickly lost the initiative as Lee began a series of attacks at Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) on June 26, Gaines&#x27;s Mill on June 27, the minor actions at Garnett&#x27;s and Golding&#x27;s Farm on June 27 and 28, and the attack on the Union rear guard at Savage&#x27;s Station on June 29. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac continued its retreat toward the safety of Harrison&#x27;s Landing on the James River. Lee&#x27;s final opportunity to intercept the Union Army was at the Battle of Glendale on June 30, but poorly executed orders and the delay of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s troops allowed his enemy to escape to a strong defensive position on Malvern Hill. At the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, Lee launched futile frontal assaults and suffered heavy casualties in the face of strong infantry and artillery defenses.

The Seven Days ended with McClellan&#x27;s army in relative safety next to the James River, having suffered almost 16,000 casualties during the retreat. Lee&#x27;s army, which had been on the offensive during the Seven Days, lost over 20,000. As Lee became convinced that McClellan would not resume his threat against Richmond, he moved north for the northern Virginia campaign and the Maryland campaign.

==Background==

===Military situation===

===The Peninsula campaign===

The Peninsula campaign was the unsuccessful attempt by McClellan to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond and end the war. It started in March 1862, when McClellan landed his army at Fort Monroe and moved northwest, up the Virginia Peninsula beginning in early April. Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder&#x27;s defensive position on the Warwick Line caught McClellan by surprise. His hopes for a quick advance foiled, McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a siege of Yorktown. Just before the siege preparations were completed, the Confederates, now under the direct command of Johnston, began a withdrawal toward Richmond.

The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5), in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories, but the Confederates continued their withdrawal. An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham&#x27;s Landing (May 7) was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat. In the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff (May 15), an attempt by the United States Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed.

As McClellan&#x27;s army reached the outskirts of Richmond, a minor battle occurred at Hanover Court House (May 27), but it was followed by a surprise attack by Johnston at the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks on May 31 and June 1. The battle was inconclusive, with heavy casualties, but it had lasting effects on the campaign. Johnston was wounded and replaced on June 1 by the more aggressive Robert E. Lee. Lee spent almost a month extending his defensive lines and organizing his Army of Northern Virginia; McClellan accommodated this by sitting passively to his front, waiting for dry weather and roads, until the start of the Seven Days. Lee, who had developed a reputation for caution early in the war, knew he had no numerical superiority over McClellan, but he planned an offensive campaign that was the first indication of the aggressive nature he would display for the remainder of the war.

===Planning for offensives===
Lee&#x27;s initial attack plan, similar to Johnston&#x27;s plan at Seven Pines, was complex and required expert coordination and execution by all of his subordinates, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union Army. It was developed at a meeting on June 23. The Union Army straddled the rain-swollen Chickahominy River, with the bulk of the army, four corps, arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The remainder, the V Corps under Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, was north of the river near Mechanicsville in an L-shaped line facing north–south behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy. Lee&#x27;s plan was to cross the Chickahominy with the bulk of his army to attack the Union north flank, leaving only two divisions (under Maj. Gens. Benjamin Huger and John B. Magruder) to hold a line of entrenchments against McClellan&#x27;s superior strength. This would concentrate about 65,500 troops to oppose 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond and to contain the other 60,000 men of the Union Army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had reconnoitered Porter&#x27;s right flank—as part of a daring but militarily dubious circumnavigation of the entire Union Army from June 12 to 15—and found it vulnerable.

Lee intended for Jackson to attack Porter&#x27;s right flank early on the morning of June 26, and A.P. Hill would move from Meadow Bridge to Beaver Dam Creek, which flows into the Chickahominy, advancing on the Federal trenches. (Lee hoped that Porter would evacuate his trenches under pressure, obviating the need for a direct frontal assault.) Following this, Longstreet and D.H. Hill would pass through Mechanicsville and join the battle. Huger and Magruder would provide diversions on their fronts to distract McClellan as to Lee&#x27;s real intentions. Lee hoped that Porter would be overwhelmed from two sides by the mass of 65,000 men, and the two leading Confederate divisions would move on Cold Harbor and cut McClellan&#x27;s communications with White House Landing.

McClellan also planned an offensive. He had received intelligence that Lee was prepared to move and that the arrival of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s force from the Shenandoah Valley was imminent (McClellan was aware of Jackson&#x27;s presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter&#x27;s vulnerable corps north of the river). He decided to resume the offensive before Lee could. Anticipating Jackson&#x27;s reinforcements marching from the north, he increased cavalry patrols on likely avenues of approach. He wanted to advance his siege artillery about a mile and a half closer to the city by taking the high ground on Nine Mile Road around Old Tavern. In preparation for that, he planned an attack on Oak Grove, south of Old Tavern and the Richmond and York River Railroad, which would position his men to attack Old Tavern from two directions.

==Opposing forces==
The armies that fought in the Seven Days Battles comprised almost 200,000 men, which offered the potential for the largest battles of the war. However, the inexperience or caution of the generals involved usually prevented the appropriate concentration of forces and mass necessary for decisive tactical victories.

The Confederate army was not a proper unified command as the Army of the Potomac was, but simply a thrown-together collection of all the troops that could be gathered for the defense of Richmond. This contributed to the poor coordination of the army during the battles and the inability of Robert E. Lee to destroy the Union army.

The average strength of a division in the Army of the Potomac was about 9000 men (including non-combatants) with Casey&#x27;s division being the smallest at around 7000 and Morell&#x27;s being the largest at 11,000 men. The average strength of Confederate divisions varied from 12,000 men (A.P. Hill&#x27;s division) to 5000 men (Theophilus Holmes&#x27;s division). Confederate reports listed only combat troops and excluded non-combatants such as couriers, staff officers, and wagon drivers. Jackson&#x27;s command was severely understrength from the Valley campaign and his own division had less than 2000 men, most of them being in the Stonewall Brigade while the brigades of Samuel Fulkerson and John R. Jones were down to nearly regimental size and were held in reserve for most of the Seven Days Battles. Ewell&#x27;s three brigades numbered 3000 men total. Jackson was reinforced with the brigade of Alexander Lawton, recently arrived from Georgia, and numbering 3500 men. This brought his total strength to around 8000 men.

D.H. Hill&#x27;s division numbered around 7700 men, having numbered close to 10,000 before the heavy losses at Seven Pines. They were reinforced with Roswell Ripley&#x27;s brigade, newly arrived from North Carolina, and numbering 2300 men, bringing the total strength of Hill&#x27;s command to 10,000 men. James Longstreet&#x27;s division numbered 9050 men on June 25 according to army ordnance chief Edward P. Alexander. It had numbered close to 12,000 men prior to losses at Seven Pines. Benjamin Huger&#x27;s division numbered approximately 8600 men. William Whiting had around 4000 men in his two brigades. John Magruder&#x27;s three divisions numbered about 13,000 men.

===Union===


McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac, with approximately 105,000 men, was organized largely as it had been at Seven Pines.
* II Corps, Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Israel B. Richardson and John Sedgwick.
* III Corps, Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny.
* IV Corps, Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Darius N. Couch and John J. Peck.
* V Corps, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. George W. Morell, George Sykes, and George A. McCall.
* VI Corps, Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Henry W. Slocum and William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith.
* Reserve forces included the cavalry reserve under Brig. Gen. Philip St. George Cooke (Jeb Stuart&#x27;s father-in-law) and the supply base at White House Landing under Brig. Gen. Silas Casey.

===Confederate===


Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia was larger than the one he inherited from Johnston, and, at about 92,000 men, the largest Confederate army assembled during the war.
* Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, having just arrived from his victories in the Valley campaign, commanded a force consisting of his own division (now commanded by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder) and those of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting, and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill.
* Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill&#x27;s &quot;Light Division&quot; (which was so named because it traveled light and was able to maneuver and strike quickly) consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens. Charles W. Field, Maxcy Gregg, Joseph R. Anderson, Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch, James J. Archer, and William Dorsey Pender.
* Maj. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens. James L. Kemper, Richard H. Anderson, George E. Pickett, Cadmus M. Wilcox, Roger A. Pryor, and Winfield Scott Featherston. Longstreet also had operational command over Hill&#x27;s Light Division.
* Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder commanded the divisions of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, Brig. Gen. David R. Jones, and Magruder&#x27;s own division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb.
* Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger&#x27;s division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens. William Mahone, Ambrose R. Wright, Lewis A. Armistead, and Robert Ransom, Jr.
* Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes&#x27; division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel, John G. Walker, Henry A. Wise, and the cavalry brigade of Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart.

==Battles==

===Oak Grove===

McClellan planned to advance to the west, along the axis of the Williamsburg Road, in the direction of Richmond. Between the two armies was a small, dense forest, wide, bisected by the headwaters of White Oak Swamp. Two divisions of the III Corps were selected for the assault, commanded by Brig. Gens. Joseph Hooker and Philip Kearny. Facing them was the division of Confederate Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger.

Soon after 8 a.m., June 25, the Union brigades of Brig. Gens. Daniel E. Sickles (the Excelsior Brigade), Cuvier Grover, both of Hooker&#x27;s division, and John C. Robinson stepped off. Although Robinson and Grover made good progress on the left and in the center, Sickles&#x27;s New Yorkers encountered difficulties moving through their abatis, then through the upper portions of the creek, and finally met stiff Confederate resistance, all of which threw the Federal line out of alignment. Huger took advantage of the confusion by launching a counterattack with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright against Grover&#x27;s brigade. At a crucial moment in the battle, the 26th North Carolina of Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom&#x27;s brigade, in their first combat engagement, delivered a perfectly synchronized volley of rifle fire against Sickles&#x27;s brigade, breaking up its delayed attack and sending the 71st New York into a panicked retreat, which Sickles described as &quot;disgraceful confusion.&quot;

Heintzelman ordered reinforcements sent forward and also notified army commander McClellan, who was attempting to manage the battle by telegraph from away. McClellan ordered his men to withdraw back to their entrenchments, mystifying his subordinates on the scene. Arriving at the front at 1 p.m., seeing that the situation was not as bad as he had feared, McClellan ordered his men forward to retake the ground for which they had already fought once that day. The fighting lasted until nightfall.

The minor battle was McClellan&#x27;s only tactical offensive action against Richmond. His attack gained only at a cost of over 1,000 casualties on both sides and was not strong enough to derail the offensive planned by Robert E. Lee, which had already been set in motion.

Lee&#x27;s plan called for Jackson to begin the attack on Porter&#x27;s north flank early on June 26. A.P. Hill&#x27;s Light Division was to advance from Meadow Bridge when he heard Jackson&#x27;s guns, clear the Union pickets from Mechanicsville, and then move to Beaver Dam Creek. D.H. Hill and Longstreet were to pass through Mechanicsville and support Jackson and A.P. Hill. South of the river, Magruder and Huger were to demonstrate to deceive the four Union corps on their front.

Lee&#x27;s intricate plan went awry immediately. Jackson&#x27;s men, fatigued from their recent campaign and lengthy march, ran at least four hours behind schedule. By 3 p.m., A.P. Hill grew impatient and began his attack without orders, a frontal assault with 11,000 men. Porter extended and strengthened his right flank and fell back to concentrate along Beaver Dam Creek and Ellerson&#x27;s Mill. There, 14,000 well entrenched soldiers, aided by 32 guns in six batteries, repulsed repeated Confederate attacks with substantial casualties.
Jackson and his command arrived late in the afternoon and he ordered his troops to bivouac for the evening while a major battle was raging within earshot. His proximity to Porter&#x27;s flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain&#x27;s Swamp, to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the James River. He also believed that the diversions by Huger and Magruder south of the river meant that he was seriously outnumbered. (He reported to Washington that he faced 200,000 Confederates, but there were actually 85,000.) This was a strategic decision of grave importance because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he would be forced to abandon his siege of Richmond. A.P. Hill, now with Longstreet and D.H. Hill behind him, continued his attack, despite orders from Lee to hold his ground. His assault was beaten back with heavy casualties.

Overall, the battle was a Union tactical victory, in which the Confederates suffered significant casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee&#x27;s plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy&#x27;s flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter&#x27;s 361. Despite the short-term Union success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative.

===Gaines&#x27;s Mill===
By the morning of June 27, the Union forces were concentrated into a semicircle with Porter collapsing his line into an east–west salient north of the river and the four corps south of the river remaining in their original positions. McClellan ordered Porter to hold Gaines&#x27;s Mill at all costs so that the army could change its base of supply to the James River. Several of McClellan&#x27;s subordinates urged him to attack Magruder&#x27;s division south of the river, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and refused to capitalize on the overwhelming superiority he actually held on that front.

Lee continued his offensive on June 27, launching the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. A.P. Hill resumed his attack across Beaver Dam Creek early in the morning, but found the line lightly defended. By early afternoon, he ran into strong opposition where Porter had deployed along Boatswain&#x27;s Creek; the swampy terrain was a major obstacle to the attack. As Longstreet arrived to the south of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill&#x27;s left.

For the second time in the Seven Days, however, Jackson was late. D.H. Hill attacked the Federal right and was held off by the division of Brig. Gen. George Sykes; he backed off to await Jackson&#x27;s arrival. Longstreet was ordered to conduct a diversionary attack to stabilize the lines until Jackson could arrive and attack from the north. In Longstreet&#x27;s attack, Brig. Gen. George E. Pickett&#x27;s brigade attempted a frontal assault and was beaten back under severe fire with heavy losses. Jackson finally reached D.H. Hill&#x27;s position at 3 p.m. and began his assault at 4:30 p.m.

Porter&#x27;s line was saved by Brig. Gen. Henry W. Slocum&#x27;s division moving into position to bolster his defense. Shortly after dark, the Confederates mounted another attack, poorly coordinated, but this time collapsing the Federal line. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood&#x27;s Texas Brigade opened a gap in the line, as did Pickett&#x27;s Brigade on its second attempt of the day. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter withdrew across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him.

For the second day, Magruder was able to continue fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor diversionary attacks. He was able to occupy 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river.

Gaines&#x27;s Mill was the only clear-cut Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured). Since the Confederate assault was conducted against only a small portion of the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. However, although McClellan had already planned to shift his supply base to the James River, his defeat unnerved him and he precipitously decided to abandon his advance on Richmond.

===Union withdrawal===
The night of June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to withdraw to a secure base at Harrison&#x27;s Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army was in a good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it to be sent to the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: &quot;If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or any other persons in Washington—you have done your best to sacrifice this Army.&quot; (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.)

McClellan ordered Keyes&#x27;s IV Corps to move west of Glendale and protect the army&#x27;s withdrawal, while Porter was sent to the high ground at Malvern Hill to develop defensive positions. The supply trains were ordered to move south toward the river. McClellan departed for Harrison&#x27;s Landing without specifying any exact routes of withdrawal and without designating a second-in-command. For the remainder of the Seven Days, he had no direct command of the battles. The Union retreat across the Chickahominy after Gaines&#x27;s Mill was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, signaling that Richmond was out of danger.

Lee&#x27;s cavalry reported that Union troops had abandoned their defense of the Richmond and York River Railroad and the White House supply depot on the York River. That information, plus the sighting of large dust clouds south of the Chickahominy River, finally convinced Lee that McClellan was heading for the James. Until this time, Lee anticipated that McClellan would be withdrawing to the east to protect his supply line to the York River and positioned his forces to react to that, unable to act decisively while he awaited evidence of McClellan&#x27;s intentions.

===Garnett&#x27;s &amp; Golding&#x27;s Farm===

While Lee&#x27;s main attack at Gaines&#x27;s Mill was progressing on June 27, the Confederates south of the Chickahominy performed a reconnaissance in force to determine the location of McClellan&#x27;s retreating army. Magruder ordered Brig. Gen. Robert A. Toombs&#x27;s brigade forward to &quot;feel the enemy.&quot; Toombs, a Georgia politician with a disdain for professional officers, instead launched a sharp attack at dusk against Baldy Smith&#x27;s VI Corps division near Old Tavern at the farm of James M. Garnett. The attack was easily repulsed by the brigade of Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.

On June 28, Toombs again was ordered to conduct a reconnaissance, but turned it into an attack over the same ground, meeting the enemy at the farm of Simon Gouldin (also known as Golding). Toombs took it upon himself to order his fellow brigade commander, Col. George T. Anderson, to join the assault. Two of Anderson&#x27;s regiments, the 7th and 8th Georgia, preceded Toombs&#x27;s brigade into the assault and were subjected to a vigorous Federal counterattack by the 49th Pennsylvania and 43rd New York, losing 156 men.

These were the only attacks south of the Chickahominy River in conjunction with Gaines&#x27;s Mill, but they helped to convince McClellan that he was being subjected to attacks from all directions, increasing his anxiety and his determination to get his army to safety at the James.

===Savage&#x27;s Station===

On Sunday, June 29, the bulk of McClellan&#x27;s army concentrated around Savage&#x27;s Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, a Federal supply depot since just before Seven Pines, preparing for a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines&#x27;s Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command. Clouds of black smoke filled the air as the Union troops were ordered to burn anything they could not carry. Union morale plummeted, particularly so for those wounded, who realized that they were not being evacuated from Savage&#x27;s Station with the rest of the Army.

Lee devised a complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan&#x27;s army. Longstreet&#x27;s and A.P. Hill&#x27;s divisions looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, Holmes&#x27;s division headed farther south, to the vicinity of Malvern Hill, and Magruder&#x27;s division was ordered to move due east to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding three divisions, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage&#x27;s Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army to turn around and fight during its retreat. McClellan&#x27;s rear guard at Savage&#x27;s Station consisted five divisions from Sumner&#x27;s II Corps, Heintzelman&#x27;s III Corps, and Franklin&#x27;s VI Corps. McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard.

Initial contact between the armies occurred at 9 a.m. on June 29, a four-regiment fight about west of Savage&#x27;s Station, lasting for about two hours before disengaging. Meanwhile, Jackson was not advancing as Lee had planned. He was taking time to rebuild bridges over the Chickahominy and he received a garbled order from Lee&#x27;s chief of staff that made him believe he should stay north of the river and guard the crossings. These failures of the Confederate plan were being matched on the Union side, however. Heintzelman decided on his own that his corps was not needed to defend Savage&#x27;s Station, so he decided to follow the rest of the army without informing his fellow generals.

Magruder was faced with the problem of attacking Sumner&#x27;s 26,600 men with his own 14,000. He hesitated until 5 p.m., when he sent only two and a half brigades forward. Union artillery opened fire and pickets were sent forward to meet the assault. The two brigade front of Kershaw and Semmes began to push the narrow defensive line of one of Sedgwick&#x27;s brigades. Sumner managed this part of the battle erratically, selecting regiments for combat from multiple brigades almost at random. By the time all of these units reached the front, the two sides were at rough parity—two brigades each. Although Magruder had been conservative about his attack, Sumner was even more so. Of the 26 regiments he had in his corps, only 10 were engaged at Savage&#x27;s Station.

The fighting turned into a bloody stalemate as darkness fell and strong thunderstorms began to move in. The &quot;Land Merrimack&quot;—the first instance of an armored railroad battery to be used in combat—bombarded the Union front, with some of its shells reaching as far to the rear as the field hospital. The final action of the evening was as the Vermont Brigade, attempting to hold the flank south of the Williamsburg Road, charged into the woods and were met with murderous fire, suffering more casualties of any brigade on the field that day.

There were about 1,500 casualties on both sides, plus 2,500 previously wounded Union soldiers who were left to be captured when their field hospital was evacuated. Stonewall Jackson eventually crossed the river by about 2:30 a.m. on June 30, but it was too late to crush the Union Army, as Lee had hoped. General Lee reprimanded Magruder, but the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee&#x27;s own headquarters and a less than aggressive performance by Jackson.

===Glendale and White Oak Swamp===

Most elements of the Union Army had been able to cross White Oak Swamp Creek by noon on June 30. About one third of the army had reached the James River, but the remainder was still marching between White Oak Swamp and Glendale. After inspecting the line of march that morning, McClellan rode south and boarded the ironclad USS &quot;Galena&quot; on the James.

Lee ordered his army to converge on the retreating Union forces, bottlenecked on the inadequate road network. The Army of the Potomac, lacking overall command coherence, presented a discontinuous, ragged defensive line. Stonewall Jackson was ordered to press the Union rear guard at the White Oak Swamp crossing while the largest part of Lee&#x27;s army, some 45,000 men, would attack the Army of the Potomac in mid-retreat at Glendale, about southwest, splitting it in two. Huger&#x27;s division would strike first after a three-mile (5 km) march on the Charles City Road, supported by Longstreet and A.P. Hill, whose divisions were about to the west, in a mass attack. Holmes was ordered to capture Malvern Hill.

The Confederate plan was once again marred by poor execution. Huger&#x27;s men were slowed by felled trees obstructing the Charles City Road, spending hours chopping a new road through the thick woods. Huger failed to take any alternative route, and, fearing a counterattack, failed to participate in the battle. Magruder marched around aimlessly, unable to decide whether he should be aiding Longstreet or Holmes; by 4 p.m., Lee ordered Magruder to join Holmes on the River Road and attack Malvern Hill. Stonewall Jackson moved slowly and spent the entire day north of the creek, making only feeble efforts to cross and attack Franklin&#x27;s VI Corps in the Battle of White Oak Swamp, attempting to rebuild a destroyed bridge (although adequate fords were nearby), and engaging in a pointless artillery duel. Jackson&#x27;s inaction allowed some units to be detached from Franklin&#x27;s corps in late afternoon to reinforce the Union troops at Glendale. Holmes&#x27;s relatively inexperienced troops made no progress against Porter at Turkey Bridge on Malvern Hill, even with the reinforcements from Magruder, and were repulsed by effective artillery fire and by Federal gunboats on the James.

At 2 p.m., as they waited for sounds of Huger&#x27;s expected attack, Lee, Longstreet, and visiting Confederate President Jefferson Davis were conferring on horseback when they came under heavy artillery fire, wounding two men and killing three horses. A.P. Hill, the commander in that sector, ordered the president and senior generals to the rear. Longstreet attempted to silence the six batteries of Federal guns firing in his direction, but long-range artillery fire proved to be inadequate. He ordered Col. Micah Jenkins to charge the batteries, which brought on a general fight around 4 p.m.

Although belated and not initiated as planned, the assaults by the divisions of A.P. Hill and Longstreet, under Longstreet&#x27;s overall command, turned out to be the only ones to follow Lee&#x27;s order to attack the main Union concentration. Longstreet&#x27;s 20,000 men were not reinforced by other Confederate divisions of Huger and Jackson, despite their concentration within a three-mile (5 km) radius. They assaulted the disjointed Union line of 40,000 men, arranged in a two-mile (3 km) arc north and south of the Glendale intersection, but the brunt of the fighting was centered on the position held by the Pennsylvania Reserves division of the V Corps, 6,000 men under Brig. Gen. George A. McCall, just west of the Nelson Farm. (The farm was owned by R.H. Nelson, but its former owner was named Frayser and many of the locals referred to it as Frayser&#x27;s, or Frazier&#x27;s, Farm.)

Three Confederate brigades made the assault, but Longstreet ordered them forward in a piecemeal fashion, over several hours. Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper&#x27;s Virginians charged through the thick woods first and emerged in front of five batteries of McCall&#x27;s artillery. In their first combat experience, the brigade conducted a disorderly but enthusiastic assault, which carried them through the guns and broke through McCall&#x27;s main line with Jenkins&#x27;s support, followed up a few hours later by Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox&#x27;s Alabamians. The Confederate brigades met stiff resistance in sometimes hand-to-hand combat.

On McCall&#x27;s flanks, the divisions of Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker (to the south) and Brig. Gens. Philip Kearny and Henry W. Slocum (to the north), held against repeated Confederate attacks. Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick&#x27;s division, which had units both in reserve and around White Oak Swamp, came up to fill a gap after a brutal counterattack. Heavy fighting continued until about 8:30 p.m. Longstreet committed virtually every brigade in the divisions under his command, while on the Union side they had been fed in individually to plug holes in the line as they occurred.

The battle was tactically inconclusive, although Lee failed to achieve his objective of preventing the Federal escape and crippling McClellan&#x27;s army, if not destroying it. Union casualties were 3,797, Confederate about the same at 3,673, but more than 40% higher in killed and wounded. Although Jackson&#x27;s wing of the army and Franklin&#x27;s corps comprised tens of thousands of men, the action at White Oak Swamp included no infantry activity and was limited to primarily an artillery duel with few casualties.

===Malvern Hill===

The final battle of the Seven Days was the first in which the Union Army occupied favorable ground. Malvern Hill offered good observation and artillery positions, having been prepared the previous day by Porter&#x27;s V Corps. McClellan himself was not present on the battlefield, having preceded his army to Harrison&#x27;s Landing on the James, and Porter was the most senior of the corps commanders. The slopes were cleared of timber, providing great visibility, and the open fields to the north could be swept by deadly fire from the 250 guns placed by Col. Henry J. Hunt, McClellan&#x27;s chief of artillery. Beyond this space, the terrain was swampy and thickly wooded. Almost the entire Army of the Potomac occupied the hill and the line extended in a vast semicircle from Harrison&#x27;s Landing on the extreme right to Brig. Gen. George W. Morell&#x27;s division of Porter&#x27;s corps on the extreme left, which occupied the geographically advantageous ground on the northwestern slopes of the hill.

Rather than flanking the position, Lee attacked it directly, hoping that his artillery would clear the way for a successful infantry assault. His plan was to attack the hill from the north on the Quaker Road, using the divisions of Stonewall Jackson, Richard S. Ewell, D.H. Hill, and Brig. Gen. William H.C. Whiting. Magruder was ordered to follow Jackson and deploy to his right when he reached the battlefield. Huger&#x27;s division was to follow as well, but Lee reserved the right to position him based on developments. The divisions of Longstreet and A.P. Hill, which had been the most heavily engaged in Glendale the previous day, were held in reserve.

Once again, Lee&#x27;s complex plan was poorly executed. The approaching soldiers were delayed by severely muddy roads and poor maps. Jackson arrived at the swampy creek called Western Run and stopped abruptly. Magruder&#x27;s guides mistakenly sent him on the Long Bridge Road to the southwest, away from the battlefield. Eventually the battle line was assembled with Huger&#x27;s division (brigades of Brig. Gens. Ambrose R. Wright and Lewis A. Armistead) on the Confederate right and D.H. Hill&#x27;s division (brigades of Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood and Col. Evander M. Law) on the Quaker Road to the left. They awaited the Confederate bombardment before attacking.

Unfortunately for Lee, Henry Hunt struck first, launching one of the greatest artillery barrages in the war from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. The Union gunners had superior equipment and expertise and disabled most of the Confederate batteries. Despite the setback, Lee sent his infantry forward at 3:30 p.m. and Armistead&#x27;s brigade made some progress through lines of Union sharpshooters. By 4 p.m., Magruder arrived and he was ordered forward to support Armistead. His attack was piecemeal and poorly organized. Meanwhile, D. H. Hill launched his division forward along the Quaker Road, past Willis Church. Across the entire line of battle, the Confederate troops reached only within of the Union Center and were repulsed by nightfall with heavy losses. Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill is quoted as saying that, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t war, it was murder.&quot;

Lee&#x27;s army suffered 5,355 casualties (versus 3,214 Union) in this wasted effort, but continued to follow the Union army all the way to Harrison&#x27;s Landing. On Evelington Heights, part of the property of Edmund Ruffin, the Confederates had an opportunity to dominate the Union camps, making their position on the bank of the James potentially untenable; although the Confederate position would be subjected to Union naval gunfire, the heights were an exceptionally strong defensive position that would have been very difficult for the Union to capture with infantry. Cavalry commander Jeb Stuart reached the heights and began bombardment with a single cannon. This alerted the Federals to the potential danger and they captured the heights before any Confederate infantry could reach the scene.

==Aftermath==
The Seven Days Battles ended the Peninsula Campaign. Malvern Hill was not a tenable position in which to stay, and the Army of the Potomac quickly withdrew to Harrison&#x27;s Landing, where it was protected by Union gunboats on the James River. The army was in no condition for a renewed offensive; nearly 16,000 men and officers had been killed, wounded, or captured between June 25 and July 1, particularly in the V Corps, which had done the heaviest fighting. Also, the survivors were extremely tired after a week of fighting and marching with little food or sleep, most of the artillery ammunition had been used up, and the summer weather was taking its toll with the army sick lists getting longer and longer. Meanwhile, the equally exhausted Army of Northern Virginia, with no reason to remain in the James bottomlands, pulled back to the Richmond lines to lick its wounds.

McClellan wrote a series of letters to the War Department to argue that he was facing upwards of 200,000 Confederates and that he needed major reinforcements to launch a renewed offensive on Richmond. McPherson notes that the maximum number of Army of Northern Virginia troops that Lee could bring was in fact 92,000. McClellan argued that by giving him the commands in Northern Virginia, troops from the Washington garrison, and whatever forces could be pulled from the West, he might have a fighting chance. General-in-Chief Henry Halleck replied that McClellan&#x27;s requests were impossible and that if the Confederate army was really as large as he claimed, trying to reinforce him with Pope and Burnside&#x27;s commands in Northern Virginia would be suicide since the Confederates could easily crush either Union army with their overwhelming strength. Halleck also pointed out that mosquito season was coming up in August–September, and remaining on the swampy Virginia Peninsula at that time of the year would be inviting a disastrous malaria and yellow fever epidemic. On August 4, the order came down for McClellan to withdraw from the Peninsula and to return to the Aquia Creek area at once.

Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia suffered about 20,000 casualties (3,494 killed, 15,758 wounded, and 952 captured or missing) out of a total of over 90,000 soldiers during the Seven Days. McClellan reported casualties of about 16,000 (1,734 killed, 8,062 wounded, and 6,053 captured or missing) out of a total of 105,445. Despite their victory, many Confederates were stunned by the losses. The number of casualties in the Seven Days Battles surpassed the total number of casualties in the Western Theater of the war until that point in the year.

The effects of the Seven Days Battles were widespread. After a successful start on the Peninsula, which foretold an early end to the war, Northern morale was crushed by McClellan&#x27;s retreat. Despite heavy casualties, which the less populated South could ill afford, and clumsy tactical performances by Lee and his generals, Confederate morale skyrocketed, and Lee was emboldened to continue his aggressive strategy through the Second Battle of Bull Run and the Maryland Campaign. McClellan&#x27;s previous position as general-in-chief of all the Union armies, which had been vacant since March, was filled on July 23, 1862, by Major General Henry W. Halleck, but McClellan retained command of the Army of the Potomac. Meanwhile, Robert E. Lee embarked on a thorough reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia by forming it into two corps, commanded by James Longstreet and Stonewall Jackson. Lee also removed several generals, such as John Magruder and Benjamin Huger, who had performed poorly during the Seven Days Battles.

<text>Ann &quot;Annie&quot; Nocenti (; born January 17, 1957) is an American journalist, filmmaker, teacher, comic book writer and editor. She is best known for her work at Marvel in the late 1980s, particularly a four-year stint as the editor of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (written by Chris Claremont) as well as her run as a writer of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, illustrated primarily by John Romita Jr. Nocenti has created such Marvel characters as Longshot, Mojo, Spiral, Blackheart and Typhoid Mary.

Nocenti is noted for her outspoken political views, including but not limited to animal rights and alcoholism, which characterized her run on &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

==Early life==
When Ann Nocenti was a child, her parents frowned upon comics, though there were some in her house, including Archie Comics, a &quot;Pogo&quot; anthology that Nocenti loved, and a &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; anthology whose grotesquely-rendered characters piqued Nocenti&#x27;s curiosity, more so than the heroes. Nocenti attended college at SUNY New Paltz, during which she discovered the work of Robert Crumb.

==Career==
===Comics===
After graduating from SUNY New Paltz, she discovered the superhero genre when she answered an ad in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, which led to her being given her first published comics job at Marvel Comics by editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil. Nocenti made her comics writing debut with a six-page mythological story, drawn by Greg LaRocque, in the Marvel anthology &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; #32 (August 1982). She got her first regular comics assignment with Marvel&#x27;s superhero series &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;, starting with issue #47 (December 1982). It was not a promising assignment; Marvel had already decided to end the series with issue #50 (June 1983) due to flagging sales. With heavy guidance from editor Mark Gruenwald (who had himself written the series for a time), Nocenti ended the series with the death of the titular character, a decision she came to regret. She recalled, &quot;It was before I understood the intense, personal attachment the readers have to the characters. In retrospect, I realized it wasn&#x27;t a nice thing to kill a character off. As I worked in the field for a while, I developed a strong personal attachment to a lot of characters and I realized how alive they were.&quot; Shortly after, Nocenti lent a hand to Spider-Woman&#x27;s resurrection in &quot;Avengers&quot; #240–241 as &quot;story consultant&quot;.

Nocenti wrote an issue each of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; before writing the four-issue miniseries &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (December 1984 – June 1985), featuring the superheroes Dazzler and the Beast. During this period Nocenti was on staff at Marvel, working as an assistant editor for Carl Potts on such titles as &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, and &quot;The Thing&quot;.
Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams created the character &quot;Longshot&quot; in a titular, six-issue miniseries (September 1985 – February 1986). Explaining the concept of the character, which Nocenti borrowed from existentialist writers, she states, &quot;Longshot is the idea of stripping someone of everything that they are. I never read comics, so the idea of a hero to me was different. I couldn&#x27;t think of it in terms of a &#x27;super hero&#x27; hero. I thought of it more as a conceptual hero. Not having a comic book background, I tend to come up with the metaphysics before I come up with the characters. I knew that I wanted to deal with the metaphysics of luck. It was a concept that interested me ... what luck is, what probability is, how you could shift probabilities towards yourself. What are the repercussions of that? So, I did a character centered around that idea. At the time, Nocenti was pursuing her Master&#x27;s degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine &quot;Lies of Our Times&quot;, and reading the work of writers such as Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Longshot&#x27;s archvillain, Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in the Nocenti&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;The New Mutants Summer Special&quot; in 1990, was also born of these works.

After collaborating with Adams on the Spider-Man feature in &quot;Web of Spider-Man Annual&quot; #2 (September 1986), and with penciler Mike Mignola on a short backup story there, Nocenti teamed with artist Barry Windsor-Smith on &quot;Daredevil&quot; #236 (November 1986). Two issues later, she became the regular writer for a four-and-a-quarter year run from #238–291 (January 1987 – April 1991), minus issues #246 and #258. John Romita Jr. joined as penciler from #250–282 (January 1988 – July 1990), and was generally inked by Al Williamson. Nocenti specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting sexism, racism, and nuclear proliferation while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist Typhoid Mary in issue #254 (May 1988). as well as the demon Blackheart in #270 (September 1989).

In addition to contributing occasional stories to such anthologies as &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; and &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, and writing a handful of Spider-Man fill-ins, Nocenti also produced the graphic novel &quot;Someplace Strange&quot; in collaboration with artist John Bolton. She also wrote &quot;The Inhumans Graphic Novel&quot; in 1988, and the 1998 X-Men novel &quot;Prisoner X&quot;.

In &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #150 (1994), Nocenti introduced Jessie Drake, a teenaged mutant, who revealed in issue #151 that she was transgender, marking Marvel&#x27;s first transgender mutant, and hero. After a 25-year absence, the character reappeared in &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Voices: Pride&quot; #1, which Marvel published in June 2021 as part of Pride Month.

For the DC Comics imprint Vertigo, Nocenti wrote the 16-issue run of &quot;Kid Eternity&quot; (May 1993 – September 1994). Later in the mid-1990s, for Marvel, she wrote a four-issue miniseries each starring Typhoid Mary and the supernatural supervillain Nightmare. After writing two issues of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The All New Exiles&quot; in 1996, plus the four-page dramatic story &quot;Old Man&quot;, with artist Bolton, in the Dark Horse Comics anthology &quot;Strange Wink&quot; #3 (May 1998), Nocenti left comics to pursue journalism. She returned briefly, in 2003 and 2004, writing four Batman stories for DC.

Nocenti was among the writers for &quot;Daredevil&quot; #500 published in August 2009.

Nocenti wrote &quot;Green Arrow&quot; starting with issue #7 published in March 2012. In September 2012, Nocenti became the writer of &quot;Catwoman&quot; with issue #0. She launched a &quot;Katana&quot; series the following February.

===Journalism and film===
In the 1990s, Nocenti began to focus on journalism and filmmaking. She edited &quot;High Times&quot; magazine for one year (2004) and was an editor on &quot;Prison Life Magazine&quot;. Her journalism has been published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;, &quot;Utne&quot;, &quot;Heeb&quot;, &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, &quot;Filmmaker&quot;, and &quot;Details&quot;. She has also done work for MoveOn.org.

Nocenti&#x27;s story &quot;The Most Expensive Road Trip in the World&quot; was collected in &quot;The Best American Travel Writing 2008&quot;, edited by Anthony Bourdain (Houghton Miifflin). She was an editor and writer for &quot;Stop Smiling&quot;, guest editing the &quot;Gambling Issue&quot;. As editor of the screenwriting magazine &quot;Scenario&quot;, Nocenti published the original versions of screenplays and interviewed directors and screenwriters.

Nocenti co-directed the documentary &quot;The Baluch&quot;, shot in Baluchistan, and made the short &quot;Creep&quot; for Glass Eye Pix.

In 2009, Nocenti taught screenplay writing at the Ciné Institute in Haiti and in 2012 wrote a series for HiLobrow about the country.

Nocenti made a short documentary film with Wendy Johnson called Disarming Falcons in 2014 which premiered at DOCNYC.

In 2016 she was one of the producers and writers on MAGIC CITY: The Art of the Street, for SC Exhibitions in Dresden, Germany. In 2018 she was an executive producer on MARVEL: Universe of Super-Heroes at MoPOP museum in Seattle, Washington. In 2018 she wrote &quot;The Seeds&quot; (with artist David Aja) and in 2019 she wrote &quot;Ruby Falls&quot; (with artist Flavia Biondi), both for Karen Berger&#x27;s new comic imprint Berger Books at Dark Horse Comics.

==Cameos and homages==
Nocenti appears on the photo cover of &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; #50, in costume as Tigra.

Nocenti appears in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #215 (Jan. 1982) as a secretary at an advertising agency that Steve Rogers visits looking for work.

Nocenti, along with John Byrne, Ron Wilson, Jim Shooter and Roger Stern are featured in &quot;The Thing&quot; # 7 (January 1983). The issue features the titular character storming into a fictionalized Marvel Comics and encountering the creators behind his own strip.

Nocenti makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #291 (January 1984). At the time Nocenti was assistant editor to Larry Hama on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. She also appeared in a spoof comic strip in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Defenders&quot; #127.

Arthur Adams visually based the character Ricochet Rita in the &quot;Longshot&quot; limited series on Nocenti.

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, a re-imagination of the X-Men in the alternate universe Ultimate Marvel imprint, the superhero Longshot has the civilian name Arthur Centino — his last name an anagram of &quot;Nocenti&quot; and his first name an homage to artist Arthur Adams, the original character&#x27;s co-creators.

==Personal life==
Nocenti lives in New York City.

<text>Arend d&#x27;Angremond Lijphart (born 17 August 1936) is a Dutch-American political scientist specializing in comparative politics, elections and voting systems, democratic institutions, and ethnicity and politics. He is Research Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. He is influential for his work on consociational democracy and his contribution to the new Institutionalism in political science.

==Biography==
Lijphart was born in Apeldoorn, Netherlands in 1936. During his youth, he experienced World War II and he attributed his aversion &quot;to violence&quot; and interest &quot;in questions of both peace and democracy&quot; to this experience.

He has a B.A. from Principia College in 1958 and a PhD in political science from Yale University in 1963. Lijphart taught at Elmira College (1961–63), the University of California, Berkeley (1963–68), at Leiden University (1968–78), and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) (1978–2000). He became a professor emeritus at UCSD in 2000.

Dutch by birth, he has spent most of his working life in the United States and became an American citizen. He has since regained his Dutch citizenship and is now a dual citizen of both the Netherlands and the United States.

==Awards and honors==

Over his career, Lijphart has received many awards and honors:

* 1984–85 Guggenheim fellow
* 1989 Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1995 to 1996 Served as President of the American Political Science Association. 
* In 1993 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.
* 1997 Awarded the prestigious Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science in 1997.
* 1998 Elected to the British Academy
* 2010 Received the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeritus Award

Lijphart has also received honorary doctorate from Leiden University (2001), Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (2004), and Ghent University (2009).

==Major works==
===Consociationalism and consensus democracy===
Lijphart is the leading authority on consociationalism, or the ways in which segmented societies manage to sustain democracy through power-sharing. Lijphart developed this concept in his first major work, &quot;The Politics of Accommodation: Pluralism and Democracy in the Netherlands&quot; (1968), a study of the Dutch political system, and further developed his arguments in &quot;Democracy in Plural Societies: A Comparative Exploration&quot; (1977).

In &quot;The Politics of Accommodation&quot; (1968), Lijphart challenges the influential pluralist theory and argues that the main factor in having a viable democracy in a strongly divided society is the spirit of accommodation among the elites of different groups.

In &quot;Democracy in Plural Societies&quot; (1977), Lijphart demonstrates that democracy can be achieved and maintained in countries with deep religious, ideological, linguistic, cultural, or ethnic cleavages if elites opt for a set of institutions that are distinctive of consociational democracy. In this book, Lijphart defines a consociational democracy in terms of four characteristics: (1) &quot;government by grand coalition of the political leaders of all significant segments of the plural society,&quot; (2) &quot;the mutual veto&quot;, (3) proportionality, and (4) &quot;a high degree of autonomy of each segment to run its own internal affairs.&quot; Lijphart&#x27;s work challenged the then influential view that democracy could only be stable in countries with a homogenous political culture.

Beginning with his book &quot;Democracies: Patterns of Majoritarian &amp; Consensus Government in Twenty-one Countries&quot; (1984), Lijphart focused on the broader contrast between majoritarian democracy and consensus democracy. While Lijphart advocated consociationalism primarily for societies deeply divided along ethnic, religious, ideological, or other cleavages, he sees consensus democracy as appropriate for any society with a consensual political culture. In contrast to majoritarian democracies, consensus democracies have multiparty systems, parliamentarism with oversized (and therefore inclusive) cabinet coalitions, proportional electoral systems, corporatist (hierarchical) interest group structures, federal structures, bicameralism, rigid constitutions protected by judicial review, and independent central banks. These institutions ensure, firstly, that only a broad supermajority can control policy and, secondly, that once a coalition takes power, its ability to infringe on minority rights is limited.

In &quot;Patterns of Democracy&quot; (1999, 2nd ed., 2012), Lijphart classifies thirty-six democracies using these attributes. He finds consensus democracies to be &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; states, having lower incarceration rates, less use of the death penalty, better care for the environment, more foreign aid work, and more welfare spending – qualities he feels &quot;should appeal to all democrats&quot;. He also finds that consensus democracies have a less abrasive political culture, more functional business-like proceedings, and a results-oriented ethic. The 2012 edition included data up to 2010 and found proportional representation (PR) was vastly superior for the &quot;quality of democracy&quot;, being statistically significantly better for 19 of 19 indicators. On the issue of &quot;effective government&quot; 16 out of 17 indicators pointed to PR as superior, with 9 out of 17 statistically significant. These results held up when controlling for the level of development and population size.

Peter Gourevitch and Gary Jacobson argue that Lijphart&#x27;s work on democracy make him &quot;the world&#x27;s leading theorist of democracy in sharply divided societies.&quot; Nils-Christian Bormann claims that &quot;Arend Lijphart&#x27;s typology of democratic systems has been one of the major contributions to comparative political science in the last decades.&quot; Gerardo L. Munck and Richard Snyder hold that &quot;Arend Lijphart is a leading empirical democratic theorist who reintroduced the study of political institutions into comparative politics in the wake of the behavioral revolution.&quot;

===Methodology===
Lijphart has also made influential contributions to methodological debates within comparative politics, most notably through his 1971 article &quot;Comparative Politics and the Comparative Method,&quot; published in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot;.

In this article Lijphart argues that the comparative method can be understood in contrast to the experimental and statistical methods and claims that the main difficulty facing the comparative method is that &quot;it must generalize on the basis of relatively few empirical cases.&quot; To solve this problem, Lijphart suggests four solutions:
* (1) &quot;increasing the number of cases as much as possible by means of longitudinal extension and a global range of analysis&quot; 
* (2) &quot;Reducing the property space of the analysis&quot;
* (3) &quot;Focusing the comparative analysis on &#x27;comparable&#x27; cases&quot;
* (4) &quot;Focusing on the key variables&quot;

Lijphart also discusses the case study method and identifies six types of case studies:
* (1) Atheoretical
* (2) Interpretative
* (3) Hypothesis-generating
* (4) Theory-confirming
* (5) Theory-infirming
* (6) Deviant case analyses

Lijphart work on methodology drew on ideas developed by Neil Smelser. It was also the point of departure for the work by David Collier on the comparative method.

<text>Graustark is a fictional country in Eastern Europe used as a setting for several novels by George Barr McCutcheon. Graustark&#x27;s neighbors, which also figure in the stories, are Axphain to the north and Dawsbergen to the south.

==Description==

Graustark is described as a mountainous country with an area of approximately - for reference, the unclaimed territory of Bir Tawil has an area of 795 square miles. There is at least one reference in the books that fixes its location as somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains near Romania. On the other hand, in &quot;Graustark&quot; it is said to be threatened with reduction to being only 25 miles wide by 150 miles long (3750 square miles) - for reference, the land area of Lebanon is equivalent to 3,950 square miles - and in &quot;Truxton King&quot; is said to provide a shorter rail route to Russian territories in or near Afghanistan. Graustark&#x27;s capital city, Edelweiss, is accessible by train from Vienna. The mountain town of Ganlook is near the border with Axphain, Graustark&#x27;s traditional enemy.

Graustark is ruled as a principality and its unit of currency is called the &quot;gavvo&quot;, worth $1.40 at the time of the novel &quot;Truxton King&quot;. Graustarkian is the native language of the people, although American English is universally spoken among the educated classes and is the everyday language of the royal family and court.

==Novels==
The Graustark novels are stories of court intrigue, royal disguise, and romance similar to Anthony Hope&#x27;s 1894 novel, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, and its sequels. They were popular best-sellers at the time they were published and the original editions are still readily available in used book shops. The two authors&#x27; novels gave their name to a fictional genre called either Ruritanian romance based on &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, or &quot;Graustarkian,&quot; from McCutcheon&#x27;s novels. This genre contains tales of romance and intrigue usually featuring titled characters in small, fictional, Central European or East European countries.

The novels in McCutcheon&#x27;s series are:

== History of Graustark ==

During the 1870s, Graustark&#x27;s ruler, Prince Ganlook of Graustark, was killed in a war with neighboring Axphain. As part of the ensuing peace treaty, Graustark agreed to pay a large indemnity to Axphain, to be due, with interest, in fifteen years.

Graustark found itself without the resources to pay the indemnity when it was due, and in desperation, Princess Yetive, Ganlook&#x27;s daughter and successor, was on the verge of contracting a state marriage to Prince Lorenz of Axphain in exchange for more favorable payment terms. But before the marriage could take place, Lorenz was murdered. The princess&#x27;s true love, the American Grenfall Lorry, whom she had met while travelling in the United States, appeared to be the murderer. Lorenz&#x27;s father insisted on the murderer&#x27;s punishment, but the execution was prevented by the revelation of the true murderer: the villainous Prince Gabriel, ruler of Dawsbergen, who was another of Yetive&#x27;s suitors. With Lorenz dead and Gabriel imprisoned, Yetive instead married her true love.

During Gabriel&#x27;s imprisonment, Dawsbergen was ruled by his younger half-brother, Prince Dantan, a popular figure among his own people and a staunch friend of Graustark as well. But after two years, Gabriel escaped from prison and, supported by the Dawsbergen army, returned to the throne. Dantan was forced to go into hiding in disguise in Graustark. For a time it appeared that Graustark might be forced into war with both Dawsbergen and Axphain, but this was averted when Gabriel was recaptured. Meanwhile, the disguised Prince Dantan had fallen in love with Beverly Calhoun, an American guest of the Lorrys; they were married upon his restoration to the throne of Dawsbergen.

Yetive and her husband were tragically killed in a railway accident near Brussels, leaving their young son Prince Robin as ruler of Graustark. While still a child, Robin was the target of an assassination plot by anarchists acting under the direction of the exiled Count Marlanx, whose ultimate goal was to establish himself as sole dictator of Graustark. But the assassination attempt was foiled by the intervention of the American Truxton King, and Marlanx was killed in the ensuing attack on the royal palace.

Graustark was still in financial difficulties by the time Prince Robin reached adulthood. William W. Blithers, a very rich and very vulgar American, offered to finance the country in the hopes of arranging a marriage between Robin and his own daughter. The two principals, however, had very different ideas of their own about marriage. Robin eventually married Bevra, the Crown Princess of Dawsbergen, daughter of Dantan and Beverly.

Graustark&#x27;s debts eventually ended up being held by Russia. In exchange for entering World War I as Russia&#x27;s ally, Graustark negotiated cancellation of this debt. Later, with Russia out of the war, Graustark also negotiated a separate peace. There followed a period of prosperity in the country.

Axphain, however, was taken over by communists after the war, and was in a state of much distress and unrest. Its ruler, Prince Hedrik (brother of Lorenz), and his elder son were murdered in the communist revolution, leaving the younger son Prince Hubert in exile in Graustark and an illegitimate son Gregory who lived with his mother in Italy. Hubert was hoping to marry Princess Virginia of Dawsbergen, Bevra&#x27;s younger sister, but she had previously contracted a marriage of convenience to Pendennis Yorke, an American journalist, and much to the surprise of everyone it became a genuine love match. The communist regime in Axphain was defeated after an unsuccessful attempt to invade Graustark, and the monarchy in that country was restored with Gregory on the throne rather than the unpopular Hubert, who was himself assassinated in the aftermath.

In the fantasy novel &quot;Three Hearts and Three Lions&quot; (1961) by Poul Anderson, the hero Holger Carlsen gives his hastily constructed alias as &#x27;Sir Rupert of Graustark.&#x27;

==On film==
* &quot;Graustark&quot; (1915)
* &quot;The Prince of Graustark&quot; was made as a film in 1916 at the Chicago Essanay Studios, and is of note because it is claimed that Colleen Moore has a quick, uncredited role as a maid in the background of one scene. Some historians, viewing the scene, are convinced the girl is Moore. Others have seen stills of the scene and do not see the resemblance at all. As such, this is not considered to be one of her film roles, though she did spend some summers in Chicago growing up, and could easily have been an extra in this film.

<text>The Arctic convoys of World War II were oceangoing convoys which sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the Soviet Union – primarily Arkhangelsk (Archangel) and Murmansk in Russia. There were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945, sailing via several seas of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, with periods with no sailings during several months in 1942, and in the summers of 1943 and 1944.

About 1,400 merchant ships delivered essential supplies to the Soviet Union under the Anglo-Soviet Agreement and US Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the U.S. Navy. Eighty-five merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships (two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships) were lost. Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; lost a number of vessels including one battleship, three destroyers, 30 U-boats, and many aircraft. The convoys demonstrated the Allies&#x27; commitment to helping the Soviet Union, prior to the opening of a second front, and tied up a substantial part of Germany&#x27;s naval and air forces.

== Background ==
During World War I (1914–1918), Central Powers blockades halted traffic between Imperial Russia and its Allies via the Black Sea and the Baltic. The Tsarist authorities sped up development of an ice-free port at Romanov-on-Murman (present-day Murmansk); however, supplies arriving via the Arctic came too little and too late to prevent the Allied collapse on the Eastern Front. But the operation of Murmansk proved and established the feasibility of an Arctic supply-line for military materiel.

In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the USSR. The following month, Britain and the Soviet Union formed an alliance, the Anglo-Soviet Agreement. Britain was quick to provide materiel aid to the USSR beginning in August – including tanks and aircraft – in order to try to keep her new ally in the war against the Axis powers. One major conduit for supplies was through Iran. The two nations began a joint occupation of Iran in late August, to neutralize German influence. The Soviet Union joined the Second Inter-Allied Conference in London in September. The USSR thereafter became one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; Allies of World War II along with Britain and, from December, the United States, fighting against the Axis Powers. The American Lend-Lease program was signed into law in March 1941. It provided Britain and the Soviet Union with limited war materiel beginning in October that year. The programme began to increase in scale during 1943. The British Commonwealth and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union reciprocated with a smaller Reverse Lend-Lease program.

==Convoy organisation==


After the first convoy, code-named Operation Dervish in August 1941, the Arctic convoys ran in two series:
* The first series, PQ (outbound) and QP (homebound), ran from September 1941 to September 1942. These convoys ran twice monthly, with interruptions in the summer of 1942, when the series was suspended after the disaster of Convoy PQ 17, and again in the autumn after the final convoy of the series, Convoy PQ 18, because of the long daylight hours and the preparations for November 1942&#x27;s Operation Torch.
* The second series of convoys, JW (outbound) and RA (homebound) ran from December 1942 until the end of the war, though with interruptions in the summer of 1943 and again in the summer of 1944.

The convoys ran from Iceland (usually off Hvalfjörður) and traveled north of Jan Mayen Island to Arkhangelsk when the ice permitted in the summer months, shifting south as the pack ice increased and terminating at Murmansk. From February 1942 they assembled and sailed from Loch Ewe in Scotland.

Outbound and homebound convoys were planned to run simultaneously; a close escort accompanied the merchant ships to port, remaining to make the subsequent return trip, whilst a covering force of heavy surface units was also provided to guard against sorties by ships such as &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. Escorts would accompany the outbound convoy to a cross-over point, meeting and then conducting the homebound convoy back, while the close escort finished the voyage with its charges.

The route skirted occupied Norway &quot;en route&quot; to the Soviet ports. Particular dangers included:
* the proximity of German air, submarine and surface forces
* the likelihood of severe weather
* the frequency of fog
* the strong currents and the mixing of cold and warm waters, which made ASDIC use difficult
* drift ice
* the alternation between the difficulties of navigating and maintaining convoy cohesion in constant darkness in winter convoys or being attacked around-the-clock in constant daylight in summer convoys

==Notable convoys==

* The &quot;Dervish&quot; convoy assembled at Hvalfjörður and sailed on 21 August 1941. It arrived at its destination, Archangel, ten days later. The convoy was relatively small and consisted of only six merchant ships: &quot;Lancastrian Prince&quot;, &quot;New Westminster City&quot;, &quot;Esneh&quot;, &quot;Trehata&quot;, the elderly &quot;Llanstephan Castle&quot;, the fleet oiler &quot;Aldersdale&quot; and the Dutch freighter &quot;Alchiba&quot;. The Commodore was Captain JCK Dowding RNR. The escorts comprised the ocean minesweepers HMS &quot;Halcyon&quot;, &quot;Salamander&quot; and &quot;Harrier&quot;, the destroyers HMS &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Active&quot; and &quot;Impulsive&quot; and the anti-submarine trawlers HMS &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Ophelia&quot;. As evidence of Churchill&#x27;s astute mastery of propaganda, on board &quot;Llanstephan Castle&quot; were two journalists and the artist Felix Topolski.
* On 30 May 1942, the surviving ships of Convoy PQ 16 arrived, most ships to Murmansk and eight to Archangel; the convoy was such a success in terms of the war stores delivered that the Germans made greater efforts to disrupt the following convoys. The crane ships from PQ 16 including &quot;SS Empire Elgar&quot; stayed at Archangel and Molotovsk (now Severodvinsk) unloading convoys for over 14 months.
* In July 1942, convoy PQ 17 suffered the worst losses of any convoy in the Second World War. Under attack from German aircraft and U-boats, the convoy was ordered to scatter, following reports that a battle group, which included the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, had sailed to intercept the convoy (although the German group did not leave port until the following day, and was subsequently ordered to return to port). Only 11 of the 35 merchant ships in the convoy succeeded in running the gauntlet of U-boats and German bombers. The novel &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot; (1955) by Alistair MacLean contains fictional events reminiscent of PQ 17 and other historical events.
* The Battle of the Barents Sea: In December 1942, German surface forces, including the heavy cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; and pocket battleship &quot;&quot;Lützow&quot;&quot;, sailed to intercept Convoy JW 51B. The German force was driven off by a combined force of destroyers and cruisers.
* In December 1943, Convoy JW 55B was the target of the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Two British warship forces were in the area. In the Battle of the North Cape, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; encountered British cruisers and was then sunk by and her escorts in a night action before it could return to port. German destroyers missed the convoy, which had been diverted north based on intelligence from the Norwegian resistance movement.

==Purpose and strategic impact==
Cargo included tanks, fighter planes, fuel, ammunition, raw materials, and food. The early convoys in particular delivered armoured vehicles and Hawker Hurricanes to make up for shortages in the Soviet Union. The Arctic convoys caused major changes to naval dispositions on both sides, which arguably had a major impact on the course of events in other theatres of war. As a result of early raids by destroyers on German coastal shipping and the Commando raid on Vågsøy, Hitler was led to believe that the British intended to invade Norway again. This, together with the obvious need to stop convoy supplies reaching the Soviet Union, caused him to direct that heavier ships, especially the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, be sent to Norway. The Channel Dash was partly undertaken for this reason.

As a &quot;fleet in being&quot;, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and the other German capital ships tied down British resources which might have been better used elsewhere, for example combating the Japanese in the Indian Ocean. The success of &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; in Operation Berlin during early 1941 had demonstrated the potential German threat. As the Allies closed the air gap over the North Atlantic with very long range aircraft, Huff-Duff (radio triangulation equipment) improved, airborne centimetric radar was introduced and convoys received escort carrier protection, the scope for commerce raiding diminished.

Aside from an abortive attempt to interdict PQ12 in March 1942 and a raid on Spitsbergen in September 1943, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; spent most of the Second World War in Norwegian fjords. She was penned in and repeatedly attacked until she was finally sunk in Tromsø fjord on 12 November 1944 by the Royal Air Force (RAF). Other Kriegsmarine capital ships either never got to Norway (e.g. &quot;Gneisenau&quot;), were chased off, or were sunk by superior forces (e.g. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;). In particular, the unsuccessful attack on convoy JW-51B (the Battle of the Barents Sea), where a strong German naval force failed to defeat a British escort of cruisers and destroyers, infuriated Hitler and led to the strategic change from surface raiders to submarines. Some capital ships were physically dismantled and armament used in coastal defences.
Leningrad under the siege was one of important destinations for supplies from the convoys. From 1941 food and munition supplies were delivered from British convoys to Leningrad by trains, barges, and trucks. Supplies were often destroyed by the Nazi air-bombings, and by Naval Detachment K while on the way to Leningrad. However, convoys continued deliveries of food in 1942, 1943, and through 1944. Towards the end of the war the material significance of the supplies was probably not as great as the symbolic value hence the continuation—at Stalin&#x27;s insistence—of these convoys long after the Soviets had turned the German land offensive.

It has been said that the main value of the convoys was political, proving that the Allies were committed to helping the Soviet Union at a time when they were unable to open a second front.

==British intelligence==
Ultra signals intelligence gained from the German Enigma code being broken at Bletchley Park played an important part in the eventual success of the convoys. German documents related to the Enigma coding machine were captured during the commando raids of Operation Archery and Operation Anklet (27 December 1941). The documents enabled the British to read messages on the home waters naval Enigma used by surface ships and U-boats in the Arctic (&quot;Heimisch&quot;, later &quot;Hydra&quot; network; Dolphin to the British) for the rest of the war. In January 1942 reinforcements of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers, torpedo-bombers and long range reconnaissance aircraft were sent to northern Norway and new command organisations established at Stavanger and Kirkenes, followed by &quot;Fliegerführer Lofoten&quot; who was charged with the defence of Norway and offensive operations against Allied convoys. The three U-boats in the area were increased to nine and another six were distributed between Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik to reconnoitre and oppose Allied landings. In May, all the U-boats came under Arctic Command and on 23 May, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; joined &quot;Tirpitz&quot; at Trondheim, followed by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;; by 26 May &quot;Lützow&quot; had arrived at Narvik.

The British read these moves from Ultra intercepts and traffic analysis from the RAF Y-station at RAF Cheadle, which eavesdropped on communications between &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft and ground stations. The reinforcement of the U-boat force in the Arctic to 12 in March and 21 in August (the real number was later found to be 23) was followed, along with the transfer orders to the large German ships, leading to the ambush of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; by the submarine off Trondheim on 23 February. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was badly damaged by a torpedo and the Admiralty was informed of the hit by an Enigma intercept the next day. The information could not always be acted upon because much of it was obtained at short notice but the intelligence did allow the Royal Navy to prepare for battle and convoys could be given appropriate escorting forces. The interception and sinking of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; by was greatly assisted by ULTRA intercepts.

==Literary depictions==

The 1955 novel &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot; by Scottish writer Alistair MacLean, and the 1967 novel &quot;The Captain&quot; by Dutch author Jan de Hartog, are set during the Arctic convoys. The two books differ in style, characterisation and philosophy (de Hartog was a pacifist, which cannot be said about MacLean). Both convey vividly the atmosphere of combined extreme belligerent action and inhospitable nature, pushing protagonists to the edge of endurance and beyond. 

The 1958 novel &quot;The Midnight Sun&quot; by Ian Cameron (pseudonym of Donald G. Payne, who was a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm pilot during the convoys) is set during an Arctic Convoy on the fictitious escort carrier HMS &quot;Viper&quot; in late 1944.

The 1967 Norwegian historic account &quot;One in Ten Had to Die&quot; () by Per Hansson is based on the experience of the Norwegian sailor Leif Heimstad and other members of the Norwegian merchant fleet during World War II. The 1973 Russian novel &quot;Requiem for Convoy PQ-17&quot; () by Valentin Pikul depicts the mission of Convoy PQ 17, reflecting the bravery and courage of ordinary sailors in the merchant ships and their escorts, who took mortal risks to provide Allied aid.

==Other supply convoys==
The Arctic route was the shortest and most direct route for lend-lease aid to the USSR, though it was also the most dangerous. Some 3,964,000 tons of goods were shipped by the Arctic route; 7 percent was lost, while 93 percent arrived safely. This constituted some 23 percent of the total aid to the USSR during the war. The Persian Corridor was the longest route (and the only all-weather route) to the USSR, but was not fully operational until mid-1942. Thereafter it saw the passage of 4,160,000 tons of goods, 27 percent of the total. The Pacific Route opened in late summer 1941, but was affected by the start of hostilities between Japan and the US with the Attack on Pearl Harbor. After December 1941, only Soviet ships could be used and as Japan and the USSR observed a strict neutrality towards each other, only non-military goods could be transported. Nevertheless, 8,244,000 tons of goods went by this route, 50 percent of the total.

A branch of the Pacific Route began carrying goods through the Bering Strait to the Soviet Arctic coast in June 1942. From July through September small Soviet convoys assembled in Providence Bay, Siberia to be escorted north through the Bering Strait and west along the Northern Sea Route by icebreakers and Lend-Lease s. A total of 452,393 tons passed through the Bering Strait aboard 120 ships. Part of this northern tonnage was fuel for the airfields along the Alaska-Siberia Air Route. Provisions for the airfields were transferred to river vessels and barges on the estuaries of large Siberian rivers. Remaining ships continued westbound and were the only seaborne cargoes to reach Archangel while J W convoys were suspended through the summers of 1943 and 1944.

==Memorials==

The town of Poolewe on the northwest coast of Scotland was an important port in this route. Today there are several plaques commemorating this work. The Loch Ewe Brewing Company commemorates the Arctic Convoys by a special brand beer named &quot;Arctic Convoy IPA&quot;.

<text>Aarburg is a historic town and a municipality in the district of Zofingen in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

The small town lies in the southwest Aargau, in a narrow section of the Aare valley, at the confluence with the Wigger. It lies in the intersection of the most important traffic routes of Switzerland. The dominant landmark is the Aarburg Castle, one of Switzerland&#x27;s largest castles and a heritage site of national significance. The visual character of Aarburg is shaped by the fortification and the church on a rock spur.

The official language of Aarburg is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==

In Roman times a road went by Aarburg, connecting the Olten region with the rest of inner Switzerland. During the construction of a factory in the 20th century, a hoard of coins produced during the reign of Emperor Tetricus I was discovered. The coin hoard was probably buried during the Bagauden Invasions in 284 CE.

When, precisely, the fortress of Aarburg was constructed on the rocky outcropping is unknown. The first time it was documented was in 1123 when it is mentioned as &quot;Areburc&quot;. At the time it was the property of the Grafen von Frohburg family. From this castle the Bailiwick of Aarburg was governed, what is today the western part of the county of Zofingen, though not the town of Zofingen itself. In 1299 the Frohburgs sold the castle and the Bailiwick of Aarburg to the Habsburg family. The settlement at the foot of the castle was clearly identified as a town in the year 1330. Archeological evidence has shown that the town was probably founded around the year 1312.

Wedged between the cities of Olten and Zofingen, with only four kilometers between them, Aarburg could not develop commercially and remained a small town. The people of Aarburg lived mainly on the tariff revenues that commerce along the Gotthard Pass provided. A small harbor on the river Aare was constructed in 1361. The resulting river boat traffic was of great economic importance until the 16th and 17th centuries.

After a short siege the town was captured by Bern on 14 April 1415. In 1416, the castle became the residence of the bailiff of the Bailiwick of Aarburg. Under control of Bern, the castle was expanded into a fortress in the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to protect the alliance between the Reformed cities of Bern and Zurich from attack by their Catholic neighbors.

On 4 May 1798 the town and fortress were captured by France without a struggle. The district of Aarburg was dissolved and the regional administrative functions of the French imposed Helvetic Republic were moved to Zofingen. The newly established Canton of Aargau took over the fortress in 1804, initially using it as a jail and prison. Since 1893 the castle has housed a canton-run school.

A huge fire destroyed much of the premises and the church on 4 May 1840, leaving 68 families homeless. The village was rebuilt, though without the main fortifications. On the rock spur, near the castle, a church was raised up between 1842 and 1845 in the new gothic style.

The first textile factory was opened in 1824. The railway station was opened in on 9 July 1856 along the Aarau – Olten – Zofingen – Emmenbrücke line; on 16 March 1857, the Herzogenbuchsee line was opened, later extended to Bern. Aarburg thereby became a privileged industrial town. In the second half of the 20th century the township&#x27;s population doubled due to the construction of the autobahn nearby.

<text>Namby-pamby is a term for affected, weak, and maudlin speech/verse. It originates from the poem Namby Pamby (1725) by Henry Carey.

Carey wrote his poem as a satire of Ambrose Philips and published it in his &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;. Its first publication was &quot;Namby Pamby: or, a panegyrick on the new versification address&#x27;d to A----- P----&quot;, where the A-- P-- implicated Ambrose Philips. Philips had written a series of odes in a new prosody of seven-syllable catalectic trochaic tetrameter and dedicated it to &quot;all ages and characters, from Walpole &quot;steerer of the realm&quot;, to Miss Pulteney in the nursery.&quot; Though once used by Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, this 3.5&#x27; line became a matter of consternation for more conservative poets, and a matter of mirth for Carey. Carey adopts Philips&#x27;s choppy line-form for his parody and latches onto the dedication to nurseries to create an apparent nursery rhyme that is, in fact, a grand bit of nonsense and satire mixed.

Philips was a figure who had become politically active and was a darling of the Whig party. He was also a target of the Tory satirists. Alexander Pope had criticized Philips repeatedly (in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and in his &quot;Peri Bathos&quot;, among other places), and praising or condemning Philips was a political as much as poetic matter in the 1720s, with the nickname also employed by John Gay and Jonathan Swift.

The poem begins with a mock-epic opening (as had Pope&#x27;s &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot; and as had Dryden&#x27;s &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;), calling all the muses to witness the glory of Philips&#x27;s prosodic reform:

:&quot;All ye Poets of the Age!
:All ye Witlings of the Stage!
:Learn your Jingles to reform!
:Crop your Numbers and Conform:
:Let your little Verses flow
:Gently, Sweetly, Row by Row:
:Let the Verse the Subject fit;
:Little Subject, Little Wit.
:Namby-Pamby is your Guide;
:Albion&#x27;s Joy, Hibernia&#x27;s Pride.&quot;

Carey&#x27;s &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; had enormous success. It became so successful that people began to call Philips himself &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; (as, for example, in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; in 1727), as he had been renamed by the poem, and Carey was referred to as &quot;Namby Pamby Carey&quot;. The poem sold well and he used this style in various other short poems.

<text>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC; ) is a Chinese partially state-owned multinational banking and financial services corporation headquartered in Beijing, China. It is the largest of the &quot;big four&quot; banks in China, and the largest bank in the world by total assets. ICBC was created on from what were then the commercial banking operations of the People&#x27;s Bank of China. ICBC is majority-owned by the Chinese government and has remained so after its landmark initial public offering in 2006. As end of 2021, ICBC shareholders included Central Huijin Investment (34.7 percent), the Chinese Ministry of Finance (31.1 percent), the National Council for Social Security Fund (3.5 percent), adding up to 69.3 percent under the ultimate control of the Ministry of Finance.

ICBC became the world&#x27;s largest bank by total assets in 2012 (based on year-end balance sheet) and has kept this rank ever since. It was ranked first on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world&#x27;s top public companies in 2015. On , it was the third-largest bank in the world by market capitalization at $211 billion.

Several former employees of ICBC have moved on to work in prominent government positions in China. Notable ICBC alumni include China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Yi Huiman and People&#x27;s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng.

==History==

===Background===
Following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, China adopted a so-called monobank system in which all financial operations were operated by the People&#x27;s Bank of China (PBC). In 1978-1979, the Chinese authorities initiated banking reform, whose effect was to transform the PBC into a proper central bank while specialized commercial banks were formed under its watch. This resulted in the gradual establishment of a two-tier banking system.

===1984–2006===
By rights of a contradiction within the economic functioning of the government of China, the People&#x27;s Republic, the State Council of China, during September 1983 made a decision to separate certain activities of the government to an exclusively operating organisation, subsequently named the Industrial and Commercial bank of China, established on 1 January 1984. ICBC was then the fourth of the four specialist banks of 1978–1979 to be made, from the taking of control of commercial activities (&quot;industrial credit and savings business&quot;) from People&#x27;s Bank of China so that the latter might be transformed to a newly made central bank. ICBC focused on the intermediation of deposits.

ICBC opened its first overseas branch in Singapore in 1993. It opened a branch in Luxembourg in 1999, which became its European headquarters in 2011. In 2000, ICBC acquired the Union Bank of Hong Kong and renamed it ICBC (Asia). A Hong Kong-listed entity, ICBC (Asia) then purchased the Hong Kong subsidiary of Fortis Bank, originally the Hong Kong branch of the Banque Belge pour l&#x27;Étranger, and rebranded it under its own name on 10 October 2005.

In June 2005, ICBC established ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management as a China joint venture with Credit Suisse First Boston and COSCO, with the three partners respectively holding 55, 25, and 20 percent of the venture&#x27;s equity. Subsequently, ICBC bought out COSCO&#x27;s stake and acquired an additional 5 percent from Credit Suisse.

As of 2006, ICBC had 2.5 million corporate customers and 150 million individual customers.

===Initial public offering===

In the runup to its planned initial public offering, on 28 April 2006, three &quot;strategic investors&quot; injected US$3.7 billion into ICBC:
* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6 billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.
* Dresdner Bank invested US$1 billion.
* American Express invested US$200 million.

ICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006. It was the world&#x27;s largest initial public offering at that time valued at US$21.9 billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4 billion IPO by Japan&#x27;s NTT DoCoMo in 1998. In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC&#x27;s IPO record when it raised $22.1 billion. China&#x27;s largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.

ICBC raised at least US$14 billion in Hong Kong (H-shares) and another US$5.1 billion in Shanghai (A-shares). Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC&#x27;s take rose to US$21.9 billion (17% of ICBC&#x27;s market value before the IPO), divided in US$16 billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9 billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.

At the end of its first day of trading, the bank&#x27;s shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to Bloomberg, ICBC&#x27;s market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3 billion, making its equity the world&#x27;s fifth highest among banks, just behind JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, ICBC&#x27;s Shanghai-listed A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.

===Later developments===

In July 2007, ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.

In August 2008, ICBC became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain US federal approval to establish a branch in New York City.

By October 2020, Donald Trump received $5.4 million from ICBC via the Trump Tower lease.

In June 2009, ICBC spent 80.25 million Canadian dollars (US$58.53 million) to acquire a 70% stake in the Bank of East Asia (BEA). By the end of 2009, the number of credit cards issued exceeded 52 million, a 33% increase equivalent to nearly 13 million cards compared to the previous year.

On 18 August 2011, ICBC passed the examination from State Bank of Pakistan and started its business in Pakistan.

During November 2012, ICBC acquired from Standard Bank a 80% stake (valued at $600 million) of the former subsidiary of BankBoston in Argentina, which Standard Bank had purchased in 2006. This was the largest operation of a Chinese bank in Latin America. In Argentina, the bank has ~1,000,000 individual customers, ~30,000 companies of all categories and more than 1600 corporate companies.

During the 2013 Korean crisis, ICBC halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang&#x27;s missile and nuclear programs.

It was announced at the end of July 2013 that South Africa&#x27;s Standard Bank was in talks to sell its markets business in London to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for more than $500 million. The transaction was completed on , after which the London-based operation has been known as ICBC Standard Bank.

In 2014, ICBC was the largest company in the world according to the Forbes Global 2000 list, with revenue reaching 148.7 billion USD and profit amounting to 42.7 billion USD. On 24 September 2014, ICBC Kuwait Branch officially opened in Kuwait City as the first and currently the only Chinese bank in Kuwait. Meanwhile, it is also the fourth branch of ICBC in the Middle East, following branches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha. On 25 May 2015, the Company further strengthened its presence in the Middle East and Europe by purchasing Turkey&#x27;s TekstilBank and forming its ICBC Turkey subsidiary.

ICBC Financial Services, the bank&#x27;s brokerage unit, provided about $88 billion of repo financing at the end of 2015, up from $59 billion two years ago, according to regulatory filings.

In November 2023, the bank was subject to a ransomware attack, preventing certain trades from clearing. The attack was against the US unit of ICBC, which at the time was considered the world&#x27;s largest lender by assets, as reported by &quot;Bloomberg&quot;. The bank was hacked by LockBit, a ransomware group. described by &quot;Bloomberg&quot; as &quot;a criminal gang with ties to Russia.&quot; The attack against ICBC resulted in the bank being unable to clear a large number of US Treasury trades over the next day and forced others to reroute orders, upsetting normal operations. Lockbit ultimately claimed that the bank paid the ransom, a statement which Reuters was unable to verify.
