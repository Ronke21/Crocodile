<text>is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) reserved for the designation Svalbard and Jan Mayen. The domain name registry is Norid, but is not open for registration. The issuing of the domain was based on the ISO 3166 designation of Svalbard and Jan Mayen, which consists of two separately administrated integrated territories of Norway: the Arctic archipelago Svalbard and the nearly uninhabited volcanic island Jan Mayen. was designated on 21 August 1997, at the same time as Bouvet Island was allocated . Both were placed under the registry Norid, which is also the sponsor. Norwegian policy states that is sufficient for those institutions connected to both Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and therefore the domain is not open to registration. It is Norwegian policy not to commercialize domain resources, so there are no plans to sell . Should the domain later come into use, it will be under regulation of the Norwegian Communications Authority and follow the same policy as . There are two second-level domains reserved for the two areas: and , but other web addresses are also used.

==History==
Svalbard and Jan Mayen are two integrated territories of Norway with special status (unincorporated area). The Svalbard Treaty grants Norway full sovereignty of Svalbard, but the archipelago holds special status as among other things a free economic zone and is not part of the European Economic Area and the Schengen Area. Jan Mayen is a nearly unpopulated volcanic island in the Atlantic Ocean and is a fully integrated part of Norway. During the establishment of the ISO 3166 codes, it was proposed that Svalbard have its own code, but the Norwegian authorities chose to also include Jan Mayen in the area, partly because Jan Mayen was administered by the Governor of Svalbard until 1994. Following the ISO codes, was allocated on 21 August 1997, at the same time was allocated.

In June 2015, Norwegian computer scientist Håkon Wium Lie and the Socialist Left Party proposed using the domain, along with , as online free havens. The proposal aims at protecting both the Norwegian authorities and foreign dissidents from surveillance.

==Policy==
Management of lies with the Trondheim-based Norid, which is also the domain name registry for and the unused . Norid is a limited company owned by Uninett, which is again owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. The legal right to manage the domains is two-fold, based both on an agreement with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and regulations under the &quot;Telecommunication Act&quot; which is supervised by the Lillesand-based Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority.

The policy for use of is regulated by the &quot;Regulation Concerning Domain Names Under Norwegian Country Code Top-level Domains&quot;, also known as the &quot;Domain Regulation&quot;. This regulation also regulates Norway&#x27;s other two ccTLDs, and . Should later come unto use, the same rules and procedures currently regarding would be used for . The domain remains reserved for potential future use. Sale of the two unused ccTLDs has not been an item to consider for policymakers, as commercialization of the domain resources is in direct contradiction to Norwegian policy.

<text>The Minnesota Iceman is a sideshow exhibit and elaborate hoax that depicts a fake man-like creature frozen in a block of ice. It was displayed at shopping malls, state fairs, and carnivals in the United States and Canada in the 1960s and early 1970s and promoted as the &quot;missing link&quot; between Modern man and Neanderthals. It was sold on eBay in 2013 and put on display in Austin, Texas.

==Description==

The creature has been described as male, human-like, 6 ft (~1.8 m) tall, hairy, with large hands and feet, very dark brown hair about 3 - 4 inches (~9 cm) long, and a flattened nose. One of its arms appeared to be broken and one of its eyes appeared to have been knocked out of its socket, allegedly by a bullet that was said to have entered the creature&#x27;s head from behind. After investigating, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution determined that it was likely to be a hoax.

==History==
Promoter and exhibitor Frank Hansen stated the Minnesota Iceman was discovered in the region of Siberia and that he was acting as its caretaker for an absentee owner he described as an &quot;eccentric California millionaire&quot;. Touring carnivals and fairs with the exhibit, Hansen was once reportedly detained by Canada Customs officials, who were concerned he was transporting a human cadaver.

The FBI was informed that the subject might potentially be a human murder victim, but the agency did not investigate, possibly due to many believing it was a hoax.

Sanderson, then science editor for &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine, authored an article about the Iceman in the April 1969 issue that featured the headline, &quot;Is this the missing link between man and the apes?&quot; Sanderson also spoke about the Iceman in television appearances, and contacted primatologist John Napier, asking him to investigate it under the official auspices of Smithsonian Institution. Hansen subsequently withdrew the Minnesota Iceman from public inspection, saying the withdrawal was on orders from its California-based owner. Hansen later provided a new &quot;Iceman&quot; for exhibit, described by observers as a latex model that was clearly different from the original.

Napier, in conjunction with the Smithsonian, made preliminary investigations of Hansen&#x27;s affairs and said he found that Hansen had commissioned the creation of the Iceman from a West Coast company in 1967, leading Napier to quickly conclude there was only ever one Iceman latex model that he theorized was repositioned and refrozen between appearances. Napier stated that &quot;The Smithsonian Institution…is satisfied that the creature is simply a carnival exhibit made of latex rubber and hair...the &#x27;original&#x27; model and the present so-called &#x27;substitute&#x27; are one and the same.&quot;

== 2013 sale ==
In February 2013, the Minnesota Iceman was reportedly auctioned on eBay. The listing read: &quot;This is the actual sideshow gaff billed as &#x27;The Minnesota Iceman&#x27; by Frank Hansen in the 1960s. This is a one of a kind hoax that was fabricated by a mid-20th century showman.&quot; It was purchased by Austin, Texas, &quot;Museum of the Weird&quot; owner Steve Busti, who has placed it on public display.

== Popular culture ==
The Minnesota Iceman was featured on season 4 episode 6 of the A&amp;E series &quot;Shipping Wars&quot; as well as season 12 episode 26 of the Travel Channel series Mysteries at the Museum. The story of the iceman was also featured in the 7th-season premiere of the television show Unsolved Mysteries. In &quot;Rock Apes of Vietnam&quot; (Series 1 Episode 9 of the 2019 TV series &quot;In Search of Monsters&quot;) the exhibit&#x27;s current owner Steve Busti and others say that Hansen changed his story about the exhibit&#x27;s origin 3 times, and that the current exhibit may be a latex replica intended to protect Hansen from legal problems if he killed and illegally imported a &quot;Rock Ape&quot; (an alleged rock-throwing Vietnamese cryptid similar to America&#x27;s Bigfoot) from Vietnam when he was a military pilot during the Vietnam War.

<text>.im is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Isle of Man. It is administered by the Government of the Isle of Man and managed on a day-to-day basis by Domicilium, an offshore Internet Service Provider based on the Isle of Man.

On July 1, 2006, .im registration was made available to anyone in the world, including one, two, and three letter domains directly under .im, which opens up the possibility of .im domain hacks. The domain has gained popularity among companies who produce instant messaging (IM) software with names registered by Adium, ejabberd, Coccinella, Gitter, Meebo, Pandion, Pidgin, Prosody, Trillian, and Yahoo! among others. It is also used by the website elgooG. .IM is also used in German-, French- and Italian-speaking countries (i.e. Germany, Austria, Luxemburg, Switzerland, France, Italy and part of Belgium) for Real Estate purposes (Immobilien in German, Immobilier in French, Immobiliare in Italian). The abundance of available short names has also made the domain popular for personal use.

Currently, domain registrations cost £40.00 per year for domains of three letters or more, although they can be purchased much more cheaply through resellers. Premium domains with two character names are available for £495.00, and premium domains with one character names are available for £995.00.

<text>.cs was for several years the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Czechoslovakia. However, the country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, and the two new countries were soon assigned their own ccTLDs: .cz and .sk respectively. The use of .cs was gradually phased out, and the ccTLD was deleted some time around January 1995.

.cs domain first appeared in Internet Assigned Numbers Authority tables in autumn 1990 and in June 1991 in RIPE list. In October 1991 first domain was registered (iac.cs - Institute of Applied Cybernetics in Bratislava), in February 1992 first hosts existed. As of December 1992 40 domains were registered, while maximum number of 114 registered domains was reached in November 1993 and February 1994.

Until the deletion of .yu in 2010, .cs was the most heavily used top-level domain ever to be deleted. Statistics from the RIPE Network Coordination Centre show that even in June 1994, after much of the conversion to .cz and .sk had been done, .cs still had over 2,300 hosts. By comparison, other deleted TLDs (.nato and .zr) may never have reached 10 hosts.

In July 2003, CS became the ISO 3166-1 code for Serbia and Montenegro (&quot;Srbija i Crna Gora&quot; in Serbian), and remained so until 2006, when the country split and the codes for domains .rs and .me were created. However, Serbia and Montenegro did not use .cs as its ccTLD, but continued instead to use the Yugoslavian ccTLD .yu until it finally expired on 30 March 2010.

<text>On the Ten Major Relationships () is a speech by Mao Zedong which outlines how the People&#x27;s Republic of China would construct socialism different from the model of development undertaken by the Soviet Union. It was delivered by Mao during an enlarged session of a Politburo meeting of the Chinese Communist Party on April 25, 1956, and further elaborated in the 7th Supreme State Conference on May 2 the same year.

In official account, the speech is celebrated as the landmark of the search for an alternative mode of socialist development that fit the specific conditions in China and it also marks the beginning of Mao&#x27;s denouncement of the Soviet Union in the late 1950s. In fewer than 13,000 words in Chinese (10,000 in English translation), Mao stressed that China had to avoid repeating &quot;certain defects and errors that occurred in the course of their [the Soviet Union] building socialism.&quot; Covered in the speech are the economic, social, political, and ethnical aspects of building socialism in China. Mao further charted a strategy of forming alliance and splitting enemies in international sphere.

The speech was made in front of the party secretaries of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and was subsequently circulated among the middle and top cadres for political study. It was not published until after Mao&#x27;s death in September 1976.

== Background ==
In January 1956 Mao Zedong noticed that Liu Shaoqi was receiving reports from some committees of the State Council and became interested in those reports. Beginning from late last year, Liu was preparing for the political report for the forthcoming party congress and Mao then instructed to arrange different bureaus to report to him. As Mao said, the formulation of the ten major relationships was the result of communicating with the cadres in those bureaus.

From February 14 to April 24 (1956), Mao listened to the reports from 34 different bureaus, plus the report from the State Planning Commission on the Second Five-year Plan. During those 41 days, Mao listened to reports for four to five hours every day in Zhongnanhai. Other top leaders including Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Chen Yun, and Deng Xiaoping had also participated in these meetings and expressed their opinions. The reporting began with heavy industry, then proceeded to light industry, handicraft industry, transportation and telecommunication, agriculture and forestry, finance, and other areas. During the same period, Mao was also involved in the drafting of another document titled On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat (), which, published on April 5 on the People&#x27;s Daily, was an immediate response of the Chinese Communist Party to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After listening to the first round of reports, from April 12 to 17 Mao visited an exhibition of mechanics to see the latest development in the industry. Then from April 18 onwards, Li Fuchun reported to Mao on the Second Five-year Plan. The entire process was Mao&#x27;s longest and most comprehensive investigation on economic affairs after 1949. In the enlarged Politburo meeting from April 25 to 28, Mao made the speech on its first day. As the original agenda was about issues like agricultural cooperative, attendants did not expect Mao to make such a speech on the ten major relationships and it became the focus for the rest of the meeting.

=== Domestic sphere ===
After the founding of the new country in 1949, the party had consolidated its control over Chinese society through mass campaigns like Land Reform (1947–1952), the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries (1950–1953), the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns (1951–1952), the Campaign to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950–1953), and the Sufan Movement (1955). The government also completed the Ethnic Classification in 1954 which aimed at sorting and categorizing the hundreds of distinct ethnic communities within the country, the result of which served as the basis for future policy on nationalities.

In terms of economic development, China had followed the Soviet model of socialism ever since Mao&#x27;s decision to lean on the side of the Soviet Union. As his speech On the People&#x27;s Democratic Dictatorship () in June 1949 states,&quot;We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who they are. We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully and conscientiously. We must not pretend to know when we do not know. We must not put on bureaucratic airs. If we dig into a subject for several months, for a year or two, for three or five years, we shall eventually master it. At first some of the Soviet Communists also were not very good at handling economic matters and the imperialists awaited their failure too. But the Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged victorious and, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, it learned not only how to make the revolution but also how to carry on construction. It has built a great and splendid socialist state. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher and we must learn from it. The situation both at home and abroad is in our favour, we can rely fully on the weapon of the people&#x27;s democratic dictatorship, unite the people throughout the country, the reactionaries excepted, and advance steadily to our goal.&quot;Following Mao&#x27;s visit to Moscow from late 1949 to early 1950, on February 14, 1950, the two countries signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance () which promised the Soviet Union&#x27;s commitment to help build socialism in the newly founded People&#x27;s Republic of China. From 1950 to 1956, a total of 5,092 Soviet experts were sent to China for technical assistant and the total number of visits of the Soviet experts was over 18,000 throughout the years. The areas they provided assistance included government bureaus, military, large enterprises, and higher institutions. In the countryside, from late 1955 to early 1956, China&#x27;s agricultural sector completed the Socialist High Tide, transforming from having only 14.2% (16.9 million out of 120 million) of peasant families collectivized to 91.2% of them joining the co-operatives and 61.9% joining collectives. Likewise in the cities, private factories and shops were either turned into cooperatives or nationalized in the name of joint public-private ownership.

=== International sphere ===
Regarding to the Soviet Union&#x27;s leadership in the socialist camp, the Tito-Stalin Split broke out in 1948, followed by the Informbiro period that ended at 1955, signaling the end of the Soviet Union&#x27;s intolerance of alternative socialist development. In Moscow, a dramatic event happened during the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956, as Nikita Khrushchev made the &quot;Secret Speech&quot; of denouncing the personality cult and dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. Chinese Communist Zhu De and Deng Xiaoping attended the congress and were surprised by the length that Khrushchev went into denouncing Stalin. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had begun to implement its 6th Five-year Plan for 1956–1960. On the geopolitical scene, China had since 1954 began to foster relations with her Asian neighboring countries like India and Burma. In April 1955, the Bandung Conference was held in Bandung, Indonesia and Zhou Enlai attended the conference as the representative of Communist China, strengthening her role in the African and Asian continents.

== Content ==
Mao Zedong summarized the issues related to socialist construction and transformation into ten major relationships. To avoid the mistakes that the Soviet Union had made, Mao urged to mobilize the &quot;positive elements&quot; of the country, which were the peasants and workers, and turned the &quot;negative elements&quot; of reactionaries as far as possible into positive. Internationally &quot;forces that can be united&quot; were positive whilst reactionary forces were negative. The following are the synopses of the ten relationships, many of which were Mao&#x27;s urge for balanced development and open criticism of the situations in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

=== Relationship between heavy industry on one hand and light industry and agriculture on the other ===
Mao was concerned about the speed of capital accumulation and the production of the means of production. He was of the opinion that China was on the right course of balancing heavy industry on one hand, and light industry and agriculture on the other. Unlike in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, where the disequilibrium resulted in &quot;a shortage of goods on the market and an unstable currency&quot;, the supply of grain, raw materials, and daily necessities were stable in China. He urged to increase the investment in agriculture and light industry so that the accumulation of capital could be enhanced for the development of heavy industry.

=== Relationship between industry in the coastal regions and industry in the interior ===
The focus of this part is the balance between the development in the coastal regions and interior regions, which Mao considered free from major mistakes. Yet he urged to give greater attention to development in coastal regions, because the military threat posed by the United States had subsided and it would be unwise to abandon the coastal regions. He also mentioned in the interior regions industry should be gradually built.

=== Relationship between economic construction and defense construction ===
Similar to last part, Mao suggested that the threat posed by the United States since the Korean War had subsided and the Chinese armed forces had grown. Though China did not yet have the atom bomb, they would be able to possess it soon. Hence he urged lowering military and administrative expenses in favor of economic construction, which would eventually lead to investment in defense construction.

=== Relationship between the state, the units of production, and the producers ===
As for the relationship between the state and society, Mao urged for more openness and delegation of powers to the individual units of production and producers. Workers should be given improved working conditions and welfare, and increased and more equal wages as a reward for their political consciousness and over-fulfillment of production quotas. Factories should also been given more autonomy in operation. Unlike in the Soviet Union where peasants were exploited heavily by the state, China had a good relation with the peasants, though the Chinese Communist Party made a huge purchase of grain despite the floods in 1954 which made the peasants disgruntled. The policies of low agricultural tax, purchasing agricultural productions at standard prices, and subsidizing the grain sale to grain-deficient areas prevented China from making the mistakes the Soviet Union had made.

=== Relationship between the central and the local authorities ===
Mao stated that because of the complex situation of China&#x27;s large population and vast scale, it was better to have both strong central and strong local governments than only a strong central government (as Mao described the Soviet Union). Mao stated that China should not be like the USSR, which Mao described as having a central government that was not flexible enough for local governments to operate. Though the incidents of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi in 1953 reminded the danger of local leaders having too much power, &quot;provided that the policies of the central authorities are not violated, the local authorities may work out rules, regulations and measures in the light of their specific conditions and the needs of their work, and this is in no way prohibited by the Constitution.&quot;

=== Relationship between the Han nationality and the minority nationalities ===
Mao said that the party had been able to oppose Han chauvinism and foster a harmonious relation with ethnic minorities. The situation in China was that Han population was the majority, but they occupied relatively a lower portion of land and the ethnic minorities occupied the majority of the land. The party hence needed to keep reviewing their own policy to eliminate the influences of the old time and devise systems of economic management and finance for the minority nationalities.

=== Relationship between Party and non-Party ===
This part is the most liberal of the ten major relationships, as Mao opined that the existence of other political parties could serve the party well by providing supervision. Though democratic parties were composed of the national bourgeoisies and intellectuals, they offered &quot;well-intentioned criticisms.&quot; Even if the criticism was abusive, the party could refute by rational responses. Mao then envisioned the disappearance of the party, as the Marxist theory suggested the coming of a stateless society when communism is achieved, and even though a coercive party was needed to suppress counter-revolutionaries, he proposed to streamline the party and the bureaucracy.

=== Relationship between revolution and counter-revolution ===
Though counter-revolutionaries were negative factor, thanks to the policy of the party, some of them had stopped opposing the revolution. Whilst affirming the necessity of suppressing the counter-revolutionaries campaign in the early 1950s, Mao distanced himself from the Great Purge of Stalin and insisted that counter-revolutionaries like Hu Feng still existed and hence execution was needed in some cases to safeguard socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

=== Relationship between right and wrong ===
In this section Mao focused on those who made mistakes in the past, which include &quot;dogmatists headed by Wang Ming&quot; who led the party &quot;picking up the bad aspect of Stalin&#x27;s style of work&quot;. Mao used Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;The True Story of Ah Q&quot; to illustrate it was &quot;bad either to bar people outside the Party from the revolution or to prohibit erring comrades inside the Party from making amends.&quot; He suggested to observe those Communists who had erred but not those &quot;who cling to their mistakes and fail to mend their ways after repeated admonition&quot;.

=== Relationship between China and other countries ===
In the tenth point, Mao emphasized the importance of &quot;learning the strengths of all peoples and all countries.&quot;

Mao viewed the policy of learning from the other countries (implying the Soviet Union) had been right so far. Yet since that every nation had its weak points, China &quot;mustn&#x27;t copy everything indiscriminately and transplant mechanically&quot; and &quot;pick up their shortcomings and weak points.&quot; The Chinese Communists must be able to discern what were the strong or bad points from other countries to pick up. He used the example of the setting of a Ministry of Culture and a Bureau of Cinematography, instead of a Ministry of Cinematography and a Bureau of Culture like the case of the Soviet Union, to illustrate the importance of making a decision that best fitted the situations of China.

Regarding to the denouncement of the cult of personality of Stalin in the Soviet Union, Mao said that the &quot;assessment of 30 per cent for mistakes and 70 per cent for achievements&quot; for Stalin was &quot;just about right.&quot; He then recounted the history of Wang Ming&#x27;s &quot;left adventurism&quot; and &quot;right opportunism&quot; in the early history of the Chinese Communist Party which could be traced back to Stalin. In terms of socialist construction, Mao warned against the dogmatic following of Marxism–Leninism and applied their doctrines creatively.

Lastly, Mao summed up the two weaknesses of China, one being the lack of confidence among the people due to its colonial and semi-colonial past and the imperialist encroachment, and another being the delay of revolution which came only in 1949, four decades after the bourgeois revolution in 1911.

== Influence ==
In Mao Zedong&#x27;s own works, &quot;in the first eight years we copied foreign experiences, but since the ten major relationships was proposed in 1956, [the party] had found a path suitable for China.&quot; The speech was credited for setting the tone for the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party to be held in the second half of 1956, the first national congress after the founding of the new country in 1949. During the drafting process for the political report for the congress, Mao&#x27;s original idea was to set &quot;anti-rightist conservative thought&quot; as the guiding thought. After the speech was delivered, the ten major relationships became the guiding thought instead and it was followed up by Liu Shaoqi, Hu Qiaomu, and other top leaders in their preparation for the congress. During the congress Zhou Enlai reported on the proposal for the Second Five-year Plan (1956–1962) and issues highlighted by Mao in the speech, like the ratio of investment between heavy and light industries and decentralization, were addressed.

After the speech was distributed to local level, &quot;bearing in mind lessons drawn from the Soviet Union&quot; was understood differently. In early 1957, it was reported that many local units began to lose enthusiasm in Soviet experts, did not learn from them, and even became rude to them. Soviet experts were not assigned works and leaders in some bureaus did not form a close relationship with them. Some bureaucrats even refused to work with them. In response, the experts reported back to Moscow their observations and dissatisfaction with the Chinese counterparts.

&quot;Ten Major Relationships&quot;, along with &quot;On the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People,&quot; was an important part of the theoretical efforts to incorporate Marxism into the Chinese context and China&#x27;s efforts to develop socialism.

== Analysis ==

=== Soviet model of development and Sino-Soviet relations ===
Many considered the speech the beginning of Mao&#x27;s disagreement with the Soviet path of socialist development. Political scientist Frederick C. Teiwes believes that the thorough investigation of China&#x27;s situations in 1956 had urged top Chinese leaders to examine the shortcomings of the Soviet model critically and raise doubt about its applicability in China. Despite having a more mature industrial base, the Soviet economy grew slower than the Chinese one. A central change effected by the speech was the ratio of investment between heavy industry on one hand and light industry and agriculture on the other. In June 1956, the ratio of heavy industry to light industry was reduced from 8:1 to 7:1 and a few months later the proposed investment in agriculture had also increased from 7% to 10%. Also, the State Council planned to decentralize the administration of economic organizations and the use of indirect planning and market mechanisms were proposed and experimented in late 1956. Yet the attempt was soon curtailed because of the difficulties involved and opposition from economic planners.

Teiwes reminds that the Soviet Union themselves had also tried to decentralize in mid-1955 and it contributed to China&#x27;s reaction. An instance of such influence was the use of Soviet machine tractor for spreading the mechanization of agriculture but it was questioned by the Chinese side due to its insufficiency. Another instance was that the &quot;one-man management&quot; factory system, which placed authority in the hands of the factory manager, was never able to gain prominence in China except in the Northeast where the Soviet influence was strongest. Both practices were graduately abandoned by the Soviet Union.

Economist Chris Bramall believes that the period between April 1956 and June 1957 was Mao at his most conservative and the speech reinstated Mao&#x27;s economic policy of balanced development which was different from the Soviet emphasis on heavy industry. However, historian Shen Zhihua suggests that for adjusting the ratio of investment between heavy and light industries, altering the plan for industrial development, and improving people&#x27;s living standard, Mao&#x27;s development strategy in the speech did not differed significantly from the one in Khrushchev&#x27;s speech made in the party congress in the same year and their 6th Five-year Plan as well. In Shen&#x27;s view, China and the Soviet Union were both searching for the path for furthering socialist development.

=== Mao&#x27;s view on the state purchase of grain ===
In part four, Mao said that the party &quot;did make a mistake on the question of grain.&quot; In 1954, a decrease in production was accompanied by an increase in state purchase, making the peasants &quot;disgruntled, and there were a lot of complaints both inside and outside the Party.&quot; In 1955, the amount of grain purchased by the state decreased and there was a good harvest, reversing the peasants&#x27; opinion on the party. In historian Yang Kuisong&#x27;s analysis, in the 1950s Mao was actually deeply concerned about the livelihood of peasants but his view on the state purchase of grain and the burden exerted on peasants changed gradually from considering to exploitative because of two factors: 1) the implementation of the First Five-year plan in 1953, and 2) the overall and long-term benefit of the state.

The state collection of grain had been a strenuous issue for the new regime considering the fact that the War of Resistance against Japan (1937–1945) and the Civil War (1946–1949) had caused a devastating effect on the country&#x27;s economic activities. In the early 1950s, there were already incidents of peasants committing suicide or resisting the state collection despite Chen Yun&#x27;s urge of caution. As seen from the official figures, grain shortage in spring (chunhuang 春荒) might not be the most direct cause of unnatural death, as years with higher shortage could actually have fewer unnatural death. Instead, natural disaster and the state purchase of grain were what exerted burden on the peasants. After 1949, the state purchase of grain had been on the rise and the increase was the most prominent after the implementation of the state monopoly in 1953. In 1956–1967, the figure dropped and it did not increase until the Great Leap Forward.

Mao himself had directly intervened the policy on state purchase of grain in the early 1950s, requesting to lower the amount of grain to be purchased, so as to lighten the burden on peasants. During the period, the shortage of grain for peasants was a serious problem for the state which tried to maintain a low ratio of 30% in the purchase of grain. Chen Yun advocated a higher purchase ratio, which was opposed to Mao&#x27;s view of maintaining a low ratio, as he knew that placing too much pressure on peasants would be counterproductive.

But from 1953 onwards, Mao agreed with the view of economic planners and supported the state monopoly of the purchasing and marketing of grain. As the state monopoly was imposed, the state now had a better understanding of the amount of grain in the hands of peasants and in 1953, a total of 825 billion catties of grain was purchased, higher than the planned 708 billion. Emboldened by this increase, Chen Yun increased the amount even higher in 1954. The only concern for the planners was whether such increased led to massive death of peasants, which in 1955 a higher number of unnatural of death was indeed recorded. Other than &quot;Internal Reference&quot;, Mao also knew about the problem from the democrats who wrote to Mao to report the severity of increased state purchase. As a response, Mao instructed Chen Yun to lower the purchase and for 1955 and a lower amount was purchased.

=== Mao&#x27;s view on personality cult ===
In part ten Mao mentioned that &quot;in the Soviet Union, those who once extolled Stalin to the skies have now in one swoop consigned him to purgatory. Here in China some people are following their example.&quot; Shen Zhihua suggests that the criticism of personality cult of Stalin led to the removal of Mao Zedong Thought from the 8th party congress. The party constitution in the congress did not mention Mao Zedong Thought and all top party leaders did not mention it as well, which was different from the party constitution in the last congress which stated Mao Zedong Thought as one of the guiding principles, alongside Marxism and Leninism, for the Chinese revolution. Since Mao himself had more than once opposed the use of the term in internal communication, so its removal in the 8th party congress did not necessarily indicate that Mao&#x27;s status had been challenged as argued by some historians like Roderick MacFarquhar.

Though the trend of anti-personality cult was prevalent in the socialist camp after 1953, Shen argues that Mao only opposed the public use of Mao Zedong Thought, but not saw it as a problem itself. Hu Qiaomu explained that not mentioning Mao Zedong Thought was related to the Soviet Union who refused to accept the idea. And since China still relied on the Soviet Union in the early 1950s, so that was Mao&#x27;s policy to downplay the idea. The Soviet-Yugoslavia conflict in 1948 had signaled that Stalin would not tolerate alternative socialist path and the Soviet Union remained dominant in the socialist world. After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, however, the pressure from the Soviet Union lessened, yet Mao still had not put forward the use of Mao Zedong Though publicly because of the possible backlash due to the anti-personality cult in the Soviet Union. The development led to the concerns from top Chinese leaders. After the 20th Soviet party congress, personality cult became an even more sensitive issue and invited the speculation of whether there was personality cult in China. At local level, cadres started to raise doubt about the excessive praise given to Mao and internationally socialist countries also became cautious about personality cult. Yet the personal worship of Mao within the party already began in the Yan&#x27;an era, so it had a long historical root in the party. Though the criticism of Stalin relieved Mao of the pressure from the Soviet Union, it also made the personality cult of his own problematic. That is the reason why he highlighted that &quot;in China some people are following their example&quot; as a reminder that Mao was supportive of his own cult, but critical of that of Stalin.

== Subsequent development ==
Chris Bramall opines that in actual practice Mao did not follow what he stated in the speech and such view was echo by columnist Li Kwok-sing who claims that &quot;China has never followed the theory of the ten relationship.&quot; During and immediately after the Great Leap Forward, Mao went further on the repudiation of the Soviet development model through thoroughly criticizing two Soviet books, &quot;Political Economy: A Textbook&quot; and Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR&quot;.

As for the development of the interior regions and defense construction, in response to the military threat posed by the escalation of the Vietnam War and the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, China had significantly increased the investment in the interior regions through the Third Front construction projects. Eventually China developed her own nuclear weapons in the mid-1960s.

In 1995 Jiang Zemin delivered a speech on &quot;twelve major relationships&quot; of socialist development, echoing what Mao had stressed nearly 40 years earlier, though much less significance was attached to the speech. Jiang&#x27;s twelve relationships overlap with some of Mao&#x27;s.

== Circulation and edition ==

On the Ten Major Relationships and On the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People () were two important speeches that Mao delivered after 1949. The latter, delivered in February 1957, was revised by Mao himself and soon published on People&#x27;s Daily in June the same year, but the former was only circulated among the middle and top cadres and remained unpublished until after Mao&#x27;s death.

Contrary to his usual practice of editing his own drafts, Mao had left the speech untouched after 1956. In 1965, Liu Shiqi suggested to Mao the publication of the speech due to its importance but Mao was dissatisfied with it and opined that further revision was needed. It remained for circulation among cadres only and was not for publication. In December, the party central instructed cadres to study the speech and express their views on it. In summer 1975, Deng Xiaoping directed the editorial work of the fifth volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and suggested the inclusion of the speech. A further revision of the draft based on the original sound recording was prepared. After reading the revised draft, Mao agreed with its part-wide distribution, but still not its publication.

Mao had twice commented on the importance of the speech, in 1958 and 1960 respective, each stressing the search for alternative socialist development. Yet in other occasions, Mao did not value it as highly. In September 1956 when he received the representatives from Yugoslavia, he said that for the speech he just summarized others&#x27; opinions and that was not his own creation. In May 1957, he mentioned that if he was not satisfied with some drafts even after revision, they would remained unpublished, indicating that the speech was not up to his standard.

Other than the quality of the draft of the speech, another possible reason is the timing of political events. When Liu Shaoqi approached Mao in December 1965, Mao had already approved the criticism of the historical drama Hai Rui Dismissed from Office which was considered the preparation for initiating the Cultural Revolution. The major contents of the speech were on economic issues which were different from the anti-revisionism of the Cultural Revolution and hence Mao did not agree to publish the speech. In 1975 when Deng Xiaoping approached Mao, Deng was restoring the previous practices and negating the Cultural Revolution and for the same reason Mao again disagreed to publish the speech.

During the 2nd National Convention for Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture held in December 1976, the speech was chosen as a learning document. On the last day of the meeting, the article was published on People&#x27;s Daily in full text and a nationwide learning campaign followed. The speech was also included in the fifth volume of Mao&#x27;s Selected Works, with the following editorial:&quot;Bearing in mind lessons drawn from the Soviet Union, Comrade Mao Tsetung summed up China&#x27;s experience, dealt with ten major relationships in socialist revolution and socialist construction and set forth the ideas underlying the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, a line suited to the conditions of our country.&quot;The published edition in 1976 contained contented which were omitted from the internal edition in 1965, including the criticism on the handling of heavy and light industries and agricultural sector of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the criticism of Stalin, and other critiques. But the 1976 edition also did not contain all the contents from the speech in 1965.

<text>Depot Harbour is a ghost town on Wasauksing First Nation, in the Parry Sound District, Ontario, Canada. It was once the western terminus of the Canada Atlantic Railway and a busy port on Georgian Bay.

==Formation and rise==

In 1891, the Ottawa, Arnprior and Renfrew Railway and the Ottawa and Parry Sound Railway, two lines controlled by John Rudolphus Booth, amalgamated to form the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway with authority to execute a further amalgamation with the Parry Sound Colonization Railway. The PSCR was acquired in 1893, forming a railway that would run from Georgian Bay through southern Algonquin Park to Ottawa.

When the PSCR was taken over by Booth, the original intention was to have its terminus at Parry Sound. However, the high prices demanded by local landowners prompted him in 1895 to choose a location on nearby Parry Island, away. Early that year, Booth&#x27;s surveyors trespassed on the Indian reserve to run lines from Rose Point Narrows to the site. Taking advantage of a provision of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; that allowed native-owned land to be expropriated for use as a railway, he pressured the Anishinaabe reserve to sell to the railway. A further was acquired by expropriation in 1899.

When completed, Depot Harbour became one of the most prominent ports on the Great Lakes, rivalling Collingwood, Midland and Owen Sound. It was the shortest route for shipping grain to the Atlantic, with trains arriving and departing every twenty minutes, and was known as the best natural harbour on the Great Lakes.

Booth built a town site with 110 houses, along with two large grain elevators, docks, a railway station, a hotel and shops. The town&#x27;s population reached 1,600 permanent residents in 1926. There may have been as many as 3,000 inhabitants in the summers.

==Decline==

Booth sold his railway to the Grand Trunk Railway in 1904. In 1923, the railway became part of the government-owned Canadian National Railways. The reconstruction of the Welland Canal in 1932, along with 1933 abandonment of a portion of the line in Algonquin Provincial Park (as a consequence of the Cache Lake trestle being damaged by ice), and a drop in grain prices during the Great Depression, contributed to a loss of importance for Depot Harbour, and the CNR closed the facilities in favour of its own at South Parry. The town fell into disrepair and as its population gradually declined, Depot Harbour was abandoned.

During World War II, cordite manufactured in nearby Nobel was stored in the railway&#x27;s dockside freight sheds across the inlet from the grain elevators. In the summer of 1945, the timber frame grain elevators were dismantled. On August 14, as preparations were being made for V-J Day celebrations in other places, the partly dismantled elevators accidentally caught fire. Flying embers carried by the wind, landed on the roofs of the freight sheds, setting off explosives which destroyed whatever remained of the harbour facilities.

By late August 1959, all residential buildings had been removed, with only foundations remaining. After the debris had been cleared away from the site of the burnt-down grain elevators, the wharf was used as a distribution terminal for the Century Coal Company, a subsidiary of Canada Steamship Lines. As the market for coal declined in the late 1950s the docks were silenced once again. By 1959 use of the wharf was acquired by National Steel Corporation for loading pelletized iron ore from its Low Phos Mine at Sellwood. A rail mounted gantry crane was installed along the length of the wharf.

 and were regular visitors to Depot Harbour. When the mine closed in 1979, Depot Harbour was silenced once more.

The Anishinaabe reclaimed the expropriated lands in 1987. Little remains of the town except scattered foundations. The bank vault can still be found as well as the loading docks. Only one building remains in use as a cottage.

The port is still in use as a fish farm, owned by a local resident on the reserve.

<doc id="999947" wikidata="Q2638079" url="?curid=999947" title="Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado">
<text>Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado, 1st Marquess of Gutiérrez Mellado (30 April 1912 – 15 December 1995) was a Spanish Army officer and politician who played a relevant role during the Spanish transition to democracy.

During his military career he served in relevant Army offices and began a political career in 1976, when the Prime Minister appointed him as First Deputy Prime Minister for Defence Affairs. From 1977 to 1979 he also served as Minister of Defence (the first since the Civil War).

In 1994, the socialist government of Felipe González granted him the honorary rank of Captain General.

Gutiérrez Mellado&#x27;s most popular image is that at the Spanish Congress of the Deputies during the failed 1981 Spanish coup d&#x27;état he physically confronted the armed Guardia Civil troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero.

== Education and military training ==
Offspring of an ancient Madrilenian bourgeois family, his parents died when he was a little child. However, his uncle, Saturnino Calleja, a well known publisher, paid for his education at the Royal College of San Anton in Madrid, which was an elite boarding school at the time.

His wish to become an artillery officer was shattered by the military reforms of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in 1927, which forced him to study at the General Military Academy of Zaragoza, directed by General Francisco Franco, to obtain his qualifications.

Five months after the proclamation of the Spanish Second Republic he was promoted to second lieutenant and later finished his military education at the Academy of Artillery and Engineers of Segovia, where he graduated as first lieutenant in July 1933, having achieved top grades in his class.

== Second Republic and Civil War ==
His first appointment was the Horse Artillery Regiment, based at the so-called Canton of Campamento, an isolated group of barracks seven kilometers west of Madrid. In 1935 he joined Falange Española de las JONS, an extreme right wing political party, and on the dawn of July 20, 1936, he took arms with his unit in rebellion against the Frente Popular Government, being very active and combatant during their rebellion.

After ten hours of fighting, the coup was controlled by the republican militia. Gutiérrez Mellado escaped by walking to the nearby village of Villaviciosa de Odón, frequented by his family during their summer holidays, and later returned to Madrid in early August. Republican authorities indicted him for being involved in the July rebellion and he was jailed at his old school of San Anton, being fortunate enough not to have been included in the lethal lists that cost the lives of many other officers.

In February 1937, a jury declared him not guilty on the basis of his assertion, which was corroborated by two witnesses, that he was ill at Villaviciosa de Odón around the time of mid July and so was not able to take part in the coup d&#x27;état. However, simultaneous police inquires unveiled his active intervention in it, what induced him to take shelter at an embassy.

A few weeks later he joined Franco&#x27;s clandestine intelligence services operating in Madrid, provided with an ID card belonging to a deceased republican soldier named Teodosio Paredes Laina.

In March 1938 he was promoted to captain. National Authorities had just organized the Information and Military Police Service (SIPM in its Spanish acronym) and he was appointed head of one of the three SIPM platoons assigned to the corps that besieged the capital. Gutiérrez Mellado provided his superiors with precious pieces of information related to republican plans, deployment and armament. He also was put in charge of the evacuation of more than a hundred pilots and engineer officers to the National Zone, specialties which were much needed by the Francoist forces.

== Military career ==
In 1941, after graduating from the General Staff School, he was appointed to the Ministry of the Army intelligence services. During World War II, having been promoted to major, he became responsible for the classification and final destination of the thousands of people that crossed the Pyrenees escaping from Nazi terror.

In 1945, Gutiérrez Mellado was assigned to the Information Section of the High General Staff and travelled to Belgium, France and Switzerland to acquire information about attitudes and activities of republican exiles.

Furthermore, from 1953 to 1955, due to the pacts subscribed by Franco with the US Government, he acted as liaison officer between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), responsible for building the bases and facilities for US Armed Forces on Spanish soil.

In 1956, close his promotion to lieutenant colonel and forced by the meager pay offered to the military at the time, he decided to quit the Army temporarily. He then went to work as a commercial manager for seven years within various companies. Around this time, approximately two thirds of the military officers based in Spain&#x27;s largest cities were involved in the practice of moonlighting. However, only a few of them made the drastic decision to leave the Army, as Gutiérrez Mellado did, considering it unethical to hold two different jobs at the same time and led to the detriment of his military commitment.

In 1963 he returned to active duty as an instructor of the University Militia, which was aimed to train reserve officers and sergeants. Two years later, in 1965, he was promoted to colonel and assigned to the Operations Section of the Army Central Staff. Due to his fluency in English and French he was sent as an observer to several NATO maneuvers, which alerted him to the poor operational capacities of the highly overstaffed, late Francoist Spanish Armed Forces.

In 1967 Gutiérrez Mellado was assigned to be Commander in Chief of the 13th Field Artillery Regiment, based at Getafe, just outside Madrid; and on April 13, 1970, was promoted to brigadier general. For little more than a year he served as a professor at the High Center for National Defense Studies (CESEDEN), then directed by lieutenant general Manuel Díez-Alegría.

When Díez-Alegría was appointed Commander in Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, he took Gutiérrez Mellado with him. General Gutiérrez Mellado&#x27;s December 14, 1971, lecture at CESEDEN was the object of very favorable commentaries in military circles because of his speech&#x27;s direct and accurate nature —something rather unusual at that time in Spain.

After being promoted to major general in 1973, a second lecture at the same Center, dated March 15, 1974, drew much broader attention than the first, due to his open vindication of urgent and radical reforms on the Armed Forces structure and organization. These words attracted the attention of many future leaders of the transition towards democracy —Prince Juan Carlos de Bourbon among them.

On June 14, 1975, Franco appointed him as General Commander and Governmental Delegate in Ceuta, posts that he shared with his previous commitment as head of the military delegation responsible for negotiating the January 1976 Spanish-American legislative treaty.

On April 13, 1976, King Juan Carlos I first Government promoted him to lieutenant general in command of VII Military Region. His first public address to the troops upon arriving in Valladolid immediately became press headlines and was subject to laudatory editorials and opinions in many political reviews. Not in vain it was the first time, during those hazardous days of transition, with public opinion wondering and deeply worried about the Armed Forces’ future attitude and behavior, Spaniards heard of a high ranking Army officer openly aligned with the Rule of Law and demanding absolute respect from his subordinates towards civil power: “We must never forget that the Army, no matter how sacred its mission may be, is not there to rule but to serve under the command of the national government, and that its exclusive purpose is to serve Spain and our King”.

In July 1976, Gutiérrez Mellado was appointed Commander in Chief of the Army General Staff following favorable remarks about his virtues made by King Juan Carlos to Adolfo Suárez, the recently nominated Prime Minister.

Only three months later, on September 23, Gutiérrez Mellado was appointed vice president for Defense Affairs, a recently created office aimed at promoting the modernization of the Armed Forces. There he replaced lieutenant general Fernando de Santiago, who had abruptly resigned to demonstrate his opposition to President Suárez&#x27;s political reforms. Gutiérrez Mellado remained at that office until February 1981.

== Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense ==
Facts lead one to think that he had been planning carefully, when presented the proper opportunity, to quickly reform and transform Franco&#x27;s sclerotic Armed Forces in depth. That allowed him, with less than a hundred days in office, to outline a complete reform project to be submitted to the Military Affairs Governmental Commission&#x27;s first meeting on January 4, 1977, chaired by President Suárez.

His detailed reform project comprised a series of actions to be urgently taken on the following areas: defense superstructure; Armed Forces financial program; integrated personnel policy, and the limitation of the competence of military jurisdiction. The plan was wholly implemented before Gutiérrez Mellado left his office in 1981 and even successfully achieved other important issues, such as the creation of the Ministry of Defense on July 4, 1977.

Also on that date, he was also called to take charge of the new department and he remained in office until September 23, 1979, when the Democratic Center Union (UCD) executive, Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún, took over, thus becoming the first civilian to chair a military department since 1939. Gutiérrez Mellado remained as vice-president of the Government to coordinate Security and National Defense Affairs until President Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo&#x27;s investiture in February 1981.

In addition to creation and organization of the Ministry of Defense and the consequent suppression of the Ministries of the Army, Navy and Air Force, special consideration should be given to the following measures:

— instauration of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JUJEM);

— operative command attribution over their respective branches to the Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs of Staff;

— legislative approval of 1980 Law of Defense and Military Organization Basic Criteria;

— banning of military intervention in politics;

— reform of the General Ordinance dictated by Charles III in 1768;

— Armed Forces Social Institute (ISFAS) implementation;

— instauration of the annual Armed Forces Day to substitute the military parade commemorating Franco&#x27;s victory in the Spanish Civil War;

— officer promotion system regulation, and

— homologation of military salaries to those of public employees of a similar level (which most certainly abolished moonlighting).

It is obvious that this reform packet has been partially changed by the successive Ministers of Defense, but its doctrinal core has experienced few changes. In this respect Gutiérrez Mellado&#x27;s real merit was to establish the basis for the spectacular transformation of the Spanish Armed Forces which occurred during the last thirty years of the 20th century and which made them one of the most highly valued institutions in the opinion of the Spanish public, according to the Sociological Research Center (CIS) periodical surveys.

Gutiérrez Mellado&#x27;s most popular image is that at the Spanish Congress of the Deputies during the failed coup d&#x27;état on February 23rd 1981 he physically confronted the armed Guardia Civil troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Antonio Tejero. By mere chance, due to a simple oversight by a civil guard who did not notice that a TV camera was recording, every Spaniard had the chance to see live how a frail man, nearly seventy years old and unknown to most, jumped up from his parliamentary seat and, armed only with his words, faced a dozen rebels armed with pistols and submachine guns. They tried to manhandle him down to the floor but were unable to do so, whereupon they opened fire so as to avoid any further interruption of their criminal activities.

Television retransmission of his valiant defense of freedom would make Gutiérrez Mellado into a legendary figure in post-Franco Spanish Politics. His singular and stoic effort in the face of armed revolt today remains an icon of the resolve of Spain&#x27;s democratic government.

== Last years ==

After resigning his governmental duties and having also retired voluntarily from the Army, to exemplify incompatibility of politics and a military career. he refrained from public activities until President Felipe González gave him a permanent seat on the State Council on May 28, 1984, where he chaired the First Section, which dealt with Defense Affairs.

In September 1986, deeply touched by the death of close friend&#x27;s son from a drug overdose, he sought the aid and financial help of several relevant businessmen and established the Anti-Drug Aid Foundation (FAD) that he chaired until the very day of his death.

The main FAD objective was to mobilize citizenship to aid young people in overcoming drug addiction at a time when heroin was wreaking havoc in Western countries. Apart from trying to alleviate the effects of drugs and repress its trafficking and consumption, its founder wanted society to give teenagers strong moral backup to repel them and to be brave enough to answer “No thank you” if tempted, as could be read on their posters during their first publicity campaign.

In the years prior to his death, various Spanish Universities and Colleges opened their doors to listen to Gutiérrez Mellado lecturing about democratic transition or about FAD activities.

In 1994, King Juan Carlos I rewarded him with the hereditary title of Marquess of Gutiérrez Mellado; the Parliament, with the Constitutional Order, and the Army High Council unanimously proposed Felipe Gonzalez&#x27;s last Government to invest him with the honorary rank of Captain general of the Army. In September, 1994, dressed for the first and last time in his Captain General&#x27;s uniform, he received the homage of General Military Academy cadets at the same yard where, sixty-five years before, he had committed his life to defending the Spanish flag.

Fourteen months later, on December 15, 1995, ice on the road surface caused a fatal accident involving the car in which the eighty-three-year-old man was driving on his way to Barcelona to lecture at Ramon Llull University.

His funeral was held at the Army Headquarters, attended by the King and Queen of Spain, and he was buried at the cemetery of Villaviciosa de Odón. There he remains at the side of his wife, Carmen Blasco, who died in 2010, whom he had married in 1938 and was the mother of his five children.

After his death his daughter María del Carmen Gutiérrez-Mellado and Blasco became the 2nd Marchioness of Gutiérrez Mellado.

As a postmortem homage to his memory, the Ministry of Defense decided to give his name to a new center of studies patronized by the National Open University (UNED). The Instituto Universitario General Gutiérrez Mellado was born to promote defense culture among university students and to provide Spanish society with a specialized center of research and postgraduate studies on peace, security and defense.

<doc id="999948" wikidata="Q208404" url="?curid=999948" title="Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)">
<text>Armenia, also the Kingdom of Greater Armenia or simply Greater Armenia or Armenia Major ( &#x27;; ), sometimes referred to as theArmenian Empire under Tigranes II, was an Armenian kingdom in the Ancient Near East which existed from 331 BC to 428 AD. Its history is divided into the successive reigns of three royal dynasties: Orontid (331 BC–200 BC), Artaxiad (189 BC–12 AD), and Arsacid (52–428).

The root of the kingdom lies in one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia called Armenia (Satrapy of Armenia), which was formed from the territory of the Kingdom of Ararat (860 BC–590 BC) after it was conquered by the Median Empire in 590 BC. The satrapy became a kingdom in 321 BC during the reign of the Orontid dynasty after the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great, which was then incorporated as one of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Seleucid Empire.

Under the Seleucid Empire (312–63 BC), the Armenian throne was divided in two—Greater Armenia (state) and Sophene—both of which passed to members of the Artaxiad dynasty in 189 BC. During the Roman Republic&#x27;s eastern expansion, the Kingdom of Armenia, under Tigranes the Great, reached its peak, from 83 to 69 BC, after it reincorporated Sophene and conquered the remaining territories of the falling Seleucid Empire, effectively ending its existence and raising Armenia into an empire for a brief period, until it was itself conquered by Rome in 69 BC. The remaining Artaxiad kings ruled as clients of Rome until they were overthrown in 12 AD due to their possible allegiance to Rome&#x27;s main rival in the region, Parthia.

During the Roman–Parthian Wars, the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia was founded when Tiridates I, a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty, was proclaimed King of Armenia in 52. Throughout most of its history during this period, Armenia was heavily contested between Rome and Parthia, and the Armenian nobility was divided among pro-Roman, pro-Parthian or neutral factions. From 114 to 118, Armenia briefly became a province of the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan. The Kingdom of Armenia often served as a client state or vassal at the frontier of the two large empires and their successors, the Byzantine and Sassanid empires. In 301, Tiridates III proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armenian kingdom the first state in history to embrace Christianity officially.

In 387, Armenia was partitioned into Byzantine Armenia and Persian Armenia. The last Arsacid king of Armenia was deposed in 428, ending independent Armenian statehood until the emergence of Bagratid Armenia in the 9th century.

==History==
===Origins===
Prior to the 9th century BC, the geographic region known as the Armenian Highlands was inhabited by Proto-Armenian and other tribes which did not yet constitute a unitary state or nation. The first state to rule over a significant part of the Armenian Highlands was the Kingdom of Urartu, also known as the Kingdom of Van or Ararat and called Biainili in the Urartian language used by its rulers. The kingdom competed with Assyria over supremacy in the highlands of Ararat and the Fertile Crescent.

Both kingdoms fell to Iranian invaders from the east (the Medes, followed by the Achaemenid Persians) in the 6th century BC. Its territory was reorganized into a satrapy called Armenia. The Orontid dynasty ruled as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire for three centuries until the empire was defeated by Alexander the Great&#x27;s Macedonian Empire at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, a Macedonian general named Neoptolemus obtained Armenia until he died in 321 BC and the Orontids returned, not as satraps, but as kings.

===Orontid dynasty===
Orontes III and the ruler of Lesser Armenia, Mithridates, recognized themselves independent, thus elevating the former Armenian satrapy into a kingdom, giving birth to the kingdoms of Armenia and Lesser Armenia. Orontes III also defeated the Thessalian commander Menon, who wanted to capture Sper&#x27;s gold mines.

Weakened by the Seleucid Empire which succeeded the Macedonian Empire, the last Orontid king, Orontes IV, was overthrown in 201/200 BC and the kingdom was taken over by a commander of the Seleucid Empire, Artaxias (Artashes) I, who is presumed to have been related to the Orontid dynasty himself.

===Artaxiad dynasty===


The Seleucid Empire&#x27;s influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the Romans in the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by Artaxias I alongside the Armenian kingdom of Sophene led by Zariadres. Artaxias seized Yervandashat, united the Armenian Highlands at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of Artaxata near the Araxes River. According to Strabo and Plutarch, Hannibal received hospitality at the Armenian court of Artaxias I. The authors add an apocryphal story of how Hannibal planned and supervised the building of Artaxata. The new city was laid on a strategic position at the juncture of trade routes that connected the Ancient Greek world with Bactria, India and the Black Sea which permitted the Armenians to prosper. Tigranes the Great saw an opportunity for expansion in the constant civil strife to the south. In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he entered Syria, and soon established himself as ruler of Syria—putting the Seleucid Empire virtually at an end—and ruled peacefully for 17 years. During the zenith of his rule, Tigranes the Great extended Armenia&#x27;s territory outside of the Armenian Highland over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now south-eastern Turkey, Iran, Syria and Lebanon, becoming one of the most powerful states in the Roman East.

===Roman rule===
Armenia became a Roman client kingdom in 66 BC, after the final defeat of Armenia&#x27;s ally, Mithridates VI of Pontus by Pompey at the Battle of the Lycus.

Mark Antony invaded and defeated the kingdom in 34 BC, but the Romans lost hegemony during the Final War of the Roman Republic in 32–30 BC. In 20 BC, Augustus negotiated a truce with the Parthians, making Armenia a buffer zone between the two major powers.

Augustus installed Tigranes V as king of Armenia in AD 6, but ruled with Erato of Armenia. The Romans then installed Mithridates of Armenia as client king. Mithridates was arrested by Caligula, but later restored by Claudius. Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia, with both major powers supporting opposing sovereigns and usurpers. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission in AD 37, but in AD 47 the Romans retook control of the kingdom. In AD 51 Armenia fell to an Iberian invasion sponsored by Parthia, led by Rhadamistus. Tigranes VI of Armenia ruled from AD 58, again installed by Roman support. The period of turmoil ends in AD 66, when Tiridates I of Armenia was crowned king of Armenia by Nero. For the remaining duration of the Armenian kingdom, Rome still considered it a client kingdom &quot;de jure&quot;, but the ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction, and contemporary Roman writers thought that Nero had &quot;de facto&quot; yielded Armenia to the Parthians.

===Arsacid dynasty===
Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign (55–63) against the Parthian Empire, which had invaded the Kingdom of Armenia, allied with the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60, then losing it in 62, the Romans sent the Legio XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot; from Pannonia to Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, &quot;legatus&quot; of Syria. In 63, strengthened further by the legions III &quot;Gallica&quot;, V &quot;Macedonica&quot;, X &quot;Fretensis&quot; and XXII, General Corbulo entered into the territories of Vologases I of Parthia, who then returned the Armenian kingdom to Tiridates, king Vologases I&#x27;s brother. An agreement was reached at the Treaty of Rhandeia in 63, according to which members of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty would rule Armenia as client kings of Rome.

Another campaign was led by Emperor Lucius Verus in 162–165, after Vologases IV of Parthia had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. Sohaemus, a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new client king. But during an epidemic within the Roman forces, Parthians retook most of their lost territory in 166. Sohaemus retreated to Syria, and the Arsacid dynasty was restored to power in Armenia.

After the fall of the Arsacid dynasty in Persia, the succeeding Sassanid Empire aspired to reestablish Persian control. The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252. However, in 287, Tiridates III the Great was brought to power by the Roman armies. After Gregory the Illuminator&#x27;s spreading of Christianity in Armenia, Tiridates accepted Christianity and made it his kingdom&#x27;s official religion. The date of Armenia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity is traditionally held to be 301, preceding the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great&#x27;s conversion and the Edict of Milan by a dozen years.In 387, the Kingdom of Armenia was split between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanid Empire. Western Armenia first became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Armenia Minor, and later Byzantine Armenia; Eastern Armenia remained a kingdom within Persia until, in 428, the local nobility overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a &quot;marzban&quot; (governor) in his place, beginning the Marzpanate period over Persian Armenia. Those parts of historical Armenia remained firmly under Persian control until the Muslim conquest of Persia, while the Byzantine parts remained until being conquered, also by invading Arabic armies, in the 7th century. In 885, after years of Roman, Persian, and Arab rule, Armenia regained its independence under the Bagratuni dynasty.

==Army==

===Under Tigranes the Great===
The army of the Kingdom of Armenia reached its peak under the reign of Tigranes the Great. According to the author of &quot;Judith&quot;, his army included chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen, most likely heavy cavalry or cataphracts, a unit also commonly used by Seleucids and Parthians. His army consisted mainly of 120,000 infantrymen and 12,000 mounted archers, also an important feature of the Parthian army. Like the Seleucids, the bulk of Tigranes&#x27; army were foot soldiers. The Jewish historian Josephus talks of 500,000 men in total, including camp followers. These followers consisted of camels, donkeys, and mules used for baggage, sheep, cattle, and goats for food, said to be stocked in abundance for each man, and hoards of gold and silver. As a result, the marching Armenian army was listed as &quot;a huge, irregular force, too many to count, like locusts or the dust of the earth&quot;, not unlike many other enormous Eastern armies of the time. The smaller Cappadocian, Graeco-Phoenician, and Nabataean armies were generally no match for the sheer number of soldiers, with the organized Roman army with its legions eventually posing a much greater challenge to the Armenians.

Note that the numbers given by Israelite historians of the time were probably exaggerated, considering the fact that the Hasmonean Jews lost the war against Tigranes.

===Ayrudzi===

Since antiquity, Kingdom of Armenia had a cavalary called &quot;Azatavrear&quot;, which consisted mainly of elite Armenians. &quot;Azatavrear&quot; cavalry made up the main part of the king&#x27;s court. In medieval times, the cavalry were collected from nobles (usually the youngest sons of Armenian lords), and were known as Ayrudzi, or &quot;horsemen.&quot; During times of peace, Armenian cavalry were divided into small groups which took the roles of guarding the King and other Armenian lords, as well as their families. Some part of the Armenian cavalry force was always patrolling Armenian borders, under the command of an Armenian general (sparapet). The group of Armenian cavalry whose main mission was the protection of the Armenian king and his family consisted of 6000 heavily armored horsemen in the ancient period, and 3000 horsemen in the medieval period. During times of war, the number of Armenian cavalry would rise, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to at least 20,000 horsemen. Besides heavy cavalry, there was also light cavalry, which primarily consisted of mounted archers.

===Legio I Armeniaca-Armenian First Legion===
&quot;Legio Armeniaca&quot; translates from Latin as &quot;Armenian Legion&quot; and &quot;prima&quot; as &quot;first&quot;. The Armenian First Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This Legion was mentioned in the late-antique text known as Notitia Dignitatum. It is most likely that the Armenian First Legion was formed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, in the western part of the Kingdom, with the mission to protect the lands of Armenia from intrusion. It might first have been the garrison of Armenian lands which had been under the control of the Roman Empire. The Armenian First Legion took part in the ill-fated Persian campaign of the emperor Julianus Apostata in 363.

===Legio II Armeniaca-Armenian Second Legion===
&quot;Legio Armeniaca&quot; translates from Latin as &quot;Armenian Legion&quot; and &quot;Secunda&quot; as &quot;Second&quot;. Like the First legion, the Armenian Second Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This legion is also mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Armenian Second Legion was thought to have been created around the end of the 3rd century or in the beginning of the 4th century. The Armenian Second Legion had a permanent camp in one of the Northern provinces of the Orient, and built a camp in Satala. The Armenian Second legion is mentioned in the year 360 AD as a part of the garrison of Bezabda (anciently called Phoencia) in upper Tigris. In Bezabde the Armenian Second Legion served together with the Legions Parthica and II Flavia. In 390 AD Bezabde was taken by the Persian army, and a terrible bloodbath ensued against the inhabitants and garrison. The legion seemed to have survived this battle, because it appears in Notitia Dignitatum, which was written in the 5th century.

Later on, the Armenian Second legion became a part of the Byzantine army.

==Mythology and pre-Christian religion==

The pre-Christian Armenian pantheon included:
* Aramazd – Cognate of the Iranian Ahura Mazda (or Ormazd). Head of the pantheon, identified with Zeus in the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;.
* Amanor and/or Vanatur – God of the Armenian new year, Navasard, at the end of July. His temple was located in Diyadin.
* Anahit – Cognate of the Iranian Anahita. The goddess of fertility and birth, and daughter or wife of Aramazd, Anahit is identified with Artemis and Aphrodite. Temples dedicated to Anahit were established in Armavir, Artashat, Ashtishat.
* Ara &quot;the Beautiful&quot; – a dying-and-rising god slain in a war against Semiramis.
* Astghik – Cognate of the Semitic Ishtar. Fertility goddess and consort of Vahagn, sharing a temple with him at Derik. The holiday of Vardavar was originally in honor of Astghik.
* Barsamin – God of sky and weather, probably derived from the Semitic god Baal Shamin.
* Hayk – Legendary forefather of the Armenian people, archer, and slayer of the Titan Bel.
* Mihr – Cognate with the Persian Mithra. God of the sun and light, son of Aramazd, the brother of Anahit and Nane. His center of worship was located in Bagaharich, and the temple of Garni was dedicated to him.
* Nane – Possible cognate of the Sumerian Nanaya. Daughter of Aramazd, war and motherhood goddess. Her cult was related to Anahit, both of their temples located near each other in Gavar.
* Tir or Tiur – God of wisdom, culture, science and studies, he also was an interpreter of dreams. He was the messenger of the gods and was associated with Apollo. Tir&#x27;s temple was located near Artashat.
* Tsovinar – Also called Nar, she was the goddess of rain, sea and water, though she was actually a fiery being who forced rain to fall.
* Vahagn – Cognate of the Iranian Verethragna. The storm god and herculean dragon slayer. Derik housed the central temple to Vahagn.

During the 1st century AD, Christianity spread through Armenia due to (according to legend) the efforts of the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus. After persecutions by kings Sanatruk, Axidares, Khosrov I, and Tiridates III, Christianity was adopted as the state religion by Tiridates III after he was converted by Gregory the Illuminator. Armenia&#x27;s adoption of Christianity as the state religion (the first country to do so) distinguished it from Parthian and Mazdaen influence.

===Zoroastrianism===

Until the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land. With the advent of Christianity, both paganism and Zoroastrianism gradually started to diminish. The founder of the Arsacid branch in Armenia, Tiridates I, was a Zoroastrian priest or magus. A noted episode which illustrates the observance by the Armenian Arsacids is the famous journey of Tiridates I to Rome in A.D. 65–66. With the adoption of Christianity in the early 4th century, Zoroastrianism&#x27;s influence in the kingdom gradually started to decline.
==Literature==
Little is known about pre-Christian Armenian literature. Many literature pieces known to us were saved and then presented to us by Moses of Chorene. This is a pagan Armenian song, telling about the birth of Vahagn:
Armenian version

&lt;poem&gt;Երկնէր երկին, երկնէր երկիր,
Երկնէր եւ ծովն ծիրանի,
Երկն ի ծովուն ունէր և զկարմրիկն եղեգնիկ։

Ընդ եղեգան փող ծուխ ելանէր,
Ընդ եղեգան փող բոց ելանէր,
Եւ ի բոցոյն վազէր խարտեաշ պատանեկիկ։

Նա հուր հեր ունէր,
Բոց ունէր մօրուս,
Եւ աչքունքն էին արեգակունք։&lt;/poem&gt;
Translation

&lt;poem&gt;In travail were heaven and earth,
In travail, too, the purple sea,
The travail held in the sea the small red reed.

Through the hollow of the stalk came forth smoke,
Through the hollow of the stalk came forth flame,
And out of the flame a youth ran․

Fiery hair had he,
Ay, too, he had flaming beard,
And his eyes, they were as suns.&lt;/poem&gt;
==Language==

Before the Armenian alphabet was created, Armenians used the Aramaic and Greek alphabets, the last of which had a great influence on the Armenian alphabet.

The Armenian alphabet was created by Saint Mesrop Mashtots and Isaac of Armenia (Sahak Partev) in AD 405, primarily for a Bible translation into the Armenian language. Traditionally, the following phrase translated from Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Book of Proverbs&quot; is said to be the first sentence to be written down in Armenian by Mashtots:
By the 2nd century BC, according to Strabo, the inhabitants of Greater Armenia spoke the Armenian language, implying that modern Armenians descended from that population.

==Capitals==
* Yervandashat – The ancient town sits upon an escarpment overlooking the junction of the Arax River and Akhurian River. According to Movses Kaghankatvatsi, Orontes IV founded Yervandashat to replace Armavir as his capital after Armavir had been left dry by a shift of the Arax. The archaeological site has not been subject of major research, but fortifications and some remains of palaces have been uncovered. Ancient Yervandashat was destroyed by the army of the Persian King Shapur II in the 360s.
* Artashat (Artaxata) – King Artashes I founded Artashat in 185 BC in the region of Ostan within the historical province of Ayrarat, at the point where the Araks river was joined by the Metsamor river during the ancient era, near the heights of Khor Virap. The story of the foundation is given by the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi of the 5th century: &quot;Artashes traveled to the location of the confluence of the Eraskh and Metsamor [rivers] and taking a liking to the position of the hills (adjacent to Mount Ararat), he chose it as the location of his new city, naming it after himself.&quot; According to the accounts given by Greek historians Plutarch and Strabo, Artashat is said to have been chosen and developed on the advice of the Carthaginian general Hannibal. The city&#x27;s strategic position in the Araks valley on the Silk Road soon made Artashat a centre of bustling economic activity and thriving international trade, linking Persia and Mesopotamia with the Caucasus and Asia Minor. Its economic wealth can be gauged in the numerous bathhouses, markets, workshops, and administrative buildings that sprang up during the reign of Artashes I. The city had its own treasury and customs. The amphitheatre of Artashat was built during the reign of king Artavasdes II (55–34 BC). The remains of the huge walls surrounding the city built by King Artashes I can still be found in the area. After losing its status as a capital, Artashat gradually lost its significance.
* Tigranakert was founded by the Armenian emperor Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC. Tigranakert was founded as the new capital of the Armenian Empire in order to be in a more central position within the boundaries of the expanding empire. Its population was 120,000 and it also had many temples and an amphitheater.
* Vagharshapat – In the first half of the 1st century, during the reign of the Armenian Arshakuni king Vologases I (Vagharsh I) (117–144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed Vagharshapat, which still persists as the official appellation of the city. The original name, as preserved by Byzantine historian Procopius (&quot;Persian Wars&quot;), was Valashabad—&quot;Valash/Balash city&quot; named after king Balash/Valash/Valarsh of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial L into a Gh, which is common in Armenian language. Khorenatsi mentions that the town of Vardges was totally rebuilt and fenced by Vagharsh I, eventually becoming known as Norakaghak (&#x27;New City&#x27;) or Vagharshapat. The city served as a capital for the Arshakuni Kingdom of Armenia between 120 and 330 AD and remained the country&#x27;s most important city until the end of the 4th century. When Christianity became the state religion of Armenia, Vagharshapat was eventually called Ejmiatsin (or Etchmiadzin), after the name of the Mother Cathedral. Starting in 301, the city became the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation, home to the Armenian Catholicosate, one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. Vagharshapat was home to one of the oldest schools established by Saint Mashtots and the home of the first manuscripts library in Armenia founded in 480 AD. Starting in the 6th century, the city slowly lost its importance—especially after the transfer of the seat of the Catholicosate to Dvin in 452—until the foundation of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 885. After the fall of the Bagratid dynasty in 1045, the city gradually became an insignificant place until 1441, when the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate was transferred from the Cilician town of Sis back to Etchmiadzin.
* Dvin – The ancient city of Dvin was built by Khosrov III the Small in 335 on the site of an ancient settlement and fortress from the 3rd millennium BC. The palace in Dvin contained a Zoroastrian fire-temple constructed by Sasanians. Since then the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian kings of the Arshakuni dynasty. Dvin had a population of about 100,000 citizens of various professions including arts and crafts, trade, fishing, etc. After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin became the residence of Sassanid-appointed &quot;marzpans&quot; (governors), Byzantine &quot;kouropalates&quot; and later Umayyad and Abbasid-appointed &quot;ostikans&quot; (governors), all of whom were of senior nakharar stock. In 640 Dvin was the center of the emirate of Armenia.

==Political geography==
The Kingdom of Armenia was bordered by Caucasian Albania in the east, Iberia in the north, the Roman Empire in the west, and Parthia, later succeeded by Sassanian Empire, in the south. The border between Iberia and the Kingdom of Armenia was the Kur River, which was also the border between Caucasian Albania and Kingdom of Armenia.

After 331 BC, Armenia was divided into Lesser Armenia (a region of the Kingdom of Pontus), the Kingdom of Armenia (corresponding to Armenia Major) and the Kingdom of Sophene. In 189 BC when Artashes I&#x27;s reign began, many neighboring countries (Media, Caucasian Iberia, Seleucid Empire) exploiting the weakened state of the kingdom, conquered its remote regions. Strabo says that Artaxias I campaigned in the east and reunited Caspiane and Paytakaran, then campaigned in the north, defeated the Iberians, reuniting Gugark (Strabo also notes that Iberia recognized themselves as vassals of the Kingdom of Armenia at this time), to the west, reuniting Karin, Ekeghik and Derjan and to the south, where, after many battles with the Seleucid Empire, he reunited Tmorik. Artaxias I was not able to reunite Lesser Armenia, Corduene, and Sophene, something completed by his grandson Tigranes the Great. At its peak, under Tigranes the Great, it incorporated, besides Armenia Major, Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Armenian Mesopotamia, Osroene, Adiabene, Syria, Assyria, Commagene, Sophene, Judea and Atropatene. Parthia and also some Arab tribes were vassals of Tigranes the Great.

===Provinces===

Traditionally, Greater Armenia was divided into 15 provinces. These provinces all existed at some point, but they never existed all at the same time. In reality, Greater Armenia comprised nearly 200 districts of varying sizes and types. The 15 provinces were as follows:

* Upper Armenia
* Sophene
* Aghdznik
* Turuberan
* Corduene
* Moxoene
* Nor Shirakan
* Vaspurakan
* Syunik
* Artsakh
* Paytakaran
* Utik
* Gugark
* Tayk
* Ayrarat
Other Armenian regions:
* Lesser Armenia (not part of the Kingdom of Armenia)
* Armenian Mesopotamia

<text>Prinz is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater on the Oceanus Procellarum. It was named after German-Belgian astronomer . The formation lies to the southwest of the prominent crater Aristarchus. To the north-northeast is the flooded crater Krieger.

The rim of Prinz is the most intact in its northeastern half, while a large gap exists in the southern end of the crater wall. The rim climbs to a maximum height of 1.0 km above the base. It is attached along the eastern rim by a low ridge that is part of the foothills of the small Montes Harbinger range to the northeast. The region of the mare about Prinz is marked by rays and secondary craters from Aristarchus.


==Rimae Prinz==
Just to the north of Prinz is a system of rilles designated the Rimae Prinz. These are sinuous in nature and extend for up to 80 kilometers. The tiny crater Vera is only a couple of kilometers to the north of Prinz&#x27;s rim, and serves as the origin of one of these rilles. Within the same rille complex is the tiny crater Ivan. The crater Vera was previously identified as Prinz A, and Ivan as Prinz B, before they were assigned names by the IAU.

To the northwest is another distinct rille system designated Rimae Aristarchus.

<text>.su is an Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) that was designated for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on 19 September 1990. Even though the Soviet Union itself was dissolved 15 months later, the .su top-level domain remains in use to the present day. It is administered by the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN, or RosNIIROS in Russian transcription).

The .su ccTLD is known for usage by cybercriminals, hackers and scammers.

== History ==
After 1989 a set of new internet domains was created in Europe, including .pl (Poland), .cs (Czechoslovakia), .yu (Yugoslavia) and .dd (East Germany). Among them, there was also a domain for the USSR – .su. Initially, before two-letter ccTLDs became standard, the Soviet Union was to receive a .ussr domain. The .su domain was proposed by the 19-year-old Finnish student Petri Ojala.

On 26 December 1991 the country was dissolved and its constituent republics gained independence, which should have caused the domain to begin a phase-out process, as happened with those of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Until 1994 there was no assigned top-level domain name for Russia. For this reason the country continued to use the Soviet domain. In 1994, the .ru domain was created, which was supposed to eventually replace the .su domain (domains for the republics other than Russia were created at different times in the mid-nineties). The domain was supposed to be withdrawn by ICANN, but it was kept at the request of the Russian government and Internet users.

In 2001, the managers of the domain stated that they would commence accepting new .su registrations, but it is unclear whether this action was compatible with ICANN policies. ICANN has expressed intentions to terminate the .su domain and IANA states that the domain is being phased out, but lobbyists stated in September 2007 that they had started negotiations with ICANN on retaining the domain. In the first quarter of 2008, .su registrations increased by 45%.

== Usage ==
The domain was intended to be used by Soviet institutions and companies operating in the USSR. The dissolution of the Soviet Union meant that the new TLD was superseded by the new country TLDs of the former Soviet republics. Despite this, .su is still in use. Most of the .su domains are registered in Russia and the United States. According to the &quot;RU-CENTER&quot; data from May 2010, there were over 93,500 registered domains with the .su TLD (there are over 2.8 million .ru domains). Some organizations with roots in the former Soviet Union also still use this TLD. The pro-Russian Ukrainian separatist group Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic have also registered their domain with the TLD. The .su domain also hosts white supremacist websites that have been deplatformed elsewhere, formerly including &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot;. 

The domain has been reported to host many cybercrime activities due to the relaxed and outdated terms of use, along with staying out of focus (2% usage comparing to the primary .ru zone). Rules for timely suspension of malicious domains have been in place since 2013 in response to the issue.

<text>Pytheas is a small lunar impact crater located on the southern part of the Mare Imbrium, to the south of the crater Lambert. It was named after ancient Greek navigator and geographer Pytheas of Massalia.

It has a sharply defined rim, a hummocky outer , and an irregular interior due to slumping or fall-back. There is a small crater along the northern outer , and a similar crater about 20 km to the west. The crater possesses a small ray system that extends for a radius of about 50 kilometers. It is surrounded by lunar mare that is dusted with ray material from Copernicus to the south.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pytheas.

<text>One Tree Hill is an American drama television series created by Mark Schwahn, which premiered on September 23, 2003, on the WB. After the series&#x27; third season, the WB merged with UPN to form the CW, and from September 27, 2006, the series was broadcast by the CW in the United States until the end of its run on April 4, 2012. The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill, North Carolina, and initially follows the lives of two half-brothers, played by Chad Michael Murray and James Lafferty, who compete for positions on their school&#x27;s basketball team and the drama that ensues from the brothers&#x27; respective romantic relationships.

Most of the filming took place in and around Wilmington, North Carolina. Many of the scenes were shot near the battleship USS &quot;North Carolina&quot; and on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus. The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters&#x27; lives through their high school years. Within these seasons, we see the characters build unexpected relationships as they face the challenges of growing up in a small town. However, at the beginning of the fifth season, Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college. This season featured a new storyline supported by flashbacks to their college years. Later, Schwahn made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season. The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be&quot; by Gavin DeGraw. The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs, to add more time for the storyline, and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters&#x27; adolescent past than their present maturity. The opening then consisted only of the title against a black background. The theme was restored for season 8, in response to audience demand, and was sung by a different artist each episode.

The series premiered to 2.5million viewers and rose to 3.3million in its second week, becoming one of only three shows to rise in their second episode during the 2003–2004 television season. The series received numerous award nominations, winning two Teen Choice Awards.

On May 12, 2009, it was confirmed that Murray and Hilarie Burton had declined to return for the seventh season, although accounts of what transpired vary. Their characters, Lucas and Peyton, had been two of the five lead characters and had provided one of the series&#x27; central love stories throughout the show. On May 17, 2011, the CW renewed &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; for a ninth and final season, placing an order for 13 episodes. Bethany Joy Lenz and Sophia Bush were signed as full-time regulars for one final season, and Lafferty appeared as a part-time regular. Murray returned for a special appearance during the final season, which premiered on January 11, 2012. The show is the fourth-longest-running series on the CW network, or the networks that came together to make it up (the WB and UPN), after &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;.

In August 2024, it was reported that a revival of the series was in development, with Bush and Burton returning while conversations with other cast members were ongoing.

Set in the fictional North Carolina coastal town of Tree Hill, the main storyline in the early seasons is the relationship between two half-brothers, Lucas and Nathan Scott, who start out as enemies but bonded as the show progresses. The show starts out with Lucas becoming a member of the Tree Hill Ravens (the high school basketball team) with the help of his uncle Keith. Nathan, the team captain, is threatened by this and it becomes the basis of their rivalry, also fueled by Lucas&#x27;s romantic interest in Nathan&#x27;s girlfriend, Peyton Sawyer. Later on, Brooke Davis, Peyton&#x27;s best friend, tries to date Lucas, while Nathan attempts to date Lucas&#x27;s best friend Haley James. The character of Lucas and Nathan&#x27;s father, Dan Scott, is occasionally explored throughout. There is a focus on his relationships with Karen Roe, Lucas&#x27;s mother, and Deb Scott, Nathan&#x27;s mother, and his decision to stay with Deb rather than Karen, thus abandoning Lucas. These experiences eventually bond the brothers as the series progresses and life unravels for both of them.

===Conception===
Schwahn originally planned to make &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; a feature length film with the title &quot;Ravens&quot;, the name of the show&#x27;s high school basketball team. However, he became convinced that it would be more interesting as a television series. He said the idea for the story came from his own personal experiences. As in the setting of the show, Schwahn went to school in a small town and played on a basketball team. He described himself as similar to the character of Mouth McFadden. Schwahn said that in designing the show, he created Lucas as &quot;this underdog kid from the wrong side of the tracks&quot; who crosses over to the pretty and popular; he wanted to show the life of such a person in a basketball context, feeling that basketball was a great platform for telling stories.

The title of the show and the name of the fictional town where the series takes place are derived from the song &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, which is named after the landmark in New Zealand. Most of the show&#x27;s episodes are titles of songs, bands or albums. Schwahn named the town &quot;Tree Hill&quot; because, while he was writing the idea for the show, he had been listening to the album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; by U2. In the early days, fans often asked Schwahn why the show was named &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; when the town was just called Tree Hill. The question is ostensibly answered when Karen tells Lucas in episode 1.22, &quot;There is only one Tree Hill ... and it&#x27;s your home.&quot; The same sentence is said by Haley to Jamie on the roof of Karen&#x27;s Cafe in episode 9.13, the series finale.

===Music===

Music plays a significant part in the plot and the movement of the scenes throughout the show. Schwahn revealed that each episode is named after a particular song, band or album that has something in common with the theme of the episode. Popular indie music has been featured on the show, and various artists have guest-starred.
Three soundtrack albums from the show have been released: &quot;One Tree Hill – Music From The WB Television Series, Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Friends with Benefit: Music from the Television Series One Tree Hill, Volume 2&quot;, and &quot;The Road Mix: Music from the Television Series One Tree Hill, Volume 3&quot;. A portion of the proceeds of the second soundtrack go to the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), tying in with a storyline on the show involving breast cancer. On November 13, 2008, iTunes published a soundtrack called &quot;Music From One Tree Hill&quot;, which contained songs from the sixth season.

===Episode format===
Episodes follow a regular structure. An episode normally begins with a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, although this is sometimes dropped to satisfy time constraints. During the first four seasons, the theme tune is played either immediately after the recap or after the first few scenes. Whenever an episode features sensitive or violent subjects, or when an episode&#x27;s running length is close to the total allotted time, there is no opening montage, but only &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; written on a black background. From the beginning of season 5, the theme song, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be&quot; by Gavin DeGraw, was abandoned, and only the single white-on-black title was used. The theme was restored for season 8, sung by different artists each week. Schwahn&#x27;s reasons for removing the theme were various:

&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; is known for its numerous voice-overs featuring either literary quotes or characters reflecting on events of the episode. Most of them have been made by Chad Michael Murray&#x27;s character Lucas. However, other characters have done so several times. Guest stars Bryan Greenberg, Sheryl Lee, Torrey DeVitto, and Ashley Rickards have also done voice-overs for single episodes. Characters who interact with the main cast, such as Bevin, Chase, Shelly and Glenda, helped to narrate the joint episodes, being portrayed by Bevin Prince, Stephen Colletti, Elisabeth Harnois and Amber Wallace. As the show progresses, songs continue to replace voiceovers occasionally. At the beginning of season 7, Paul Johansson&#x27;s character, Dan Scott, has taken over the narrator&#x27;s role.

In 2008, a black and white episode on a film noir theme was planned, to be written by Chad Michael Murray. Schwahn said, &quot;I think that noir-themed is very risky, because I think that can be very dark and very guy-ish in its approach. I&#x27;d say this is more &quot;Casablanca&quot; infused.&quot;

===Series timeline===
&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; starts in 2003 and has a complicated timeline, which varies between contrasting with and corresponding to the real world. In the first season, the main teenage characters are aged sixteen. The first and second seasons cover one year, and the third and fourth seasons another, so the main teenage characters are nearly eighteen at the end of the fourth season. The timeline was further complicated in the fifth season when the show was &quot;dramatically retooled and set four years into the future – after the characters [had] already graduated from college&quot;. The fifth season began shooting on July 30, 2007, and premiered January 8, 2008. In it, the characters were stated to be aged twenty-two. In 2009, Schwahn altered the timeline again, setting the seventh season fourteen months after the sixth, thus giving a better explanation for the somewhat abrupt departures of series leads Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton.

Explaining the decision to start the series with the teenagers as juniors, Schwahn said, &quot;Lucas and Nathan were important players on the [basketball] team, the most important, and I just couldn&#x27;t see that happening to freshmen.&quot; He also wanted to keep the characters in high school longer, saying, &quot;I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college and what have you, and I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It&#x27;s hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles.&quot; Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. &quot;The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It&#x27;s very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show,&quot; he said, and elaborated:

Schwahn felt that altering the series in this way allowed the storylines to be a little more complex, and said the actors welcomed the change. By the end of the seventh season, Schwahn and the production team assumed that the network had given the show its last season and decided to create a &quot;mini&quot; series finale in case the show was not renewed. For the season eight finale, the episode spanned an entire year, showing the progression of Brooke&#x27;s pregnancy over the course of the episode. It was announced by the network a day after the finale that the show was to be renewed for a ninth and final season. The show features a further time jump of one year in the season opener and a further flash forward in the series finale, showing Jamie playing a high school basketball game on the Tree Hill Ravens, his jersey hanging on the wall with a plaque that reads &quot;All Time Leading Scorer&quot;.

===Departures of Murray and Burton===
In 2009, Murray and Burton were confirmed as having declined to return to the series. For months, it was speculated that they would not be returning for the seventh season. In February, The CW announced a series renewal without specifying which cast members had renewed their contracts. A video of Murray, seemingly unaware he was being filmed, saying the show was not bringing him back because they wanted to save money, and encouraging fans to rally behind him, intensified speculation. A video of Burton saying she would stay if she had creative control also surfaced, fueling speculation that The CW did not want to keep Burton on the show without Murray. To some fans, who considered the heart of the show to be the dynamic between Lucas and Peyton, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; without the two characters would not work. A TVGuide.com poll found that nearly half of respondents were, however, willing to take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to a revamped version of the series. In April, Schwann told a crowd in Paris that all of the actors had signed on for season 7, except for Murray and Burton. &quot;They&#x27;re in negotiations right now and I know they&#x27;ve been offered great things, and hopefully they&#x27;ll decide to come back&quot;, he said. &quot;If they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s always a possibility ... [the show] has made it through some of the riskier moves we&#x27;ve done.&quot; In May, CW entertainment president Dawn Ostroff stated, &quot;We tried to get them to stay; we would have been thrilled if they wanted to.&quot; She said that since Murray and Burton were moving on, Tree Hill now had to reinvent itself a bit – as it did in 2007, with the four-year flash-forward. &quot;A show going into its seventh year is very open to reinventing itself,&quot; said Ostroff. &quot;And one thing I have to give Mark Schwahn a lot of credit for is that he has kept the show so fresh all these years.&quot;

Burton told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that there was a possibility that she would return for guest appearances if asked, and clarified what happened behind the scenes regarding her contract, stating, &quot;[W]hen I hear that there&#x27;s turmoil or negotiations based on money, it kind of hurts my feelings, because it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s been going on at all.&quot; She said, &quot;I think my fan base in particular knows that money isn&#x27;t necessarily a big motivator for me, that&#x27;s why I work in the world of independent film.&quot; Burton had known for some time that she was leaving, adding, &quot;For me, it was definitely an emotional decision. And a professional decision as well. I got really, really lucky. &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was my very first television audition; it was a fairytale. I feel really lucky to have that level of success right out of the gate.&quot; Referring to a video she had sent to her fans, she said:

Criticism of how their characters, Lucas and Peyton, were written out of the series focused mainly on a lack of explanation about where they went, and the exit not having been morbid enough for a star-crossed couple. Although the episode featuring their departure is initially grim, the episode&#x27;s tone is drastically different by the end. Some expected a tragic ending because of Lucas and Peyton&#x27;s star-crossed history and the show&#x27;s penchant for shocking finales. MTV developed tragic scenarios for how to write the couple out of the series but concluded by saying, &quot;Maybe after all they&#x27;ve been through in six seasons, these two deserved their happy ending&quot;. Fans were also glad the couple was finally given the happily-ever-after they felt the two deserved. Their exit was picked as one of the &quot;12 most essential episodes of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;&quot; in 2009 by fans at starnewsonline.com.

Schwahn said that he knew that many people would tune in to see how the show would explain Lucas and Peyton&#x27;s absence, and that the explanation was that they were traveling. He was aware that people might not accept the new version of the show, but said that it needed to move on. To fill the void of Murray and Burton&#x27;s departures, Robert Buckley and Shantel VanSanten were cast as Nathan&#x27;s agent Clay and Haley&#x27;s sister Quinn respectively. Austin Nichols, who plays Julian Baker, was also upgraded to series regular status. Plans for Murray and Burton to return to the series in Season 8 were confirmed. Schwahn said that the actors&#x27; busy schedules could possibly prevent a return in time for Brooke&#x27;s wedding, but he hoped they could return later in the season. On December 7, 2010, Kristin Dos Santos stated that Murray and Burton would definitely not be back for Brooke&#x27;s wedding, but that they were still expected to return. In January 2011, Burton confirmed that she would not be returning. In August 2011, The CW revealed that Murray would return for a guest appearance in the final season. Burton did not return, as she was not asked back that time around.

===Sponsorships and cross-promotion===
&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; regularly incorporated paid sponsors and cross-promotion into the show&#x27;s set, narrative, and fan interactions. In 2008, Nielsen Media Research reported that &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; was the only scripted show ranked among the top 10 in terms of number of product placements. Some instances include Sunkist products visible at concerts, in the characters&#x27; fridges, and on the school&#x27;s vending machines. In a fifth-season episode, Mia agrees to take part in both Rock the Vote and a Starburst-funded concert.

One Tree Hill also partnered with sponsors to invite fan participation in the show. During the second season, AT&amp;T sponsored a poll where fans could determine the outcome of a storyline by texting whether or not Nathan should kiss Haley&#x27;s sister, Taylor. In 2007, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; filmed their prom episode in Honey Grove, Texas, as the result of a Sunkist-sponsored competition where fans could submit videos inviting the cast and crew to their town. In 2008, the CW, Warner Bros. and Macy&#x27;s partnered to offer eight &quot;passionate&quot; fans the chance for a walk-on role on the show and a weekend with the cast, billed as the &quot;Ultimate Fan Weekend in Wilmington&quot;.

In an attempt to promote &quot;Life Unexpected&quot; to &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; viewers, the CW aired a crossover event involving both programs on October 12, 2010. Beginning with the &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; episode &quot;Nobody Taught Us to Quit&quot;, and continuing in the &quot;Life Unexpected&quot; episode &quot;Music Faced&quot;, Haley James Scott and Mia Catalano travel to Portland to perform at a music festival hosted by K-100, the radio station where &quot;Life Unexpected&quot;″s Cate Cassidy works. The characters meet and bond as a result.

== Themes ==
&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; consists of various themes, such as love, friendship, rivalries and betrayal, and explores the reasons behind them. Neal Solon of DVD Verdict stated, &quot;Much of the show is based on the mistakes the teens&#x27; parents have made and the way these mistakes manifest themselves in the students&#x27; lives.&quot; Two of the show&#x27;s most prominent themes have been basketball and romance.

===Basketball===
 Basketball is a core aspect of the show, helping to create an atmosphere of masculinity and attract male viewers. TheCinemaSource.com said of the show&#x27;s early seasons, &quot;The only thing you might notice that&#x27;s strange is that the teens&#x27; school lives are heavily focused on basketball and cheerleading. If they do happen to be in a classroom, the only teacher they have is Coach Whitey.&quot;

Schwahn stated of the basketball element, &quot;A lot of times, the basketball games for us are like the crimes, or it&#x27;s the courtroom, the police precinct, or the medical operating arena – it was like our home turf.&quot; He said the other shows rarely focus on the court case or medical problem being dealt with, but are more about the people. &quot;For us, that&#x27;s what basketball was. It was never about playing basketball, but it was about what was happening to the people when this game or tournament was approaching.&quot;

In season 2, the basketball drama was completely removed from the series, as executives felt that the show was geared more toward a male audience. David Janollari, then entertainment president at The WB, attributed the show&#x27;s sophomore success partly to its shift in focus from a male-driven sports plot to expanding the stories of its girls. He felt they had time to &quot;step back and learn from audience response&quot; and that Schwahn tailored the show toward the &quot;core audience&quot;. Schwahn said, &quot;Girls watch the show in large numbers. [In the first season], the girls were sort of appendages to the boys.&quot; Show producer Joe Davola and Schwahn agreed with &quot;sex sells&quot; and &quot;skin to win&quot; sentiments for storyline directions. Less time on the basketball court could afford &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; more time for plots fueled by sex and drugs. Lack of basketball drama, however, meant a decrease in male viewership. In a 2006 interview, Schwahn said, &quot;In the second TV season, we didn&#x27;t play any basketball, which was the rest of their junior year, and I felt that the show suffered a little bit.&quot;

===Romance===
Schwahn made Lucas and Peyton&#x27;s love story a central theme of the show, saying he &quot;designed a world where Peyton and Lucas were meant to be together&quot; and that &quot;the seeds were planted for [Lucas] to pick Peyton in the pilot – in [that] first episode ... When Lucas is at the Rivercourt at the end of that pilot, you know. I think we feel like this is the girl [who] is his soulmate. And, you know, the pilot ends with him saying, &#x27;I&#x27;ll be seeing you.

Lucas and Peyton have been referred to as star-crossed. Schwahn described the theme of their relationship as &quot;two kids that carry around the weight of the world quite a bit. Can they agree together to let go of that weight? The theme for Lucas and Peyton is, &#x27;How do you learn to be happy when you&#x27;ve spent so much time carrying grief around? Do you feel guilty for being happy? Is it OK to let it go? The couple was also given theme music to enhance the scenes where Lucas rescues Peyton (from despair, dangerous situations, or herself). The theme, titled &quot;Saving Peyton&quot;, was composed by John Nordstrom and first heard in the school shooting episode &quot;With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept&quot;, in which Lucas strives to save a dying Peyton.

Making Lucas and Peyton the central love story created a rivalry between their fans and those who would prefer him to be with or end up with Brooke. &quot;[These] are two very passionate camps. And don&#x27;t think I don&#x27;t know it,&quot; stated Schwahn. &quot;I think sometimes one camp thinks they&#x27;re being ignored.&quot; Schwahn said that although he designed Lucas and Peyton to be together from the start, this did not preclude Brooke and Lucas ending up together, and that he was aware of the &quot;great chemistry&quot; between their portrayers, real-life ex-spouses Murray and Bush. He was not stubbornly holding on to the idea of [Lucas and Peyton]. He also denied some speculation according to which Murray and Bush&#x27;s divorce affected the writing in regard to the love triangle&#x27;s resolution, confirming that every decision concerning Brooke and Lucas&#x27; relationship (and thus also their definitive break-up) was made independently and regardless of the actors&#x27; private issues. Schwahn said the Peyton-Lucas-Brooke love triangle is also by design and became a staple of the show. &quot;There is a huge fanbase dedicated to Brooke and Lucas, and sometimes [those people] feel a bit betrayed, just as the fanbase dedicated to Peyton and Lucas felt betrayed [in season 2 and parts of season 3]&quot;, said Schwahn. &quot;That tells me that we&#x27;ve done things correctly – that&#x27;s the strength of a love triangle.&quot;

One debate concerned the season 2 episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me For Granted&quot;, in which Lucas says that a girl is &quot;slipping away&quot; and he needs to confess his love for her, but shows up at Brooke&#x27;s house instead of Peyton&#x27;s. Most viewers (including Lucas–Peyton and Brooke–Lucas fans) had trouble interpreting the &quot;slipping away&quot; line as a reference to Brooke, since Peyton had been the girl Lucas had been in love with in season 1 and the two had since become estranged. Sources cited fans as pondering four questions: When was Brooke slipping away? Did Lucas simply mean he did not want to lose her? Was it a plot device to make it seem like Peyton? Or was it Peyton? Speculation that Murray and Bush&#x27;s marriage affected Lucas&#x27;s sudden and forced change of heart was also discussed. Schwahn stated:

The show&#x27;s other prominent romantic pairing, Nathan and Haley, also garnered considerable fan and media attention along with Lucas and Peyton. James Lafferty, Nathan&#x27;s portrayer, said, &quot;Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an &#x27;ace in the hole&#x27; the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn&#x27;t know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I&#x27;m not really sure why.&quot; However, Lafferty has said that there is a genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: &quot;It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it&#x27;s a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think that people really enjoy to watch.&quot; Schwahn called the couple &quot;gold&quot; and said, &quot;I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well.&quot; He said that Nathan and Haley&#x27;s fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. &quot;They have a lot of obstacles come their way,&quot; said Schwahn, &quot;but I see them growing – especially with the jump [the four years that elapse between seasons 4 and 5] ahead and aging them a little bit – I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family.&quot;

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Digital Spy&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the series as one of the greatest teen dramas of all time, while &quot;TheWrap&quot; named it one of the shows that can be watched at any age.

The first season received mixed reviews. Critics compared it to &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, but with a more masculine appeal. &quot;Where &quot;Dawson&#x27;s&quot; was about relationships, especially between boys and girls, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; tries to be about masculinity, especially as negotiated through sports&quot;, wrote Tracy McLoone of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, who predicted that, despite this, it would probably be pinned as a girl&#x27;s show. &quot;This doesn&#x27;t mean boys won&#x27;t watch it, just that they won&#x27;t talk about it.&quot; Allison McCracken of flowtv.org, on the other hand, called it a &quot;boy soap opera&quot;, saying, &quot;The new boy-centered soap employs &#x27;feminine&#x27; generic serial elements to explore male adolescence and relationships between males, often focusing around brothers or fathers &amp; sons&quot; and &quot;the boy soap is as pleasurable a text for female viewers as television offers today.&quot; Chris Carle of IGN said: &quot;&quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, like &quot;The O.C.&quot; is helping to infuse network television with a much-needed renaissance of teen drama. The series is a bit less fun and more dramatic than Fox&#x27;s, and the themes and storylines hold a little more gravity than &quot;The O.C.&#x27;s&quot; sometimes soap opera dynamic, but it&#x27;s a solid show.&quot; Keith Helinski of Moviefreak.com disagreed with &quot;The O.C.&quot; comparisons, feeling that &quot;Summerland&quot; is similar to &quot;The O.C.&quot; with its &quot;scenarios and settings, while &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; is more suited as a &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; knock off.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called the show &quot;a slick prime-time drama about a small town packed with hunky teenagers and simmering family secrets,&quot; while &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; said it was &quot;a welcome surprise ... Every choice it makes from pacing to photography to music seems just about right, and the casting is inspired.&quot; Alynda Wheat of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the show a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; and said they had not had one &quot;this guilty&quot; since &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, adding that the characters&#x27; relationships change quickly. However, Wheat criticized the lack of parents in most of the teenage characters&#x27; lives. &quot;Any time order threatens to reign, the writers ship out the parents – to Italy, a boating accident, whatever,&quot; said Wheat. AOL TV placed the show in its list of TV&#x27;s Biggest Guilty Pleasures. Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it said that while the show has all the elements that make for a good show about teenagers/young adults, &quot;it&#x27;s also a show that has stubbornly refused to be categorized merely as a guilty pleasure and its myriad artistic pretensions – Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;-spewing narration, Peyton&#x27;s (Hilarie Burton) pedantic lectures on indie rock, countless expositional monologues lifted from a Philosophy 101 lecture—have often rendered it merely bad, rather than so-bad-its-good&quot;. Fienberg did, however, compliment the school shooting episode. Cynthia Boris of DVD Verdict, on the other hand, said, &quot;&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; doesn&#x27;t claim to be anything more than it is. They acknowledge that they&#x27;re a teen fantasy complete with an appropriately emo WB soundtrack.&quot; Ginia Bellefante of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the show&#x27;s lack of insight into the consequences of teenage pregnancy, stating that &quot;the show displays an almost aggressive aversion to moralizing about teenage pregnancy&quot; and that by &quot;refusing to lay out the grim consequences of premature motherhood, it seems as if it wants to make fans on either end of the political spectrum stick their heads in fiery hampers&quot;. Author Emily B. Anzicek said that pregnancy seems to be the only possible physical consequence for the residents of One Tree Hill and that discussion of STDs is non-existent, criticizing the &quot;potential threat&quot; due to the amount of promiscuity, such as several characters having sex with people they hardly know. &quot;Of all the episodes in the first three seasons, there are two mentions of condoms. One happens when Deb catches Brooke and Lucas at the drug store buying condoms and whipped cream&quot;, said Anzicek. &quot;The second happens in season two when Brooke throws a wedding reception for Nathan and Haley and decorates the room with condoms blown up like balloons.&quot; Anzicek said the teenagers, who are only supposed to be sixteen and seventeen at this time, are presented as very sexually experienced, especially Brooke, and that the one exception is Haley. Ian Arbuckle of CHUD.com complimented the series on its musical aspects and flexibility, feeling that &quot;&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; is firmly couched in both the pop television and pop music traditions&quot; and that the show &quot;doesn&#x27;t focus exclusively on the teenagers, but also stretches out to include dedicated subplots for their parents and other adults.&quot; Chris Carle of IGN said, &quot;Like the series itself, the offering is a little more adult (read: adult contemporary) and a little less fresh than other similar soundtracks. It&#x27;s not without its standouts, but overall the selection is plucked from the lighter fare on alt rock radio.&quot; Arbuckle stated that the show adds division between the teenagers and adults by having the teenagers focus on love and the adults focus on revenge. One of the audience&#x27;s main concerns had been which girl Lucas would end up with. Writing for DVD Verdict, Neal Solon commended the series&#x27; first season for being about more than betrayal and questionable morals, and instead highlighting the impact of the parents&#x27; mistakes on the teenagers&#x27; lives, which was something he identified as lacking in other teen shows. He felt that the season 1 finale was strong partly because its creators did not know if the WB would renew the show. &quot;The last few episodes bring some form of closure to the major story arcs, while leaving the door wide open for further development should the show continue. It is an artfully employed strategy that paid off&quot;, he said.

Although the second season was the show&#x27;s highest-rated, it was criticized in terms of quality. The complaints included the loss of basketball, confusion created about the Peyton–Lucas–Brooke love triangle, stereotypical backstabbing and plotting and Dan being turned into an almost cartoon-ish villain. Arbuckle said, &quot;Dan is a jealous man, and the writers come dangerously close to making him nothing more than an evil man.&quot; Amy Kane of Film.com called the character &quot;the most ridiculous villain never to twirl a mustache&quot;. Although Arbuckle called the plot-level elements satisfying, he criticized the dialogue, saying that the writers fail to convince with the slang or Black English of the teenagers, or the language of businessmen. He credited male viewers with watching partly for the physically attractive girls. One of the more complimented additions to season 2 was character Anna Taggaro, credited by AfterEllen.com as the first recurring bisexual character of color on television; some fans, however, debated whether the character was bisexual or gay.

TheCinemaSource.com said the show&#x27;s third season dialogue is &quot;clever and sarcastic from the last word of a scene to the very first of the next&quot; and complimented &quot;Dan&#x27;s witty comeback lines&quot;.

By the fourth season, the show had shifted to melodrama.

The fifth season&#x27;s timeline skip, showing the characters in their lives after high school and college, was successful, and is thought to have successfully avoided jumping the shark; viewership also returned to an all-time high. BuddyTV&#x27;s Don Williams said, &quot;The fifth season of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; completely reinvented the series. ... It was a risky move, but one that ultimately paid off.&quot; Conversely, Ginia Bellefante of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;Not one of the newly minted 22-year-olds on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; blogs or dresses coolly or speaks cleverly or gives any indication of having learned anything at all in college.&quot; She characterized the portrayal of twenty-somethings as &quot;so wildly inauthentic and unfamiliar as to make watching it feel like foreign correspondence&quot;, but added that the show was &quot;a no-arrogance, no-entitlement zone&quot; and that she was content to continue watching it.

===U.S. television ratings===
The series premiere was watched by 2.5million viewers and achieved a 1.9 Adults 18–49 rating on September 23, 2003. The following week, it rose to 3.3million and a 2.4 demographic, becoming one of the three shows to rise in its second episode in the 2003–2004 TV season.

The CW only attracts a fraction of the audience its competitors do. &quot;So the strategy is super-serving a young coveted demographic. The network&#x27;s sweet spot is women 18–34 and with a viewer median age of 33, it boasts the youngest audience among its broadcast competitors by almost a dozen years.&quot; Averaging about 4.3 million viewers weekly, season two was &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;&#x27;s highest-rated season. During this season, the show emerged as one of The WB&#x27;s hits. &quot;Of all the shows that they&#x27;ve launched in the last two years, this one has the most traction&quot;, said Stacey Lynn Koerner, at the time an executive vice president at Initiative, a media planning agency. &quot;It does have an audience it&#x27;s connecting with – a loyal audience that comes back week in and week out.&quot; The show was particularly popular among the young viewership. It became the first choice of prime-time television for teenage girls and was reported in January 2005 to be the program in Tuesday&#x27;s 9 pm time slot most viewed by women aged 12 to 34.

The series finale was the highest rated among women 18–34 (1.4/4) for The CW in more than a year. It was The CW&#x27;s best Wednesday night in adults 18–34 since premiere week which took place on September 14, 2011, and best adults 18–49 and women 18–49 ratings since December 7, 2011. Comparing to a year earlier, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;″s last episode was up 50% in adults 18–34, 40% in women 18–34 and 33% in adults 18–49. The first hour of the finale event, a series of interviews with the cast, garnered approximately 1.37million viewers, with 1.42million tuning in for the actual series finale.

Below are the seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; on The WB and The CW.

<doc id="999964" wikidata="Q6107680" url="?curid=999964" title="JANET NRS">
<text>The JANET NRS (&quot;Name Registration Scheme&quot;) was a pseudo-hierarchical naming scheme used on British academic and research networks in the 1980s. Its purpose was to organise and manage domain names within the JANET network, contributing to the establishment of computer networking familiarities at universities in the United Kingdom and other academic and research institutions. It used a reverse domain name notation. 

== History ==
It was proposed in 1983 and used until the superficially similar Internet Domain Name System (DNS) was fully adopted.

== Purpose and structure ==
The JANET NRS was developed to allocate and maintain unique domain names for organisations connected to the JANET network. Its primary purpose was to ensure a standardised and organised approach to domain name registration, facilitating identification and differentiation of institutions and their computer resources on the network.

NRS &quot;second-level domains&quot; consisted of (JANET academic and scientific sites), (commercial) and (Ministry of Defence). Any organisations not falling into these categories were given their own &quot;second-level&quot; name, e.g. (British Library) or (National Engineering Laboratory).

All NRS names had both a &quot;standard&quot; (long) and &quot;abbreviated&quot; (up to 18 characters) form. For example, was the less widely used standard equivalent of the abbreviated name .

For email, interoperability between the &quot;Grey Book&quot; email addressing style of and ARPA and USENET addresses of the style was achieved by way of mail gateway at University College London.

== Comparison with DNS ==
As Internet usage expanded and commercial entities emerged, the more general Domain Name System (DNS) superseded the NRS. A principal difference with the Domain Name System was that the order of significance began with the most significant part (so called big-endian addresses). Also, NRS names were canonically written in upper case. For example, the University of Cambridge had the NRS name , whereas its DNS domain is . 

After Internet top-level domains were introduced from 1984, confusion was caused when the least significant part of an Internet address matched the most significant part of an NRS address and vice versa. The ccTLD &quot;.cs&quot; for Czechoslovakia came into use around 1990-2 until 1995. The classic joke was that e-mail intended for UK universities ended up in Czechoslovakia, since many JANET e-mail addresses were of the form &quot;universityname&quot;, where &quot;CS&quot; stood for Computer Science (department).

Another significant difference from the DNS was the concept of context to name lookups, e.g. &#x27;mail&#x27; or &#x27;file transfer&#x27;. This made the NRS more sophisticated than the DNS, permitting overloading of names.

== Legacy ==
JANET transitioned to using Internet protocols in 1991, and by 1994 the DNS had become the de facto standard for domain names on JANET. The final mail gateway was taken out of service by the end of 1997. Nonetheless, the JANET NRS remains a significant part of the history of network infrastructure and academic networking in the UK. The one remaining legacy of the NRS is the convention of using .uk for the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD), rather than .gb as specified by ISO 3166. The UK was the only country with a pre-existing national standard.

<text>, officially abbreviated as Z.O.E., is a 2001 third-person shooter hack-and-slash video game that was developed and published by Konami for the Sony PlayStation 2. The game is based around mecha combat in outer space. Over the course of the game, the player obtains new weapons and has to protect towns from enemies.

The story is set in the space around Jupiter and follows a young colonist named Leo Stenbuck, one of the few survivors from his colony after it was attacked by the military force BAHRAM. The player controls the &quot;Orbital Frame&quot; known as Jehuty. Surviving using a mecha, Leo is on a mission to return Jehuty to the Space Force and uses the Frame to protect civilians. The game was created with the intention of having a more serious and realistic focus on the mecha genre. The mechas were designed by Yoji Shinkawa, the character and mechanical designer for the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series.

The critical reaction to &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; was positive. While the combat and graphics were generally well received, its short length and poor localization were the areas most commonly receiving criticism. The game spawned two follow-ups: &quot;The Fist of Mars&quot;, a spin-off for the Game Boy Advance, and &quot;The 2nd Runner&quot;, a direct sequel for the PlayStation 2. The Japanese animation studio Sunrise also produced two works related to &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot;. The game was re-released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 alongside its direct sequel, &quot;Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner&quot;, in October 2012 as part of the Zone of the Enders HD Collection.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; is a hack and slash and third-person shooter game in which the player takes the role of Leo Stenbuck, a child who becomes the pilot of the advanced mecha, or Frame, known as Jehuty. Jehuty is capable of three-dimensional movement, flying, and hovering. Leo uses Jehuty to traverse across different areas of a space colony orbiting Jupiter while attacking rogue Orbital Frames using its advanced weaponry. In some stages of the story, there is also the objective of minimizing damage to nearby buildings and civilians, encouraging more strategic combat. Players are given ranked depending on how many buildings and civilians were destroyed or spared. This grading affects the ending sequence outcome. Additionally, the player is given options to first take different areas where to fight in order to avoid linearity. In order to restore Jehuty&#x27;s health, an item known as Metatron Ore can be found and used in every area.

In battle, Jehuty locks-on to a single enemy Frame and is able to perform advanced maneuvers such as grabbing and throwing enemies, deploying an energy shield, and using booster jets to move quickly and dodge enemy attacks. It is equipped with an energy sword, an energy projectile, and various sub-weapons. As the player progresses, Jehuty&#x27;s arsenal grows and its abilities expand by obtaining programs alongside their respective code. Every time Jehuty defeats an enemy it gains experience; after gaining a determined amount of experience, it levels up, improving most of its qualities.

Upon completion of the game, a Versus Mode is unlocked. The player can use it to compete with the artificial intelligence (AI) bots or another player while controlling two Frames.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the year 2172; mankind has colonized Earth&#x27;s, Mars&#x27;, and Jupiter&#x27;s moons. A military force known as BAHRAM sends its primary offensive unit to attack Antilia, a Jupiter colony, in an attempt to secure two advanced machines known as Orbital Frames. One of the few colony survivors, a young boy named Leo Stenbuck, witnesses a falling Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle (LEV) killing his friends. He flees to a hangar, where he finds an Orbital Frame by the name of Jehuty. Using this suit and its built-in intelligence, A.D.A, he fends off the BAHRAM forces led by officer Viola who seeks to claim Jehuty on the orders of their leader, Nohman. Leo is then contacted by Elena Weinberg, the commander of the civilian transport vessel Atlantis; it belongs to Earth&#x27;s military forces, the United Nations Space Force. As Jehuty&#x27;s original pilot died during the attack, Elena requests Leo&#x27;s assistance to deliver Jehuty back to them so they can take it to Mars. Leo, however, refuses to kill enemies.

Battling through Antilia, Leo rescues civilians, including Celvice Klein, a friend; he defends the colony from destruction, defeating the BAHRAM forces and their commanders one by one. Before reaching Atlantis, Leo encounters Viola, who seeks a rematch; Leo defeats Viola and spares her. Later, Atlantis pilot Rock Thunderheart meets Leo in person, revealing that BAHRAM forces are still determined to obtain Jehuty and are threatening to destroy the colony. Thunderheart requests Leo&#x27;s help to pilot Jehuty, as he has realized Leo&#x27;s skills are superior. Viola then appears, shooting Celvice this time, forcing Leo to fight again. Celvice is taken by Thunderheart to be treated while Leo goes to save the colony.

Leo goes to the docks and Viola battles him once more. However, Viola is defeated again and killed when a leftover bomb blows her out of the colony and into Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere. Nohman himself then appears in Jehuty&#x27;s superior twin Frame Anubis, forcing Jehuty&#x27;s escape. As Jehuty is docking, A.D.A. reveals to Leo its programming: when taken to the fortress Aumaan on Mars, the mechas is to eject its pilot and self-destruct Jehuty, destroying the frame and the fortress. Leo leaves Jehuty&#x27;s cockpit and meets up with the crew of the Atlantis and Celvice, who survived a gunshot wound.

==Development==
&quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; entered development for the PlayStation and PC, but in actuality Konami had no intentions of releasing them for those platforms. Early prototypes of the game were built on Dreamcast. The game&#x27;s focus is on anime-style robots with an emphasis on realism compared to common sci-fi works. Development staff were advised by professionals who had done scientific research for other anime series. Director and scenario writer Noriaki Okamura wanted to write a serious story featuring people with complicated lives; its main theme examines the purpose and nature of life, as reflected in Leo&#x27;s hardships during the game. To support this message, multiple endings for the main narrative were avoided, although side quests could feature different endings. Despite this, two other endings can be unlocked depending on the player&#x27;s performance when protecting civilians. In contrast to other 3D games, the team worked to give players the sensation that they are controlling a fast robot; this demanded a year of camera work to achieve.

Okamura designed &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; to tell a story through gameplay sequences, rather than during cutscenes. As such, the staff focused on adding details such as the destroyed buildings to inform the player&#x27;s objectives. Character designer Nobuyoshi Nishimura expressed difficulties in designing characters who would both fit the mechas and the 3D models. In order to take advantage of the 3D space, Nishimura sought to move the camera as often as possible. He tried not to &quot;go overboard&quot; during cutscenes to emphasize the appeal of the mechas during gameplay. During development of the game, producer Hideo Kojima assisted the team.

Yoji Shinkawa was in charge of designing the Orbital Frames, the games mechas. Initially, the Frames were to feature unique transformations, but he determined that flying and skating with Jehuty was enjoyable on its own. As a joke, Shinkawa placed the cockpit in the Frames&#x27; crotch region. The staff first had the idea of naming a Frame Anubis based on Egyptian mythology; this led to the name Jehuty for the main Frame, a reference to the Egyptian deity, Djehuti. LEVs were intended to appear during the gameplay as weak, easy opponents that would target Jehuty and the Raptors; however, they ultimately appeared only during cutscenes.

&quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; was originally set to release in Japan on February 1, 2001, but was delayed to March 1, 2001. The Japanese edition premium package contains an original video animation titled &quot;;&quot; produced by Sunrise, it is set five years before the events on the game. Okamura was satisfied with Sunrise&#x27;s work, noting their experience in producing robot anime. During the animation&#x27;s production, Shinkawa suggested a design for the titular Frame, IDOLO, to ensure style continuity between the animation and the video game. The English versions of &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; were released on March 23, 2001 in Europe and March 28, 2001 in North America. They were originally sold packaged with a preview demo of the then-upcoming &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was released in Japan on April 25, 2001 by Konami Music Entertainment. According to director Okamura, the music is calm during normal situations, with new tracks added in combat situations to increase the complexity of the music while fighting. The main theme, &quot;Kiss Me Sunlights&quot;, was composed and performed by Heart of Air.

==Reception==

===&quot;Zone of the Enders&quot;===
The original &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Barber of &quot;NextGen&quot; called it &quot;a great action game that any gamer will surely enjoy. Unless you simply hate anything with mechs, this is one game you shouldn&#x27;t miss.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

The game&#x27;s fighting system was praised for its use of 3D camerawork and Jehuty&#x27;s fast movements. &quot;GamePro&quot; found it superior to the PlayStation 2&#x27;s other mecha game available contemporarily, &quot;Armored Core 2&quot; thanks to its responsive controls and quick combat. The visual design has also been praised as highly detailed. The game was critically acclaimed by Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot;, who remarked &quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; as one of the most appealing games and found its visuals as ones of the best ones ever found in the PlayStation 2 and added praise to its fighting. However, the presentation has been a major area of criticism; the game&#x27;s localization was criticized, with the English script being regarded as repetitive and the voice acting &quot;emotionless&quot; by David Smith, writing for &quot;IGN&quot;. He also reported being annoyed by Leo&#x27;s English voice acting. The story has been disliked by reviewers with Smith finding the main characters inferior to the ones from other mecha series such as &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; whereas Snackdawg of &quot;GameZone&quot; disliked the story as he stated that despite its dark parts such as the deaths of Leo&#x27;s friends, his father and his friend being shot, it instead made everyone &quot;simply seems whiny&quot;. While liking the game, Leeper recommended players to skip the cutscenes. Despite these complaints, Smith considered it one of the best mecha games he had ever played.

The combat was also considered too easy due to poor enemy AI, lack of variety, and an excessive number of tactical options, and the game has been found to be too short without an increase in challenge on higher difficulty settings. &quot;PSX Extreme&quot; writer Patrick Klepek criticized the game&#x27;s open ending, suggesting that the project had been rushed and that it would have been better to increase the game&#x27;s length and fill in missing plot elements. Shawn Sanders felt the game verged on being &quot;a better rental than purchase,&quot; but that the included &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; demo made the game worth buying. The versus mode was better received, with Shane Satterfield of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praising its competitiveness and its accentuation of the singleplayer campaign&#x27;s strengths with Klepek giving similar responses. On the other hand, &quot;GameZone&quot; criticized this mode stating it was not worth the wait to unlock it.

During 2001, it was the 81st bestselling game in Japan, with a total of 120,658 units sold. It was the sixth best selling game in North America during March 2001; sales were boosted by the inclusion of a demo for the highly-anticipated &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;.

The game was nominated for the &quot;Most Disappointing Game&quot; award at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2001 Awards, which went to &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;.

===Legacy===
In June 2001, Konami announced a spin-off game titled &quot;Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars&quot; for the Game Boy Advance to be developed by Sunrise Interactive. Sunrise also produced an animated television series titled &quot;Z.O.E. Dolores, I&quot; in 2001. Although there were no plans for a sequel to the original game, in May 2002, Konami announced &quot;Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner;&quot; it was released for the PlayStation 2 in February 2003. To bridge the two games, Konami published an intersequel following Leo&#x27;s activities with Atlantis and witnessing his growth as a pilot.

===&quot;HD Collection&quot;===
&quot;Zone of the Enders&quot; was ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 alongside &quot;The 2nd Runner&quot; as part of the &quot;HD Collection&quot; in 2012. A sequel to &quot;The 2nd Runner&quot; was announced in May 2012 as &quot;The Enders Project,&quot; but was cancelled a year later due to difficulty with the HD ports.

====Reception====
The Xbox 360 version of the &quot;HD Collection&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the PlayStation 3 version received above-average reviews, according to Metacritic.

<text>.tp was the listed Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for East Timor. The letters refer to &quot;Timor Português&quot; or Portuguese Timor, the name of the present independent nation when it was an overseas territory of Portugal. The domain .tp was officially launched in December 1997 by connect.ie, an internet service provider based in Dublin, Ireland, in cooperation with the East Timorese authorities in absentia, while East Timor was under Indonesian authority.

.tp remained active for the period of transition, although it now no longer complies with the ISO 3166-1 standard for the two-letter codes for the name of countries as the code for East Timor changed from TP to TL after independence. Regardless, it retained a number of domains until it was finally deleted in February 2015. The last listed change and update for .tp was on April 22, 2008.

==History==

In 1997, connect.ie discussed the potential of setting up a &quot;virtual East Timor&quot;. They communicated these ideas to the East Timorese leadership and their representatives. This set in motion the acquisition the .tp domain (then the only available official nomenclature for East Timor). After discussions with Jon Postel, IANA, it was realized that a set of necessary registration conditions would require to be met, including the provision of a local contact persons details. It was assumed by all parties in this discussion that there was a strong likelihood for a potential negative reaction to any person or indeed location listed for such purposes. After discussion with various East Timorese representatives, it was agreed that Xanana Gusmão, was at that time imprisoned in Jakarta, would be the appropriate contact person. The remaining issue and solution to providing local addressing and other contact details were provided by . A telephone call was made to Dili to identify the address and telephone number of the Military Governor, the last local location of Xanana Gusmão. These details were provided to and accepted by IANA. The .tp domain registry was successfully acquired and activated mainly for the purpose of &quot;declaring independence&quot; at least in the virtual world.

The subsequent attack on the .tp domain registry gained extensive worldwide media coverage and public support. Within 6 days of this occurring, and much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, Indonesian President Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie announced that a referendum would be held in East Timor to choose between special autonomy and independence. This activity finally concluded when East Timor became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century on May 20, 2002.

==First &quot;Internet&quot; War==
During the 1999 East Timorese crisis the cctld server services for the &#x27;.tp&#x27; domain were attacked by hackers believed to be at the behest and with support from a faction of the Indonesian military. Connect Ireland also received malicious telephone calls and other communications at this time.

==Confusion==
In August 1999, before the holding of the referendum, one of the independence leaders José Ramos-Horta, a former President of East Timor, was purported to have stated that arrangements had been made for hackers to attack Indonesian sites.

In response to these press reports, issued a statement in response to these purported reports condemning any use of hacking for any activity that would negatively impact on ordinary Indonesian citizens, stating that they (CI) were not at &quot;war&quot; with the Indonesian people and cited the support that they had received from many Indonesian people after the earlier attack on the .tp domain.

==Transition to .tl==
.tl is the ccTLD that now complies with the ISO 3166-1 standard. The Department of Information Technology in East Timor is working cooperatively with Connect Ireland to ensure a stable and secure transition to the .tl ccTLD. Existing registrants in the .tp ccTLD were initially granted the same domain in the .tl ccTLD at no cost for the first year of registration. Both the .tp and .tl &quot;versions&quot; continue to resolve and registrant information, whois data, and name server delegations were to be the same for both .tl and .tp, for legacy domains.

As of June 2005, no further registrations were accepted in the .tp domain.

Registration in .tl is available directly at second-level with no local presence requirement, through CoCCA and various resellers worldwide.

In 2008, search engines found approximately twice as many pages in the .tp domain as in its successor, .tl . By October 2009, this ratio dropped to 1:8, .tl being the more dominant. As of 2013, the same metric reached an insignificant 1:10000 in favour of .tl.

In 2015, the TLD was deactivated.

==Dated IANA information==
For a long time, according to the IANA site, .tl was listed as unassigned, with .tp still being listed for East Timor (Xanana Gusmão, a major political figure and former president, is the administrative contact). The Department of Information Technology in East Timor sent a letter to IANA requesting that this information be updated. As of September 30, 2005, the update had been made and .tl is listed as an active top-level domain.

<text>The Wrecking Crew, also known as the Clique and the First Call Gang, was a loose collective of American session musicians based in Los Angeles who played on many studio recordings in the 1960s and 1970s, including hundreds of top 40 hits. The musicians were not publicly recognized at the time, but were viewed with reverence by industry insiders. They are now considered one of the most successful and prolific session recording units in history.

Most of the players had formal backgrounds in jazz or classical music. The group had no official name in its early years, and when the name the Wrecking Crew was first used is a subject of contention. The name was in common use by April 1981 when Hal Blaine used it in an interview with &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;. The name became more widely known when Blaine used it in his 1990 memoir, attributing it to older musicians who felt that the group&#x27;s embrace of rock and roll was going to &quot;wreck&quot; the music industry.

The unit coalesced in the early 1960s as the de facto house band for Phil Spector and helped realize his Wall of Sound production style. They became the most requested session musicians in Los Angeles, playing behind recording artists including Jan and Dean, Sonny &amp; Cher, the Mamas and the Papas, the 5th Dimension, Frank Sinatra, and Nancy Sinatra. The musicians were sometimes used as &quot;ghost players&quot; on recordings credited to rock groups, such as the Byrds&#x27; debut rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; (1965), the first two albums by the Monkees, and the Beach Boys&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

The Wrecking Crew&#x27;s contributions went largely unnoticed until the publication of Blaine&#x27;s memoir and the attention that followed. The keyboardist Leon Russell and the guitarist Glen Campbell became popular solo acts, while Blaine is reputed to have played on more than 140 top-ten hits, including approximately 40 number-one hits. Other members included the drummer Earl Palmer, the saxophonist Steve Douglas, the guitarist Tommy Tedesco, and the keyboardist Larry Knechtel, who became a member of Bread. Blaine and Palmer were among the inaugural &quot;sidemen&quot; inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Wrecking Crew was entirely inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. In 2008, they were the subject of the documentary &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

==Historical context==
===Recording practices in the 1960s===
In the era when the Wrecking Crew was in demand, session players were usually active in local recording scenes concentrated in cities such as New York City, Nashville, Memphis and Detroit, as well as Los Angeles, the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s base of operations, and smaller specialist recording locations such as Muscle Shoals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Memphis/Nashville/Muscle Shoals&quot;&gt;Source A: Source B: Source C: &lt;/ref&gt; Each local scene had its circle of &quot;A-list&quot; session musicians, such as the Nashville A-Team that played on numerous country and rock hits of the era, the two groups of musicians in Memphis, the Memphis Boys and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s with the Memphis Horns, the musicians who backed Stax/Volt recordings, and the Funk Brothers in Detroit, who played on many Motown recordings.

At the time, multi-tracking equipment, though common, was less elaborate, and instrumental backing tracks were often recorded &quot;hot&quot; with an ensemble playing live in the studio. Musicians had to be available &quot;on call&quot; when producers needed a part to fill a last-minute time slot. Los Angeles was then considered the top recording location in the United States; consequently, studios were constantly booked around the clock, and session time was highly sought after and expensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazzWax (Byrds/studio expense)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Songs had to be recorded quickly in the fewest possible takes. In this environment, Los Angeles producers and record executives had little patience for needless expense or wasted time and depended on the service of reliable standby musicians who could be counted on to record in a variety of styles with minimal practice or takes, and deliver hits on short order.

===Musical backgrounds===
The Wrecking Crew were the &quot;go to&quot; session musicians in Los Angeles during this era. Its members were musically versatile but typically had formal backgrounds in jazz or classical music, and were exceptional at sight reading. The talent of this group of &quot;first call&quot; players was used in almost every style of recording, including television theme songs, film scores, advertising jingles and many genres of American popular music from the Monkees to Bing Crosby. Several of the Los Angeles recording studios in which the Wrecking Crew regularly appeared were Gold Star Studios, United Western Recorders built by Bill Putnam, Capitol Records&#x27; studios located at their tower on Vine Street, Columbia Records&#x27; Los Angeles complex, and the RCA recording facility, which was located on Sunset Boulevard near Wallichs Music City, a music store that often supplied instruments for L.A. session players. Like all session musicians who worked in Los Angeles, the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s members belonged to the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), Local 47, which represented their interests in areas such as pay scale and enforcement of regulations.

===Name===
The name &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; was popularized by drummer and member Hal Blaine in his 1990 memoir, &quot;Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew&quot;. Though the unit did not have an official moniker during their years of activity, Blaine has stated that the term was sometimes used disparagingly in the early 1960s by members of the industry&#x27;s old guard of &quot;coat and tie&quot; session players, who felt that, with their penchant for wearing &quot;t-shirts and jeans&quot; to sessions and their embrace of rock and roll, they were going to &quot;wreck&quot; the music industry. According to biographer Kent Hartman, &quot;Some of the studio musicians I interviewed swear they heard it applied to themselves as early as 1963; others say it was later. One says it was never used at all.&quot; Blaine&#x27;s memoirs, and the attention that followed, cast new light on the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s role in many famous recordings.

Guitarist and bassist Carol Kaye has disputed Blaine&#x27;s account of the name and stated, &quot;We were never known as that. Sometimes we were called &#x27;the Clique&#x27;, but &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot; is a Hal Blaine invented name for his own self-promotion in 1990 ...&quot; Songfacts stated: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t find any references to &#x27;The Wrecking Crew&#x27; in any publications from the era.&quot; In response to Kaye&#x27;s contention, Blaine denied that anyone had ever heard the name &quot;The Clique&quot;.

==Formation of unit: 1957–1962==

The beginnings of the group can be traced to session musicians of the late 1950s including Irv Cottler, Earl Palmer, Howard Roberts, Hal Blaine and a group headed by bassist and guitarist Ray Pohlman, sometimes referred to as the &quot;First Call Gang&quot;. Earl Palmer was originally from New Orleans and had recorded with many of the Crescent City&#x27;s rhythm and blues musicians, such as Fats Domino. He moved to Los Angeles in 1957, and in the 1960s played on hit records by artists such as Ike and Tina Turner, Glen Campbell, Jan and Dean, the Righteous Brothers, the Beach Boys, the Ronettes, the Everly Brothers, and Sonny &amp; Cher. Pohlman was one of the first session musicians in Los Angeles to use an electric bass in recordings, and by the early 1960s became highly sought after in rock recordings, playing on many records by Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys.

In 1962, Phil Spector started a new label, Philles Records, and recorded the song &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;, which would be credited to the Crystals. He enlisted the aid of his high-school friend, saxophonist Steve Douglas, who was also working as a contractor in charge of recruiting musicians for recording sessions. Douglas helped him corral the backing unit, which included Pohlman, guitarists Roberts and Tommy Tedesco, pianist Al De Lory, upright bassist Jimmy Bond, and Hal Blaine on drums. They booked Studio A at Gold Star Studios, known for its deeply reverberant echo chambers, which became the preferred recording facility for Spector. The unit became an essential component in developing his &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; style, starting with &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; and a series of several more hits by the Crystals (&quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot;) and other girl groups, such as the Ronettes (&quot;Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot;). It was on these recordings that the Wrecking Crew emerged in their most recognizable form and became the most coveted session players in Los Angeles&#x27;s thriving recording scene. With them, Spector went on to produce other records by the Righteous Brothers (&quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&quot;, &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;, and &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;) and Ike and Tina Turner (&quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;).
==Peak years: 1963–1971==
After Spector, the Wrecking Crew worked with dozens of producers, such as Brian Wilson, Terry Melcher, Lou Adler, Bones Howe, Jimmy Bowen, and Mike Post. As side players, they were teamed with artists as diverse as Jan &amp; Dean, Bobby Vee, Nancy Sinatra, the Grass Roots, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Glen Campbell, the Partridge Family, David Cassidy (in his solo work), the Carpenters, John Denver and Nat King Cole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niesel (Scene/Artits/Crew)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this heady period the unit worked long hours—15-hour days were not unusual—and were paid exceedingly well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jagger (Crew/15-hrs)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Kaye commented, &quot;I was making more money than the President.&quot;

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys produced and co-wrote many of his band&#x27;s most famous tracks and used the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s talents extensively in the mid-1960s, including on songs such as &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;, &quot;California Girls&quot;, and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; as well as the albums &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartman (Beach Boys/Crew/Esquire)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports falsely claim that the Wrecking Crew replaced the Beach Boys on record after their first few hits; however, this misconception derived from incomplete written documentation of the recording sessions. After audio documentation surfaced, it was revealed that the Beach Boys&#x27; first ten albums leading up to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; were, by and large, self-contained efforts, and the band members played instruments on most of their singles and key album tracks. It was not until the 1965 album &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; that Wrecking Crew musicians began to figure heavily on the band&#x27;s studio recordings, an arrangement that lasted until 1967.

Members of the Wrecking Crew served as &quot;ghost players&quot; on the first single by the Byrds, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, because Columbia Records—namely, producer Terry Melcher—did not feel that the group (except for Roger McGuinn, who played guitar on the single) were seasoned enough to deliver the kind of perfect take needed, particularly in light of the limited time and budget allocated to the newly signed and unproven group—on a label that was only just beginning to embrace rock.

Lou Adler was one of Los Angeles&#x27; top music executives and produced records by acts such as Jan and Dean and the Mamas &amp; the Papas, which were often backed by the Wrecking Crew, as on &quot;California Dreamin&quot; and &quot;Monday, Monday&quot;. Bones Howe had worked as an engineer under Adler and used the Wrecking Crew when he produced hits by the Association (including &quot;Windy&quot;, &quot;Everything That Touches You&quot;, and &quot;Never My Love&quot;) and the 5th Dimension (including &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;, and &quot;Aquarius&quot;).

Sonny and Cher recorded several Wrecking Crew-backed hits including &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, which were produced by Sonny Bono, who had previously worked as Phil Spector&#x27;s aide. Many of Cher&#x27;s solo records in the 1960s and early 1970s featured the backing of the Wrecking Crew, such as &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot; produced by Snuff Garrett in 1971. Jimmy Bowen produced Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; in 1966 and Mike Post produced Mason Williams&#x27; 1968 hit &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, both of which were backed by members of the Wrecking Crew.

Wrecking Crew members backed the Everly Brothers on their &quot;The Hit Sound of the Everly Brothers&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Everly Brothers Sing&quot; (1968) albums.

Rick Nelson used many Wrecking Crew members in various combinations, mostly during the mid-1960s, including Earl Palmer, Joe Osborn, James Burton, Tommy Tedesco, Howard Roberts, Billy Strange, Al Casey, Dennis Budimir, Glen Campbell, Don Randi, Mike Melvoin, Ray Pohlman, Chuck Berghofer, Victor Feldman, Frank Capp, and Jim Gordon.

==Musicians==
===Bass, drums, and percussion===
Carol Kaye provided an exception to the predominantly male world of Los Angeles session work in the 1960s. Originally a guitarist, she began doing session work in Los Angeles in the late 1950s, playing behind Ritchie Valens on &quot;La Bamba&quot; and in the 1960s becoming a regular contributor on Phil Spector&#x27;s recordings as well as on Beach Boys songs, such as &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and their subsequent &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; LPs. Ray Pohlman, who had assumed an early leadership position in the Wrecking Crew, became the musical director for the &quot;Shindig!&quot; TV show in 1965, resulting in reduced studio work from that point on. After Pohlman&#x27;s move to television, Kaye increasingly concentrated on the electric bass, becoming one of the few female &quot;first call&quot; players on the L.A. scene. She supplied the signature bass line in Sonny and Cher&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; released in 1967. Kaye was often teamed with Pohlman on pop music sessions (e.g. those for the Beach Boys) since it was a common practice at that time to reinforce the sound by &quot;doubling&quot; certain instruments like the bass, and producers and arrangers often recorded the bass parts with an acoustic and an electric bass playing together. Kaye would become known as one of the most prolific and widely heard bass guitarists, playing on an estimated 10,000 recordings in a career spanning more than 50 years.

Joe Osborn played bass on numerous Wrecking Crew-backed songs, such as Glen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;, the Mamas &amp; the Papas&#x27; &quot;California Dreamin, Richard Harris&#x27; &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, and the 5th Dimension&#x27;s &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;. Other notable electric bassists who played with the Wrecking Crew were Bill Pitman, Max Bennett, Red Callender, Chuck Rainey, and Bob West, as well as Jimmy Bond, Lyle Ritz, and Chuck Berghofer, who played acoustic upright bass.

Drummer Earl Palmer contributed to a handful of hits in the 1960s with the Wrecking Crew, including Phil Spector-produced tracks such as Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin in 1964, and Ike and Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; in 1966. Hal Blaine, with his abundance of musical skills, personality, and charisma, is also mentioned as having a prominent role in the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s success during their heyday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller (Blaine/Palmer)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had played primarily big band and jazz, he took a job in Tommy Sands&#x27; rockabilly group in the late 1950s, discovering a newfound appreciation for rock and roll, which by the beginning of the new decade led to session work in Los Angeles studios, where he became acquainted with Earl Palmer and saxophonist Steve Douglas. Blaine played on Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1961 hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he began playing on sessions for Phil Spector, quickly becoming the producer&#x27;s preferred drummer, and, along with Earl Palmer, became one of the two top session drummers in Los Angeles. Blaine is reputed to have played on over 140 top ten hits including approximately 40 No. 1 hits, such as &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; by Sonny &amp; Cher, &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot; by the Byrds, and &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; by Frank Sinatra, as well as numerous others and has been mentioned by Drummerworld as perhaps the most prolific recording drummer in history. Jim Gordon began as an understudy of Blaine, but with the passage of time emerged as a first call player in the Wrecking Crew, playing on parts of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album and on hits such as &quot;Classical Gas&quot; and &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;.

Other drummers who played in the Wrecking Crew were Frank Capp, John Clauder, Forrest Draper and Joe Porcaro. Gary Coleman played vibraphone and a variety of percussion instruments and contributed to works such as the soundtrack of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; and Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; album. Some of the other Wrecking Crew percussionists were Julius Wechter, Milt Holland, Gene Estes, and Victor Feldman. Drummer Jim Keltner is sometimes mentioned in connection with the Wrecking Crew, because he befriended Hal Blaine in the 1960s and would later play with the Wrecking Crew on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; album recorded in 1973, but he is more often associated with the later generation of session players who eclipsed the Wrecking Crew in terms of popularity during the 1970s.

===Guitars and keyboards===

Guitarist and sometimes bassist Bill Pitman factored prominently in much of the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s work. For a brief time in the late 1950s he provided guitar lessons for a young Phil Spector, before Spector formed the Teddy Bears, who went on to record the surprise hit &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot; in 1958. Pitman ended up playing on Spector-produced records in the 1960s such as &quot;Be My Baby&quot; by the Ronettes. He can be heard on numerous hits from the period such as &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)&quot; by Jan &amp; Dean, and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; by the Byrds. Tommy Tedesco, born in an Italian family in Niagara Falls, New York, was another one of the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s most renowned guitarists, playing along with Pitman on &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)&quot;, as well as on the Champs &quot;Limbo Rock&quot;. He provided the flamenco-influenced guitar licks in the 5th Dimension&#x27;s &quot;Up and Away&quot; as well as the guitar intro to the popular &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; theme. Billy Strange was one of the top guitarists with the Wrecking Crew and played on hits such as &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)&quot; and the Beach Boys&#x27; version of &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. In addition to playing sessions in Memphis, guitarist James Burton often recorded with the Wrecking Crew in Los Angeles in the 1960s.

Though Glen Campbell became better known as a highly successful country music artist in his own right, he played guitar in the Wrecking Crew during the 1960s and appeared along with them on several of the Beach Boys&#x27; classics of the period such as &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;Help Me Rhonda&quot;. He and Hal Blaine appeared as members of Steve McQueen&#x27;s character&#x27;s band in the film &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; (1965) featuring an extremely clear moment of Campbell standing behind McQueen, but both Campbell and Blaine were uncredited in the film. In 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, and in 1966 he and the Wrecking Crew played on the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. Campbell enlisted the Wrecking Crew as a backup unit on many of his own solo records during the 1960s, such as on &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, and on two songs written by Jimmy Webb, &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; and his single &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;.
The Wrecking Crew&#x27;s ranks included a circle of keyboardists who contributed piano and organ parts to many of the famous songs of the era. Larry Knechtel, later in Bread, was a multi-instrumentalist who played keyboards on &quot;California Dreamin, &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, as well as upright bass on &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; and electric bass on Byrds&#x27; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Mike Melvoin, a classically trained pianist with an English degree from Dartmouth College, played organ and piano on many tracks on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, played organ on &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and performed on keyboards on many of the sessions for the Beach Boys&#x27; never-completed &quot;SMiLe&quot; album. Don Randi contributed the piano part on Barry McGuire&#x27;s 1965 hit &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot;. Before becoming a solo artist, Leon Russell was a regular member of the Wrecking Crew and played on the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, and Jan &amp; Dean&#x27;s &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena).&quot; New Orleans&#x27; Mac Rebennack (later Dr. John) did session work with the Wrecking crew while living in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. Mike (Michel) Rubini was the son of Jan Rubini, a classical violinist, and initially played concert piano, but later became enamored with R&amp;B and switched to playing popular music, eventually becoming a member of the Wrecking Crew and playing on hits such as Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;.

===Brass, woodwinds, harmonica, and backing vocals===
Saxophonist Steve Douglas, who attended Fairfax High School with Phil Spector in the 1950s, got a call in 1962 to play on Spector&#x27;s debut recording as a producer, &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;, and would, from then on, become a regular fixture with the Wrecking Crew. Years later, in 1978, Douglas played on Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1978 &quot;Street-Legal&quot; album and accompanied Dylan on tour that year as part of his eight piece backing band. Jim Horn played both saxophone and flute, and contributed parts to numerous tracks with Wrecking Crew, such as in the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. He played flute in the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and would later become a member of John Denver&#x27;s backing band. Plas Johnson provided the saxophone line in &quot;The Pink Panther Theme&quot; in the Champs&#x27; 1962 instrumental version of &quot;Limbo Rock&quot;. Nino Tempo, who along with his sister Carol (under her stage name April Stevens) had scored a U.S. number 1 hit song in 1963, &quot;Deep Purple&quot;, was also a member of the Wrecking Crew and played saxophone in the Ronettes&#x27; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; and later appeared on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; album.

Other saxophonists who played sessions with the Wrecking Crew were Jackie Kelso, Jay Migliori, Gene Cipriano, Bill Green, and Allan Beutler. On trombone were Richard &quot;Slyde&quot; Hyde, Lew McCreary, and Dick Nash and on trumpet Bud Brisbois, Roy Caton, Chuck Findley, Ollie Mitchell, and Tony Terran. Tommy Morgan played harmonica on Wrecking Crew-backed tracks such as &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)&quot;. When backing vocals were needed the Ron Hicklin Singers were called in.

==&quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; (1964)==
Several members of the Wrecking Crew played in the house band for 1964&#x27;s &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, which was captured on film and sent to theaters around the country. Seen in camera shots showing the right-hand side of the stage are musical director Jack Nitzsche, Hal Blaine, Jimmy Bond, Tommy Tedesco, Bill Aken, Glen Campbell, Lyle Ritz, Leon Russell, Plas Johnson, among others, all providing incidental music and backing for many of acts such as Chuck Berry, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and Lesley Gore.

==1970s–2010s==
===Diminished output===
The Wrecking Crew&#x27;s level of success could not be maintained indefinitely, and their services eventually fell out of demand. Kent Hartman cites several factors in the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s demise, beginning as far back as 1968 when the unit was at their peak of popularity: &quot;By the middle of 1968, popular music was changing once again. In fact it was getting downright heavy. In the aftermath of the recent Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. slayings, the bloody Tet Offensive in Viet Nam, and the ever-growing level of campus unrest at universities around the country, Top 40 radio gradually began to lose step with the times.&quot; Hartman mentions that the runaway success that year of Richard Harris&#x27; elaborate seven-minute epic hit, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, written by Jimmy Webb and featuring the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s intricate backing, might have been another seed in their eventual decline:

The Wrecking Crew remained in demand in the early 1970s, even enjoying several hits, but by the end of 1973 they began to experience a downturn in bookings, as a series of changes in the recording industry began to take hold. Unlike earlier bands/artists such as the Monkees, the Grass Roots, the Partridge Family and David Cassidy that often utilized the Wrecking Crew for backing tracks (and as a backing band for Cassidy&#x27;s earliest concert tours of America in 1971/2), rock groups in the early to mid 1970s began to stipulate in their recording contracts that they be allowed to play their own instruments on records. Younger session players such as Larry Carlton, Andrew Gold, Danny Kortchmar, Waddy Wachtel, Russ Kunkel, Jeff Porcaro, Leland Sklar, and Jim Keltner had a more contemporary sound, better-suited to the changing musical tastes of the decade. By the mid-1970s, technological advances such as 16-track and 24-track tape recording machines and automated large-format multi-channel consoles made it viable for instruments to be recorded, often close-miked, onto separate tracks individually, reducing the need to hire ensembles to play live in the studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rumsey/McCromick (70s record. auto.)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizers could approximate the sound of practically any instrument. Eventually, drum machines would become the norm, which could be specially programmed to keep beats in place of a drummer or be used for click tracks played in musicians&#x27; headphones, making it easier to overdub or re-record any part in-synch and achieve a more uniform and consistent tempo.

===Post–Wrecking Crew careers===
In 1969, after scoring hits as a solo artist such as &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Wichita Lineman&quot;, Glen Campbell left the Wrecking Crew. Carol Kaye, exhausted from the constant pressure of the L.A. recording scene, went on to other musical endeavors. According to guitarist Bill Pitman, &quot;You leave the house at seven o&#x27;clock in the morning, and you&#x27;re at Universal at nine till noon; now you&#x27;re at Capitol Records at one, you just got time to get there, then you got a jingle at four, then we&#x27;re on a date with somebody at eight, then the Beach Boys at midnight, and you do that five days a week ... jeez, man, you get burned out.&quot; Campbell went on to become one of country music&#x27;s most popular performers during the 1970s with hits such as &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; and the Allen Toussaint-penned &quot;Southern Nights&quot;.

By the mid-1970s many of the Wrecking Crew&#x27;s members scattered and drifted into different spheres. Some members, such as Carol Kaye, Tony Terran, Gary L. Coleman, Earl Palmer and Tommy Tedesco, switched to television and motion picture soundtrack work. Leon Russell and Mac Rebennack (as Dr. John) both went on to become successful solo artists and songwriters, enjoying hit singles and albums during the 1970s. Jim Keltner went on to a successful career as a session drummer for much of the 1970s–90s; he played in Ringo Starr&#x27;s All-Starr band and was the drummer on both albums by the supergroup Traveling Wilburys, where he is credited as &quot;Buster Sidebury&quot;. Beginning in 1973 he hosted a regular weekly jam session at Los Angeles clubs called &quot;the Jim Keltner Fan Club&quot; frequented by many of the younger L.A. session musicians of the time (Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, Waddy Wachtel, Leland Sklar, and Jeff and Steve Porcaro).

The unit did a brief, but ill-fated reunion session with Phil Spector in 1992. In 2001, members of The Wrecking Crew reunited in the studio with David Cassidy to recreate Cassidy&#x27;s hit songs from the 1970s, both solo and with The Partridge Family. These recordings resulted in the album &quot;Then and Now&quot; which was hugely successful internationally and went platinum in 2002. More recently, they backed Glen Campbell in his song &quot;I&#x27;m Not Gonna Miss You&quot; taken from the soundtrack of the 2015 documentary &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayers (Campbell/Crew)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Wrecking Crew backed dozens of popular acts and were one of the most successful groups of studio musicians in music history. According to Kent Hartman, &quot;... if a rock-and-roll song came out of an L.A. recording studio from between about 1962 and 1972, the odds are good that some combination of the Wrecking Crew played the instruments. No single group of musicians has ever played on more hits in support of more stars than this superbly talented—yet virtually anonymous group of men (and one woman).&quot; According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Wrecking Crew passed into a history that it largely created, imperfectly acknowledged but perfectly present in hundreds of American pop songs known to all.&quot; In 2008, the Wrecking Crew were featured in the documentary film &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, directed by Tommy Tedesco&#x27;s son, Denny Tedesco. In 2014, its musicians were depicted in the Brian Wilson biopic &quot;Love &amp; Mercy&quot; (playing the instrumental track Pet Sounds).

Two of their members, drummers Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer, were among the inaugural &quot;sidemen&quot; inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, and the entire Wrecking Crew was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2010, Blaine was elected into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame.

<text>Réaumur is the remains of a lunar impact crater located on the southern edge of Sinus Medii. Its diameter is 51 km. It was named after the 18th century French scientist René de Réaumur. It shares an eroded rim with the similar crater Oppolzer to the northwest. It lies to the northwest of the large walled plain Hipparchus, and east of Flammarion. To the south is Gyldén, and farther to the south-southwest is Ptolemaeus.

The rim of Réaumur is heavily eroded, and the northern half consists of little more than a series of low ridges in the mare. The southern rim is notched and indented by small crater impacts. The interior floor is relatively smooth and flat with no significant features.

The broken northern rim intersects a rille designated Rima Oppolzer. This feature is about 110 kilometers long and follows a course from the north-northeast to the south-southwest. To the east of the crater rim is a smaller rille designated Rima Réaumur. Farther to the east is the small Seeliger.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Réaumur.

<doc id="999973" wikidata="Q684901" url="?curid=999973" title="Gordon Persons">
<text>Seth Gordon Persons (February 5, 1902 – May 29, 1965) was an American Democratic politician who was the 43rd Governor of Alabama from 1951 to 1955. A relative moderate, Persons provided reforms to the state prison system, and limited poll tax reform, while expanding highway spending and creating the state&#x27;s educational television system. His term was relatively quiet, between the Dixiecrat revolt and the eve of the turbulent civil rights era.

==Early life and career==
Persons enrolled at Auburn University in 1921. While at Auburn, he served as president of the &quot;Hobo Club&quot; that traveled to away football games dressed as hobos. Persons studied electrical engineering, but left school after one year.

Persons held various jobs, working for the Farm Bureau and for IBM in Ithaca, New York, before returning to Montgomery to run a service station and open a radio parts store. In 1930, he and partner Howard Pill founded WSFA, Montgomery&#x27;s first radio station. Persons would go on to serve on the board of directors for the National Association of Broadcasters from 1935 to 1939, and as the chief radio consultant of the Office of War Information from 1942 to 1943.

In 1935, Persons was appointed by governor Bibb Graves as chairman of the state Rural Electrification Administration. Three years later, he opened his own engineering firm installing electrical lines; in addition to financial gain, he also won considerable popularity. After an unsuccessful run for the presidency of the Alabama Public Service Commission in 1940, he won election as an associate commissioner in 1942, and as president in 1944. He unsuccessfully campaigned for Governor in 1946, finishing last in the five-candidate Democratic primary.

==Governor of Alabama==
===1950 election===
Persons ran for Governor again in 1950, seeking to avoid conflict between the white supremacist Dixiecrat loyalists and the national Democratic party. While campaigning, Persons gained notoriety by touring the state in a two-seat helicopter, prompting one opponent to dub him &quot;the man from Mars&quot;. He won the Democratic nomination by defeating a crowded field that included former governor Chauncey Sparks. Owing to Democratic dominance of state politics, Persons was elected in November 1950 with nearly 91% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Persons sought to counter the bombastic nature of his predecessor and successor, Jim Folsom, with a no-nonsense, business-like approach. He declined an inaugural parade and ball, and took the oath of office in a simple business suit, rather than a formal top hat and coat. Persons and his family were the first to occupy the current Alabama Governor&#x27;s Mansion. His first official act as governor was to call a meeting of the Auburn University board to trustees to fire football coach Earl Brown and replace him with Shug Jordan.

Owing to good relations with the Legislature, Persons was able to institute a sweeping agenda. He reformed the prison system, placing it under a new supervisory board and ending fiscal mismanagement, and abolishing corporal punishment, deriding it as barbaric. He increased spending on highway construction, and imposed a 60 mile-per-hour speed limit, significantly reducing traffic fatalities. In 1953, Alabama created the Educational Television Commission (the predecessor of Alabama Public Television), becoming the first state in the nation to do so.

Persons also signed &quot;right-to-work&quot; legislation that limited union activity, and established new voting qualifications aimed at restricting African Americans. In the midst of McCarthyism, he also barred Communists from holding public office, and required them to register their party membership. Although he had campaigned on abolishing the poll tax, he compromised with the legislature on limiting unpaid poll taxes and eliminating them for older voters. Near the end of his term, the Supreme Court struck down segregation in schools in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling. Persons refused to convene a special session of the legislature, which would seek to maintain segregation.

In July 1954, Persons ordered the National Guard into Phenix City after the assassination of Attorney General-elect Albert Patterson.

Unable to run for a second consecutive term, Persons suffered a heart attack in November 1954, days before Folsom&#x27;s re-election. He never returned to office, and directed his secretary to read his farewell address to the legislature.

==Post-Governorship and death==
After leaving office as governor, Persons never sought statewide public office again. He was considered a frontrunner for the 1958 Alabama gubernatorial election, but a stroke prevented him from running. He died after another stroke on May 29, 1965.

==Legacy==
The Dauphin Island Bridge south of Mobile is formally named for him. The Gordon Persons Building is a six floor, 60,000 square foot state government office building in Montgomery that houses the state departments of Education, Revenue, and Human Resources.

<doc id="999974" wikidata="Q433723" url="?curid=999974" title=".yu">
<text>.yu was the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) that was assigned to SFR Yugoslavia in 1989 and was mainly used by Serbia and Montenegro and its two successor states. After Montenegro and Serbia acquired separate .me and .rs domains in 2007, a transition period started, and the .yu domain finally expired in 2010.

==History==

The .yu ccTLD was assigned originally to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, during the government project for the development of scientific-technological information (SNTIJ). The official registrants were the University of Maribor and the Jožef Stefan Institute, which were located in Slovenia. Computer scientist Borka Jerman Blažič registered the domain in 1989, which allowed Yugoslavia to have an Internet connection.

When the SFR Yugoslavia dissolved, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia registered their own ccTLDs (.si, .hr, .ba and .mk). Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but was under international sanctions at the time because of ongoing Yugoslav wars. Between 1992 and 1994, the domain was run by ARNES who only used it for email. ARNES rejected all requests by Serbian institutions for new domains, severely limiting the country’s access to the internet. The domain became a succession matter when the Slovenians refused to relinquish the domain name to the University of Belgrade in Serbia, which had requested they do so.

Following the personal intervention of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority founder Jon Postel, in 1994 IANA finally decreed that the domain should pass to FR Yugoslavia. After that, the domain was managed by the YUNET Association, an organization based in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Belgrade.

The FR Yugoslavia renamed itself Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003. The code YU was replaced by CS in July 2003 following the official name change, and the ccTLD .cs was reserved for Serbia and Montenegro after the name change. However, .cs was never actually used, and .yu remained one of the few ccTLDs that did not correspond to a current ISO 3166-1 two-letter code.

The state union of Serbia and Montenegro was dissolved in June 2006, and in September 2006, ISO accordingly proposed the replacement the codes RS for Serbia and ME for Montenegro. On 26 September 2006 the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency agreed on the change of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code CS to RS. The new domains .rs for Serbia and .me for Montenegro became active shortly thereafter.

In September 2007 ICANN resolved that the .yu domain would be operated temporarily under the Serbian National Register of Internet Domain Names (RNIDS), operators of the new .rs domain registry. A two-year transition period started, and the .yu domain was scheduled to expire on 30 September 2009. However, the Serbian registrar requested an extension and ICANN decided to extend the transition deadline another six months. Finally, the Serbian registrar declared the end of the .yu domain at 12:00 CEST on 30 March 2010. All .yu websites that failed to transition were deleted, including historical ones. 
RNIDS estimated there to have been around four thousand active websites using the .yu domain at the time of its deprecation.

==Former use of .yu domains==
All of the domains directly under .yu were reserved for legal entities only. Top level domain was reserved for federal institutions and official governmental institutions, as well as Internet service providers. The Serbian Orthodox Church was also allowed to use .yu domain.

The second-level domains under .yu included:

* Academic organizations, such as universities, used the .ac.yu domain. For example, the School of Electrical Engineering (ETF) at the University of Belgrade (BG) had the etf.bg.ac.yu domain.
* Educational institutions, such as primary and high schools, used the .edu.yu domain.
* Independent organizations used the .org.yu domain.
* Corporations used the .co.yu domain.
* The Government used the .gov.yu domain.

Montenegrin websites often used the .cg.yu subdomain which was given for free to customers of a Montenegrin ISP which controlled the domain, which made it a popular option for those who opted not to purchase a domain for their website.

== In the media ==
The domain is part of the story in the 2013 mini-documentary film &quot;From Yu to Me&quot;.

<doc id="999975" wikidata="Q560552" url="?curid=999975" title="Peter Mayhew">
<text>Peter William Mayhew (19 May 1944 – 30 April 2019) was a British actor. He was best known for portraying Chewbacca in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. He played the character in all of his live-action appearances from the 1977 original to 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; before his retirement from the role.

==Early life==
Peter Mayhew was born on 19 May 1944, in Barnes, Surrey. At the age of 8, he was diagnosed with gigantism. Mayhew also had a genetic tissue disorder called Marfan syndrome. His peak height was .

==Career==
===Early work===
Mayhew gained his first acting job when the producers of &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; (1977) discovered him from a photograph in a newspaper article about men with large feet, and cast him in the role of the Minoton.
===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
When casting the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), director George Lucas needed a tall actor who could fit the role of the hairy alien Chewbacca. He originally had in mind bodybuilder David Prowse, but Prowse chose to play Darth Vader. This led Lucas to cast Mayhew, who was working as a hospital orderly in the emergency department at Mayday University Hospital in Surrey. He became aware of a casting call for &quot;Star Wars&quot; which was filming at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. The tall actor was immediately cast as Chewbacca after he stood up to greet Lucas. Mayhew continued working as an orderly at the same hospital in between filming the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

Mayhew modelled his performance of Chewbacca after researching the behaviour of bears, monkeys and gorillas he saw at London Zoo. Lucas said Mayhew was &quot;the closest any human being could be to a Wookiee: big heart, gentle nature and I learnt to always let him win&quot;. The character did not have any lines, the sounds he made being derived from sound recordings of animal noises.

Mayhew played Chewbacca in five &quot;Star Wars&quot; films: the original trilogy (&quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;), &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. He played the role in the 1978 television film &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; and in a 1980 appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. He also recorded dialogue for the &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; Season 3 finale episode &quot;Wookiee Hunt&quot;.

Mayhew played the role in commercials and hospital appearances for sick children, and made numerous appearances as Chewbacca outside the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Mayhew, appearing as Chewbacca, was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the MTV Film Awards 1997.

He also made other media appearances outside of playing Chewbacca. He appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Identity&quot;, where his identity was based on his role as Chewbacca and was a frequent guest in the early days of &quot;Slice of SciFi&quot;.

While Mayhew portrayed Chewbacca in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, he was not in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; but was listed in the credits as &quot;Chewbacca Consultant&quot;. Mayhew retired from playing Chewbacca due to health issues. Joonas Suotamo shared the portrayal of Chewbacca with Mayhew in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, and then completely replaced him in subsequent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

===Other work===
Outside &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Mayhew appeared in the 1978 horror film &quot;Terror&quot;, directed by Norman J. Warren. In the English version of &quot;Dragon Ball GT: A Hero&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, he provided the voice for Susha. He also appeared in &quot;Yesterday Was a Lie&quot;.

===Books===
Mayhew wrote two books for younger audiences: &quot;Growing Up Giant&quot;, which explains that being different is a strength instead of a weakness, and the anti-bullying book for children &quot;My Favorite Giant&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Mayhew moved to Wheathead Lane, Keighley, West Yorkshire, in 1987. He invested in and worked at a timber yard just over the City of Bradford border in South Craven, North Yorkshire. He became a supporter of Keighley Rugby Union Football Club.

Mayhew married Mary Angelique &quot;Angie&quot; Luker (née Cigainero), a native of Texas, in 1999. The two lived in Boyd, Texas, United States, where he had moved to in 2000. Peter was the stepfather to Mary&#x27;s three children. It was reported that his wife would head his namesake charity, the Peter Mayhew Foundation.

Mayhew became a naturalised citizen of the United States in 2005 at a ceremony in Arlington, Texas. In an interview with the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, he joked that he did not get a medal at this ceremony either, a reference to the closing scene in &quot;Star Wars&quot; during which Luke Skywalker and Han Solo get medals, but Chewbacca does not. Mayhew noted in an MTV interview that although Chewbacca does not get a medal in the film, he does have the last line of dialogue, when he roars.

Mayhew underwent double knee replacement surgery in 2013, having been a full-time wheelchair user for the previous two years and still largely reliant on it at the time of filming &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. In July 2018, Mayhew announced via Twitter that he had successfully undergone unspecified spinal surgery to improve his mobility, and was recovering.

Mayhew died of a heart attack on 30 April 2019, at his home in Boyd, Texas, at age 74. He was buried in Reno, Parker County, Texas, in Azleland Memorial Park and Mausoleum.

<doc id="999978" wikidata="Q286167" url="?curid=999978" title="Reiner (crater)">
<text>Reiner is a lunar impact crater on the Oceanus Procellarum, in the western part of the Moon. It has a nearly circular rim, but appears oval in shape due to foreshortening. The rim edge is well-defined and has not been eroded by impacts. In the midpoint of the irregular crater floor is a central peak. Outside the rim is a hummocky that extends out across the mare for about half a crater diameter.

To the west-northwest of the crater on the Oceanus Procellarum is the unusual feature Reiner Gamma, a fish-shaped surface marking of ray-like material with a high albedo.

Reiner is a crater of Eratosthenian age. It is named after the astronomer Vincentio Reinieri, a disciple of Galileo Galilei.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Reiner.

<doc id="999980" wikidata="Q271491" url="?curid=999980" title="Greta Van Susteren">
<text>Greta Conway Van Susteren (born June 11, 1954) is an American journalist, lawyer, and television news anchor for Newsmax TV. She was previously on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. She hosted Fox News&#x27;s &quot;On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren&quot; for 14 years (2002–2016) before departing for MSNBC, where she hosted &quot;For the Record with Greta&quot; for roughly six months in 2017. On June 14, 2022, she began hosting &quot;The Record with Greta van Susteren&quot; on Newsmax. A former criminal defense and civil trial lawyer, she appeared as a legal analyst on CNN co-hosting &quot;Burden of Proof&quot; with Roger Cossack from 1994 to 2002, playing defense attorney to Cossack&#x27;s prosecutor. In 2016, she was listed as the 94th most powerful woman in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot;, up from 99th in 2015.

==Early life==
Greta Conway Van Susteren was born in Appleton, Wisconsin. Her father, Urban Van Susteren, was of Dutch descent. Her mother, born Margery Conway, was a homemaker of Irish descent. Van Susteren&#x27;s father was a longtime friend of future U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was best man at Greta&#x27;s parents&#x27; wedding. Urban Van Susteren, an elected judge, served as a campaign strategist for McCarthy but later broke with McCarthy.

Van Susteren&#x27;s sister, Lise, is a forensic psychiatrist in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2006, Lise was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate. Her brother, Dirk Van Susteren, was a journalist and long-time editor of the &quot;Vermont Sunday&quot; magazine, jointly published, until folding in 2008, by the &quot;Rutland Herald&quot; and the &quot;Barre Montpelier Times Argus&quot;.

Van Susteren graduated from Xavier High School in Appleton in 1972 and the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1976, where she studied geography and economics. She later earned a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1979 and prior to the start of her television work returned to Georgetown Law as an adjunct faculty member in addition to her full-time legal career. She was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Stetson Law School.

==Career==

During coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder trial, she appeared regularly on CNN as a legal analyst. This led to her stint as co-host of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Burden of Proof&quot; and &quot;The Point&quot;.

During the Clinton impeachment debate, Van Susteren dismissed the issue as one of an unfaithful husband, and not an impeachable offense.

In 2002, Van Susteren switched to the Fox News Channel after a highly publicized contract-bidding war. Before starting at Fox she also underwent cosmetic surgery that significantly changed her look. She hosted the current affairs show &quot;On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren&quot;.

On September 6, 2016, she resigned from Fox News. She was not able to say goodbye on-air, as the network immediately filled the &quot;On the Record&quot; anchor spot with Brit Hume. Van Susteren, who said that Fox &quot;has not felt like home to me for a few years,&quot; chose to take advantage of a clause in her contract that allowed her to resign from the network immediately: &quot;The clause had a time limitation, meaning I could not wait.&quot;

In early 2017, Van Susteren signed on with NBC News to anchor the 6 p.m. ET program on its 24-hour cable news channel, MSNBC. The program, titled &quot;For the Record with Greta&quot;, launched on January 9, 2017. On June 29, 2017, according to Van Susteren on Twitter, she was &quot;out at MSNBC&quot; as her new program did not do well in ratings.

In October 2017, Van Susteren joined Voice of America as a contributor.

In February 2019, Van Susteren joined Gray Television, a large group of television stations, as its chief national political analyst out of Gray&#x27;s Washington bureau, providing commentary and analysis to the newscasts airing on Gray&#x27;s 140+ stations. She was also developing two nationally syndicated shows for the company. In April 2019, Van Susteren and Gray announced &quot;Full Court Press with Greta Van Susteren&quot;, a Sunday morning talk show, which would begin airing on most Gray stations in September 2019, along with Weigel Broadcasting stations in Chicago and Milwaukee. With Gray stations in Iowa and South Carolina, the program hoped to get candidate interviews for such early election primary states. The program planned to roll out &quot;Full Court Press-Overtime&quot;, a website and associated app with additional content and user feedback.

In May 2022, it was announced that Van Susteren had joined Newsmax TV, and on June 14, she started hosting &quot;The Record with Greta Van Susteren&quot;.

==Personal life==
Van Susteren married tort lawyer John P. Coale in 1988. She and her husband are Scientologists, and in 1995 to &quot;People&quot; she said she is &quot;a strong advocate of their ethics&quot;.

From August 2006 until January 2014, she was a co-owner of the Old Mill Inn, a restaurant in Mattituck, New York, on the North Fork of Long Island.

Van Susteren is on the board of directors at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona in the aftermath of the shooting that killed six people and injured 13 others, including U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords.

She visited Myanmar several times and testified before Congress to draw attention to the human rights abuses and genocide against the Rohingya people.

<doc id="999982" wikidata="Q3132273" url="?curid=999982" title="Thela Hun Ginjeet">
<text>&quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; is a single by the band King Crimson, released in 1981 and on the album &quot;Discipline&quot; (1981). The song name is an anagram of &quot;heat in the jungle&quot;, itself a euphemism for city-based crime. (The term &quot;heat&quot; is American slang for firearms or for police.)

While &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; is in  time, Robert Fripp&#x27;s electric guitar plays in  time during much of the song, creating a polymetric effect. The instrumental middle section of the song features a recording of Adrian Belew&#x27;s voice, in which he describes being confronted by a British Jamaican street gang and subsequently the police while walking around Notting Hill Gate in London with a tape recorder.

==Live versions==
During King Crimson&#x27;s tours in support of &quot;Discipline&quot; and its successor &quot;Beat&quot;, Belew would tell the story while the song was being performed. During the &quot;Beat&quot; tour, the story-telling was somewhat improvised. From the &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; tour onwards, this was dropped, leaving only the sung lyrics, although the original recording was played during tours in the band&#x27;s mid-1990s &quot;double trio&quot; era. This practice continued during the 2024 &quot;Beat&quot; tour, which, while not technically King Crimson, included 2 of the 4 members that recorded the original.

==Cover versions==
* Groups with &quot;Discipline&quot;-era King Crimson members (e.g. Adrian Belew Power Trio, Stick Men, The Crimson ProjeKCt) have covered the song live.
* Les Claypool has covered this song live, along with Primus, his musical project Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade (as included on their live album &quot;Live Frogs Set 1&quot;), and The Claypool Lennon Delirium.
*Supergroup Gizmodrome, of which Belew is a member, performed the song in concert during their 2018 tours and included a live version on the album Gizmodrome Live.

<text>Reinhold is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies to the south-southwest of the crater Copernicus, on the Mare Insularum. It was named after 16th century German astronomer and mathematician Erasmus Reinhold. To the southwest is the slightly smaller crater Lansberg.

The interior walls are d and the irregular outer ramparts are visible against the flat surface of the mare. The interior floor is relatively featureless, with only a few low rises. Just to the northeast is a low, flooded crater designated Reinhold B.

Reinhold is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on current lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Reinhold.

<doc id="999990" wikidata="Q6980606" url="?curid=999990" title="Natural Science Tripos">
<text>The Natural Sciences Tripos is the framework within which most of the science at the University of Cambridge is taught. The tripos includes a wide range of Natural Sciences from physics, astronomy, and geoscience, to chemistry and biology, which are taught alongside the history and philosophy of science. The tripos covers several courses which form the University of Cambridge system of Tripos. It is known for its broad range of study in the first year, in which students cannot study just one discipline, but instead must choose three courses in different areas of the natural sciences and one in mathematics. As is traditional at Cambridge, the degree awarded after Part II (three years of study) is a Bachelor of Arts (BA). A Master of Natural Sciences degree (MSci) is available to those who take the optional Part III (one further year). It was started in the 19th century.

==Teaching==
Teaching is carried out by 16 different departments. Subjects offered in Part IA in 2019 are Biology of Cells, Chemistry, Computer Science, Evolution and Behaviour, Earth Sciences, Materials Science, Mathematics, Physics, Physiology of Organisms and Mathematical Biology; students must take three experimental subjects and one mathematics course. There are three options for the compulsory mathematics element in IA: &quot;Mathematics A&quot;, &quot;Mathematics B&quot; and &quot;Mathematical Biology&quot;. From 2020 Computer Science will no longer be an option in the natural sciences course.

Students specialize further in the second year (Part IB) of their Tripos, taking three subjects from a choice of twenty, and completely in their third year (Part II) in, for example, genetics or astrophysics, although general third year courses do exist – Biomedical and Biological Sciences for biologists and Physical Sciences for chemists, physicists, etc. Fourth year options (Part III) are available in a number of subjects, and usually have an entry requirement of obtaining a 2:1 or a First in second year Tripos Examinations, and is applied for before the commencement of the third year. As of 2008, options with an available Part III option are: Astrophysics; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Earth Sciences; Materials Science and Metallurgy; and Experimental and Theoretical Physics. the tripos is delivered by sixteen different departments including:
* The Department of Chemistry
* The Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology
* The Department of Genetics
* The Department of Physics
* The Institute of Astronomy
* The Department of Biochemistry
* The Department of Pharmacology
* The Department of Pathology
* The Department of Plant Sciences
* The Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience
* The Department of Zoology
* The Department of Psychology
* The Department of Computer Science and Technology
* The Department of Earth Sciences
* The Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy
* The Department of History and Philosophy of Science

==Motivation==
The University of Cambridge believes that their course&#x27;s generalisation, rather than specialisation, gives their students an advantage. First, it allows students to experience subjects at university level before specialising. Second, many modern sciences exist at the boundaries of traditional disciplines, for example, applying methods from a different discipline. Third, this structure allows other scientific subjects, such as Mathematics (traditionally a very strong subject at Cambridge), Medicine and the History and Philosophy of Science, (and previously Computer sciences before it had been removed for 2020 entry) to link with the Natural Sciences Tripos so that once, say, the two-year Part I of the Medical Sciences tripos has been completed, one can specialise in another biological science in Part II during one&#x27;s third year, and still come out with a science degree specialised enough to move into postgraduate studies, such as a PhD.

==Student enrolment==
As a result of this structure, the Natural Sciences Tripos has by far the greatest number of students of any Tripos. Undergraduates who are reading for the Natural Sciences Tripos in order to gain their degrees are colloquially known in University slang as &quot;&#x27;NatSci&quot;s (pronounced &quot;Nat-Ski&#x27;s&quot;), being broadly nicknamed physical science (&#x27;phys&#x27;) or biological science (&#x27;bio&#x27;) NatScis, according to their course choices. (Of course, many students choose both physical and biological options in first year.) The split tends to be about 50:50 between the physical and biological sciences.

In 2018, 2594 students applied and 577 were admitted to the Natural Sciences Tripos.

In order to be accepted to study on the Natural Sciences course, students must sit the ESAT (Engineering and Science Admissions Test) exam in the year of their application. This is a test required by Cambridge to assess their candidates.

<text>Ritter is a lunar impact crater located near the southwestern edge of Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 29.5 km. It was named after German geographer Carl Ritter and German astrophysicist August Ritter.

It is the northwestern member of a crater pair with Sabine to the southeast. To the northwest is the crater Dionysius, and to the north-northeast are Manners and Arago. This crater is roughly circular but with an irregular outer rim. The inner walls have slumped down towards the floor. The interior is irregular with several low ridges. To the northwest of Ritter is a system of parallel rilles designated Rimae Ritter. These follow a course to the northwest. Ranger 8 flew over Ritter prior to impact in Mare Tranquilitatis.

Both Sabine and Ritter were originally believed to be calderas rather than impact craters. In &quot;To A Rocky Moon&quot;, lunar geologist Don E. Wilhelms summarized: &quot;They are identical twins in morphology and size (29-30 km). They lack radial rim ejecta and secondary craters despite their apparent youth. They are positioned at the presumably active edge of a mare. They are even aligned along graben, the Hypatia rilles. Most significant, they lack deep floors recognized since the days of Gilbert as diagnostic of impacts.&quot; However, after the Apollo landings were complete, it was realized that &quot;all craters inside basins suffer enhanced isostatic uplift,&quot; because &quot;the thin crust and greater heat inside basins lower the viscosity of the craters&#x27; substrate, allowing it to reach isostasy with its surroundings more quickly than can other craters.&quot;
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ritter.

<text>Airframe is a novel by the American writer Michael Crichton, his eleventh under his own name and twenty-first overall, first published in 1996, in hardcover, by Knopf, just months after the crash of Tarom Flight 371. As a paperback, &quot;Airframe&quot; was released in 1997 by Ballantine Books. The plot follows Casey Singleton, a quality assurance vice president at the fictional aerospace manufacturer Norton Aircraft, as she investigates an in-flight accident aboard a Norton-manufactured airliner that leaves three passengers dead and 56 injured.

&quot;Airframe&quot; remains one of Crichton&#x27;s few novels not adapted to film. Crichton stated this was due to the great expense needed to make such a film. The novel&#x27;s dense technical details for the accident investigation may also have hindered cinematic adaptations.

==Plot summary==
TransPacific Airlines Flight 545 experiences severe pitch oscillations over the Pacific Ocean, leading to dozens of injured passengers and several deaths. The plane, a Norton Aircraft N-22, has an excellent safety record, and the captain is highly skilled, making the possibility of human error seemingly unlikely. Casey Singleton, a vice president in quality assurance at Norton, is assigned by COO John Marder to join the company&#x27;s Incident Review Team (IRT) to investigate. The IRT has one week to identify the issue in order to prevent a major sale with China from falling apart over safety concerns.

Due to issues with the flight recorders, the IRT is forced to manually check each system of the aircraft. At first, all signs point to the plane&#x27;s slats accidentally deploying mid-flight. Though other N-22s had exhibited similar slat errors in the past, Norton assumed the problem had been fixed. Their search uncovers a counterfeit part in the wing, but this would not have been enough to cause the accident on its own. Casey grows suspicious of Bob Richman, an arrogant Norton member of the family who has been assigned to assist her. Meanwhile, the factory union is concerned the China sale will offset the wing to China, threatening employees&#x27; jobs, and seeks to sabotage the deal.

An unrelated N-22 engine failure, and the release of passenger camera footage from Flight 545, draws heavy media attention. Jennifer Malone, a TV news producer, is interested in reporting on the N-22&#x27;s flaws and pursues the story; Marder asks Casey to conduct an interview. Later, Casey realizes the accident aircraft was equipped with a quick access recorder (QAR); the team did not know the plane was equipped with one because QARs are optional. Casey locates the QAR and pieces together the events that caused the accident. First, a counterfeit part caused a sensor in the plane&#x27;s wing to malfunction, which produced an error message in the cockpit. This error message could be cleared by deploying and retracting the plane&#x27;s slats. Although deploying the slats would change the shape of the wing, the autopilot could adjust without incident. However, the captain&#x27;s son, who was not certified to fly the N-22, was at the controls at the time of the accident; he manually overcorrected, overriding the autopilot and sending the plane into a series of oscillations.

Casey realizes she cannot publicize this information. Publicly pinning the blame on a TransPacific employee would sour relations with the airline, ruining future sales just as surely as any N-22 safety issues would. During her interview, she also discovers Richman has set her up to fail as part of a larger conspiracy. Richman and Marder had secretly prepared a larger sale to a South Korean airline, which included offsetting the wing. They hoped to use the accident to sink the China deal and oust CEO Harold Edgarton, confident that the accident would not jeopardize the Korean deal.

Casey thwarts the plan by allowing Malone onto a test flight for the N-22 from the accident, where it is shown a slat deployment alone would not cause the accident. Once Malone is shown the evidence, she cannot air her segment as planned without opening herself up to a defamation lawsuit. She is also unable to report the true story, since her boss thinks it is not exciting enough to hold people&#x27;s attention. With the N-22&#x27;s reputation cleared, the China deal proceeds. Afterwards, Edgarton promotes Casey to head the company&#x27;s Media Relations Division. Richman is arrested in Singapore for narcotics possession, while Marder leaves the company, supposedly on good terms.

==Major themes==
Air safety procedures are a central theme in the novel. In illustrating the redundancies and safety measures necessary for every step of the airplane construction process as well as condemning the death of other publicly maligned aircraft such as the DC-10, Crichton challenges public perception of air safety, highlighting how the blame for accidents is often directed at the wrong party.

Another central theme, which compounds the issue mentioned above, is investigative journalism, and the consequences when sensational media agencies distort the truth to produce a better-selling story. The TV journalism subplot was singled out for praise in some reviews; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; lauded it as &quot;brutal and fresh and very funny&quot; satire. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; calls his portrayal of TV journalists believable, noting that Crichton &quot;doesn&#x27;t mind making enemies.&quot;

&quot;Airframe&quot; also continues the theme of human failure in human-machine interaction that is present across Crichton&#x27;s other works. Despite malfunctions due to improper maintenance, the plane itself was functional; the incident was a result of human error by an insufficiently trained pilot.

==References to real events==
In &quot;Airframe&quot;, as in most of his novels, Crichton uses the literary device of false documents, presenting numerous technical documents to create a sense of authenticity. He also takes great pains to be as accurate as possible in the novel&#x27;s technical details. When the characters discuss how unfavorable media coverage can be the undoing of a perfectly good aircraft, his account of the American Airlines Flight 191 crash and its causes are consistent with the known facts at the time the novel was written.

In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Crichton said that he drew upon the National Transportation Safety Board&#x27;s aircraft accident report archives during his writing process, calling them &quot;an unbelievable trove.&quot; As a result, the N-22 accident described in the novel resembles two real-life cases:
*The violent oscillations, the issue with the flap/slat handle becoming dislodged, and the importance of pilot training in order to respond properly to the characteristics of a specific aircraft type are closely modeled on the 1993 accident aboard China Eastern Airlines Flight 583.
* A pilot allowing his son to sit at the controls was also the cause of the 1994 Aeroflot Flight 593 crash. As in the novel, the son inadvertently disabled their aircraft&#x27;s autopilot, and the accident could have been averted by re-engaging it. However, while the son in &quot;Airframe&quot; is a pilot, the 15 years old son on Flight 583 was not. Also unlike the novel, the Aeroflot crew did not manage to recover from their overcorrection and crashed, killing all 75 passengers and crew.

==Reception==
&quot;Airframe&quot; received generally positive reviews. In her &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; review, Patricia Holt called it &quot;classic Crichton,&quot; adding that readers will be &quot;surprised, satisfied and even a bit better informed at the end.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said of the novel, &quot;By playing hide and seek with his plot, Mr. Crichton writes as if he were an engineer and his readers were all outsiders. Yet at the same time, he has taken on a complex subject in &quot;Airframe&quot; and made its subtleties dramatically vivid.&quot; Tom De Haven of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Crichton&#x27;s research, saying, &quot;I bet Michael Crichton was a kid who did his homework every night — and not only did it, but triple-checked it, made sure there were no smudges on the paper, then presented it to the teacher between card-stock covers secured with shiny brass fasteners.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&#x27;s&quot; Nancy Harris commended Crichton on his ability to simplify the technical intricacies of aviation, calling &quot;Airframe&quot; a &quot;very readable book.&quot;

Reviews tempered their praise with criticism of Crichton&#x27;s writing style. De Haven took issue with the novel&#x27;s use of genre clichés and &quot;the clunkiest of plot gimmicks.&quot; Holt called it &quot;formulaic but hard to put down&quot; and described its characters as &quot;cardboard.&quot; Lehmann-Haupt went even further, saying, &quot;When you finish the novel and ask yourself why you end up feeling both entertained and frustrated, you are forced to reflect that a writer clever enough to bring such material to life ought to have been able to tell his story without playing manipulative games with the reader.&quot;

Though the central accident in &quot;Airframe&quot; primarily resembles China Eastern Airlines Flight 583 and Aeroflot Flight 593, Mark Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; accused Crichton and his publishers of trying to capitalize on a different airplane disaster. Lawson notes that the novel was &quot;loaded into airport bookstores shortly after the TWA 800 flight went down in the Atlantic,&quot; adding, &quot;Crichton&#x27;s profile as a writer depends on ... extreme topicality.&quot;

==Adaptation==
An adaptation of &quot;Airframe&quot;, alongside an adaptation of &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, was in development in the 1990s with Crichton and John McTiernan producing both, and writer William Wisher Jr. penning the screenplay adaptation.

<text>Popular music in British Columbia is strongly associated with the city of Vancouver. As Canada&#x27;s third largest city, Vancouver has one of the most influential rock and pop scenes in the country. It is also, like Toronto, a common destination for musicians from other parts of the country and from the United States. Additionally, Vancouver has been especially prominent in genres, such as punk rock and hip hop, which tend to be associated with larger cities. Many significant artists have hailed from cities and towns across British Columbia.

British Columbia is home to a number of famous music festivals, such as the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, and institutions like the Rogue Folk Club, also in Vancouver. Major music venues outside of Vancouver include the Capilano University Performing Arts Theatre in North Vancouver, the Evergreen Cultural Centre in Coquitlam, the Red Robinson Show Theatre in Coquitlam, the Chan Centre at the University of British Columbia, and The Kay Meek Centre for the Performing Arts in West Vancouver.

<doc id="999999" wikidata="Q864240" url="?curid=999999" title="Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels">
<text>Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels is an American animated mystery comedy series created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions for ABC. The series aired during the network&#x27;s Saturday morning schedule from September 10, 1977, to June 21, 1980.

==Summary==
The series follows the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels—Brenda, Dee Dee and Taffy—and their friend Captain Caveman (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman and superhero whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (which also aired on ABC). The show also borrowed heavily from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, another Hanna-Barbera show.

Captain Caveman&#x27;s powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of &quot;Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!&quot; Captain Caveman&#x27;s voice was provided by Mel Blanc.

A total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics&quot; in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Stars&quot; in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot; were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977 to 1978. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in sporting competitions as part of &quot;The Scooby Doobies&quot; team on the half-hour &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot; segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track, one of the last Hanna-Barbera productions to do so.

==Characters==
The series features the following four main characters throughout its run:

* Captain Caveman, or &quot;Cavey&quot; for short (voiced by Mel Blanc), is the protagonist of the show, billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first superhero.&quot; He is a caveman who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, &quot;I&#x27;ll be 2 million next month.&quot;). He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (&quot;Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.&quot; &quot;CRASH!&quot;), which was a reference to the gasoline rationing shortages of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical &quot;caveman-talk&quot;, replacing subject pronouns with their object equivalents and dropping articles such as &quot;the&quot; (for example, &quot;Me know where bad guys are hiding.&quot;), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase &quot;unga bunga&quot;. He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (e.g. bicycles, TV sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery. Despite this, Cavey is ultimately loyal to them and he is very capable capturing culprits.
*Dee Dee Skyes (voiced by Vernee Watson) is the brains of the Teen Angels. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an afro and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to Velma Dinkley of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. She is misidentified as Brenda in the opening credits. Though some sources give the family name of both Dee Dee and her uncle Frank as &quot;Sykes&quot;, their name is given as &quot;Skyes&quot; in the episode &quot;The Fur Freight Fright&quot;, which featured Frank and his company &quot;Skye&#x27;s Furs&quot;. Her adaptation in the 2020 film &quot;Scoob!&quot; as Blue Falcon&#x27;s assistant (voiced by Kiersey Clemons) also introduced herself as Dee Dee Skyes, and she is listed as such in the closing credits. 
*Brenda Chance (voiced by Marilyn Schreffler) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery similar to that of Shaggy Rogers, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.
*Taffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member and leader of the group, renowned for her cry of &quot;Zowie!&quot; whenever she comes up with a plan (or &quot;Another Daffy Taffy Plan&quot; as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a New York-influenced/Southern accent. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.

==Opening and closing credits==
In the opening credits for each episode voice-over narration by Gary Owens said Captain Caveman was &quot;set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice.&quot;

The music heard in the closing credits is the &quot;CB Bears&quot; theme. After the first three screens, the end credit roll is from the original two-hour version of &quot;Scooby&#x27;s All-Star Laff-A-Lympics&quot;.

==Later appearances==
===The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980–82)===
In November 1980, Captain Caveman began to star in segments of his own on &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, one of many spin-offs of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s popular prime-time show &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, often in a role similar to that of Superman. Captain Caveman worked at &quot;The Daily Granite&quot; newspaper with Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble. His &quot;secret identity&quot; was Chester the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.

===The Flintstone Kids (1986–88)===
In 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of &quot;The Flintstone Kids&quot; called &quot;Captain Caveman and Son&quot; with his son Cavey Jr. (voiced by Charlie Adler). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain&#x27;s mumbled &quot;unga bunga&quot; became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each &quot;episode&quot; of the show. The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue. He had no secret identity.

===Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe===
Captain Caveman and Dee Dee Skyes appeared in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film &quot;Scoob!&quot;, with Captain Caveman voiced by Tracy Morgan and Dee Dee voiced by Kiersey Clemons. Dee Dee appears as the pilot of the &quot;Falcon Fury&quot; and assistant of the Blue Falcon. Captain Caveman is an inhabitant of a prehistoric ecosystem under Messick Mountain and part of a tribe with long body hair like him and is capable of speaking proper English.

Captain Caveman appears in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. His design is the same as in &quot;Scoob!&quot; Captain Caveman is seen watching the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad while swinging from the overhead power line that Magilla Gorilla was riding his unicycle on.

===Other appearances===
* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made appearances in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series, &quot;Wacky Races&quot;. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.
* Captain Caveman later appeared in the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot;, with Captain Caveman voiced by Chris Edgerly and Cavey Jr. voiced by Maurice LaMarche.

* Captain Caveman appeared in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode &quot;Ban on the Fun&quot;, voiced by Breckin Meyer. In a segment that parodies &quot;Laff-A-Lympics&quot; in the style of the Munich massacre, Captain Caveman and Shaggy Rogers confront Daisy Mayhem and the former blows her up with the &quot;wrong club&quot;.
* In a Halloween-themed episode of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman-like costume. During the episode, he exclaims &quot;DaAaAaA! I&#x27;m the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!&quot;

* In &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon&quot;, a person cosplaying as Captain Caveman makes an appearance in a Hanna-Barbera-themed convention.

The Teen Angels work as reporters and are young adults. As a result, they are referred to as the &quot;Young Adult Angels&quot;. It is later revealed in &quot;Better Off Fred&quot; that Captain Caveman is actually Barney Rubble who grew his hair out while frozen in ice.
* Captain Caveman appeared in the &quot;Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs&quot; episode &quot;Caveman Begins&quot; (2020), voiced by independent animator Tom Megalis.

<doc id="1000005" wikidata="Q114174" url="?curid=1000005" title="Glucono-δ-lactone">
<text>Glucono-δ-lactone (GDL), also known as gluconolactone, is an organic compound with the formula . A colorless solid, it is an oxidized derivative of glucose.

It is typically produced by the aerobic oxidation of glucose in the presence of the enzyme glucose oxidase. The conversion cogenerates hydrogen peroxide, which is often the key product of the enzyme:

Gluconolactone spontaneously hydrolyzes to gluconic acid:

==Applications==
Gluconolactone is a food additive with the E-number E575 used as a sequestrant, an acidifier, or a curing, pickling, or leavening agent. It is a lactone of -gluconic acid. Pure GDL is a white odorless crystalline powder.

GDL has been marketed for use in feta cheese. GDL is pH-neutral, but hydrolyses in water to gluconic acid which is acidic, adding a tangy taste to foods, though it has roughly a third of the sourness of citric acid. It is metabolized to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; one gram of GDL yields roughly the same amount of metabolic energy as one gram of sugar.

Upon addition to water, GDL is partially hydrolysed to gluconic acid, with the balance between the lactone form and the acid form established as a chemical equilibrium. The rate of hydrolysis of GDL is increased by heat and high pH.

The yeast &quot;Maudiozyma bulderi&quot; can be used to ferment gluconolactone to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The pH value greatly affects culture growth. Gluconolactone at 1 or 2% in a mineral media solution causes the pH to drop below 3.

It is also a complete inhibitor of the enzyme amygdalin beta-glucosidase at concentrations of 1 mM.

<text>Römer is a lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the Sinus Amoris in the northeast section of the Moon. It was named after Danish astronomer Ole Rømer. It lies in the southwestern part of the mountainous region named the Montes Taurus. It was unofficially named as Atatürk by astronomer Hugh Percy Wilkins in his lunar map, possibly due to the fact that the Montes Taurus (or Toros Dağları in Turkish) are located in Turkey. To the west-northwest is the crater-bay Le Monnier, on the eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis.

The rim of Römer has relatively high walls with a d inner surface. There is a small craterlet on the north part of the floor, and a large central peak at the midpoint. Römer has a ray system, and due to these rays, it is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

To the northwest of the crater is a prominent system of rilles named the Rimae Römer. These follow a course to the north from the western rim of the crater, and have a combined length of about 110 kilometres.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Römer.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Römer K — &quot;See&quot; Franck (crater).
* Römer L — &quot;See&quot; Brewster (crater).

<text>Wyllis Oswald Cooper (January 26, 1899 – June 22, 1955) was an American writer and producer.

He is best remembered for creating and writing the old time radio programs &quot;Lights Out&quot; (1934–1947) and &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; (1947–1949).

==Biography==
Born Willis Oswald Cooper in Pekin, Illinois, he attended Pekin High School, graduating in 1916. He soon joined the U.S. Cavalry where, achieving the rank of Sergeant, he spent time on the Mexican border. In 1917, he became a part of the Signal Corps and was sent to France during World War I. While in France he was gassed at the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He remained on active duty until 1919 when he left to become an advertising writer, though he maintained his reserve status.

By the late 1920s he was writing advertising copy in Chicago and entered radio, writing scripts for the 1929–1931 NBC radio program &quot;Empire Builders&quot;. He later worked as continuity editor of CBS Chicago and, in 1933, left to take the same position at NBC Chicago. In 1934, he created his best known dramatic series, a late night horror radio program called &quot;Lights Out&quot;, which he also directed. Airing at midnight, the program quickly earned a reputation for its gory deaths and sound effects.

The show would prove to be a long-term success, but in 1936, Cooper capitalized on the fame of &quot;Lights Out&quot; and resigned from NBC, moving to Hollywood, California, where he worked as a screenwriter for film studios. His screenplay for the 1939 film &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; introduced the much-parodied character of Ygor. He contributed to a few of the Mr. Moto films. At the same time, he continued to provide radio scripts for various series including &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot;.

Arch Oboler, who took over the writing of &quot;Lights Out&quot; when Cooper left, would suggest that Cooper was the first person to create a unique form of radio drama, writing, &quot;Radio drama (as distinguished from theatre plays boiled down to kilocycle size) began at midnight, in the middle thirties, on one of the upper NBC floors of Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart. The pappy was a rotund writer by the name of Willys &quot;(sic)&quot; Cooper.&quot;

By 1940, Cooper moved to New York City. Here he changed his name from “Willis” to “Wyllis” in order &quot;to please his wife&#x27;s numerological inclinations&quot;. He continued to make a living writing radio scripts for various network programs including &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;, the sponsored successor of Orson Welles&#x27;s Mercury Theatre.

During World War II, he was made a consultant to the Secretary of War and produced, directed and wrote a weekly news and variety propaganda series entitled &quot;&#x27;The Army Hour&quot;.

In 1944, Cooper joined the radio department of New York&#x27;s Compton Advertising, Inc. In 1947, he created what was arguably his finest radio effort, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;. It began over the Mutual Broadcasting System network and later moved to ABC. He also wrote and directed a crime anthology for NBC entitled &quot;Whitehall 1212&quot;, which debuted on November 18, 1951. The series was hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, fictional curator of the Black Museum at Scotland Yard. It featured an allegedly British cast and told stories inspired by artifacts held by the famous London crime museum. Cooper&#x27;s show competed with a similar program hosted by Orson Welles which ran on Mutual in 1952.

As television became the dominant entertainment medium, Cooper experimented with various programs including &quot;Volume One&quot;, which he wrote and produced.

Cooper resided in Glen Gardner, New Jersey, and died in High Bridge, New Jersey, on June 22, 1955.

<text>Carlo Fortunato Pietro Ponti Sr. (11 December 1912 – 10 January 2007) was an Italian film producer with more than 140 productions to his credit. Along with Dino De Laurentiis, he is credited with reinvigorating and popularizing Italian cinema post-World War II, producing some of the country&#x27;s most acclaimed and financially-successful films of the 1950s and 1960s.

Ponti worked with many of the most important directors of Italian cinema of the era, including Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Vittorio De Sica, as well as many international directors such as Agnès Varda and David Lean. He helped launch the career of his wife, international film star Sophia Loren. He won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film for &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954) and was nominated for Best Picture for producing &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965). In 1996, he was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

==Early life==
Ponti was born in Magenta, Lombardy, where his grandfather had been mayor of the city. Ponti studied law at the University of Milan. He joined his father&#x27;s law firm in Milan and became involved in the film business through negotiating contracts.

==Career==
===Early films===
Ponti attempted to establish a film industry in Milan in 1940 and produced Mario Soldati&#x27;s &quot;Piccolo mondo antico&quot; there, starring Alida Valli, in her first notable role. The film dealt with the Italian struggle against the Austrians for the inclusion of northeastern Italy into the Kingdom of Italy during the Risorgimento. The film was successful, because it was easy to see &quot;the Austrians as Germans&quot; during World War II. As a result, Ponti was briefly jailed for undermining relations with Nazi Germany.

Ponti accepted an offer from Riccardo Gualino&#x27;s Lux Film in Rome in 1941. He made &quot;Giacomo the Idealist&quot; (1943), &quot;A Yank in Rome&quot; (1946), &quot;To Live in Peace&quot; (1947), &quot;The White Primrose&quot; (1948), &quot;Prelude to Madness&quot; (1948) and &quot;Hey Boy&quot; (1948).

Ponti produced some films starring Gina Lollobrigida: &quot;Alarm Bells&quot; (1949), &quot;The White Line&quot; (1950), &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot; (1950). &quot;Her Favourite Husband&quot; (1950) was a British-Italian co production with Jean Kent. He made a number of comedies including &quot;Figaro Here, Figaro There&quot; (1950), &quot;Toto the Third Man&quot; (1951) and &quot;Toto in Color&quot; (1952), with Totò, plus &quot;The Knight Has Arrived!&quot; (1951), &quot;The Piano Tuner Has Arrived&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Steamship Owner&quot; (1951) with Walter Chiari. Ponti alternated this with more serious material such as &quot;Europe &#x27;51&quot; (1952) from Roberto Rossellini, &quot;Brothers of Italy&quot; (1952), &quot;Lieutenant Giorgio&quot; (1953), and &quot;Easy Years&quot; (1953). &quot;The Unfaithfuls&quot; (1953) reunited Ponti with Lollobrigida, while &quot;Neapolitan Carousel&quot; (1954) won the International Prize at Cannes.

===International breakthrough and Sophia Loren===
In 1954 Ponti had his greatest artistic success with the production of Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La strada&quot;. However, Fellini denied Ponti&#x27;s role in its success and said that &quot;&quot;La Strada&quot; was made in spite of Ponti and De Laurentiis&quot;. Along with a Toto comedy &quot;The Doctor of the Mad&quot; (1954) he and de Laurentiis produced an international film, &quot;Mambo&quot; (1954) directed by Robert Rossen. There was &quot;An American in Rome&quot; (1955) with Alberto Sordi and &quot;The Gold of Naples&quot; (1954) with a young Sophia Loren.

Loren was the female lead in Ponti&#x27;s &quot;Attila&quot; (1954), a biopic of Attila the Hun with Anthony Quinn that became a big box office success. Loren was in &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Beautiful Wife&quot; (1955), a comedy.

Ponti and de Laurentiis made the epic war film &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956). In June 1956 his partnership with De Laurentiis ended after more than eighty films over six years.

Ponti continued to produce smaller movies for the Italian market such as &quot;The Railroad Man&quot; (1956), and &quot;Guendalina&quot; (1957), but his focus was increasingly on bigger budgeted films aimed at the international market starring Loren: &quot;The Black Orchid&quot; (1959) with Anthony Quinn, &quot;That Kind of Woman&quot; (1959) with Tab Hunter, &quot;Heller in Pink Tights&quot; (1960) with Quinn again, &quot;A Breath of Scandal&quot; (1960) with John Gavin. &quot;Two Women&quot; (1960), starring Loren and directed by Vittorio de Sica, was a huge success, winning Loren the Oscar.

===French films===
Ponti produced a series of movies in France: &quot;Lola&quot; (1961) starred Anouk Aimee, &quot;A Woman Is a Woman&quot; (1961) directed by Jean-Luc Godard, &quot;Léon Morin, Priest&quot; (1961) from Jean-Pierre Melville starring Jean Paul Belmondo, &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; (1962) from Agnès Varda, &quot;Le Doulos&quot; (1962) with Belmondo, &quot;Landru&quot; (1962), plus &quot;The Carabineers&quot; (1963) and &quot;Contempt&quot; (1963) from Godard.

Ponti continued to make movies in Italy, notably &quot;Boccaccio &#x27;70&quot; (1962), &quot;Redhead&quot; (1962), &quot;The Empty Canvas&quot; (1962), &quot;Break Up&quot; (1965) and two with Loren, &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; (1963) and &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot; (1964).

===MGM===
Ponti produced his most popular and financially successful film, &quot;Doctor Zhivago,&quot; in 1965; the movie was directed by David Lean and made by MGM. Also for MGM Ponti produced &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), a war film with Loren, &quot;The Girl and the General&quot; (1967) with Rod Steiger, &quot;Ghosts – Italian Style&quot; (1967), and three notable films with Michelangelo Antonioni, &quot;Blowup&quot; in 1966, &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; in 1970 and &quot;The Passenger&quot; in 1974.

He made &quot;The 10th Victim&quot; (1965), and some films for Paramount, &quot;Smashing Time&quot; (1967) &quot;Diamonds for Breakfast&quot; (1968).

===Later career===
Ponti&#x27;s later movies included &quot;The Priest&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1970) with Loren, &quot;What?&quot; (1972) from Roman Polanski, &quot;Giordano Bruno&quot; (1973), &quot;Torso&quot; (1973) a gallo with Suzy Kendall, &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (1973) with Oliver Reed, &quot;Mr. Hercules Against Karate&quot; (1973), &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot; (1974), &quot;The Voyage&quot; (1974) with Loren, &quot;Sex Pot&quot; (1975) with Loren and Mastroinanni, &quot;L&#x27;Infermiera&quot; (1975) with Ursula Andress, and &quot;Down and Dirty&quot; (1977),

His final credits included &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot; (1977), an international co production starring Loren, and &quot;A Special Day&quot; (1977) with Mastroianni and Loren.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
In 1946, he married Giuliana Fiastri with whom he had a daughter, Guendalina, in 1951, and a son, Alex, in 1953. While serving as a judge in a beauty contest in 1951, Ponti met a minor actress named Sofia Lazzaro (real name Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone). He subsequently cast her in films such as &quot;Anna&quot; (1951). In 1952, his friend Goffredo Lombardo, head of production at Titanus, changed Lazzaro&#x27;s name to Sophia Loren.

Five years later, Ponti obtained a Mexican divorce from his first wife and married Sophia Loren by proxy. Divorce was still forbidden in Italy, and he was informed that were he to return there, he would be charged with bigamy, and Loren would be charged with &quot;concubinage&quot;.

Ponti co-produced several films in Hollywood starring Loren, establishing her fame. In 1960, he and Loren returned to Italy and when summoned to court, denied being married. In 1962, they had the marriage annulled, after which Ponti arranged with his first wife, Giuliana, that the three of them move to France (which at that time allowed divorce) and become French citizens. In 1965, Giuliana Ponti divorced her husband, allowing Ponti to marry Loren in 1966 in a civil wedding in Sèvres. They later became French citizens after their application was approved by then-French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.

Ponti and Loren had two sons:
* Carlo Ponti Jr. (born 29 December 1968)
* Edoardo Ponti (born 6 January 1973)

Their daughters-in-law are Sasha Alexander and Andrea Meszaros. They have four grandchildren.

Loren remained married to Ponti until his death on 10 January 2007 of pulmonary complications.

===Kidnapping attempts===
Two unsuccessful attempts were made to kidnap Ponti in 1975, including one involving an attack on his car with gunfire.

===Smuggling charges===
He was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1979 for smuggling money and works of art abroad, fined 22 billion lire, and sentenced to four years in prison. Ponti did not attend the hearing, as his French nationality made him immune from extradition. He was finally cleared of the charges in 1990.

==Art collection==
Ponti owned works by, among others, Picasso, Georges Braque, Renoir, René Magritte (including his &quot;Lumière du pole&quot; from 1927), Salvador Dalí, Henry Moore (including his &quot;Figure&quot; from 1933), Barbara Hepworth, Giorgio de Chirico and Canaletto. His collection was renowned for containing ten works by Francis Bacon. These included examples from his early Van Gogh series, triptychs, self-portraits and pope paintings, which were rarely publicised or lent to public exhibitions. In 1977 the Bacon paintings, then valued at an estimated $6.7 million, were seized and turned over by the Italian government to the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan; thirty-three sketches by George Grosz went to a museum in Caserta. When Ponti reached a deal with the Italian government and was cleared of the charges brought against him in 1990, he regained possession of 230 confiscated paintings. At some point, the collection is said to have been split between Ponti and Loren.

Over the years, several works have been sold privately. In 2006 two Bacon paintings that had previously been in the Ponti collection were exhibited in an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London. One, a vertical composition of four self-portraits, had already been sold to the American collector Steven A. Cohen. In 2007 another pope painting by Bacon, sold by Ponti in 1991, was sold in a private deal brokered by Acquavella Galleries in New York for more than £15 million. That same year, &quot;Study for Portrait II&quot; (1956) was consigned by Loren at Christie&#x27;s; it was auctioned for the record price of £14.2 million ($27.5 million).

==Death==
Carlo Ponti Sr died on January 10th, 2007 in Geneva, Switzerland, of complications from pulmonary. Carlo Ponti Sr was 94 years old. He was survived by his daughter Guendalina (b. 1951), and his son Alessandro (b. 1953) from his first marriage; and by his second wife, Sophia Loren, and their sons Carlo (b. 1968) and Edoardo Ponti (b. 1973).

His body rests in the family tomb in Magenta, Lombardy.

<doc id="1000044" wikidata="Q6133874" url="?curid=1000044" title="James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele">
<text>James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele (22 September 1395 – 4 July 1450) was an English soldier and politician. He was born at Herstmonceux, Sussex, the second son of Sir William Fiennes (1 August 1357 – 18 January 1402) and his wife Elizabeth Batisford (Wartling, Sussex, 1363 - Herstmonceux, 18 January 1405).

Fiennes fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1436 and High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1438. He was Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1447 to 1450, and Lord High Treasurer of England from 1449 to 1450. Fiennes&#x27; tenure as Lord High Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England.

He was summoned to Parliament from 1446 to 1449 and is said to have been created Baron Saye and Sele by letters patent in 1447. Saye and Sele was a supporter of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, the principal power behind the throne of Henry VI.

After Suffolk&#x27;s deposition and murder in 1450, Fiennes was imprisoned in the Tower with his son-in-law William Cromer, deputy-sheriff of Kent in 1444. Having been released from the tower and handed over to the rebels as a placatory gesture by the King, Baron Saye was brought to Guildhall for a sham trial. Upon being found guilty of treason, he was paraded through part of London and beheaded by a mob of the rebels in London under Jack Cade at the Standard in Cheapside on 4 July 1450. 

His son-in-law was also executed by the rebels outside the city walls on the same day. The heads of the two men were put on pikes and unceremoniously paraded through the streets of London while their bearers pushed them together so that they appeared to kiss. Fiennes was subsequently buried in the Franciscan church at Newgate. Shortly after the burial, English settlers dispossessed from their property in Bayeux and Caen (who had recently arrived in London) removed his coat of arms from the pillar by his grave and reversed it - an act intended to dishonour the dead. .He was succeeded in the barony by his son William.

==Ancestry==
==Family and legacy==
He married twice. 
His first wife was Joan, whose family name is uncertain, and their children were:
*Elizabeth (died 1475), who married three times. First, her stepmother&#x27;s brother William Cromer (died 1450), of Tunstall, murdered like her father by Jack Cade&#x27;s rebels; secondly Alexander Iden, of Westwell, Jack Cade&#x27;s capturer, and lastly Sir Lawrence Raynsford (died 1490). Both her first two husbands had been a High Sheriff of Kent and her last was a High Sheriff of Essex and of Wiltshire.
*William (born about 1428), who became 2nd Baron Saye and Sele and was killed in 1471 during the Battle of Barnet.

Before 1441, he married as second wife Emmeline (died 5 January 1452), daughter of Sir William Cromer, twice Lord Mayor of London. They may have had two daughters.

Fiennes appears as a named character in the play Henry VI, Part 2 by William Shakespeare, while the Battle of Barnet at which his son William died is referenced in the next play of the trilogy, Henry VI, Part 3.

His elder brother, Roger Fiennes (1384–1449) married Elizabeth Holland (daughter of John Holland (Duke of Exeter, half-brother of Richard II, son of Thomas Holland and Joan &quot;the fair&quot; of Kent) and Elizabeth of Lancaster (daughter of John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster))

<text>Christopher Bernau (born Herbert Augustine Bernau, June 2, 1940 – June 14, 1989) was an American actor.

==Filmography==
*&quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1969–1970) (Phillip Todd/Opening Voiceover)
*Broadway on Showtime (1980) (Dracula)
*&quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1977–1988) (Alan Spaulding)

==Life and career==
Bernau was born in Santa Barbara, California to Herbert Bernau, a physiotherapist, and Emma Bernau (née Vercellino), a homemaker. Bernau showed a love for the theatre at an early age, and was frequently cast in high school plays.

Bernau trained in the drama department at the University of California before getting his big break, appearing in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; in 1962. He continued in that role until 1964, when he toured nationally in the production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; These roles, in addition to performing at Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival, led to an appearance in a brief story arc on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in 1969 and 1970, where he portrayed Philip Todd.

His most famous role, however, was that of villain Alan Spaulding on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a role he played from 1977 to 1984 and again from 1986 until 1988. He left the show due to illness shortly before his death in 1989.

Though his famous character was portrayed as a habitual womanizer, Bernau is considered to be one of the only truly &quot;out&quot; soap opera actors, as it was fairly well known by both the actors he worked with and the soap press at large that he was gay.

==Death==
Bernau was diagnosed with HIV but continued to work on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. He left the show in the summer of 1988, when he became too ill to show up at work, with his role being recast with Daniel Pilon.

Bernau died of a heart attack brought on by complications from AIDS on June 14, 1989, at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in New York City at the age of 49. At first, Bernau&#x27;s AIDS diagnosis was kept private, with his death certificate listing &#x27;natural causes&#x27; as the cause of his death.

He is buried at Santa Barbara Cemetery.

<text>A face transplant is a medical procedure to replace all or part of a person&#x27;s face using tissue from a donor. Part
of a field called &quot;Vascularized Composite Tissue Allotransplantation&quot; (VCA) it involves the transplantation of facial skin, the nasal structure, the nose, the lips, the muscles of facial movement used for expression, the nerves that provide sensation, and, potentially, the bones that support the face. The recipient of a face transplant will take life-long medications to suppress the immune system and fight off rejection.

The world&#x27;s first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out in France in 2005. The world&#x27;s first full face transplant was completed in Spain in 2010. Turkey, France, the United States, and Spain (in order of total number of successful face transplants performed) are considered the leading countries in the research into the procedure.

==Beneficiaries of face transplant==
People with faces disfigured by trauma, burns, disease, or birth defects might aesthetically benefit from the procedure. Professor Peter Butler at the Royal Free Hospital first suggested this approach in treating people with facial disfigurement in a &quot;Lancet&quot; article in 2002. This suggestion caused considerable debate at the time concerning the ethics of this procedure.

An alternative to a face transplant is facial reconstruction, which typically involves moving the patient&#x27;s own skin from their back, buttocks, thighs, or chest to their face in a series of as many as 50 operations to regain even limited functionality, and a face that is often likened to a mask or a living quilt.

==History==

=== Self as donor (&quot;face replant&quot;)===
The world&#x27;s first full-face replant operation was on 9-year-old Sandeep Kaur, whose face was ripped off when her hair was caught in a thresher. Sandeep&#x27;s mother witnessed the accident. Sandeep arrived at the hospital unconscious with her face in two pieces in a plastic bag. An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; recounts: &quot;In 1994, a nine-year-old child in northern India lost her face and scalp in a threshing machine accident. Her parents raced to the hospital with her face in a plastic bag and a surgeon managed to reconnect the arteries and replant the skin.&quot; The operation was successful, although the child was left with some muscle damage as well as scarring around the perimeter where the facial skin was sutured back on. Sandeep&#x27;s doctor was Abraham Thomas, one of India&#x27;s top microsurgeons. In 2004, Sandeep was training to be a nurse.

In 1996, a similar operation was performed in the Australian state of Victoria, when a woman&#x27;s face and scalp, torn off in a similar accident, was packed in ice and successfully reattached.

===Partial face transplant===
====France====
The world&#x27;s first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Benoit Lengelé, a Belgian plastic surgeon, and Jean-Michel Dubernard in Amiens, France. Isabelle Dinoire underwent surgery to replace her original face, which had been mauled by her dog. A triangle of face tissue from a brain-dead woman&#x27;s nose and mouth was grafted onto the patient. On 13 December 2007, the first detailed report of the progress of this transplant after 18 months was released in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; and documents that the patient was happy with the results but also that the journey has been very difficult, especially with respect to her immune system&#x27;s response. Dinoire died on 22 April 2016
at the age of 49 following cancer from medications.

A 29-year-old French man underwent surgery in 2007. He had a facial tumor called a neurofibroma caused by a genetic disorder. The tumor was so massive that the man could not eat or speak properly.

In March 2008, the treatment of 30-year-old Pascal Coler of France, who has neurofibromatosis, ended after he received what his doctors call the world&#x27;s first successful almost full face transplant. The operation, which lasted approximately 20 hours, was designed and performed by Laurent Lantieri and his team (Jean-Paul Meningaud, Antonios Paraskevas and Fabio Ingallina).

====China====
In April 2006, Guo Shuzhong at the Xijing military hospital in Xi&#x27;an, transplanted the cheek, upper lip, and nose of Li Guoxing, who was mauled by an Asiatic black bear while protecting his sheep. On 21 December 2008, it was reported that Li had died in July in his home village in Yunnan. Prior to his death, a documentary on the Discovery Channel showed he had stopped taking immuno-suppressant drugs in favour of herbal medication; a decision that was likely a contributing factor to his death, according to his surgeon.

====Turkey====
Selahattin Özmen performed a partial face transplant on 17 March 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year-old woman at Gazi University&#x27;s hospital in Ankara. It was Turkey&#x27;s third, the first woman-to-woman and the first three-dimensional with bone tissue. The patient from Kahramanmaraş had lost her upper jaw six years prior in a firearm accident, including her mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity, and was since then unable to eat. She had undergone around 35 reconstructive plastic surgery operations. The donor was a 28-year-old Turkish woman of Moldavian origin in Istanbul, who had died by suicide. Nergis died in Ankara on 15 November 2016 after she was hospitalized two days prior complaining about acute pain.

====Belgium====
In December 2011, a 54-year-old man underwent a partial face transplant to the lower two-thirds of the face (including bone) after a ballistic accident. The operation was performed by a multidisciplinary team led by plastic surgeon Phillip Blondeel; Hubert Vermeersch, Nathalie Roche and Filip Stillaert were other members of the surgical team. For the first time 3D CT planning was used to plan the operation that lasted 20 hours. As of 2014 the patient is alive, with &quot;good recovery of motor and sensory function and social reintegration&quot;.

==== Italy ====
In September 2018, a 49-year-old woman affected by Neurofibromatosis type I received a partial face transplant from a 21-year-old girl at Sant&#x27;Andrea Hospital of Sapienza University in Rome. The procedure took 27 hours and was carried out by two teams led by Fabio Santanelli di Pompeo and Benedetto Longo. The patient had a complication and after two days the surgeons had to replace the facial graft with autologous tissue. The patient is still alive and waiting for a second face transplantation.

==== Canada ====
In May 2018, the first Canadian complete face transplant was performed under the leadership of plastic surgeon Daniel Borsuk at the Hopital Maisonneuve Rosemont, in Montreal, Quebec. The transplant took over 30 hours and replaced the upper and lower jaws, nose, lips and teeth on Maurice Desjardins, a 64-year-old man that shot himself in a hunting accident. At that time, Mr. Desjardins was the oldest person to benefit from a face transplant.

===Full face transplant===

On 20 March 2010, a team of 30 Spanish doctors led by plastic surgeon Joan Pere Barret at the Vall d&#x27;Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona carried out the world&#x27;s first full face transplant, on a man injured in a shooting accident.

On 8 July 2010, the French media reported that a full face transplant, including tear ducts and eyelids, was carried out at the Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil.

In March 2011, a surgical team, led by Bohdan Pomahač at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, performed a full face transplant on Dallas Wiens, who was badly disfigured in a power line accident that left him blind and without lips, nose or eyebrows. The patient&#x27;s sight couldn&#x27;t be recovered but he has been able to talk on the phone and smell.

In April 2011, less than one month after the hospital performed the first full face transplant in the country, the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital face transplant team, led by Bohdan Pomahač, performed the nation&#x27;s second full face transplant on patient Mitch Hunter of Speedway, Indiana. It was the third face transplant procedure to be performed at BWH and the fourth face transplant in the country. The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace the full facial area of the patient, including the nose, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them and provide sensation. Hunter had a severe shock from a high voltage electrical wire following a car accident in 2001.

====Poland====

On 15 May 2013, at the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology branch in Gliwice, Poland, an entire face was transplanted onto a male patient, Grzegorz (aged 33) after he lost the front of his head in a machine accident at work. The surgery took 27 hours and was directed by Professor Adam Maciejewski. There had not been much planning or prep time before the surgery, which was performed about one month after the accident, because the transplantation was done as an urgent life-saving surgery due to the patient&#x27;s difficulty in eating and breathing. Shortly after the donor&#x27;s death, the decision to perform the surgery was made and his body was transported hundreds of kilometers to Gliwice once his relatives gave their consent. The doctors believe that their patient has an excellent chance to live a normal, active life after surgery, and that his face should operate more or less normally (his eyes survived the accident untouched).

Seven months later, on 4 December, the same Polish medical team in Gliwice transplanted a face onto a 26-year-old female patient with neurofibromatosis. Two months after the operation, she left the hospital.

====Turkey====
On 21 January 2012, Turkish surgeon Ömer Özkan and his team successfully performed a full face transplant at Akdeniz University&#x27;s hospital in Antalya. The 19-year-old patient, Uğur Acar, was badly burnt in a house fire when he was a baby. The donor was 39-year-old Ahmet Kaya, who died on 20 January. The Turkish doctors declared that his body had accepted the new tissue.

Almost one month later on 24 February 2012, a surgical team led by Serdar Nasır conducted the country&#x27;s second successful full face transplant at Hacettepe University&#x27;s hospital in Ankara on 25-year-old Cengiz Gül. The patient&#x27;s face was badly burned in a television tube implosion accident when he was two years old. The donor was a undisclosed 40-year-old (the donor&#x27;s family did not permit the identity of the donor to be revealed), who experienced brain death two days before the surgery following a motorcycle accident that occurred on 17 February.

On 16 May 2012, surgeon Ömer Özkan and his team at the Akdeniz University Hospital performed the country&#x27;s fourth and their second full face transplant. The face and ears of 27-year-old patient Turan Çolak from İzmir were burnt when he fell into an oven when he was three and half years old. The donor was Tevfik Yılmaz, a 19-year-old man from Uşak who had attempted suicide on 8 May. He was declared brain dead in the evening hours of 15 May after having been in intensive care for seven days. His parents donated all his organs.

On 18 July 2013, the face of a Polish man was successfully given to a Turkish man in a transplant performed by Özkan, at Akdeniz University hospital following a 6.5-hour operation, making it the fifth such operation to take place in the country. It was the 25th face transplant operation in the world. The donor was Andrzej Kucza, a 42-year-old Polish tourist who was declared brain dead following a heart attack on 14 July while swimming in Turkey&#x27;s sea resort Muğla. The receiver was 27-year-old patient Recep Sert from Bursa.

On 23 August 2013, surgeon Ömer Özkan and his team at Akdeniz University performed the sixth face transplant surgery in Turkey. Salih Üstün (54) received the scalp, eyelids, jaw and maxilla, nose and the half tongue of 31-year-old Muhittin Turan, who was declared brain dead after a motorcycle accident that took place two days before.

On 30 December 2013, Özkan and his team conducted their fifth and Turkey&#x27;s seventh face transplant surgery at the hospital of Akdeniz University. The nose, upper lip, upper jaw and maxilla of brain dead Ali Emre Küçük, aged 34, were successfully transplanted to 22-year-old Recep Kaya, whose face was badly deformed in a shotgun accident. While Kaya was flown from Kırklareli to Antalya via Istanbul in four hours, the donor&#x27;s organs were transported from Edirne by an ambulance airplane. The surgery took 4 hours and 10 minutes.

====United Kingdom====

In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London&#x27;s Royal Free Hospital in the UK was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out face transplants. His team will select four adult patients (children cannot be selected due to concerns over consent), with operations being carried out at six-month intervals. As of 2022, neither Butler nor any other UK surgeon has performed a face transplant.

====United States====

In 2004, the Cleveland Clinic became the first institution to approve this surgery and test it on cadavers.

In 2005, the Cleveland Clinic became the first US hospital to approve the procedure. In December 2008, a team at the Cleveland Clinic, led by Maria Siemionow and including a group of supporting doctors and six plastic surgeons (Steven Bernard, Dr Mark Hendrickson, Robert Lohman, Dan Alam and Francis Papay) performed the first face transplant in the US on a woman named Connie Culp. It was the world&#x27;s first near-total facial transplant and the fourth known facial transplant to have been successfully performed to date. This operation was the first facial transplant known to have included bones, along with muscle, skin, blood vessels, and nerves. The woman received a nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw, and even some teeth from a brain-dead donor. As doctors recovered the donor&#x27;s facial tissue, they paid special attention to maintaining arteries, veins, and nerves, as well as soft tissue and bony structures. The surgeons then connected facial graft vessels to the patient&#x27;s blood vessels in order to restore blood circulation in the reconstructed face before connecting arteries, veins and nerves in the 22-hour procedure. She had been disfigured to the point where she could not eat or breathe on her own as a result of a traumatic injury several years ago, which had left her without a nose, right eye and upper jaw. Doctors hoped the operation would allow her to regain her sense of smell and ability to smile, and said she had a &quot;clear understanding&quot; of the risks involved. Connie died 29 July 2020.
The second partial face transplant in the US took place at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston on 9 April 2009. During a 17-hour operation, a surgical team led by Bohdan Pomahač, replaced the nose, upper lip, cheeks, and roof of the mouth – along with corresponding muscles, bones and nerves – of James Maki, age 59. Maki&#x27;s face was severely injured after falling onto the electrified third rail at a Boston subway station in 2005. In May 2009, he made a public media appearance and declared he was happy with the result. This procedure was also shown in the eighth episode of the ABC documentary series Boston Med.

The first full face transplant performed in the US was done on a construction worker named Dallas Wiens in March 2011. He was burned in an electrical accident in 2008. This operation, performed by Bohdan Pomahač and BWH plastic surgery team, was paid for with the help of the US defense department. They hope to learn from this procedure and use what they learn to help soldiers with facial injuries. One of the top benefits of the surgery was that Dallas has regained his sense of smell.

The Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital transplant team led by Bohdan Pomahač, performed the nation&#x27;s second full face transplant on patient Mitch Hunter of Speedway, Indiana. Hunter, who is a US war veteran, was left disfigured in a car accident, burning about 94% of his face. It was the third face transplant procedure to be performed at BWH and the fourth face transplant in the country. The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace the full facial area of patient Mitch Hunter including the nose, eyelids, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them and provide sensation. Mitch Hunter was a passenger in a single cab pick-up truck, upon exiting the vehicle and pulling another passenger off a downed line, Hunter was then struck by a 10,000-volt 7-amp power line for a little under five minutes. The electricity entered his lower left leg, with the majority exiting his face, leaving him severely disfigured. He also lost part of his lower left leg, below the knee, and lost two digits on his right hand (pinkie and ring finger). Hunter has regained almost 100% of his normal sensation back in his face and his only complaint is that he looks too much like his older brother.

57-year-old Charla Nash, who was mauled by a chimpanzee named Travis in 2009, after the owner gave the chimp Xanax and wine. She underwent a 20-hour full face transplant in May 2011 at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. Nash&#x27;s full face transplant was the third surgery of its kind performed in the United States, all at the same hospital.

In March 2012, a face transplant was completed at the University of Maryland Medical Center and R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center under the leadership of plastic surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez and his team (Amir Dorafshar, Michael Christy, Branko Bojovic and Daniel Borsuk). The recipient was 37-year-old Richard Norris, who had sustained a facial gunshot injury in 1997. This transplant included all facial and anterior neck skin, both jaws, and the tongue.

In September 2014, another face transplant was performed by the Cleveland Clinic group. The patient had had complex trauma that masked the development of a rare type of autoimmune disease (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and pyoderma gengrenosum) affecting the face. It was the first face transplant in a patient with an autoimmune disease involving the craniofacial region. Prior to surgery, an analysis of renal transplant outcomes in granulomatosis with polyangiitis was conducted to evaluate allograft outcomes in these cohorts. That literature established feasibility and encouraged the Cleveland Clinic team to proceed with the surgery. The intervention was reported successful up to three years post-transplantation.

In August 2015, a face transplant was completed at the NYU Langone Medical Center under the leadership of the chair of plastic surgery Eduardo D. Rodriguez and his team. A 41-year-old retired fireman named Patrick Hardison received the face of cyclist David Rodebaugh.

In June 2016, a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, physicians and other health professionals completed a near-total face transplant at Mayo Clinic&#x27;s Rochester campus. Patient Andrew Sandness, a 32-year-old from eastern Wyoming, had devastating facial injuries from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2006. The surgery, which spanned more than 50 hours, restored Sandness&#x27; nose, upper and lower jaw, palate, teeth, cheeks, facial muscles, oral mucosa, some of the salivary glands and the skin of his face (from below the eyelids to the neck and from ear to ear). The care team led by Samir Mardini, and Hatem Amer, the surgical director and medical director, respectively, for the Mayo Clinic Essam and Dalal Obaid Center for Reconstructive Transplant Surgery, devoted more than 50 Saturdays over years to rehearsing the surgery, using sets of cadaver heads to transplant the face of one to the other. They used 3-D imaging and virtual surgery to plot out the bony cuts so the donor&#x27;s face would fit perfectly on the transplant recipient. Today, in addition to his physical transformation, Sandness can smell again, breathe normally and eat foods that were off-limits for a decade.

In a 31-hour operation starting on 4 May 2017, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic transplanted a face donated from Adrea Schneider, who had died of a drug overdose, to Katie Stubblefield, whose face had been disfigured in a suicide attempt by rifle on 25 March 2014. , Katie is the youngest person in the United States to have had a face transplant, age 21 at the time. Surgeons originally planned to leave her cheeks, eyebrows, eyelids, most of her forehead, and the sides of her face alone. However, because the donor face was larger and darker than Katie&#x27;s, they made the decision to transplant the donor&#x27;s full face. This holds the risk that in case of acute rejection in which the face must be removed, she would not have enough tissue for reconstructive surgery. Katie was featured on the cover of National Geographic in September 2018 for an article entitled &quot;The Story of a Face.&quot;

In July 2019, 68-year-old Robert Chelsea became the oldest person, as well as the first black person in the world, to receive a full face transplant. On 6 August 2013, Robert was involved in an horrific car accident, leaving burns over 75% of his body. The severe damage meant that Robert was missing significant facial elements such as a part of his nose, which limited his ability to eat and drink. Functionality was important to Robert and was a key reason behind his pursuit of the surgery. In 2016, a face transplant was first discussed. Yet, health care disparities have led to a lack of black organ donations. This meant that Robert waited two years to find a face that matched something close to his own complexion. The surgery was performed on 27 July 2019 at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital.

In February 2024, 30-year-old Derek Pfaff received a full-face transplant from an anonymous donor. Pfaff had previously shot himself in the face during a suicide attempt in March 2014, 10 years prior to the surgery. The results of the surgery were later revealed in November 2024.

=== Combined procedures ===
A number of combined VCA procedures, such as bilateral hand transplants, have been described in the literature and media sources. These combined procedures also include attempts at triple-limb and quadruple-limb transplants, however, only three face transplants have been attempted in combination with other allografts.

==== France ====
In 2009, Laurent Lantieri and his team attempted a face and bilateral hand transplant on a 37-year-old man who sustained extensive injuries during a self-immolation attempt one year prior. The patient ultimately died of anoxic brain injury two months after his initial transplant during surgical management of infectious and vascular complications. Autopsy revealed no signs of rejection in any of the allografts.

==== United States ====
On 12 August 2020, at NYU Langone Health in New York, New York, Eduardo D. Rodriguez led a team of over 140 personnel in successfully transplanting the face and bilateral hands of a brain dead donor onto 22-year-old Joe DiMeo, who sustained disfiguring burns after a car accident in 2018. The procedure lasted approximately 23 hours, and involved the entire facial soft tissue (extending from the anterior hairline to the neck, including the eyelids, nose, lips, and ears, along with strategic skeletal components), as well as both hands at the distal forearm level.

Charla Nash&#x27;s face transplant, described above, also initially included bilateral hands from the same donor. Circulation to Nash&#x27;s transplanted hands was compromised after she was started on vasopressors as part of treatment for sepsis. The hands were ultimately amputated, however the patient survived, as did her facial allograft.

In May 2023, a team of 140 doctors at NYU Langone Health successfully conducted the first combination eye transplant and partial face transplant. The patient, a 46-year-old linesman, was electrocuted by high voltage wires in 2021 causing the loss of the lower portion of his face and his left eye. The eye, while not restoring vision to the patient, has successfully received blood flow to the retina.

==Ethics, surgery and post-operation treatment==
The procedure consists of a series of operations requiring rotating teams of specialists. With issues of tissue type, age, sex, and skin color taken into consideration, the patient&#x27;s face is removed and replaced (sometimes including the underlying fat, nerves, blood vessels, bones, and/or musculature). The surgery may last anywhere from 8 to 36 hours, followed by a 10- to 14-day hospital stay.

There has been a substantial amount of ethical debate surrounding the operation and its performance. The main issue is that, as noted below, the procedure entails submitting otherwise physically healthy people to potentially fatal, lifelong immunosuppressant therapy. So far, four people have died of complications related to the procedure. Citing the comments of various plastic surgeons and medical professionals from France and Mexico, anthropologist Samuel Taylor-Alexander suggests that the operation has been infused with nationalist import, which is ultimately influencing the decision-making and ethical judgements of the involved parties. His most recent research suggests the face transplant community needs to do more in order to ensure that the experiential knowledge of face transplant recipients is included in the ongoing evaluation of the field. As of October 2019, the AboutFace Project , funded by a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship awarded to Dr Fay Bound Alberti, is exploring these debates as part of its wider research into the emotional and cultural history of face transplants. The AboutFace project has entered its second phase as Interface, a research project which explores the relationship between identity, emotion, and communication, as revealed through the human face.

After the procedure, a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressive drugs is necessary to suppress the patient&#x27;s own immune systems and prevent rejection. Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of developing life-threatening infections, kidney damage, and cancer. The surgery may result in complications such as infections that could damage the transplanted face and require a second transplant or reconstruction with skin grafts.

<text>PSR B1919+21 is a pulsar with a period of 1.3373 seconds and a pulse width of 0.04 seconds. Discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell on 28 November 1967, it is the first discovered radio pulsar. The power and regularity of the signals were briefly thought to resemble an extraterrestrial beacon, leading the source to be nicknamed LGM, later LGM-1 (for &quot;little green men&quot;).

The original designation of this pulsar was CP 1919, which stands for Cambridge Pulsar at RA . It is also known as PSR J1921+2153 and is located in the constellation of Vulpecula.

== Discovery ==
In 1967, a radio signal was detected using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, UK, by Jocelyn Bell Burnell. The signal had a -second period (not in 1967, but in 1991) and 0.04-second pulsewidth. It originated at celestial coordinates right ascension, +21° declination. It was detected by individual observation of miles of graphical data traces. Due to its almost perfect regularity, it was at first assumed to be spurious noise, but this hypothesis was promptly discarded. The discoverers jokingly named it &quot;little green men 1&quot; (&quot;LGM-1&quot;), considering that it may have originated from an extraterrestrial civilization, but Bell Burnell soon ruled out extraterrestrial life as a source after discovering a similar signal from another part of the sky.

The original signal turned out to be radio emissions from the pulsar CP 1919, and was the first one recognized as such. Bell Burnell noted that other scientists could have discovered pulsars before her, but their observations were either ignored or disregarded. Researchers Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle identified this astronomical object as a rapidly rotating neutron star immediately upon their announcement.

Before the nature of the signal was determined, the researchers, Bell Burnell and her PhD supervisor Antony Hewish, considered the possibility of extraterrestrial life:

We did not really believe that we had picked up signals from another civilization, but obviously the idea had crossed our minds and we had no proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission. It is an interesting problem – if one thinks one may have detected life elsewhere in the universe[,] how does one announce the results responsibly? Who does one tell first?
== Nobel Prize controversy ==
When Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1974 for their work in radio astronomy and pulsars, Fred Hoyle, Hewish&#x27;s fellow astronomer, argued that Jocelyn Bell Burnell should have been a co-recipient of the prize.

In 2018, Bell won the $3-Million Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for her work.

== Cultural references ==
The English post-punk band Joy Division used an image of CP 1919&#x27;s radio pulses on the cover of their 1979 debut album, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;.

German-born British composer Max Richter wrote a piece inspired by the discovery of CP1919 titled &quot;Journey (CP1919)&quot;.

The English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys used a sound based on the pulses in their music video for &quot;Four Out of Five.&quot;

<text>Splenocytes are white blood cells that reside in the spleen and are involved in functions of the spleen, such as filtering blood and the immune response.

Splenocytes consist of a variety of cell populations such as T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, which have different immune functions.

== Overview ==

Splenocytes are spleen cells and consist of leukocytes like B and T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The spleen is split into red and white pulp regions with the marginal zone separating the two areas. The red pulp is involved with filtering blood and recycling iron, while the white pulp is involved in the immune response.

The red pulp contains macrophages that phagocytose old or damaged red blood cells.

The white pulp contains separate compartments for B and T cells called the B cell zone (BCZ) and the T cell zone (TCZ). B cells make antibodies to fight off bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and T cells are activated in response to antigens.

The marginal zone (MZ) separates the red and white pulp regions and contains macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. MZ macrophages remove some types of blood-borne bacteria and viruses. MZ B and dendritic cells are involved in antigen processing and presentation to lymphocytes in the white pulp.

<text>Sabine ( ) is a lunar impact crater that forms a nearly matching pair with Ritter to the northwest. The two rims are separated by a distance of only a couple of kilometers. To the west is the bowl-shaped crater Schmidt, and farther to the north are Manners and Arago. Its diameter is 30 km. It was named after Irish physicist and astronomer Edward Sabine.

==Description==
The outer rim of this crater is roughly circular and relatively featureless. The interior floor has a pair of small craterlets and a central rise. There is a ridge at the western edge of the floor that is concentric with the inner wall.

About 85 km to the east-southeast is &#x27;Statio Tranquillitatis&#x27; (Tranquility Base), the landing site of the Apollo 11 mission and the first human beings to step on the Moon.

Ranger 8 flew over Sabine prior to impact in Mare Tranquilitatis.

Both Sabine and Ritter were originally believed to be calderas rather than impact craters. In &quot;To A Rocky Moon&quot;, lunar geologist Don E. Wilhelms summarized: &quot;They are identical twins in morphology and size (29-30 km). They lack radial rim ejecta and secondary craters despite their apparent youth. They are positioned at the presumably active edge of a mare. They are even aligned along graben, the Hypatia rilles. Most significant, they lack deep floors recognized since the days of Gilbert as diagnostic of impacts.&quot; However, after the Apollo landings were complete, it was realized that &quot;all craters inside basins suffer enhanced isostatic uplift,&quot; because &quot;the thin crust and greater heat inside basins lower the viscosity of the craters&#x27; substrate, allowing it to reach isostasy with its surroundings more quickly than can other craters.&quot;

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sabine.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU, after the three astronauts of Apollo 11.
* Sabine B — &quot;See&quot; Aldrin.
* Sabine D — &quot;See&quot; Collins.
* Sabine E — &quot;See&quot; Armstrong.

A crater near the southeast rim of Sabine was referred to as &quot;Dark Crater&quot; by the Apollo 11 astronauts.

<text>Secchi is a small lunar impact crater formation on the northwest edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after the 19th-century Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi. To the northeast is the crater Taruntius. The western rim is joined with a section of the minor Montes Secchi range. The rim of this crater has been opened in the northern and southern ends, leaving two curved ridges facing each other across the crater floor. To the south is a pair of rilles designated the Rimae Secchi. These lie near the edge of the mare, and have a combined length of about 40 kilometers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Secchi.

<text>William Cleland (c. 166121 August 1689) was a Scottish poet and soldier.

William was the son of Thomas Cleland, gamekeeper to the Marquess of Douglas, chief of the House of Douglas. He was probably brought up on the Douglas estate, centred at Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, and was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s University. Immediately on leaving college he joined the army of the Covenanters, and was present at the Battle of Drumclog, where, says Robert Wodrow, some attributed to Cleland the manoeuvre which led to the victory.

He also fought at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. He and his brother James were described in a royal proclamation of 16 June 1679, among the leaders of the insurgents. He escaped to Holland, but in 1685 was again in Scotland in connection with the abortive invasion led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. He escaped once more, to return in 1688 as agent for William III of England (William of Orange).

He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Cameronian regiment raised from the Marquess&#x27; tenantry and a minority of the western Covenanters who consented to serve under William II. The Cameronians were entrusted with the defence of Dunkeld, which they held against the fierce assault of the Jacobites on 21 August at the Battle of Dunkeld where William Cleland was killed. His Major was wounded and the command fell to George Munro. The defeat of the Jacobites at Dunkeld ended the Jacobite rising, but Cleland fell in the struggle from gunshot wounds to the head and liver.

His &quot;Collection of several Poems and Verses composed upon various occasions&quot; was published posthumously in 1697. Of &quot;Hullo, my fancie, whither wilt thou go?&quot; only the last nine stanzas are by Cleland. His poems have small literary merit, and are written, not in pure Lowland Scots, but in English. with a large admixture of Scottish words. The longest and most important of them are the mock poems &quot;On the Expedition of the Highland Host who came to destroy the western shires in winter 1678&quot; and &quot;On the clergie when they met to consult about taking the Test in the year 1681&quot;.

<text>Silberschlag is a small, circular Impact crater in the central portion of the Moon. It was named after German astronomer Johann Silberschlag. It lies between the craters Agrippa to the southwest and Julius Caesar to the northeast. Silberschlag is bowl-shaped and is joined at the northern rim by a small ridge.

Just to the north is the prominent Rima Ariadaeus, a wide, linear rille that runs toward the east-southeast. This cleft is about 220 kilometers in length, and continues to the edge of Mare Tranquillitatis to the east.

<text>The Valley is a sports stadium in Charlton, London, England with a capacity of 27,111, which has been the home of Charlton Athletic Football Club since the 1920s, with a period of exile between 1985 and 1992.

The stadium is served by Charlton railway station, which is less than a five-minute walk away from the stadium. An alternative is to use the Jubilee line, exiting at North Greenwich, and changing for route 161, 472 and 486 buses, which stop outside the stadium.

==History==
In Charlton&#x27;s early years, the club had a nomadic existence, using several different grounds between its formation in 1905 and the beginning of World War I in 1914. The Valley dates from 1919, at a time when Charlton were moderately successful and looking for a new home. Fred Barned, the club’s honorary chairman, found an abandoned sand and chalk pit in Charlton, but did not have sufficient funds to fully develop the site. An army of volunteer Charlton supporters dug out a flat area for the pitch at the bottom of the chalk pit and used the excavated material to build up makeshift stands. The ground&#x27;s name most likely comes from its original valley-like appearance.

The club played its first game at the ground before any seats, or even terraces, were installed. There was simply a roped-off pitch with the crowd standing or sitting on the adjoining earthworks. The unique circumstances of the ground&#x27;s initial construction led to an unusually intense bond between the club&#x27;s supporters and the site that still exists.

In the 1923–24 season, Charlton played at The Mount stadium in Catford but in a much more highly populated area. A proposed merger with Catford South End FC fell through and so Charlton moved back to the Valley.

In 1967, Len Silver the promoter at Hackney made an application to open Charlton as a British League speedway club, and plans were proposed to construct a track around the perimeter of the football pitch. The application was enthusiastically supported initially, but was eventually ruled out on the grounds of noise nuisance.

For many years, the Valley was one of the largest Football League grounds in Britain, although its highest maximum capacity of 75,000 was only half the capacity of Glasgow&#x27;s Hampden Park. However, Charlton&#x27;s long absence from the top level of English football prevented much-needed renovation, because funds dried up and attendances fell. Charlton were relegated from the First Division in 1957 and did not return until 1986. In 1972, the club was relegated to the Third Division for the first time in the post-war era.

In the early 1980s, the club&#x27;s debts led to it almost going out of business. A consortium of supporters successfully acquired the club in 1984, but the Valley remained in the possession of the ownership of the former owner, and the club was unable to finance the improvements needed to meet new safety requirements. Shortly after the start of the 1985–86 season, Charlton left the Valley, entering into an agreement with Crystal Palace to share the latter&#x27;s Selhurst Park facilities, the first official groundsharing arrangement in the Football League in 36 years.

In 1988, the ownership of the club and the Valley were again united and, in a &quot;grass roots&quot; effort that harked back to the ground&#x27;s initial construction, thousands of supporters volunteered to clean the venue, eventually burning the debris in a huge bonfire on the pitch. By that time, however, the large terraces were no longer seen as desirable or safe. Charlton Athletic supporters proposed to completely rebuild the stadium so that the club could return there at the beginning of the 1990s. However, the Greenwich Borough Council overwhelmingly turned down the plans to renovate the ground. Club supporters formed their own local political party, the Valley Party, in response to the council&#x27;s decision. The party ran candidates for all but two Greenwich Council seats, sparing the two councillors who had approved the new stadium plans. The party won almost 15,000 votes in the 1990 local elections, successfully pressuring the council to approve the plans for the new stadium.

In 1991, construction began on the new Valley, and the club moved from Selhurst Park to West Ham&#x27;s Upton Park. It was originally hoped that the club would return to the stadium before Christmas that year, but the re-opening faced a series of delays before finally occurring in December 1992. Since then, the ground has undergone some remarkable changes. The north, east and west sides have almost been completely rebuilt, which gave the ground a capacity of over 27,000 by December 2001, when Charlton were in the second season of a stay in the FA Premier League which would last for seven seasons. The club had ambitions to extend the ground&#x27;s capacity to over 40,000 by expanding the east side and completely rebuilding the south side, but these plans were abandoned after Charlton were relegated from the Premier League in 2007.

In 2004, the Unity Cup was held at the Valley, with Nigeria winning the competition.

Charlton&#x27;s former owner Roland Duchâtelet retained ownership of The Valley after selling the football club in 2020, but subsequent owner, Thomas Sandgaard, negotiated a lease for the club to use the stadium until January 2035.

On 24 September 2022, the Valley hosted a charity match, in which the YouTube group Sidemen played against other major YouTube personalities who formed the YouTube All-Stars, which included Darren Watkins, also known as IShowSpeed. Mark Clattenburg was the match referee. The match, the Sidemen&#x27;s third one at the Valley, ended 8-7 for the Sidemen and raised over £1,000,000 split between the Teenage Cancer Trust, CALM, Rays of Sunshine and M7 Education charities.

In March 2024, Charlton announced their intention to build a safe standing area which would be completed over the summer. Additional to this, the club had worked worked alongside the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust to implement one of the UK&#x27;s first &#x27;Youth Specific Sections&#x27; for fans. In 2024, it was also announced a new hybrid pitch would be installed as part of a six-figure investment by the club&#x27;s owners, and a £750,000 grant from the Premier League Stadium Fund. As part of the investment, the Charlton women&#x27;s team would play all of their home matches at The Valley for the first time. Their first match at The Valley took place on 28 April 2024, ending in a 2–0 victory against Southampton in front of 985 fans.

==Stands==

===The Covered End===
Capacity: 9,743
The North Stand was built as a replacement for the &#x27;covered end&#x27;, and is still called by this name. It was built during the 2001–02 season as part of the developments to bring the Valley&#x27;s capacity to 26,500 after promotion to the Premier League in 2000. The North Stand houses the most vocal supporters in the ground in particular the upper tier alongside a drum, along with restaurants and executive suites.

A safe standing area will be installed in the Covered End Upper ahead of Charlton&#x27;s 2024-25 season, it will have a capacity of 1,064. The club has also received provisional permission to install a safe standing area in the Covered End Lower.

===Alan Curbishley Stand===
Capacity: 5,802

The East Stand was constructed during the 1993–94 season and fully completed in 1994. As part of the first development to the ground since the return in 1992, it replaced the massive east terrace, which had remained closed and prohibited from use since the mid-1980s after the Bradford City stadium fire. The East Stand consists of a single tier of seats and houses the television gantry, and also has numerous executive boxes. Occasionally, for FA and League Cup matches, part of the East Stand is used to house away supporters if the demand for away team tickets is high. On 9 April 2021, the club announced that from the start of 2021–22 season, the stand would be renamed to the Alan Curbishley Stand in honour of the former player and manager, and to celebrate the 30th anniversary of when Curbishley was appointed manager of the club - a role he held from 1991 to 2006.

===West Stand===
Capacity: 8,097

The West Stand was built in 1998 after Charlton&#x27;s first promotion to the Premier League and is also two tiered. This is the main stand at the Valley with the largest capacity, and also houses the club&#x27;s offices, as well as the director&#x27;s box, board room dug-outs, changing rooms and the commercial centre (ticket office). There are also many conferencing rooms in this stand which are used for official and community events. There is a large statue of Sam Bartram, (considered to be Charlton&#x27;s finest player) at the entrance of the West Stand.

===Jimmy Seed Stand===
Capacity: 3,469

The Jimmy Seed (or South) Stand is the oldest part of the ground, and dates from the early 1980s. This stand is named after Charlton&#x27;s manager, Jimmy Seed (1895–1966) – with whom Charlton won the FA Cup in 1947. This stand has a capacity of around 3,000 and hosts the away supporters at games. It is also the only part of the Valley with a supporting pillar.

<text>Sosigenes is a lunar impact crater on the west edge of Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 17 km. It was named after ancient Greek astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria. It lies to the east of the large walled plain Julius Caesar. The crater rim has a high albedo, making it relatively bright. It has a small central rise at the midpoint of the floor.

To the east on the mare is a formation of parallel rilles designated the Rimae Sosigenes. These follow a course to the north, and have a length of about 150 kilometers. The small, bowl-shaped crater Sosignes A lies across one of these rilles.

<text>Charles Lee Lewes (1740 – 13 July 1803) was an English actor.

==Biography==
He was born the son of a hosier in London. After attending a school at Ambleside he returned to London, where he found employment as a postman. In about 1760 he went on the stage in the provinces, and some three years later began to appear in minor parts at Covent Garden Theatre. His first role of importance was that of Young Marlow in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, at its production of that comedy in 1773, when he delivered an epilogue specially written for him by Goldsmith.

He remained a member of the Covent Garden company until 1783, appearing in many parts, among which were Fag in &quot;The Rivals&quot;, which he created, and Sir Anthony Absolute in the same comedy. In 1783 he removed to Drury Lane, where he assumed the Shakespearian rôles of Touchstone, Lucio, and Falstaff. In 1787 he left London for Edinburgh, where he gave recitations, including Cowper&#x27;s &quot;John Gilpin&quot;. For a short time in 1792 Lewes assisted Stephen Kemble in the management of the Dundee Repertory Theatre; in the following year he went to Dublin, but he was financially unsuccessful and suffered imprisonment for debt. He employed his time in compiling his memoirs, published after his death by his son. He was also the author of some dramatic sketches. Lewes was three times married; the philosopher George Henry Lewes was his grandson.

==Family==
Charles Lee Lewes was also the name of George Henry Lewes&#x27; eldest son, who curated his father&#x27;s extensive library upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1878.

<text>John Tiplady Carrodus (1836–1895) was an English violinist.

==Life==

Carrodus was born on 20 January 1836, at Keighley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He took violin lessons from his father Thomas Carrodus, who was a barber and music-seller. He made his first appearance as a violinist at the age of nine, and before the London public four years later. He had the advantage of studying between the ages of twelve and eighteen at Stuttgart, with Bernhard Molique. He also &quot;became a &#x27;follower of Spohr&#x27;, who expressed his admiration for the Englishman&#x27;s playing.&quot;

On his return to Britain in 1853 Sir Michael Costa got him engagements in the leading orchestras. He was a member of the Covent Garden opera orchestra from 1855. He made his debut as a solo player at a concert given on 22 April 1863 by the Musical Society of London, and succeeded Prosper Sainton as leader at Covent Garden in 1869. He led the Covent Garden orchestra for twenty-five years. He also took over from Sainton as the Leader of the Three Choirs Festival orchestra in 1882.

He taught at the National Training School of Music, the Croydon Conservatoire of Music, the Guildhall School of Music, the Royal Academy of Music, and Trinity College, London. He has the distinction of being the first president of the College of Violinists. He was an early proponent of the violin recital. His concert at St James&#x27;s Hall on 20 January 1881, which included the works of Molique and Spohr, is &quot;widely recognized as the first public violin recital.&quot;

For many years, Carrodus had led the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society and those of the great provincial festivals. The coveted &quot;Carrodus&quot; violin, made by Guarneri in 1743, was said to have belonged to Carrodus.

Carrodus was constantly striving &quot;for improving the standard of string playing in English orchestras.&quot; He was famous for setting extremely high standards in his own playing and in that of his pupils. Lilian Baylis was one of his notable students. He taught her violin at the Royal Academy of Music.

In addition to editions of the treatises of Loder and Spohr, Carrodus published his own &quot;Chats to violin students on how to study the violin.&quot; He published two violin solos and a , and was a very successful teacher. He edited a popular six-volume edition of violin duets for Pitman&#x27;s Sixpenny Musical Library.

He died at Hampstead, London on 13 July 1895 and was buried in a family grave on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>Stevinus is a lunar impact crater located in the southeast part of the Moon. To the southeast is the large crater Furnerius. Just to the northeast is Snellius and the Vallis Snellius crater valley. To the west-northwest lies Reichenbach. To the west-northwest of Stevinus is the tiny crater Stevinus A, a feature that possesses a small ray system and a displays a high albedo.

Stevinus has a high inner wall and a central peak at the midpoint of the interior floor. The inner walls are slumped, so that the side slopes down sharply, then more gradually. There are several small ridges on the floor, in addition to the peak. Due to its ray system, Stevinus is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

It is named for Simon Stevin, a 16th-century Belgian mathematician and engineer.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Stevinus.

<text>Strabo is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northeastern rim of the Moon. At this angle the crater appears oval in shape due to foreshortening. It is attached to the north rim of the walled plain De La Rue. To the west is the smaller crater Thales. To the north is a chain of three comparably sized craters designated Strabo L, Strabo B, and Strabo N.

The inner rim of Strabo is terraced, with a small crater lying across the eastern wall. The interior has been flooded in the past by lava, and is now relatively flat.

<text>Sulpicius Gallus is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater that lies near the southwestern edge of the Mare Serenitatis. The crater is named after the 2nd century BC Roman astronomer Gaius Sulpicius Gallus.

About 10 kilometers to the south and east is the Montes Haemus range that forms the edge of the Serenitatis basin. This crater has a relatively high albedo, with a sharp-edged rim that displays little appearance of wear. There is a small rise at the midpoint. Recent deposits of highland material have been observed within the crater interior. This material was observed to be orange by Apollo 17 astronauts during their LMP ascent.
To the northwest is a rille system designated the Rimae Sulpicius Gallus. These extend to the northwest for a distance of about 90 kilometers, curving and branching out to follow the edge of the mare.

<doc id="1000117" wikidata="Q1128781" url="?curid=1000117" title="Phono-semantic matching">
<text>Phono-semantic matching (PSM) is the incorporation of a word into one language from another, often creating a neologism, where the word&#x27;s non-native quality is hidden by replacing it with phonetically and semantically similar words or roots from the adopting language. Thus the approximate sound and meaning of the original expression in the source language are preserved, though the new expression (the PSM – the phono-semantic match) in the target language may sound native.

Phono-semantic matching is distinct from calquing, which includes (semantic) translation but does not include phonetic matching (i.e., retention of the approximate sound of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existent word or morpheme in the target language).

Phono-semantic matching is also distinct from homophonic translation, which retains the sound of a word but not the meaning.

==History==
The term &quot;phono-semantic matching&quot; was introduced by linguist and revivalist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann. It challenged Einar Haugen&#x27;s classic typology of lexical borrowing (loanwords). While Haugen categorized borrowing into either substitution or importation, camouflaged borrowing in the form of PSM is a case of &quot;simultaneous substitution and importation.&quot; Zuckermann proposed a new classification of multisourced neologisms, words deriving from two or more sources at the same time. Examples of such mechanisms are phonetic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phono-semantic matching.

Zuckermann concludes that language planners, for example members of the Academy of the Hebrew Language, employ the very same techniques used in folk etymology by laymen, as well as by religious leaders. He urges lexicographers and etymologists to recognize the widespread phenomena of camouflaged borrowing and multisourced neologization and not to force one source on multi-parental lexical items.

==Examples==
===Arabic===
Zuckermann analyses the evolution of the word &quot;artichoke&quot;. Beginning in Arabic () &quot;the artichoke&quot;, it was adapted into Andalusian Arabic &quot;alxarshofa&quot;, then Old Spanish &quot;alcarchofa&quot;, then Italian &quot;alcarcioffo&quot;, then Northern Italian &quot;arcicioffo&quot; &gt; &quot;arciciocco&quot; &gt; &quot;articiocco&quot;, then phonetically realised in English as &quot;artichoke&quot;. The word was eventually &quot;phono-semantically matched&quot; back into colloquial Levantine Arabic (for example in Syria, Lebanon and Israel) as (), consisting of () &quot;earthly&quot; and () &quot;thorny&quot;.

Arabic has made use of phono-semantic matching to replace blatantly imported new terminology with a word derived from an existing triliteral root. Examples are:
===Dutch===
A number of PSMs exist in Dutch as well. One notable example is (&quot;hammock&quot;), which is a modification of Spanish , also the source of the English word. Natively, the word is transparently analysed as a &quot;hang-mat&quot;, which aptly describes the object. Similarly:
* In (&quot;anchovy&quot;), the second part was modified to resemble (&quot;fish&quot;), although the word originates in Spanish &quot;anchova&quot;;
* In (&quot;scurvy&quot;), the word parts were modified to resemble (stem of , tear open) and (&quot;belly, stomach&quot;), although the word originates in Middle Low German ;
* In (an alternative name for , &quot;February&quot;), the first part was modified to resemble (&quot;gather wood&quot;), although the word originates in Latin &quot;spurcalia&quot;;
* In (a variety of apple with a very soft, thin, yellow skin), the word parts were modified to resemble (&quot;silken&quot;) and (&quot;shirt; small shirt; vest&quot;), although the word actually denotes the place Sydenham where the apple originates.
* Dutch dictionary &quot;Van Dale&quot; describes as a particularly notable example.
* Other examples are , , , , , , , and .

===English===
A few PSMs exist in English. The French word (&quot;Carthusian monastery&quot;) was translated to the English &quot;charterhouse&quot;. The French word , itself an adaptation of the Choctaw name for the bowfin, has likewise been Anglicized as , although it is unrelated to the pikes. The French name for the Osage orange, &quot;&quot; ( &quot;bow-wood&quot;), is sometimes rendered as &quot;bowdark&quot;. 

The second part of the word &quot;muskrat&quot; was altered to match &quot;rat&quot;, replacing the original form &quot;&quot;, which derives from an Algonquian (possibly Powhatan) word, &quot;muscascus&quot; (literally &quot;it is red&quot;), or from the Abenaki native word &quot;mòskwas&quot;.

The use of &quot;&quot; in Psalm 68 of the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; derives from phono-semantic matching between Latin and English &quot; &quot;.

===Finnish===
The Finnish compound word for &quot;jealous,&quot; , literally means &quot;black-socked&quot; ( &quot;black&quot; and &quot;sock&quot;). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish &quot;black-sick&quot;. The Finnish word fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish . Similar cases are &quot;hardworking person&quot;, literally &quot;work mole&quot;, from &quot;work ant&quot;, matching &quot;ant&quot; to &quot;mole&quot;; and &quot;clavus&quot;, literally &quot;extra toe&quot;, from &lt; &quot;dead thorn&quot;, matching &quot;extra&quot; to &quot;dead (archaic)&quot; and &quot;toe&quot; to &lt; &quot;thorn&quot;.

===German===
 &quot;applies the concepts of multisourced neologisation and, more generally, camouflaged borrowing, as established by to Modern German, pursuing a twofold aim, namely to underline the significance of multisourced neologisation for language contact theory and secondly to demonstrate that together with other forms of camouflaged borrowing it remains an important borrowing mechanism in contemporary German.&quot;

===Icelandic===
 demonstrate how Icelandic camouflages many English words by means of phono-semantic matching. For example, the Icelandic-looking word &quot;eyðni&quot;, meaning &quot;AIDS&quot;, is a PSM of the English acronym &quot;AIDS&quot;, using the pre-existent Icelandic verb &quot;eyða&quot;, meaning &quot;to destroy&quot;, and the Icelandic nominal suffix &quot;-ni&quot;. Similarly, the Icelandic word &quot;tækni&quot;, meaning &quot;technology, technique&quot;, derives from &quot;tæki&quot;, meaning &quot;tool&quot;, combined with the nominal suffix &quot;-ni&quot;, but is, in fact, a PSM of the Danish &quot;teknik&quot; (or of another derivative of Greek ), meaning &quot;technology, technique&quot;. &quot;Tækni&quot; was coined in 1912 by Dr Björn Bjarnarson from Viðfjörður in the East of Iceland. It had been in little use until the 1940s, but has since become common, as a lexeme and as an element in new formations, such as &quot;raftækni&quot;, lit. &quot;electrical technics&quot;, i.e. &quot;electronics&quot;, &quot;tæknilegur&quot; &quot;technical&quot; and &quot;tæknir&quot; &quot;technician&quot;. Other PSMs discussed in the article are &quot;beygla&quot;, &quot;bifra&quot; &quot;bifrari&quot;, &quot;brokkál&quot;, &quot;dapur&quot; &quot;dapurleiki&quot; - &quot;depurð&quot;, &quot;fjárfesta&quot; - &quot;fjárfesting&quot;, &quot;heila&quot;, &quot;guðspjall&quot;, &quot;ímynd&quot;, &quot;júgurð&quot;, &quot;korréttur&quot;, &quot;Létt og laggott&quot;, &quot;musl&quot;, &quot;pallborð&quot; &quot;pallborðsumræður&quot;, &quot;páfagaukur&quot;, &quot;ratsjá&quot;, &quot;setur&quot;, &quot;staða&quot;, &quot;staðall&quot; &quot;staðla&quot; &quot;stöðlun&quot;, &quot;toga&quot; &quot;togari&quot;, &quot;uppi&quot; and &quot;veira&quot;.

===Japanese===
In modern Japanese, loanwords are generally represented phonetically via katakana. However, in earlier times loanwords were often represented by kanji (Chinese characters), a process called when used for phonetic matching, or when used for semantic matching. Some of these continue to be used; the characters chosen may correspond to the sound, the meaning, or both.

In most cases the characters used were chosen only for their matching sound or only for their matching meaning. For example, in the word (sushi), the two characters are respectively read as and , but the character means &quot;one&#x27;s natural life span&quot; and means &quot;to administer&quot;, neither of which has anything to do with the food this is . Conversely, in the word () for &quot;tobacco&quot;, the individual kanji respectively mean &quot;smoke&quot; and &quot;herb&quot;, which corresponds to the meaning, while none of their possible readings have a phonetic relationship to the word this is .

In some cases, however, the kanji were chosen for both their semantic and phonetic values, a form of phono-semantic matching. A stock example is () for &quot;club&quot;, where the characters can be interpreted loosely in sequence as &quot;together-fun-place&quot; (which has since been borrowed into Chinese during the early 20th century with the same meaning, including the individual characters, but with a pronunciation that differs considerably from the original English and the Japanese, ). Another example is () for the Portuguese , a kind of raincoat. The characters can mean &quot;wings coming together&quot;, as the pointed resembles a bird with wings folded together.

===Mandarin Chinese===
PSM is frequently used in Mandarin borrowings. An example is the Taiwanese Mandarin word , which literally means &quot;powerful and hard&quot; and refers to Viagra, the drug for treating erectile dysfunction in men, manufactured by Pfizer.

Another example is the Mandarin form of World Wide Web, which is (), which satisfies &quot;www&quot; and literally means &quot;myriad dimensional net&quot;. The English word &quot;hacker&quot; has been borrowed into Mandarin as (, &quot;dark/wicked visitor&quot;).

Modern Standard Chinese / &quot;sonar&quot; uses the characters / &quot;sound&quot; and / &quot;receive, accept&quot;. The pronunciations and are phonetically somewhat similar to the two syllables of the English word. Chinese has a large number of homo/heterotonal homophonous morphemes, which would have been a better phonetic fit than , but not nearly as good semantically consider the syllable &#x27; (cf. &#x27;deliver, carry, give (as a present)&#x27;, &#x27;pine; loose, slack&#x27;, / &#x27;tower; alarm, attract&#x27; etc.), &#x27; (cf. &#x27;search&#x27;, &#x27;old man&#x27;, / &#x27;sour, spoiled&#x27; and many others) or &quot;&quot; (cf. &#x27;receive, accept&#x27;, &#x27;receive, accept&#x27;, &#x27;hand&#x27;, &#x27;head&#x27;, / &#x27;beast&#x27;, &#x27;thin&#x27; and so forth).

According to Zuckermann, PSM in Mandarin is common in:

* brand names, e.g., / , &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; translates to &quot;tasty [and] entertaining&quot;, / itself genericised to refer to any cola.
* computer jargon, e.g., the aforementioned word for &quot;World Wide Web&quot;.
* technological terms, e.g., the aforementioned word for &quot;sonar&quot;.
* toponyms, e.g., the name / , &quot;Belarus&quot; combines the word , &quot;White&quot; with the name / , &quot;Russia&quot;, therefore meaning &quot;White Russia&quot; just like the endonym &quot;&quot;.

From a monolingual Chinese view, Mandarin PSM is the &#x27;lesser evil&#x27; compared with Latin script (in digraphic writing) or code-switching (in speech). Zuckermann&#x27;s exploration of PSM in Standard Chinese and Meiji-period Japanese concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional: pleremic (&quot;full&quot; of meaning, e.g., logographic), cenemic (&quot;empty&quot; of meaning, e.g., phonographic - like a syllabary), and phono-logographic (simultaneously cenemic and pleremic). Zuckermann argues that Leonard Bloomfield&#x27;s assertion that &quot;a language is the same no matter what system of writing may be used&quot; is inaccurate. &quot;If Chinese had been written using roman letters, thousands of Chinese words would not have been coined, or would have been coined with completely different forms&quot;. Evidence of this can be seen in the Dungan language, a Chinese language that is closely related to Mandarin, but written phonetically in Cyrillic, where words are directly borrowed, often from Russian, without PSM.

A related practice is the translation of Western names into Chinese characters.

===Modern Hebrew===
Often in phono-semantic matching, the source language determines both the root word and the noun-pattern. This makes it difficult to determine the source language&#x27;s influence on the target language morphology. For example, &quot;the phono-semantic matcher of English &quot;dock&quot; with Israeli Hebrew &quot;mivdók&quot; could have usedafter deliberately choosing the phonetically and semantically suitable root &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;check&#x27; (Rabbinic) or &#x27;repair&#x27; (Biblical) the noun-patterns &quot;mi⌂⌂a⌂á&quot;, &quot;ma⌂⌂e⌂á&quot;, &quot;mi⌂⌂é⌂et&quot;, &quot;mi⌂⌂a⌂áim&quot; etc. (each ⌂ represents a slot where a radical is inserted). Instead, &quot;mi⌂⌂ó⌂&quot;, which was not highly productive, was chosen because its [o] makes the final syllable of &quot;mivdók&quot; sound like English &quot;dock&quot;.&quot;

===Miscellaneous===
The Hebrew name (&quot;Yərūšālayim&quot;) for Jerusalem is rendered as (&quot;Hierosóluma&quot;) in, e.g. Matthew 2:1. The first part corresponds to the Ancient Greek prefix (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;sacred, holy&quot;.

Old High German &quot;widarlōn&quot; (&quot;repayment of a loan&quot;) was rendered as &quot;widerdonum&quot; (&quot;reward&quot;) in Medieval Latin. The last part corresponds to the Latin &quot;donum&quot; (&quot;gift&quot;).

&quot;Viagra&quot;, a brand name which was suggested by Interbrand Wood (the consultancy firm hired by Pfizer), is itself a multisourced neologism, based on Sanskrit &quot;&quot; (&quot;tiger&quot;) but enhanced by the words &quot;vigour&quot; (i.e. strength) and &quot;Niagara&quot; (i.e. free/forceful flow).

Other than through Sinoxenic borrowings, Vietnamese employs phono-semantic matching less commonly than Chinese. Examples include (&quot;matrix&quot;, from the words for &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;battle array&quot;), (&quot;apply&quot;, from the words for &quot;press down&quot; and &quot;use&quot;), and (Huey P. Long, from &quot;yellow flying dragon&quot;, evoking the Huey P. Long Bridge).

==Motivations==
According to Zuckermann, PSM has various advantages from the point of view of a puristic language planner:

* recycling obsolete lexical items
* camouflaging foreign influence (for the native speaker in the future)
* facilitating initial learning (mnemonics) (for the contemporary learner/speaker)

Other motivations for PSM include the following:

* playfulness (cf. midrashic tradition of homiletic commentary, cf. the Jewish &quot;pilpul&quot;)
* Apollonianism (the wish to create order/meaningfulness, cf. folk etymology, etymythology, paronymic attraction)
* iconicity (the belief that there is something intrinsic about the sound of names; cf. phonaesthetics)
* political correctness / rejective lexical engineering
* attracting customers (in the case of brand names)

==Expressive loan==
An expressive loan is a loanword incorporated into the expressive system of the borrowing language, making it resemble native words or onomatopoeia. Expressive loanwords are hard to identify, and by definition, they follow the common phonetic sound change patterns poorly. Likewise, there is a continuum between &quot;pure&quot; loanwords and &quot;expressive&quot; loanwords. The difference to a folk etymology (or an eggcorn) is that a folk etymology is based on misunderstanding, whereas an expressive loan is changed on purpose, the speaker taking the loanword knowing full well that the descriptive quality is different from the original sound and meaning.

South-eastern Finnish, for example, has many expressive loans. The main source language, Russian, does not use the vowels &#x27;y&#x27;, &#x27;ä&#x27; or &#x27;ö&#x27; [y æ ø]. Thus, it is common to add these to redescriptivized loans to remove the degree of foreignness that the loanword would otherwise have. For example, &quot;tytinä&quot; &quot;brawn&quot; means &quot;wobblyness&quot;, and superficially it looks like a native construction, originating from the verb &quot;tutista&quot; &quot;to wobble&quot; added with a front vowel sound in the vowel harmony. However, it is expressivized from &quot;tyyteni&quot; (which is a confusing word as &quot;-ni&quot; is a possessive suffix), which in turn is a loanword from Russian &quot;stúden&#x27;&quot;. A somewhat more obvious example is &quot;tökötti&quot; &quot;sticky, tarry goo&quot;, which could be mistaken as a derivation from the onomatopoetic word &quot;tök&quot; (cf. the verb &quot;tökkiä&quot; &quot;to poke&quot;). However, it is an expressive loan of Russian &quot;d&#x27;ogot&quot;&#x27; &quot;tar&quot;.

The event was founded in 1981 by Isadore Sharp, who had contacted Terry in hospital by telegram and expressed his wishes to hold an annual run in Terry&#x27;s name to raise funds for cancer research. Sharp had lost his son to cancer in 1979. The event is held every year on the second Sunday following Labour Day. Since its inception, it has raised via the &#x27;Terry Fox Foundation&#x27; over $750 million (CAD). The run is informal which means that the distance often varies, usually between 5 and 15 kilometres; participation is considered to be more important than completing the set distance. There are also runs set up by schools of every level, often with shorter distances than the &quot;official&quot; ones.

The Terry Fox Run has no corporate sponsorship, in accordance with Terry Fox&#x27;s original wishes of not seeking fame or fortune from his endeavour. During his cross-Canada run, he rejected every endorsement he was offered (including from multinational corporations such as McDonald&#x27;s), as he felt that it would detract from his goal of creating public awareness. The Terry Fox Runs have no advertisements on any race related materials (such as T-shirts, banners, etc.).

==History==

The Terry Fox Foundation was founded in 1988 after it separated from the Canadian Cancer Society. Since its inception, The Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $800 million for cancer research. Currently, Terry Fox Runs take place every year with many participants from all over the world. The Run is a volunteer led, all-inclusive, non-competitive event with no corporate sponsorship, incentives or fundraising minimums. Fox laid out these wishes before his death in 1981.

In 2007 The Terry Fox Foundation created the Terry Fox Research Institute to conduct transnational research to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, The Terry Fox Foundation directed $27.7 million to its cancer research programs.

The Terry Fox Foundation has expanded beyond the traditional Run as well, by holding various other events. These events include National School Run Day, where schools throughout Canada hold a Run to commemorate Fox and raise funds, and The Great Canadian Hair &quot;Do&quot;, which is a fundraising event that can take place at any time of the year. Participants are able to make the event as creative as they want— shave their heads, dye their hair a wacky colour, include a manly leg wax, and recruit friends to shave their heads as well.

<text>Tacquet is a small, bowl-shaped crater that lies near the southern edge of Mare Serenitatis, in the northeast part of the Moon. The surface near the crater is marked by high-albedo ejecta. To the west is a system of rilles designated the Rimae Menelaus. Its diameter is 6.4 km. It was named after Brabantian mathematician André Tacquet (1612-1660).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tacquet.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Tacquet A — &quot;See&quot; Al-Bakri (crater).

<doc id="1000136" wikidata="Q863835" url="?curid=1000136" title="Reamer">
<text>A reamer is a type of rotary cutting tool used in metalworking. Precision reamers are designed to enlarge the size of a previously formed hole by a small amount but with a high degree of accuracy to leave smooth sides. There are also non-precision reamers which are used for more basic enlargement of holes or for removing burrs. The process of enlarging the hole is called reaming. There are many different types of reamer and they may be designed for use as a hand tool or in a machine tool, such as a milling machine or drill press.

==Construction==
A typical reamer consists of a set of parallel straight or helical cutting edges along the length of a cylindrical body. Each cutting edge is ground at a slight angle and with a slight undercut below the cutting edge. Reamers must combine both hardness in the cutting edges, for long life, and toughness, so that the tool does not fail under the normal forces of use. They should only be used to remove small amounts of material. This ensures a long life for the reamer and a superior finish to the hole.

The spiral may be clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on usage. For example, a tapered hand reamer with a clockwise spiral will tend to self feed as it is used, possibly leading to a wedging action and consequent breakage. A counter-clockwise spiral is therefore preferred even though the reamer is still turned in the clockwise direction.

For production machine tools, the shank type is usually one of the following: a standard taper (such as Morse or Brown &amp; Sharpe), a straight round shank to be held by a collet, or a straight round shank with a flat for a set screw, to be held by a solid toolholder. For hand tools, the shank end is usually a square drive, intended for use with the same type of wrench used to turn a tap for the cutting of screw threads.

== Reaming versus drilling to size ==
The geometry of a hole drilled in metal by a twist drill may not be accurate enough (close enough to a true cylinder of a certain precise diameter) and may not have the required smooth surface finish for certain engineering applications. Although modern twist drills can perform excellently in many cases—usually producing sufficiently accurate holes for most applications—sometimes the stringency of the requirements for the hole&#x27;s geometry and finish necessitate two operations: a drilling to slightly undersize, followed by reaming with a reamer. The planned difference between the drill diameter and the reamer diameter is called an &quot;allowance&quot;. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.) The allowance should be &lt; 0.2 mm (.008 in) for soft materials and &lt; 0.13 mm (.005 in) for hard materials. Larger allowances can damage the reamer. The drilled hole should not be enlarged by more than 5% of the drilled diameter. Drilling followed by reaming generally produces hole geometry and finish that is as close to theoretical perfection as possible. (The other methods of hole creation that approach nearest to perfection under certain conditions are boring [especially single-point boring] and internal cylindrical grinding.)

==Types==

=== Chucking reamer ===

Chucking reamers, or machine reamers, are the most common type of reamer used in lathes, drill presses, and screw machines that provide a smooth finish to the hole. They come in a variety of flutes and cuts (e.g. right hand cut, left hand spiral, straight flute) as well as different shank types. Chucking reamers can be manufactured with a straight shank or morse taper shank.

===Adjustable hand reamer===

An adjustable hand reamer can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts at each end varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they have a tendency to chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a split bush or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn &quot;drop&quot; into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to &quot;size&quot; a hole.

===Straight reamer===
A straight reamer is used to make only a minor enlargement to a hole. The entry end of the reamer will have a slight taper, the length of which will depend on its type. This produces a self centering action as it enters the raw hole. The larger proportion of the length will be of a constant diameter.

Reamed holes are used to create holes of precise circularity and size, for example with tolerances of -0/+0.02 mm(.0008&quot;) This will allow the force fitting of locating dowel pins, which need not be otherwise retained in the body holding them. Other holes, reamed slightly larger in other parts, will fit these pins accurately, but not so tightly as to make disassembly difficult. This type of alignment is common in the joining of split crankcase halves such as are used in motorcycle motors and boxer type engines. After joining the halves, the assembled case may then be line bored (using what is in effect a large diameter reamer), and then disassembled for placement of bearings and other parts. The use of reamed dowel holes is typical in any machine design, where any two locating parts have to be located and mated accurately to one another - typically as indicated above, to within 0.02 mm or less than .001&quot;.

Another use of reamed holes is to receive a specialized bolt that has an unthreaded shoulder - also called a shoulder bolt. This type of bolt is commonly used to replace hot peened rivets during the seismic retrofit of structures.

====Hand reamer====
A hand reamer has a longer taper or &quot;lead in&quot; at the front than a machine reamer. This is to compensate for the difficulty of starting a hole by hand power alone. It also allows the reamer to start straight and reduce the risk of breakage. The flutes may be straight or spiral.

====Machine reamer====

A machine reamer only has a very slight lead in. Because the reamer and work piece are pre-aligned by the machine there is no risk of it wandering off course. In addition the constant cutting force that can be applied by the machine ensures that it starts cutting immediately. Spiral flutes have the advantage of clearing the swarf automatically but are also available with straight flutes as the amount of swarf generated during a reaming operation should be very small.

===Rose reamer===
A rose reamer has no relief on the periphery and is offset by a front taper to prevent binding. They are secondarily used as softing reamers.

===Shell reamer===
Shell reamers are designed for reaming bearing and other similar items. They are fluted almost their whole length.

===Tapered reamer===

A precision tapered reamer is used to make a tapered hole to later receive a tapered pin.
A taper pin is a self tightening device due to the shallow angle of the taper. They may be driven into the tapered hole such that removal can only be done with a hammer and punch. They are &quot;sized&quot; by a number sequence (for example, a No.4 reamer would use No.4 taper pins).
Such precision joints are used in aircraft assembly and are frequently used to join the two or more wing sections used in a sailplane. These may be re-reamed one or more times during the aircraft&#x27;s useful life, with an appropriately oversized pin replacing the previous pin.

====Morse taper reamer====

A morse taper reamer is used manually to finish morse taper sleeves. These sleeves are a tool used to hold machine cutting tools or holders in the spindles of machines such as a drill or milling machine. The reamer shown is a finishing reamer. A roughing reamer would have serrations along the flutes to break up the thicker chips produced by the heavier cutting action used for it.

===Combination reamer===
A combination reamer has two or more cutting surfaces. The combination reamer is precision ground into a pattern that resembles the part&#x27;s multiple internal diameters. The advantage of using a combination reamer is to reduce the number of turret operations, while more precisely holding depths, internal diameters and concentricity. Combination reamers are mostly used in screw machines or second-operation lathes, not with Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines because G-code can be easily generated to profile internal diameters.

Combination reamers can be made out of cobalt, carbide, or high speed steel tooling. When using combination reamers to ream large internal diameters made out of material with lower surface feet per minute, carbide tips can be brazed onto a configured drill blank to build the reamer. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs. It is common to use a drill bit or combination drill to remove the bulk of material to reduce wear, or the risk of the part pulling off on the combination reamer.

===Tapered reamer (non-precision)===

A tapered reamer may be used for cleaning burrs from a drilled hole, or to enlarge a hole. The body of the tool tapers to a point. This type of reamer consists of a body which, typically, is up to 1/2 inch in diameter, with a rod cross piece at the large end acting to form a handle. It is especially useful for working softer metals such as aluminum, copper, and mild steel. Another name for it is &quot;maintenance reamer&quot;, referring to its use in the miscellaneous deburring and enlarging tasks often found in MRO work. A similar tool can be seen on select Swiss Army knives, such as the electrician model, to be used on conduit.

==Process==
To achieve highly accurate and consistent diameters with a reamer, one must consider process variables that can influence the overall quality of the hole being reamed. Variables such as reamer material, reamer design, material being reamed, temperature at the reamed surface, reamer speed, machine or operator movement, etc. must be addressed. By controlling these variables to the best extent possible, the reaming process can easily produce highly accurate and consistently sized holes.

Reamers should not be reversed in use as this will tend to dull the cutting edges.

===Size – accuracy and repeatability===
The final hole size that is achieved by a reamer subsequently depends on the reaming process being used in conjunction with the reamer design and materials involved. Studies have been conducted which demonstrate the effect of coolant use during reaming. The continuous use of a coolant stream during the reaming process has been shown to consistently (75% of the time) result in hole sizes that are 0.0001 in. (0.0025 mm) larger than the reamer itself, with a process spread of +/- 0.0002 in. the remainder of the time. Similarly, using a semi-wet reaming process often results in hole sizes that are 0.0004 in. larger than the reamer itself, approximately 60% of the time, with a process spread of 0.0006 in. favoring an increase in size. Dry reaming should be discouraged due to its low level of repeatability (20%) in size and wide process spread of sizes up to 0.0012 in. (0.030 mm) larger than the reamer size.

===Surface finish and longevity===
When properly designed and used, reamers can experience an extended service life of up to 30,000 holes. A properly controlled process is also capable of maintaining a consistent size down the entire length of the hole while minimizing the hour-glass effect. Reamed holes may typically have a surface finish of Ra.

===Setup and equipment===
Generally, reaming is done using a drill press. However, lathes, machining centers and similar machines can be used as well. The workpiece is firmly held in place by either a vise, chuck or fixture while the reamer advances.

===Tool materials===
Like other cutting tools, there are two categories of materials used to build reamers: heat treated and hard. Heat treated materials are composed by different steels, most notably plain carbon (unalloyed, considered obsolete today) and high-speed steels. The most common hard material is tungsten carbide (solid or tipped), but reamers with edges of cubic boron nitride (CBN) or diamond also exist.

The main difference between both categories is that hard materials are usually unaffected by the heat produced by the machining process and may actually benefit from it. The down side is that they are usually very brittle, requiring slightly blunt cutting edges to avoid fracture. This increases the forces involved in machining and for this reason hard materials are usually not recommended for light machinery. Heat treated materials, on the other side, are usually much tougher and have no problem holding a sharp edge without chipping under less favourable conditions (like under vibration). This makes them adequate for hand tools and light machines.

===Workpiece materials===
Aluminum and brass are typical workpieces with good to excellent machinability ratings. Cast iron, mild steel and plastic have good ratings. Stainless steel has a poor rating because of its toughness and it tends to work harden as it is machined.

===Lubrication===
During the process of reaming friction causes the part and the tool to heat up. Proper lubrication cools the tool, which increases the life of the tool. Another benefit of lubrication includes higher cutting speeds. This decreases production times. Lubrication also removes chips and contributes to a better workpiece finish. Mineral oils, synthetic oils, and water-soluble oils are used for lubrication and applied by flooding or spraying. In the case of some materials only cold air is needed to cool the workpiece. This is applied by air jet or vortex tube.

==Related standards==
National and international standards are used to standardize the definitions and classifications used for reamers (either based on construction or based on method of holding or driving). Selection of the standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has some significance in the design of the reamer. In the United States, ASME has developed the B94.2 Standard, which establishes requirements methods for specifying the classification of reamers.

The lunar surface around Thales has a ray system that extends for over 600 kilometers, and it is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.
. An area to the north-northwest of the crater is free of rays, however, indicating that the crater may have been formed by a low-angle impact from that direction. The inner wall has some s, particularly along the southern side. The sides have a higher albedo than the typical lunar terrain.

This crater has been noted for transient lunar phenomena. In 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a pale haze fill the crater interior, while the surroundings remained clear and sharply visible.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Thales.

<doc id="1000143" wikidata="Q7988797" url="?curid=1000143" title="Westford Knight">
<text>&quot;Westford Knight&quot; is the name given to a pattern, variously interpreted as a carving, a natural feature, or a combination of both, located on a glacial boulder (also known as the Sinclair Rock) in Westford, Massachusetts in the United States.

It is the subject of popular or pseudohistorical speculation on Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. The pattern was first described as a possible Native American carving in 1873. The identification as a &quot;medieval knight&quot; dates to 1954.

==Early references==
The rock and carving are first mentioned in print in an 1873 edition of the &quot;Gazetteer of Massachusetts&quot; and was described as &quot;There upon its face a rude figure, supposed to have been cut by some Indian Artist.&quot; In an 1883 town history, the carving is described as &quot;A broad ledge which crops out near the house of William Kitteredge has upon its surface grooves made by glaciers. Rude outlines of the human face have been traced upon it, and the figure is said to be the work of Indians.&quot; The carving was subsequently interpreted not as a human figure but as a broken Norse Sword by William Goodwin in his book on the America&#x27;s Stonehenge site.

Frank Glynn, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, re-located the carving and following discussions with T. C. Lethbridge about Goodwin&#x27;s theory, chalked in a full figure in 1954, resembling a medieval knight, with a sword and shield, and he is usually said to be the &quot;discoverer of the Westford Knight.&quot; It was Lethbridge who suggested to Glynn that the sword was not of Viking origin, but was &quot;a hand-and-a-half wheel pommel sword&quot; common in 14th century North Britain.

==Contemporary interpretations==

Archaeologist Ken Feder has compared weathering on the stone with weathering on New England gravestones whose inscriptions have become indecipherable in the last twenty years, while &quot;the Westford petroglyph, rather miraculously, appears to have improved through time, getting fresher every year with new elements appearing that previously had gone unnoticed. In truth, this simply isn’t possible. The new imagery on the Westford Knight stone either has been recently added or is entirely imaginary, and probably a bit of both.&quot; He argues that the Indian petroglyph described in the 19th century probably existed as did the parallel glacial striations, and that later a metal row or awl was used to punch the partial shape of a sword into the rock, and that &quot;The knight in all his regalia resides only in the imagination of Frank Glynn. Other images—for example, a boat, which I could not discern on my visits—may have been added later.&quot;

The current interpretation by those who advocate that the feature on the rock is a human figure is that it commemorates a fallen member of the party of Henry Sinclair, a Scottish Earl from Orkney, whom some believe to have made a voyage to the New World in 1398, traveling to Nova Scotia and New England. According to Raymond Ramsey in 1972, the shield carried by the knight in the image was found to support this belief, when &quot;English heraldic experts consulted by Lethbridge definitely identified arms on the shield as belonging to the Sinclairs of Scotland&quot;. It has been suggested that the knight is Sir James Gunn, a member of Clan Gunn and a Knight Templar who reportedly traveled with Sinclair. The monument next to the &quot;knight&quot; commemorates this interpretation, stating as fact that Sinclair and his party traveled to present-day Massachusetts. The claim was mentioned in an &quot;Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology&quot; in 2010.

<text>Timaeus is a lunar impact crater in the northern part of the Moon, on the north edge of Mare Frigoris. It forms part of the southwestern wall of the large and irregular walled plain W. Bond. The rim of Timaeus is somewhat pentagonal in shape, with rounded corners. There is a central rise in the midpoint of the crater floor.

The irregular terrain to the west of Timaeus displays a degree of streaky parallelism, as was noted by the Rev. T. W. Webb. These follow a path slightly to the east of north.

Timaeus is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

<doc id="1000149" wikidata="Q3772017" url="?curid=1000149" title="The Sneetches and Other Stories">
<text>The Sneetches and Other Stories is a collection of stories by American children&#x27;s author Dr. Seuss, published in 1961. It is composed of four separate stories with themes of tolerance, diversity, and compromise: &quot;The Sneetches&quot;, &quot;The Zax&quot;, &quot;Too Many Daves&quot;, and &quot;What Was I Scared Of?&quot;. Based on an online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among the Top 100 Picture Books in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot; – the fifth of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.

The first two stories in the book (&quot;The Sneetches&quot; and &quot;The Zax&quot;) were later adapted, along with &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;, into 1973&#x27;s animated TV musical special &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose: The Sneetches, The Zax, Green Eggs and Ham&quot; with Hans Conried voicing the narrator and both Zax, and Paul Winchell and Bob Holt voicing the Sneetches and Sylvester McMonkey McBean respectively.

A 45-minute CGI animated special based on &quot;The Sneetches&quot; is in development for Netflix.

==Stories==
===The Sneetches===
The first story in the collection tells of a group of yellow bird-like creatures called the Sneetches, some of whom have a green star on their bellies. At the beginning of the story, Sneetches with stars discriminate against and shun those without. An entrepreneur/con-artist named Sylvester McMonkey McBean (calling himself the Fix-It-Up Chappie) appears and offers the Sneetches without stars the chance to get them with his Star-On machine, for three dollars. The treatment is instantly popular, but this upsets the original Star-Bellied Sneetches, as they are in danger of losing their special status. McBean then tells them about his Star-Off machine, costing ten dollars, and the Sneetches who originally had stars happily pay the money to have them removed in order to remain special. However, McBean does not share the prejudices of the Sneetches and allows the recently starred Sneetches through this machine as well. Ultimately, this escalates, with the Sneetches running from one machine to the next...
: &quot;...until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew
: whether this one was that one... or that one was this one...
: or which one was what one... or what one was who&quot;.
This continues until the Sneetches are penniless and McBean departs as a rich man, amused by their folly. Despite his assertion that &quot;you can&#x27;t teach a Sneetch&quot;, the Sneetches learn from this experience that neither Plain-Bellied nor Star-Bellied Sneetches are superior, and they are able to get along and become friends. &quot;The Sneetches&quot; was intended by Seuss as a satire of discrimination between races and cultures, and was specifically inspired by his opposition to antisemitism.

===The Zax===

In &quot;The Zax&quot;, a North-going Zax and a South-going Zax meet face to face on the Prairie of Prax. Each asks the other to make way, but neither budges, saying it is against their upbringing to move any other way. Because they stubbornly refuse to move (east, west, or any direction except their respective headings) to get past each other, the two Zax then face off against each other with their arms crossed. The Zax stand so long that eventually a highway overpass is built around them. The story ends with the Zax still standing there &quot;unbudged&quot; in their tracks.

===Too Many Daves===
&quot;Too Many Daves&quot; is a very short story about a mother, Mrs. McCave, who named all 23 of her sons Dave. This causes minor problems in the family when she calls one of them, but instead, they all come, and the rest of the story lists unusual and amusing names she wishes she had given them, such as &quot;Bodkin Van Horn&quot;, &quot;Hoos Foos&quot;, &quot;Snimm&quot;, &quot;Hot-Shot&quot;, &quot;Shadrack&quot;, &quot;Stuffy&quot;, &quot;Stinky&quot;, &quot;Putt-Putt&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;, &quot;Oliver Boliver Butt&quot;, &quot;Biffalo Buff&quot; or &quot;Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate&quot;. The story ends with the statement that &quot;she didn&#x27;t do it, and now it&#x27;s too late&quot;.

===What Was I Scared Of?===
&quot;What Was I Scared Of?&quot; tells the tale of a character who frequently encounters an empty pair of pale-green pants in dark and spooky locations. The character, who is the narrator, is initially afraid of the pants, which are able to stand freely despite the lack of a wearer. However, when he screams for help, the pants also start to cry, and he realizes that &quot;they were just as scared as I!&quot; The empty pants and the narrator become friends. This is one of the few Seuss works in verse that is not Anapestic tetrameter.

== Distribution by NATO in Bosnia ==

In 1998, NATO translated the collection into Serbo-Croatian and planned to distribute 500,000 copies to children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of a campaign to encourage tolerance. This was later scaled back to 50,000 copies at a cost of $120,000 as well as looking for a more appropriate source of funding such as an NGO, private charity or corporation, as this expenditure did not meet the &quot;Minimum Military Requirement&quot; test for NATO common funding eligibility.

<text>Torricelli is a lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Sinus Asperitatis, to the south of the Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli. The western rim of the crater is broken open and joined to a smaller crater to the west. The entire formation has a pear-shaped appearance. Torricelli lies in the northeastern part of a circular formation of rises in the lunar mare, possibly the remains of a crater formation buried by lava.

<doc id="1000153" wikidata="Q5050339" url="?curid=1000153" title="Castle Walk">
<text>Castle Walk is a dance originated and made famous by Vernon and Irene Castle. The moniker was coined from the Castle&#x27;s signature dance step styling, and their touring stage show of 1913 lead with this as their signature. The Castle Walk became popular through its introduction into the Tango. &quot;Castle Walk&quot; is also a popular American song composed for Vernon and Irene Castle by James Reese Europe (1880–1919) and Ford Thompson Dabney (1883–1958). It was first recorded in 1914, commissioned by the Castles to accompany and provide music for their social dancing programs, having been one of these resulting pieces. Though many dance accompaniments of the time are syncopated rhythms, Castle Walk in particular carries syncopation in half-measure.

== The dance ==
In this dance, the man (the leader) continually goes forward and the lady (the follower) backward. In order that the lady may be properly guided about the room, the man&#x27;s arm encircles her right under her arm, while her left hand rests on the man&#x27;s right arm. The position of the lady&#x27;s right arm and the man&#x27;s left arm is high, with their hands clasped, as portrayed in the illustration.

The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, walking with gliding steps, keeping on the toes to one count of the music with each step. This is continued to the end of the room, where a large circle is begun, which is gradually made smaller and smaller, until it is ended by whirling completely around three times to corresponding counts of the music, ending with a dip. The three whirls must be done rapidly to accomplish a complete revolution to one beat of the music.

The Castle Walk may be varied by describing the figure eight or zig-zag instead of the large circle in the steps taken.

Troy Kinney describes the Castle Walk as part of One-Step as follows: 
This is a walking step of direct advance and retreat, not used to move to the side. The couple are in closed position, the woman, therefore, stepping backward as the man steps forward, and vice versa. The advancing foot is planted in fourth position, the knee straight, the toe down so that the ball of the foot strikes the floor first. The walk presents an appearance of strutting, although the shoulders are held level, and the body firm; a sharp twist that punctuates each step is effected by means of pivoting on the supporting foot. The shoulder and hip movements that originally characterized the &quot;trot&quot; are no longer practiced in the dance.

<text>A boardwalk (alternatively board walk, boarded path, or [[promenade]]) is an elevated footpath, walkway, or causeway typically built with wooden planks, which functions as a type of low water bridge or small viaduct that enables pedestrians to better cross wet, muddy or marshy lands. Such timber trackways have existed since at least Neolithic times.

In many seaside resort locations, boardwalks along the beach provide access to shops, hotels, and tourist attractions. The Jersey Shore in the United States is especially noted for its abundance of boardwalks.

Some wooden boardwalks have had sections replaced by concrete and even &quot;a type of recycled plastic that looks like wood.&quot;

==History==

An early example is the Sweet Track that Neolithic people built in the Somerset levels, England, around 6000 years ago. This track consisted mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, driven into the underlying peat.

The Wittmoor bog trackway is the name given to each of two prehistoric plank roads, or boardwalks, trackway No. I being discovered in 1898 and trackway No. II in 1904 in the &quot;Wittmoor&quot; bog in northern Hamburg, Germany. The trackways date to the 4th and 7th century AD, both linked the eastern and western shores of the formerly inaccessible, swampy bog. A part of the older trackway No. II dating to the period of the Roman Empire is on display at the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg borough, Hamburg.

==Duckboards==

A duckboard is a type of boardwalk placed over muddy and wet ground. During World War I, duckboards were used to line the bottom of trenches on the Western Front because these were regularly flooded, and mud and water would lie in the trenches for months on end. The boards helped to keep the soldiers&#x27; feet dry and prevent the development of trench foot, caused by prolonged standing in waterlogged conditions. They also allowed for troops&#x27; easier movement through the trench systems. 

Combat troops on nearly all sides routinely wore hobnail-style trench boots that often slipped on the new duck boards when they were wet, and required extra caution. Falling or slipping off the duckboards could often be dangerous, even fatal. Unfortunate soldiers were left struggling to rise under the weight of their equipment in the intractable and sometimes deep water or mud. If this happened at ground level during a tactical advance, the rising soldier could be left a defenseless target for enemy fire as well as hinder forward progress. He could also simply go unnoticed in the ensuing melee, and easily drown under his heavy equipment.

<text>Tsiolkovskiy is a large lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. Named for Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, it lies in the southern hemisphere, to the west of the large crater Gagarin, and northwest of Milne. Just to the south is Waterman, with Neujmin to the south-southwest. The crater protrudes into the neighbouring Fermi, an older crater of comparable size that does not have a lava-flooded floor.

Tsiolkovskiy has been considered one of the largest craters of the Upper (Late) Imbrian age, although that dating was revised to the Imbrian/Eratosthenian boundary in 2013. A number of sites on its walls and central peak have slopes over 45°, leading some to propose a Late Eratosthenian dating.

==Characteristics==
Tsiolkovskiy is one of the most prominent features on the far side of the Moon. It possesses high, d inner walls and a well-formed central peak, which rises over 3200 m above the floor of the crater. The floor is unusual for a crater on the far side, as it is covered by the dark-hued mare that is characteristic of the maria found on the near side. The distribution of the mare material is not symmetrical across the floor, but is instead more heavily concentrated to the east and south. There is also a protruding bay of darker material that reaches the wall to the west-northwest. The remainder of the floor has the same albedo as the terrain surrounding the crater.

The crater has an unusually high rockfall density for its diameter, although this does not apply to its northwest rim.

A row of small craters in Mendeleev crater far to the northeast is called Catena Mendeleev, and the row points directly at Tsiolkovsky. For this reason the craters are believed to be secondaries from the Tsiolkovsky impact.

This feature was discovered on photographs sent back by the Russian spacecraft Luna 3, and was subsequently imaged by several of the American Lunar Orbiters and then by Apollo astronauts.

Apollo 17 Astronaut Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Schmitt and other scientists (Schmitt was the only trained scientist, a geologist, to walk on the Moon) strongly advocated Tsiolkovskiy as the landing site of Apollo 17, using small communications satellites deployed from the Command/Service Module for communication from the far side of the Moon. NASA vetoed the idea as too risky, and Apollo 17 instead landed in the Taurus–Littrow valley on December 11, 1972.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tsiolkovskiy.

<text>A rock formation is an isolated, scenic, or spectacular surface rock outcrop. Rock formations are usually the result of weathering and erosion sculpting the existing rock. The term &quot;rock formation&quot; can also refer to specific sedimentary strata or other rock unit in stratigraphic and petrologic studies.

A rock structure can be created in any rock type or combination:
* Igneous rocks are created when molten rock cools and solidifies, with or without crystallisation. They may be either plutonic bodies or volcanic extrusive. Again, erosive forces sculpt their current forms.
* Metamorphic rocks are created by rocks that have been transformed into another kind of rock, usually by some combination of heat, pressure, and chemical alteration.
* Sedimentary rocks are created by a variety of processes but usually involving deposition, grain by grain, layer by layer, in water or, in the case of terrestrial sediments, on land through the action of wind or sometimes moving ice. Erosion later exposes them in their current form.

Geologists have created a number of terms to describe different rock structures in the landscape that can be formed by natural processes:

* Butte
* Cliff
* Cut bank
* Escarpment
* Gorge
* Inselberg, or monadnock
* Mesa
* Peak
* Promontory
* River cliff
* Sea cliff
* Stack
* Stone run
* Tor

<doc id="1000168" wikidata="Q7962441" url="?curid=1000168" title="Walking Boston">
<text>The Walking Boston, sometimes designated the One Step [[Waltz]], is a very simple dance in which many graceful figures may be introduced. It is done to the same music as the Hesitation Waltz and Dream Waltz.

The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, simply walking to waltz time, counting one, two, three to each step. At each step the dancers rise on their toes. Four of these steps are taken forward (backward by the lady), then they balance backward and forward. As the dancers balance they make a quarter turn to the man&#x27;s right to the one, two, three count of the music--four of these quarter turns making the complete revolution. Throughout this turn the man keeps his right foot and the lady her left on the floor, using it as a pivot on which to turn.

Now the man steps backward with his left foot and the lady forward with her right, taking four steps. Then balance, and instead of four quarter turns to the one, two, three count of the music, make two half turns in the same time.

The dance includes a great deal of &quot;balancing&quot;. Indeed, the Walking Boston cannot be performed easily or gracefully unless the balancing is done properly. Balancing means throwing the weight of the body successively on to one foot and then on the other. This is done with one foot well in advance of the other. Good dancers get plenty of swing into their action. Swing forward. Swing backward. In balancing on to the forward foot, the backward foot should barely leave the floor, and in no event should it be brought forward. And in balancing onto the backward foot the forward foot should not be brought backward.

The above are the fundamental figures of the Walking Boston. There is no rule governing the number of steps to be taken forward or back, the number of times to balance, or the number of turns to be made. This is left entirely to the pleasure of the dancers. The number four mentioned in the preceding was merely illustrative.

The fundamental figures may be varied by skipping, the man on his left foot, the lady on her right. This skipping step is made by the man on his left foot only, and by the lady on her right only, thus making every other step a skipping step.

Another figure may be introduced by the couple taking a position both facing forward.

Four steps are taken forward, dipping on the fourth step (see Illustration 11), then back four steps and turn.

Couple starts forward, the man with his left foot and the lady with her right, taking three steps, making a little skip as the third step is taken; this skip is on the man&#x27;s right foot and the lady&#x27;s left; they balance twice, then repeat.

The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady with her right, taking five steps forward, skipping on each step. Balance twice, then turn the body around without changing the position of the arms and take four steps in the opposite direction, skipping on each step as before; then turn as described previously.

It is common for dancers to do the turn after each of the figures, but the order of the figures is optional with the dancers.

#Both starting with the left foot, take four steps forward; on the fifth step, change position, the man crossing over behind the lady without releasing the hands or losing a step; three more steps forward and then cross back again; then three more steps forward. In other words, this is merely twelve steps forward, changes of position being made on the fifth and ninth steps. Completion of these twelve steps leaves the dancers in the same position as at the start.
#Now, without losing a step or getting out of time with the music, both dancers one step straight to the side with the left foot, then backward with the right foot and dip. Again sideways with the left foot and backward with the right and dip, and so on for ten or twelve steps, keeping on a straight line to the left.
#Repeat # 1.
#Grapevine, dipping on the backward step.

<doc id="1000175" wikidata="Q3394686" url="?curid=1000175" title="Computer security policy">
<text>A computer security policy defines the goals and elements of an organization&#x27;s computer systems. The definition can be highly formal or informal. Security policies are enforced by organizational policies or security mechanisms. A technical implementation defines whether a computer system is &quot;secure&quot; or &quot;insecure&quot;. These formal policy models can be categorized into the core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, the Bell–LaPadula model is a &quot;confidentiality policy model&quot;, whereas the Biba model is an &quot;integrity policy model&quot;.

== Formal description ==
If a system is regarded as a finite-state automaton with a set of transitions (operations) that change the system&#x27;s state, then a &quot;security policy&quot; can be seen as a statement that partitions these states into authorized and unauthorized ones.

Given this simple definition, one can define a &quot;secure system&quot; as one that starts in an authorized state and will never enter an unauthorized state.

== Formal policy models ==

=== Confidentiality policy model===
* Bell-La Padula model

=== Integrity policies model===
* Biba model
* Clark-Wilson model

=== Hybrid policy model===
* Chinese wall (Also known as Brewer and Nash model)

== Policy languages ==
To represent a concrete policy, especially for automated enforcement of it, a language representation is needed. There exist a lot of application-specific languages that are closely coupled with the security mechanisms that enforce the policy in that application.

Compared with this abstract policy languages, e.g., the Domain Type Enforcement-Language, is independent of the concrete mechanism.

<text>Melissha Martinez (born 21 December 1978), better known by her stage name Maya Jupiter, is a Mexican-born Australian rapper, singer, songwriter, actress, MC and radio personality. She released her debut album, &quot;Today&quot;, in 2003. She was a member of hip-hop group, Foreign Heights, with MC Trey and DJ Nick Toth, which released a self-titled album in 2007. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 the trio was nominated for &#x27;Best Urban Release&#x27; for &quot;Get Yours (Remix)&quot;. From 2004 to 2008, Jupiter hosted the national radio station, Triple J&#x27;s weekly &quot;Hip-Hop Show&quot;. Thereafter she pursued her solo career based in Los Angeles and released her second album, &quot;Maya Jupiter&quot;, in December 2010.

==Biography==
Maya Jupiter was born as Melissha Martinez on 21 December 1978 in La Paz, Mexico. Her father is Mexican and her mother is Turkish. She has an elder sister, Shiraz Martinez. Her family moved to Melbourne, Victoria when Jupiter was one year old, then relocated to Sydney, when she was four. From four to twelve years old, she grew up in Busby, a suburb in South-western Sydney and then lived in Ashfield. Her parents provided a wide range of musical experience, &quot;At home, we always had different styles of music playing ... [m]y mum used to play classical music, traditional Turkish and pop music, but she was also into jazz and soul. My father used to listen to Spanish-language music&quot;. In primary school Jupiter was a school captain, and in secondary school she became a prefect and a sports captain. At the age of 14, she wrote her first rhyme. Her sister took her to local salsa and Latin American clubs. In public Jupiter mostly used English and did not speak much Spanish until she was 17, later she reflected, &quot;I speak more Spanish than I do Turkish! But I was raised by my Mum, so she reminds me that I should be making more Turkish music&quot;. At the age of 18, she adopted her stage name using her mother&#x27;s advice, &quot;to reflect the Mayan side of her heritage&quot; and began performing in an R&amp;B club in Sydney.

In 1998, Jupiter was introduced to the Australian hip hop scene at the Urban Xpressions Festival. One of her early inspirations was Trey, &quot;That was the direction I wanted to go in, and it was nice to have a female role model&quot;. From 2001 she started recording tracks &quot;in a piecemeal fashion&quot;. She had a minor role in the feature film, &quot;Lantana&quot;, as a dance instructor. In August 2003 Jupiter released her first album, &quot;Today&quot;, on Mother Tongues – the first label in the world dedicated to developing women in Hip-Hop music. &quot;Mamacita&quot; was a track dedicated to her mother, &quot;[it] was about the divorce of my parents and I guess it was very personal ... very full on. ... I needed to get out about my father because I didn&#x27;t see him for about seven years, which I think incited the whole fascination of wanting to know about the Mexican culture&quot;. Also that year, she worked with eleven-piece Latin, jazz, hip-hop band, Son Veneno, and accompanied them to The Belligen Global Music Festival. The combination have since performed at numerous festivals including Homebake, Bacardi Festival and supported American singer, Kelis.

By August 2003, Jupiter was also a regular host for shows such as &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Freestyle&quot; on television video outlet, Channel V, and held hip-hop / rap workshops in community centres. She took over as host of national radio station Triple J&#x27;s weekly music program, &quot;Hip Hop Show&quot;, in 2004. In 2006, Jupiter joined with fellow rap artist MC Trey and DJ Nick Toth to form the group, Foreign Heights. They released their first single, &quot;It Goes On&quot;, featuring Mr Zux in November of that year. In January 2007 their self-titled album was released in Australia and they performed at the Big Day Out. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 Foreign Heights was nominated for &#x27;Best Urban Release&#x27; for &quot;Get Yours (Remix)&quot;.

On 14 April 2008, Hau, frontman of Koolism, took over Jupiter&#x27;s role as host of the &quot;Hip Hop Show&quot;, and she left Australia to further her solo career in Los Angeles.

In December 2010, Jupiter released her second album, &quot;Maya Jupiter&quot; with Blacc assisting on recording and Quetzal Flores and Martha Gonzalez (both are members of Quetzal) co-producing. &quot;OC Weekly&quot;″s reviewer, Gabriel San Roman described the album as &quot;an innovative collection of songs anchored in lyrical themes of social justice and &quot;Son Jarocho&quot; vibes&quot; and was pleased by &quot;[t]he sample-free, original instrumentation [which] adds to her music&#x27;s unique appeal. A Latin American harp, requintos, jaranas, electric guitars, trumpets and keys round out her melodies, and there&#x27;s a striking use of live percussion instruments such as the quijada, cajón, tarima and pandiero instead of MPC drum beats&quot;.

Jupiter is married to Panamanian-American singer Aloe Blacc. In September 2013, they had their first child, a girl named Mandela. In January 2016, they had their second child, a son.

<doc id="1000181" wikidata="Q1740385" url="?curid=1000181" title="Vehicle registration plates of Australia">
<text>Australian vehicle registration plates, or number plates, and license plates are issued by state, territory, and Commonwealth governments, and the armed forces of Australia. The plates are associated with a vehicle and are generally intended to last during the time that the vehicle remains registered in the state, though as they become unreadable (or for other reasons) they may be remade with a like for like replacement. Motor vehicle registration in Australia can be renewed monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually depending on the state or territory where the vehicle is registered.

== Current standard issue plates ==

=== Standard issue ===

=== Motorcycles ===

On all other motorcycle plates, the legend is embossed on top of the state or territory.

== History and Federal numbering scheme ==

===Standards and federal allocations for all vehicles===
From 1910 onwards, vehicle registration plates for each state started at number 1 and were manufactured in enamel.

Starting in 1936, it was decided that Australian plates were to be uniform in size and embossed using standard Australian dies, beginning with New South Wales, the Federal Capital Territory (now Australian Capital Territory) and Victoria. By 1956, the other states and territories had moved to standard Australian embossing using painted or enamelled metal, with dimensions of × . The embossed Australian dies was standardised in all states and territories in 1954.

In the early 1950s, a uniform scheme for vehicle registration plates was developed, which was to apply across all states and territories. Previously, both New South Wales and Victoria had issued plates with two letters and three digits, in white on a black background. However, that was not entirely popular, and some states and territories preferred to have their own identity reflected on their registration plates.

The following scheme was meant to be implemented Australia-wide after 1952:

Western Australia deemed itself too large to fit into the proposed scheme and devised its own. Plates in the Iaa-nnn series were to be skipped, because as a capital I was believed to be easily mistaken for the number 1. That allowed the two populous states, with a greater number of registered vehicles, to be allocated a series of six letters series: New South Wales had A to F, Victoria had G to H, and J to M. Three other states had a series of three letters: Queensland had N, P and Q, South Australia had R to T, Western Australia had U and V. Due to its small size, Tasmania was only given one letter, W, the Australian Capital Territory was given Y and the Northern Territory was given the letter X. The letter Z was for Commonwealth government departmental use Australia-wide, the second letter reflecting the department. The letters I and O were deemed to be too similar to 1 and 0 and weren&#x27;t part of the original scheme.

The system, introduced in 1951–52, was not as popular as expected. The Northern Territory declined to participate and continued its previous all-number system. Western Australia did adopt the scheme, taking XAA-000 to XZZ-999, previously allocated to the NT. WAG-000 to WAG-999 was reserved for WA Government vehicles, later extended to XZZ-999. However, many WA rural shires chose to issue their own plates, in the WA colour scheme, with the initial letters being the shire abbreviations, followed by digits.

All the other states and territories stuck to their initial allocations, until the number of registrations became too large for each state&#x27;s allocation, so state authorities allowed their registration numbers to &quot;overflow&quot; into series allocated to another state. In 1972, NSW extended its numbering from FZZ-999 to GAA-000, which had been originally issued to Victoria. In 1974, Victoria, having reserved the Maa-nnn series for state government vehicle registrations, extended its numbering from LZZ-999 to IAA-000, with the letter I no longer being avoided. In 1977, it began using IZZ-999 to AAA-000, the latter originally allocated to NSW. South Australia did similar, extending from SZZ-999 to UAA-000, having reserved the Taa-nnn series for trailer registrations.

All states and territories have now adopted their own series, given that the grouped allocations from the 1950s have long since run out. Various combinations of letters and numbers are now used in each state.

===Federal Interstate Registration Scheme===
Run years: 1 January 1987 to 1 July 2018.

Heavy vehicles (over 4.5 tonnes GVM), can choose to participate in FIRS scheme.

FIRS plates are WX·00AA, and are green on a reflective yellow background.

FIRS plates are issued by state authorities on behalf of the Commonwealth, and carry the format as specified by the &quot;Interstate Road Transport Regulations 1986 – Reg 21&quot;. Federal Interstate-registered vehicles are prohibited from undertaking intrastate journeys and can only be used for cross-border work.

The first character represents the state of issue:
* A for Australian Capital Territory
* J for Jervis Bay Territory
* N for New South Wales
* C for Northern Territory
* Q for Queensland
* S for South Australia
* T for Tasmania
* V for Victoria
* W for Western Australia

The second character represents the type of vehicle being registered:
* V for vehicle (typically issued to prime-movers, but are also attached to rigid vehicles such as coaches and moving trucks).
* T for trailer.
* X for extra weight, for vehicles with particular high gross vehicle or aggregate trailer masses.

The remaining characters are allocated by the issuing authorities. As most interstate transport companies are based on the East Coast, the majority of FIRS plates are registered in NSW and VIC. Some issues originate in QLD or SA, with the remaining states appearing relatively rarely.

A typical plate which might be found on a semi-trailer, registered to a company in QLD would be QT·88MW.

 ALL FIRS scheme plates ceased accepting renewals on 1 July 2018 and FIRS closed on 1 July 2019, after all FIRS registration expired and plates exchanged to the new National Heavy Vehicle scheme/state based registration plates.

More details are found under the Infrastructure website of the Federal Government&#x27;s

===National Heavy Vehicle Registration Scheme===

Starting on 1 July 2018, a new system was implemented in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. Victoria joined the scheme on 1 October 2018.

Northern Territory started using National Heavy Vehicle Plates and abolished the rego stickers effective on 1 August 2019.

Western Australia is not participating, hence WA Heavy Vehicles are on state based plates.

The format now in use are:

FB-12AA in Black on white reflection base, and blue band legend with the words NATIONAL HEAVY VEHICLE imprinted on it.

XQ-12AA is for Trucks while YQ-12AA is for Trailers. In this example the prefix denotes X for Trucks and Y for Trailers and the last prefix letter is for home states/territory:
* A for Australian Capital Territory
* J for Jervis Bay Territory
* N, O and P for New South Wales
* R for Northern Territory
* Q and B for Queensland
* S for South Australia
* T for Tasmania
* V, W and X for Victoria

It replaced the state based general series, however not mandatory and owners can request state based personalised plates if they wish to have them. It applies to new heavy vehicles or heavy vehicle requiring replacement of state based general series plates. 4.5 GVM minimum must qualify for the new plates.

===Debate about registration on bicycle riders===
For many years in Australia they have had a debate about should registration be also on bicycle riders.

In 2014, Randwick councillor Charles Matthews proposed to impose a $50 registration fee on bicycle riders, which would be used to help fund cycleways being built by the council. This proposal was rejected by other councillors. In 2014, the Victorian council of City of Bayside tried a same proposal.

== Common features ==

Plates tend to bear the State or Territory name and perhaps a state motto or slogan at the top and/or bottom of the plate. Recent issues of plates (since the 1980s) also often use the state&#x27;s colours and may include some imagery related to the state (such as the state&#x27;s logo as the sequence separator).

=== Alternative fuel vehicle identification ===

Under Part 10 of the Australian Light Vehicle Standards Rules 2015, vehicles powered by fuels other than petrol or diesel (collectively alternative fuel systems) must always display a specific plate that is affixed to both the front and rear number plates. These labels exist to assist emergency services personnel in responding to potential hazards involving such vehicles. Generally, such labels are applied permanently to the registration plate by way of pop rivets or other mechanical fixtures.

The standards were updated in March 2019, to add standards for hydrogen and electric powered vehicles.

LPG, LNG or CNG vehicles with more than one tank of that type are required to have one additional diamond attached to the front and back number plates.

==== Labelling for pre 1 January 2019 hydrogen or electric vehicles ====

Hydrogen or electric powered vehicles built or converted before 1 January 2019 are still subject to relevant state-based standards for their labelling. For example in Victoria, all electric-powered vehicles (including hybrid vehicles) need to display &quot;EV&quot; number plate labels on both number plates. Electric-powered passenger cars and hybrid vehicles registered before 4 October 2020 were required to display a different style of label.

== Commonwealth and military ==



Military plates were nnn-nnn with the first digit corresponding to the military district number:
* 1 – Australian Capital Territory
* 2 – New South Wales
* 3 – Victoria
* 4 – Queensland
* 5 – South Australia
* 6 – Western Australia
* 7 – Tasmania
* 8 – Northern Territory

However, new plates issued to the Army are now in this format: nn-nnnn, where the first two digits represent the year the vehicle was registered, e.g. 05-1832.

Current Australian Army registration plate format is A&quot;nn&quot;nnn with this newer format beginning in 2003. The A represents &quot;Army&quot; with the next two digits representing the year the vehicle was first registered. For instance, a 2008 model Toyota Coaster used to transport army cadets might have the plate A08227. This format has also been adopted by the Defence Force, Navy, and Air Force with combinations D&quot;nn&quot;nnn, N&quot;nn&quot;nnn and R&quot;nn&quot;nnn respectively.

The official car of Chief of the Defence Force carries plates ADF1 and official cars for the three service chiefs carry plates ARMY1, NAVY1 or RAAF1.

The Commonwealth Government of Australia used the Z prefix for its government owned vehicles up until 2000 when the Commonwealth Vehicle Registry was closed.

These plates were on a black on white background, usually marked with &quot;C of A&quot; at the top of the plate – an abbreviation of Commonwealth of Australia and the leading Z being red to further distinguish it from other state plates.

Issuance of Z prefixed plates used for same purposes was passed onto the states after 2000. Australian Capital Territory plates started at ZYA-000, Victoria plates started at ZED-000, Queensland plates started at ZQ-0000, New South Wales plates started at ZZZ-000, South Australia plates started at ZSA-000, Western Australia plates started at ZAA-00F and Tasmania plates started at ZTA-000. Only New South Wales and Victoria chose to use their state base colours rather than the standard black on reflective white, with the use of red embossed Z prefix.

Each of the states display their state initials as seen above the numbers instead of the old &quot;C of A&quot; legend.

The Northern Territory still uses the older format and same &quot;C of A&quot; legend at top of the plate.

The registration plate of the Prime Ministerial Limousine was C*1 (i.e. Commonwealth No. 1) with a seven-pointed Commonwealth Star. This was updated on 11 November 2015, showing C (Australian Government crest image) 1. Other Commonwealth fleet cars for official transport carry &quot;C of A&quot; plates in the form C-nnn.

The Governor-General&#x27;s official cars do not carry registration plates, but simply depict a representation of the St Edward&#x27;s Crown. They tend to also have a flag mounted on the official car. Similar plates were used for vehicles carrying Queen Elizabeth II when visiting Australia.

Cars owned by the government have special number plates, some also have a crown and symbols.

For official visits to Australia, special plates are often put over the top of normal &quot;Z&quot; plates, depicting the Australian Coat of Arms and, in red &quot;Visit to Australia&quot; with a numeral. These are not strictly registration plates, but are useful for police and other officials to identify cars in official motorcades.
== Diplomatic ==
Diplomatic plates are issued to foreign diplomats by the Government of the Australian Capital Territory. They would formerly grant diplomatic immunity to the vehicle and driver from all traffic laws, speed limits, parking infringements and tolls in all reasonable course of duty by a diplomatic officer, in compliance with international treaty, but this is no longer the case. They follow the format of &quot;DC nnnn&quot;, &quot;DCnnnnn&quot;, &quot;DX nnnn&quot; or &quot;DXnnnnn&quot;, where the first two or three numbers are the code for the home country of the diplomat, and have black text on a powder blue background. DC plates are issued to members of the diplomatic corps, whereas DX plates are issued to persons who are attached to diplomatic missions but are not themselves diplomats, e.g. household staff.

Older issues have no territory identifier, however newer plates have &quot;ACT&quot; embossed at the top centre of the plate. Newer plates are also written as &quot;DC&quot; and &quot;DX&quot;, rather than &quot;D.C.&quot; and &quot;D.X.&quot; to allow for the inclusion of a greater number of characters in the sequence. A substantial number of older-style plates are still in use, however.

The first two or three numbers appearing in the plate correspond to a specific country, for example 69 is issued to the United Kingdom. The following two digits are typically issued with lower numbers to higher-ranking officials, usually 01 being issued to the ambassador from that country. So DC 6901 would be found on the vehicle of the British High Commissioner to Australia.

The number issued to each country has no particular relevance, and was allocated by ballot. Countries with many vehicles (such as the USA) are allocated two numbers. Before the blue D.C. plates were introduced, diplomatic cars in Canberra carried plates which had white letters on red.

The numbers then correlated to the length of time the particular diplomatic mission had been in Canberra and the British High Commissioner&#x27;s car carried the plate D.C.1 The replacement arrangement is more egalitarian.

State registration authorities issue CC plates to consular representatives in their relevant state capital.

The ACT Government issues similar plates to representatives of international organisations in the Territory. These plates are also coloured black on powder blue, and follow a format of IO nnnn.

== Registration labels abolition ==
All other states have abolished registration labels for light and heavy vehicles:
*Western Australia – 1 January 2010, beginning with light vehicles is the first to be abolished and in Northern Territory is the last to be abolished from 1 August 2019 for Heavy Vehicles.

<doc id="1000182" wikidata="Q2528794" url="?curid=1000182" title="Vitruvius (crater)">
<text>Vitruvius is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the northern edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis. To the east is the crater Gardner, and to the northeast is Fabbroni. To the north-northwest is the elongated Mons Vitruvius mountain, and beyond is the valley where the Apollo 17 mission landed.

The rim of Vitruvius is somewhat circular, but the sides are uneven to the north and east. The rim is highest to the northwest. The interior floor is uneven, with some low rises in the southwest. A small crater is attached to southern outer rim. The surroundings grow more rugged to the north of the crater. The crater was named after the ancient Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius.

Vitruvius is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vitruvius.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Vitruvius A — &quot;See&quot; Gardner (crater).
* Vitruvius E — &quot;See&quot; Fabbroni (crater).

Vitruvius G is named &quot;El Greco&quot; on Lunar Topographic Orthophotomap LTO-61A1 Cajal, but this name was not approved by the IAU.

<doc id="1000184" wikidata="Q4928413" url="?curid=1000184" title="Blorb">
<text>Blorb is a package format for interactive fiction games. Many such games incorporate resources such as sound effects, music, or pictures. Blorb&#x27;s purpose is to bind these together into one file. The format was devised by Andrew Plotkin and is used in both the Z-machine and Glulx virtual machines, as well as by the Glk library.

== Concept ==
In the days when games were distributed only on disk, there was no problem in associating a game with its resources: the resources were simply shipped on the same disk. Since all Z-machine games were produced by Infocom, there was also no chance that resources would be shipped in a format which a user&#x27;s interpreter program could not handle. Blorb is needed because neither of these assumptions hold true in modern times: games are typically downloaded as single files, and a user may be using any of a large number of interpreters.

A Blorb file may optionally include the executable code of the game itself. This allows authors of modern games to ship one file containing everything needed to play the game, while also allowing the creation of resource files for classic Infocom games without running the risk of copyright infringement by distributing Infocom&#x27;s Z-machine executable code.

Glulx games are almost always shipped in the Blorb format. A rather smaller proportion of Z-machine games make use of it, since Z-machine games often rely only on text, and so have no need for the extra resources. As of 2004 Blorb files are supported by all Glk interactive fiction interpreters, including Nitfol and Glulxe.

The Blorb format continues the tradition of naming interactive fiction tools after spells in Infocom&#x27;s &quot;Enchanter&quot; trilogy. &quot;Blorb&quot; was a spell to bind objects into boxes.

Blorb is an IFF format, with FORM IFRS. The MIME type commonly in use is &quot;application/x-blorb&quot;, and the filename extension is &quot;.blorb&quot;, or, for systems where filename extensions are limited to three characters, &quot;.blb&quot;. Blorb files containing Z-code games may be named with the extension &quot;.zblorb&quot; or &quot;.zlb&quot;; or, for Glulx games, &quot;.gblorb&quot; or &quot;.glb&quot;. These alternative extensions are intended to make it easier for interpreters to ascertain the type of game contained inside.

<text>Werner is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It was named after the 15th-century German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Werner. It is almost joined with the crater Aliacensis to the southeast, and the pair form a rugged valley in the intervening gap. Due west of Werner is the distorted Regiomontanus, and to the north is the remains of Blanchinus. It is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

The rim of Werner shows little appearance of wear, and is much younger and less eroded than the other large craters in the surroundings. The interior wall is d, and there is a noticeable rampart on the exterior. There are several low rises on the crater floor and a notable central peak. Its highly terraced walls attain peaks of almost 1,500 feet. The crater is 45 miles (70 kilometers) in diameter, and the difference in height between its rim and its deepest parts is 4.2 kilometers.

Near the Werner crater, a chiaroscuro effect created by the dark craters and their lit rims is visible for several hours before first quarter forms an X.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Werner.

<text>Robert Henri (; June 24, 1865 – July 12, 1929) was an American painter and teacher. 
As a young man, he studied in Paris, where he identified strongly with the Impressionists, and determined to lead an even more dramatic revolt against American academic art, as reflected by the conservative National Academy of Design. Together with a small team of enthusiastic followers, he pioneered the Ashcan School of American realism, depicting urban life in an uncompromisingly brutalist style. By the time of the Armory Show, America&#x27;s first large-scale introduction to European Modernism (1913), Henri was mindful that his own representational technique was being made to look dated by new movements such as Cubism, though he was still ready to champion avant-garde painters such as Henri Matisse and Max Weber.

In 1929 Henri was named as one of the top three living American artists by the Arts Council of New York.

== Early life ==
Robert Henri was born Robert Henry Cozad in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Theresa Gatewood Cozad and John Jackson Cozad, a gambler and real estate developer. Henri was a distant cousin of the painter Mary Cassatt. In 1871, Henri&#x27;s father founded the town of Cozaddale, Ohio. In 1873, the family moved west to Nebraska, where John J. Cozad founded the town of Cozad.

In October 1882, Henri&#x27;s father became embroiled in a dispute with a rancher, Alfred Pearson, over the right to pasture cattle on land claimed by the family. When the dispute turned physical, Cozad shot Pearson fatally with a pistol. Cozad was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but the mood of the town turned against him. He fled to Denver, Colorado, and the rest of the family followed shortly afterwards. In order to disassociate themselves from the scandal, family members changed their names. The father became known as Richard Henry Lee, and his sons posed as adopted children under the names Frank Southrn and Robert Earl Henri (pronounced &quot;hen rye&quot;). In 1883, the family moved to New York City, then to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the young artist completed his first paintings.

== Education ==
In 1886, Henri enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he studied under Thomas Anshutz, a protege of Thomas Eakins, and Thomas Hovenden, who was especially interested in anatomy. In 1888, he traveled to Paris to study at the Académie Julian, where he studied under the academic realist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, came to admire greatly the work of Francois Millet, and embraced Impressionism. &quot;His European study had helped Henri develop rather catholic tastes in art.&quot; He was admitted into the École des Beaux Arts. He visited Brittany and Italy during this period. At the end of 1891, he returned to Philadelphia, studying under Robert Vonnoh at the Pennsylvania Academy. In 1892, he began teaching at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women. &quot;A born teacher, Henri enjoyed immediate success at the school.&quot;

== Work ==
In Philadelphia, Henri began to attract a group of followers who met in his studio to discuss art and culture, including several illustrators for the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; who would become known as the &quot;Philadelphia Four&quot;: William Glackens, George Luks, Everett Shinn, and John Sloan. They called themselves the Charcoal Club. Their gatherings featured life drawing, raucous socializing, and readings and discussions of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Émile Zola, Henry David Thoreau, William Morris Hunt, and George Moore.

===Ashcan School===

By 1895, Henri had come to reconsider his earlier love of Impressionism, calling it a &quot;new academicism.&quot; He was urging his friends and proteges to create a new, more realistic art that would speak directly to their own time and experience. He believed that it was the right moment for American painters to seek out fresh, less genteel subjects in the modern American city. The paintings by Henri, Sloan, Glackens, Luks, Shinn, and others of their acquaintance that were inspired by this outlook eventually came to be called the Ashcan School of American art. They spurned academic painting and Impressionism as an art of mere surfaces. Art critic Robert Hughes declared that, &quot;Henri wanted art to be akin to journalism. He wanted paint to be as real as mud, as the clods of horse-shit and snow, that froze on Broadway in the winter, as real a human product as sweat, carrying the unsuppressed smell of human life.&quot; Ashcan painters began to attract public attention in the same decade in which the realist fiction of Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris was finding its audience and the muckraking journalists were calling attention to slum conditions.

For several years, Henri divided his time between Philadelphia and Paris, where he met the Canadian artist James Wilson Morrice. Morrice introduced Henri to the practice of painting &quot;pochades&quot; on tiny wood panels that could be carried in a coat pocket along with a small kit of brushes and oil. This method facilitated the kind of spontaneous depictions of urban scenes which would come to be associated with his mature style.

In 1898, Henri married Linda Craige, a student from his private art class. The couple spent the next two years on an extended honeymoon in France, during which time Henri prepared canvases to submit to the Salon. In 1899 he exhibited &quot;Woman in Manteau&quot; and &quot;La Neige&quot; (&quot;The Snow&quot;), which was purchased by the French government for display in the &quot;Musée du Luxembourg&quot;. He taught at the Veltin School for Girls beginning in 1900 and at the New York School of Art from 1902, where his students included Joseph Stella, Edward Hopper and his future wife Josephine Nivison, Rockwell Kent, George Bellows, Norman Raeben, Louis D. Fancher, Stuart Davis and Carl Sprinchorn. In 1905, Linda, long in poor health, died. Three years later, Henri remarried; his new wife, Marjorie Organ, was a twenty-two-year-old cartoonist for the &quot;New York Journal.&quot; (Henri&#x27;s 1911 portrait of Marjorie, &quot;The Masquerade Dress,&quot; is one of his most famous paintings and hangs in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)

In 1906, Henri was elected to the National Academy of Design, but when painters in his circle were rejected for the academy&#x27;s 1907 exhibition, he accused fellow jurors of bias and walked off the jury, resolving to organize a show of his own. He would later refer to the academy as &quot;a cemetery of art.&quot;

===The Eight===

In 1908, Henri was one of the organizers of a landmark show entitled The Eight (after the eight painters displaying their works) at the Macbeth Galleries in New York. Besides his own works and those produced by the &quot;Philadelphia Four&quot; (who had followed Henri to New York by this time), three other artists who painted in a different, less realistic style—Maurice Prendergast, Ernest Lawson, and Arthur B. Davies—were included. The exhibition was intended as a protest against the exhibition policies and narrowness of taste of the National Academy of Design. The show later traveled to a number of cities from Newark to Chicago, prompting further discussion in the press about the revolt against academic art and the new ideas about acceptable subject matter in painting.

Henri was, by this point, at the heart of the group who argued for the depiction of urban life. He has given it urgency with slashing brush marks and strong tonal contrasts, learning from Winslow Homer, from Édouard Manet, and from Frans Hals&quot;.

In 1910, with the help of John Sloan and Walt Kuhn, Henri organized the Exhibition of The Independent Artists, the first nonjuried, no-prize show in the U.S., which he modeled after the &quot;Salon des Indépendants&quot; in France. Works were hung alphabetically to emphasize an egalitarian philosophy. The exhibition was very well-attended but resulted in few sales. The relationship between Henri and Sloan, both believers in Ashcan realism, was a close and productive one at this time; Kuhn would play a key role in the 1913 Armory Show. Biographer William Innes Homer writes: &quot;Henri&#x27;s emphasis on freedom and independence in art [as demonstrated in the Exhibition of Independent Artists], his rebuttal of everything the National Academy stood for, makes him the ideological father of the Armory Show.&quot;

The Armory Show, American&#x27;s first large-scale introduction to European Modernism, was a mixed experience for Henri. He exhibited five paintings but, as a representational artist, he naturally understood that Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism implied a challenge to his style of picture-making. In fact, he had cause to be worried. A man, not yet fifty, who saw himself in a vanguard was about to be relegated to the position of a conservative whose day had passed. Arthur B. Davies, an organizer of the show and a member of The Eight, was particularly disdainful of Henri&#x27;s concern that the new European art would overshadow the work of American artists. On the other hand, some Henri scholars have insisted that the reputation Henri earned in later histories as an opponent of the Armory Show and of Modernism in general is unfair and vastly overstates his objections. They point out that he had a keen interest in new art and recommended that his students avail themselves of opportunities to study it. &quot;[As] early as 1910, Henri advised students to attend an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse and two years later he urged them to see the work of Max Weber, one of the most avant-garde of American moderns.&quot;

===Ireland and Santa Fe===

Henri made several trips to Ireland&#x27;s western coast and rented Corrymore House near Dooagh, a small village on Achill Island, in 1913. Every spring and summer for the following years he would paint the children of Dooagh. Henri&#x27;s portraits of children, seen today as the most sentimental aspect of his body of work, were popular at the time and sold well. In 1924, he purchased Corrymore House. During the summers of 1916, 1917 and 1922, Henri went to Santa Fe, New Mexico to paint. He found that locale as inspirational as the countryside of Ireland had been. He became an important figure in the Santa Fe art scene and persuaded the director of the state art museum to adopt an open-door exhibition policy. He also persuaded fellow artists George Bellows, Leon Kroll, John Sloan and Randall Davey to come to Santa Fe. In 1918 he was elected as an associate member of the Taos Society of Artists.

===Death and burial===
While traveling to the United States after visiting his summer home in Ireland in November 1928, Robert Henri suffered an attack of neuritis, which crippled his leg. The underlying cause was metastatic prostate cancer. He was hospitalized at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in New York. Gradually he became weaker, until he died of cardiac arrest early in the morning of July 12, 1929. His illness was not generally known, and came as a surprise in art circles. Upon his death, artist and pupil Eugene Speicher said &quot;not only was he a great painter, but ... I don&#x27;t think it too much to call him the father of independent painting in this country.&quot; At his death, it was reported that he was cremated, and his ashes buried in the family vault in Philadelphia.

==Influence and legacy==
From 1915 to 1927, Henri was a popular and influential teacher at the Art Students League of New York. &quot;He gave his students, not a style (though some imitated him), but an attitude, an approach, [to art].&quot; He also lectured frequently about the theories of Hardesty Maratta, Denham Waldo Ross, and Jay Hambidge. (Henri&#x27;s interest in these men, whose ideas were in fashion at the time but were not taken seriously later, has proved to be &quot;the most misunderstood aspect of [Henri&#x27;s] pedagogy&quot;). Maratta and Ross were color theorists (Maratta manufactured his own system of synthetic pigments), while Hambidge was the author of an elaborate treatise, &quot;Dynamic Symmetry,&quot; that argued for a scientific basis for composition. Henri&#x27;s philosophical and practical musings were collected by former pupil Margery Ryerson and published as &quot;The Art Spirit&quot; (1923), a book that remained in print for several decades. Henri&#x27;s other students include George Bellows, Arnold Franz Brasz, Stuart Davis, Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent, Henry Ives Cobb, Jr., Lillian Cotton, Amy Londoner, John Sloan, Minerva Teichert, Peppino Mangravite, Rufus J. Dryer, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Mabel Killam Day, Mountfort Coolidge, and Channing Hare.

The significance and often formative influence of Henri as a teacher and mentor is estimable. He also was instrumental in promoting women to be artists.

In the spring of 1929, Henri was named as one of the top three living American artists by the Arts Council of New York. Henri died of cancer that summer at the age of sixty-four. He was eulogized by colleagues and former students and was honored with a memorial exhibition of seventy-eight paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Forbes Watson, editor of &quot;The Arts&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Henri, quite aside from his extraordinary personal charm, was an epoch-making man in the development of American art.&quot;

Fittingly, among Henri&#x27;s most enduring works are his portraits of his fellow painters. His 1904 full-length portrait of George Luks (in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa) and his 1904 portrait of John Sloan (in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, formerly in the collection of The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.), for example, exhibit all the classic elements of his style: forceful brushwork, intense (if dark) color effects, evocation of personality (his and the sitter&#x27;s), and generosity of spirit.

<text>Rodney D. Huddleston (born 4 April 1937) is a British linguist and grammarian specializing in the study and description of English.

Huddleston is the primary author of &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; (), which presents a comprehensive descriptive grammar of English.

== Early life and education ==
Huddleston was born in Cheshire, England, and attended Manchester Grammar School. Upon leaving school, he spent two years in the military completing National Service before enrolling at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, with a scholarship, where he graduated in 1960 with a First Class Honours degree in Modern and Medieval Languages.

After graduating from Cambridge, Huddleston earned his PhD in Applied Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh in 1963 under the supervision of Michael Halliday.

== Academic career ==
Huddleston held lectureships at the University of Edinburgh, University College London, and the University of Reading. In 1969, he moved to the University of Queensland, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was the recipient of the first round of &#x27;Excellence in Teaching&#x27; awards at the University of Queensland in 1988. In 1990, he was awarded a Personal Chair. He is currently an emeritus professor at the University of Queensland, where he taught until 1997.

=== Under Halliday ===
For some time, Huddleston ran a project under Halliday in the Communications Research Centre at The University of London called the “OSTI Programme in the Linguistic Properties of Scientific English.” (OSTI was the UK government&#x27;s Office for Scientific and Technical Information.) As a student of Halliday&#x27;s, Huddleston was a proponent of Systemic Functional Grammar, but as his thinking developed, he came to reject it.

=== &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; ===

==== Background ====

In 1988, Huddleston published a very critical review of the 1985 book &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot;. He wrote:[T]here are some respects in which it is seriously flawed and disappointing. A number of quite basic categories and concepts do not seem to have been thought through with sufficient care; this results in a remarkable amount of unclarity and inconsistency in the analysis, and in the organization of the grammar.A year later, he decided that he would have to produce a grammar that did a better job. He was awarded a special projects grant by The University of Queensland to the project and began work on what was provisionally titled &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of English&quot;. From 1989 to 1995, workshops were held two or three times a year in Brisbane and Sydney to develop ideas for the framework and content.Intellectually, these were intense and exhausting sessions but they were associated with extremely enjoyable social gatherings. In some ways it is the social side of these events that lingers in the memory long after the details of linguistic discussion are forgotten. We remember particularly dawn jogs to Alexandra Beach from Rodney’s house at Sunshine Beach, pool volleyball and table tennis games fought with great ferocity, and walks through Noosa National Park with spectacular sunsets over Noosa Bay.Geoff Pullum joined the project in 1995, after Huddleston &quot;bemoaned the problems he was having in maintaining the momentum of this huge project, at that time already five years underway&quot;.

==== Publication and reception ====

The book was published in 2002. In 2004, Peter Culicover wrote:&quot;The Cambridge grammar of the English language&quot; (&quot;CGEL&quot;) is a monumentally impressive piece of work. Already published reviews of this work do not overstate its virtues: &#x27;a notable achievement&#x27;; &#x27;authoritative, interesting, reasonably priced (for a book of this size), beautifully designed, well proofread, and enjoyable to handle&#x27;; &#x27;superbly produced and designed&#x27;; &#x27;one of the most superb works of academic scholarship ever to appear on the English linguistics scene ... a monumental work that offers easily the most comprehensive and thought-provoking treatment of English grammar to date. Nothing rivals this work, with respect to breadth, depth and consistency of coverage&#x27;. I fully agree with these sentiments. Huddleston, Pullum, and collaborators definitely deserve a prize for this achievement.That same year, the book won the Leonard Bloomfield Book Award of the Linguistic Society of America.

== Views ==
Huddleston&#x27;s grammatical frameworks, such as that in the &quot;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, have been monotonic phrase-structure grammars, similar to X-bar theory but with explicit notation for syntactic functions such as subject, modifier, and complement. Monotonic phrase-structure grammars are based on the idea that the structure of sentences can be represented as a hierarchy of constituents, with each level of the hierarchy corresponding to a different level of grammatical organization. X-bar theory is a specific type of phrase-structure grammar that posits a uniform structure for all phrasal categories, with each phrase containing a &quot;head&quot; and optional specifier and/or complement.

The key difference between monotonic phrase-structure grammars and generative grammars like transformational-generative grammar (TGG) is the absence of transformations or movement operations in the former. Monotonic grammars maintain that the structure of a sentence remains fixed from its initial formation, whereas generative grammars propose that sentences can undergo various transformations during the derivation process.

He believes that some kind of fusion of functions accounts for noun phrases that lack noun heads.

=== Other ===
In 1999, a &quot;&quot; volume was produced &quot;by colleagues past and present, friends and admirers of Rodney Huddleston, in order to honour his consistently outstanding contribution to grammatical theory and description&quot;: &quot;The Clause in English: In Honour of Rodney Huddleston&quot;.

Huddleston and his wife Vivienne now reside on Sunshine Coast, near Noosa Heads in Queensland, Australia.

<doc id="1000202" wikidata="Q1149498" url="?curid=1000202" title="Salome (play)">
<text>Salome (French: Salomé, ) is a one-act tragedy by Oscar Wilde. The original version of the play was first published in French in 1893; an English translation was published a year later. The play depicts the attempted seduction of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) by Salome, stepdaughter of Herod Antipas; her dance of the seven veils; the execution of Jokanaan at Salome&#x27;s instigation; and her death on Herod&#x27;s orders.

The first production was in Paris in 1896. Because the play depicted biblical characters it was banned in Britain and was not performed publicly there until 1931. The play became popular in Germany, and Wilde&#x27;s text was taken by the composer Richard Strauss as the basis of his 1905 opera &quot;Salome&quot;, the international success of which has overshadowed Wilde&#x27;s original play. Film and other adaptations have been made of the play.

==Background and first production==
When Wilde began writing &quot;Salome&quot; in late 1891 he was known as an author and critic, but was not yet established as a playwright. &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; was completed but not yet staged, and his other West End successes, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, were yet to come. He had been considering the subject of Salome since his undergraduate days at Oxford when Walter Pater introduced him to Flaubert&#x27;s story &quot;Hérodias&quot; in 1877. The biographer Peter Raby comments that Wilde&#x27;s interest had been further stimulated by descriptions of Gustave Moreau&#x27;s paintings of Salome in Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27;s &quot;À rebours&quot; and by Heinrich Heine&#x27;s &quot;Atta Troll&quot;, Jules Laforgue&#x27;s &quot;Salomé&quot; in &quot;Moralités Légendaires&quot; and Stéphane Mallarmé&#x27;s &quot;Hérodiade&quot;.

Wilde wrote the play while staying in Paris and explained to an interviewer the following year why he had written it in French:

He submitted the play to the leading French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who accepted it for production in her 1892 season at the Royal English Opera House, in London. The play went into rehearsals in June, but at that time all plays presented in Britain had to be approved by the official censor, the Lord Chamberlain. Approval was withheld because of a rule prohibiting the depiction of biblical characters on stage. Wilde expressed outrage and said he would leave England and take French citizenship. Bernhardt too condemned the ban and said she would present the play in Paris at some time, although she could not say when.

The play was published in French in 1893 in Paris by the Librairie de l&#x27;Art Independent and in London by Elkin Mathews and John Lane. It is dedicated &quot;À mon ami Pierre Louÿs&quot;. The author was pleased by the favourable reception given to the published play by leading Francophone writers, in particular Pierre Loti, Maurice Maeterlinck and Mallarmé.

Wilde never saw the play produced. The only performances given in his lifetime were in 1896, by which time he was serving a prison sentence for illegal homosexual activity. The play was first given, in the original French, in a one-off performance on 11 February 1896 by the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre company at the Théâtre de la Comédie-Parisienne, as the second part of a double bill with Romain Coolus&#x27;s comedy &quot;Raphaël&quot;. The main roles were played as follows:
*Iokanaan – Max Barbier
*Hérode – Lugné-Poe
*Young Syrian – M. Nerey
*A Jew – M. Labruyère
*First Soldier – M. Lévêque
*Salomé – Lina Munte
*Hérodias – Mlle Barbieri
*Page to Hérodias – Suzanne Auclaire
The play was given again in October 1896 in a Wilde double bill at the Nouveau-Théâtre, with a French adaptation of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;. Charles Daumerie played Herod and Munte again played Salome.

==English and other translations==

A biographer of Wilde, Owen Dudley Edwards, comments that the play &quot;is apparently untranslatable into English&quot;, citing attempts made by Lord Alfred Douglas, Aubrey Beardsley, Wilde himself revising Douglas&#x27;s botched effort, Wilde&#x27;s son Vyvyan Holland, Jon Pope, Steven Berkoff and others, and concluding &quot;it demands reading and performance in French to make its impact&quot;. The most familiar English version is by Douglas, extensively revised by Wilde, originally published in 1894. Wilde dedicated the first edition &quot;To my friend Lord Alfred Douglas, the translator of my play&quot;. It was lavishly produced, with illustrations by Beardsley that Wilde thought over-sophisticated. An American edition, with the Beardsley illustrations, was published in San Francisco in 1896. In the 1890s and 1900s translations were published in at least eleven other languages, from Dutch in 1893 to Yiddish in 1909.

===Synopsis===
Jokanaan (John the Baptist, Iokanaan in the original French text) has been imprisoned by Herod Antipas in a cistern below the terrace of Herod&#x27;s palace, for his hostile comments about Herodias, Herod&#x27;s second wife. A young captain of the guard admires the beautiful princess Salome, Herod&#x27;s stepdaughter. A page warns the captain that something terrible may happen if he continues to stare at the princess. Salome is fascinated by Jokanaan&#x27;s voice. She persuades the captain to open the cistern so that the prophet can emerge, and she can see him and touch him. Jokanaan appears, denouncing Herodias and her husband. At first frightened by the sight of the holy man, Salome becomes fascinated by him, begging him to let her touch his hair, his skin and kiss his mouth. When she tells him she is Herodias&#x27;s daughter, he calls her a &quot;daughter of Sodom&quot; and bids her keep away from him. All Salome&#x27;s attempts to attract him fail, and he swears she will never kiss his mouth, cursing her as the daughter of an adulteress and advising her to seek the Lord. He returns to his underground confinement. The young captain of the guard, unable to bear Salome&#x27;s desire for another man, fatally stabs himself.

Herod appears from the palace, looking for the princess and commenting on the strange look of the moon. When he slips in the captain&#x27;s blood, he suddenly panics. Herodias dismisses his fears and asks him to go back inside with her, but Herod&#x27;s attention has turned libidinously towards Salome, who rejects his advances. From the cistern, Jokanaan resumes his denunciation of Herodias; she demands that Herod hand the prophet over to the Jews. Herod refuses, maintaining that Jokanaan is a holy man and has seen God. His words spark an argument among the Jews concerning the true nature of God, and two Nazarenes talk about the miracles of Jesus. As Jokanaan continues to accuse her, Herodias demands that he is silenced.
Herod asks Salome to dance for him. She refuses, but when he promises to give her anything she wants, she agrees. Ignoring her mother&#x27;s pleas – &quot;Ne dansez pas, ma fille&quot; – &quot;Do not dance, my daughter&quot; – Salome performs the dance of the seven veils. Delighted, Herod asks what reward she would like, and she asks for the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter. Horrified, Herod refuses, while Herodias rejoices at Salome&#x27;s choice. Herod offers other rewards, but Salome insists and reminds Herod of his promise. He finally yields. The executioner descends into the cistern, and Salome impatiently awaits her reward. When the prophet&#x27;s head is brought to her, she passionately addresses Jokanaan as if he were still alive and finally kisses his lips:

Herod, frightened and appalled at Salome&#x27;s behaviour, orders the soldiers, &quot;Tuez cette femme!&quot; – &quot;Kill that woman!&quot;, and they crush her to death under their shields.

==Revivals==
===International===
In 1901, within a year of Wilde&#x27;s death, &quot;Salome&quot; was produced in Berlin by Max Reinhardt in Hedwig Lachmann&#x27;s German translation, and ran, according to Robbie Ross, for &quot;a longer consecutive period in Germany than any play by any Englishman, not excepting Shakespeare&quot;. The play was not revived in Paris until 1973 (although Richard Strauss&#x27;s operatic version was frequently seen there from 1910 onwards). Les Archives du spectacle record 13 productions of Wilde&#x27;s play in France between 1973 and 2020.

The American premiere was given in New York in 1905 by the Progressive Stage Society, an amateur group. A professional production was presented at the Astor Theatre the following year, with Mercedes Leigh in the title role. The Internet Broadway Database records five New York productions between 1917 and 2003. The Salomes included Evelyn Preer (1923), Sheryl Lee (1992) and Marisa Tomei (2003), and among the actors playing Herod was Al Pacino in 1992 and 2003.

The play was given in Czech in Brno in 1924, and in English at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in 1928 (directed by Hilton Edwards, with Micheál Mac Liammóir as Jokanaan). In Tokyo in 1960 Yukio Mishima directed a Japanese version in a translation by Kōnosuke Hinatsu which, &quot;The Times&quot; reported, &quot;rendered Wilde&#x27;s rhetoric into the measured cadences of fifteenth-century Japanese&quot;. A later Japanese production was seen in Tokyo and subsequently in France in 1996.

===Britain===
In Britain, the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s consent to public performance still being withheld, the first production there was given in May 1905 in a private performance in London by the New Stage Club, in which the performance of Robert Farquharson as Herod was reportedly of remarkable power. Millicent Murby played Salome, and Florence Farr directed. A second private performance followed in 1906 by the Literary Theatre Society, with Farquharson again as Herod. The costumes and scenery by Charles Ricketts were much admired, but the rest of the cast and the direction were poor, according to Ross. A 1911 production at the Court Theatre by Harcourt Williams, with Adeline Bourne as Salome, received disparaging notices.

The ban on public performance of Salome was not lifted until 1931. The last &quot;private&quot; production, earlier that year, featuring a dance of the seven veils choreographed by Ninette de Valois, was judged &quot;creepily impressive&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. For the first sanctioned public production, at the Savoy Theatre, Farquharson reprised his Herod, with real-life mother and daughter casting, Nancy Price and Joan Maude as Herodias and Salome. The production was deemed tame and unthrilling, and the play – &quot;gone modest and middle class&quot; as one critic put it – was not seen again in the West End for more than twenty years.

A 1954 London revival, a vehicle for the Australian actor Frank Thring, made little impact, and it was not until Lindsay Kemp&#x27;s 1977 production at the Roundhouse that &quot;Salome&quot; was established as a critical and box-office success, running for six months in repertory with Kemp&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot;. That version was a free adaptation of the original, with an all-male cast, switching between French and English texts and using only about a third of Wilde&#x27;s dialogue. A 1988 production by Steven Berkoff in which he played Herod, was seen at the Gate Theatre, the Edinburgh Festival and at the National Theatre, London. It focused on Wilde&#x27;s words, relying on the skills of the actors and the imagination of audiences to evoke the setting and action. A 2017 production by the Royal Shakespeare Company, described as &quot;gender fluid&quot;, featured a male actor, Matthew Tennyson, as Salome.

==Critical reception==
In &quot;Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique&quot;, Edouard Stoullig reported that press reviews had been generally benevolent out of protest at the harsh treatment received by Wilde in Britain. In Stoullig&#x27;s view the play was a good piece of rhetoric marred by too many &quot;ridiculous repetitions&quot; of lines by minor characters. In &quot;Le Figaro&quot; Henry Fouquier shared Stoullig&#x27;s view that the piece owed something to Flaubert, and thought it &quot;an exercise in romantic literature, not badly done, a little boring&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;Le Temps&quot; said, &quot;M. Wilde has certainly read Flaubert, and cannot forget it. The most interesting thing about &quot;Salome&quot; is the style. The work was written in French by M. Wilde. It is full of very elaborate and ornate verses. The colours, the stars, the birds, the rare gems, everything that adorns nature, has provided M. Wilde with points of comparison and ingenious themes for the stanzas and antistrophes that &quot;Salome&#x27;s&quot; characters utter&quot;. &quot;La Plume&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Salomé&quot; has almost all the qualities of a poem, the prose is as musical and fluid as verse, full of images and metaphors&quot;.

When banning the original 1892 production of &quot;Salome&quot;, the responsible official in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office commented privately, &quot;The piece is written in French – half Biblical, half pornographic – by Oscar Wilde himself. Imagine the average British public&#x27;s reception of it&quot;. In Britain the critics in general either ignored or disparaged the play. &quot;The Times&quot; described it as &quot;an arrangement in blood and ferocity, morbid, bizarre, repulsive, and very offensive in its adaptation of scriptural phraseology to situations the reverse of sacred&quot;. &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; suggested that the play was far from original: &quot;the reader of &quot;Salome&quot; seems to stand in the Island of Voices, and to hear around him and about the utterances of friends, the whisperings of demigods&quot; – particularly Gautier, Maeterlinck and above all Flaubert – &quot;There is no freshness in Mr Wilde&#x27;s ideas; there is no freshness in his method of presenting those ideas&quot;. New York reviewers were not impressed when the play was first professionally produced there in 1906: &quot;The Sun&quot; called it &quot;bloodily degenerate&quot;; &quot;The New-York Tribune&quot; thought it &quot;decadent stuff, not worthy of notice&quot;.

Raby comments that later criticism of the play &quot;has tended to treat it either as a literary text or as a theatrical aberration&quot;. The historian John Stokes writes that &quot;Salome&quot; is a rare instance in British theatrical history of an authentically Symbolist drama. Symbolist authors rejected naturalism and used &quot;poetic language and pictorial settings to invoke the inner lives of characters&quot;, expressing without the constraints of naturalism all kinds of emotions &quot;both spiritual and sensual&quot;.

==Themes and derivatives==
Critics have analysed Wilde&#x27;s use of images favoured by Israel&#x27;s kingly poets and references to the moon, his depiction of power-play between the sexes, his filling in of gaps in the biblical narrative and his invention of the &quot;dance of the seven veils&quot;.
Wilde&#x27;s version of the story spawned several other artistic works, the most famous of which is Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera of the same name. Strauss saw Wilde&#x27;s play in Berlin in November 1902 at Reinhardt&#x27;s Little Theatre, with Gertrud Eysoldt in the title role. He began to compose his opera in summer 1903, completing it in 1905 and premiering it later the same year. Critics including Horst Schroeder have argued that the international success of Strauss&#x27;s adaptation &quot;virtually drove Wilde&#x27;s drama in its original form off the stage&quot;.

There have been numerous adaptations and interpretations of Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, on stage and screen and in the visual arts. In St Petersburg in 1908 Mikhail Fokine created a ballet based on the play, with music by Glazunov and décor by Léon Bakst. Ida Rubinstein played Salome. For the cinema, &quot;Salome&quot; was first filmed in an American silent version directed by J. Stuart Blackton in 1908, with Florence Lawrence as Salome and Maurice Costello as Herod, followed by an Italian version in 1910. Later adaptations include a 1918 silent film starring Theda Bara, a 1923 silent version directed by Charles Bryant starring Alla Nazimova as Salome and Mitchell Lewis as Herod, and a 2013 sound adaptation directed by and starring Al Pacino, with Jessica Chastain as Salome. Excerpts from the play featured prominently in Ken Russell&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Salome&#x27;s Last Dance&quot;.

<text>Master of the Horse is an official position in several European nations. It was more common when most countries in Europe were monarchies, and is of varying prominence today.

== (ancient Rome)==
The original Master of the Horse () in the Roman Republic was an office appointed and dismissed by the Roman Dictator, and expired with the Dictator&#x27;s own office, typically a term of six months in the early and mid-republic. The served as the Dictator&#x27;s main lieutenant. The Dictator nominated the , unless a specified, as was sometimes the case, the appointee. The Dictator could not rule without a to assist him, and, consequently, if the first either died or was dismissed during the Dictator&#x27;s term, another had to be nominated in his stead.

The was granted a form of , but at the same level as a , and thus was subject to the of the Dictator and his powers were not superior to those of a Consul. In the Dictator&#x27;s absence, the became his representative, and exercised the same powers as the Dictator. It was usually, but not always, necessary for the to have already held the office of . Accordingly, the had the insignia of a : the and an escort of six . The most famous Master of the Horse is Mark Antony, who served during Julius Caesar&#x27;s first dictatorship, with disastrous results. As a result of this, Caesar appointed Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had a history of successful administration over the city of Rome and Hispania Citerior, to replace Antony and govern in Rome when Caesar went to suppress the renewed Civil War in North Africa.

After the constitutional reforms of Augustus, the office of Dictator fell into disuse, along with that of the . The title was revived in the late Empire, when Constantine I established it as one of the supreme military ranks, alongside the (&quot;Master of the Foot&quot;). Eventually, the two offices would be amalgamated into that of the (&quot;Master of the Soldiers&quot;).

The title Constable, from the Latin or count of the stables, has a similar history.

==Master of the Horse (United Kingdom)==
===Historical role===
The Master of the Horse in the United Kingdom was once an important official of the sovereign&#x27;s household, though the role is largely ceremonial today. The master of the horse is the third dignitary of the court, and was always a member of the ministry (before 1782 the office was of cabinet rank), a peer and a privy councillor. All matters connected with the horses and formerly also the hounds of the sovereign, as well as the stables and coachhouses, the stud, mews and previously the kennels, are within his jurisdiction.

The practical management of the Royal Stables and stud devolves on the chief or Crown Equerry, formerly called the Gentleman of the Horse, whose appointment was always permanent. The Clerk Marshal had the supervision of the accounts of the department before they are submitted to the Board of Green Cloth, and was in waiting on the Sovereign on state occasions only.

Exclusive of the Crown Equerry there were seven regular equerries, besides extra and honorary equerries, one of whom was always in attendance on the Sovereign and rode at the side of the royal carriage. They were always officers of the army, and each of them was on duty for about the same time as the lords and grooms in waiting. There are still several pages of honour who are nominally in the master of the horse&#x27;s department, who must not be confounded with the pages of various kinds who are in the department of the Lord Chamberlain. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on him or her at state ceremonies. At King Charles III&#x27;s coronation they assisted the Groom of the Robes in carrying the royal train.

===Modern role===
The current Master of the Horse is Henry Ashton, 4th Baron Ashton of Hyde.

Today the Master of the Horse has a primarily ceremonial office, and rarely appears except on state occasions, and especially when the Sovereign is mounted. The Crown Equerry has daily oversight of the Royal Mews, which provides vehicular transport for the Sovereign, both cars and horse-drawn carriages. Train travel is arranged by the Royal Travel Office, which also co-ordinates air transport.

The Pages of Honour, who appear only on ceremonial occasions, and the Equerries, were nominally under the authority of the Master of the Horse. The former are now controlled by the Keeper of the Privy Purse. The latter are effectively independent, and are functionally closer to the Private Secretary&#x27;s Office. There are now three equerries to the Sovereign, and a larger number of extra equerries: usually retired officers with some connection to the Royal Household. The extra equerries are rarely if ever required for duty, but the Equerries are in attendance on the Sovereign on a daily basis. For some years the senior Equerry has also held the position of Deputy Master of the Household. The permanent equerry is an officer of major rank or equivalent, recruited from the three armed services in turn. Many previous equerries have gone on to reach high rank. The temporary equerry is a Captain of the Coldstream Guards, who provides part-time attendance. When not required for duty he has additional regimental or staff duties. Senior members of the royal family also have one or two equerries.

==Grand Squire of France==
In France, the master of the horse, known as the Grand Squire of France (&#x27;, or more usually &#x27;) was one of the seven Great Officers of the Crown of France from 1595. As well as the superintendence of the royal stables, he had that of the retinue of the sovereign, also the charge of the funds set aside for the religious functions of the court, coronations, etc. On the death of a sovereign he had the right to all the horses and their equipment in the royal stables. He oversaw personally the &quot;Great Stable&quot; (). Distinct from this officer and independent of him, was the first equerry (), who had charge of the horses which the sovereign used personally (), and who attended on him when he rode out. The office of master of the horse existed down to the reign of Louis XVI. Under Louis XVIII and Charles X the duties were discharged by the first equerry, but under Napoleon I and Napoleon III the office was revived with much of its old importance.

==Oberststallmeister (Austria) ==
In the Habsburg monarchy, the Oberststallmeister, together with the Obersthofmeister, Oberstkämmerer and Oberstmarschall, was one of the four principal functions on the Court, reserved to the high nobility. The Oberststallmeister was in charge of the court stables, the riding school and the fleet of court carriages and other forms of transport. The thoroughbred horses and magnificent equipages were a cornerstone of aristocratic display, that gave this function its prestige. 
==Oberststallmeister (Germany)==
In Germany the master of the horse (Oberststallmeister) was a high court dignitary in several German Courts.
In the Holy Roman Empire, his office was merely titular, the superintendence of the Emperor&#x27;s stables having been carried out by the &quot;Oberstallmeister&quot;, an official corresponding to the crown equerry in England.

==Caballerizo mayor (Spain)==
The Caballerizo mayor was the Officer of the Royal Household and Heritage of the Crown of Spain in charge of the trips, the mews and the hunt of the King of Spain.

The Office of &quot;Caballerizo mayor&quot; was one of the main Offices of the Royal Household in charge of the Royal Stables and everything related to the transportation of the Monarch. When the King sorted out from the Royal Palace, the Caballerizo had the main position behind him and the major rang over the other Court Officials. He managed as well the stables, the carriages and the horses. He was assisted by the &quot;Primeros Caballerizos&quot; (First Equerries) who were nominated by him.

He was in charge of the Royal hunt as &quot;Montero mayor&quot; (Great Hunter) holding, in many cases, the &quot;Alcaldías&quot; (Majorships) of the Spanish royal sites.

==Papal Master of the Horse==

The Master of the Horse, Cavallerizzo Maggiore, or Hereditary Superintendent of the Stables of the Palaces, was a hereditary position held by the Marquess Serlupi Crescenzi. The office was a Participating Privy Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape, in the papal household. It was abolished in the reforms of the Papal Curia of 1968.

==Riksstallmästare/Överhovstallmästare (Sweden)==
The holder of the title Master of the Horse of the Realm (&quot;Riksstallmästare&quot;) in Sweden was not one of the Great Officers of the Realm, but rather one of the Lesser Officers of the Realm. He was the superintendent of the Royal Stables and of the realm&#x27;s stud farms. As such he was important in military matters, and often he had a tight connection with the army, and then especially with the army&#x27;s cavalry units. His duties were partly taken over by the Master of the Horse (&quot;Överhovstallmästare&quot;).

==Equerry (Russia)==
&quot;Konyushy&quot; (Russian: &quot;Конюший&quot;) is literally translated as Master of the Horse or Equerry.

Konyushy was a boyar in charge of the stables of Russian rulers. It was a high title at the court of Russian rulers until the 17th century. By the end of the 15th century a special Equerry Office (конюшенный приказ, &quot;konyushenny prikaz&quot;) was introduced, headed by the Konyushy. It was in charge of the Tsar&#x27;s stables, parade equipage, ceremonies of court ride-offs, and military horse breeding. At one point Boris Godunov was konyushy. The Equerry Office handled a significant amount of Tsar&#x27;s treasures, related to harness and horse/horseman armor, which were transferred to the Kremlin Armoury in 1736.

==Koniuszy (Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania)==
&quot;Koniuszy&quot; (corresponding to the English-language &quot;Equerry&quot; or &quot;Master of the Horse&quot;) was a position of nobility known in the Kingdom of Poland from the 11th century, and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 15th. A &quot;koniuszy&quot; had charge of the stables and herds of a Grand Duke or King; in reality, it was a &quot;podkoniuszy&quot; (sub-equerry), subordinate to the &quot;koniuszy&quot;, who had the more direct responsibility.

From the 14th to 16th centuries, a &quot;koniuszy&quot; was a dignitary (&quot;dygnitarz&quot;) in the Polish Kingdom and in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

== Georgia ==
In the Kingdom of Georgia, the similar post was known under the name of &quot;amilakhvari&quot; (&quot;amir-akhori&quot;, lit.: Prince-Master of the Horse), derived from Arabic. It was a deputy to the commander-in-chief (&quot;amir-spasalari&quot;) and a member of the royal council. From the 1460s to the Russian annexation of Georgia (1801), the office was hereditary in the Zevdginidze-Amilakhvari family.

== Hungary ==
In the Kingdom of Hungary the master of the horse (Hungarian: &quot;főlovászmester&quot;) was one of the high officials of the royal household.

==Asia==
Similar posts were common in the imperial courts of China and Japan, the royal courts of Korea, and elsewhere in East Asia. The position, known as &quot;Sima&quot; in Chinese (司马), literally means &quot;Master of the Horse&quot;. It was first created in the Western Zhou dynasty, with responsibility for military administration and conscription. The position was below the Three Grand Offices and equivalent in status to the six ministers. It was often grouped with four other positions also named with the &quot;Si-&quot; (control, administer) prefix as the &quot;five officials&quot; (五官). The title was used in different ways in subsequent dynasties. The Han Dynasty awarded &quot;Grand Sima&quot; as an additional title to high generals, in which context it is often translated into English as &quot;Marshal&quot;.

&quot;Sima&quot; also became a Chinese surname, adopted by descendants of one occupant of the office. The Sima family became emperors in the Jin dynasty, as a result of which &quot;Sima&quot; ceased to exist as an official position in the central bureaucracy. However, in later dynasties it was used as the name of various relatively minor positions in the military and local administration, and was also used informally to refer to the Minister of War.

The Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya had a Master of the Royal Elephants. The holder of this office was titled &quot;Krom Phra Gajapala&quot; (). Beneath him in rank was a Master of the Royal Horse who was titled &quot;Krom Phra Asvaraja&quot; (). This demonstrated that the ancient Siamese attached more importance to the maintenance of war Elephant than a cavalry force.

<text>The minuet step is the dance step performed in the dance minuet. It &quot;is composed of four plain straight Steps or Walks, and may be performed forwards, backward, sideways, &amp;c.&quot; or in a square. The steps are often referred to by direction to distinguish them. &quot;A Movement, or Sink and Rise, being added to the first Step of the three belonging to the Minuet Step, produces a Bouree; and the like to the fourth and last a Half Coupee, which together compose what is commonly called the English Minuet Step&quot; .

&quot;The second Method of its Performance is with a Bound; that is to say, instead of the Half Coupee or Movement to the last Step made upon the Floor, as in the aforesaid, you bound instead thereof, which is the only Variation from the foregoing&quot; .

&quot;The third Method is quite the Reverse, because, instead of the Bouree, the Half Coupee is made first and afterwards the Bouree, or as the French term it, One and a Fleuret, which is usually called the French Step&quot; .

&quot;The fourth Way of performing this Step is, by adding another Movement to the third Step of the aforesaid Fleuret, or the fourth of the Minuet Step; and it will then be notwithstanding the same Step, only of three Movements. As to the two first foregoing Steps, I shall say little concerning them, for the following Reasons: In the first Place, because they are now rarely, if ever, practised amongst Persons of the first Rank, and seem to be, for the present, intirely laid aside; not as being ungraceful, or that the Dancer could not give Pleasure to the Beholders, or raise to himself a Reputation, in their Performance, but merely through Alteration of Fashion, which varies in this Respect, as in Dressing, &amp;c.&quot; . 

Variation and ornamentation of the basic steps was applied in three ways: (1) &quot;ad libitum&quot; variation on the frequency and order of the basic figures, (2) &quot;ad libitum&quot; variation of the step-pattern and ornamental foot and hand movements, and (3) special variant choreographies (&quot;menuets figurees&quot;) created by dancing masters for special occasions, for particular pupils, or for published manuals (these often required specially composed music to fit the choreographies) .

<text>Geoffrey Keith Pullum (; born 8 March 1945) is a British and American linguist specialising in the study of English. Pullum has published over 300 articles and books on various topics in linguistics, including phonology, morphology, semantics, pragmatics, computational linguistics, and philosophy of language. He is Professor Emeritus of General Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh.

Pullum is a co-author of &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; (2002), a comprehensive descriptive grammar of English. He was co-founder of &quot;Language Log&quot; and a contributor to Lingua Franca at &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, often criticizing prescriptive rules and linguistic myths.

== Early life ==
Geoffrey K. Pullum was born in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland, on 8 March 1945, and moved to West Wickham, England, while very young.

== Career as a musician ==
He left secondary school at age 16 and toured Germany as a pianist in the rock and roll band Sonny Stewart and the Dynamos. A year and a half later, he returned to England and co-founded a soul band with Pete Gage, which became Geno Washington &amp; the Ram Jam Band when Geno Washington joined. Pullum went by the name of Jeff Wright. The group had two of the biggest selling UK albums of the 1960s, both of which were live albums. Their most commercially successful album, &quot;Hand Clappin, Foot Stompin, Funky-Butt ... Live!&quot;, was in the UK Albums Chart for 38 weeks in 1966 and 1967, peaking at number 5. The other album was &quot;Hipster Flipsters Finger Poppin&#x27; Daddies&quot;, which reached number 8 on the same chart. The singles included &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Hi Hi Hazel&quot;, &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; and &quot;Michael (the Lover)&quot;.

== Education ==
After the band broke up, Pullum enrolled in the University of York in 1968, graduating in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours. In 1976 he completed a PhD in Linguistics at University College London, where his thesis supervisor was Neil Smith.

== Career as a linguist ==
Pullum&#x27;s work in the 1970s with Desmond Derbyshire, for whom he was the primary doctoral supervisor, established the existence of object-initial languages.

Pullum left Britain in 1980, taking visiting positions at the University of Washington and Stanford University. He contributed significantly to the development of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar. In 1983, he and Arnold Zwicky showed that &quot;n&#x27;t&quot; is a negative inflectional morpheme, and not simply a contraction of &quot;not&quot;.

In 1987, he became a United States citizen. He worked at the University of California, Santa Cruz, from 1981 to 2007. He was Dean of Graduate Studies and Research from 1987 to 1993. From 1983 to 1989, he wrote the regular &quot;Topic Comment&quot; pieces in &quot;Natural Language and Linguistic Theory.&quot;

In 1995, Pullum started to collaborate with Rodney Huddleston and other linguists on &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, which was published in 2002 and won the Leonard Bloomfield Book Award of the Linguistic Society of America in 2004.

From 1998 until 2002, he produced 10 &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; talks for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 2000, he published, in the style of Dr. Seuss, a proof of Turing&#x27;s theorem that the halting problem is recursively unsolvable. In 2003, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2004, Barbara Scholz, Pullum, and James Rogers initiated a group project on the applications of model theory in syntax, which was supported by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University in 2005–2006.

In 2007, he moved to the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, University of Edinburgh, where he was Professor of General Linguistics and at one time Head of Linguistics and English Language. In 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, and, in 2019, a Member of Academia Europaea. He became emeritus professor in 2020.

=== Views ===

==== Linguistic theory ====

Pullum argues against the view, broadly held in linguistics, that languages are scientific objects of study.

It seems to me that the notion of &#x27;a language&#x27; should not be regarded as scientifically reconstructable at all. We can say in very broad terms that a human language is a characteristic way of structuring expressions shared by a speech community; but that is extremely vague, and has to remain so. The vagueness is ineliminable, and unproblematic. Human languages are no more scientifically definable than human cultures, ethnic groups, or cities. The most we can say about what it means to say of a person that they speak Japanese is that the person knows, at least to some approximation, how to structure linguistic expressions in the Japanese way (with object before verb, and postpositions, and so on). But in scientific terms there is no such object as &#x27;Japanese&#x27;.

He also argues that we do not and cannot know whether human languages consist of a finite set of sentences. Pullum advocates for a model-theoretic approach to grammar rather than a generative one. This perspective emphasizes understanding the formal properties of languages, focusing on the relationship between structures and their interpretations, rather than rules that generate those structures. In other words, model-theoretic grammars aim to describe the possible structures in a language, rather than focusing on the process of generating sentences.

Pullum&#x27;s grammatical frameworks, such as that in &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, have been monotonic phrase-structure grammars, similar to X-bar theory but with explicit notation for syntactic functions such as subject, modifier, and complement. Monotonic phrase-structure grammars are based on the idea that the structure of sentences can be represented as a hierarchy of constituents, with each level of the hierarchy corresponding to a different level of grammatical organization. X-bar theory is a specific type of phrase-structure grammar that posits a uniform structure for all phrasal categories, with each phrase containing a &quot;head&quot; and optional specifier and/or complement.

The key difference between monotonic phrase-structure grammars and generative grammars like transformational-generative grammar (TGG) is the absence of transformations or movement operations in the former. Monotonic grammars maintain that the structure of a sentence remains fixed from its initial formation, whereas generative grammars propose that sentences can undergo various transformations during the derivation process.

Pullum argues that the traditional notion of a noun phrase is correct, and that the so-called DP hypothesis is mistaken. He believes that some kind of fusion of functions accounts for some of the data leading to the disagreement.

==== Criticism of Chomsky ====
Pullum has been a long-time critic of Noam Chomsky, whom he accuses of mendacity, plagiarism, and general academic dishonesty. He has attacked the argument from the poverty of the stimulus in multiple publications. He has called Chomsky&#x27;s Minimalist Program &quot;really just a repertoire of hints, suggestions, and buzzwords&quot;, has said that concepts such as Deep Structure and Recursion have &quot;come to nothing&quot;, called Chomsky&#x27;s idea that language arose as a result of a genetic mutation &quot;utterly eccentric&quot;, and regretted that Chomsky &quot;turned the discipline of syntactic theory into a personality cult&quot;.

=== Coinings ===
Pullum has coined or prompted the coining of a number of terms that have come to be popularly used including &quot;eggcorn&quot;, &quot;snowclone&quot;, and &quot;linguification&quot;.
