<text>María Guadalupe Araujo Yong (born December 10, 1955), known professionally as Ana Gabriel, is a Mexican singer and songwriter. With over 40 million records sold worldwide, Gabriel is the best-selling Mexican female artist, and one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time. Dubbed as the &quot;Diva de América&quot; and the &quot;Luna de América&quot;, during her long career, she has performed different genres of music (primarily Latin pop, Latin ballad and Ranchera).

As of 2013, Gabriel had released twenty studio albums, three live albums, and fifteen compilation albums. Three of Gabriel&#x27;s albums have topped the Top Latin Albums chart, and has achieved 7 number-one singles and 20 top 10 hits on the Hot Latin Songs chart, including &quot;Ay Amor&quot;, &quot;Es Demasiado Tarde&quot;, and &quot;Quién Como Tú&quot;; for which she has been named the chart&#x27;s seventh Greatest of All Time Artist.

She was included among the Greatest Latin Artists of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Her accolades include a Grammy Award nomination, four Latin Grammy Award nominations, five &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, thirteen Lo Nuestro Awards (including the Excellence Award), the Living Legend Award by &quot;Billboard Latin&quot; Women in Music; as well as awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life==
María Guadalupe Araujo Yong was born in Guamúchil, Sinaloa, Mexico on December 10, 1955. She did not receive formal training for singing and she credits her maternal grandfather Roberto Yong, an immigrant from China, for providing the only singing coaching she received.

She first sang on the stage at age six, singing &quot;Regalo A Dios&quot; by José Alfredo Jiménez. She moved to Tijuana, Baja California and studied accounting. At age 21, in 1977, she recorded her first song, titled &quot;Compréndeme&quot;.

==Career==
In 1987, Ana Gabriel won third place at the OTI Festival, celebrated in Lisbon, Portugal, where she performed an orchestral version of the pop-power ballad song &quot;Ay Amor&quot;, which later was released as a single in its album version; it climbed to the top position in Mexico, throughout Ibero-America and on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart for 14 consecutive weeks. 
In 1988 Gabriel released her third album, &quot;Pecado Original&quot;, followed by &quot;Tierra de Nadie&quot; in 1989, which met with some chart success. Her 1990 album &quot;Quién Como Tú&quot; made her a force within the Mexican music industry. Eight months later, her live album &quot;En Vivo&quot; showcased her powerful stage act and scored several hits: &quot;Hice Bien Quererte&quot;, &quot;Propuesta&quot;, and &quot;Solamente una Vez&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s Gabriel released an album almost every year. A versatile singer, she showcased her talent as an interpreter of many different musical styles, from lambada to mariachi and romantic ballads to pop music. She also honed her skills as a songwriter and a producer, releasing &quot;Mi México&quot;, a ranchera-influenced, mariachi-backed pop album, in 1991. This unique blend of styles was also reflected in the songs, all written by Gabriel. Her lyrics described strong, active women involved in their love lives, counter to their passive, traditional depiction in older songs. The album also included a tribute to Mexico&#x27;s most popular singer-songwriter, Juan Gabriel (no relation).

Gabriel scored a number-one hit with the duet &quot;Cosas del Amor&quot; in 1991, which she sang with Vikki Carr, a Mexican-American pop singer. The single earned Gabriel a Lo Nuestro Award for Song of the Year in 1992. At the same awards ceremony, Gabriel was also named Female Artist of the Year in the Regional Mexican category and Pop Female Artist of the Year; &quot;Mi México&quot; was named Regional Mexican Album of the Year. In 1993, Gabriel was awarded Best Pop Female Performer at the Lo Nuestro Awards. The following year, she appeared as a guest artist on Plácido Domingo&#x27;s Grammy-nominated album, &quot;De Mi Alma Latina&quot;.

In 1996 she released the pop-oriented &quot;Vivencias&quot;. She followed this with the traditional ranchera album &quot;Con un Mismo Corazón&quot; in 1997, an album she wrote and produced herself. Of particular interest is her title-track duet with Vicente Fernández, one of the most prolific and popular ranchera singers in Mexican history. Burr wrote of the duet, &quot;The beauty here lies in the melding of two great voices—Gabriel&#x27;s husky sensuality and Fernandez&#x27;s powerful, understated expressions—set against a 25-piece symphony.&quot;
Gabriel released another live album in 1998, &quot;En la Plaza de Toros México&quot;, a 30-track boxed set. That same year she traveled to Miami to work with the producer Emilio Estefan, Jr., on her 1999 album &quot;Soy Como Soy&quot;. The result was a pop-influenced ranchera album that went gold in the Latin music market and helped Gabriel win the Ritmo Latino Music Award for Female Pop Artist of the Year in 2000.

With the release of &quot;Eternamente&quot; in 2000, Gabriel returned to mariachi love ballads, using only guitar as accompaniment. That same year she also appeared with other Mexican music icons in an Independence Day television special called &quot;Viva Mexico&quot;, a celebration of Mexican music and history. In 2001 Gabriel released &quot;Huelo a Soledad&quot;, once again balancing the traditional sounds of Eternamente with sophisticated pop songs, a cappella numbers, and dance tracks.

In 2002, Gabriel&#x27;s platinum-selling album &quot;Sagitario&quot; was released. In that same year, she won the Billboard Latin Music Estrella Award in recognition of her contribution to the Latin music industry, performed at a tribute concert for Vicente Fernandez sponsored by the Latin Music Awards, and participated in the ninth annual Las Cruces International Mariachi Concert and Festival in New Mexico. In December of that year, she was scheduled to perform at the eleventh annual Christmas Mariachi Festival in Phoenix, Arizona, but was denied a work visa and refused entry into the United States.

In December 2014, singer Ana Gabriel told reporters on TV Azteca&#x27;s Ventaneando program that in 2015 she would release her new recording project after seven years without releasing an album with unreleased songs. She performed at the 2014 Viña del Mar Festival, receiving the award for most popular artist along with the Golden and Silver Seagull and Torch awards. In 2015, she received the Legend Award at the Hispanic Heritage Awards. Two years later, she was inducted into the Latin American Songwriters Hall Of Fame.

In 2017, Gabriel appeared in the multi award-winning documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. In the film, Gabriel recorded live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. She performed Lydia Mendoza&#x27;s &quot;Mal Hombre&quot; accompanied by a large band featuring Omar Rodríguez-López and Van Dyke Parks. Stephen Dalton in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described her performance as &quot;fantastic&quot;.

==Personal life==

Gabriel identifies as asexual.

<text>The Principal Galaxies Catalogue (PGC) is an astronomical catalog published in 1989 that lists B1950 and J2000 equatorial coordinates and cross-identifications for 73,197 galaxies. It is based on the Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic Database (LEDA), which was originally started in 1983. 40,932 coordinates (56%) have standard deviations smaller than . A total of 131,601 names from the 38 most common sources are listed. Available mean data for each object are given:

* 49,102 morphological descriptions,
* 52,954 apparent major and minor axis,
* 67,116 apparent magnitudes,
* 20,046 radial velocities and
* 24,361 position angles.

The Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic Database was eventually expanded into HyperLEDA, a database of a few million galaxies. Galaxies in the original PGC catalogue are numbered with their original PGC number in HyperLEDA. Numbers have also been assigned for the other galaxies, although for those galaxies not in the original PGC catalogue, it is not recommended to use that number as a name.

==Examples==

===PGC 39058===
PGC 39058 is a dwarf galaxy which is located approximately 14 million light-years away in the constellation of Draco. It is relatively nearby, however it is obscured by HD 106381, which is in front of the galaxy.

===PGC 6240===
PGC 6240 (also known as White Rose Galaxy) is a large lenticular galaxy in the constellation Hydrus. It is located about 346 million light-years away from Earth.

<doc id="992706" wikidata="Q16963482" url="?curid=992706" title="Endowment (philosophy)">
<text>Endowment is a concept in philosophy that refers to human capacities and abilities which can be naturally or socially acquired. Natural endowment is biologically analysed. It is examined through individual genes or inborn abilities. Social endowment is explored through the culture and ethics of human lives in their communities.

Natural and social endowment can be used to explain the behaviour of individuals. This natural and social distinction exemplifies individuals&#x27; positions within communities. The differences in human capacities enables diverse perceptions towards a similar situation. This includes Stephen Covey&#x27;s human endowments, which are self-awareness, imagination, willpower, abundance mentality, courage, creativity, and self-renewal.

The philosophical studies of human nature or endowment is outlined in the theories of medieval philosophers on human evolution such as; Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Aristotle, and Baruch Spinoza.

==Description==
Endowment in philosophical terms encompasses human innate and acquired capacities. The disciplinary focus of philosophy on human capacities is inclusive in the ontological studies of human nature. The innate and learned human capacities reflects the intrinsic lives and realities of human beings .

Endowment, either innate or acquired, varies among individuals and societies. Each individual consists of their own body and mind from birth until they become socially incorporated in communities where culture is learned and communal living is inevitable. This enables people to live together despite their different set of innate capacities. The necessity of living together as groups in order to thrive is part of individuals&#x27; acquired capacities.

The epistemological nature of human endowment can be explored through the state of nature theory with the focus on self-interested individuals and the creation of states. Human endowment is also inclusive in the theories of human nature exploring individuals&#x27; rational and social behaviours.
==History==

In-depth analysis of human endowment is attributed to theories and perceptions of human evolution.

The biological and cultural evolution is an ongoing process that shapes similarities and distinctive human attributes. Biological and cultural evolution coexist to influence human activities. Biological evolution is determined by genes or hereditary, which naturally gives individuals the ability to speak the language of their associated communities. Cultural evolution is the process where beliefs and a community&#x27;s way of living is passed down to generations which includes their spoken language.

The state of nature by Rousseau offers an understanding of self-preservation as the main innate human capacity. Natural human endowment is peoples&#x27; willingness to survive and enjoy life. This allows the existence of states which individuals have formulated in order to live peacefully and ensure their continual survival.
Aristotle&#x27;s human nature focuses on rationality as an innate human capacity that enables them to form communities and states. Aristotle shows the natural existence of communities and states due to individuals&#x27; innate capacities to live together. Living in communities reflects the differences between humans&#x27; innate abilities. This includes the innate abilities towards political participation between male and female.

Human endowment is considered to be of divine nature according to Spinoza. Divine nature is reference to God&#x27;s influence on human actions. The natural capacities of people to realise what they need enables them to make reasonable decisions and act accordingly. Spinoza&#x27;s idea of necessity as part of human endowment is connected to God or nature which is the only existing substance. 

Stephen Covey&#x27;s human endowment is divided into primary and secondary categories. Primary endowment includes; self-awareness, imagination, conscience, volition or will power. Secondary endowments are; abundance mentality, courage and consideration, creativity, and self-renewal. These endowments are explored through the stages of human life which are dependence, independence, and interdependence. Covey&#x27;s list of human endowment distinguishes between principles and values. Principles are external natural laws that determines the consequences of individual behaviour caused by their internal values. Principles are attributes of acquired or learned human endowment while values are of innate human capacities.

== Natural endowment ==
Endowment in the natural category refers to innate capacities of human beings which they are born with.

Humans&#x27; instinct nature to preserve themselves is considered a natural endowment under Rousseau&#x27;s state of nature theory. Individuals without having to acquire any instinctual value have the ability of wanting security to ensure their survival. The natural capacities of individuals to thrive and survive stems unilaterally from human mind rather than a polity. Natural endowment includes individuals&#x27; natural rights that allow humans&#x27; to be rational without any form of law in place. This differentiates natural endowment from social endowment.

Aristotle focuses on reason and mind as part of human natural endowment. Individuals are born with the natural ability to think, which enables them to make rational decisions. Individuals, through their minds and reason, develop abilities which could become habits if they continue to be rational. Aristotle&#x27;s political perceptions of human nature reflect the idea of unequal natural abilities between genders. This is due to the level of authority individuals have in expressing their innate cognitive faculties.

Baruch Spinoza builds on individuals&#x27; natural impulses as innate capacities which is from the recognition of what is necessary and nature itself. Humans natural capacities include the innate ability to realise what is necessary and act through reasoning and make decisions. This stems from humans&#x27; dependency as part of their innate capacities which cannot be separated from nature or God. The social construction of communities and states is a result of individuals&#x27; realisation that living together in a civilised manner is necessary for survival.

Stephen Covey&#x27;s primary endowment includes; self-awareness or self-conscious and imagination as part of humans&#x27; natural endowment. Self-awareness or self-conscious is the innate capacity of human beings to be more sensitive of their environment with what they encounter and experience. Individuals&#x27; have the natural ability to act reasonably towards certain situations as they know what the situation is and its consequences. Imagination is of individual minds where thoughts beyond real life occurrences and situations take place. Individuals make sense of their environment and world through their natural ability to imagine beyond reality.

==Social endowment==

Human endowment is social when they are acquired or learned from an environment. These learned characteristics varies between individuals and societies.

Social endowment includes conscience as part of individuals&#x27; learned ability to distinguish between what is right and wrong. This moral decision is a reflection of rules and laws in place to govern a certain group people or society. Individuals develop conscience from their cultures or the way of life within their communities. This differentiates peoples&#x27; reactions to certain situations they encounter and experience. The uneven structures and material distribution of goods and services within societies determines individuals&#x27; conscience. Individuals who are most vulnerable and make up most of the lower class in society develop a more self-motivated and determined conscience. This social endowment is a reflection of individuals&#x27; environment and their corresponding response to it.

Social endowment emerges from these communal societies with embedded rules that govern people. The set of rules in place is a result of social endowment where individuals distinguishes between acceptable and inappropriate behaviour.

The theory of human nature by Aristotle includes the philosophy of both natural and social human endowment. Social endowment flows from the natural capacities of people like their ability to think and make rational decisions. The gathering of communities and establishing of states are a result of rational decisions people make. This reflects the idea that humans are rational social and political animals. Individuals&#x27; social ability to think and make moral decisions allows them to live together in a polity. Living in a polity requires individuals to follow certain rules and way of life which becomes part of their social endowment. Sanctions are in place to correspond governing rules and ensure the maintenance of the polity.

<text>The Tibetan sandgrouse (Syrrhaptes tibetanus) is a large bird in the sandgrouse family. The genus name &quot;Syrrhaptes&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;surrhaptos&quot;, &quot;sewn together&quot; (the feathered toes of this sandgrouse are fused together) and &quot;tibetanus&quot; is from the type locality, Tibet.

== Description ==
The Tibetan sandgrouse is about 30–41 cm long, with a small, pigeon-like head and neck, but sturdy compact body. It has long pointed wings and pin tail. It has an orange face, finely barred grey breast, neck and crown, white belly and black underwings. Male has unspotted buff wing while the female has barred wing coverts, upperparts and upper belly than the male. Juvenile lacks the tail pin, has narrower barrings and has less orange on the face. White belly and dark underwings are distinctions from the related Pallas&#x27;s sandgrouse, with which its range overlaps. As with that species, its small feet lack a hind toe, and the three front toes are fused together. The upper surface is feathered, and the underneath has a fleshy pad. The appearance of the foot is more like a paw than an avian foot. 
== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Currently considered monotypic. Birds from the Pamirs were earlier separated as race &quot;pamirensis&quot;. The species was first described by Gould in 1850 based on specimen from Tso-Morriri in Ladakh.

== Distribution and status ==
Tibetan sandgrouse is found in mountains ranges of Central Asia, Tibet, Central China and the Himalayas. Though the population is decreasing, due to the large range and low rate of population decrease, the species is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by IUCN.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Tibetan sandgrouse is found on barren sandy plains near water. They are gregarious and form loose flocks. Their flight is fast and direct and on the wings, a clanging double note is uttered repeatedly. Flocks fly noisily to watering holes at dawn and dusk, usually the former, though less regular than other sandgrouse. They forage in the morning and afternoon on the undulating semi-desert plains. While foraging, their movements are fast and rapid. During the middle of the day it squats in a small depression in the ground, basking in the sun. They are generally not wary, especially in the middle of the day during resting.

This species breeds from May to June on the arid stony plateau and ridges, the nest site generally chosen near the top of the ridge on the leeward side. Its nest is a ground scrape in which three pale brown elliptical eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Generally the nest is exposed, though occasionally could be protected by a stone or grass. The young ones are able to move around soon after hatching. They move around with the flock. When threatened, adults resort to distraction displays, while the chicks crouch and freeze.

They feed on seeds, grass, buds and legumes.

<text>Jan Zábrana (4 July 1931 in Herálec – 3 September 1984 in Prague) was a Czech writer and translator.

His parents were teachers and politicians persecuted by the communist regime after the communist revolution of 1948: his mother, a member of the regional parliament, was arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison; his father, mayor of Humpolec before the communist coup, was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. All property of the Zábrana family was confiscated when Zábrana was nineteen. University studies were prohibited to non-communists, so he tried to study in a Catholic school for priests, but this was prohibited, also.

From 1952 to 1953, Zábrana worked in the Tatra Smíchov tram factory in Prague, and the following year in an enamel factory in Radotín, and wrote poems and short stories (published after the fall of the communist regime in 1989 in the book &quot;Sedm povídek&quot;). At this time he met many writers, both his elders (Vladimír Holan, Jiří Kolář) and his peers Václav Havel, Josef Škvorecký, Bohumil Hrabal). From 1954, he worked full-time as a translator and became one of the best Czech translators of 20th century. His interest focused mainly on Russian and American literature, including Aksjonov, Ivan Bunin, Cvetajeva, Mandelstam, Pasternak, Babel, and Platonov; and Allen Ginsberg, Graham Greene, Sylvia Plath, Wallace Stevens, Ferlinghetti, Ezra Pound, and Gregory Corso.

Zábrana also wrote many afterwords to his translations and these were published in &quot;Potkat básníka&quot; in 1989. Apart from three years during the 1960s when he published three collections (&#x27; 1965,&#x27; 1968 and &#x27; 1968), he published no original poetry in his lifetime. He wrote three detective stories (with [[Josef Skvorecky|Josef Škvorecký]]), and one novel for children. In the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]] period of the 1970s, later in the 1980s, he wrote poetry and continued with his diaries, published in 1992 under the title&#x27; (A Whole Life).

<text>The Casanovas are an Australian hard rock band, which formed in 1999 by Patrick Boyce on drums, his brother Tommy on lead vocals and lead guitar, and Jimmy Lewis on bass guitar. They have released an EP &quot;Keep It Hot&quot; (2002), and five albums, &quot;The Casanovas&quot; (2004), &quot;All Night Long&quot; (2006), &quot;Terra Casanova&quot; (2015), &quot;Reptilian Overlords&quot; (2020) and &quot;Backseat Rhythms&quot; (2023).

== History ==
The Casanovas were formed in late 1999 in Melbourne as a hard rock trio by brothers Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Boyce on drums and Tommy Boyce (a.k.a. Tommy Love) on lead vocals and lead guitar, with Jimmy Lewis on bass guitar. They released their debut single, &quot;10 Outta 10&quot;, in August 2000. They added another guitarist, James Saunders shortly after. Their first extended play, &quot;Keep It Hot&quot; was released in September 2002. During 2002 Saunders left and Lewis was replaced on bass by Damian &quot;Damo&quot; Campbell.

Starting in December 2002 they toured Australia, United Kingdom and supported New Zealand group, the Datsuns, for their European tour. This was followed by five dates in the United States in March 2003. Their single, &quot;Shake It&quot;, received considerable Triple J airplay. Carly Sticpewich of &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; described it as &quot;hip-shaking rock turned up to 11 that you can get drunk to while you figure out how you&#x27;re going to become as cool as singer/guitarist Tommy Love. Which, of course, is impossible because rock stars as cool as this are damn hard to imitate. Eat your heart out.&quot;

They toured with the Datsuns, again, in October 2003 to New Zealand. They followed by two more Australian tours; one with the Living End in November–December. In December 2003 Paddy Boyce left the group and was replaced on drums by Jordan &quot;Jaws&quot; Stanley (ex-the Onyas) in the following January. Campbell explained &quot;It was long time coming and everyone is still on good relations but Paddy just wanted to go and do other projects... We had to train [Stanley] up nice and quick. His first two shows were in Sydney with the Darkness and then The Big Day Out. That&#x27;s putting the pressure on.&quot;

They followed by another tour in early 2004 with Starky and the Specimens. Their debut self-titled album, was released in May 2004. &quot;Oz Music Project&quot;″s Tim Coyle felt they &quot;have been cruising on the groundswell of enthusiasm for four-square beats and power chord + clever-dick-solo guitar pyrotechnics, providing their rock mission statement.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia observed that they &quot;not only succeed at pulling off mirror-image AC/DC blues bombers like &#x27;Livin&#x27; in the City&#x27;, &#x27;Shake It&#x27;, and evergreen first single, &#x27;10 Outta 10&#x27;, with remarkably little evident guilt; they also know how and when to step out of the box without embarrassing themselves.&quot; They went on to play some dates in New York City in July and then a tour of Japan in September 2004.

A second album, &quot;All Night Long&quot; was released in 2006, from which they have released two singles, &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;California&quot;. &quot;Born to Run&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of video game publisher EA Sports&#x27; title, &quot;Rugby 06&quot;, as well as being the main song for Melbourne-based video game developers IR Gurus&#x27; title, &quot;AFL Premiership 2006&quot;, whilst &quot;Shake It&quot; was used in three Videogames: &quot;F1 2011&quot; (Codemasters), &quot;WRC 4&quot; (Evolution Studios) and &quot;This is Football 2005&quot; (London Studio) .

Their third Album &quot;Terra Casanova&quot; was released in 2015, their fourth, &quot;Reptilian Overlord&quot;, in 2020, and their fifth &quot;Backseat Rhythms&quot; in August 2023.

<text>Syrrhaptes is a genus of birds in the sandgrouse family. The genus name is from Ancient Greek
&quot;surrhaptos&quot;, &quot;sewn together&quot;; the feathered toes of birds in this genus are fused together.

There are two central Asian species.



These are large birds breeding in open steppes or plateau. They nest in a ground scrape into which three eggs are laid.

Both species have mainly buff upperparts, an orange face and feathered legs and toes. They are smaller-headed than other sandgrouse, but have sturdy compact bodies.

The small feet lack a hind toe, and the three front toes are fused together. The upper surface is feathered, and the underneath has a fleshy pad. The appearance of the foot is more like a paw than an avian foot.

Although there is range overlap, they are easily distinguished. Tibetan sandgrouse has a white belly and black underwings, whereas Pallas&#x27;s has a black belly and white underwings.

These birds are gregarious like other sandgrouse. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk, on long pointed wings.

<text>Sagalassos (), also known as Selgessos () and Sagallesos (), is an archaeological site in southwestern Turkey, about 100 km north of Antalya (ancient Attaleia) and 30 km from Burdur and Isparta. The ancient ruins of Sagalassos are 7 km from Ağlasun (as well as being its namesake) in the province of Burdur, on Mount Akdağ, in the Western Taurus mountains range, at an altitude of 1450–1700 metres.
In Roman Imperial times, the town was known as the &quot;first city of Pisidia&quot;, a region in the western Taurus mountains, currently known as the Turkish Lakes Region. During the Hellenistic period it was already one of the major Pisidian towns.

==Introduction==
The urban site was laid out on various terraces at an altitude between 1400 and 1600 m. After suffering from a major earthquake in the early sixth century CE, the town managed to recover, but a cocktail of epidemics, water shortages, a general lack of security and stability, a failing economy and finally another devastating earthquake around the middle of the seventh century forced the inhabitants to abandon their town and resettle in the valley.

Large-scale excavations started in 1990 under the direction of Marc Waelkens of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. A large number of buildings, monuments and other archaeological remains have been exposed, documenting the monumental aspect of the Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine history of this town.

==History==

Human settlement in the area goes back to 8000 BCE, before the actual site was occupied. Hittite documents refer to a mountain site of &quot;Salawassa&quot; in the fourteenth century BCE and the town spread during the Phrygian and Lydian cultures. Sagalassos was part of the region of Pisidia in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions.

Sagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when Alexander the Great conquered it in 333 BCE on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander&#x27;s death, the region became part of the territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, the Seleucids of Syria and the Attalids of Pergamon. The archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenic culture.
The Roman Empire absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of the province of Asia. In 39 BCE it was handed out to Galatian client king Amyntas, but after he was killed in 25 BCE Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor Hadrian, who named it the &quot;first city&quot; of the province and the center of the imperial cult. Contemporary buildings have a fully Roman character.

Around 400 CE Sagalassos was fortified for defence. An earthquake devastated it in 518 and a plague circa 541–543 halved the local population. Arab raids threatened the town around 640 and after another earthquake destroyed the town in the middle of the seventh century, the site was abandoned. The populace probably resettled in the valley. Excavations have found only signs of a fortified monastery—possibly a religious community, which was destroyed in the twelfth century. Sagalassos disappeared from the records.

In the following centuries, erosion covered the ruins of Sagalassos. It was not looted to a significant extent, possibly because of its location.

Explorer Paul Lucas, who was traveling in Turkey on a mission for the court of Louis XIV of France, visited the ruins in 1706. After 1824, when Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell (1780–1846), the British chaplain at Smyrna and an antiquarian, visited the site and deciphered its name in inscriptions, Western travelers began to visit the ruins. Polish historian of art, count K. Lanckoroński produced the first map of Sagalassos. However, the city did not attract much archaeological attention until 1985, when an Anglo-Belgian team led by Stephen Mitchell began a major survey of the site.

==Modern project==

From 1990 Sagalassos, a major tourist site, has become a major excavation project led by Marc Waelkens of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. The monumental city center is now exposed; four major restoration projects are (nearly) completed. The project also undertakes an intensive urban and geophysical survey, excavations in the domestic and industrial areas, and an intensive survey of the territory. The first survey documents a thousand years of occupation—from Alexander the Great to the seventh century—while the latter has established the changing settlement patterns, the vegetation history and farming practices, the landscape formation and climatic changes during the last 10,000 years.
On 9 August 2007, the press reported the discovery of a finely detailed, colossal statue of the Emperor Hadrian, which is thought to have stood 4–5m in height. The statue dates to the early part of Hadrian&#x27;s reign, and depicts the emperor in military garb. It was carved in sections that were fitted together with marble tenons on the site, which was a &quot;thermae&quot;, a public bath. A major earthquake sometime between the late sixth and early seventh centuries CE brought the vaulting crashing down; the statue was felled, coming apart along the joins of its facture. The discovery of carved marble toes drilled with dowel holes to fasten them to the hem of a long mantle suggests the possibility of finding a companion sculpture of Sabina, the emperor&#x27;s consort. On 14 August 2008, the head statue of Faustina the Elder, wife of Roman emperor Antoninus Pius (Hadrian&#x27;s successor and adopted son) was discovered in the same site. On 22 August 2008, another colossal portrait head was found, this time of Marcus Aurelius.

A study involving mitochondrial analysis of a Byzantine-era population, whose samples were gathered from excavations in the archaeological site of Sagalassos, found that Sagalassos samples were closest to modern samples from Greek / Balkan and Persian and Italy.&quot;

==Exhibitions==

<text>Jan Zahradníček (17 January 1905, Mastník, Moravia − 10 October 1960, Vlčatín) was a Moravian (Czech) poet, journalist and translator.

He was one of the most important Czech Catholic poets of the 20th century. Because of his faith and his anti-totalitarian work, he was imprisoned as an enemy of the Communist Party after the Communist coup of 1948.

==Biography==
From 1919 to 1926 he studied at Třebíč gymnasium. He then studied literature and comparative literature at the Charles University in Prague. Among his teachers were the literary critic František Xaver Šalda and the writer Václav Tille. In 1936 he moved to Uhřínov to translate and write poetry. From 1940 until 1948 he was the editor of &quot;Akord&quot; Revue in Brno. In 1945, he became the editor of Brněnské tiskárny (a publishing house).

In June 1951 he was arrested by the Communist secret police (StB) and sentenced to 13 years&#x27; imprisonment. In 1960 he was granted amnesty due to his worsening health. He died in the same year, in an ambulance while passing through the municipality of Vlčatín. He was buried in Uhřínov.

He had four children, two daughters died from mushroom poisoning in the time of his imprisonment.

<text>The Holkars (pronunciation: ) were the ruling house of the Indore State of the Maratha Confederacy, and earlier held the rank of Subahdar under Peshwa Baji Rao I. When the Maratha Confederacy began to weaken due to internal clashes, the Holkars declared themselves the rulers of Indore in Central India, existing as an autonomous member of the Maratha Confederacy until 1818. Later, their kingdom became a princely state under the British protection.

&quot;HH Maharanidhiraja Rani Rajeshwar Sawai Shrimant Akhand Soubbagyavati Usha Devi Holkar, 15th Maharani of Indore&quot; is the current titular head.

== Rise of Holkar as Subahdar==

The Holkars were of Gadariya -Dhangar origin.

Malhar Rao Holkar (1694–1766), a Maratha chief serving [chhatrapati shahu Maharaj Maratha Empire chhatrapati , established the dynasty&#x27;s rule over Indore. In the 1720s, he led Maratha armies in the Malwa region, and in 1733 was granted 9 parganas in the vicinity of Indore by the Maratha Empire. The township of Indore already existed as an independent principality established by Nandlal Mandloi of Kampel, Nandlal Mandloi was won by the Maratha force and allowed them to camp across the Khan River. In 1734, Malhar Rao established a camp later called Malharganj. In 1747, he began construction of his royal palace, the Rajwada. By the time of his death, he ruled much of Malwa, and was acknowledged as one of the five virtually independent rulers of the Maratha Empire.

He was succeeded by Ahilyabai Holkar (r. 1767–1795), his daughter-in-law. She was born in the Chaundi village in Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar, south of Indore on the Narmada River. &quot;Rani&quot; Ahilyabai was a prolific builder and patron of Hindu temples in Maheshwar and Indore. She also built temples at sacred sites outside her kingdom, from Dwarka in Gujarat east to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple at Varanasi on the Ganges.

The adopted son of Malhar Rao Holkar, Tukoji Rao Holkar (r. 1795–1797) briefly succeeded Rani Ahilyabai upon her death. Tukoji Rao had been a commander under Ahilyabai for her entire rule.

==The fall of the Maratha Empire==

His son Yashwantrao Holkar (r. 1797–1811) (also called as Jaswant Rao) succeeded Tukoji Rao Holkar upon his death. He tried to free the Delhi Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II from the British in the unsuccessful Second Anglo-Maratha War. The grateful Shah Alam gave him the title of &quot;Maharajadiraj Rajrajeshwar Alija Bahadur&quot; in honor of his bravery.
Attempts by Yashwantrao Holkar to unite the kings failed, and he was approached to sign a peace treaty with the British. The Treaty of Rajghat, signed late December 1805, recognised him as a sovereign king.

==Battle of Mahidpur==

In 1811, the four-year-old Malhar Rao Holkar III succeeded Yashwantrao Holkar. His mother, Tulsabai Holkar, looked after the administration. However, with the help of Pathans, Pindaris, and the British, Dharama Kunwar and Balaram Seth plotted to imprison Tulsabai and Malharrao. When Tulsabai learnt about this, she beheaded both of them in 1815 and appointed Tantia Jog. As a result, Gaffur Khan Pindari secretly signed a treaty with the British on 9 November 1817 and killed Tulsabai on 19 December 1817.

The treaty was signed on 6 January 1818 at Mandsaur. Bhimabai Holkar did not accept the treaty, and kept attacking the British by guerilla methods. Years later, in revolt of 1857, Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi took inspiration from Bhimabai Holkar and also fought against the British. At the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the Holkars lost much of their territory to the British and were incorporated into the British Raj as a princely state of the Central India Agency. The capital was shifted from Bhanpura to Indore.

==Princely state==

Malharrao Holkar III entered Indore on 2 November 1818. Tantia Jog was appointed his Diwan as he was a minor. As the old palace had been destroyed by the army of Daulat Rao Scindia, a new palace was constructed in its place. Malharrao III was succeeded by Marthand Rao Holkar, who formally ascended to the throne on 17 January 1834. He was replaced by Hari Rao Holkar, nephew of Yashwantrao, who ascended to the throne on 17 April 1834. He adopted Khande Rao Holkar II on 2 July 1841 and died on 24 October 1843. Khanderao was formally installed as the ruler on 13 November 1843, but he suddenly died on 17 February 1844. Tukojirao Holkar II (1835–1886) was installed on the throne on 27 June 1844. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he was loyal to the British East India Company. In October 1872, he appointed T. Madhava Rao as the &quot;Diwan&quot; of Indore. He died on 17 June 1886 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Shivajirao Holkar.

Yashwantrao Holkar II (reigned 1926–1948) ruled Indore state until shortly after India&#x27;s independence in 1947, when he acceded to the Union of India. Indore became a district of Madhya Bharat state, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh state in 1956.

<doc id="992782" wikidata="Q1479193" url="?curid=992782" title="Gender symbol">
<text>A gender symbol is a pictogram or glyph used to represent sex and gender, for example in biology and medicine, in genealogy, or in the sociological fields of gender politics, LGBT subculture and identity politics.

In his books (1767) and (1771), Carl Linnaeus regularly used the planetary symbols of Mars, Venus and Mercury, , for male, female and hermaphroditic (perfect) flowers, respectively. Botanists now use for the last.

In genealogy, including kinship in anthropology and pedigrees in animal husbandry, the geometric shapes or are used for male and for female. These are also used on public toilets in some countries. 

The modern international pictograms used to indicate male and female public toilets, and , became widely used in the 1960s and 1970s. They are sometimes abstracted to for male and for female.

==Biology and medicine==

The three standard sex symbols in biology are male , female and hermaphroditic ; originally the symbol for Mercury, , was used for the last. These symbols were first used by Carl Linnaeus in 1751 to denote whether flowers were male (stamens only), female (pistil only) or perfect flowers with both pistils and stamens. (Most flowering and conifer plant species are hermaphroditic and either bear flowers/cones that themselves are hermaphroditic, or bear both male and female flowers/cones on the same plant.) These symbols are now ubiquitous in biology and medicine to indicate the sex of an individual, for example of a patient.

==Genealogy==

Kinship charts use a triangle for male and circle for female. Pedigree charts published in scientific papers use an earlier anthropological convention of a square for male and a circle for female.

Before a shape distinction was adopted, all individuals had been represented by a circle in Morgan&#x27;s 1871 &quot;System of Consanguinity and Affinity of Human Family&quot;, where gender is encoded in the abbreviations for the kin relation (e.g. M for &#x27;mother&#x27; and F for &#x27;father&#x27;). W. H. R. Rivers distinguished gender in the words of the language being recorded by writing male kinship terms in all capitals and female kinship terms with normal capitalization. That convention was quite influential for a time, and his convention of prioritizing male kin by placing them to the left and females to the right continues to this day though there have been exceptions, such as Margaret Mead, who placed females to the left.

==Public toilets==

The modern gender symbols used for public toilets, for male and for female, are pictograms created for the British Rail system in the mid-1960s. Before that, local usage had been more variable. For example, schoolhouse outhouses in the 19th-century United States had ventilation holes in their doors that were shaped like a starburst Sun or like a crescent Moon , respectively, to indicate whether the toilet was for use by boys or girls. The British Rail pictogramsoften color-coded blue and redare now the norm for marking public toilets in much of the world, with the female symbol distinguished by a triangular skirt or dress, and in early years (and sometimes still) the male symbol stylized like a tuxedo.

These symbols are abstracted to varying degrees in different countriesfor example, the circle-and-triangle variants (male) and (female) commonly found on portable toilets, sometimes abstracted further to a triangle (representing a skirt or dress) for female and an inverted triangle (representing a broad-shouldered tuxedo) for male in Lithuania.

In elementary schools, the pictograms may be of children rather than of adults, with the girl distinguished by her hair. In themed locations, such as bars and tourist attractions, a thematic image or figurine of a man and woman or boy and girl may be used.

In Poland, an inverted triangle is used for male while a circle is used for female. 

In mainland China, silhouettes of heads in profile may be used as gender pictograms, generally alongside the Chinese characters for male () and female ().

Some contemporary designs for restroom signage in public spaces are shifting away from symbols that demonstrate gender as binary as a way to be more inclusive.

==Sexual orientation and gender politics==

Since the 1970s, variations of gender symbols have been used to express sexual orientation and gender politics. Two interlocking male symbols (⚣) are used to represent gay men while two interlocking female symbols (⚢) are often used to represent lesbians. Two female and two male symbols interlocked represent bisexuality, while an interlocked female and male symbol (⚤) represents heterosexuality.

The combined male-female symbol (⚥) is used to represent androgyne people; when additionally combined with the female (♀) and male (♂) symbols (⚧) it indicates gender inclusivity, though it is also used as a transgender symbol. The male-with-stroke symbol (⚦) is used for transgender people.

The Mercury symbol (☿) and combined female/male symbol (⚥) have both been used to represent intersex people. A featureless circle (⚪︎), neuter symbol (⚲), and the alchemical symbol for sublimate of antimony (🜬) are used to represent both asexuality and non-binary people.

Since the 2000s, numerous variants of gender symbols have been introduced in the context of LGBT culture and politics. Some of these symbols have been adopted into Unicode (in the Miscellaneous Symbols block) beginning with version 4.1 in 2005.

<text>Mehdi Hassan Khan (; 18 July 1927 – 13 June 2012), known as Mehdi Hassan, was a Pakistani ghazal singer and playback singer of great renown. Widely considered one of the greatest and most influential figures in the history of ghazal singing, Hassan is referred to as the &quot;Shahenshah-e-Ghazal&quot; (, &quot;Emperor of Ghazal&quot;). Known for his &quot;haunting&quot; baritone voice, Hassan is credited with bringing ghazal singing to a worldwide audience. He is unique for his melodic patterns and maintaining integrity of the ragas in an innovative way.

Born into a family of Kalawant musicians, Hassan was naturally inclined towards music from a young age. He influenced generations of singers from diverse genres, from Jagjit Singh to Parvez Mehdi. He earned numerous awards and accolades during his lifetime and remained a leading singer of Pakistani film industry, along with contemporary playback singer Ahmed Rushdi; it is estimated that Hassan sang for over 300 films during his career. For his contributions to the arts, Hassan was awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, Pride of Performance, and Hilal-e-Imtiaz by the Government of Pakistan.

== Early life ==
Hassan was born on 18 July 1927 in the village of Luna, then located in the Jaipur State of the Rajputana Agency in British India but now in the Indian state of Rajasthan, into a family of traditional musicians. He claims to be the 16th generation of hereditary musicians hailing from the Kalawant clan of musicians. Hassan started training in classical music at the age of eight and completed his musical training with his father Ustad Azeem Khan and uncle Ustad Ismail Khan who were both traditional Dhrupad singers. Hassan started performing at a young age and by the time he was 18 years old, Hassan is said to have mastered the classical singing forms of dhrupad, dadra, thumri, and khayal, and started performing at royal courts with his brother Ghulam Qadir. Hassan started his career primarily as a thumri exponent. His first concert of dhrupad and khayal with his elder brother is reported to have been held in Fazilka Bungla, near present DC House (1935) of Undivided Punjab. His elder brother Ustad Ghulam Qadir also was instrumental in sharpening his skills. 

After the partition of India in 1947, the 20-year-old Hassan and his family migrated to Pakistan, carrying little with them by way of material belongings. The family proceeded to his paternal aunt&#x27;s house who lived in a village, Chak No 111/7R, near Chichawatni. They suffered severe financial hardships in their new country. Hassan initially started working in nearby Chichawatni, in a bicycle shop Mughal Cycle House and later became a car and diesel tractor mechanic. Despite the financial hardships, he kept up his singing practice on a daily basis.

== Singing career ==
In 1957, Hassan was again given the opportunity to sing on Radio Pakistan, primarily as a thumri singer and later as a ghazal performer, which earned him recognition within the musical fraternity. He had a passion for Urdu poetry, and therefore, he began to experiment by singing &quot;ghazals&quot; on a part-time basis. He cites radio officers Z.A. Bukhari and Rafiq Anwar as additional influences in his progression as a &quot;ghazal&quot; singer. He first sang on Radio Pakistan in 1952. His first film song was &quot;Nazar Milte Hi Dil Ki Bat Ka Charcha Na Ho Jaye&quot; film &quot;Shikhar&quot; in 1956. This song was written by poet Yazdani Jalandhari and its music was composed by Asghar Ali M. Husain. In 1964, his ghazal for a film &quot;Farangi&quot;, &quot;Gulon mein rang bharay, baad-e-naubahar chale&quot; written by renowned Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz and composed by Rasheed Attre, gave him a major breakthrough into the Pakistani film industry and he never looked back after that. Even the original ghazal poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz stopped reciting it in his &#x27;mushairas&#x27; (poetry reciting events) and, instead, recommended that the audience ask Hassan to sing it for them because the poet jokingly used to say that the ghazal belonged to Hassan after its popularity.

In October 2010, HMV Label released &quot;Sarhadein&quot; in which his first and last duet song &quot;Tera Milna&quot; featuring Hassan and Lata Mangeshkar was released. This song was composed by Hassan and written by Farhat Shahzad. Hassan recorded it in Pakistan in 2009, and Mangeshkar later heard the track and recorded her part in India in 2010, and the song was later mixed for a duet. The same duet was also sung by Hassan and Noor Jehan.

Following a severe illness in the late 1980s, Hassan cut back on his singing, eventually stepping down from playback singing altogether. Later, due to the severity of his illness, he completely departed from music.

==Death==
Hassan suffered from a serious chronic lung condition for a few years before his death. He also received treatment for lung, urinary tract, and chest ailments at several hospitals in Pakistan for about 12 years prior to his death. Towards the end of 2000, he suffered his first stroke while in Kerala, India. In 2005, he was taken to India for ayurvedic treatment where he was welcomed by A.B. Vajpayee, Dilip Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and many of his Indian fans. He suffered his second stroke soon after he returned from India which left him with speech impairments and limited his physical mobility. Hassan developed a severe chest infection and breathing difficulties in the days preceding his death. He died of multiple organ failure on 13 June 2012 at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi.

==Tributes==
Hassan is widely regarded as one of the greatest singers in the sub-continent and is said to have revolutionized the way &quot;ghazals&quot; were sung. In 1977, Indian playback singer Lata Mangeshkar was so moved by his dulcet vocals during a New Delhi concert that she reportedly said, &quot;Aisa lagta hai ke unke gale mein bhagwan boltein hain&quot; (it seems as though like God is singing through his voice). On 18 July 2018, the day of his 91st birthday, Google featured Hassan on its homepage doodle. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid tribute to Hassan, calling him &quot;an icon who mesmerized music lovers&quot; for decades. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stated that Hassan &quot;brought the sub-continental Sufi sensibilities to life through his songs,&quot; and that &quot;the influence of his passion for Urdu poetry and initial grooming in Dhrupad tradition earned for him a special place in the world of music.&quot;

<text>Mallotus is a genus of the spurge family Euphorbiaceae first described as a genus in 1790. Two species (&quot;M. oppositifolius&quot; and &quot;M. subulatus&quot;) are found in tropical Africa and Madagascar, while all others are found in East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, eastern Australia, and certain islands of the western Pacific. The genus has about 150 species of dioecious trees or shrubs.

==Fossil record==
&quot;Mallotus&quot; macrofossils have been recovered from the late Zanclean stage of Pliocene sites in Pocapaglia, Italy.

==Uses==
&quot;Mallotus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;. The Kamala tree (&quot;Mallotus philippensis&quot;) has seed capsules which are the source of a yellow dye (Kamala dye) and were formerly a herbal remedy.

<doc id="992789" wikidata="Q134657" url="?curid=992789" title="Rhinoceros (genus)">
<text>Rhinoceros is a genus comprising one-horned rhinoceroses. This scientific name was proposed by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus contains two species, the Indian rhinoceros (&quot;Rhinoceros unicornis&quot;) and the Javan rhinoceros (&quot;Rhinoceros sondaicus&quot;). Although both members are threatened, the Javan rhinoceros is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world with only 60 individuals surviving in Java (Indonesia). The word &#x27;rhinoceros&#x27; is of Greek origin meaning &quot;nose-horn&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The genus name &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; is a combination of the ancient Greek words ῥίς (rhis) meaning &#x27;nose&#x27; and κέρας (keras) meaning &#x27;horn of an animal&#x27;.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; comprises:
*Indian rhinoceros (&quot;R. unicornis&quot;) Indian subcontinent
*Javan rhinoceros (&quot;R. sondaicus&quot;) Southeast Asia
*†&quot;R. sivalensis&quot; northern Indian subcontinent (Siwalik Hills) Pliocene-Early Pleistocene
*†&quot;R. platyrhinus&quot; syn &quot;Punjabitherium&quot; Upper Siwaliks, Indian subcontinent, Early Pleistocene to early Middle Pleistocene, India. Largest species in the genus.
*†&quot;R. sinensis&quot; Has been used as a wastebasket taxon used to refer to rhinoceros material from the Pleistocene of China, with various specimens belong to other &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; species, &quot;Dicerorhinus&quot; and &quot;Stephanorhinus,&quot; though it is possible that some remains attributed to &quot;Rhinoceros sinensis&quot; represents a valid and distinct species of &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;.
The earliest remains of the genus are known from the Late Miocene, represented by remains such as an indeterminate species found in deposits in Myanmar dating to around 8-9 million years ago.

The species &quot;&quot;Rhinoceros&quot; philippinensis&quot; from the early Middle Pleistocene of the Philippines and &quot;&quot;Rhinoceros&quot; sinensis hayasakai&quot; from the Early-Middle Pleistocene of Taiwan have been transferred to &quot;Nesorhinus,&quot; which appears to be closely related to &quot;Rhinoceros.&quot; While &quot;Rhinoceros fusuiensis&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of South China has been transferred to &quot;Dicerorhinus.&quot;

<doc id="992796" wikidata="Q864296" url="?curid=992796" title="Pituitary adenoma">
<text>Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.

Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.

Adenomas exceeding in size are defined as &quot;macroadenomas&quot;, while those smaller than are referred to as &quot;microadenomas&quot;. Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas and have an estimated prevalence of 16.7% (14.4% in autopsy studies and 22.5% in radiologic studies). The majority of pituitary microadenomas remain undiagnosed, and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding and are referred to as &quot;incidentalomas&quot;.

Pituitary macroadenomas are the most common cause of hypopituitarism.

While pituitary adenomas are common, affecting approximately 1 in 6 members of the general population, clinically active pituitary adenomas that require surgical treatment are more rare, affecting approximately 1 in 1,000.
==Signs and symptoms==

===Physical===
Hormone secreting pituitary adenomas cause one of several forms of hyperpituitarism. The specifics depend on the type of hormone. Some tumors secrete more than one hormone, the most common combination being GH and prolactin, which present as gigantism or acromegaly and unexpected lactation (in both men and women).

A patient with pituitary adenoma may present with visual field defects, classically on the left and right in bitemporal hemianopsia. It arises from the compression of the optic nerve by the tumor. The specific area of the visual pathway at which compression by these tumours occurs is at the optic chiasm. If originating superior to the optic chiasm, more commonly in a craniopharyngioma of the pituitary stalk, the visual field defect will first appear as bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia. If originating inferior to the optic chiasm the visual field defect will first appear as bitemporal superior quadrantanopia. Lateral expansion of a pituitary adenoma can also compress the abducens nerve, causing a lateral rectus palsy.

Also, a pituitary adenoma can cause symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Prolactinomas often start to give symptoms especially during pregnancy, when the increased hormone level estrogen can increase the tumor&#x27;s growth rate.

Various types of headaches are common in patients with pituitary adenomas. The adenoma may be the prime causative factor behind the headache or may serve to exacerbate a headache caused by other factors. Amongst the types of headaches experienced are both chronic and episodic migraine, and more uncommonly various unilateral headaches; primary stabbing headache, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) – another type of stabbing headache characterized by short stabs of pain – cluster headache, and hemicrania continua (HS).

Compressive symptoms of pituitary adenomas (visual field deficits, decreased visual acuity, headaches) are more commonly seen with macroadenomas (which are greater than 10 mm in diameter) than with microadenomas (which are less than 10 mm in diameter).

Non-secreting adenomas can go undetected for an extended time because no obvious abnormalities are seen; the gradual reduction in normal activities due to decreased production of hormones is rather less evident. For example, insufficient adrenocorticotropic hormone means that the adrenal glands will not produce sufficient cortisol, resulting in slow recovery from illness, inflammation, and chronic fatigue; insufficient growth hormone in children and adolescents leads to diminished stature but which can have many other explanations.

===Psychiatric===
Various psychiatric manifestations have been associated with pituitary disorders including pituitary adenomas. Psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety apathy, emotional instability, easy irritability and hostility have been noted.

===Complications===

* Acromegaly is a syndrome that results when the anterior pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone (GH). Approximately 90–95% of acromegaly cases are caused by a pituitary adenoma and it most commonly affects middle aged adults, Acromegly can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and premature death if unchecked. The disease which is often also associated with gigantism, is difficult to diagnose in the early stages and is frequently missed for many years, until changes in external features, especially of the face, become noticeable with the median time from the development of initial symptoms to diagnosis being twelve years.
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is a hormonal disorder that causes hypercortisolism, which is elevated levels of cortisol in the blood. Cushing&#x27;s disease (CD) is the most frequent cause of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, responsible for approximately 70% of cases. CD results when a pituitary adenoma causes excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive amounts of cortisol.

:Cushing&#x27;s disease may cause fatigue, weight gain, fatty deposits around the abdomen and lower back (truncal obesity) and face (&quot;moon face&quot;), stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts, and arms, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and various infections. In women, it may cause excessive growth of facial hair (hirsutism) and in men erectile dysfunction. Psychiatric manifestations may include depression, anxiety, easy irritability, and emotional instability. It may also result in various cognitive difficulties.
* Hyperpituitarism is a disease of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland which is usually caused by a functional pituitary adenoma and results in hypersecretion of adenohypophyseal hormones such as growth hormone; prolactin; thyrotropin; luteinizing hormone; follicle-stimulating hormone; and adrenocorticotropic hormone.
* Pituitary apoplexy is a condition that occurs when pituitary adenomas suddenly hemorrhage internally, causing a rapid increase in size or when the tumor outgrows its blood supply which causes tissue necrosis and subsequent swelling of the dead tissue. Pituitary apoplexy often presents with visual loss and sudden onset headache and requires timely treatment often with corticosteroids and if necessary surgical intervention.
* Central diabetes insipidus is caused by diminished production of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin that causes severe thirst and excessive production of very dilute urine (polyuria) which can lead to dehydration. Vasopressin is produced in the hypothalamus and is then transported down the pituitary stalk and stored in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland which then secretes it into the bloodstream.

As the pituitary gland is in close proximity to the brain, invasive adenomas may invade the dura mater, cranial bone, or sphenoid bone.

==Risk factors==

===Multiple endocrine neoplasia===
Adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland are a major clinical feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a rare inherited endocrine syndrome that affects 1 person in every 30,000. MEN causes various combinations of benign or malignant tumors in various glands in the endocrine system or may cause the glands to become enlarged without forming tumors. It often affects the parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. MEN1 may also cause non-endocrine tumors such as facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and leiomyomas. Approximately 25 percent of patients with MEN1 develop pituitary adenomas.

===Carney complex===
Carney complex (CNC), also known as LAMB syndrome and NAME syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition comprising myxomas of the heart and skin, hyperpigmentation of the skin (lentiginosis), and endocrine overactivity and is distinct from Carney&#x27;s triad. Approximately 7% of all cardiac myxomas are associated with Carney complex. Patients with CNC develop growth hormone (GH)-producing pituitary tumors and in some instances these same tumors also secrete prolactin. There are however no isolated prolactinomas or any other type of pituitary tumor. In some patients with CNC, the pituitary gland is characterized by hyperplastic areas with the hyperplasia most likely preceding the formation of GH-producing adenomas.

===Familial isolated pituitary adenoma===
Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) is a term that is used to identify a condition that displays an autosomal dominant inheritance and is characterised by the presence of two or more related patients affected by adenomas of the pituitary gland only, with no other associated symptoms that occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), Carney complex and with mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene. FIPA was first described in a limited cohort of families by Albert Beckers group in Liège, Belgium; later FIPA was fully characterized in a multicenter international study of 64 families. FIPA families are divided into those that are homogenous and have the same type of pituitary adenoma in all the affected family members (e.g. only acromegaly, only prolactinoma, etc.), while heterogeneous FIPA families can have different pituitary adenomas in affected family members.

==== Genetics of FIPA ====
FIPA has two known genetic causes, mutations in the AH receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene and duplications in chromosome Xq26.3 that include the &quot;GPR101&quot; gene that also causes X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG) syndrome. About 15–20% of FIPA families carry a germline &quot;AIP&quot; gene mutation or deletion, and the disease occurs as autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, meaning that about 20% of AIP mutation carriers will develop a pituitary adenoma. &quot;AIP&quot; mutation associated pituitary adenomas (either presenting as FIPA or as individual, non familial cases) are usually growth hormone-secreting (acromegaly) or prolactin-secreting (prolactinoma) adenomas that are large (macroadenomas) and often occur in children, adolescents and young adults. Daly and colleagues showed that acromegaly cases with &quot;AIP&quot; mutations occurred about 20 years before acromegaly cases without &quot;AIP&quot; mutations and these tumors are large and relatively treatment-resistant. Due to their young age at onset, &quot;AIP&quot; mutations are the most frequent genetic cause of pituitary gigantism (29% of cases).

X-LAG is a rare syndrome of very early childhood onset pituitary tumors/hyperplasia that leads to growth hormone excess and severe overgrowth and pituitary gigantism. Three FIPA families with X-LAG have been reported to date all of which had transmission of a chromosome Xq26.3 duplication from affected mother to affected son. The disease characteristics of very young onset pituitary gigantism leads to severe overgrowth if not treated adequately; many of the tallest humans in history (e.g. Robert Pershing Wadlow; Sandy Allen, André Rousimoff (Andre the Giant), Zeng Jinlian) had a similar clinical history to patients with X-LAG syndrome. The tallest historical individual with a known genetic cause was Julius Koch (Geant Constantin) who was found to have X-LAG on genetic study of his skeleton. X-LAG has 100% penetrance so far (all affected with the Xq26.3 duplication have the disease and it affects predominantly females. Isolated non familial cases of X-LAG can either have a constitutional duplication of a chromosome Xq26.3 including &quot;GPR101&quot;, or mosaicism for the duplication (present in a minority of cells) in the case of isolated male patients. X-LAG causes about 10% of cases of pituitary gigantism.

==Mechanism==

The pituitary gland or hypophysis is often referred to as the &quot;master gland&quot; of the human body. Part of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, it controls most of the body&#x27;s endocrine functions via the secretion of various hormones into the circulatory system. The pituitary gland is located below the brain in a depression (fossa) of the sphenoid bone known as the sella turcica. Although anatomically and functionally connected to the brain, the pituitary gland sits outside the blood–brain barrier. It is separated from the subarachnoid space by the diaphragma sella, therefore the arachnoid mater and thus cerebral spinal fluid cannot enter the sella turcica.

The pituitary gland is divided into two lobes, the anterior lobe (which accounts for two thirds of the volume of the gland), and the posterior lobe (one third of the volume) separated by the pars intermedia.

The posterior lobe (the neural lobe or neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland is not, despite its name, a true gland. The posterior lobe contains axons of neurons that extend from the hypothalamus to which it is connected via the pituitary stalk. The hormones vasopressin and oxytocin, produced by the neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, are stored in the posterior lobe and released from axon endings (dendrites) within the lobe.

The pituitary gland&#x27;s anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) is a true gland which produces and secretes six different hormones: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL).

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of pituitary adenoma can be made, or at least suspected, by a constellation of related symptoms presented above.

The differential diagnosis includes pituitary tuberculoma, especially in developing countries and in immumocompromised patients. The diagnosis is confirmed by testing hormone levels, and by radiographic imaging of the pituitary (for example, by CT scan or MRI).

===Classification===
Pituitary adenomas are classified as endocrine tumors and also as brain tumors, though some patient groups prefer not to refer to them as brain tumors. Pituitary adenomas are classified based upon anatomical, histological and functional criteria.
* Anatomically pituitary tumors are classified by their size based on radiological findings; either microadenomas (less than &lt;10 mm) or macroadenomas (equal or greater than ≥10 mm).

:Classification based on radioanatomical findings places adenomas into 1 of 4 grades (I–IV):

:Stage I: microadenomas (&lt;1 cm) without sella expansion.

:Stage II: macroadenomas (≥1 cm) and may extend above the sella.

:Stage III: macroadenomas with enlargement and invasion of the floor or suprasellar extension.

:Stage IV: destruction of the sella.
* Histological classification utilizes an immunohistological characterization of the tumors in terms of their hormone production. Historically they were classed as either basophilic, acidophilic, or chromophobic on the basis of whether or not they took up the tinctorial stains hematoxylin and eosin. This classification has fallen into disuse, in favor of a classification based on what type of hormone is secreted by the tumor. Approximately 20–25% of adenomas do not secrete any readily identifiable active hormones (&#x27;non-functioning tumors&#x27;) yet they are still sometimes referred to as &#x27;chromophobic&#x27;.
* Functional classification is based upon the tumors endocrine activity as determined by serum hormone levels and pituitary tissue cellular hormone secretion detected via immunohistochemical staining. The &quot;Percentage of hormone production cases&quot; values are the fractions of adenomas producing each related hormone of each tumor type as compared to all cases of pituitary tumors, and does not directly correlate to the percentages of each tumor type because of lower or greater incidence of absence of secretion of the expected hormone. Thus, non secretive adenomas may be either &quot;null cell adenomas&quot; or a more specific adenoma that, however, remains non-secretive.
* Any type of pituitary adenocarcinoma listed in the table below may cause compressive symptoms due to local expansion in addition to the systemic effects of secreted hormones listed in the pathology column.
* Null cell adenomas by definition do not secrete hormones, but they commonly cause compressive effects on the pituitary stalk (stalk effect). This leads to decreased levels of dopamine from the hypothalamus reaching the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine exerts an inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. With the absence of this inhibitory effect, prolactin levels increase and are often increased in null cell adenomas. This leads to symptoms of hypogonadism.


====Pituitary incidentalomas====
Pituitary incidentalomas are pituitary tumors that are characterized as an incidental finding. They are often discovered by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed in the evaluation of unrelated medical conditions such as suspected head trauma, in cancer staging or in the evaluation of nonspecific symptoms such as dizziness and headache. It is not uncommon for them to be discovered at autopsy. In a meta-analysis, adenomas were found in an average of 16.7% in postmortem studies, with most being microadenomas (&lt;10mm); macrodenomas accounted for only 0.16% to 0.2% of the decedents. While non-secreting, noninvasive pituitary microadenomas are generally considered to be literally as well as clinically benign, a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed there were, to that time, scant studies of low quality to support this assertion.

The Clinical Practice Guidelines, as published in April 2011 in &quot;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism&quot; by the Endocrine Society (a professional, international medical organization), recommend that all patients with pituitary incidentalomas undergo a complete medical history and physical examination, laboratory evaluations to screen for hormone hypersecretion and for hypopituitarism. If the lesion is in close proximity to the optic nerves or optic chiasm, a visual field examination should be performed. For those with incidentalomas which do not require surgical removal, follow up clinical assessments and neuroimaging should be performed as well follow-up visual field examinations for incidentalomas that abut or compress the optic nerve and chiasm and follow-up endocrine testing for macroincidentalomas.

====Ectopic pituitary adenoma====
An ectopic (occurring in an abnormal place) pituitary adenoma is a rare type of tumor which occurs outside of the sella turcica, most often in the sphenoid sinus, suprasellar region, nasopharynx and the cavernous sinuses.

====Metastases to the pituitary gland====
Carcinomas that metastasize into the pituitary gland are uncommon and typically seen in the elderly, with lung and breast cancers being the most prevalent, In breast cancer patients, metastases to the pituitary gland occur in approximately 6–8% of cases.

Symptomatic pituitary metastases account for only 7% of reported cases. In those who are symptomatic diabetes insipidus often occurs, with rates approximately 29–71%. Other commonly reported symptoms include anterior pituitary dysfunction, visual field defects, headache/pain, and ophthalmoplegia.

==Treatment==
Treatment options depend on the type of tumor and on its size:
* Prolactinomas (microadenomas and macroadenomas) are most often treated with cabergoline or bromocriptine (both dopamine agonists) as the first line of treatment. Medical treatment usually effectively decreases tumor size as well as alleviates symptoms. Pituitary adenomas are also followed by serial imaging (usually MRI) to detect any increase in size or mass effect on nearby structures. If medical therapy fails, the second option is usually transphenoidal pituitary surgery. A third line therapy is radiation therapy, proton therapy to shrink the tumor.
* Thyrotropinomas are treated with transsphenoidal pituitary surgery as the first line treatment option. Medical therapy is a second line treatment, and thyrotropinomas respond to treatment with somatostatin receptor ligands such as octreotide or lanreotide. In people with thyrotropinomas, treatment with somatostatin receptor ligands normalized thyroid hormone levels in 80-90% of people, and 42% of people had a decreased tumor size.
* Somatotrophic adenomas are primarily treated with transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, especially if symptoms of acromegaly are present. A second line treatment strategy (which can be used if there is a persistent or recurrent mass or symptoms after surgery) utilizes medical therapy, including octreotide or lanreotide, which are long-acting somatostatin analogs. These somatostatin receptor analogs inhibit secretion of growth hormone. They were found to be about 50–55% effective in reducing tumor mass and reducing growth hormone and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in studies. The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant is also used in the treatment of somatotrophic adenomas. Pegvisomant blocks the action of growth hormone. It can either be used as monotherapy or combined with a somatostatin analog.
* Corticotropinomas are primarily treated with transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, especially if signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome are present. Medication therapy is second line, and includes steroidogenesis inhibitors (ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, etomidate or mitotane) which decrease production of cortisol, pituitary blockers such as somatostatin receptor ligand pasireotide or the dopamine agonist cabergoline, or the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone. These medications can be combined for a synergistic effect. Medication therapy is often used in conjunction with radiation therapy for corticotropinomas.
* Surgery is a common treatment for pituitary tumors. The normal approach is trans-sphenoidal adenectomy, which usually can remove the tumor without affecting the brain or optic nerves.
* Radiation is also used to treat pituitary adenomas. Examples include external beam or proton beam radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. External radiation of pituitary adenomas can arrest tumor growth for several years but pituitary failure develops within 10 years in most patients necessitating lifelong hormone replacement. Radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas is associated with a four-fold increase in mortality due to cerebrovascular disease. Lifelong monitoring of pituitary hormones is recommended after radiation therapy as hypopituitarism developed in 17% of those undergoing radiation therapy.

<doc id="992806" wikidata="Q7282842" url="?curid=992806" title="Rage (TV program)">
<text>Rage (stylized as rage) is an all-night Australian music video program broadcast on ABC TV on Friday nights, Saturday mornings and Saturday nights. It was first screened on the weekend of Friday, 17 April 1987. With &quot;Soul Train&quot; and &quot;Video Hits&quot; no longer being produced, it is the oldest music television program in the world currently still in production as of 2025.

On Friday and Saturday nights, &quot;Rage&quot; typically starts between 11:00pm and 1:00am. The program is classified MA15+ until 5:00am, where it is rated PG from 5:00 to 11:00am on Saturday mornings, and at 7:00am on Sundays.

==Format==
&quot;Rage&quot; has a minimalist format which has remained largely unchanged since the program&#x27;s inception. Originally created by executive producer Mark FitzGerald in early 1987, the program was originally proposed to be titled &quot;rage &#x27;til you puke&quot;, but which was shortened to &quot;rage&quot;, as this was deemed more likely to be acceptable to the ABC board. It debuted in April 1987, the same month as &quot;MTV Australia&quot; debuted as a late night program on the Nine Network and two months after &quot;Video Hits&quot; debuted on the Ten Network.

The first five music videos shown on &quot;rage&quot; were &quot;Weirdo Libido&quot; by the Lime Spiders, &quot;(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party)&quot; by The Beastie Boys, “You Really Got Me” by The Kinks, “C&#x27;mon Every Beatbox” by Big Audio Dynamite and “Tonight, Tonight, Tonight” by Genesis.

&quot;Rage&quot; was given an idiosyncratic and alternative flavour by music programmers and producers Stephanie Lewis (1987 to 1995) and Narelle Gee (1995 to 2008).

Prior to 1989, &quot;rage&quot; frequently dedicated large amounts of airtime to individual artists and musical styles, often playing an artist&#x27;s entire catalogue of videos. From 1989 this became more structured with Saturday night specials being introduced, with &quot;rage&quot; showing every music video from a nominated artist each Saturday night, usually in chronological order. The first artist featured was Madonna, on 6 May 1989. Other early specials included Midnight Oil, The Cult, The The, Public Image Ltd., Tears for Fears, Scrap Metal, Mental As Anything, Crowded House, Paul Kelly, The Beatles, Hoodoo Gurus, Eurythmics, INXS and Split Enz, plus heavy metal and country music specials.

Guest programmers, who choose the videos aired for an episode, were introduced in January 1990. Mark Fitzgerald and then-programmer Stephanie Lewis came up with the idea along with musician Damien Lovelock. The guest presenters are usually musical artists from Australia or international artists if they happen to be touring Australia, but not always. The ABC presenter Andrew Denton, who is not a musician, was the first guest programmer. Other non-musician guest programmers have included politicians, music video directors (e.g. Richard Lowenstein), and even members of the public. Following the guest programmer’s video selection, &quot;rage&quot; would then typically show all or most of the music videos by that guest programmer, provided they are a musical artist.

With Saturday nights being dedicated to specials and guest programmers, Friday nights became increasingly devoted to new releases and has been almost exclusively such since 1995, showing a range of music genres. Exceptions to this are often made when a well-known musician dies, and &quot;rage&quot; will play a tribute to that musician by opening Friday night’s show with a selection of their videos, bookended by simple white-on-black “In Memory Of” text graphics with the artist’s name and years of life.

The only time a host is seen on &quot;rage&quot; speaking to the camera is when guest programmers appear on the Saturday night edition. Otherwise, the videos are run end-to-end in full and with no voiceovers, with segments only broken up with a quick branding clip or the &quot;rage&quot; logo accompanied by a voice that simply says &quot;rage!&quot;. A &quot;crawl&quot; is also sometimes used during the program, with details of upcoming Specials and Guest Programmers printed in text at the bottom of the screen during a short snippet of a selected clip.

The titling on the videos is also very simple, with the artist and song name displayed briefly after the &quot;rage&quot; logo near the beginning of each video (originally only the artist was identified). Historically, no other graphics, logos or watermarks appear over the clip as it played, but as of 25 June 2010, Kath Earle, Executive Producer with ABC Arts &amp; Entertainment, stated that the Director of Television and Head of Marketing have decided to watermark &quot;rage&quot; to &quot;maintain consistency across the network&quot; as all other programs are watermarked.

On Fridays, when new and recent releases are played, &quot;rage&quot; often gives airtime to little-heard-of new names in the very early hours of Saturday morning. During his &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot; series, John Safran successfully demonstrated &quot;...even a dog can get a video on &quot;rage&quot;&quot;, by attaching a video camera to a dog, and editing the resulting footage together with simply produced looping music.

From 1988, &quot;rage&quot; aired the Australian Top 50 music chart on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Between July 1993 and early 1995, &quot;rage&quot; aired a separate &quot;new releases&quot; program weekly from 2:00am to 4:00am on a Friday morning. However in mid-2006 this practice ceased.

The Saturday night editions, if not guest programmed, are often themed, such as by showing a large amount of an established artist&#x27;s work or a collection of music videos related to a particular topic or event, such as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras or NAIDOC Week.

Another theme in summer, started in 2004, is to replay historic music television programmes including &quot;Countdown&quot; (from the 1970s and &#x27;80s), &quot;Rock Arena&quot; (from the &#x27;80s), &quot;Recovery&quot; (from the &#x27;90s), &quot;GTK&quot; (1970s), &quot;Flashez&quot; (1970s) and &quot;Beatbox&quot; (1980s). This theme is called &quot;Retro Month&quot; and occurred in January from 2004 to 2020, and then was moved to February from 2021.

From November 2015, &#x27;vault&#x27; episodes of &quot;rage&quot; aired on a new programme on Monday nights on ABC, where older music videos are shown. These episodes are often focused around a theme, such as a particular artist, musical genre, record label, country of origin, music video director, or a specific year of release. In March 2023, ‘vault’ episodes were moved to Sunday night.

Because the show usually starts on one day and ends on the next, it is ambiguous as to which day the show belongs. The producers have decided that even if it begins after midnight, its identity belongs to the earlier day (Friday or Saturday) even though the majority of the show (if not all) will be on the later day. This is most likely because television guides in Australia start and end each day at 6:00am.

==Top Fifty/Broadcasts on other ABC TV channels==
Prior to 2006, from around 5:00am or 6:00am to 9:00am on Saturday mornings and 4am to the end of show on Sundays, &quot;Rage&quot; would switch to the weekly Top Fifty from the ARIA singles chart. &quot;Rage&quot; aired the Top 60 chart from 1 September 1990 to 9 March 1991, and from 8 June 1991 to 6 March 1994. If a video from the Top Fifty was unavailable, unsuitable or non-existent, it would be replaced by a splash screen of the &quot;Rage&quot; logo with the position attained in the charts for the week, the artist&#x27;s name and the track&#x27;s title. Also, the videos shown until 6:00am were uncensored (after this, the rating was set back to G-rated material). However, some clips were unavailable in that form, particularly due to heavier restrictions on clips which originated in the United States. Sometimes, two different video clips for the same song were shown in the one session. When this happens, it was often a live (or sometimes remixed) version that was shown earlier in the night/morning, while the &quot;mainstream&quot; censored version shown after 6:00am was shown in the Top Fifty due to classification laws in Australia which prevented adult-oriented material being shown in the after-6:00am time-slot. Since 2005, &quot;Rage&quot; is classified PG when it carries over after 6:00am.

&quot;Rage&quot; has previously had to censor and remove videos which have breached advertorial and editorial guidelines for ABC TV. For example, in 1991, Adidas logos were blurred out in a music video by New Kids on the Block and in 2005 a music video by the Bratz Rock Angelz was removed due to its advertorial content. Post-2000, &quot;Rage&quot; is more liberal and lenient with censorship compared to how it was in the 1990s. For example, &quot;Rage&quot;, by their own discretion, opted to broadcast the Crazy Frog music video &quot;Axel F&quot; uncensored, showing the exposed penis of the frog, deeming it to be non-offensive.

From 2005, the Top Fifty was added to the then-new digital channel ABC2&#x27;s programming schedule as well from 8:00am to 11:00am. The Top Fifty is also broadcast to Asia on Australia Plus and its predecessors Australia Network and Australia Plus since the 2000s and has a large cult audience in the Asia-Pacific region due to the prevalence of pop music there. It shows new release pop music videos.

The weekend of 22 and 23 July 2006 was &quot;Rage&quot;″s last broadcast of the Top Fifty countdown. In its place at 10am to 11am on Saturday mornings is a preview of the upcoming guest programmer or special. &quot;Rage&quot; programming on Sunday mornings includes a mix of new and hit songs. The decision to remove the Top Fifty countdown was made by ABC management, not &quot;Rage&quot; production staff, and was soundly criticized by &quot;Rage&quot;&#x27;s viewing audience, which flooded the program&#x27;s official message boards with complaints. The cessation of the Top Fifty countdown was due to ARIA initiating a commercial association with a telecommunications company; as the commercialism breached ABC guidelines, the Top Fifty could therefore not continue to be shown by &quot;Rage&quot;.

In 2008 and 2009, &quot;Rage&quot; broadcast an assortment of clips on ABC2 on Saturday afternoons.

In 2011, &quot;rage on 3&quot; is top video clips of the week as voted by the ABC3 audience to complement Stay Tuned.

Since 2012, shorter broadcasts have aired transiently overnight during the week.

Regular nightly airings of &quot;Rage&quot; for an hour on ABC3 started in July 2014, airing as the last program of the day.

Since Saturday 21 March 2015 new segment &quot;The Chart&quot; counts down 20 of the most popular videos from the ARIA Singles Chart. The segment also include chart predictions and appearances from some of the most popular acts of today. The Chart airs weekly on &quot;Rage&quot; from 6:00am to 8:00am Saturdays on ABC and is repeated on Sundays at 9.30pm on ABC3.

==Guest programmers==

&quot;Rage&quot; have had many bands and artists host the show on Saturday nights. They select and introduce their favorite music videos of all time. This gives an insight into the bands&#x27; and artists&#x27; influences which are highly regarded by fans. Tapings of &quot;Rage&quot; guest programmers are not only valuable but highly sought after. Some of the guest programmers&#x27; short introductions were viewable on the &quot;Rage&quot; YouTube channel and playlists, but the channel&#x27;s contents were removed in 2023. Clips from shows prior to 2019 were also removed from the &quot;Rage&quot; website on ABC.

Tex Perkins and Bernard Fanning are the most frequent guest programmers with five appearances on the &quot;Rage&quot; couch apiece. The most frequently chosen videos by guest programmers include Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;, The Saints&#x27; &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot;, Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Windowlicker&quot;.

==Simulcast==
From New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992, Triple J had simulcast &quot;Rage&quot; from 1:00am to 6:00am. This ended in 2003 when Triple J introduced their new dance show &quot;The Club&quot; in the same timeslot.

Considering televisions are increasingly stereo as opposed to older mono sets, the simulcast&#x27;s advantage is now moot. Digital television was also becoming popular, and digital television broadcasts can not be precisely synchronised with FM radio transmissions.

==Theme songs, opening/closing sequences and interstitials==
The theme song used to open the show is sampled from Iggy Pop&#x27;s extended version of &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, with Pop&#x27;s vocals and the word &quot;rage&quot; manipulated backwards throughout. The visuals include elements of Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Real Wild Child&quot; video and footage of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe performing &quot;Shout&quot; at Sydney Stadium in 1959. The &quot;Shout&quot; clip was for many years the only surviving footage from the 1959 Australian concert film &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, until the entire film was rediscovered and rereleased in the 2020s.

The song used during the closing credits of the show is an extended remix of &quot;Speed Your Love to Me&quot; by Simple Minds, with visual elements borrowed from Simple Minds&#x27; videos for &quot;Speed Your Love To Me&quot;, &quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot; and &quot;Waterfront&quot;.

The Tony Levin remix of &quot;Sleepless&quot; by King Crimson has also been used as the theme song occasionally.

Several years ago, a third theme was produced (also based on Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;) to break up the guest programmer or specials clips on Saturday nights (except on Saturday mornings with hits and new releases).

In the last few years, the show has been using another theme specifically for the Top Fifty, sampled from the song &quot;She Said&quot; by now-defunct Brisbane band Lavish. It is now used instead of the opening theme to begin the Top Fifty and replace any missing clips.

During TISM&#x27;s appearance on the show, they described the traditional theme song as &quot;...new and exciting...&quot; and its repetition as &quot;always stimulating ... Why see different songs when you can see this one four or five times?&quot;

==Yearly specials==
Up until 2009 for the last weekend of each year, &quot;Rage&quot; had two specials. On the Friday night, a selection of the preceding year&#x27;s Best of videos was played. On the Saturday night, they have a selection of the year&#x27;s Guest Programmers. This show started with a series of Guest Programmers introductions that were shown at the beginning of each of their shows and included them introducing a few of the videos they selected during their program, followed by one or two of their videos.
In 2009, &quot;Rage&quot; launched the &quot;rage 50&quot;; a count down of the top 50 clips of the year, as voted by &quot;Rage&quot; viewers.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999, ABC celebrated the Millennium by broadcasting the 28-hour one-off television program 2000 Today. Due to this, &quot;Rage&quot; had a rare night off air. When the program finished at midnight on New Years Day, &quot;Rage&quot; was the first program on air.

On Sunday 31 December 2006, &quot;Rage&quot; had a New Year&#x27;s Eve special starting from midnight and going until 4:30am. It played all the greatest party songs, to bring in the new year.

For the first weekend of each year, the Top 50 timeslot on &quot;Rage&quot; was used for the Top 50 songs of the previous year. This ceased from 2007 (for the Top 50 songs of 2006).

&quot;Rage&quot; usually broadcasts music videos of songs from the Triple J Hottest 100 over two nights, several weeks after the Hottest 100 broadcast in late January each year (usually sometime during March).

At the end of 2007, the ABC&#x27;s satirical comedy group The Chaser hosted a New Year&#x27;s Eve edition of &quot;Rage&quot;, the event being dubbed &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on &quot;Rage&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Rage New Year&#x27;s Eve Special&quot; is shown on the ABC main channel following the ABC&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve programming.

In 2012, &quot;Rage&quot;&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, guest host Tex Perkins played featured videos of bands and artists that had been on past &quot;Rage&quot; programs.

==Anniversary specials==

===Tenth Anniversary special===
On 19 April 1997, a special episode was aired to celebrate &quot;Rage&quot;″s tenth anniversary. It included a selection, by year, of some of the clips that had aired on &quot;Rage&quot; in the past ten years. It also included some footage of Guest Programmers from over the years. It was repeated later that year on 20 December.

===Twentieth Anniversary special===
&quot;Rage&quot;″s 20th anniversary occurred during April 2007. Each Saturday night, they played videos from an era in &quot;Rage&quot;″s history as well as &quot;immortals&quot; (clips that were not around during the particular years but which were important and influential videos) some of which were introduced by Guest programmers. Each week was introduced by some special footage and ended with a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-style crawl saying which years would be featured the next week (except obviously the last week in which the crawl thanked everyone), and then an exploding birthday cake. It also featured stock footage of each year featured, summarising that year. It also featured a special theme song. The following is a breakdown of what was shown week by week: –
* Week 1 (7 April)
** Tex Perkins, the only man to Guest Program &quot;Rage&quot; four times introduces the special
** clips from 1987 to 1991
* Week 2 (14 April)
** The &quot;Godfather&quot; of &quot;Rage&quot; (its original Executive Producer Mark Fitzgerald) explains how the show got started and explains the theme song. Stephanie Lewis who began the &quot;Rage&quot; Saturday night specials and the &quot;Rage&quot; guest programmers when she produced &quot;Rage&quot;, is also interviewed about the early days of the program
** Clips from 1992 to 1996
* Week 3 (21 April)
** Current Series Producer and Head Programmer Narelle Gee explains &quot;a week at &quot;Rage&quot;&quot;
** clips from 1997 to 2001
* Week 4 (28 April)
** The new &quot;Rage&quot; website is shown (as of 7 October 2007 is up and running) and the original one, which uses Shockwave is explained
** clips from 2002 to 2006
** this week also featured celebrities and festival goers throughout endorsing &quot;Rage&quot; and wishing it a happy birthday.

===Thirtieth Anniversary special===
&quot;Rage&quot;″s 30th anniversary occurred during April 2017. The nation celebrated with a week of programming including two specially produced documentaries which explored the Australian experience of watching the show. The first celebrated the history of &quot;Rage&quot; and explored its influence on Australian music and culture. The program featured a plethora of musical talent and songs from across the decades, musicians whose work has been a mainstay of &quot;Rage&quot; but who were also viewers themselves. The second, &quot;Songs from the Red Couch: 30 Years of Guests Rage Programmers&quot;, delved into the archives to relive some classic moments from the studio. Out of the thousands of songs programmed by their guests over the years a few have been chosen multiple times.

==Real Wild Child book==
A &quot;Rage&quot; book was released in October 2010 by ABC Books/HarperCollins Australia. The author is Narelle Gee and the book is titled &quot;Real Wild Child: An Insider&#x27;s Tales from the Rage Couch&quot;. The book gives an insight behind the scenes of &quot;Rage&quot; and tells the stories of the &quot;Rage&quot; guest programmers. The back cover description poses the question, &quot;What happens when the world&#x27;s biggest musical acts sit down on Australia&#x27;s most famous couch?&quot;

Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine reviewed &quot;Real Wild Child&quot; with this description: &quot;Rage&#x27;s long-time producer recounts the humorous, often slapstick events of a rage taping. She&#x27;s a close observer of her subjects and she conveys almost a hundred sketches of what rock stars are like when their guard drops.&quot;

==CD and DVD releases==
&quot;Rage&quot; has released two double compilation albums, composed of songs that are popular with the programmers.

A series of &quot;Rage&quot; music video DVDs have been released, including &quot;The Chosen Ones&quot;, &quot;Rage Gets Animated&quot;, &quot;Most Chosen&quot;, &quot;Rage in Love&quot;, &quot;Retro Rage&quot;, &quot;The Epic 90s&quot;, &quot;Rage Adults Only&quot;, and &quot;Rage Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Some of these have been combined CD/DVD sets.

A 3-disc 30th anniversary compilation was released in 2017.

==Critical reception==
In 2016, &quot;Junkee&quot; listed &quot;Rage&quot; at #35 in its list of the 60 greatest Australian television shows of all time. The website described &quot;Rage&quot; as an icon for Australian music fans and commended the ABC&#x27;s decision to not alter the program from its original format despite it being on air for several decades.

In 2019, &quot;TV Week&quot; listed &quot;Rage&quot; at #97 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly &quot;TV Week Close Up&quot; publication. The magazine said the show has been the &quot;go-to&quot; for any music lover since its inception, and that while rival programs have run their course, &quot;Rage&quot; is still going strong.

<text>Zeenat Amanullah Khan (born 19 November 1951), known professionally as Zeenat Aman, is an Indian actress and model who mainly works in Hindi films. One of the leading actresses of Indian cinema, she established herself as one of the highest paid actresses of her time and is cited in the media as a sex symbol. She is the recipient of a Filmfare Award from three nominations. 

Aman first received recognition after winning the Femina Miss India pageant and the Miss Asia Pacific International pageant in 1970. Aman began acting that same year, appearing in the films &quot;The Evil Within&quot; (1970), Hungama (1971) and &quot;Hulchul&quot; (1971). Her breakthrough came with Dev Anand&#x27;s drama film &quot;Haré Rama Haré Krishna&quot; (1971), which won her the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Award for Best Actress and the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She continued to rise to prominence in the 1970s, playing leading roles in films such as &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973), &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot; (1974), &quot;Ajanabee&quot; (1974), &quot;Warrant&quot; (1975), &quot;Chori Mera Kaam&quot; (1975), &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; (1977), &quot;Chhailla Babu&quot; (1977), &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Great Gambler&quot; (1979). She also starred as Roma in the action film &quot;Don&quot; (1978), and was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the controversial film &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot; (1978). Also in 1978, she married Sanjay Khan; after suffering a highly-publicized domestic violence incident from Khan, the marriage was annulled in 1979. 

In the early 1980s, Aman had leading roles in &quot;Abdullah&quot; (1980), &quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot; (1980), &quot;Qurbani&quot; (1980), &quot;Dostana&quot; (1980), and &quot;Insaf Ka Tarazu&quot; (1980), the lattermost of which earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She continued acting in films throughout the early 1980s, with roles in the films &quot;Laawaris&quot; (1981), &quot;Teesri Aankh&quot; (1982), &quot;Mahaan&quot; (1983), &quot;Pukar&quot; (1983), and &quot;Jagir&quot; (1984). After her marriage to actor Mazhar Khan in 1985, she began acting less frequently in films. After appearing in the courtroom drama film &quot;Gawaahi&quot; (1989), she took a hiatus to focus on her marriage which lasted until Khan&#x27;s death in 1998. In 1999, Aman returned with a minor role in the film &quot;Bhopal Express&quot;. After another brief hiatus, she appeared in the film &quot;Boom&quot; (2003). She has since had roles in several independent films, including &quot;Ugly Aur Pagli&quot; (2008), &quot;Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon&quot; (2010), &quot;Chaurahen&quot; (2012), &quot;Strings of Passion&quot; (2014), &quot;Dunno Y2... Life Is a Moment&quot; (2015), &quot;Dil Toh Deewana Hai&quot; (2016), and &quot;Sallu Ki Shaadi&quot; (2017), and the war film &quot;Panipat&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Zeenat Aman was born as Zeenat Amanullah Khan in Bombay on 19 November 1951, to a Pathan Muslim father, Amanullah Khan, and a Maharashtrian Hindu Brahmin mother, Vardhini Scindia Scharwächter. Aman is the cousin of actor Raza Murad and the niece of actor Murad. Amanullah Khan was a screenwriter for movies such as &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960) and (1972), often writing under the nom de plume &quot;Aman&quot;, which she later adopted as her screen name. Zeenat had lost her father at a young age while still in her school years. Amanullah&#x27;s mother Akhtar Jahan Begum was a first cousin to Hamidullah Khan, the last Nawab of Bhopal.

Aman&#x27;s parents divorced when she was young. When she was 13, her father died. She completed her schooling in Panchgani and attended University of Southern California in Los Angeles on student aid, but could not complete her graduation.

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
In 1970, she participated in the Femina Miss India pageant, where she came in second place and was titled the &#x27;First Princess&#x27;. Following this, she competed in, and won, the Miss Asia Pacific International pageant, becoming the person to hold both pageant titles at the same time. After winning these pageants Aman began acting, appearing first in the film &quot;The Evil Within&quot; (1970) alongside Dev Anand, which was commercially unsuccessful. In 1971, Aman appeared in a minor role in O. P. Ralhan&#x27;s &quot;Hulchul&quot;, and in the same year appeared in the film &quot;Hungama&quot;, which starred Vinod Khanna, Kishore Kumar, Mehmood and Helen; both films were flops at the box office. Actor and director Dev Anand soon approached Aman to star as Jasbir/Janice in his 1971 musical drama &quot;Haré Rama Haré Krishna&quot;, after actress Zaheeda turned down the role. The film was a critical and commercial success, and proved to be a breakthrough for Aman. She won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association Award for Best Actress (Hindi) for her performance in the film.

In the 1970s, &quot;Cine Blitz&quot; magazine was launched, with Aman on the cover of its first issue. In 1973, she starred in &quot;Heera Panna&quot;, yet again appearing alongside Anand, and in Nasir Hussain&#x27;s &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; as Sunita, the love interest of Vijay Arora. The latter film was described by film scholar Kaushik Baumik as &quot;the first quintessential Bollywood film&quot;, proved to be a major commercial success at the box office. Aman&#x27;s performance in the song &quot;Chura Liya Hai Tumne Jo Dil Ko&quot; garnered considerable attention, after which she became known as the &quot;girl in white carrying a guitar&quot;. She also starred in &quot;Dhund&quot; (1973) alongside Sanjay Khan and Danny Denzongpa; its plot was inspired by the Agatha Christie novel &quot;The Unexpected Guest&quot;. The cast&#x27;s performance was praised, and the film was a moderate commercial success.

In 1974, Aman starred in Manoj Kumar&#x27;s action drama &quot;Roti Kapda Aur Makaan&quot;, where she portrayed Sheetal, an opportunist who deserts her jobless lover for a millionaire. Aman had continued to star alongside Dev Anand throughout the year, appearing together in &quot;Prem Shastra&quot; and &quot;Ishq Ishq Ishq&quot;. She played Nisha, a recovering prostitute, in the Shammi Kapoor-directed film &quot;Manoranjan&quot;, and starred in &quot;Ajanabee&quot; as Rashmi, an ambitious girl who runs away to marry her lover but then faces a difficult choice; the latter film had an average box office performance. In 1975, Aman appeared in two films: she portrayed an assassin &quot;Warrant&quot;, and played &#x27;Sharmeeli&#x27; in &quot;Chori Mera Kaam&quot;; both films were successful.

Aman appeared in &quot;Deewaangee&quot; alongside Shashi Kapoor, and had an uncredited voice role in &quot;Balika Badhu&quot;. In 1977, she starred as a princess in &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; alongside Dharmendra, Jeetendra, and Neetu Singh. This was the second highest-grossing Hindi film of that year. She had roles in the films &quot;Darling Darling&quot; (again alongside Dev Anand) and &quot;Chhailla Babu&quot;, which was a commercial success. Aman next appeared in &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot; as Sunita, the lover of Rishi Kapoor, which was the third highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Aman next attempted to enter Hollywood with Krishna Shah&#x27;s film &quot;Shalimar&quot;, but it proved unsuccessful in both the United States and India. She next acted in &quot;Heeralaal Pannalal&quot; with Shashi Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor and Neetu Singh, then starred in &quot;Chor Ke Ghar Chor&quot; opposite Ashok Kumar and Randhir Kapoor .

Aman next starred in Raj Kapoor&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot; (1978), which she influenced Kapoor to let her audition for, as she described to &quot;Cinestaan&quot;: &quot;When I knocked on the door and he [Kapoor] asked who it was, I replied, &#x27;Your future heroine&#x27;. I think he was touched by my dedication and determination to act in his film&quot;. The film was a box office success, but it initially drew criticism from critics, with many describing the plot as counter-intuitive; the subject dealt with the &quot;soul being more attractive than the body&quot; despite Kapoor&#x27;s showcase of Aman&#x27;s sex appeal. Aman&#x27;s performance in the film garnered high praise and she received her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Also in 1978, Aman originated the role of Roma in the film &quot;Don&quot;. The producer of the film, Nariman Irani, had been losing money at the time, which led the actress to take the role to help him and refusing payment for her work. Irani died midway through filming. The film released to significant commercial success, while garnering positive reviews for Aman&#x27;s performance. It inspired the Don franchise, where Aman&#x27;s character has been portrayed by Priyanka Chopra.

In 1979, Aman starred as Shabnam in &quot;The Great Gambler&quot;. She described her experience working on the film as one of her favourites, particularly when they filmed in Italy. When released, it became a sleeper hit. Her final role that year was a guest appearance in the film &quot;Gol Maal.&quot;

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Aman first had roles in the films &quot;Takkar&quot; as Sapna, and in &quot;Ram Balram&quot; as Madhu. She also starred as Radha alongside Vinod Khanna in &quot;Bombay 405 Miles&quot;. Aman next starred as Zainab in the Sanjay Khan directed film &quot;Abdullah&quot;, starring alongside Raj Kapoor, Danny Denzongpa and Khan himself. The film had one of the highest budgets spent on any film at the time. Despite underperforming in India, the film achieved success in the Soviet Union. Aman next starred as Fatima in the Indian-Soviet produced film &quot;Adventures of Ali-Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot;, better known as &quot;Alibaba Aur 40 Chor&quot;, which is one of three film adaptations of the original folk tale, and was also noted for being one of the first movies to cast actors of other nationalities. It was a moderate success, and was one of the more successful Indian-Soviet co-productions.

Aman next starred in the Feroz Khan-directed film &quot;Qurbani&quot; alongside Khan and Vinod Khanna; she was cast as Sheela, a singer and dancer. The film was a major success at the box-office, and the soundtrack received particular praise. The song &quot;Aap Jaisa Koi&quot;, which had been sung by Nazia Hassan and picturised on Aman, received high praise. Aman also starred as Sheetal in the film &quot;Dostana&quot; alongside Amitabh Bachchan. She was next cast as a rape victim seeking justice in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Insaf Ka Tarazu&quot;, which was one of few films at the time to focus on its storyline rather than its soundtrack. The film earned Aman critical acclaim and her second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. In 1981, Aman appeared in four films: first starrimg as Sonia, the love interest to Dharmendra, in &quot;Professor Pyarelal&quot;, followed by starring as Jamila &quot;Katilon Ke Kaatil&quot;, then appeared as Neera in &quot;Krodhi&quot; and a leading role alongside Amitabh Bachchan in &quot;Laawaris&quot;.

In 1982, Aman starred in the crime film &quot;Ashanti&quot;. In 1983, she starred in &quot;Mahaan&quot; as Rita, which was the first film to feature a triple-role character. The film turned to be an above-average grosser. In the same year, she starred as Julie in &quot;Pukar&quot;, which had an average performance at the box office. Her final role of that year was as Nisha Thakur in &quot;Hum Se Hai Zamana&quot;. In 1984, she starred in &quot;Jagir&quot; as the main heroine Sima, alongside Dharmendra, Mithun Chakraborty and Pran.

From 1985 to 1989, she appeared less frequently in films to focus more on her marriage with Mazhar Khan; her films in this period were critically and financially unsuccessful. She starred in the film &quot;Gawahi&quot;, a courtroom drama, which would be her last film role before temporarily retiring from the film industry. 

=== 2000s ===
After ten years of inactivity, Aman appeared in a cameo role in &quot;Bhopal Express&quot;. She didn&#x27;t appear in another film until 2003, when she played Alice in &quot;Boom&quot;. The film drastically underperformed at the box office, creating financial problems for the film&#x27;s crew, including the producer Ayesha Shroff.

In 2004, she appeared as Mrs. Robinson in the play &quot;The Graduate&quot; staged at St Andrew&#x27;s Auditorium in Mumbai. She also made an appearance, along with actress Hema Malini, in the talk show &quot;Koffee with Karan&quot; hosted by Karan Johar. Aman then had roles in the films &quot;Maksham&quot; (2005), &quot;Jaana... Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot; (2006) as Raju&#x27;s mother, and in &quot;Chaurahen&quot; which was released in 2012, but had originally been filmed and shelved in 2007. In 2008, Aman guest starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Ugly Aur Pagli&quot;. The following year, she starred in the film &quot;Geeta in Paradise&quot;. In 2008, Aman received a Lifetime Achievement Award during the Zee Cine Awards, as a recognition of her contribution to Hindi Cinema. She also received an &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema&quot; award at the 2010 IIFA Awards held at Colombo, Sri Lanka.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Aman starred as Rebecca in &quot;Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon&quot;. Originally aired at film festivals nationwide, the film drew immense controversy and was panned by critics for its gay stereotypes. However, the film achieved success through film festivals and later achieved a limited theatrical release. In the film, Aman performed the songs &quot;Aap Jaisa Koi&quot; and &quot;Chura Liya Hai Tumne Jo&quot;. It later spawned the sequel &quot;Dunno Y2... Life Is a Moment&quot;, released in 2014, which Aman also starred in. In 2012, Aman was cast as Roma in the film &quot;Strings of Passion&quot;. Aman had roles in the films &quot;Dil Toh Deewana Hai&quot; (2016) and &quot;Sallu Ki Shaadi&quot; (2017). &quot;Sallu Ki Shaadi&quot; was made as a tribute to actor Salman Khan.

In 2017, Aman was cast in the short-lived web series &quot;Love Life &amp; Screw Ups&quot;, in which she played the main role of Joanna, a spinster with a drastic love life and personal problems, who frequently mingles with younger people. The show was featured in international film festivals, including a film festival in Poland, being the first Indian web series to be shown at a festival there. While the series received generally mixed reviews, Aman&#x27;s performance was praised by critics. 

In June 2019, Aman joined the cast of the film &quot;Panipat&quot;, where she portrayed the minor role of Sakina Begum, a character described by director Ashutosh Gowariker as &quot;a feisty character leading her province of Hoshiyarganj.&quot; It was released theatrically in December 2019, emerging as a box-office failure. In a September 2019 interview with Eastern Eye, Aman discussed her current activity in the film industry, saying that &quot;There are no great age appropriate roles for ladies my age. They are very few and far between in Hindi cinema, so that&#x27;s it, but I wouldn&#x27;t say no if a really great role came along.&quot; 

=== 2020s ===
In February 2020, it was announced that Aman was staging a comeback in theatre, appearing in a play on Kasturba Gandhi. In January 2021, it was announced that she would star in the upcoming murder-mystery film &quot;Margaon: The Closed File&quot;, her first leading role since the 1980s. In the film, which is a tribute to Agatha Christie, Aman portrayed the &quot;head of an Anglo Indian family who is an independent woman, a mother as well as an entrepreneur.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Aman is regarded as one of the greatest actresses of Indian cinema. One of the highest paid actress of the 1970s and early 1980s, Aman appeared in &quot;Box Office India&quot;″s &quot;Top Actresses&quot; list eight times (from 1974 to 1981). In 2022, she was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actresses&quot; list. 

Aman initially met with controversy in her acting career for her sexualisation in a number of films, which some critics and fans believed overshadowed her performances. Commenting on this, she told &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t regret or feel bad about anything that happened or may not have happened. If I lost something, I gained something more. The fact that I can look back at my career with so much pride and happiness means I have had a good run without any complaints.&quot; She has frequently been cited as the original sex symbol of Bollywood, and is notorious for her figure and looks. However, Aman has stated that she does not take the label seriously, and rather felt restricted by it.

In March 2016, an exhibition created by artist Mina Siddique was launched in Dubai which featured various works and arts dedicated to Aman. It was titled as &quot;Zeenat Aman&quot;, with the tagline &quot;Redefining Beauty&quot;. The event was attended by Aman herself, as well as members from various countries, including UAE and Pakistan. In April 2019, &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; listed Aman as one of the &quot;10 Hottest Bollywood Actresses Of All Time&quot;.

In 2019 Aman commented on dealing with media exposure, saying that &quot;...I haven&#x27;t got used to it and feel very blessed. Like I said to you, it is only now I have realised how blessed I am. I see people watching my films and songs as a blessing. There is a wonderful feeling of nostalgia when they see my films and songs. Whenever I am in their city, they reach out to me with that love and I feel very blessed and grateful for the same.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 1978, Aman married actor Sanjay Khan, who was already married and father of four children; this marriage was annulled in 1979, after Sanjay Khan beat her and physically assaulted her. What happened was that after finishing the shooting of &quot;Abdullah&quot; and while she was shooting for B R Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Insaf Ka Tarazu&quot;, she received a phone call from Khan asking to discuss reshooting specific scenes for the film &quot;Abdullah&quot; to which she informed him that she is already committed to &quot;Insaf Ka Tarazu&quot; shooting but hearing that he became angry and accused her of infidelity. Hearing those accusations, she took leave from B R Chopra and came to meet with him at a hotel where he was partying in one of the suites. Upon seeing her, he became furious and took to a room in the suite, where he beat her severely, resulting in many injuries, particularly to her right eye. This was witnessed by his wife, who allegedly joined him and cheered him on to keep beating Aman. The incident left Aman with a lazy eye, and she later stated that she pretends it never happened.

Aman then married actor Mazhar Khan in 1985, and remained married until his death in 1998. With Mazhar, she has two sons: Azaan Khan, a film director who directed the heist film &quot;Bankster,&quot; and composer Zahaan Khan. The family lives in Mumbai. Of her marriage to Mazhar, Aman stated she was unhappy, revealing in 1999, on the show &quot;Rendezvous with Simi Garewal&quot;: 

In February 2018, Aman filed a rape case against businessman Aman Khanna, better known as Sarfaraz. After stalking, harassing, and robbing Aman, as well as allegedly raping Aman various times, charges were pressed against Khanna which led to his incarceration. The incidents described were said to have taken place between 2011 and 2016.

<text>Shogun Assassin is a 1980 &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film directed by Robert Houston. It was edited and compiled from the first two films in the &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; series, using 12 minutes of the first film, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance&quot; (&quot;Kozure Ōkami: Kowokashi udekashi tsukamatsuru&quot; or &quot;Wolf with Child in Tow: Child and Expertise for Rent&quot;), and most of &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx&quot; (&quot;Kozure Ōkami: Sanzu no kawa no ubaguruma&quot; or &quot;Wolf with Child in Tow: Perambulator of the River of Sanzu&quot;), both released in 1972 and based on the long-running 1970s manga series &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; created by the writer Kazuo Koike and the artist Goseki Kojima.

==Plot==

As the opening credits roll, an abbreviated version of Ogami Ittō&#x27;s (Tomisaburô Wakayama) past as Shogunate Decapitator and his wife&#x27;s murder by ninja are seen, with Daigorō (Akihiro Tomikawa) providing the narration.

Two hooded samurai attack Ogami while he is pushing a cart with Daigorō inside. Ogami fends off the attack and kills both attackers. 

As Ogami and Daigorō sit by a roadside fire and eat their evening meal, Ogami remembers how he offered the infant Daigorō the life–death choice: either Ogami&#x27;s sword (which would mean that Daigorō would join him on his mission of vengeance against the Shogun) or Daigorō&#x27;s ball (which would mean that Daigorō would be killed so that he could be with his mother in heaven). Daigorō chooses the sword. The next day, the Shogun&#x27;s officials bring Ogami the Shogun&#x27;s orders: either swear eternal loyalty or commit &quot;seppuku&quot; with Daigorō. Ogami chooses to fight his way to freedom with Daigorō, only to have his path blocked by the leader of the Yagyu clan, in charge of the Shogun&#x27;s spies and assassins. The leader challenges Ogami to fight his son Kurando in a duel; if Ogami wins, he wins his freedom. Ogami accepts. Despite Kurando&#x27;s having the strategic advantage of having the sun behind him and Daigorō riding on Ogami&#x27;s back, at the last moment, Ogami ducks his head to reveal a mirror bound on Daigorō&#x27;s forehead, which reflects the sun into Kurando&#x27;s eyes, blinding him long enough for Ogami to slice off Kurando&#x27;s head.

Ogami and Daigorō journey on, never stopping in one place for very long as the Shogun&#x27;s ninjas are always following them. As they wander, Daigorō recalls how the Shogun&#x27;s other son Lord Bizen (Taketoshi Naitô) and his men were given orders to kill him. Even though Bizen&#x27;s men are wearing armor beneath their robes, Ogami&#x27;s skill and blade are too powerful. Ogami lures Lord Bizen into the middle of a stream, concealing his sword underwater within his left hand while pretending it is clutched in his right, prompting Bizen to strike at his right hand, while Ogami counters with his concealed blade, killing him. Ogami sees the Yagyu daimyo watching from a distance and he will destroy him and all of his ninjas.

The self-titled &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot;, a female (Kayo Matsuo), receives orders from the Shogun to kill Ogami and Daigorō. Lord Kurogawa (Akiji Kobayashi) does not believe the &quot;Supreme Ninja&#x27;s&quot; women are up to the task, so she has eight of her ninjas simultaneously swordfight Kurogawa&#x27;s strongest ninja, Junai. Junai nevers succeeds in injuring any of the women, but continues to fight as long as possible as various of his body parts are removed, until the final coup de grace. 

Ogami and Daigorō meet secretly with a client to discuss an assassination request. Ogami is asked to kill Lord Kiru (the Shogun&#x27;s brother), and in return he will receive a thousand pieces of gold. Ogami accepts the mission and is told that Lord Kiru is being escorted by a three-brother team known as the &#x27;Masters of Death.&#x27;

During Ogami and Daigorō&#x27;s journey, they are attacked several times by The &quot;Supreme Ninja&#x27;s&quot; women, but Ogami kills them each time. Ogami finally faces the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; herself. She attacks Ogami with a weighted net that contains fishhooks, but Ogami cuts himself free and the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; flees by running away backwards.

Ogami and Daigorō keep on traveling, but they now come face-to-face with Lord Kurogawa&#x27;s entire ninja force. Pushing Daigorō in his cart to safety, Ogami uses the spear blades in the cart&#x27;s handrails to attack. All but two of the ninja are cut down, but Ogami is left wounded. He manages to push Daigorō to the safety of a deserted hut before collapsing from loss of blood. Daigorō goes in search of water for his father, finally bringing it back in his mouth, then takes some food offerings from a roadside shrine, leaving his jacket in honorable exchange.

The &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; meets with Lord Kurogawa to report her failure, but Lord Kurogawa has another plan: to strike at Ogami through Daigorō.

Later that night, Daigorō is lured outside the hut by the sound of a woman singing. Waking up to find Daigorō gone, Ogami searches for his son. He finds Daigorō is a prisoner of Lord Kurogawa and the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot;. Daigorō is tied up and suspended over a deep well; Kurogawa demands that Ogami surrender or he will drop Daigorō down the well. Ogami refuses, so Kurogawa and his men attack. Kurogawa lets go of the rope suspending Daigorō over the well, but Ogami manages to stamp his foot down on the rope, stopping the drop, and kill Kurogawa (and his two ninjas) at the same time. Ignoring the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot;, who has not moved throughout the fight, Ogami carefully pulls Daigorō, who has survived, up to safety. Instead of killing the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot;, Ogami walks away with Daigorō.

Ogami and Daigorō board a ship which is carrying the &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27; to their rendezvous with Lord Kiru. Also on board is the unobtrusive &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot;. Rebels attack the &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27;, but are easily dispatched. During the night, the sole remaining rebel starts a fire onboard the ship. In the ensuing inferno, the &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27; tell Ogami that they recognize him, but that they will not attack him...as long as he makes no move against them and Lord Kiru, and then leave him. The companionway is blocked by flames, so he cuts through the deck planking. Ogami then puts Daigorō in his cart and throws both overboard to safety, before pole-vaulting himself into the sea. The &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; attacks Ogami from underwater but he overpowers her. Getting Daigorō, himself, and the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; to shore and then to the shelter of a fisherman&#x27;s hut, he strips all three of them naked and gathers them close together, telling the &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; that they must share their body heat or die. The &quot;Supreme Ninja&quot; does not understand why he would save her and then realizes she cannot kill Ogami or his son. The next day, Ogami and Daigorō leave her there, knowing that she will have to return to the Shogun, report her failure and commit suicide.

The &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27; escort Lord Kiru and his entourage through a desert of sand dunes, where they are attacked by a rebel force concealed under the sand. The &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27; kill all of the rebels, and Lord Kiru is taken to safety. However, they have not gone far before they see Daigorō standing in their path. He points in the distance towards Ogami, who is waiting for them to come to him, and so move away from his son who could be a liability. The &#x27;Masters of Death&#x27; finally face off against Ogami, but one by one they are cut down. Ogami then chases after Lord Kiru&#x27;s procession, killing or driving off the guards. Lord Kiru protests that he is the Shogun&#x27;s brother, but Ogami tells Kiru that the &quot;Shogun means nothing&quot; to him. Ogami then cuts Lord Kiru down.

As he and his father walk away from the carnage, Daigorō looks back one last time and says via voice-over, &quot;I guess I wish it was different ... but a wish is only a wish&quot;. The final shot is a freeze-frame close-up of Daigorō&#x27;s face looking back.

==Production==
&quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; is a combination of two Japanese films, predominantly that of &quot;Baby-cart at the River Styx&quot; (1972) and 12 minutes of &quot;Sword of Vengeance&quot;. In Japan the movie is known as &quot;子連れ狼, Kozure Okami.&quot;

The project was directed by Robert Houston and his partner David Weisman, a protégé of Andy Warhol and director of &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; (1972). A fan of the original &quot;Kozure Ōkami&quot; films, Weisman had obtained the rights for $50,000 from the American office of Toho Studios.

The title character, Ogami Ittō, is played by Tomisaburo Wakayama, brother of the producer, Shintaro Katsu, who is known for playing Zatoichi in a series of 26 films starting in the 1960s. As a result, it has garnered a cult following.

==Release==
&quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; was released theatrically in the United States 11 November 1980 by Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures to the grindhouse movie circuit in the United States, and then later as a video cassette from MCA/Universal Home Video. When released in the United Kingdom by the Vipco video tape label in 1983, &quot;Shogun Assassin&#x27;s&quot; extreme violence almost caused it to be banned in the UK by the Home Office. Vipco played this for publicity in the cover art of their 2000 release on DVD, which was stamped &quot;Banned since 1983!&quot; The poster and title treatment was created by artist Jim Evans. Jim’s son Gibran Evans voiced the narrative as Daigorō. In 2006 it was restored and re-released on DVD in the United States by AnimEigo, and again in 2016 by Criterion for Blu-Ray.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; &quot;is as furiously mixed up as &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Tiger Lily?&quot;&quot; and that outside &quot;the little-boy&#x27;s narration, the movie&#x27;s not much fun once you&#x27;ve gotten the picture, which is that of a tubby, outcast samurai wandering the length and breadth of Japan, pushing an antique baby carriage that contains his tiny, remarkably observant son.&quot; John Pym (&quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;) found that &quot;the impetus of the original director&#x27;s intention seems somehow to have been turned round by having the story related from the point of view of the uncomprehending Daigorō&quot;, whose narration he compared to that of Linda Manz&#x27;s &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;). &quot;What has evidently animated this American version is the packaging of ample bloodshed with the minimum of explanation. Thus, we never really learn why the samurai&#x27;s wife is murdered; and such scenes as the one in which the headsman compels his son to make a fateful choice between a sword and a pretty raffia ball go for nothing.&quot; The review concluded that &quot;the swordplay is of a high, non-exploitative order, and what narrative elements remain—the fire of the ship, for example—are handled with admirable vigour&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, Stuart Galbraith IV of DVD Talk said, &quot;A radical reworking of not one but two Japanese movies combined into a single action-filled extravaganza, &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; floored audiences with its dream-like, poetic action and pressure-cooker bloodletting.&quot; Tim Lucas (&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;) described Houston&#x27;s version as an &quot;ingenious and deeply imagined reinterpretation also turns out to be a conspicuous example of a beloved grindhouse experience that was in fact rewritten, [rescored] (by Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and disembowelled in the cutting room&quot;

==In popular culture==
Dialogue excerpts from the film have been sampled in hip-hop music, with samples from the film being prominently featured in several songs from the 1995 album &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; by GZA. Dialogue from the film was also sampled in the song &quot;Agent Orange&quot; by rapper Cage, from his debut album &quot;Movies for the Blind&quot; (2002). In the 2004 film &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;, Beatrix Kiddo and her four-year-old daughter watch the film as a bedtime story.

<doc id="992829" wikidata="Q1177092" url="?curid=992829" title="Microcell">
<text>A microcell is a cell in a mobile phone network served by a low power cellular base station (tower), covering a limited area such as a mall, a hotel, or a transportation hub. A microcell is usually larger than a picocell, though the distinction is not always clear. A microcell uses power control to limit the radius of its coverage area.

Typically the range of a microcell is less than two kilometers wide, whereas standard base stations may have ranges of up to 35 kilometres (22 mi). A picocell, on the other hand, is 200 meters or less, and a femtocell is on the order of 10 meters, although AT&amp;T calls its femtocell that has a range of , a &quot;microcell&quot;. AT&amp;T uses &quot;AT&amp;T 3G MicroCell&quot; as a trademark and not necessarily the &quot;microcell&quot; technology, however.

A microcellular network is a radio network composed of microcells.

== Rationale ==
Like picocells, microcells are usually used to add network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage, such as train stations. Microcells are often deployed temporarily during sporting events and other occasions in which extra capacity is known to be needed at a specific location in advance.

Cell size flexibility is a feature of 2G (and later) networks and is a significant part of how such networks have been able to improve capacity. Power controls implemented on digital networks make it easier to prevent interference from nearby cells using the same frequencies. By subdividing cells, and creating more cells to help serve high density areas, a cellular network operator can optimize the use of spectrum and ensure capacity can grow. By comparison, older analog systems have fixed limits, beyond which attempts to subdivide cells simply would result in an unacceptable level of interference.

== Microcell/picocell-only networks ==
Certain mobile phone systems, notably PHS and DECT, only provide microcellular (and Pico cellular) coverage. Microcellular systems are typically used to provide low cost mobile phone systems in high-density environments such as large cities. PHS is deployed throughout major cities in Japan as an alternative to ordinary cellular service. DECT is used by many businesses to deploy private license-free microcellular networks within large campuses where wireline phone service is less useful. DECT is also used as a private, non-networked, cordless phone system where its low power profile ensures that nearby DECT systems do not interfere with each other.

A forerunner of these types of network was the CT2 cordless phone system, which provided access to a looser network (without handover), again with base stations deployed in areas where large numbers of people might need to make calls. CT2&#x27;s limitations ensured the concept never took off. CT2&#x27;s successor, DECT, was provided with an interworking profile, GIP so that GSM networks could make use of it for microcellular access, but in practice the success of GSM within Europe, and the ability of GSM to support microcells without using alternative technologies, meant GIP was rarely used, and DECT&#x27;s use in general was limited to non-GSM private networks, including use as cordless phone systems.

<doc id="992832" wikidata="Q841260" url="?curid=992832" title="Runglish">
<text>Runglish, Ruslish, Russlish (), or Russian English, is a language born out of a mixture of the English and Russian languages. This is common among Russian speakers who speak English as a second language, and it is mainly spoken in post-Soviet States.

The earliest of these portmanteau words is &quot;Russlish&quot;, dating from 1971. Appearing later are (chronologically): &quot;Russglish&quot; (1991), &quot;Ruglish&quot; (1993), &quot;Ringlish&quot; (1996), &quot;Ruslish&quot; (1997), &quot;Runglish&quot; (1998), &quot;Rusglish&quot; (1999), and &quot;Rusinglish&quot; (2015).

Runglish is formed by adaptation of English phrases and words into Russian-style by adding affixes, with the purpose of using it in everyday communication. Runglish is a neologism used to represent at least two different combinations of Russian and English: pidgin and informal latinizations of the Cyrillic alphabet.

Although less widespread than other pidgins and creoles, such as Tok Pisin, Runglish is spoken in a number of English-Russian communities, such as in Southern Australia and most notably the Russian-speaking community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, New York. Brighton Beach has been nicknamed &quot;Little Odessa&quot; due to its population of Russian-speaking immigrants from Ukraine and Russia. Runglish is considered to be used and spoken by at least 130 million people. This number mainly consists of Russian-speaking immigrants and their descendants.

== Origins ==
=== History ===
The appearance of Runglish has been caused by a number of social, scientific and political factors from the 19th to 21st centuries.

One of the multiple causes for the blending of the two languages is the increased immigration of Russian speaking communities to the English-speaking parts of the world, and specifically the United States. The main periods of the immigration are the following:

* The Imperial Russian religious prosecutions (pogroms),
* Russian Revolution,
* Russian Civil War,
* Soviet era repressions
* Post-Soviet period.

The exposure of English to Russian speech and literature continued with the fall of the Soviet Union, as the Iron Curtain had been eliminated, which opened a possibility for international tourism and communication. Additionally important was the expansion of international contacts, the creation of partnerships and alliances in which English was the main language of communication, state computerization, and, most importantly, the introduction of the Internet.

=== Brighton Beach ===
In the United States, Runglish is used in a number of Russian communities. Runglish is particularly popular among the Russian-speaking community in Brighton Beach in New York. Brighton Beach, a small area in New York, is rightfully considered the capital of &quot;Russian English&quot;. Before the Great Depression, Brighton Beach used to be a fashionable destination. However, as the economic crisis progressed, luxurious life in the southern part of Brooklyn came to an end, and poor immigrants began populating it instead of wealthy European tourists. For a long time, Brighton Beach was considered to be poor, inaccessible and criminal. Soon, Brighton Beach became a home for many immigrants from all over the world, particularly from the USSR. The arrival of Russian-speaking immigrants helped to gradually develop a former disadvantaged neighbourhood into a powerful community with its own infrastructure, lifestyle and language.
The following are the examples of the Runglish words that are widely used on daily basis in Brighton Beach:

* Driving: Драйвить, &quot;Draivit&quot; (proper Russian: вести машину/ехать, &quot;vyesti mashinu/yekhat&quot;)
* Case: Kейс, &quot;Keis&quot; (proper Russian: портфель-атташе, &quot;portfel-attashe,&quot; also дело, &quot;delo&quot; as in &quot;legal case&quot;)
* Donuts: Донаты, &quot;Donaty&quot; (proper Russian: пончики, &quot;ponchiki&quot;)
* Appointments: Аппойнтменты, &quot;Appoyntmenty&quot; (proper Russian: Назначения [на приём], &quot;naznacheniya [na priyom]&quot;)

=== NASA ===

The term &quot;Runglish&quot; was popularized by Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev in 2000, describing the way Russian and American cosmonauts spoke on the International Space Station. Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev said: &quot;We say jokingly that we communicate in &#x27;Runglish,&#x27; a mixture of Russian and English languages, so that when we are short of words in one language we can use the other, because all the crew members speak both languages well.&quot; Ever since, NASA has begun listing Runglish as one of the on-board languages.

== In culture ==
Runglish is widely used in poetry (Vladimir Mayakovsky &quot;American Russians&quot;), music (Splean &quot;My English-Russian dictionary&quot;) and in prose (Arthur С. Clarke&#x27;s 1982 novel, 2010: Odyssey Two&quot;). A monthly published periodical called &quot;Wind—New Zealand Russian&quot; existed from 1996 to 2003.

=== Literature ===
A small subplot in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;2010: Odyssey Two&quot; concerned the crew of a Russo-American spaceship, who attempted to break down boredom with a &quot;Stamp Out Russlish!!&quot; campaign. As the story went, both crews were fully fluent in each other&#x27;s languages, to the point that they found themselves crossing over languages in mid-conversation, or even simply speaking the other language even when there was no-one who had it as their native tongue present. Robert Heinlein’s novel &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; is written in the heavily Russian-influenced English (much Russian vocabulary, some Russian grammar) of a joint Australian/Russian penal colony on the Moon.

=== A Clockwork Orange ===
The 1962 novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by Anthony Burgess is partially written in a Russian-influenced argot called &quot;Nadsat&quot;, which takes its name from the Russian suffix that is equivalent to &#x27;-teen&#x27; in English. The language in the novel is a secret, used as boundary separating the teen world from the adult. There are multiple examples of the words used by teenagers in the novel:

* droog - друг - friend;
* ooko - ухо - ear;
* oomny - умный - smart;
* oozhassny - ужасный - horrible/awful;
* oozy - цепь (узы) - chain/bond;
* osoosh - осушать/вытирать - drain/wipe;
* otchkies – очки - glasses.
* korova - корова - cow (found in the movie version)
* moloko+ - молоко плюс - milk plus (found in the movie version)

Even though &quot;Nadsat&quot; is a fictional constructed language that is very different from Runglish, it exemplifies a common usage of a slang combining the English and Russian languages.

==Examples==
Word formation in Runglish have some specific features:

# Loan translation or calque, i.e. a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. For example: аккаунт (account - учетная запись), брифинг (briefing – информационное совещание), трафик (traffic – дорожное движение), спичрайтер (speechwriter – составитель текстовых речей), мануал (User&#x27;s manual - инструкция по применению), адаптер (adapter – переходник), коннектор (connector – соединитель, &quot;soyedinitel&quot;), cплиттер (splitter – разветвитель, &quot;razvetvitel&quot;)
# Borrowing of English abbreviations &quot;as if those were words&quot;: АСАП (ASAP – “as soon as possible” - как можно быстрее), ИМХО (IMHO – “in my humble opinion” – по моему скромному мнению), бтв (BTW – &quot;by the way&quot; – если что), ЛЭД (LED – light-emitting diode; in Russian: светодиод, &quot;svyetodiod&quot;) etc.
# Confusion of languages in phrases like that: забукать номер в отеле (to book – зарезервировать), зачекиниться в аэропорту (to check in – зарегистрироваться);
# Hybrids, i.e. words formed by joining the foreign roots of Russian suffixes, prefixes and endings, for example: 
:&quot;юз&quot;ать (to &quot;use&quot; - использовать), 
:за&quot;френд&quot;ить (to be&quot;friend&quot;), 
:по&quot;фикс&quot;ить (to &quot;fix&quot; - исправить), 
:по&quot;шер&quot;ить (to &quot;share&quot; – делиться), 
:про&quot;чекап&quot;ить (to &quot;check up&quot; - проверить);

Linguists have highlighted the following spheres, where Runglish is actively used:

# Designation of new activities and professions, e.g. «мерчендайзер» (merchandiser), «фрилансер» (freelancer), «менеджер» (manager), «супервайзер» (supervisor), «ютубер» (YouTuber);
# Designation of new areas of human knowledge: «блог» (blog), «пиар» (PR), «промоушн» (promotion);
# Designation of items: «лэптоп»/«ноутбук» (laptop), «мэйкап» (make-up), «постер» (poster), «чипы» (microchips), «чипсы» (potato chips); «Джейсэм» (GSM cell-phone network)
# Designation of terms to give them prestige: «джоб-оффер» (&quot;job offer&quot;), «cателлит» (&quot;satellite&quot;, as in &quot;satellite city&quot;);
# Designation of musical genres: «транс» (trance), «фолк» (folk), «рэп» (rap), «эмбиент» (ambient), «ар-эн-би» (R&#x27;n&#x27;B), «фьюжн» (fusion jazz), «лаунж» (lounge music), «дип хаус» (deep house).

Some Russian brands use an English name to imply some &quot;Western&quot;, Occidental concept used.
* &quot;Fix Price&quot; convenience stores are a prime example of this logic. The store chain initially introduced the &quot;everything costs X rubles&quot; concept of fixed price (similar to the &quot;Everything 99 cents&quot; stores or the &quot;Dollar tree&quot;).

== Runglish as Russians&#x27; lish ==

Runglish has some peculiarities which distinguish it from regular English. That&#x27;s because Russian language is a synthetic language: words in Russian use various morphemes, which depend on grammatical cases, declensions and some other traits; while, as a rule of thumb, every letter in Russian has its own only sound.

* Runglish speakers hardly make any distinction between closed/open and long/short vowels (examples: &quot;heat&quot; vs &quot;hit&quot;; &quot;port&quot; vs &quot;pot&quot;). 
* Consonants/soundless at the end of words may be confused (&quot;leave&quot; vs &quot;leaf&quot;). 
* Absence of /θ/ and /ð/ in Russian phonology causes mispronunciations (examples: &quot;thing&quot; vs &quot;sing&quot;; &quot;then&quot; vs &quot;zen&quot;)
* &quot;Runglish&quot; fail to differentiate articles (&quot;а&quot; or &quot;an&quot; vs &quot;the&quot; vs zero article), as articles aren&#x27;t used in Russian grammar.
* Tenses are broken in the lish, as instead of 12 tenses (3 simple tenses, 3 continuous tenses, 3 perfect tenses, 3 perfect-continuous tenses), Russian language only has 3 tenses (past, present, future).
** Russian language has &quot;forms&quot; instead. A verb in Russian has either perfective or imperfective aspect. Still, it is challenging for a Russian to master the difference between a simple tense and its perfect tense counterpart.
* Some prepositions are mixed up in Runglish (&quot;during&quot; vs &quot;for&quot;, &quot;in&quot; vs &quot;at&quot;/&quot;оn&quot;). 
* It is very common for Runglish speakers to misuse double negation. (&quot;I didn&#x27;t do &quot;nothing&quot;&quot; (instead of &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything&quot;); and use wrong tags (&quot;You don&#x27;t like it, do you?&quot; - Runglisher may ambiguously answer &quot;Yes, I don&#x27;t&quot; / &quot;No, I like it&quot;).
* G and J may be confused in Runglish speech: programmers in Russia would often pronounce &quot;Git&quot; as &quot;Jit&quot;, confusing it with another &quot;JIT&quot; - Just-in-time compilation technology. Another example: GSM abbreviation in Runglish sounds as &quot;Jay Sam&quot;.
* The pronunciation of the letter R varies between many languages, and Russian is no exception: in Russian, the typical sound would be alveolar trill (like in Italian, Spanish or traditional Scottish English). Conversely, English &quot;R&quot; may be hard to interpret for a Russian as &quot;r&quot; and not a &quot;v/w&quot; sound if any (&quot;horn&quot; vs &quot;hone&quot;). 

=== Transliteration-related speech issues ===
Words &quot;bat&quot;/&quot;bad&quot;/&quot;bet&quot;/&quot;bed&quot; are especially difficult for native Russian speakers to tell apart. Those words would be transliterated as &quot;бэт, бэд, бет, бед&quot; respectively. 
* A/E letters and D/T letters can be confusing for a Russian. The &quot;T&quot; sound in English sounds softer, compared to the Russian way to say &quot;T&quot;; while it&#x27;s the other way round for &quot;D&quot;. Therefore, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot; may be confused in Runglish. In fact, words like &quot;card&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; can be found in Russian &quot;&quot;карта&quot; and &quot;стандарт&quot;&quot;.
* The [ Æ ] diphthong (as in &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;bat&quot;) can be a problem. While Russian language has &quot;Я&quot; letter with its sound, close to &quot;æ&quot;; the letter is almost never used to transcribe that sound. Russians transliterate &quot;&quot;and&quot; the same way they transliterate &quot;end&quot;&quot;: &quot;Энд&quot;. 
** Instead most words with &quot;-ia&quot;, are transliterated as &quot;-ия&quot;. Older example: malaria and &quot;малярия&quot;, recent example: Costa Concordia was immediately transliterated as &quot;Коста Конкордия&quot;.
** There is no strict &quot;A with [Æ] sound in English word&quot; gives &quot;Э&quot; with &quot;eh&quot; in the resulting word&quot; rule, though. In some words (e.g. &quot;caliber&quot;/&quot;calorie&quot;/&quot;bar&quot;/&quot;plastic&quot;/&quot;card&quot;/&quot;standard&quot;/&quot;bank&quot;), Russian language replaces the &quot;Æ&quot;-like sounds with &quot;cyrillic А&quot; letter and &quot;ɐ&quot; sound.
** Only the English words that end with &quot;-ar&quot; or &quot;-arity&quot;, are introduced into Russian with &quot;-яр&quot; or &quot;-ярность&quot; respectively. This goes to the words like &quot;singularity&quot; and &quot;polarity&quot;, which can be found in Russian as &quot;сингулярность&quot; and &quot;полярность&quot; respectively. 

Incidentally, there are &quot;krem&quot; and &quot;lin&quot; words in Runglish. Both words illustrate the issues with &quot;-ea-&quot;.
* Words &quot;cream&quot; and &quot;cram&quot; are homonyms in Runglish: &quot;Крем&quot;, &quot;krem&quot; word may refer both to creamy goods and (sometimes) to crammed second-hand clothing.
* Meanwhile, word &quot;lean&quot; is borrowed as &quot;Лин&quot;, &quot;lin&quot;: corporate terms like &quot;Lean Thinking&quot; would be translated to Russian as &quot;Мышление Лин&quot;. As result, the &quot;lean&quot; word is presented as an Oriental name, rather than an Occidental noun.

Trademark example: Marlboro brand is known in Russia as &quot;Мальборо&quot; without the &quot;r&quot; (and with a soundless &quot;softness sign&quot;). On the contrary, a would-be letter-for-letter &quot;Марлборо&quot; transliteration (with aforementioned alveolar trill from Cyrillic &quot;р&quot;) would have an extra syllable.

=== Simple past/present/future tenses ===
Runglish has improper use of simple tenses (&quot;X did Y&quot;) in place of &quot;perfect&quot; ones (&quot;X have done Y&quot;). 
* In Russian language verbs have &quot;forms&quot; instead; &quot;imperfect form&quot; (imperfective aspect) or &quot;perfect form&quot; (perfective aspect). The idea of &quot;perfect&quot; form of a verb is used in Russian language on situations &quot;simple&quot; tenses in English cover (I did X = Я &quot;сделал&quot; Х); while any &quot;imperfect&quot; verb would be often used in situations English speaker would use &quot;continuous&quot; form (I was doing X = Я делал Х)

=== Misused negation ===

:&quot;We don&#x27;t need no education&quot; line implies possible misused double negation (the additional &quot;no&quot; in place of &quot;any&quot;). Yet in Runglish, the &quot;no&quot; would be felt as an &quot;additional&quot; negation, ruining the play on words. 
* Compare to Russian: «Нам не нужно никакого образования».

Thing is, Russian language lacks a short word, similar to English &quot;any&quot;. Russian has similes &quot;какого-либо&quot; or &quot;какого бы то ни было&quot; - phrases, which are closer to &quot;whichever&quot;.

=== Silent letters ===
In Russian language, words don&#x27;t normally have &quot;regular&quot; letters for voiceless sounds (like the &quot;e&quot; in words like &quot;dice&quot; or &quot;prone&quot;); it may be challenging to learn proper pronunciation since the very idea of &quot;silencing&quot; letters may feel foreign to a person from Russia.
The exception of &quot;designated&quot; letters Ь (soft sign) and Ъ (hard sign)) only confirmates the general rule, as these two letters are straight-up &quot;soundless&quot;, &quot;signs&quot; and serve special roles.

=== Historically defined spelling ===

In Russian, it&#x27;s vanishingly rare to mix letters to represent one complex sound, where 2 &quot;usual&quot; letters form a double-tone, let alone 3-4 letters would be used for 1 sound; a combination of those may look misleading to a Russian. Normally, Russians only use Й letter next to a vowel to form anything similar to a diphthong.
A basic example: the double &quot;O&quot; between &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; as in &quot;flood&quot; or &quot;blood&quot; as opposed to the double &quot;O&quot; as in &quot;book&quot;, &quot;crook&quot;, &quot;zoomer&quot;, &quot;doomer&quot; or &quot;boomer&quot;.
* Russian netizens use word &quot;flood&quot; as &quot;флуд&quot; (transcribes as &quot;flud&quot;)
A complex example: Borscht word (with &quot;sch&quot; + &quot;t&quot; due to borrowing the word from Yiddish (באָרשט), and not from a Slavic language directly).

=== Overly &quot;official&quot; vocabulary ===
The lish may fail to feel neutral to native English speakers, since many words, widely used in Russian in regular talk, can be perceived as official-styled: say, along with &quot;Беречь еду&quot; (&quot;to save food&quot;) phrase, Russians would use &quot;&quot;Экономить&quot; еду&quot; (to &quot;economy&quot; food). However, the &quot;рацион&quot; word in Russian is not similar to English &quot;rations&quot; noun or English &quot;to ration&quot; verb; it is closer to a &quot;diet&quot; noun.

==== Different meanings of similar &quot;official-sounding&quot; words ====
Such day-to-day use of &quot;officially sounding&quot; borrowed words instead of words native for Russian language is often called out by Russians as &quot;канцелярит&quot; (&quot;kan-tsee-lya-rit&quot;), basically, language people from offices would &quot;get infected with&quot;. Runglishers use word &quot;observe&quot; instead of &quot;follow&quot; regarding adhering to rules sometimes. This is related to a similarity in Russian: &quot;Соблюдай&quot; (&quot;Sobludai&quot;) word for adhering to rules has the same root as &quot;Наблюдай&quot; (&quot;Nabludai&quot;), which indeed means observing.

* The very word &quot;канцелярия&quot; refers to chancery workers (e.g. office workers) in general rather than chancellors only. Therefore, the &quot;канцелярит&quot; joke term may be loosely translated as &quot;office worker&#x27;s soreness&quot; or &quot;office-&quot;itis&quot;&quot;.

== Runglish in Russia ==
With increased globalization after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, English has made its way into the languages used in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other former Soviet states. Runglish is used to talk about politics, economics, and other areas of modern life, often appearing in Russian-language news articles and headlines. English is considered more prestigious, and English loanwords may be used to demonstrate one&#x27;s level of education and involvement in the global community.

Young people are major contributors to the popularization of Runglish. Anglicisms аre an essential part of the youth vocabulary, and are becoming increasingly fixed within the language. Despite this, some Russians feel that it is important to preserve the framework of rules of the Russian language.

== Criticism ==
The opinions of linguists on the effects of Runglish are divided. Whether some argue that incorporation of foreign words into Russian language enriches it and broadens the culture, others claim that &quot;the large-scale penetration of English is destroying the system of the Russian language, its identity and culture&quot;.

In 2006, Vladimir Putin signed the decree &quot;On holding a year of the Russian language&quot;. Following that, 2007 had been declared the &quot;Year of the Russian Language&quot; in Russia and abroad, in order to promote the importance and beauty of Russian and limit the usage of foreign words. The rector of A. Pushkin State Institute of the Russian Language Yuri Prokhorov admitted that it was impossible to stop the tendency of the widespread use of foreign terms. However, he believed that the bigger issue was that a large number of Russians could not use their own language correctly.

=== Redundancy ===
In the 21st century, words for basic items are often borrowed from English even when corresponding words already exist in Russian. The English word &quot;hoodie&quot; is copied by Russian clothing shops as &quot;худи&quot; despite there being a Russian word for the same item: &quot;tolstovka&quot; or &quot;tolstovka s kapushonom&quot;. Another example is a piece of clothing to wear around one&#x27;s neck: there is the word &quot;manishka&quot; in Russian, yet modern resellers of imported clothing use the English word &quot;snood&quot; instead, making it hard to find a &quot;manishka&quot; in a Russian online store. 

In some cases English borrowings are gaining popularity over older loanwords from other Western European languages. For example, the English word &quot;sandwich&quot; competes with the German word &quot;butterbrot&quot; in Russian: an open sandwich would normally be a &quot;бутерброд&quot; in Russian, unless it is a small one, a canapé (&quot;канапе&quot;).

<text>Dudh Koshi (दुधकोशी नदी, &quot;Milk-Koshi River&quot;) is a river in eastern Nepal. It is the highest river in terms of elevation. Dudh Koshi originates from the glacier lakes at the height of 5,100 meters above sea level and meets Sapta Koshi at the altitude of 1,245 meters. 

==Koshi river system==
The Kosi River, or Sapt Koshi, drains eastern Nepal. It is known as Sapta Koshi because of the seven rivers which join together in east-central Nepal to form this river. The main rivers forming the Sapta Koshi River system are – the Sun Koshi (सुन कोशी)], the Indravati River (इन्द्रावती), the tama Koshi (तामा कोशी), the Dudh Koshi (दुध कोशी), the Arun River (अरुण), Tamor River (तमोर) and Likhu River. The Dudh Kosi river originates from the high-altitude areas of Mount Everest (8848 metres) and the snow and glacier melt contributes significant portion of streamflow, especially during the dry season. The combined river flows through the Chatra Gorge in a southerly direction to emerge from the hills.

==Course==
The river drains the Mount Everest massif, the highest peak in the world. It begins just east of Gokyo Lakes and flows south to Namche Bazaar. Continuing south, the Dudh Koshi exits Sagarmatha National Park and passes to the west of Lukla. The Lamding Khola joins the Dudh Koshi to the southwest of Surkya and continues its southerly course to Harkapur, where it joins the Sun Kosi.

== Paddling ==

The river is characteristic of extreme white water and normally cannot be used for watersports. The descent is over 5% and there are rapids that reach WW VI difficulty (not yet rated by AWA) and places that need to be portaged even with the best equipment. In addition, the river often changes — big stones getting moved around by natural forces etc.

Flowing down from Mount Everest, the river is believed to be the highest navigable whitewater. As such, it came to the attention of teams participating in the world cup since Austrian paddlers made a world record descending from 3,200 m altitude in France. Czechoslovak sportsmen then agreed to take up the challenge. A team of sixteen men, including fourteen Czechs and two Slovaks, had been gathered and on 4 January 1973 they set on the journey from Děhylov by cars (notably using customized Tatra 138 that had to survive over 30,000 km forth and back). For the last part from Lukla to Pheriche, 110 porters were hired to carry the boats and other equipment. The actual river trip began on 1 April near Pheriche at 4,243 mamsl and ran for 126 km down to Sun Kosi. The paddlers used both covered tandem canoes (C2) of Vertex brand and solo kayaks (K1), all made of fiberglass. The expedition returned home safely in August the same year.

Three years later, in 1976, there was a British expedition of seven kayakers under the leadership of Mike Jones. They used 4 metres long fiberglass slalom-style kayaks specially designed by Pyranha Canoes with extra buoyancy and reinforcement. The expedition is notable for taking place in September to avoid ice and when the water was high to set new altitude record. They paddled at approximately 5300 mamsl on one of the lakes at the Khumbu Glacier. But the high water flow had its downside — many parts were too dangerous and had to be omitted; the result was that just two boats out of eleven survived to the end at the confluence with Sun Kosi. It is unclear which parts of the river were skipped, but the descent is generally considered incomplete. The next year, HTV documentary movie &quot;Dudh Kosi: Relentless River of Everest&quot;&lt;ref name=Dickinson&gt;has been released which is a source of common misconception that this was the first trip on the river.

Note that both expeditions didn&#x27;t embark on Dudh Kosi but rather on Lobuche which is the river formed by the Khumbu Glacier and which runs around Pheriche. Just below Pheriche it merges with Imja Khola which then runs for about ten kilometres before it joins Dudh Kosi under Tengboche.

Since then, there were many expeditions using wide variety of boat constructions allowing to run some rapids that had to be portaged previously. However the access to upper parts above Lukla is now limited due to stricter regulations in and around national parks.

<doc id="992842" wikidata="Q2942473" url="?curid=992842" title="St John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint John the Evangelist is the cathedral of the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong Island, and mother church to the Province of Hong Kong and Macao. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Hong Kong and the Bishop of Hong Kong Island.

At Garden Road, Central, the cathedral is located in a prime central position, surrounded by the Bank of China Tower, Cheung Kong Center, HSBC Main Building, Court of Final Appeal Building, Former Central Government Offices, and the Former French Mission Building.

St John&#x27;s Cathedral is one of the five cathedrals in Hong Kong. The others are Holy Trinity Cathedral (Anglican), All Saints’ Cathedral (Anglican), St Luke Orthodox Cathedral (Eastern Orthodox), and the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Roman Catholic).

==History==
The congregation that would become the cathedral held its first Sunday service on Sunday, 11 March 1849, as &quot;Hongkong Colonial Chapel&quot;, the founding church of the Diocese of Victoria. It was consecrated as St John&#x27;s Cathedral by George Smith, bishop of Victoria, in 1852.

On the morning of 8 December 1941, the day after their attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the Japanese attacked Hong Kong. On Christmas morning 1941 Alaric Rose took the morning service in St John&#x27;s with a congregation of one hundred, while shelling continued on the island.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the cathedral was converted into a club for the Japanese. Many of the original fittings were stripped out, including the original stained glass windows, which had been created by William Morris&#x27; firm.

On 9 September 1945, the first service after the arrival of the Royal Navy was held in the cathedral.

In 1981, Peter Kwong became the first Chinese bishop of Hong Kong, who went on to become the first archbishop of Hong Kong when the province was established in 1998.

The site of St John&#x27;s Cathedral is the only freehold land in Hong Kong, granted in fee simple pursuant to s. 6(1) of the Church of England Trust Ordinance (Cap. 1014) of 1930. All other land tenure in Hong Kong is leasehold in nature.

On 5 June 2012, there was a service of thanksgiving at the cathedral in honour of the diamond jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Architecture==
It is the oldest surviving Western ecclesiastical building in Hong Kong, and the oldest Anglican church in the Far East.

The cathedral&#x27;s architectural style is a plain, unadorned adaptation of 13th-century English and decorated Gothic, which was the popular revivalist style for churches at the time. Along the north wall is a memorial tablet to William Thornton Bate, who was killed in the battle on Canton in 1857. A similar tablet is found at St Ann&#x27;s Church in Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire.

The bell tower of the cathedral is decorated with a large &quot;VR&quot; on the west face, in commemoration of the institution&#x27;s founding during the reign of Queen Victoria. The north and south faces of the tower are decorated with the coats-of-arms of two former governors of Hong Kong, John Francis Davis and George Bonham.

There were reports that the main doors of the cathedral are made with wood planks salvaged from , but according to a 2016 article published by the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, that is untrue.

The first pew on the south side of the interior bears the royal arms, as it was formerly reserved for the governor or any member of the royal family visiting Hong Kong before the handover in 1997.

It was declared a monument of Hong Kong in 1996.

==War memorial==
Next to the cathedral is a large memorial cross, unveiled by governor Reginald Edward Stubbs in 1921 in memory of the soldiers killed in the First World War. During the Japanese occupation the cross was reduced to a straight granite column. In 1952 it was replaced by a Celtic cross, with an inscription added to commemorate those who had died in both world wars. The original bronze tablet with the names of the First World War dead is held inside the cathedral, in St Michael&#x27;s Chapel.

Every year ex-British Army members hold a memorial service at the memorial cross.

Beside the memorial cross is a tombstone covering the remains of Ronald Douglas Maxwell, who was killed in Wan Chai three days before the ceasefire. This is the only grave within the cathedral precinct, and is registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

<doc id="992844" wikidata="Q1268261" url="?curid=992844" title="Royal Thai General System of Transcription">
<text>The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system for rendering Thai words in the Latin alphabet. It was published by the Royal Institute of Thailand in early 1917, when Thailand was called Siam.

It is used in road signs and government publications and is the closest method to a standard of transcription for Thai, but its use, even by the government, is inconsistent. The system is almost identical to the one that is defined by ISO 11940-2.

==Features==
Prominent features of the system are:
*It uses only unmodified letters from the Latin alphabet without diacritics.
*It spells all vowels and diphthongs with vowel letters: , , , , .
**Single letters , , , , are monophthongs (simple vowels), with the same value as in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
** Digraphs with trailing are monophthongs; , , sound like respectively.
**Digraphs and trigraphs with trailing , , are diphthongs and indicate IPA respectively.
* It uses consonants as in IPA except as follows:
**Digraphs with (, , ) are aspirated consonants to distinguish them from unaspirated , , .
**It uses for , as in English.
**It uses for and , somewhat like English.
**It uses for , as in English.

Final consonants are transcribed according to pronunciation, not Thai orthography.

Vowels are transcribed in the position in the word where they are pronounced, not as in Thai orthography. Implied vowels, which are not written in Thai orthography, are transcribed as pronounced.

A hyphen is used to avoid ambiguity in syllable separation before a succeeding syllable that starts with a vowel and before if the preceding syllable ends with a vowel.

Transcribed words are written with spaces between them although there are no spaces in Thai. For example, &quot;Institute of Thai Studies&quot; is transcribed as . However, compounds and names of persons are written without spaces between words. For example, (from + , &quot;scout&quot;) is transcribed as , not , and , the first and last names of a person, is transcribed as , not .

==Transcription table==
For consonants, the transcriptions are given for both initial and final position in the syllable. For vowels, a dash (&quot;–&quot;) indicates the relative position of the vowel&#x27;s initial consonant.

==History==
There have been four versions of the RTGS, those promulgated in 1932, 1939, 1968 and 1999. The general system was issued by the Ministry of Public Instruction in 1932, and subsequent issues have been issued by the Royal Institute of Thailand.

===Table of changes===


===1932 version===
The general system was set up by a committee of the Ministry of Public Instruction on the following principles:
# The general system should be expandable to the precise system.
# The general system should be based on pronunciation, and one sound should be represented by one symbol or letter.
# The general system should be in consonance with the principles of Thai grammar, orthography, and pronunciation.
# In selecting symbols or letters, account should be taken of existing types for printing and typewriting and of existing systems of transcription.

The committee considered that for the general system, tone and quantity marks were unneeded. They would be provided for the precise system. The marks are accents above the vowels, one reason that the vowel symbols used to have no marks above them.

===1939 version===
The 1939 issue allowed short vowels to be marked with a breve (˘) where expedient. By contrast, the ALA-LC transliteration uses the 1939 version with the addition of a macron (¯) for long vowels and a spiritus asper (ʽ) to transliterate อ as a consonant.

The changes in vowel notation copied existing usage (æ, œ)
and IPA notation (æ, ǫ).

===Relationship to precise system===
The precise system was issued along with the general system in 1939. A transliteration in the precise system could be converted to the general system by doing the following:
# Removing parenthesised character
# Replacing &quot;ʽ&quot; and &quot;hʽ&quot; by &quot;h&quot;
# Removing length and tone markings
# Removing &quot;ḥ&quot;, which corresponds to ะ , which may be viewed as a length mark
# Removing the character distinguishing dots below and primes
# Changing &quot;ay&quot; and &quot;aiy&quot; to &quot;ai&quot; except before vowels
# Changing &quot;č&quot; to &quot;čh&quot;
# Changing &quot;ie&quot; to &quot;ia&quot;, &quot;uo&quot; to &quot;ua&quot; and &quot;ưœ&quot; to &quot;ưa&quot;

The last set of changes removes a graphic distinction between vowels in closed syllables and vowels in open syllables.

The &quot;h&quot; is added to &quot;č&quot; in the general system to make it easier to read. When the diacritic was subsequently removed, the &quot;h&quot; was justified as avoiding the misreading of the transliteration as or rather than the correct .

===1968 version===
The 1968 version removed diacritics, including the horn of &quot;ư&quot; and replaced the ligatures &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; by &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot;. While that is more suitable as the standard transliteration for maps, it removed the contrast between the transcriptions of จ and ช , อึ and อุ , เอือ and อัว , and โอ and ออ .

===1999 version===
The 1999 version restored the distinction between the transcriptions of the pairs อึ and อุ and เอือ and อัว . It also simplified the transliteration of final ว , which now is always transcribed &lt;o&gt;.

===Allowed variants===
The following variants have been allowed:
==Criticism==
The system does not transcribe all features of Thai phonology. Particularly it has the following shortcomings:
* It does not record tones.
* It does not differentiate between short and long vowels.
* The notation does not differentiate between IPA and IPA (see table below). Using for would have been more consistent with the other stops and is used as such in ISO 11940-2.
* The notation does not differentiate between IPA and IPA (see table below).

The original design envisioned the general system to give broad details of pronunciation, and the precise system to supplement that with vowel lengths, tones, and specific Thai characters used. The ambiguity of and was introduced in the 1968 version.

<doc id="992862" wikidata="Q7063054" url="?curid=992862" title="Notions (Winchester College)">
<text>Notions are the specialised terms and customs used by pupils of Winchester College. Some are specific to the school; others are survivals of slang or dialect that were once in wider usage. Notions tests were formerly held in each house of the school, and numerous manuscript and printed books were written to collect notions for pupils to learn. Some notions were customs, such as the &quot;Morning Hills&quot; assembly held on top of St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill; others were humorous, like the &quot;Pempe&quot;, a practical joke played on new pupils. Most notions have now fallen into disuse.

== Definition ==

A &quot;notion&quot; is &quot;any word, custom, person or place peculiarly known to Wykehamists&quot;, pupils of Winchester College.
The notions in use have continually changed; even in 1891, the Old Wykehamist Robert Wrench noted that some had vanished through neglect or had become obsolete as circumstances had changed. The earliest notions book, circa 1840, contained some 350 notions; around 1000 current and obsolete notions were listed by 1900. Most of these fell into disuse in the 20th century, so that by 1980, the number of notions in use was according to the former headmaster of Winchester College James Sabben-Clare &quot;really quite small&quot;.

== Notions books ==

Notions were traditionally recorded in manuscript books for the use of &quot;new men,&quot; pupils joining the school. Many old examples of such manuscript notions books are preserved by Winchester College. Among them are books by R. Gordon (1842); F. Fane (1843); Thomson (c. 1855); J. A. Fort (1874); A. L. Royds (1867); and A. H. S. Cripps (1868–72). Printed versions are Wrench&#x27;s &quot;Word Book&quot; and &quot;Three Beetleites&quot;. The latter was long considered authoritative.

The fullest book of College notions (as opposed to Commoners notions) is that by Charles Stevens. This book is unusual in that it reflects the usages of the 1920s, when the author was at school, but was continually revised by the author from a scholarly point of view and typed out in the 1960s. It was edited by Christopher Stray and printed in 1998. Other manuscript books are those of Steadman (1955), Foster (c. 1969), Tabbush (1973–4) and Gay (1974). These were generally kept by whatever senior man was most interested in notions, and circulated shortly before Notions Examinā in each year. In the late 1980s this was formalized, and the custodian was known as &quot;Keeper of the Notions and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sutton Scotney&quot;.

A slim brochure, containing only the most basic notions in common use, is printed by P &amp; G Wells and used to be distributed to new men. In earlier times this was available for sale, but was confined to Commoner notions (as recorded in &quot;Three Beetleites&quot;) and never seen in College.

==Etymologies==

=== Winchester-specific ===


Winchester College notions are not all specific to the school, but have a variety of origins. Clearly specific are some of the names of places or objects inside the school, such as &quot;Gunner&#x27;s Hole&quot; for the old swimming-place on the river, or &quot;Moab&quot; for the washing-place in College, from the passage in &quot;Moab is my wash-pot&quot;.

There are, too, some quite specific notions based on school customs. &quot;College Men&quot; are pupils with scholarships, living in the school&#x27;s medieval buildings, while &quot;s&quot; are all the rest. For his first few weeks as a &quot;Jun Man&quot; (junior pupil), a Commoner has a &quot; (pronounced and sometimes written &quot;) while a College Man has a &quot;Pater&quot; (Latin for &quot;father&quot;): a Middle Part (second year) Man appointed to look after his &quot;Protégé&quot; (from French) or, in College, &quot;Filius&quot; (Latin for &quot;son&quot;).
A &quot;&quot; is the upright wooden stall with a seat and cupboard where a pupil works and keeps his books; it is said to derive from Old French &quot;toise&quot;, &quot;&quot;, for the original width of a Toys. From this comes &quot;Toytime&quot;, evening homework or prep.

=== Shared ===

A few notions have historically been shared with other schools: for instance Eton once used words like &quot;div&quot; (class or form) and &quot;poser&quot; (examiner, as used in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer), and Radley uses &quot;don&quot; for teacher. Some are common words used in a particular sense, like &quot;Man&quot;, which at Winchester means a pupil of any age. Other are derived from common usages, such as &quot;to mug up&quot; which has a dictionary meaning of &quot;to study intensively&quot;; the notion &quot;to mug&quot; just means &quot;to work&quot;; hence &quot;&quot;, the room in every house (not including College) surrounded by rows of &quot;Toys&quot; cubicles where pupils work. &quot;To mug&quot; also means to bestow pains upon (something), like &quot;to muzz&quot; at Westminster School.

The importance given to notions at Winchester caused them to be recorded carefully over a long period, so that compared to schools like Westminster or Eton which had similarly rich and old traditions, Winchester&#x27;s notions are now uniquely accessible to scholars, who have begun to examine them both as words and as the customs of &quot;an institution notoriously eccentric even within living memory and almost unimaginably so before the reforms of 1867&quot;.

=== Vowel-modifications ===

Many notions were formed by vowel-modification, a widespread practice in the 19th century; thus &quot;crockets&quot; is the notion for the playground game of French cricket, while &quot;Bogle&quot; or &quot;bogwheel&quot; is a modification of &quot;bicycle&quot;.

=== Slang and dialect ===

Other forms derive from slang, such as &quot;ekker&quot; (exercise), using the common speech ending &quot;-er&quot;; others again were once dialectal forms, such as &quot;brum&quot; for penniless, from Kentish dialect &quot;brumpt&quot; (bankrupt). Wrench suggests that &quot;Lob[ster]&quot; for &quot;to cry&quot; may come from Hampshire dialect &quot;louster&quot;, to make an unpleasant noise.

=== Survivals from Latin, Old English and Middle English ===

Some notions, such as &quot;foricas&quot; (toilet) and &quot;licet/non-licet&quot; (permissible/forbidden) are straightforwardly Latin terms.

A few are derived from Old English: &quot;brock&quot; (to bully) is ultimately from Old English &quot;broc&quot;, badger, which &quot;Three Beetleites&quot; suggests survived by way of northern dialect &quot;brock&quot; (badger) and the bullying sport of badger-baiting. &quot;Swink&quot; (to work hard) is a survival from Old English &quot;swincan&quot; (Middle English &quot;swynke&quot;), with the same meaning, while &quot;Cud&quot;, meaning pretty, derives ultimately from Old English &quot;cuð&quot;, via northern dialect &quot;couth&quot; or &quot;cooth&quot;.

Other notions are from Middle English: a &quot;scob&quot;, a type of chest used as a desk in College, is a Middle English word derived from Latin &quot;scabellum&quot;, French &quot;Escabeau&quot;, while &quot;thoke&quot; (a rest, an idle time), meant &quot;soft, flabby&quot; in the 15th century.

=== Abbreviations ===

Several notions were created by abbreviating words, as in &quot;Div&quot; (from &quot;Division of the School&quot;), for class or form. Such notions could be assembled into phrases – for example, the &quot;Dons&#x27; Common Room Notice Board&quot; became &quot;Do Co Ro No Bo&quot;. Abbreviations are often indicated by a colon, as in 18th-century handwriting, for example &quot;Sen: Co: Prae:&quot; (Senior Commoner Prefect); some end with a long vowel, indicated with a macron, for example &quot;competī&quot;, &quot;mathmā&quot; and &quot;examinā&quot; (for &quot;competition&quot;, &quot;mathematics&quot;, and &quot;examinations&quot; respectively). There were slight differences of vocabulary between College Men and Commoners.

=== Folk etymologies ===

Some notions acquired a folk etymology:

*&quot;Remedy&quot; and &quot;Half-remedy&quot; (usually shortened to &quot;rem&quot; and &quot;half-rem&quot;), meaning a day or a half-day holiday respectively, was formerly supposed to be derived from &quot;dies remissionis&quot; (holiday), anglicised as &quot;remi day&quot;. Its actual origin is Latin &quot;remedium&quot;, rest or refreshment.
*&quot;Firk&quot;, to expel, is derived straightforwardly from Old English &quot;fercian&quot;, via Middle English &quot;fferke&quot;. A folk etymology from Latin &quot;furca&quot;, &quot;[pitch]fork&quot;, gave rise to a legend that expelled pupils had their clothes handed to them through the gate by Old Mill on a pitchfork.

== As customs ==

An example of a custom which is a notion is &quot;Morning Hills&quot;, when the whole school gets up early in the morning, once a year, to meet on the top of St. Catherine&#x27;s Hill, a nearby hill belonging to the college. It used to be the only time that the whole school regularly assembles together; a former headmaster, James Sabben-Clare, wrote that each year, the head explained this fact &quot;to disbelieving parents of first-year boys&quot;. However, as of September 2022 and the admission of day pupils in the 6th form, attendance is only compulsory for boarding pupils.

A &quot;bad notion&quot; was a custom that was not permitted to pupils in a certain group; for instance, in 1901 it was a bad notion for a pupil who had been at the school for less than four years to wear a speckled straw hat.

== Notions tests ==

=== Annual event ===

&quot;Notions examinā&quot;, or latterly just &quot;Notions&quot;, used to be an annual event in each house, including College. It was held after the first two weeks of the autumn term, and was designed to test new boys&#x27; familiarity with the manners and customs of the school. In College, it was accompanied by feasting and a ritual list of absurd formulaic questions and answers, such as

Sabben-Clare writes that the clock has no face, and doubts whether the odd-job man&#x27;s wife had a boudoir.

=== The &quot;Tunding Row&quot; ===

In 1872, under the headmaster George Ridding, &quot;tunding&quot;, beatings given by a prefect (a senior pupil), using a ground-ash across the shoulders, were still permitted. The matter became a national scandal, known as &quot;the Tunding Row&quot;, when &quot;an overzealous Senior Commoner Prefect, J.D. Whyte,&quot; beat the senior boy of Turner&#x27;s house, William Macpherson, for refusing to attend a notions test. He received &quot;thirty cuts of a ground-ash inflicted on his back and shoulders&quot;. Ridding made matters worse by trying to defend the action; the public came to understand that both the housemaster and the headmaster knew and approved of the action. The result was public outrage. Ridding &quot;less than whole-hearted[ly]&quot; limited the prefects&#x27; power to beat to twelve cuts, to be administered only on the back. Notions tests were forbidden as a &quot;disgraceful innovation&quot;. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; wrote in 1912 that &quot;The incident was trivial, but the victim&#x27;s father appealed to &quot;The Times&quot;, and an animated, though in general ill-informed, correspondence followed.&quot; Two governors resigned. The notions test however persisted, but more gently and more informally.

== The &quot;Pempe&quot; ==

The &quot;Pempe&quot; was formerly a practical joke perpetrated in Commoners. A junior boy was asked to obtain a book called &quot;Pempe ton moron proteron&quot; (Ancient Greek: , &#x27;Send the fool further&#x27;); each person he asked for it would refer him to someone else, often in a different house, until someone took pity on him. A similar joke, involving an &quot;important letter&quot; with the words &quot;send the fool further&quot;, was practised in Ireland on April Fools&#x27; Day.

The College man and natural historian Frank Buckland described his own &quot;Pempe&quot; experience of 1839:

By tradition, a notions book should not define a &quot;Pempe&quot; beyond calling it &quot;A necessity for all new men&quot;.

<text>Virtual Light is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer William Gibson, the first book in his Bridge trilogy. &quot;Virtual Light&quot; is a science-fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, cyberpunk future. The term &#x27;Virtual Light&#x27; was coined by scientist Stephen Beck to describe a form of instrumentation that produces optical sensations directly in the eye without the use of photons. The novel was a finalist nominee for a Hugo Award, and shortlisted for the Locus Award in 1994.

==Plot summary==
The plot centers around Chevette Washington, a young bicycle messenger who lives in the &quot;ad hoc&quot;, off-the-grid community that has grown on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake.

Chevette, on a whim, steals a pair of dark-rimmed glasses from a man at a party because she finds him loathsome. Soon after, she realizes that the glasses have unlikely importance, as security company henchmen begin tracking and following her. Among the pursuers are Svobodov and Orlovsky, two Russian immigrants who reside in San Francisco and are employed as cops, as well as Loveless, a ruthless corporate hitman with gold canine teeth. The glasses contain plans by a powerful corporation to rebuild San Francisco entirely using nanotechnology, and for that reason, they are highly coveted and present a danger to the person who possesses them.

Meanwhile, Berry Rydell, a former cop turned private security agent, is contracted to recover the glasses for Lucius Warbaby, an intimidating and presumably successful &quot;skip-tracer&quot;, a sort of bondsman/bounty hunter. When Rydell is given the mission, he is not informed of the significance of the glasses and the information they contain.

Eventually, the plot climaxes when Rydell, Loveless, Warbaby, Orlovsky, and Svobodov all catch up with Chevette. Rydell escapes the scene with Chevette, and they flee their enemies, who have all the advantages of wealth and technology on their side. A subplot also focuses on a romantic relationship between Chevette and Rydell.

Another subplot focuses on a Japanese sociologist named Shinya Yamazaki, who is currently studying the bridge dwellers and the history of their settlement. The subplot largely focuses on his interactions with Skinner, an old man who lives in a shack high atop one of the bridge&#x27;s support pylons, and shares this home with Chevette.

==Setting==
The setting is California in 2006, part of a dystopian world where the middle class has essentially evaporated leaving only multinational corporations and their exorbitantly rich elite and the poor who are mostly security officers, couriers, or otherwise work in minor service positions. Many of the poor live illegally and entirely outside the normal economy in places like The Bridge engaged in dubious enterprises such as theft, drugs, weapons, gambling, prostitution, and operation of unlicensed restaurants and doctor&#x27;s offices. Others pursue livelihood in innocuous yet unregulated commerce such as by running antique shops and barbershops.

==Themes==
A major theme of &quot;Virtual Light&quot; is class conflict; Warbaby and the elite are placed against Rydell and Chevette. The elite see themselves as inherently superior, and view the underclass as amoral, ruthless, and dispensable. Another important element, which is common to cyberpunk, is the idea of the power structure withholding information from the general population. The information, in this case, are the plans to rebuild an entire city completely, regardless of what its inhabitants think, reminiscent of Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris.

==Main characters==

*Chevette Washington, a bike messenger with a rough past and uncertain future; she was abused as a child by her mother&#x27;s boyfriend. At one point she was imprisoned, but escaped and was able to find a job as a courier.
*Berry Rydell, a private security officer who has drifted from one job to another ever since his killing of a suspect and subsequent lawsuit by the man&#x27;s family cost him his job as a police officer.
*Lucius Warbaby, a bounty hunter hired to retrieve the stolen glasses by the corporation that made them. He in turn hires Rydell to assist him in finding the person who stole them. Due to a recent rollerblading injury, he requires a cane to walk.
*Freddie, Warbaby&#x27;s assistant. He has a fondness for loud, bright-colored print shirts, and carries a laptop with him wherever he goes.
*Loveless, an agent sent by the company that made the glasses to retrieve them and kill whoever stole them. His most distinguishing features are his four gold canine teeth, visible at the corners of his mouth whenever he smiles.
*Sublett, one of Rydell&#x27;s fellow security guards. He is an albino with severe chemical allergies, and is a member of a Christian religious sect that views certain movies and television shows as a new form of gospel.
*Sammy Sal Dupree, Chevette&#x27;s friend who set her up with her courier job at Allied and tries to convince her to get rid of the glasses. He is presumed to be killed by Loveless halfway through the story, but it is revealed near the end that he survived.
*Skinner, an old man that Chevette lives with. She helps him around the house, and together they also sell odds and ends to people for extra money.
*Lowell, Chevette&#x27;s old boyfriend who has ties to the Republic of Desire hacking ring.
*Shinya Yamazaki, a Japanese national who describes himself as an &quot;existential sociologist&quot;, currently studying the inhabitants of The Bridge.
*Svobodov and Orlovsky, corrupt San Francisco cops who pursue Chevette in an attempt to obtain the glasses.

<text>Idoru is the second book in William Gibson&#x27;s Bridge trilogy. &quot;Idoru&quot; is a science-fiction novel set in a postmodern, dystopian, cyberpunk future. One of the main characters, Colin Laney, has a talent for identifying nodal points, analogous to Gibson&#x27;s own:

==Plot summary==
In the post-Tokyo/San Francisco earthquake world of the early 21st century, Colin Laney is referred to agents of rock and roll megastar Rez (of the musical group Lo/Rez) for a job using his peculiar talent of sifting through vast amounts of mundane data to find &quot;nodal points&quot; of particular relevance. Rez has claimed to want to marry a synthetic personality named Rei Toei, the Idoru (a Japanese virtual idol) of the title, a claim stranger than usual and therefore questioned by his loyal staff, particularly by his head of security, Keith Blackwell. Blackwell believes that someone is manipulating Rez, and wants Laney to find out who. Simultaneously, the Seattle chapter of the Lo/Rez fan club is discussing exactly the same topic of the unbelievable marriage of human and AI construct. Fourteen-year-old Chia Pet McKenzie is chosen by the group to go to Tokyo and meet with the Tokyo chapter to find out what is really happening. On the flight she meets a woman named Maryalice, who dupes her into unwittingly carrying a contraband item through customs in Tokyo.

Laney accepts his new position warily, but is conflicted throughout much of the novel by his past involvement with a powerful infotainment organization, &quot;SlitScan&quot;, which thrives on destroying media personalities by exposing their secrets. In the course of this earlier job he feels responsible for the death of an innocent party. His talent had allowed him a foreshadowing of a probable suicide, but SlitScan had tried to limit Laney&#x27;s role to passive observer. However, Laney&#x27;s conscience snapped – he attempted at the last moment to stop the suicide, but instead became mired in a scandal. Yet another organization claiming to be a media watchdog steps in and tries to pull Laney away from SlitScan to use his story to expose SlitScan&#x27;s involvement in illegal spying. This goes awry and Laney is left alone, high and dry. Further complicating Laney&#x27;s life is that Kathy Torrance, his controller from SlitScan, is attempting to blackmail him with false evidence into betraying his current employers, Lo/Rez, by exposing whatever secret she thinks they are hiding.

Chia, after being brought to the club run by Maryalice&#x27;s boyfriend Eddie, is helped to escape by one of the club&#x27;s employees who perceives that she is in danger. She takes with her the contraband which was slipped into her luggage. When she meets with the local Tokyo chapter of the Lo/Rez fan club, she is disappointed by their seeming indifference to the impending &quot;wedding&quot;, and they inform her this is merely an unfounded rumor. Disbelieving, Chia decides to investigate on her own and seeks the help of her host Mitsuko&#x27;s brother Masahiko, an otaku who is a member of the hacker community the &quot;Walled City&quot; (a virtual community based on Kowloon Walled City). Masahiko and Chia embark on a search for the truth to the marriage of Rez and Rei by going to the club where Rez announced the event, though the club no longer exists in the rapidly changing Tokyo scene. Masahiko is informed by other denizens of Walled City that he is being watched, both on the net and physically at the home of himself and his sister. Chia admits to Masahiko that she has found something in her luggage and that might be what the unknown men are seeking. The contraband turns out to be a highly illegal nanotech assembler – a device used for high-speed material fabrication – which Eddie smuggled in on behalf of the Kombinat. Chia and Masahiko go to a love hotel to try to hide from the searchers. It is there that all the parties converge. When Chia and Masahiko link into the net, the Idoru (Rei) manifests herself in Chia&#x27;s Venice simulation once she realizes Chia is playing a part in her evolution. Maryalice finds the hotel through their taxi record, letting herself into their room. Lamenting her recent breakup with Eddie over the botched smuggling operation, she tells them that giving back the device won&#x27;t stop them from being killed as witnesses.

Masahiko and Chia go onto the Net to get the help of Chia&#x27;s friend Zona Rosa (Spanish for &quot;pink zone&quot;) who claims to be the leader of a Mexico City &quot;girl gang&quot;, and from the denizens of the distributed system, Walled City. In short order, Maryalice&#x27;s boyfriend Eddie shows up with a member of the Kombinat to reclaim the nanotech device. This prompts Zona Rosa (who has been viewing events over the net) into making a terrible personal sacrifice to save Chia. Events rapidly come to a head when Rez and Blackwell arrive. Laney sees events occurring (and about to occur) in the datastreams and rushes with Lo/Rez&#x27;s support crew to the love hotel. A deal is struck, and most of the parties are accommodated. The ultimate resolution is left open as to whether the Rez/Rei union has become possible with the nanotechnology they have now obtained.

<text>The Westlink M7 is a tolled urban motorway in Sydney, New South Wales that is part of the Sydney Orbital Network. Owned by the NorthWestern Roads (NWR) Group, it connects three motorways: the M5 South-West Motorway at Prestons, the M4 Western Motorway at Eastern Creek, and the M2 Hills Motorway at Baulkham Hills.

==Route==
Westlink M7 begins at the Roden Cutler Interchange, a Y-junction with the M31 Hume Motorway and M5 South-West Motorway at Prestons, and weaves to the west of Liverpool to the junction of Elizabeth Road and Wallgrove Road in Abbotsbury. From then on it runs parallel to Wallgrove Road north towards the Great Western Highway and the Light Horse interchange, a stack junction with the M4. Continuing north, it leads to Minchinbury and follows alongside Rooty Hill Road up to Dean Park at an exit with Rooty Hill Road North and Richmond Road.

From this junction, Westlink M7 turns eastward along the preserved Castlereagh Freeway corridor through Quakers Hill and Kings Langley up to the interchange with Old Windsor Road to Norwest Business Park and continues southeast to reconcile with the existing M2 Hills Motorway in Baulkham Hills. It is 4 lanes (2 lanes each way) for its entire length.

The M7 cycleway runs parallel to Westlink M7.

===Light Horse Interchange===
The Light Horse Interchange is the junction of the M4 and M7 motorways. The stack interchange is the largest of its type in the Southern Hemisphere. It was named in honour of an Australian World War One formation, the Australian Light Horse.

== History ==
Western Sydney is the fastest growing part of the Sydney metropolitan area. Pennant Hills and Woodville Roads (signed as Ring Road 5, then as State Route 55), then later Cumberland Highway (State Route 77), were originally built as bypasses for Sydney, had instead become primary arteries through the western suburbs.

In the late 1980s, with the intended construction of a BHP steel mill in Rooty Hill, Blacktown City Council required BHP to construct an arterial route that allowed industrial traffic to bypass the Rooty Hill CBD and the newly opened Davis Overpass. A two-lane road named Phillip Parkway was constructed between Woodstock Avenue and Eastern Road and opened to traffic in July 1992. The alignment of Phillip Parkway would eventually be the preferred alignment of the Western Sydney Orbital two years later in 1994.

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Western Sydney had become the third-biggest producer of Australia&#x27;s GDP, after the Sydney CBD and Melbourne. The growth of industrial and residential areas brought about a massive increase in traffic on its local roads. This led to the planning of the Western Sydney Orbital, which, among its original purposes, was to serve the stillborn second international airport at Badgerys Creek.

In January 2001 the federal government made a commitment to progressively contribute A$356 million to the Western Sydney Orbital project, with the remaining A$1.5 billion required for the design and construction provided by the private sector. Planning approval was given by the NSW Minister for Planning in February 2002. The project was renamed Westlink M7 in July 2003.

The motorway was privately funded through an innovative construction contract method known as a “deed” to facilitate the expedition of the tendering phase; several deeds were drawn up based on the contractors proposals. The deed was for the full design, construction, operation and maintenance of the motorway including more than of continuously reinforced concrete (CRCP) and asphalt roads, upgrading of local roads, the longest free-flowing (no toll booths) toll road in the world at the time. More than 90 bridges (of four different types) and the largest shared path network in the Southern Hemisphere. The design, construct, operate and maintain contract worth at least A$2.0 billion was awarded to WSO (Western Sydney Orbital Pty Ltd) by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority. The design and construct portion of the contract valued at A$1.8 billion was awarded to a joint venture between Abigroup and Leighton Contractors (ALJV) with design work undertaken by a further joint venture by Maunsell AECOM and SMEC (Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation) with further subcontracting to other designers (Arup) and independent verification by Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM).

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority (later Transport for NSW) declared the Western Sydney Orbital as Tollway 6009, from its interchange with M2 Hills Motorway in Seven Hills to the interchange with the M5 South-West Motorway in Prestons, on 7 January 2003, nearly two years before it had officially opened. Now known as Westlink M7, the tollway still retains this declaration.

The motorway was opened to traffic on 16 December 2005, eight months ahead of schedule. WSO (commonly known as Westlink) operate the motorway with maintenance subcontracted to Westlink Services and tolling to ROAM. With its opening, Metroad 7 between Liverpool and Beecroft was transferred from Cumberland Highway to Westlink M7. Westlink M7 was the first Sydney motorway to be marked with an alphanumeric shield (M7) rather than the hexagonal Metroad shield.

On 25 December 2005, just 9 days after opening, the motorway suffered its first fatality: a 12-year-old boy died at Cecil Park when the four-wheel drive he was travelling in rolled down an embankment and onto Elizabeth Drive, almost crushing another car.

In 2020, WSO – then already a business of the NorthWestern Roads Group – submitted an unsolicited proposal to the NSW government to widen the M7 and construct the M7 and M12 Motorway interchange simultaneously. This was aimed to reduce the disruption to M7 traffic and provide project delivery efficiencies for the M7–M12 interchange. In August 2020, the proposal has moved to Stage 2 of the process with further progression to Stage 3 in May 2022.

==Tolls==
===Ownership===
When first incorporated, WSO Co. Pty Limited (commonly known as Westlink) was a consortium owned by Transurban (40%), Macquarie Investment Group (MIG) (40%), Leighton (10%) and Abigroup (10%). The consortium was awarded the bid to develop Westlink M7 in October 2002, and entered into a 34-year concession period on 14 February 2003. Leighton and Abigroup were the contractors for the construction of M7.

When the M7 opened in December 2005, Transurban and MIG purchased an additional 5%
equity interest in Westlink M7 from Leighton and Abigroup. Subsequently, in 2006-2007, Abigroup sold its stake to Transurban and MIG, with the latter two having a 47.5% shareholding each and Leighton having a 5% shareholding.

In August 2008, Transurban and MIG exercised their pre-emptive rights and acquired Leighton&#x27;s 5% stake equally, increasing their shareholding to 50% each. In December 2008, MIG announced it would sell its 50% stake of Westlink to Western Sydney Road Group (WSRG), of which MIG owned 50% and Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) owning the other 50%. Transurban had the pre-emptive right to acquire MIG&#x27;s share, but declined in January 2009 due to its high price. The sale to WSRG proceeded, and QIC and MIG each had 25% ownership of Westlink.

MIG was later restructured into Intoll and then acquired by the CPP Investment Board in December 2010. Since then, the Westlink M7 is owned by Transurban (50%), QIC (25%) and CPP (25%). In 2015, Westlink was reorganised under a new umbrella entity, NorthWestern Roads Group (NWR), with no changes in ownership. The NWR Group would also deliver and now tolls and operates the NorthConnex, opened in October 2020.

The 34-year concession to construct, operate and toll the M7 was originally due to expire on 14 February 2037. However, the concession was extended as part of the NorthConnex agreement between NWR and the NSW government and will expire in June 2048 instead.

=== Pricing ===
The Westlink was built as a fully tolled, gateless motorway employing electronic payment, with an initial toll-free period that ended on 15 January 2006. The toll for a car or motorcycle was originally 29.91 cents per kilometre, capped after at $5.98. On 1 April 2006, this increased to 30.07 cents per kilometre, capped after at $6.01.

Tolls are adjusted quarterly according to the CPI and heavy vehicle tolls are three times the toll for a car and motorcycle.

<text>The Bridge trilogy is a series of novels by William Gibson, his second after the successful Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy comprises the novels &quot;Virtual Light&quot; (1993), &quot;Idoru&quot; (1996) and &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; (1999). A short story, &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Room&quot;, was originally composed for &quot;Visionary San Francisco&quot;, a 1990 museum exhibition exploring the future of San Francisco.

==Setting==
The first book of the Bridge trilogy is set in an imaginary 2006, with the subsequent books set a few years later. The books deal with the race to control the beginnings of cyberspace technology and are set on the United States&#x27; West coast in a post-earthquake California (divided into the separate states of NoCal and SoCal), as well as a post-earthquake Tokyo, Japan, that had been rebuilt using nanotechnology.

The trilogy derives its name from the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, because in the trilogy it was abandoned in an earthquake and has become a massive shantytown and site of improvised shelter. The bridge is a pivotal location in &quot;Virtual Light&quot; and &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;. 

Characters in each novel interact in a cyberspace construct of Kowloon Walled City, which is initially described as an inverted kill file. The walled city shares a number of features with the bridge itself, including an emphasis on self-governance and efficiency in user-construction.

==Characters==
The novels of the Bridge trilogy loosely share a common cast of characters. Former police officer Berry Rydell and bicycle courier Chevette Washington occupy central roles in the first and third novels. Researcher Colin Laney, who has a mysterious ability to identify patterns in vast tracts of information, appears in &quot;Idoru&quot; and &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;. Other recurring characters include Rei Toei, an AI pop star, and Shinya Yamazaki, an existential sociologist.

==Critical reception and influence==
Canadian Poet Douglas Barbour said of the trilogy that it &quot;has all the stylistic verve of his earlier work, but it asks some tougher questions, explores character more deeply, and savagely interrogates our star-obsessed society.&quot; &quot;Virtual Light&quot;, the first novel in the series, was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1994.

<text>The .30-06 Springfield cartridge (pronounced &quot;thirty-aught-six&quot; ), 7.62×63mm in metric notation, and called the .30 Gov&#x27;t &#x27;06 by Winchester, was introduced to the United States Army in 1906 and later standardized; it remained in military use until the late 1970s. In the cartridge&#x27;s name, &quot;.30&quot; refers to the nominal caliber of the bullet in inches; &quot;06&quot; refers to the year the cartridge was adopted, 1906. It replaced the .30-03 Springfield, 6mm Lee Navy, and .30-40 Krag cartridges. The .30-06 remained the U.S. Army&#x27;s primary rifle and machine gun cartridge for nearly 50 years before being replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO and 5.56×45mm NATO, both of which remain in current U.S. and NATO service. The cartridge remains a very popular sporting round, with ammunition produced by all major manufacturers.

==History==
In the early-1890s, the U.S. military adopted the smokeless powder .30-40 Krag rimmed cartridge. The 1894 version of that cartridge used a round-nose bullet. Around 1901, the U.S. started developing an experimental rimless cartridge for a Mauser action with a box magazine. That led to the 1903 .30-03 Springfield rimless service round that used the same round-nose bullet as the Krag. The .30-03 achieved a muzzle velocity of .

Many European militaries at the beginning of the 20th century were adopting lighter-weight (roughly ), higher velocity, service rounds with pointed (spitzer) bullets: France in 1898 (8×50mmR Lebel &quot;Balle D&quot; spitzer with boat-tail), Germany in 1903 (7.92×57mm Mauser &quot;S Patrone&quot;), Russia in 1908 (7.62×54mmR &quot;Lyokhkaya pulya&quot; [light bullet]), and Britain in 1910 (.303 British Mark VII ). Consequently, the round-nosed U.S. .30-03 service cartridge was falling behind.

===Cartridge, ball, caliber .30, Model of 1906 (M1906)===
For these reasons, the U.S. military developed a new, lighter cartridge in 1906, the .30-06 Springfield, &quot;cartridge, ball, caliber .30, Model of 1906&quot;, or just &quot;M1906&quot;. The .30-03 case was modified to have a slightly shorter neck to fire a spitzer flat-based bullet that had a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.405, a muzzle velocity of , and a muzzle energy of . The cartridge was loaded with military rifle (MR) 21 propellant, and its maximum range was claimed (falsely) to be . The M1903 Springfield rifle, which had been introduced alongside the .30-03 cartridge, was modified to accept the new .30-06 Springfield cartridge. Modifications to the rifle included shortening the barrel at its breech and resizing the chamber, so that the more tapered bullet would not have to jump too far to reach the rifling. Other changes to the rifle included the elimination of the troublesome &quot;rod bayonet&quot; of the earlier Springfield rifles.

The M1906 maximum range was originally overstated. When the M1906 cartridge was developed, the range tests had been done to only ; distances beyond that were estimated, but the estimate for extreme range was incorrect by almost 40 percent. The range discrepancy became evident during World War I. Before the widespread employment of light mortars and artillery, long-range machine gun &quot;barrage&quot; or indirect fires were considered important in U.S. infantry tactics. When the U.S. entered World War I, it did not have many machine guns, so it acquired British and French machine guns. When those weapons were later replaced with U.S. machine guns firing the M1906 round, the effective range of the barrage was 50 percent less. Firing tests performed around 1918 at Borden Brook Reservoir (Massachusetts), Miami, and Daytona Beach showed the actual maximum range of the M1906 cartridge to be . Germany, which was using the &quot;S Patrone&quot; (S ball cartridge) loaded with a similar flat-based bullet in its rifles, had apparently confronted and solved the same problem by developing an aerodynamically more refined bullet for long-range machine gun use. The &quot;s.S. Patrone&quot; was introduced in 1914 and used a &quot;s.S. – schweres Spitzgeschoß&quot; (heavy spitzer) boat-tail bullet which had a maximum range of approximately .

===.30 M1 ball cartridge===
For these reasons, in 1926, the ordnance corps, after extensive testing of 7.5×55mm Swiss GP11 projectiles provided by the Swiss, developed the .30 M1 ball cartridge loaded with a new improved military rifle (IMR) 1185 propellant and bullet with a 9° boat-tail and an ogive of 7 calibers nose cone that had a higher ballistic coefficient of roughly 0.494 (G1 BC), that achieved a muzzle velocity of and muzzle energy of . This bullet further reduced air resistance in flight, resulting in less rapid downrange deceleration, less lateral drift caused by crosswinds, and significantly greater supersonic and maximum effective range from machine guns and rifles alike. Additionally, a gilding metal jacket was developed that all but eliminated the metal fouling that plagued the earlier M1906 cartridge.
The loaded round weighed and its maximum range was approximately . The maximum average pressure (MAP) was . The average target radius was specified to be not greater than at and not greater than at when fired from a Mann accuracy weapon.

===Cartridge, caliber .30, ball, M2===
Wartime surplus totaled over two billion rounds of ammunition. Army regulations called for training use of the oldest ammunition first. As a result, the older .30-06 ammunition was expended for training; stocks of .30 M1 ball ammunition were allowed to slowly grow until all of the older M1906 ammunition had been fired. By 1936, it was discovered that the maximum range of the .30 M1 ball ammunition with its boat-tailed spitzer bullets was beyond the safety limitations of many military firing ranges. An emergency order was made to manufacture quantities of ammunition that matched the external ballistics of the earlier M1906 cartridge as soon as possible. A new cartridge was developed in 1938 that was essentially a duplicate of the old M1906 round, but loaded with IMR 4895 propellant and a new flat-based bullet that had a gilding metal jacket and a different lead alloy, and weighed instead of . This 1938 pattern cartridge, the cartridge, caliber .30, ball, M2, achieved a muzzle velocity of and muzzle energy of . The loaded round weighed and its maximum range was approximately . The MAP was by copper crusher (equivalent to the SAAMI CUP unit). The average target radius was specified to be not greater than at and not greater than at .

==Firearms==

In military service, the .30-06 was used in the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle, the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle, the semi-automatic M1941 Johnson rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, and its last major use was during the Vietnam War.

The Belgian army (ABL) bought the FN Model 1949 rifle in .30-06 caliber (both as a sniper version with telescopic sights and as a general service weapon). The Belgian armed forces used the round widely in the Korean war, where the .30-06 caliber FN-49 proved to be a superior weapon in terms of both accuracy and reliability to the American M1 Garand. The .30-06 FN-49 saw widespread use in the various wars in and around the Belgian Congo. The 30-06 FN-49 was also sold to the armies of Luxembourg, Indonesia, and Colombia. Another customer was Brazil where it served the navy.

Large volumes of surplus brass made it the basis for dozens of commercial and wildcat cartridges, as well as being extensively used for reloading. In 1908 the Model 1895 Winchester lever-action rifle became the first commercially-produced sporting rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield. It is still a very common round for hunting and is suitable for large game such as bison, Sambar deer, and bear, when used at close to medium ranges.

In 1903, the Army converted its M1900 Gatling guns in .30 Army to fit the new .30-03 cartridge as the M1903. The later M1903-&#x27;06 was an M1903 converted to .30-06. This conversion was principally carried out at the Army&#x27;s Springfield Armory arsenal repair shops. All models of Gatling guns were declared obsolete by the U.S. Army in 1911, after 45 years of service.

With &quot;hot&quot; handloads and a rifle capable of handling them, the .30-06 is capable of performance rivaling many magnum cartridges. However, when loaded more closely to the original government specs, .30-06 remains within the upper limit of felt recoil most shooters consider tolerable over multiple rounds, unlike the magnums, and is not unnecessarily destructive of meat on game such as deer. With appropriate loads, it is suitable for any small or large heavy game found in North America. The .30-06&#x27;s power and versatility (combined with the availability of surplus firearms chambered for it and demand for commercial ammunition) have kept the round as one of the most popular for hunting in North America.

==Performance==
The .30-06 cartridge was designed when shots of were expected. In 1906, the original M1906 .30-06 cartridge consisted of a , flat-base cupronickel-jacketed-bullet. After World War I, the U.S. military needed better long-range performance machine guns. Based on weapons performance reports from Europe, a streamlined, boattail, gilding-metal bullet was used. The .30-06 cartridge, with the bullet was called &quot;cartridge, .30, M1 ball&quot;. The .30-06 cartridge was far more powerful than the smaller Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge and comparable to the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka. The new M1 ammunition proved to be significantly more accurate than the M1906 round.
In 1938, the unstained, , flat-base bullet combined with the .30-06 case became the M2 ball cartridge. The M2 ball specifications required minimum velocity, measured from the muzzle. M2 ball was the standard-issue ammunition for military rifles and machine guns until it was replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO round in 1954. For rifle use, M2 ball ammunition proved to be less accurate than the earlier M1 cartridge; even with match rifles, a target group of diameter at using the M2 bullet was considered optimal, and many rifles did not perform nearly as well. The U.S. Marine Corps retained stocks of M1 ammunition for use by snipers and trained marksmen throughout the Solomon Islands campaign in the early years of the war.

In an effort to increase accuracy, some snipers resorted to use of the heavier .30-06 M2 armor-piercing round, a practice that re-emerged during the Korean War. Others sought out lots of M2 ammunition produced by Denver Ordnance, which had proved to be more accurate than those produced by other wartime ammunition plants when used for sniping at long range. With regards to penetration, the M2 AP round can penetrate at least of armor steel at . A test done by Brass Fetchers shows that M2 AP can actually penetrate up to of MIL-A-12560 armor steel from a distance of . The round struck the plate at a velocity of 2,601 fps and made a complete penetration.

Commercially manufactured rifles chambered in .30-06 are popular for hunting. Current .30-06 factory ammunition varies in bullet weight from 7.1 to 14.3 grams (110 to 220 grains) in solid bullets, and as low as 3.6 grams (55 grains) with the use of a sub-caliber bullet in a sabot. Loads are available with reduced velocity and pressure as well as increased velocity and pressure for stronger firearms. The .30-06 remains one of the most popular sporting cartridges in the world. Many hunting loads have over of energy at the muzzle and use expanding bullets that can deliver rapid energy transfer to targets.

The table above shows typical muzzle velocities available in commercial 30-06 loads along with the maximum .30-06 muzzle velocities reported by several reloading manuals for common bullet weights. Hodgdon, Nosler, and Barnes report velocities for barrels. Hornady and Speer report velocities for barrels. The data are all for barrels with a twist rate of 1 turn in which is needed to stabilize the heaviest bullets. The higher muzzle velocities reported by Nosler for and heavier bullets use loads employing a slow-burning, double-base powder (Alliant Reloder 22).

The newer 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge offers similar performance to standard military .30-06 loadings in a smaller cartridge.

==Recoil==
One reason that the .30-06 has remained a popular round for so long is that the cartridge is at the upper limit of power that is tolerable to most shooters. Recoil energy (free recoil) greater than will cause most shooters to develop a serious flinch, and the recoil energy of an rifle firing a 30-06 bullet at is . Recoil-shy shooters can opt for lighter bullets, such as a bullet. In the same rifle, a bullet at will only generate of recoil energy. Young shooters can start out with even lighter bullets weighing .

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .30-06 Springfield cartridge case can hold 68.2 grains and has a volume of . The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions.

.30-06 Springfield maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters.

Americans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 = 17.5 degrees. According to the &quot;Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives&quot; (C.I.P.) the common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm (.30 in), Ø grooves = 7.82 mm (.308 in), land width = 4.49 mm (.1768 in) and the primer type is large rifle.

According to the official C.I.P. guidelines, the .30-06 Springfield case can handle up to 405 MPa (58,740 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P.-regulated countries, every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. The 8×64mm S is the closest European ballistic twin of the .30-06 Springfield.

== Sporting use ==
Although the .30-06 was designed as a military round, it soon caught the attention of big game hunters in the United States. This new cartridge offered a flatter trajectory and carried more energy than the popular .30-30 Winchester. The .30-06 also could be loaded with the then new spitzer designed projectiles, which also contributed to extending the cartridge&#x27;s performance with respect to other .30 caliber bullets fired from lever action rifles, making it easier to put venison on the table.

It is a very versatile round that may be loaded with bullets ranging from 110 to 220 grains, which may be effectively stabilized from 1:10&quot; twist barrels. Thus, the cartridge may be used to hunt animals of different sizes from varmint to moose and even brown bears with adequately constructed heavy bullets. Since the cartridge may be used for taking all North American big game species it was considered an all-round by hunters and gun writers as Jack O&#x27;Connor, who hunted extensively with it.

President Theodore Roosevelt took a .30-06 to his famous African Safari along with his son Kermit and Frederick Courteney Selous, proving that the .30-06 could bring down game of any size. Though not optimal for dangerous game, the .30-06 is adequate for hunting African plains game.

With 150-grain bullets, the .30-06 Springfield is a perfect option for medium-sized game such as deer and sheep. Leaving the muzzle at 2950 fps, it gives the hunter a maximum point blank range slightly short of 300 yards. The 165 and 168-grain bullets with higher ballistic coefficient contribute to buck cross winds more efficiently and maintain downrange energy at expense of a more curved trajectory, while loaded with 180 to 220 grains, the .30-06 is adequate for hunting larger game such as elk, moose, and even brown bears.

The .30-06 is also the parent case for many other popular hunting cartridges such as the venerable .270 Winchester, the .25-06 Remington, the .280 Remington, and the .280 Ackley Improved. All of them are balanced, flat-shooting cartridges ranking high among the most popular big game hunting cartridge for mid-sized species worldwide.

Despite the new trend towards high ballistic coefficient cartridges, designed to be used with short length actions, hunters still praise the .30-06 as it still lists high on the rank of big game hunting cartridges popularity, and every major gun maker worldwide chambers it in at least one of its rifles.

== Military cartridge types ==

&quot;Note:&quot; .30-06 cartridges are produced commercially with many different bullets and to a number of different specifications.

=== United States ===
The .30-06 round was replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO round in 1954. However, it remained in limited use in the army reserves and national guard for some time; Frankford Arsenal only stopped production in 1961, and Lake City Army Ammunition Plant was making .30-06 until the late 1970s, with new production batches in 1993 and 2002. 
The &quot;T&quot; (Trials) designation is the code number it had when it was under development and testing. The &quot;M&quot; (Model) designation is the number it received when it was made standard-issue. Issued bullets before 1934 used the year of adoption as their model number. 


* Armor-piercing, M1917: The M1917 was the first service-issue armor-piercing rifle ammunition used by the US Army. It had a steel core in a lead envelope with a partial cupro-nickel jacket which had an exposed soft tip. The exposed tip was designed to aid in the envelope peeling away on impact to allow the core to strike the target. It had the unintended effect of making the thin lead envelope an expanding bullet. Since expanding bullets were seen as violating the Hague Convention it did not see service in World War I.
* Armor-piercing, M1918: The M1918 was similar to the armor-piercing M1917 round except it had a smooth cannelure near the case-mouth and had a full-metal-jacketed bullet. It replaced the AP M1917 round in service.
* Armor-piercing, M1922 (&quot;1922–1934&quot;): This was a redesigned armor-piercing round with a heavier steel core. It was the first armor-piercing round to have a black-painted bullet tip. 
* Armor-piercing, M1 (&quot;1934–1939&quot;): This was a higher-velocity (3,180 fps) AP round that was under development throughout its service. It was replaced in 1939 by the AP M2, a redesign of the AP M1922. 
* Armor piercing, M2 (&quot;1939–1954&quot;): This cartridge is used against lightly armored vehicles, protective shelters, and personnel, and can be identified by its black bullet tip. Bullet is flat base, weight 163–168 grains. Defense against the M2 projectile by name is one of the performance standards for Type IV body armor. 
* Armor-piercing incendiary, T15/M14 (&quot;1943–?&quot;) and M14A1 (?-1954): This cartridge may be substituted for the M2 armor-piercing round and is normally employed against flammable targets. The tip of the M14 bullet is colored with a blue tip over a black ring. The M14A1 featured an improved core design and incendiary charge and had a silver-colored aluminum-painted tip.
* Ball, M1906 (&quot;1906–1925&quot;): This cartridge is used against personnel and unarmored targets and can be identified by its silver-colored cupro-nickel alloy bullet jacket. The M1906 has a projectile and flat base. Its jacket was found to quickly foul the bore.
* Ball, M1 (&quot;1925–1937&quot;): The M1 has an , 9-degree boat-tailed projectile designed for aerodynamic efficiency. Though it had a lower initial velocity, velocity and energy were greater at longer ranges due to its efficient shape. The harder bullet was made of seven parts lead to one part antimony. The jacket material was changed to gilding metal (an alloy of 95% copper and 5% zinc) to reduce fouling.
* Ball, M2 (&quot;1937–1954&quot;): With a bullet based on the profile of the M1906, this cartridge incorporated the gilding-metal jacket of the M1 projectile combined with a slightly heavier, pure-lead core. It had a higher muzzle velocity than either of the earlier cartridges.
* Ball, M2 alternate (&quot;1943–1945&quot;): A wartime economy variant of the ball M2 that used a steel full metal jacket coated with gilding metal to conserve copper and tin.
* Blank, M1906: This cartridge is used to simulate rifle fire. It is derived from the M1903 blank, but with a resized neck. It has a paper bullet that contains a tiny black powder charge to aid in breaking it up. 
* Blank, M1909: This cartridge is used to simulate rifle fire. The cartridge is identified by having no bullet, having a cannelure in the neck of the case, and the crimp is sealed by red lacquer. This is still a current cartridge for ceremonial M1 Garands. Modern M1909 blanks are rose-crimped, but they have the same designation.

* Dummy, M40: This cartridge is used for training. The cartridge case has six longitudinal corrugations and there is no primer.
* Explosive, T99: Development of a cartridge that contained a small explosive charge that more effectively marked its impact. Often referred to as an &quot;observation explosive&quot; cartridge, it was meant to designate line-of-sight targets for cannon. The T99 was never adopted.
* Frangible, T44/M22 (&quot;April 1945&quot;): The bullet disintegrates upon striking a hard or armored target, leaving a pencil-like mark to indicate a hit during bomber aerial gunnery practice. The bullet is identified by a green tip over a white ring.
* Gallery practice M1919 / Guard M1: A reduced-charge Ball cartridge with a 140-grain wax-coated lead round-nosed bullet used for target shooting at indoor facilities or near built-up areas. It was later renamed the &quot;Guard M1&quot; in 1933 and was used for guard and sentry duty at defense plants and military installations during World War II. 
* Guard M1906 (&quot;1907–1918&quot;): A reduced-charge ball cartridge with a 150-grain FMJ pointed-nose bullet used for guard and sentry duty in built-up areas. The cartridge was originally marked with six cannelures in the middle, but this weakened the case and caused it to burst in a dirty rifle. It was later marked by six dents or flutes on the shoulder of the cartridge. Although production stopped in 1918, there were plenty of stocks of the oddball round left until the 1920s. 
* High-pressure test, M1: The cartridge is used to proof test 30-06 rifles and machine guns after manufacture, test, or repair. The cartridge is identified by stannic-stained (silvered) cartridge case loaded to a pressure of .
* Incendiary, M1917: Early incendiary cartridge, bullet had a large cavity in the nose to allow the material to more easily shoot forward on impact. As a result, the M1917 had a tendency to expand on impact. The M1917 had a blackened tip.
* Incendiary, M1918: Variant of the M1917 with a normal bullet profile to comply with international laws regarding open-tipped expanding bullets.
* Incendiary, M1: This cartridge is used against unarmored, flammable targets. The tip of the bullet is painted blue.
* Match, M72: This cartridge is used in marksmanship competitions, and can be identified by the word &quot;MATCH&quot; on the headstamp. Ammunition lots loaded for use in specific competitions have been headstamped NM (National Match), IM (International Match), PM or P (Palma Match), and I &amp; P (International and Palma Matches). 
* Rifle Grenade blank, VB (&quot;?-1933&quot;): These cartridges were designed to launch the Viven-Bessières rifle grenade. The VB rifle grenade was initiated when a Ball bullet passed through it. The Rifle Grenade Blank had a wooden bullet so it could have a reduced danger space when fired. It was used with inert Training/Practice grenades at training ranges that were near built-up areas. It had a &quot;VB&quot; headstamp to indicate its use. 
* Rifle Grenade blank cartridges, M1 (&quot;1933–1945&quot;), M2 (&quot;1941&quot;), M3 (&quot;1941–1953&quot;), and M3E1 (&quot;1953–present&quot;): These cartridges are used in conjunction with the M7 series of rifle grenade launchers to propel rifle grenades. Blank cartridges utilize a full-size brass case and carry only a powder charge. M1, M2, and M3 blanks are sealed at the case-mouth with a red wad and the M3E1 is crimped. The differences between the three cartridges have to do with the powder charge and the range of grenade launchers. The M1 was a universal blank and rifle grenade cartridge that replaced the specialized rifle grenade (RG), chemical rifle grenade (CRG), and chemical warfare grenade (CWG) cartridges and was used with cup-discharger rifle grenade launchers. The M2 was an experimental cartridge used as a testbed; it used a propellant mixture of black powder and smokeless powder because it was feared that the smokeless powder would not reliably ignite by itself. The M3 was designed to be used with the M1 series (for the M1903 Springfield rifle), M2 series (for the M1917 Enfield rifle), and M7 series (for the M1 Garand rifle) spigot grenade launchers and used a propellant that was a mixture of five grains of FFFG black powder and 40 grains of IMR-4895 smokeless powder. The M3E1 featured an extended case neck, a rosepetal crimp, and a full smokeless powder loading and was designed for use with the M7A3 spigot rifle grenade launcher and larger ENERGA rifle grenade. The grenade blanks were issued in double-rowed 10-round cartons, usually as part of a set with the hermetically-sealed metal M13 &quot;grenade launcher assortment&quot; ammo can.
* Tracer, M1: Tracer for observing fire, signaling, target designation, and incendiary purposes. The M1 has a red tip.
* Tracer, M2: Tracer for observing fire, signaling, target designation, and incendiary purposes. Has a short burn time. The M2 originally had a white tip, but then switched to a red tip like the M1. This was due to the similar purpose of both rounds. 
* Tracer, M2 alternate (&quot;1943–1945&quot;): A wartime economy variant of the tracer M2 that used a steel full metal jacket coated with gilding metal. It was ballistically matched to the ball M2 alternate.
* Tracer, T10/M25: Improved tracer over M1 &amp; M2. Designed to be less intense in terms of brightness than either the M1 or M2 tracers. The M25 had an orange tip.

===Commonwealth===
The .30-06 (or &quot;caliber .30&quot;) cartridge was adopted in 1940 during the beginnings of the Lend-Lease program in anticipation of using American weapons in front-line service. The British used American-made ammunition during the war, which was designated as &quot;cartridge S.A, .30&quot; to avoid confusing it with their own .303 British service round. It was used after the war as belted machinegun ammunition by the Royal Armored Corps and was not declared obsolete until October, 1993. The &quot;z&quot; after the numeral indicates that it used a nitrocellulose propellant rather than cordite. Marks of ammunition were originally designated with Roman numerals (i.e., .303 Ball Mark VII), but were replaced with Arabic numerals by 1945 (i.e., .303 Ball MK 7).
* Cartridge S.A, .30 ball MK Iz: This was the War Ministry&#x27;s designation for the 172-grain .30-06 Ball M1 round. It was not accepted for use in service, as the American military had already marked it as limited standard. 
* Cartridge S.A, .30 ball MK IIz: This was the War Ministry&#x27;s designation for the 150-grain .30-06 Ball M2 round. Lend-Lease ammo made for the British government had no mark designation and was headstamped &quot;.300z&quot;. 
* Cartridge S.A, .30 ball MK 3z: This was the designation for an experimental round designed in 1945 for Royal Navy use that was based on the .30-06 ball M2. It was not adopted for service. 
* Cartridge S.A, .30 ball MK 4z: This is a boat-tailed cartridge with a 150-grain full metal jacketed bullet. It is marked with a purple annulus. It was normally packed in 20-round cartons. However, Commonwealth countries that used the M1 Garand (like Pakistan) bundled it in 16-round cartons that contained two preloaded 8-round Mannlicher-style en-bloc clips.
* Cartridge S.A, .30 ball MK 5z: This was made under contract by Fabrique Nationale in the 1970s. 
* Cartridge S.A, tracer .30 inch G Mark 1z: This is a boat-tailed cartridge with a 150-grain full metal jacketed bullet and a Berdan primer. It is marked with a red annulus and has a headstamp of &quot;.30 G1z&quot;.
* Cartridge S.A, tracer .30 inch G Mark 2z: This was made under contract by Fabrique Nationale in the 1970s and is paired with .30 ball MK 5z. It is the same as the &quot;G Mark 1z&quot;, except it has a non-corrosive Berdan primer. It is marked with a red bullet tip and has a headstamp of &quot;.30 G2z&quot;.
* Cartridge S.A., incendiary .30 inch B Mark Iz: US-made incendiary M1 cartridges.
* Cartridge S.A., incendiary .30 inch B Mark IIz: UK-made incendiary M1 cartridges. 
* Cartridge S.A., drill .30 inch Mark I: This was the War Ministry&#x27;s designation for the US dummy M40 round. It had green paint on its flutes.
* Cartridge S.A., drill .30 inch Mark II: US dummy M40 round made by the UK from used US .30-06 cases. It had a recapped headstamp, ball or AP bullet over a wooden dowel, and red paint on its flutes.
* Cartridge S.A., drill .30 inch Mark III: Training cartridge made by the Indian Army. Although described and specified in a 1945 ammunition manual, no copies have been discovered.
* Cartridge S.A., drill .30 inch Mark IV:
* Cartridge S.A., drill .30 inch Mark 5:

===French Union===
The .30-06 round was adopted in 1949 for use in American war surplus military aid weapons like the M1 Garand and M1919 medium machinegun. Military production was from the 1950s to the mid-1960s, while export production to French Union nations lasted until the late 1980s. Cartridge cases were softer than US specifications to prohibit their being recovered and reloaded by insurgents. 
* 7.62mm Modele 1949 Cartouche à Balle Ordinaire: This cartridge was based on the USGI .30-06 ball M2 (alternate) round. It had a cupro-nickel- or gilding-metal-clad steel jacket with either a brass or lacquered Parkerized steel case with a Berdan primer.
* 7.62mm Modele 1951 Cartouche à blanc pour Fusil: This blank cartridge has a papier-mâché bullet for training use in rifles. The bullet is painted green to tell it apart from regular ammo.
* 7.62mm Modele 1951 Cartouche à blanc pour Fusil-Mitrailleur: This blank cartridge has a wooden bullet for training use in machineguns. The bullet is painted or tinted blue to tell it apart from regular ammo.
* 7.62mm Modele 1952 Cartouche à blanc: This blank cartridge has a lacquered Parkerized steel case and is sealed by a blue cardboard disc at the case mouth.

<doc id="992876" wikidata="Q2344574" url="?curid=992876" title="Stephen Bronner">
<text>Stephen Eric Bronner (born 19 August 1949) is a political scientist and philosopher, Board of Governors Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States, and is the Director of Global Relations for the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights. Bronner has published over 25 books and 200 journal articles.

==Early life and education==
Born in New York City, New York, United States on 19 August 1949, Bronner earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) at City College of New York, spent a year at the Universität Tübingen in Germany on a Fulbright-Hays Fellowship in 1973, and completed his Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1976.

==Career==
Bronner has been employed at Rutgers University since 1976, and has held visiting professor positions at the New School for Social Research (1989), and the Universität Leipzig (1998).

Bronner is Director of Global Relations at the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, and the Executive Chair of US Academics for Peace and an advisor to Conscience International. His activities in civic diplomacy led him to audiences with presidents and high ranking political dignitaries in Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Sudan, Darfur, Ukraine, and Russia. Some of these experiences are discussed in his books dealing with the internal politics of these nations in &quot;Blood in the Sand&quot; (2005), &quot;Peace out of Reach&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Bitter Taste of Hope&quot; (2017). Invitations to speak at universities and conferences all over the United States, Japan, China and South Africa have been numerous.

Bronner is a contributing editor at and on the editorial board of other journals. His various works include studies of contemporary political theory, political history, and cultural politics.

==Alleged sexual misconduct==
In 2018, Bronner was accused of sexual assault by several female students and colleagues. After Rutgers University reversed their decision not to investigate, they put Bronner on a paid research sabbatical until their investigation is over. Bronner claims that none of the alleged assaults happened, but stated that he understands some of his comments to women on campus over the years may have caused offense. “I admit I am not always super tactful. Some of my jokes miss the mark. But there was never any harm.” Campus officials &quot;found no proof he violated any school policies.&quot;

==Theoretical contributions==
Influenced by critical theory, existentialism, and liberal socialism, Bronner is best known for his reinterpretation of tradition and a host of concepts like the class ideal and the cosmopolitan sensibility.

==Awards and honors==

Bronner was the recipient of the MEPeace Award by the Network for Middle Eastern Politics in 2011. Along with various teaching awards, he received the Michael A. Harrington Prize for &quot;Moments of Decision&quot; (1991) and Honorable Mention for the David Easton Prize, which honored the best work of political theory of the last five years, for &quot;Reclaiming the Enlightenment&quot;. Bronner received the Charles McCoy Lifetime Achievement Prize from the American Political Science Association in 2005.

<text>Artix (; ) is a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of south-western France.

==Geography==

Artix is located some 12 km north-west of Lescar and 14 km south-east of Orthez. Access to the commune is by main road D817 from Lacq in the north-west passing through the commune and south of the town and continuing south-east to Denguin. Access to the town from the D817 is on the D280 which links the two ends of the bypass. There are also the D263 road going north to Urdès, the D663 going north-east to Serres-Sainte-Marie, the D32 going east to Cescau, and the D281 going south-east to join the D33 north-west of Noguères. The A64 autoroute also passes through the north-eastern corner with Exit 9 exiting to the D817 in the commune.

The SNCF Toulouse-Bayonne railway line also passes through the commune with Artix station just south of the town centre. The &quot;Interurban network of Pyrénées-Atlantiques&quot; busline has two routes passing through the commune: Route 801 (Orthez-Pau) and Route 802 (Artix-Pau).

Apart from the town there are the villages of Cap de Lalanne and Le Plateau. Some 40% of the commune is residential with the balance farmland with patches of forest.

The Gave de Pau flows north-west past the southern border of the commune with some branches touching the border. The &quot;Ruisseau Laulouze&quot; flows from the east through the south of the commune and joins &quot;Le Ruisseau&quot; which flows north-west parallel to the Gave de Pau until it joins the river west of the commune just south of Lacq. The Agle also flows west through the northern corner of the commune to join the Gave de Pau south of Lacq.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Artix&quot; appears in the forms: 
*&quot;Artits&quot; (1286), 
*&quot;Artics&quot; (13th century, Fors de Béarn), 
*&quot;Artidz&quot; (1350, Notaries of Pardies), 
*&quot;Artitz&quot; (1385, Census of Béarn), 
*&quot;Arthitz&quot; (1440, Census of Bastide-Monréjau),
*&quot;Artixs&quot; (1538, Reformation of Béarn), 
*&quot;Artix&quot; in 1583, in the Reformation of Béarn, and on the Cassini Map of 1750.

Its name in béarnais is &quot;Artics&quot;. Michel Grosclaude indicated that the name &quot;Artix&quot; possibly was formed from the mediterranean radical &quot;arte&quot; (&quot;green oak&quot; then &quot;undergrowth&quot;) and the collective and locative basque suffix &quot;-itz&quot;. He proposed them in the sense &quot;Vegetation of the undergrowth&quot;.

&quot;Laviecave&quot; is a hamlet mentioned in 1863 but Paul Raymond recommended the spelling &quot;La Vie-Cave&quot;, meaning the sunken way or path: &quot;la via cava&quot;.

==History==
The commune once had a Lay Abbey, vassal of the Viscounts of Béarn. In 1385 Artix was a small village under the bailiwick of Pau with only 10 fires grouped around the church. In 1880 the old church was demolished. The new church was opened in 1899.

The village became a city after the creation of the &quot;Royal Road&quot; under Henri IV which then became Imperial Route 117, then the Route nationale 117. This opening up allowed the market at Artix to flourish and the city to grow in importance.

===Heraldry===
==Administration==

* the Energy association of Pyrénées-Atlantiques;
* the inter-communal association for defence against flooding of the Gave de Pau;

===Twinning===
Artix has twinning associations with:
* Sacedón (Spain) since 1992.
* Song-naaba (Burkina Faso) since 1995.

==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Artisiens&quot; or &quot;Artisiennes&quot; in French.

Villages in Béarn are permitted to display street signs in Occitan. Artix was the first commune in France of more than 3,000 inhabitants to implement Bilingual signs throughout the commune in occitan (Gascon béarnais) and French. Consequently, its signs show its name as &quot;Artics&quot;, since the letter X is little used in the Bearnais dialect.

Artix also has an Occitan language school or Calandreta.

<text>Jan Louis Perkowski (December 29, 1936, Perth Amboy, New Jersey - died November 21, 2023 ) was a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of Virginia. He had three consecutive degrees including a PhD from Harvard University. He resided in Charlottesville until his death in 2023.

He attracted attention when he published research into alleged vampire folklore in the 1970s that was easily sensationalized in the press and has a vogue among vampire fans.

Perkowski wrote about a Kashubian idiolect and was employed by the National Museum of Man in Canada in 1968–9 to conduct research for the Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies in the area of Wilno, Ontario, to study Kashubian Polish folklore and traditions. His 1972 report, &quot;Vampires, Dwarves, And Witches Among The Ontario Kashubs&quot; inspired sensational articles in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, &quot;The Canadian Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; which got it denounced on the floor of the Canadian House of Commons.

Kashubians in Wilno, Ontario allegedly believe that &quot;the only remedy against this kind of future vampirism was to extract the teeth from the infants. The Kashubs also feared those born with a red caul, a piece of amniotic membrane that naturally surrounds an unborn baby in the womb.

Perkowski was previously employed at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the University of Texas, Austin, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. He taught classes on Slavic languages, diachronic linguistics, the occult and vampires, and courses such as &quot;How to be a Spy.&quot; He is now retired.

In 1989, he published &quot;The Darkling: A Treatise on Slavic Vampirism&quot; which contains original vampire accounts translated into English from over twenty languages, many for the first time, including a vampire trial in Dubrovnik in 1737. The book is currently being added as a chapter in his forthcoming work &quot;Vampire Lore&quot;. However, he was best known for teaching an undergraduate class called &quot;Dracula&quot;, covering vampire mythology in western culture from ancient times to the present. Perkowski himself approaches the vampire as an outgrowth of the culture in which its legend arose - often more a morality tale than anything else. After his retirement, the course was taken on by his former student Stanley Stepanic, a known noise musician and demonologist.

<text>Riot-E Riot Entertainment Ltd, was a Finnish media company, focused on SMS content mobile phone games that, despite 20 million euros in venture capital invested in them by corporate giants like Nokia, News Corporation and The Carlyle Group, went bankrupt within two years.

Riot Entertainment managed to create a very positive public image. It seemed as if it had everything going for it: Investors with very deep pockets, relationships with top media brands of the world, contracts with large operators, an extensive worldwide gaming network, a very dynamic public image and worldwide presence. They were possibly the first company to offer highly branded mobile games and worldwide online gaming, years before the mainstream could even dream about such services.

They spent money on refurbishing an exclusive four-storey office with gaming rooms, sauna and a theater for 50 people. They built the first games from scratch and recruited 100 people in one summer, and the almost 24/7 workforce was nourished by daily breakfasts and frequent parties.

On July 4, 2001, RIOT-E’s pay-per-download service had attracted close to 200,000 downloads of X-Men characters and images by subscribers to Japan’s Big Three operators. On July 16, 2001, Riot-E announced that it &quot;will develop interactive games for The Lord of the Rings fans and gaming communities&quot;

The creditors were out 3.2 million euros. Hewlett-Packard and IBM did not get their leasing fees, BT Ignite ended up providing broadband services without compensation, Hertz will not be getting its car leasing fees, Nokia Ventures with 25 percent ownership, and Softbank UK Ventures with 15 percent ownership had nothing to show, operators in the Philippines (Global Handyphone), Italy (Telecom Italia Mobile – TIM), Spain (Telefónica) and Finland (Radiolinja) and the landlord is missing 157,000 euros worth of rent.

The company was such a spectacular failure that it was the subject of the award-winning documentary &quot;Riot On!&quot;.

Company slogan: &quot;We don&#x27;t make games, we create riots.&quot;

<text>Roy Ernest Hay (born 12 August 1961) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the pop band Culture Club. Hay, a trained pianist since the age of five, replaced founding member Johnny Suede in 1981. Some of Hay&#x27;s musical influences were Stevie Wonder, The Isley Brothers and Led Zeppelin. Before his involvement with Culture Club, Hay was a hairdresser in his native Essex.

It was during Culture Club&#x27;s beginnings that Hay met Alison Green. The two married in 1982.

According to the &quot;Culture Club&quot; episode the VH-1 series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, Hay assisted Boy George in giving up heroin. The singer suffered the painful withdrawal symptoms closely attended by Hay in his Essex home.

Following Culture Club, Hay formed another band, called This Way Up, with singer Robinson Reid. In 1987, they released three singles: &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot; and &quot;Louise&quot;. An album, &quot;Feelin&#x27; Good About It&quot;, was released in some European countries and in Japan in 1987. Of those records, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; charted, for one week at number 72 in the UK Singles Chart.

Hay moved to Los Angeles, U.S. in 1989 and from there wrote for and produced young artists and bands for Sony Music. He branched into commercial composing and sound design with his own company Haywired Music.

Hay found later success as a composer in Hollywood, California, working with fellow composer Hans Zimmer and composing the music for a series directed by Robert Altman, as well as the music for &quot;Cracker&quot; and for Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. Hay reunited with the three original members of Culture Club in 1998 to record a new album. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Hay described the years apart as a healing process. &quot;There was obviously a bit of a healing process that needed to happen between Jon [Moss] and George. They hadn&#x27;t really spoken to each other in quite a while&quot;. The description of the tour was &quot;Older and wiser...We&#x27;ve all been through some good and bad times since the band. I think we&#x27;ve all grown up a bit&quot;.

<text>Michael Emile Craig (born 15 February 1960) is a British musician and DJ best known as the bassist of the pop/soul/new wave group Culture Club.

Craig started the group Culture Club, which became one of the most successful bands of the 1980s, selling millions of albums. In 1988, he released a solo single entitled &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, which failed to make an impact.

Craig was an executive producer in the mid-1990s for his own dance label, SLAMM records.

Craig continues to tour with Culture Club and its original members Boy George, Roy Hay, and until his departure from the group in 2021, Jon Moss. Craig has also occasionally performed with Kid Creole and the Coconuts during their UK shows.

==Personal life==
Craig went to St Clement Danes School in DuCane Road, Hammersmith. Craig had two children with Cleo Scott, daughter of the author and political campaigner Erin Pizzey: son Keita, born in 1977, and daughter Amber, born eighteen months later. Keita was a paranoid schizophrenic who committed suicide in Wandsworth Prison in 2000. Craig ended his relationship with Cleo Scott shortly after Culture Club&#x27;s rise to fame in 1982. He is now married to an Italian woman named Lilli, and they have three sons: Milo Emile, footballer Paco Gigi, and Geo Luca.

<doc id="992915" wikidata="Q190518" url="?curid=992915" title="Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg County">
<text>Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg (, ) is an administrative county (Hungarian: &quot;vármegye&quot;) in northeastern Hungary, bordering Slovakia (Košice Region), Ukraine (Zakarpattia Oblast), and Romania (Bihor and Satu Mare counties). It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Hajdú––Bihar and Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén. The capital of Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg county is Nyíregyháza.

Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg County was organised after World War II from the previous counties Szatmár–Ugocsa–Bereg and Szabolcs. Before 1991 it was called Szabolcs-Szatmár County.

==Geography==
Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg is in the northeastern tip of Hungary. It borders Ukraine (Zakarpattia Oblast), Slovakia (Košice Region), and Romania (Bihor and Satu Mare counties), and has good connections both by road and rail. Within Hungary, the county is bordered by Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén County and the Tisza River to the north-west and Hajdú–Bihar County to the south-west.

The early Hungarians transformed this region significantly by clearing large areas of forest to make way for pastures and farmland. Approximately 5 to 6 square kilometres of forest were cleared for the construction of the Szabolcs earthwork in the ninth and tenth centuries, and its ruins are still present. The area was the gateway for the Mongol invasion of Hungary in the 1240s, and suffered considerable destruction and population decrease during the raids. With the subsequent development of the country, the region became even more marginalized in the 15th century. Ongoing civil war, rebellion, and war exacted a heavy price and further hindered the region&#x27;s development.

The county&#x27;s borders have been altered frequently over the years, its current territory being established in 1950 with the amalgamation of the counties of Szabolcs–Ung and Szatmár–Bereg–Ugocsa.

There are many forests, fields, pastures, meadows, and moorland forests in the county. The bog moss moors at Csaroda, the Nyíres lake, and the Bábtava lake are especially valuable, as they contain many rare species of fauna and flora.

Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg is Hungary&#x27;s sixth-biggest county with a total land area of . From a geographical aspect, it is possible to divide the county into two main regions: The Upper Tisza Valley and the Nyírség. Tisza is one of the most important rivers of the county, entering Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg — and Hungary — at Tiszabecs, and leaving at Tiszadob. Its segment in Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county is 235 kilometres long, out of which belongs to the Upper Tisza Valley, reaching the area of Tokaj and Rakamaz. The larger area named the Nyírség is derived from the word nyír meaning birch, as the region is dominated by birch woodlands. The northern part of Nyírség is covered with sandy forest soils, the southern areas have loose wind-blown sand. Alluvial and meadow soils are found in the Upper Tisza region.

The county has a continental climate; it is cooler than the Great Plain because it is further north. Summers are cooler than in other parts of the Plains. Annual precipitation is 550–600 millimetres. The higher than average number of days of sunshine make ideal conditions for the growing of tomatoes, sunflower, tobacco, apples, and other fruits such as plums—for which the county is famous, being eaten fresh, dried into prunes (some made into lekvar) and fermented into well-known brandies.

The county has 229 settlements, of which 20 are towns. The county capital and largest city is Nyíregyháza with a population of 116,900 in 2003. The other cities have relatively small populations, only those of Kisvárda and Mátészalka having around 18,000 inhabitants. The eastern part of the county is lightly populated and is dotted with small villages which often have very poor economic conditions.

==The Tisza River==

The Upper Tisza region has many streams and rivers, but the Nyírség region has little surface water. The most important of Tisza&#x27;s tributaries is the river Szamos, which is also characterised by great variations in water volume. There are irrigation systems, a water barrage, and a hydroelectric power station on the Tisza at Tiszalök.

Lakes of various sizes have evolved in sandy areas such as the basin of the Sóstó (Salty lake) of Nyíregyháza, whose alkaline, hydrogen-carbonated waters have medicinal qualities. Many water reservoirs have been built according to local demand. Thermal waters of 55–65 °C can be brought to the surface from wells as shallow as 1,000 metres. The most important thermal water reserves are in Nyíregyháza, Kisvárda, Mátészalka, and Tiszavasvári. The county&#x27;s geothermal energy still awaits exploitation.

The county has relatively few mineral reserves. Almost all of the large energy source transport systems cross the county.

==Demographics==
In 2015, it had a population of 562,357 and the population density was 92/km².

===Ethnicity===
Besides the Hungarian majority, the main minority populations in the county are Romani (about 44,000), German (about 2,000), and Ukrainian (about 1,000).

==Regional structure==

==Economy==
The county borders three countries, and it is the only Hungarian county bordering Ukraine. The railway border crossing toward Ukraine is well developed; its high capacity is able to meet the requirements of transit and bilateral trade. Following the reconstruction of the road border crossing, the county is also able to cope with increased road transportation.

Several regions in the county have tourism potential, mostly unexploited. Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg has several agricultural products of excellent quality, with capacity for higher production. There is an abundance of low-cost, semiskilled labour.

The county&#x27;s biggest problem is the economic crisis. There is a shortage of local capital and inward investment, which restrains the creation of new jobs, thus the unemployment rate remains the second highest in Hungary. Manufacturing lags the rest of the country, most notably lacking high quality, high-value-added products. The marginal soil quality limits the scope of agricultural production to a few products which suffer from shrinking export markets to the east.

It is home to the Szakoly Power Plant.

<text>The 1920–21 NHL season was the fourth season of the National Hockey League (NHL). Four teams each played 24 games in a split season. The Quebec franchise was transferred to Hamilton, Ontario, to become the Hamilton Tigers. The Ottawa Senators won the league championship in a playoff with the Toronto St. Patricks. The Senators went on to win the Stanley Cup by defeating the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association three games to two in a best-of-five series. This would be the last split season before the NHL changed its regular season and playoff formats.

==League business==
Eddie Livingstone was again talking of creating a rival league and mentioned Hamilton
as a city in his league. To head this off, league president Frank Calder got the owners of the league to admit a Hamilton franchise. As Abso-Pure had built an arena, all owners agreed that it would be wise to
have a franchise in Hamilton. Because Quebec had done so badly the previous season, Calder said that Quebec&#x27;s players would be given to Hamilton. Although Mike Quinn was non-committal at first, he finally sold the team to Hamilton and it became the Hamilton Tigers.

==Regular season==

The Tigers had some trouble signing Joe Malone from the Quebec days, but he finally did sign. The Tigers were awarded two players from the Senators, Punch Broadbent and Sprague Cleghorn by NHL president Calder, but both refused to sign with the Tigers, and eventually returned to the Senators. Cleghorn was awarded to the Toronto St. Patricks and at first balked at the move, but did report. After the St. Patricks were defeated in the NHL playoffs, Cleghorn joined Ottawa in a deal. NHL president Frank Calder did not like this and the following season a trading deadline was instituted.

The Tigers stunned the Canadiens 5–0 in the team&#x27;s first-ever game with Babe Dye starring and Howard Lockhart getting the only shutout of his NHL career. The Toronto St. Patricks lost Corbett Denneny to injuries and recalled Dye from Hamilton, giving them Mickey Roach in his place.

Corbett Denneny scored six goals in a game January 26, 1921, helping the Toronto St. Patricks to wallop the Hamilton Tigers 10–3. Cy Denneny wasn&#x27;t about to let his brother steal the thunder and he scored six goals himself in a March 7 game as the Ottawa Senators hammered the Hamilton Tigers 12–5. For the first time, a brother combination had scored six goals in a game the same season.

Also on January 26, 1921, the Ottawa Senators left the ice with 5:13 to play in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. According to the Senators, referee Cooper Smeaton was one-sided in favour of the Canadiens. Smeaton let the Canadiens continue to play, allowing goals by Newsy Lalonde and Amos Arbour before calling the game. Smeaton denied the claim, stating &quot;a referee is always paid and receives the same salary, regardless what team wins.&quot; Smeaton would resign over the incident, but was convinced to return to refereeing later in the season. The Senators were fined $500 by NHL president Frank Calder for the incident.

The Ottawa Senators won the first half of the split season while the Toronto St. Patricks won the second half.

===Final standings===
==Playoffs==

===NHL Championship===
After the regular season, Toronto and Ottawa played a total-goals series for the O&#x27;Brien Cup and to compete for the Stanley Cup. Ottawa won by shutting out the St. Pats in both games. Ottawa then went on to play the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA.

===Stanley Cup Finals===
The five games were played in Denman Arena, Vancouver.

<doc id="992944" wikidata="Q188895" url="?curid=992944" title="Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén County">
<text>Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén (, ; ) is an administrative county (comitatus or &quot;vármegye)&quot; in north-eastern Hungary (commonly called &quot;Northern Hungary&quot;), on the border with Slovakia (Košice Region). It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Nógrád, Heves, Hajdú–Bihar and Szabolcs–Szatmár–Bereg. The capital of Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén county is Miskolc. Of the seven statistical regions of Hungary it belongs to the region Northern Hungary.

Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén is the second largest county of Hungary both by area (after Bács–Kiskun) and by population (after Pest County). It is the only Hungarian county with two UNESCO World Heritage Sites (the Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst and the Tokaj Wine Region Historic Cultural Landscape).

==Origins and meanings of name==
The county bears the name of three historic counties of Hungary, each of them was centered around a castle.

* Borsod is named after the castle to which it belonged. The castle was possibly named after its first steward, Bors (in old Hungarian language the -d suffix was a derivation suffix for place names, thus the name &quot;Borsod&quot; means &#x27;place belonging to Bors.&#x27;) The name Bors itself is of Hungarian origin, derived from the Turkish loan word &quot;bors&quot;, which means &#x27;black pepper / peppercorn&#x27; or a Slavic personal name &quot;Bor(i)š&quot;, &quot;Borša&quot;. The castle itself was a motte castle, and stood near modern-day Edelény.
* Abaúj is a shortened form of the name of its castle, &quot;Abaújvár&quot;. The &quot;Aba&quot; portion refers to the Aba clan which ruled the area in the Middle Ages, while &quot;új vár&quot; means &#x27;new castle.&#x27; The castle stood near the village of Abaújvár.
* Zemplén is named after its castle as well. The name is derived from the Slovak word &quot;zem&quot; or the Slavic &quot;zemlja&quot;, meaning &#x27;earth, soil, ground&#x27; or &#x27;country.&#x27; The castle, like its name indicates, was a motte with earthen walls; its remnants can still be seen near the Slovak village Zemplín.

Note that besides these three castles, there were other castles in the old counties which became the modern Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, such as the well-known Füzérvár.

==History==
Borsod–Abaúj–Zemplén county was created after World War II from the pre-1938 counties Borsod–Gömör–Kishont, Abaúj–Torna and Zemplén (see also: 1950 Administrative Reform in Hungary).

===From the Conquest until the Turkish occupation (900s–1526)===
The historical comitatus (Hungarian: &quot;vármegye&quot; – &quot;castle county&quot;, since each of them belonged to a castle) came into existence during the Middle Ages. Borsod county belonged to the Castle of &quot;Borsod&quot;, Abaúj belonged to the Castle of &quot;Újvár&quot; (in the modern village of Abaújvár) and Zemplén belonged to the Castle of &quot;Zemplén&quot; (today in Slovakiac

At this time the area of Borsod also included the later county Torna, and Abaúj also included the later counties Sáros and Heves. In the 12th century the former Abaúj comitatus was split into Abaúj, Heves and Sáros counties, while Torna was separated from Borsod. For the next hundreds of years the borders remained unchanged.

About two-thirds of the areas of these counties were royal property, the others were ruled by clans, for example the Miskóc clan (after whom the city of Miskolc was named). The area was inhabited mostly by castle serfs and foreign settlers (Pechenegs, Walloons, Czechs and Germans). By the 12th century more and more areas were owned by noble families and the Church. Most of Borsod was ruled by the Bors-Miskóc clan, while Abaúj was the estate of the Aba clan.

By the 14th century most of the area was owned by oligarchs. To strenghthen his rule Charles Robert waged war against them. Palatine Amadé Aba (Genus Aba) was de facto ruler of Northern Hungary. Charles Robert betrayed and defeated Amadé in the Battle of Rozgony in 1312, and also gained power over Northern Hungary.

The differences between towns and villages became important during the Anjou age of Hungary. In Borsod and Abaúj the Free Royal Town of Kassa (today&#x27;s Košice, Slovakia) and Miskolc emerged as the most important towns. The Castle of Diósgyőr had its prime under Louis the Great, it was one of the favourite residences of the royal family.

In the 16th century wine growing gained more importance. Today Tokaj-Hegyalja in Zemplén is one of the most important and famous wine districts of Hungary, home of the famous Tokay wine (named after the town Tokaj, the center of the wine district).

===From the Turkish occupation until the First World War (1526–1914)===
After the battle of Mohács, as the Turks occupied more and more of the Southern territories of Hungary, the area of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, as the northernmost part of the country, became an important area. After the Turkish occupation ended, and Hungary became part of the Habsburg monarchy, the area – because of its distance from Austria – was the main base of the resistance, and held this status until the Ausgleich (&quot;Compromise&quot;), when Hungary, formerly a mere province of the Empire, became an equal partner with Austria (1867). The family of Francis II Rákóczi (leader of the Revolution against Habsburg rule in the early 18th century) had estates here, and the revolution itself was organised from here.

The region also had cultural importance. The Reformation began spreading in Hungary in this area, and the first Protestant college was opened in Sárospatak. Many of the important persons of the Age of Enlightenment grew up in this region, for example the important politicians Lajos Kossuth, Bertalan Szemere and László Palóczy, and the language reformer Ferenc Kazinczy.

During the 18th century several towns bought their freedom from their feudal landowners. New guilds were formed, manufactures were built, mines were opened, glassworks and forges were built. Miskolc began to catch up with Kassa and take over the role as the leading city of the region, and because of this Borsod was the fastest developing county of the three counties. Many foreign settlers arrived, Slovaks, Greeks, Germans, Russians – even today there are whole villages with significant number of them. According to the census of 1787 Borsod, Abaúj and Zemplén had almost 500,000 inhabitants.

After the Ausgleich Northern Hungary – just like the other parts of the country – experienced an era of prosperity and fast development. New factories, railway lines were built, the population grew. In 1882 Abaúj county was merged with Torna, and was renamed Abaúj-Torna.

Furthermore, a large population of Jews was established during this time period. The famous film mogul who created Paramount Pictures, Adolph Zukor, was born in Ricse, a town in this county.

===From 1914 to today===
After World War I and the Treaty of Trianon Hungary had to give up its northern parts to Czechoslovakia. Abaúj-Torna had to give up 48% of its area, 72% of Zemplén became part of Czechoslovakia, only Borsod remained fully within Hungary. The neighboring county of Gömör-Kishont retained 7.5% of its area, and remaining parts were merged with Borsod. The county seats were Miskolc (Borsod-Gömör-Kishont), Szikszó (Abaúj-Torna) and Sátoraljaújhely (Zemplén).

Under the First Vienna Award, arbitrated by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy following the Munich Agreement, Hungary re-annexed territories that has been ceded to Czechoslovakia. During World War II Kassa was the capital of Abaúj-Torna. After Allied Victory in Europe, the pre-1938 borders were reinstated. The administration of the country needed to revert to pre-war status quo, since most of the land grabs proved temporary. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians remaining in Slovakia were forcibly expelled. In 1950 the Hungarian parts of the former counties Borsod-Gömör-Kishont, Abaúj-Torna and Zemplén were united, forming the county of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, with Miskolc being the county capital.

During the Socialist era the region was developed into the centre of heavy industry. Whole new towns came into existence in place of small villages (Tiszaújváros, Kazincbarcika), the industrial character of existing cities became more important (Miskolc, Ózd). Urbanization was rapid, workers from all over the country were arriving in these cities and towns, and the population of Miskolc reached its highest level in the 1980s (around 211,000). The end of the Socialist era and the recession of the 1990s hit hard, the unemployment rate is one of the highest of the country, and the local governments try to get over the crisis by strengthening the touristic potential. This seems to be a good idea, since Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén is a geographically diverse area with rich natural and cultural treasures.

==Coat of arms and flag==
The county&#x27;s coat of arms was created in 1991 from the coats of arms of the former counties now forming parts of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén. From left to right: Coat of arms of Abaúj-Torna county. – Coat of arms of Zemplén county. – Coat of arms of Borsod county. – Coat of arms of Gömör / Gömör-Kishont county (with its red background color changed to the same blue as used in the coat of arms of Abaúj).

The flag is vertically divided into two equal sections (red and blue), with the coat of arms on it, and the county&#x27;s name embroidered with gold thread under the coat of arms. Its ratio is 2:1. The use of both coat of arms and flag is regulated by the county council.

<text>Stephen Crane (1709 – July 1, 1780) was an American politician from Elizabethtown (present-day Elizabeth, New Jersey) who was a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776 and signed the Continental Association. He also served in the Provincial Congress of New Jersey, New Jersey General Assembly and New Jersey Legislative Council. Stephen did not attend the next Congress in Philadelphia as he needed to attend to divisions in his own state between East Jersey and West Jersey. He felt deeply about the taxes that Britain had imposed upon the Colonies and had made sure of his protest upon his journey to England with Matthias Hatfield.

== Biography ==
Crane was born in Elizabethtown. He served as sheriff of Essex County and was elected as a member of its town committee in 1750. He was also a judge of the court of common pleas. From 1766 to 1773, he was a member of the colony&#x27;s general assembly from 1766 to 1773 and served as speaker in 1771. He was also mayor of Elizabethtown before he became a member of the Continental Congress. Until his death in 1780, Crane held several public offices in New Jersey.

Crane was bayoneted by Hessian soldiers passing through Elizabethtown on their way to Battle of Springfield on June 23, 1780, and he died of his wounds on July 1, 1780. He was buried at the First Presbyterian Church of Elizabeth with his wife and father, Daniel Crane.

<doc id="992965" wikidata="Q232135" url="?curid=992965" title="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">
<text>Saint-Jean-de-Luz (; , locally ) is a commune in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department, southwestern France.
Saint-Jean-de-Luz is part of the Basque province of Labourd (Lapurdi).

==Geography==

Saint-Jean-de-Luz is a fishing port on the Basque coast and now a famous resort, known for its architecture, sandy bay, the quality of the light and the cuisine. The town is located south of Biarritz, on the right bank of the river Nivelle (French for Urdazuri) opposite to Ciboure. The port lies on the estuary just before the river joins the ocean. The summit of Larrun is about south-east of the town. The summit can be reached by the Petit train de la Rhune, which starts from the Col de Saint-Ignace, east of the town on the D4 road to Sare. It is in the traditional province of Lapurdi of the Basque Country.

Saint-Jean-de-Luz bay is a natural harbour in the south-east of the Bay of Biscay. It is the only sheltered bay between Arcachon and Spain. Thanks to its strong sea walls or dykes that protect the town from the full savagery of the Atlantic Ocean, it has become a favorite for bathers across the Basque Coast. Although the seaside resort is relatively recent, the port itself is centuries old, with the most prominent point in its history being the marriage in 1660 of Louis XIV and the Spanish princess Maria Teresa.

Water from the area flows into the town from the Nivelle and its smaller tributaries, the &quot;Etxeberri&quot;, &quot;Isaka&quot; and &quot;Xantako&quot; streams. There is also the &quot;Basarun&quot;, and its smaller tributary the &quot;Mendi&quot;, which passes directly through Saint-Jean-de-Luz. The river has been made accessible to boats and it joins the sea by the &quot;Erromardia&quot; beach. A branch of the Uhabia, an emblematic river in the neighbouring Bidart district, and its smaller &quot;Amisola&quot; tributary, also pass to the sea through St Jean de Luz.

===Transportation===

Saint-Jean-de-Luz straddles Route départementale D810, the old Route nationale 10. The town can be reached from the A63 motorway, Exit 3 (Saint-Jean-de-Luz Nord) and Exit 2 (Saint-Jean-de-Luz Sud). The Saint-Jean-de-Luz-Ciboure station is served by the SNCF Bordeaux–Irun railway.
Biarritz Airport is the closest airport to Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

==Etymology==
Saint-Jean-de-Luz is the French adaptation of the Labourdine Basque – from &#x27;saint&#x27;, &#x27;John&#x27; and &#x27;mud&#x27; + &#x27;made of&#x27; + &#x27;place of&#x27;; thus meaning &#x27;Saint John&#x27;s swamp&#x27;. It is a common misconception that &quot;Luz&quot; would be .

The town is named after the frequent floodings which occurred in the area over the centuries.

==History==

Saint-Jean-de-Luz is located on the Atlantic coast of France, just a few kilometres from the border with Spain. Its wealth stems from its port and its past, with the town being associated with both fishing, and with the capture of vessels by its own Basque corsaires, or pirates (English sailors used to call Saint-Jean-de-Luz the &quot;Viper&#x27;s Nest&quot;). This prosperity reached its height during the 17th Century, which is still considered as the town&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age.&quot; During this period, Saint-Jean-De-Luz became the second largest town in the Labourd region with a population or around 12,000, just behind Bayonne.

===Marriage of Louis XIV===
Saint-Jean-de-Luz is known for its royal wedding connection. In 1659, Cardinal Mazarin spent several months in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, from where he would embark on almost daily trips to Pheasant Island in the river Bidassoa (near modern-day Hendaye) for Franco-Spanish meetings that resulted in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, one clause of which was the marriage of Louis XIV to Maria Theresa, the Infanta of Spain. Saint-Jean-de-Luz and its church were chosen to host the royal wedding on 9 June 1660. The marriage is one of the most important political marriages in history that brought an end to a bitter war. Today, visitors of the cathedral can see that the main door is bricked off. Two legends circulate this oddity: First, it has been said that the door the couple passed through was later closed to represent the closing of the troubles between France and Spain. A more popular theory among the locals is that the king, Louis XIV, ordered the door to be closed off, so no other couple could walk into the church to be married in his footsteps.

===Peninsular War===
The Duke of Wellington set up his winter headquarters in the town during the Peninsular War, 1813–14.

===End of the nineteenth century===

At the end of the nineteenth century, Saint-Jean-de-Luz became a popular beachside resort town for the surrounding high-society. Like Biarritz (called &quot;The queen of the beaches, the beach of kings&quot;), Saint-Jean-de-Luz was particularly appreciated by the French and Spanish aristocracy. By the early 1900s, it turned into the scene of Carlist conspiratorial activities. The composer Maurice Ravel, a native of the nearby town of Ciboure, frequently vacationed at Saint-Jean-de-Luz from Paris, where he was centered for almost his entire life.

Following Marshal Pétain&#x27;s call for an armistice on the outset of World War II, a coastal fringe of the Basque Country fell in the German occupation area. Before the agreement was enforced, a retreating Polish Army was evacuated from the town in mid June 1940.

===Postwar===

After 1945, some of the traditional fishing-based industries of the Fargeot district gradually disappeared, mainly by overfishing and competition from elsewhere. The change strengthened the transformation of the town towards more luxury and tourism industries. In Saint-Jean-de-Luz over 40% of dwellings of the town are second homes. 

In the 1960s, the town expanded northwards (Avenue de l&#x27;Ocean) and also southwards in the direction of (the Urdazuri district). Since the 1970s, St Jean de Luz has been connected to Bordeaux to the north and Spain to the south by the motorway, and more recently by the TGV railway. St-Jean-de-Luz boasts extensive and attractive land and scenery, as well as a well-preserved coastline which has so far escaped urbanization . Although some of the Basque coast has seen a degree of development, the area between Fort Socoa and the Abbadia nature reserve and castle remains in its natural state.
==Population==
==Cultural heritage==
The town features a large number of residences built in the 17th and 18th centuries along the Quai de L&#x27;Infante, Rue Mazarin, Rue Gambetta and at the Place Louis XIV. In some respects this is testament to the families, shipowners and Basque merchants from this period. One of these, built alongside the Quai de L&#x27;Infante around 1640, is called the &quot;Maison Joanoenea&quot;, and it is here that the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria, stayed before the marriage of Louis XIV to Maria Theresa, the Infanta of Spain on 8 May 1660. The Infanta stayed there on 7 June. Locally this house is referred to as the &quot;Maison de l&#x27;Infante&quot;, and it has become a popular tourist attraction and museum.
A monument in the Verdun Square honours the memory of the fallen soldiers from World War I and World War II, and another monument on the Quai L&#x27;Infante is dedicated to the resistance movement Orion. This second plaque commemorates the importance of the work of French escape networks which helped people evade capture in Occupied France during World War II. Finally, there are some bunkers still visible along the coast. These formed part of the infamous Atlantic Wall, German defences against the anticipated Allied invasion of Westen France. Some remains are still visible on the Santa-Barbe promenade.

==Tourism==
Nowadays, St-Jean-de-Luz depends strongly on tourism with safe clean beaches, notable high quality hotels and a seawater spa, swimming pools, a casino, golf courses and a conference centre that is under construction. The town also benefits from regional tourism, with many attracted by the pedestrian area full of shops open all year round. It also attracts a large number of visitors from Basque Country, Spain, or Gipuzkoa along with many from nearby Bayonne and the rest of southwestern France. The city is particularly attractive to retired people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas across France. 

Many cultural and sporting events are held throughout the year. There are internships and public concerts of classical music organized by the Académie Ravel, usually in the auditorium of the same name. There is a film festival dedicated to young filmmakers, a surfing film festival and Basque Pelota championships.

==The tradition of the Basque ‘Trials of Strength&#x27;==

The origin of Basque Trials of Strength is found in the daily tasks carried out across the region. For centuries, young Basque farmers pitted themselves against each other in physical challenges. Labouring in the forests of the Basque country gave rise to the challenge known as &quot;aizkolariak&quot; (based on lumberjacks working with an ax or &quot;arpanariak&quot;), as well as athletic sawing of tree stumps and wood. The construction of buildings, often based on large stones for the cathedrals and monasteries led to the development of the challenge known as &quot;arrijasotzaileak&quot; – literally those who lift stones.

Several events originate from working in the fields, the best known of which is &quot;lastoaltxatzea&quot;, the lifting of straw bales. This is done either using a pitchfork or a pulley, and is often organized in tandem with &quot;joko&quot; (cart-lifting), &quot;zakulasterka&quot; (individual relay or sack races), and &quot;untziketariak&quot;, a race involving pitchers of milk. Also well-known is &quot;soka-shot&quot;, or tug-of-war, which is an internationally recognised discipline celebrated in fourteen countries. During the summer, demonstrations of &quot;Force Basque&quot; are organised by the local Xiste organization, often at the main municipal arena in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

<text>The York Wasps (known simply as York from 1868 to 1989, Ryedale-York from 1989 to 1996 and York Wasps from 1996 to 2002) was an English professional rugby league club based in York. At the start of the 2002 season, the club was dissolved. A new club, York City Knights was established to take the Wasps&#x27; place for the 2003 season.

==History==
===Early years===
The club was first formed as &quot;York Football Club&quot; in 1868 and played both association and rugby football, for the first few seasons they had portable goal posts as they did not have their own ground and would play wherever they could find a pitch. Eventually a permanent pitch was secured on Knavesmire. Other early grounds included Clifton Ings and Poad&#x27;s Field.

It took three years for the club to record their first victory, and that was in an association football match against York Training College. Results picked up in the mid-1870s as the club attracted a higher standard of player. In 1877, York were among several leading Yorkshire clubs who inaugurated the Yorkshire Challenge Cup. In the first season 16 teams battled it out for the T&#x27;owd Tin Pot, with York eventually losing out to Halifax in the final.

In 1883 the club moved to the Wigginton Road Cricket Ground of the Yorkshire Gentlemen and also amalgamated with York Melbourne Club. In 1884, they were asked to leave the ground due to financial problems and spoiling the playing surface. The club moved to Grange St (Fishergate).

In 1885, the club leased a plot of land from the York Lunatic (Bootham) Asylum at the end of the Clarence Street in 1885. The first game at the new site was between a York XV and 20 players from the city on 19 September 1885.

The club made great strides with the team of 1895, which won virtually all their home matches. Off the field the club paid £85 for the Waterman&#x27;s Mission Hut in Fishergate and converted it into their first grandstand, incorporating dressing rooms. Previously players had changed, first at the Adelphi Hotel (later The Railway King) on George Hudson St and later at Shorts Baths (Clarence St).

===Northern Union===
Northern rugby teams broke away from the Rugby Football Union to form their own Northern Union in 1895. York initially stayed with the Rugby Football Union but as more and more clubs began to join the new order, it became a financial necessity to follow suit. The decision to join the Northern Union was taken at a meeting at the Bar Hotel, Micklegate, on Monday, 25 April 1898 and five days later they played their first Northern Union match against Hull Kingston Rovers losing 29–2.
The York club was first admitted to the Rugby Football League in 1901. In 1902/03 the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues were combined to form a second division. They defeated the touring All Golds team in 1908. York was one of the new teams to join the second division. After the First World War, they became known as &quot;the Dreadnoughts&quot;. They beat the visiting Australasian team of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain 9–3. York played touring teams on a number of occasions between 1908 and 1978. There were 8 games against Australia (one win and one draw) and 6 games against New Zealand (3 wins).

Arguably York&#x27;s best moment came in 1931 when they reached the Challenge Cup Final for the first time, only to be beaten 22–8 by Halifax. York had finished as the top Yorkshire club in 1932–33 for the first time and fourth in the league to qualify for the Championship play-offs but were beaten by Swinton. In the 1922/3 season, York beat Batley 5–0 in the Yorkshire Cup final held at Headingley before a giant crowd of 33,719. In 1933, York beat Hull Kingston Rovers 10–4 in the Yorkshire Cup final held at Headingley. 10 February 1934, York&#x27;s record attendance was set when 14,689 turned up to watch a Challenge Cup match against Swinton, which ended in a 0–0 draw.

York again made the final of the Yorkshire Cup in 1935 but were beaten by Leeds 3–0 at Thrum Hall, Halifax but were back the next year this time beating Wakefield Trinity 9–2 in a final held at Headingley. They also lost the 1978 final to Bradford Northern by 18–8.

Bill Kirkbride became coach in 1980. York team lifted the Division Two title in 1980–81, beating Hunslet 53–7 to guarantee themselves the title with two games to spare, finishing above big-guns Wigan and newly formed Fulham. Kirkbride left in 1982. Immediate relegation was followed by promotion in 1985.

Financial problems forced the club to sell their training pitch (behind The Popular Stand) for £200,000 in 1986. Three years later faced with a large bill for safety work, the rest of the stadium was sold to a housing developer for £705,000, less than half what the ground was worth. On 26 March 1989 York&#x27;s last match at Clarence Street produced a 26–17 victory over Hunslet in front of a crowd of 2,904 spectators.

===Ryedale-York===

Gary Stephens became coach in 1988. When plans to ground share with York City F.C. broke down, York moved to the newly constructed Ryedale Stadium two miles to the north of the city at Huntington in Ryedale district. As the stadium was financed by Ryedale District Council the club became known as &quot;Ryedale-York&quot;. The first league game at the new stadium was on 8 October 1989 against Keighley. Ryedale Stadium&#x27;s record attendance for a rugby league match was set on 5 January 1990 when 4,977 turned up to watch a division two match against Halifax.

In 1991, Ryedale-York and Fulham toured Russia, an act that caused many Russian rugby union clubs to switch to rugby league. 
Stephens left as coach.

Ryedale-York were demoted to the Third Division in 1992 having finished seventh in the Second Division. The next year, they were back in the Second Division as the league returned to a two division structure with the bulk of Third Division sides joining the new Second Division.

Stuart Horton took over the coaching reins from Roger Millward in January 1995. Ryedale-York conceived a &#x27;Super League plan&#x27; with Gateshead Council in 1995 with the intention of moving to Gateshead. The club&#x27;s last game as Ryedale-York took place in April, an away game against Carlisle that was played in Gateshead. The relocation never came to pass and owing to a change in local council boundaries, Huntington, was now a civil parish in the newly formed unitary authority of the City of York. The newly renamed &quot;York Wasps&quot; playing at the &quot;Huntington stadium&quot; were confirmed as being in the Second Division which was now the third tier of rugby league, on 30 April.

===York Wasps===
York were beaten by amateur side West Hull 10–6 in the Challenge Cup on Humberside on a frozen pitch, in the 1996 Challenge Cup. They became the first professional side to lose to an amateur club in the fourth round, and it was only the third time a minnow had triumphed against a giant in the event since the Second World War. Horton was sacked at the end of 1996 for alleged gross misconduct after the postponement of a friendly fixture at Hull. 

Dean Robinson was appointed Coach for the 1997 Season with York Wasps in Division 2. In Season 1998 York won promotion under Robinson into Division 1. However in 1999 both divisions were brought together as the Northern Ford Premiership, with York finishing 7th in the newly formatted division.

York won one game in the Northern Ford Premiership in 2000 and finished the campaign with a team of amateurs after almost folding. Due to financial difficulties and problems with training facilities coach Dean Robinson resigned in the early part of the season in March 2000. Caretaker coach Garry Atkins took over for three months and tried to manage the team with the club in grave difficulties.

Lee Crooks took over as coach in August 2000. They attracted sponsorship from the New York Economic Development Council for the 2001 season. This promised, but did not deliver, a bright future. Lee Crooks resigned and academy coach Martin Flynn took charge for the final Northern Ford Premiership home game.

York made an unsuccessful approach to buy the London Broncos in August 2001 and form a merged club under a new name, York Wasps Ltd, to play in Super League. Australian Leo Epifania came over to England to be head coach of York Wasps in September.

On 19 March 2002, after completing 11 games, York Wasps announced that they had folded. After a last-ditch take-over deal to save the Wasps collapses, the RFL accept the club&#x27;s resignation on 26 March 2002. Ironically the plug was pulled less than a fortnight after the club&#x27;s first win in 13 months.

Head coach, Leo Epifania quit England but York players continued to train with the idea of playing later in the season under unpaid caretaker-boss Stuart Horton. A supporters&#x27; trust working party was formed on 27 March 2002 and applied to the RFL to continue the 2002 Northern Ford Premiership fixtures. After hearing it would be impossible to meet requirements to return that season, on 5 May 2002 fans backed new proposals for a new club to apply for admittance to the league for 2003, and a new club, York City Knights, was subsequently established.

<doc id="992975" wikidata="Q2912707" url="?curid=992975" title="Military colours, standards and guidons">
<text>In military organizations, the practice of carrying colours, standards, flags, or guidons, both to act as a rallying point for troops and to mark the location of the commander, is thought to have originated in Ancient Egypt some 5,000 years ago. The Roman Empire also made battle standards reading SPQR a part of their vast armies. It was formalized in the armies of Europe in the High Middle Ages, with standards being emblazoned with the commander&#x27;s coat of arms.

==General use==

Military colours originally had a practical use in battle. As armies became trained and adopted set formations, each regiment&#x27;s ability to keep its formation was potentially critical to its success, and therefore its entire army&#x27;s success. In the chaos of battle, due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was.

Regimental flags are generally awarded to a regiment by a head of state during a ceremony. They were therefore treated with respect as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. Colours may be inscribed with the names of battles or other symbols representing former achievements (see battle honours).

Regiments tended to adopt &quot;colour guards&quot;, composed of experienced or élite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy&#x27;s standard was considered as a great feat of arms.

Standards and colours are never capriciously destroyed – when too old to use they are replaced and then laid up in museums, religious buildings and other places of significance to their regiment. However, in most modern armies, standing orders now call for the colours to be intentionally destroyed if they are ever in jeopardy of being captured by the enemy.

Due to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, colours are no longer carried into battle, but continue to be used at events of formal character.

==Colours==
===Asia===
====Cambodia====
In Cambodia, the Colours of the Military and other uniformed institutions follow British, US, and French practice. 

Until 2022, what was essentially a large version of the Flag of Cambodia with the unit name below in white in the bottom blue stripe was used as the King&#x27;s Colour of RCAF formations before being reassigned as the National Colour for parades and ceremonies. In 2023, a new Chinese-derived design but also harking to the days of the old kingdoms on Cambodian territories, debuted - it&#x27;s a unified design with the insignia of the unit or formation at the center and the unit name in Khmer below but with the colors differing per service:

* Army and Gendarmerie - Red
* Navy - Navy Blue
* Air Force - Sky Blue

==== China, People&#x27;s Republic of (Mainland China) ====
The People&#x27;s Liberation Army is the overall body for the entire armed forces of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and is represented by a single flag, which serves as a ceremonial colour for all regiments and larger formations. This is based on the national flag, but has instead of the four smaller gold stars the Chinese characters for the numerals &#x27;8&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27;, which stand for 1 August, the day in 1927 that the PLA was founded. When paraded, the flag is fringed in gold and mounted on a red-and-gold pole.

Each branch of the PLA has its own flag, based on the Army Flag (Banners of the PLA):
*Ground Forces: identical to the Army flag, but with the lower 40% coloured green.
*Navy: identical to the Army flag, but with the lower 40% has three blue and two white horizontal stripes of equal width.
*Air Force: identical to the Army flag, but with the lower 40% coloured air force blue.
*Rocket Forces: identical to the Army flag, but with the lower 40% being a gold stripe.
These, too, are not paraded publicly except with the same gold fringe as the Army flag.

Individual unit colours based on the PLA service colour would be introduced only from 2018 (and that, only on a test basis), when mobile contingents of units of the Northern Theater Command which took part in the joint military exercise &quot;Vostok 2018&quot; with the Russian Armed Forces carried red colours with the unit name on the white fringe nearest the flagpole. Test battle colours had been given to the People&#x27;s Armed Police some years before the practice was adopted by the PLA Ground Forces on an experimental period. During the 1 October 2019 civil military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a mobile colour guard unit debuted after many years the garrison colours awarded to every PLA formation and agency, which are red with the formation or agency name in Mandarin Chinese in white or gold lettering (but without the white fringe), with some colours bearing additional inscriptions bearing either battle honours or decorations awarded to the formation or agency concerned.

==== China, Republic of (Taiwan) ====
The army of the Republic of China (Taiwan) also has a single flag that it uses, which is red, with a banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun in the centre. It has a red flagpole with silver spearhead finial and red tassels immediately underneath. Individual units use a variation of the Army Flag as their own identifying Colour; this features a white strip next to the hoist, which has the unit&#x27;s name in black characters, as well as a golden fringe (as is the case since 1961 for all units of the Republic of China Armed Forces, but since 1947 were limited only to Army units above the regimental level). The army honour guard colour is in gold with the unit coat of arms in the centre.

The Republic of China Navy&#x27;s colours were red but with the seal of the Navy in a dark blue canton in the centre until the 1980s, the honour guard company&#x27;s colours only use both dark blue and the Navy seal, which are the same colours used today in other ROCN units.

For the Republic of China Marine Corps, its unit battle colours, since 1960, mirrors that of the USMC but since the 1980s the unit name is on the white stripe near the hoist (just as the rest of the armed forces, formerly it was on a scroll similar to the USMC&#x27;s).

The colours used by the Republic of China Air Force are in sky blue with the air force seal in the centre (formerly it was red with the sky blue canton featuring the coat of arms, the old design only used today by the honour guard).

Units of the Republic of China Military Police, formerly using a blue colour, now use a brown colour with the ROCMP arms.

Units reporting to the Ministry of National Defence sport an orange colour with the coast arms of the Ministry in the centre. Garrison colours are in blue with the Kuomintang emblem, a wheat wreath and 3 interlocked circles in yellow, red and blue respectively. Reserve units carry a red colour while the Taiwan Reserve uses a green one.

Only the following military academies sport their colours as the ROCAF colour is used by the Republic of China Air Force Academy:

* Republic of China Military Academy
* Republic of China Naval Academy

In all events whenever the ROCAF is involved, the ROC flag is used as the National colour.

==== Korea, Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of (North Korea) ====

The Korean People&#x27;s Army is the overall body for the entire armed forces of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. Until 1993 the KPA was represented by a single flag, which served as a ceremonial colour for all regiments, educational institutions and larger formations. The colour is on the basis of the national flag but with the national emblem replacing the star and on parades the colours were surrounded by gold fringe. The gold lettering in Hangul until 1961 was &quot;For the unification and independence of the motherland and the people&quot; (), then replaced by &quot;For the unification and independence of the motherland, and the freedom and happiness of the people&quot; ().

In 1993, as part of the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean War and the 45th since the founding of the DPRK, the old colour was replaced by the designs seen for over three decades in major holiday parades. All the colours shared the same reverse with the emblem of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea in gold and, save for the Worker-Peasant Red Guards, have identical gold letting in Hangul which states &quot;Revolutionary armed forces of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, Korean People&#x27;s Army [unit name] / No.425 unit (in ceremonies)&quot; (), the 425 number honouring the date (25 April) of the 1932 foundation of the People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Army, whose lineage is continued by the current service, but with the same colours as in the obverse, which also shows the 4.25 mark in gold numbering. The Guards units also had its badge beneath the 4.25 mark. In 2023, as part of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People&#x27;s Army, a new amended design based on the 1992–93 templates was adopted for the KPA with the new motto &quot;For the endless prosperity of the fatherland and the security of the people!&quot; (), and the 4.25 mark was finally removed, with the date of the service branch or unit raising now replacing it. Guards formations retained their official emblem below the foundation date. The reverse of these colours was updated with the graphic pattern consist of a silhouette of the KWP headquarter and a red shield bearing the emblem of KWP in the middle, and additional motto &quot;Let us defend the Party&#x27;s Central Committee headed by Dear Comrade Kim Jong Un with our lives!&quot; () at the top. These colours are in gold fringe when brought out in public parades in Pyongyang, the national capital, and during state visits by the honour guards of the Supreme Guard Command, which is an inter-service formation unlike the rest of the command whose personnel are drawn from the Ground Forces. The 1948–1961 design colours, since the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the conclusion of the Korean War in 2013, have been brought out only by guards units and KPA battalions sporting historical dress uniforms of the 1940s and early 1950s, the 1948 colours have a gold Guards Badge outline in the reverse to denote Guards status of the unit&#x27;s colour while the colours only use the 1948 arms and motto instead of the current one.

==== Korea, Republic of (South Korea) ====

The traditions of military unit and branch colours of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces are mostly derived from the Western practice with the Flag of South Korea treated as a National Colour.

Today each of the ROKAF&#x27;s service branches have branch regimental colours, all gold fringed, which are carried by colour guards following a mix of Western traditions. The colours are as follows:

* Army: Blue and white with service emblem
* Navy: Blue with white canton (taegeuk with crossed anchors)
** Marine Corps: Scarlet with service emblem
* Air Force: Air force/sky blue with gold service emblem

In major holiday parades two additional colours are paraded as part of the national colour guard.

* Honorary Colour of the Armed Forces and Ministry of National Defence: Red with armed forces emblem
* Colour of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the MND and ROKAF: Crimson

Unit and specialty colours follow a mix of the Western models with influences from the Western model, sharing since the 1990s a common design with the unit name in Hangul below the emblem (in the Navy, the unit/command name is on a white scroll below following US precedence).

* Colours of units under the ROK Army
** Regimental, brigade, division and corps colours: Army Colour with unit DUI/emblem replacing the service arms
** Infantry: Blue
** Armour: Yellow
** Artillery and Missile Command: Burgundy red
** Air defence artillery: Green
** Engineers: Light blue
** Special operations: Black 
** Logistics and service support: White/Orange
** Reserve units: Dark blue
** Army aviation: Blue
* Colours of units under the ROK Navy
** Fleet forces and other commands: Navy blue
** Marine Corps: Scarlet
** Service support: White
** Educational and training institutions: White/Navy blue
* All ROK Air Force formations: Sky blue

In addition, the traditional guard unit under the 3rd Infantry Division of the ROKA carries replica colours similar to those used during the Imperial era, that was used by Sumunjang or royal palace guards with its traditional military band, Daechwita. They are only brought out during state visits to the republic and on major holidays.

====Laos====
In Laos, the Colours of the Military and other uniformed institutions follow North Korean practice. It is basically a large version of the Laotian flag with the unit name below in white in the top and bottom red stripe.

====Philippines====
Philippine military colours are the Flag of the Philippines as the National Colour, the Organizational Colours, and the Unit Battle Colour. The Flag of the Philippines is the National Colour of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, but unlike the US colour has no markings on the flag. The Organizational Colours are the flags of the AFP&#x27;s four Major Service Commands while the Unit Battle Colour differs per service arm and unit. Like the US, it also has 2nd order guidons for companies and troops, but these are also based on the Spanish military guidons and banners, not on the American ones, reflecting the long history of the military establishment here. These guidons are therefore not swallow tailed save for the PMA, the Philippine Army&#x27;s Escort and Security Btn and some other units under the Philippine Army.

The color facings of the Organizational Colours are:

* Army: Green
* Navy: Ultramarine blue
* Air Force: Air Force Blue
* AFP GHQ: Air force blue, dark blue and green

====Thailand====
Each unit of the Royal Thai Armed Forces is given a colour called the &quot;&quot; () or Victory Colours. These are presented to each unit personally by the King of Thailand. The colours are divided into four different designs, for: Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, Royal Thai Air Force and King&#x27;s Guard units. Colours of the Navy carry no fringe, the rest have gold fringe. All carry the reigning monarch&#x27;s cypher on the top right corner near the hoist.

Before their presentation, the colours are ceremonially blessed in a religious ceremony attended by Buddhist monks and other high ranking dignitaries inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok. During the ceremony amidst the chanting of the monks, the King will personally hammer the brass nails into the staff of each colour using a silver hammer. Each colour contains about 32–35 nails, in which the cloth is attached to the wooden staff. Within the same ceremony, the King will also take a strand of his own hair and conceal it within a compartment at the top of the staff, which is closed by a round silver screw top. The King will also attach each colour with its own ceremonial Buddha image, and bless each colour with holy water. The ceremony is steeped in Buddhist and Brahmic heritage; it symbolizes and cements the King&#x27;s role as Chief Kshatriya (กษัตริย์) or Warrior ruler of his realm. It also emphasizes his constitutional role as Head and Chief of the Thai Armed Forces (จอมทัพไทย: Chomthap Thai).

These colours are similar to the Flag of Thailand and therefore are treated like the State Colours of the Commonwealth, but are not lowered to the ground but kept above it to the tune of Sansoen Phra Barami (the Royal Anthem) when salutes are rendered by these Colours to the Thai Royal Family (most especially the King and Queen) in all military events that they attend.


==== Vietnam ====
Similar to Chinese practice, the Flag of Vietnam is used as a National Colour by all formations of battalion level above within the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. It is fringed in gold, and when used in ceremonies, often has the gold motto (&quot;determination to win&quot;) at the top right corner of the colour near the hoist, with any decorations and/or medals attached to it.

=== Commonwealth of Nations ===


The colours of the infantry and standards of the cavalry are a set of large flags, unique to each regiment, that the ordinary soldier would be able to identify straight away.

====Australia, Canada, and New Zealand====

The naval and air forces of all three of these countries also have similar colours based on their own ensigns. Rules stipulated by the Canadian Department of Defence state that the First, or Senior Colours symbolizes the unit&#x27;s loyalty to the Crown; authorization to possess a king&#x27;s colour may only be granted, and the colour presented, by the monarch or his vice-regal representative. The design based on the flag of Canada reflects the custom established for infantry line regiments in the mid-18th century, when the sovereign&#x27;s colour was based on the national flag, as was the practice in British and French units in Canada.

=====Air Force=====
*Royal Australian Air Force: The king&#x27;s colour of the RAAF is the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign. It is similar to that of the RAF – however, in addition to the RAAF roundel, which is in the lower fly, it has the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist and the stars of the Southern Cross in the upper fly, with the royal cypher in the centre. The flag has a border of golden wattle as well as golden fringe. Squadron and command colours are in air force blue with the honours and the heraldic emblem of the formation.
*Royal Canadian Air Force: The king&#x27;s colour of the RCAF is different from that of other Commonwealth air forces in that it is not based on the ensign but instead is similar to the King&#x27;s colours of infantry regiments: it is a silk national flag of Canada with a red circlet on the maple leaf inscribed with the name of the command, surrounding the royal cypher, and ensigned with the royal crown. Uniquely among Commonwealth air forces, the RCAF also has a command colour, analogous to an infantry regimental colour. This is light blue with the RCAF badge in the centre and a maple leaf in each corner, stems inward. Squadrons with 25 years or more of active service receive squadron standards with battle honours surrounding the unit badge on the same light blue background edged with flowers (the ten provincial floral emblems).

=====Army=====
* Australian infantry battalions formed just prior to or during World War I had a pair (a stand) of colours, being a King&#x27;s Colour based on the Union Flag and a separate Regimental Colour emblazoned with the battalion number and its colour patch (shoulder badge). Battle honours were also emblazoned on the Regimental Colour. These customs followed the British tradition. Some of those World War I battalions were amalgamated prior to or during World War II. For example, the 57th Battalion amalgamated with the 60th Battalion in 1930, forming the 57th/60th Battalion which saw action in the South West Pacific campaigns during World War II. The 57th/60th Battalion did not have its own colours, but by dint of history inherited both stands of colours from the 57th and the 60th. In accordance with the order of battle the 57th/60th wore the colour patch of the 57th on its uniforms, but they still paraded and presented the colours of both the 57th and the 60th. Queen Elizabeth II gave permission in 1960 for the battle honours from World War II (South-West Pacific 1943–45, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Commando Road, etc.) to be emblazoned on the Queen&#x27;s colours, rather than on the Regimental Colours, which were already emblazoned with honours from World War I (The Somme, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens, etc.). A similar situation occurred with the amalgamation in 1942 of the 58th Battalion and the 59th Battalion to form the 58th/59th Battalion, which wore the colour patch of the 58th Battalion on its uniforms but inherited and paraded both stands of colours from the 58th Battalion and 59th Battalion. The 57th/60th Battalion and the 58th/59th Battalion were disbanded soon after World War II and the colours were laid up in the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne where they are on display in the Crypt. The Shrine and other war memorials and churches around Australia display many other stands of battalion colours that have been laid up in their care, such as St Stephens Church, Sydney.
* While the colours of the Australian Army infantry regiments follow the British tradition, starting in the 1960s colours based on the Australian national flag are now used as the king&#x27;s colour. Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by cavalry, lancer, light horse and mounted infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Guidons are also carried by aviation units. Only the Royal Australian Artillery&#x27;s regiments uses guns rather than flags as the colours, sans A Field Battery, which carries the King&#x27;s Banner in recognition of service as the first all-Australian artillery battery. The regiment as a whole carries its own King&#x27;s Banner. Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, but have Standards or Banners instead. The Royal Military College, Duntroon also has an additional colour, the Sovereign&#x27;s Banner, carried yearly by the RMC&#x27;s Champion Company from the Corps of Staff Cadets formed from the best cadet company for the year, which on parades takes precedence over the other companies as the Sovereign&#x27;s Company. The Army itself since 2001 has a banner known as the Army Banner, carried on all events of the service (as the Army is the protector of the traditions of the Flag of Australia, and thus does not have its own service colour). It is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial. The Army Banner bears the Australian Coat of Arms on the obverse, with the dates &quot;1901–2001&quot; in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the &quot;rising sun&quot; badge of the Australian Army, flanked by seven campaign honours on small gold-edged scrolls: South Africa, World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya-Borneo, South Vietnam, Peacekeeping and East Timor. It was presented to the Army in celebration of its 2001 centennial year.
* In the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Armoured Corps (RCAC) regiments designated horse guards and dragoon guards, along with the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, have regimental standards. RCAC standards have a crimson field and the CSOR standard has a tan field. RCAC regiments other than horse guards and dragoon guards have crimson regimental guidons. Each battalion of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, except those of rifle regiments, has a stand of two colours: a king&#x27;s colour and a regimental colour. For foot guards, the King&#x27;s colours have a crimson field, and the regimental colours are based on the Canadian national flag. For other infantry regiments, the king&#x27;s colours are based on the national flag, and the regimental colours are of the regimental facing colour. Only the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery uses guns for its colours. The rifle regiments share the traditions of the former British rifle regiments of having their battle honours carried on their drums. The Royal Canadian Engineers do not have colours but have the motto , Latin for &#x27;everywhere&#x27;, on their cap badges and other insignia to represent their service everywhere.
*Only the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, the sole infantry regiment of the New Zealand Army, has a stand of colours, with the king&#x27;s colour now based on the Flag of New Zealand, with the Union Flag canton carrying the regimental insignia, and the regimental colour being royal blue due to its status as a royal regiment. Stands of Colours are present in the regiment&#x27;s two regular and three reserve battalions. Until 1964, when the New Zealand infantry was reorganized into a single regiment, all the reserve infantry regiments also carried their own colours. The sole armoured regiment, Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Mounted Rifles, carries a guidon in the traditions of cavalry units raised in New Zealand since the 19th century.

=====Navy=====
*Royal Australian Navy: The King&#x27;s Colour of the RAN is the Australian White Ensign it is a reverse of the Australian national flag (white with blue stars), with Elizabeth II&#x27;s royal cypher and Garter band positioned between the Commonwealth Star and the stars representing the Southern Cross. (See former colours at Naval Chapel, Garden Island NSW.) The RAN possesses two colours, the first is the Fleet Colour held on behalf of the fleet units by Fleet Headquarters, . The second, known as the Establishment Colour, is held by on behalf of the shore establishments.
*Royal Canadian Navy: The King&#x27;s Naval Colour is a variation of the Canadian Naval Ensign it is white, with the Canadian flag in the canton, the cypher from Elizabeth II&#x27;s personal flag for the Commonwealth (a crowned &quot;E&quot; surrounded by a wreath of roses) in the centre, and the symbol of the navy in the lower fly. The edge of the colour is trimmed in gold. Until 1979 the RCN possessed two identical colours: one for the Atlantic fleet and one for the Pacific fleet. Since then, a single colour has been held at Naval Service Headquarters.
*Royal New Zealand Navy: Since 1968 the RNZN King&#x27;s Colour is a variant of the Naval Ensign of New Zealand itself the Flag of New Zealand but in white, with Elizabeth II&#x27;s royal cypher and Garter band situated near the Southern Cross.
==== India ====
Given its Commonwealth heritage as a former British colony, the Indian Armed Forces sports colours which are equivalent to those used in the British military.

===== Presidential Colours to service branches of the armed forces =====
Only the Navy and Air Force sport President&#x27;s Service Colours which are their respective naval ensign and air force flag which are gold fringed with modifications:

* The Navy&#x27;s PSC, used since 2022, carries the Lion Capital of Ashoka, the basis of the state emblem, atop the naval heraldric arms, with the National Motto (&quot;Truth Alone Triumphs&quot;) below
* The Air Force PSC has an elephant above the Air Force Roundel

===== President&#x27;s Colours/Standards/Guidons/Banners of military units =====
President&#x27;s Colours (Standard and Guidon for mounted units of the Army and Air Force flying units and Banners for service arms and the light infantry) are awarded to distinguished units of the Armed Forces by the President of India, who is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, these are the equivalents to British regimental colours. In the Army, these colours carry the regimental/battalion insignia and any recognized battle honours won by the unit.

* Army 
** Cavalry Standards – per colour facing
** Cavalry Guidons – same as standards
** Artillery and Air Defence Artillery Banners - burgundy red and blue
** Infantry Colours – per respective colour facing
** Light Infantry and Rifle Colours – same as regular infantry
** Service Corps Banners/Colours – per respective colours
* Air Force – sky blue

Only the President&#x27;s Bodyguard has had in times a full strand following British practice, consisting of the President&#x27;s Standard and a Regimental Standard.

====Malaysia====
The same format of Sovereign&#x27;s and Regimental Colours also apply in Malaysia. The King&#x27;s Colours and Regimental Colours of the Malaysian Armed Forces are the flags given by the King of Malaysia in his responsibilities as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and by the 8 other state monarchs. The colours are given to units recognized as Royal units and to flags of large formations (the King&#x27;s Colour) and to units receiving their new regimental colours (the Unit Regimental Colour).

The King&#x27;s Colour is yellow with the national arms surrounded by paddy on the centre. Thus Malaysia is one of only two Commonwealth countries, the other being Brunei, that does not use its national flag as a senior Colour (the flag is the senior colour of the entire Armed Forces establishment). The sides are emblazoned with the battle honours of the unit. On the canton the service emblem of either service of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) can be seen. The Regimental Colour, however, differs by service arm or branch (the latter case being used in the Army) and unit. Both flags have gold fringes surrounding them. These colours are only present in formal parades.

During the Independence Day Parade and on Armed Forces Day on 21 September, as the armed services on parade do not wear their dress uniforms, only the 1st Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment, which wears dress uniforms, is present with its King&#x27;s and Regimental Colours. For the rest of the services on public parade, the following order then applies:

* Service Colour/Regimental Camp Flag
* Flag of Malaysia (National Colour)
* Colour of the Malaysian Armed Forces

In addition the Royal Johor Military Force was granted its privilege in the 1910s, as the sole state defense force in the country, to have its own Regimental Colour.

Victoria Institution is the only private educational institution granted Colours for its role in the Second World War.

====Singapore====
Singaporean military colours of the Singapore Armed Forces are divided today into Service State Colours and Unit Regimental Colours. Until 1997 there were also Service Regimental Colours and Unit State Colours. The Service State Colours are similar to the Flag of Singapore but differ per service, with the service emblem in the white field. But Regimental Colours are different, and they differ per unit or service arm (save for the flags of the Air Force and Navy that show their respective service colours instead and some SAF service-wide commands like the Military Police). Their common design is that of the regimental or command arms at the centre of the colour, which is in the colour of the unit uniform facings or service branch which it belongs. Both are gold fringed and are brought out on major occasions only. The former Unit State Colours carried the unit emblem or badge in the white field of the national flag.

====Sri Lanka====
When Sri Lanka declared itself a republic in 1972 the units that had a King&#x27;s colour, first using the Union Jack and then the current national flag, retired them. These were replaced by the new President&#x27;s Colour, which was first awarded in 1972.
The following colours have been awarded:

*Sri Lanka Army
**Regiments
***Sri Lanka Light Infantry – 1978
***Gemunu Watch – 1980
***Gajaba Regiment – 2007
***Sri Lanka Armoured Corps
***Sri Lanka Artillery
**Establishments
***Army Training Centre – 1972, laid up 20 August 1992
***Sri Lanka Military Academy – 1997
*Sri Lanka Air Force
**Sri Lanka Air Force – 1976
**SLAF Regiment – 2009
**Squadrons
***No. 1 Flying Training Wing – 2001
***No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron – 2009
***No. 4 (VIP) Helicopter Squadron – 2009
***No. 9 Attack Helicopter Squadron – 2009
***No. 10 Fighter Squadron – 2009
**Stations
***SLAF Katunayake – 2001
*Sri Lanka Navy
**Commanders
***Admiral of the fleet Wasantha Karannagoda
**Establishments
***Naval and Maritime Academy – 2000

Regimental colours follow the British model, and the two light infantry regiments (Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment and Sri Lanka Rifle Corps) do not carry colours at all. Unlike the British Royal Artillery, the Sri Lanka Artillery carries a set of President&#x27;s and Regimental Colours, the same case for the Sri Lanka Engineers.

Unlike the Air Force which uses a single colour design similar to the RAF, the Navy sports unit and command colours in the same fashion as the Army.

The design of the President&#x27;s Colours of Navy and Air Force units are the gold fringed versions of their service flags. The Army President&#x27;s Colour is a gold fringed national flag with the national arms in between the teal and orange stripes on the left.

====United Kingdom====
=====Line infantry and foot guards=====

In regiments of infantry of the British Army and the armies of other Commonwealth countries, each battalion carries two colours, which collectively are called a stand. These are large flags, usually , and mounted on a half pike which is long; the king&#x27;s or queen&#x27;s colour (state or president&#x27;s colour if the country is a republic) is usually a version of the country&#x27;s national flag, often trimmed with gold fabric, and with the regiment&#x27;s insignia placed in the centre. The regimental colour is a flag of a single colour, usually the colour of the uniform facings (collar/lapels and cuffs) of the regiment, again often trimmed and with the insignia in the centre. Most regiments that are designated as &#x27;royal&#x27; regiments (that is either have the word &#x27;Royal&#x27; or the sponsorship of a royal personage in their name) have a royal blue regimental colour, most royal regiments have a Union Flag canton in that background. Irish regiments, today the Royal Irish Regiment, have a dark green regimental colour.

The colours of the five regiments of Foot Guards have the pattern of the line infantry reversed, with the king&#x27;s colour of each of the 1st Battalions being crimson with the regimental insignia, a royal crown and honours and the regimental colour a variation of the Union Flag with the battle honours embroidered. The king&#x27;s colours of any additional battalions from these regiments (currently held by the five incremental companies from four out of the six regiments) feature a Union Flag canton at the top corner.

=====Additional colours=====
*The Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards each have at least one state colour; this is usually crimson with various regimental devices and honours, and the royal cypher at the corners of it. They are only used by guards of honour from any unit from these regiments, not found by the King&#x27;s Guard, mounted on state occasions when the King is present. They are only lowered to the King and Queen and on state occasions only when the king is present, even if the guard of honour is mounted in honour of some other personage. The colour design is larger than the normal colours of the Guards Division used in ceremonies.
*The 1st Battalion, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment, as the lineal descendant, bears the Third Colour initially borne by the 2nd Regiment of Foot, later renamed the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) which, for one reason or another, was never taken away from the regiment in the 18th century when new regulations on colours were implemented.
*The 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers bears the Drummer&#x27;s Colour awarded after the Battle of Wilhelmsthal to the 5th Regiment of Foot, (later The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) of which it is the direct descendant.
*The 3rd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington&#x27;s), as the linear descendant, carries the honorary King&#x27;s and Regimental Colours that were given to the 76th Regiment of Foot by the Honourable East India Company following their actions at Delhi and Allyghur.
*The Royal Highland Fusiliers 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland carries the Assaye Colour awarded as an honorary colour to the 74th Regiment of Foot following the Battle of Assaye, which is paraded every year on Assaye Day.
* The Honourable Artillery Company has both a stand of colours (king&#x27;s and regimental) and guns. The latter are also regarded as colours and accorded the same compliments just as the Royal Artillery regard their guns as their colours.

=====Rifle regiments=====
By tradition, rifle regiments do not carry colours; this goes back to their formation, when they were used as skirmishers and sharpshooters. While individual units may have had banners or pennants to distinguish themselves from other units, regiments as a whole never needed a full stand of colours. Today, the two rifle regiments in the British Army, The Rifles and the Royal Gurkha Rifles carry their battle honours on their drums, while the Royal Green Jackets also had theirs inscribed on their cap badge; this tradition is maintained by The Rifles, who wear the Maltese cross badge of the Royal Green Jackets, inscribed with the regimental honours, as the belt badge. In place of a regimental colour, the Gurkhas carry the Queen&#x27;s Truncheon awarded in 1863.

The Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment was the first modern non-British regiment to receive truncheons when they were awarded to that unit in 2017. In 2019, a similar truncheon, the Rana Parashuwa, was granted to the Sri Lanka Army Special Forces Regiment, the first of their kind granted to a Commonwealth special forces formation. Formerly, the Malaysian Army Royal Ranger Regiment was granted a regimental truncheon in 1966.

In India, colours or banners are given instead of truncheons, following Russian practice and in line with the ancient Indian traditions of old, to all the rifle and scout infantry regiments by the president of India.

=====Colours in the cavalry regiments=====
In the British Army&#x27;s cavalry units, the king&#x27;s cavalry standard and the regimental standard (for the heavy cavalry) and the king&#x27;s cavalry guidons and regimental guidons (for the light cavalry) are the equivalents to the line infantry colours. The king&#x27;s standard is crimson with the royal coat of arms and cypher, plus the regimental honours, while the regimental (squadron/union) standard has an adaptable background colour per unit (the colour is sometimes scarlet) and includes sometimes the Union Badge below the crown and the royal cypher at the sides of the badge, with the unit honours below. The light cavalry guidon is swallow-tailed and includes the regimental coat of arms and honours. Before the 1950s, however, Timpani in the drumhorses (and later snare, bass and tenor drums in the dismounted bands) carried the regimental honours and insignia of the light cavalry regiments. For dragoon guards regiments, the sequence is mixed, since these regiments have a king&#x27;s cavalry standard and regimental guidons.

The Household Cavalry has the following unique colours:

* The Life Guards: King&#x27;s cavalry standard only
* The Blues and Royals: King&#x27;s cavalry standard, regimental guidon

=====Embellishments=====
Woven onto the colours are battle honours; the king&#x27;s colour has honours from the First World War and Second World War, while the regimental colour has honours from other campaigns. The regimental colour can also have other distinctions, including antecedent emblems and unique honours; one significant example is the Sphinx emblem carried by regiments who took part in the Egypt campaign of 1801. The Foot Guards carry battle honours from all engagements in both of their colours. If the regiment has more than a single battalion, then there are identifying marks on the colours to show which battalion they belong to.

There are various other embellishments that can be added to the colours on various occasions:
*On anniversaries of various battle honours, and certain other events, a laurel wreath is added to the top of the pike.
*Battle honour equivalents awarded by foreign countries may be added to the colours, subject to permission being given by the head of state. In the Commonwealth, three infantry battalions are permitted to display the blue streamer that signifies the Presidential Unit Citation/Distinguished Unit Citation (PUC), which is the highest collective award given by the United States:
**2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry
**3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
**6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment

In the United Kingdom, 41 Commando, Royal Marines, and the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, were also awarded the PUC and permitted to display the streamer of their regimental colours.

Because of their importance to the regiment, prior to a new stand of colours being presented, they are consecrated.

=====Royal Air Force=====

RAF colours are made of sky blue silk and measure approximately . The following colours have been awarded:

*RAF College, Cranwell, approved 27 December 1947, presented 6 July 1948.
*The RAF in the UK, approved 27 December 1947, presented, 16 May 1951.
*No. 1 School of Technical Training RAF, approved 27 December 1947, presented 25 July 1952.
*RAF Regiment, presented 17 March 1953.
*Near East Air Force, presented 14 October 1960, laid up 31 May 1976.
*Far East Air Force, presented 13 July 1961, laid up 30 January 1972.
*Central Flying School, presented 26 June 1969.
*RAF Germany, presented 16 September 1970, laid up 27 June 1993.
*Royal Auxiliary Air Force, presented 12 June 1989.
*RAF Halton, presented 31 October 1997.
*Royal Air Force Regiment, presented July 2017.

The King&#x27;s colour for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom is a variation of the RAF Ensign with its dimensions altered. The RAF Roundel is moved to the lower fly, with its place in the centre again taken by the royal cypher surmounted by the crown. Other colours feature the unit&#x27;s badge in the centre with the royal cypher and crown in the first quarter.

The RAF&#x27;s squadron standards are its counterpart to the regimental colours. They are in air force blue surrounded by a gold fringe, with the squadron insignia and honours.

=====Royal Hospital, Chelsea=====
The Royal Hospital, Chelsea had neither colours nor other distinctive device during its entire history, until 2002 when Queen Elizabeth II presented the hospital with the Sovereign&#x27;s Mace. This is now paraded by a party of in-pensioners at all of the Royal Hospital&#x27;s ceremonial events.

=====Royal Marines=====
The Corps of Royal Marines has a single pattern king&#x27;s colour, which is the Union Flag with the foul anchor and the reigning sovereign&#x27;s cypher interlaced in the centre. Above is a scroll with the single battle honour Gibraltar surmounted by St Edward&#x27;s Crown. Below is the globe (which represents the many battle honours the Royal Marines had earned) surrounded by a laurel wreath (which represents the Battle of Belle Isle) and below this is a scroll with the corps&#x27; motto. Each of the four commandos (the battalion-sized formations that make up the bulk of the corps) has a King&#x27;s colour, with the only difference being the colour of the cords and tassels. Each commando also has its own regimental colour. The regimental colour is a dark blue flag (because the corps is classed as a &#x27;royal regiment&#x27;) with a small Union Flag at the pike head. The colour carries similar central embellishments as the king&#x27;s colour, with the exception that the cypher of George IV replaces that of the reigning monarch and the unit numeral is below. The royal cypher is at the other corners. The regimental colours also have the coloured cords and tassels, which are gold combined with the following colours:

*40 Commando: Light blue
*42 Commando: White
*43 Commando: Old gold and scarlet
*45 Commando: Red

The former 41 Commando was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its service in the Korean War, and was thus permitted to carry the streamer on its Regimental Colour.

=====Royal Navy=====
The colours of His Majesty&#x27;s ships in the Royal Navy consist of:

* a White Ensign (worn at the stern, or from the gaff or main yardarm when at sea);
* a Union Jack (worn at the ship&#x27;s jackstaff at the bow when not underway or when the ship is dressed);
* a Masthead pennant (worn at the masthead, except when displaced by an admiral&#x27;s flag or commodore&#x27;s broad pennant).

In addition, each principal command in the Royal Navy also has its own king&#x27;s colour which is a variation of the White Ensign, with its dimensions altered to mirror those of the colours of infantry regiments. In the centre is the royal cypher of the reigning monarch within the Garter, surmounted by the crown.

Unlike the colours of regiments in the Army, the king&#x27;s colours of the Royal Navy are identical with no battle honours. The following units hold a king&#x27;s colour of the Royal Navy:

* Naval Aviation Command (ACOS (AV)), HMS &quot;Heron&quot;)
* Submarine Command (CAPTFASFLOT), HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;)
* Fleet (CINCFLEET HQ)
* Britannia Royal Naval College
* Surface Flotilla (MWS, )
* Royal Naval Reserve (COMMARRES, )

The Royal Fleet Auxiliary also holds a king&#x27;s colour, unique for a civilian organisation. It is a variation of the RFA&#x27;s Blue Ensign, with the dimensions altered to mirror the Royal Navy King&#x27;s Colour. It has the same royal cypher in the centre.

===Europe===
==== Belgium ====
Infantry units have a / , a square vertical tricolour of black, yellow, and red based on the national flag within a 15 mm wide gold fringe, the whole being 90 cm square. The names of battle honours for which the unit was cited are embroidered in gold in French on the obverse and in Dutch on the reverse, in straight lines.

==== Denmark ====
Danish Navy, Army and Air Force units carry a unit colour () and for the Life Guards a battalion colour (), which measures 105 × 140 cm, former horse units a slightly smaller guidon. The flag is a variation of the Dannebrog, with a curvilinear white Dannebrog cross, called the Mantova cross, set with its centre about one-half the width of the hoist from the hoist edge. The royal cypher is embroidered in gold over the centre of the cross, the unit badge in gold in the upper hoist, and the unit number, name or both in gold in the lower hoist. Some regiments have additional marks in the upper fly. The Jyske Dragonregiment, for instance, has Prince Henrik&#x27;s cipher in the upper fly. The finial is an ornate gold openwork spearhead with the royal cypher in the centre. Attached below the spearhead can be one or more campaign streamers (). The colour is decorated with a gold cord with two tassels and bordered with a thin strip of gold cord. The sleeve holding the colour to the pike is attached with ornamental nails, the first three of which represent the sovereign, the Fatherland, and the Union.

====Finland====
Units of the Finnish Defence Forces have a single colour. The colours are either active or traditional. An active colour belongs to a brigade or an equivalent unit in the FDF. A traditional Colour belongs to a battalion or a regiment that has formerly been separate, but is now part of a brigade. The difference between an active and traditional Colour is the way of presenting them. The active colour always has a guard of two officers, while a traditional Colour is borne without one. The military oath is always given in the presence of the active colour of the unit.

Finnish military heraldry is a mixture of Scandinavian and Russian tradition. The colours are usually modeled after Swedish regimental flags of the 17th century, but some units carry flags reminiscent of Russian or German traditions. Colours often bear the emblem of the province where a unit is located. They also commonly feature the traditional colours of a service branch or a shared design element, for example the black flags of most engineer units. There were no battle honours awarded during the Continuation War (co-belligerent with Nazi Germany), but some units have battle honours from the Finnish Civil War and the Winter War.

Units and institutions of the Finnish Defence Forces which have not received a colour of their own use the unadorned swallow-tailed Flag of Finland as their State Colour, and the oath of service for NCOs and volunteer enlisted personnel assigned to these units are given in its presence.

====France====
In January 1188, in a meeting between Henry II of England and Philip II of France, it was agreed that both would go on a crusade, and that Henry II would use a white cross and Philip II would use a red cross. Later on, this usage was inverted, and the English took to using a red cross on white, and the French a white cross on red.

=====Background=====
As the use of regimental colours spread in Europe, the habit developed of using a symmetric white cross as the basis of the design of the French regimental flags, and by the 18th century almost every regiment had a white cross. The regiments were distinguished by the colours of the cantons.

After the French Revolution and the appearance of the new &quot;Tricolore&quot;, crosses disappear in 1794 and various arrangements of the tricolour come into use. Napoleon standardizes first in 1804 to a white field chape-chausse of red and blue, and in 1812 to the modern French flag. Atop of the staff of colours of the Napoleonic army the Imperial Eagle (modelled after the Ancient Roman &quot;Aquila&quot;) was placed, which actually rose to be more important symbol of the regiment than colours itself.

===== Battle honours on current colours =====
The modern French Armed Forces are not officially considered to be the successors of the Royal Army and Navy, although many of their individual units trace their histories to before the foundation of the First Republic. Accordingly, battles fought and won by the Royal Army and Navy before the French Revolution (such as Patay, Fontenoy, Chesapeake, Porto Praya and so on) do not appear as battle honours on regimental colours. The names of battles of the old times, however, which are rightly still considered as glorious by the modern French Army, are honoured by being given to ships or armoured vehicles, and remembered by anniversaries.

As an example, the 1st Infantry Regiment, founded in 1479 during the reign of Louis XI, has fought a number of battles since the 15th century, but its battle honours are only recorded from 1792 onwards:

*Valmy 1792
*Fleurus 1794
*Moeskirch 1800
*Biberach 1800
*Miliana 1842
*Guise 1914
*Verdun – L&#x27;Yser 1916–1917
*La Somme 1916
*L&#x27;Ourcq 1918
*Résistance Berry 1944
*AFN 1952–1962.

* recommendation () 808 EMM/CAB of 5 December 1985 rules what sorts of units can be given colours, abiding to previous regulations of joint services;
* decision 12350/SGA/DPMA/SHD/DAT of 14 September 2007 deals with the inscriptions of battle honours upon the flags and standards of the units of the Army, the Defence Health service and the Military Fuel Service;
* government order of 19 November 2004 relates to the award of the &quot;AFN 1952–1962&quot; battle honour to flags and standards of Army and Services units.

=====Army in general=====
* Regimental colours of units which are traditionally on foot, such as Infantry regiments of the line, Marine Infantry, Foreign Legion Infantry, Parachute Infantry, Engineers, Signal Corps and Military Colleges are called (flags).
* Regimental colours of the (traditionally) mounted units of the Armoured Cavalry Branch and other cavalry units such as Dragoon Paratroopers, Hussar Paratroopers, Legion Cavalry, Artillery (including Marine Artillery, Legion Artillery, etc.), Transportation, Army Aviation, and Materiel, are called (standards).

Regimental colours are 90 cm × 90 cm silk square flags – standards are smaller: 64 cm × 64 cm – surrounded by a golden fringe. Both are set on a stave (2.11 m long and 32 mm diameter – staves for standards are slightly shorter) ended by a 38 cm pike-shaped finial with a cartouche bearing the initials &quot;RF&quot; for on one side, and the name or number of the unit on the other side.

The cravate hanging from the pike is made of two tricolour silk ribbons, 90 cm long and 24 cm wide, ended by an 8 cm gold fringe on which the unit number or monogram is embroidered in gold, encircled by an oak and laurel wreath. French decorations and fourragères awarded to the unit are pinned or tied to the cravate; foreign awards and decorations are borne on a red velvet cushion.

All writings on the colour are embroidered in gold, as well the unit number (or monogram) encircled in antique oak and laurel wreath in each corner of the colour.

Obverse of a colour:

* République française
* (Name of the unit)

Reverse of a colour:

* Honneur (Honour)
* Et (and)
* Patrie (Fatherland)
* (Battle Honours)

=====Rifle battalions (chasseurs à pied)=====
By tradition, all the Army&#x27;s rifle battalions (the together with the ) share a single collective colour. Individual battalions have pennants () and the flag of the Rifles () is held each year in turn by a different rifle battalion. As a result, the single flag displays all the battle honours earned by every rifle battalion.

=====Other specific colours=====
* Since 1844, the obverse of Foreign Legion regimental colours do not carry the motto &quot; but &quot; (Honour and Fidelity). This motto was originally written on the flags of the Swiss regiments in French service, such as the (85th Infantry of the line).
* The École polytechnique, as a military college, also has a colour which does not carry &quot; but instead &quot; (For the Fatherland, Sciences and Glory). The reverse of the École polytechnique&#x27;s colour has one battle honour written under the motto: , awarded in 1901 by President Émile Loubet.
* Since 1880, the motto of the Paris Fire Brigade (which is a military unit belonging to the Engineering Arm), &quot; (Devotion and Discipline), is written under &quot;.
* The reverse of the Saint-Cyr Military College&#x27;s colour has seven lines: (Honour / and / Fatherland / They study for victory / First / battalion / of France).

===== Air Force =====
The colours of Air Force () units are by all means similar to those of the Army from which it separated as an independent military arm in 1933. Colours are generally not bestowed to Air Army units smaller than (wings), land combat regiments, air force bases, instruction centres or air force colleges.

===== National Gendarmerie =====
The units of the National Gendarmerie () have colours which are very similar to those of the Land Army. Each region (formerly &quot;legion&quot;), instruction centre, college or Republican Guard Regiment has its flag or standard, altogether 56 flags and 2 standards. The reverse of colours of the Departmental Gendarmerie units and Gendarmerie instruction centres have the same motto as the Land Army units (), but the colours of the Mobile Gendarmerie have their own particular motto: (Valour and Discipline). Most subordinate or smaller units use 50 cm large × 40 cm high pennants.

The National Gendarmerie also has a common flag, under the guard of the Director-general, on which five battle honours are registered:

*Hondschoote 1793
*Villodrigo 1812
*Taguin 1843
*Sébastopol 1855
*Indochine 1945–1954

===== National Navy =====
The Colours worn by the ships of the National Navy () consist of the National Ensign and the jack:

* the National Ensign is flown at the stern and at the bowsprit if not replaced there by the FNFL jack or a military award jack;
* the FNFL jack is flown at the ship&#x27;s jackstaff if the ship has fought with the Free French Naval Forces, or is named after such a ship;
* military award jacks may also be flown at the ship&#x27;s jackstaff if the ship has received mention in dispatches (in which case crew members wear the corresponding ).

Currently, only eight individual National Navy units have colours other than the National Ensign or the FNFL jack. Under recommendation 808 EMM/CAB of 5 December 1985, naval units to which colours can be bestowed must be those with manpower equivalent to that of a regiment, which are specialised in combat or services on land (or corps which have inherited their traditions from such units), and naval instruction centres or colleges. The flags are quite similar to those of Land Army units, the difference being the wreaths in corners which encircle anchors instead of the name of unit, except for the Naval Gunners (initials &quot;CM&quot;) and the Fleet Engineering Cadets College (initials &quot;EAMF&quot;).

As of today, these units are (between brackets is where the colours are currently kept):

*the – the 1st Naval Fusiliers Regiment (Naval Fusiliers College);
*the – the Naval Fusiliers Half-Brigade (Cherbourg Naval Fusiliers Company);
*the – the Naval Gunners (Saint-Mandrier Naval Instruction Centre);
*the – the Naval College (Poulmic Schools Group);
*the – the Fleet Military College (Poulmic Schools Group);
*the – the Cabin Boys College (Brest Naval Instruction Centre);
*the &#x27; – the Fleet Engineering Cadets College (Saint-Mandrier Naval Instruction Centre);
*the – the Marseille Marine Fire Battalion (The Marseille Marine Fire Battalion).

=====French influence=====
======Nations of the former French Empire======
Many of today&#x27;s armed forces of independent countries that once were part of the French Empire share customs and traditions closely similar if not identical to those of the French military regarding organisation of military arms, army and navy rank structures and uniform styles. Indeed, in countries where the decolonisation process had been conducted through peaceful political negotiations (chiefly French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa), French colonial units were sometimes directly inherited by the former colonies where they had been raised to form the basis of the new national armies. This legacy not only included colour etiquette (the way colours are respected, taken care of and paraded), but also design, adapted to new national flag designs.

On the contrary, in countries where independence came as the aftermath of bloody wars of liberation, such as in Vietnam and Algeria, due to the Cold War context, French military culture was strongly rejected often only to be replaced by communist Soviet or Chinese style military culture (colours, ranks, uniforms, parade pace, etc.).

======Other nations======
As one of the World&#x27;s great powers together with Great Britain, France did not only exercise its influence by conquest, but also by the prestige of its military. At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, France&#x27;s army and Britain&#x27;s navy were each regarded as the most powerful forces ever on land and at sea. This lead many a military to copy both powers&#x27; military and naval cultures. As most navies in the World adopted the British naval looks (double-breasted navy blue jacket and peaked cap for officer, blue jean collar for ratings, etc.), numerous land armies adopted French-inspired uniforms during the 1860s and 1870s (both Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, the Chilean Army of the War of the Pacific, the Imperial Russian Army, etc.) and even sometimes imported types of French units (e.g. Zouave regiments). France&#x27;s influence on military fashion dimmed for the time being after the unexpected French defeat ending the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. Many armies then changed to adopt Prussian military style (as a perfect example of this trend, Chilean soldiers traded their kepis for ).

As far as regimental colours are concerned, French influence was mainly to be seen in armies of smaller European powers with strong cultural, economical or political ties to France, notably in such countries whose national flag itself was patterned after the French national flag, such as Belgium or Romania.

====Germany====
Units of the Bundeswehr have only a single Colour. The is a square version of the national flag with the Bundesadler (national shield) overall in the centre. The flag is surrounded by a black, red, and gold lacework border and edged on three sides by gold fringe. The finial is a gilt bronze openwork spearhead surrounding a black and silver Iron Cross. Below the finial, a streamer is attached with the unit badge at the top and its designation embroidered in gold at the end. These streamers are red for army (Heer) units, blue for the navy (Marine), and white for the air force (Luftwaffe). The streamer is the same length as the hoist of the flag.

The tradition was also observed by the National People&#x27;s Army of East Germany, whose unit colours mirrored the national flag.

Until the Second World War German military units maintained colours of the Prussian pattern regardless of service branch, while the Waffen-SS followed the national flag pattern.

====Greece====
Traditionally, Army infantry and tank/cavalry regiments have a single colour/standard or war flag (). This is blue, with a white cross and features St George and the Dragon in the centre. The flag has no distinguishing features for individual regiments, although battle honours are sometimes added to the flag; the regiment&#x27;s identity is inscribed on the flagstaff. The pattern has been in use since the 1830s, with no changes between the periods of monarchy or republic. The Hellenic Army Academy has also been awarded a war flag, its cadets having participated in the Battle of Crete in 1941. Similar flags exist also for the Air Force, featuring the archangel Michael. Recently war flags were assigned to the Army NCO Academy and the Police Academy.

Unlike the Army, Police and Air Force, the Hellenic Navy uses as both the naval ensign and national colour the flag that later became the modern official national Flag of Greece. The Hellenic Coast Guard and the Hellenic Fire Service use the Navy pattern.

====Holy See====


The flag of the Swiss Guard, the army of the Vatican City, consists of four-quarters. The Coat of Arms of the current pope is in the first quarter, while the arms of Pope Julius II are in the fourth quarter. In the second and third quarters are horizontal stripes of red, yellow and blue, the colours of the unit&#x27;s uniforms.

The flag also has the coat of arms of the commander within a wreath, on a background of the colour of his canton. The design of the flag changes with the election of a new pope and the appointment of a new commander.

====Hungary====
The 120 cm × 140 cm Unit colour of the Hungarian Defence Force is the current regulation colour of all Hungarian Defence Forces units since 15 March 1991. The flag is made of white fibres-satin. The height of the coat of arms with the crown is 57, and the width is 58 cm along with the crown. The coat of arms is made of silk with gold and silver embroidery. The edges of the flagship are surrounded by 11–11, and 9–9, 10 cm, red and green flames on the longer sides, extending 15 centimetres. The flames of the flames start and end on each side with a red colour, with the flaming tongues separated by a green circle in the four corners of the flag. The flagpole has a 5 mmm national-colour silk ribbon on its 3 free edges that do not fit the rod, with 10–10 centimetres national colour silk ribs on two free tips. The white part of the flagpole outside the party is twisted once on the pole, fixed with 3 equally spaced brass nails - 25-25-25 mm equally spaced. The flagpole is a 21-centimeter long, stylized leaf-shaped sandblasted brass, on both sides with a baroque, bronze Coat of arms of Hungary, without shield holders. The rod is 238 centimetres long, cylindrical, scarlet-lacquered, bottom-foldable in the lower third. Brass rings at the pole separation lines and a brass cap at the bottom end.

====Italy====
The colour () for army units (other than cavalry) is a square version of the national tricolour in silk, 99 cm × 99 cm. It is mounted on a pike 2.2 m long, made of wood covered with green velvet and decorated with ornate brass nails arranged in a spiral. The pike is topped by a 35 cm high finial consisting of an ornate gilt brass spearhead chased with a five-pointed star and the monogram RI (for ), which is in turn mounted atop a gilt brass ball on which is the name and date of establishment of the unit. The pike is adorned with two silver cords 67 cm long, each with a 10 cm long silver tassel and a blue silk cravat 8 cm × 66 cm with an 8 cm silver fringe at each end, to which the unit&#x27;s decorations are pinned, the ribbons of the decorations overlapping so that the medals hang down the cravat. Italian Army cavalry units carry a (standard) of the same pattern as the , but which measures 60 cm × 60 cm.

==== Lithuania ====
Lithuania&#x27;s military colours under the Lithuanian Armed Forces tend to follow a mix of the Russian and British practice, as well as of US tradition, with the national flag being designated as a National Colour, but only flown by guards of honour in ceremonies. Unit colours of the Land Forces follow the Imperial Russian pattern, with the fringe in gold or bi-colour of red/green and bearing Vytis (obverse) and unit emblem (reverse) in the centre. The Naval Forces uses a ceremonial form of the naval ensign as an overall branch colour with gold fringe following British precedence.

====Netherlands====
In the Dutch armed forces, the colour (or standard in case of the mounted (i.e. cavalry and field and horse artillery) regiments) is orange (except for the colour of the midshipman corps, which is red). All are gold fringed.

On the obverse is the royal cypher of the monarch that gave the regiment its (original) colour, with the unit&#x27;s name underneath (including the year the regiment or corps was established), both in gold; around the four edges is a laurel branch. Battle honours are added in the corners of the obverse and sometimes also on the left and right of the royal cypher; if additional honours are awarded, they are placed on streamers that are attached to the pike until the presentation of a new colour. Battle honours refer to places (e.g. Waterloo or Rotterdam), areas (West-Java or Afghanistan) (seas included, for example Java-zee), or to a military campaign (Tiendaagse Veldtocht or Veldtocht van 1815); the year or years of engagement are always added, except on the colours of the Netherlands Marine Corps.

On the reverse is the arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands without the mantle. The shield is blue and is strewn with small upright rectangles; the main device is a crowned rampant lion, holding a sword in its upper paw and a bundle of seven arrows in its lower paw. The lion and rectangles are gold, whilst the blade of the sword is silver. Supporting the shield on either side is a gold rampant lion, facing outwards towards the viewer. There is a gold crown above the shield; whilst below it is a blue scroll with the royal motto in gold. The shield and lions are surrounded by a wreath of green palm and oak leaves tied together with an orange and blue ribbon, and there is another wavy gold laurel wreath around the four edges.

The Military Order of William or other decorations are attached to the pike when awarded. The pike has a finial of a lion on a plinth holding a sword and a bunch of seven arrows. Traditionally a colour is 87 cm × 87 cm (with a pike 2.50 m long). Guards regiments carry the same colour, with some differing details. The same applies to the colours carried by the Royal Military Academy and the Royal Military School. Standards measure 50 cm × 50 cm with a pike 2 m long.

Only Regiment van Heutsz has a full British-styled stand as a variant of the national flag used by the regiment in the Korean War is used as the Regimental Colour with the orange colour as the King&#x27;s Colour (or Queen&#x27;s).

====Norway====
Norwegian infantry units have a stand of colours – the first (King&#x27;s Colour) is the national flag, while the second (Regimental Colour) is unique to each unit:
*Infantry: Norwegian line infantry units carry regimental colours, either of a solid colour or divided vertically into two or three stripes, with the Norwegian lion in the centre, the name of the unit, and battle honours embroidered on the field. The colours vary by regiment and derive either from historic associations with predecessor regiments or from the colours of the regiment&#x27;s oldest known uniform.
*Guards: The Royal Norwegian Guards regiment has a regimental colour that is all white, again with the lion in the centre, and with the royal cypher of the reigning monarch in each corner.

====Poland====
The standard military colours of the Polish Armed Forces are in red and white, with the design tracing back to the Polish Second Republic, a standardized form based on earlier colours. The motto of the Armed Forces, &quot;God, Honour, Fatherland&quot; () are at the reverse while the Polish military eagle (which differs per service) surrounded by a gold wreath is at the centre of the obverse. The unit&#x27;s name is inscribed on the obverse. The eagle is also featured as the finial in all colours.

====Portugal====
Each of the commands, units, forces and establishments of the Portuguese Armed Forces has a , which is considered the parade version of the Flag of Portugal. The National Republican Guard, the Public Security Police and some fire departments also have national colours.

The traditional distinction between colours (, literally &quot;flags&quot;) - carried by foot units - and standards () - carried by mounted units - was abolished in the 1960s, with all of them being uniformly reclassified as &quot;national standards&quot; (). At the same time, another type of standard was introduced, this being the heraldic standard, each of which reflects the particular heraldic symbology of the corresponding unit.

The official model for the military colours was established in 1911 and states that they should measure 120 cm in the hoist by 130 cm in the fly, the field being vertically divided in green and red, with the National coat of arms in the centre, surrounded by two golden olive branches tied by a white scroll containing the motto (This is my Beloved Blissful Fatherland). Despite the existence of this official model, the various branches of the Armed Forces adopted different models of colours over the years, with various designs and dimensions.

In March 2020, a uniform model of national colours was adopted for all the branches. This is based in the 1911 official model, but measuring 120 cm both in the hoist and in the fly. The name of the unit, its heraldic symbol and their battle honours are embroidered in a gravat attached to the base of the finial, the colour of the gravate varying accordingly with the branch of service. Naval units were allowed to keep the traditional Order of Christ Cross embroidered in the canton of the cloth of their national colours. The several commands, units, forces and establishments of the Armed Forces will have to replace their old national colours by the new model within 10 years.

The national colours of the National Republican Guard and of the Public Security Police follow the 1911 model and continue to keep the traditional practice of having the names of the units inside white scrolls which are inserted on the field of the flag itself.

====Romania====
According to the Romanian General Staff, &quot;The military colours () are the symbol of military honour, bravery and glory. They evoke the past struggle of the Romanian people for national liberty and the traditions of unity, reminding each soldier of his sacred duty to serve the Fatherland with trust, and to defend at all costs the unity, sovereignty and independence of Romania&quot;.

The military colours are granted to military units by presidential decree, on the advice of the Minister of National Defence, the Minister of Internal Affairs or the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service. According to the Ministry of National Defence, the complete description of this military insignia is as follows:

The military colours of Romania are made of double silk cloth and have dimensions of 100 × 66 cm (2:3 ratio). The canvas has the colours of the Romanian flag and its obverse is identical with the reverse. The national coat of arms, measuring 29 × 21.5 cm, is applied in the middle of the yellow stripe, 18 cm above its base. In each corner, 5 cm from the edge of the canvas, is sewed a wreath of oak leaves, which surrounds the weapon signs, all of golden thread:

* two crossed swords for land forces units
* a helicopter blade juxtaposed over a pair of wings in downward flight, a radar and a crossed rocket and telescope for the Air Force
* an anchor for the Naval Forces
* the letter J in a rhombus over two crossed swords for gendarmerie units
* the emblem of the Romanian Intelligence Service for its units

The three sides of the flag not attached to the pole are decorated with fringes of golden thread (5–7 cm long) and tassels of the same material (10–12 cm long) hang from the corners of the fly. The flag is attached to the pole by an antioxidant metal rod 70 cm long.

The pole, of brown wood, is 240 cm high and 3.5 cm in diameter. A brass cylinder is at the base, 4 cm long and closed on the bottom. The rod is attached to the pole by a brass ring, gilt on its lower part, and a 6 cm high cylindrical protective tube of the same material and gilt on its upper part. The ring (3.2 cm high) is inscribed with the name of the unit. Another brass cylinder is placed on the tip of the pole, 6 cm long and of brass. The eagle (similar to the Roman aquila), of gilt copper, sheet, 15 cm high and 11.5 cm wide, is placed over this. Looking rightward, the eagle&#x27;s wings are pointed downward and it holds the thunderbolts of Jupiter in its talons. It is placed on a parallelepipedal support of the same metal (10 × 3.5 × 2 cm), which has a 3.4 cm high ornament on its lower part. The support is screwed onto the brass cylinder and has inscribed into the front the motto (&quot;Honour and Fatherland&quot;). The name of the respective unit is engraved into the reverse.

Other features of the military colours are a tie for attaching decorations, six sashes for the armed escort of the colour guard and the colour ensign and a protective cover of impermeable fabric.

The military colours of navy vessels are identical to their ensign. The ensign is in turn identical to the national flag, being made of ordinary canvas in various dimensions, according to the ship&#x27;s rank, size and place of hoisting. They are flown in their vessels in accordance with relevant regulations.

==== Russia and Soviet Union ====
Until Peter the Great assumed the office and throne of Tsar in 1685, various flag designs were used by land and naval units of Imperial Russia.

In the 18th century the Imperial Russian Army started to have colours of its own. Starting from the 1730s, Cross style flags in the colours of the various military units appeared in various units: large flags for the infantry and the other arms and small flags for the cavalry and horse artillery. These flags mirrored the Commonwealth military colours of today, with one colour set as the state colour and the rest as the regimental and battalion or squadron colours. 1797 regulations introduced new designs for the infantry—for regular units, the state colour being white with the state emblem and the company, battalion and/or regimental colours using the assigned colours of their units, for the Imperial Guard a different emblem was used, and the design was identical. New colours were issued in 1800, but only Guards units used them.

Regulations set in 1813 unified infantry unit colours into one. Guards units used the orange and black of the Order of Saint George with the facing colours and unit emblem at the centre.

All these years, the cavalry colours were different.

Naval flags, until 1861–62 (with a brief break in the late 1790s) whilst using the St. Andrew&#x27;s cross in blue on white, mirrored the British Royal Navy.

From 1942 onwards, each regiment in the armed forces of the Soviet Union (especially the Army and Air Force) had its own colour, which was produced to a standard design:

*Obverse: red field, a red star yellow bordered and the full name and number of a military unit/school below. Each unit has its own inscription.
*Reverse: red field, a gold hammer and sickle and the motto &quot;For our Soviet Motherland!&quot; (, )

The colour was gold fringed.

The former designs had a red star on the reverse with the name of the Central Executive Committee and later, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR surrounding it, and the obverse had the unit inscription below the coat of arms of the Soviet Union, which had the Soviet Union state motto (&quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;) and the red star with the hammer and sickle inside (both were on the flag of the Soviet Union) above it (the latter was near the hoist). Naval flags until 1935 sported different designs. (Distinguished units would be given a second colour, the Revolutionary Red Banner of Honour, by the all-Union CEC (before 1924 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee).)

The Soviet Navy colours had the 1935 official design with them (it was later revised in 1950), with additions for units honoured with the Order of the Red Banner, but in 1964 the Supreme Commander&#x27;s and Defence Minister&#x27;s own naval colour and the colours of the Navy Commander-in-Chief (formerly the Minister for the Navy) and Chief of Naval Operations were issued with different designs used, with the addition of the Armed Forces General Staff&#x27;s own naval colour. The first colour was red with the USSR state arms, the next two had the arms with blue stripes indicating office rank, and the final two were adaptations of the naval ensign (with a different ensign with the rank) plus the stripes. The 1935 design (that of a white field with a blue lower stripe and the red star plus the hammer and sickle above the blue stripe) replaced a much earlier, post-revolutionary naval colours design adopted in 1925. In 1944 a different flag was issued to the Navy for its land based units – the same design used by the Army with a different obverse having the unit name below the naval ensign.

Early flags even had the RKKA and RKKF insignia (the Army General Staff, represented by crossed blue rifles and later became the General Staff&#x27;s naval colour until 1964, the Naval General Staff and the Army Naval Operations Staff, later the flag of the People&#x27;s Comissariat for the Navy on its 1938 creation and was issued with two new colours for the Navy Commissar and Deputy Commissar) beside the hammer and sickle, even the flags of the People&#x27;s Commissar for National Defence and that of the Navy General Staff and the various flags of naval officers which had the ensign on a canton surrounded by a red field, derived from the Navy Commissar&#x27;s. The cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; since 1968 has had a different version of the ensign, flanked by the Order of the Red Banner and of the Order of the October Revolution on the top sides of the star, as the &quot;Aurora&quot; was the only naval recipient of the latter order in 1967 while in 1918, the Order of the Red Banner was conferred to the ship.

=====Regimental colours of the Guards units=====
The colours of those regiments that were classed as &quot;Guards&quot; was slightly different as per 1942 regulations. These had the portrait of Lenin, the motto and the abbreviation &quot;USSR&quot; (, &quot;SSSR&quot;) on the obverse and the small star with hammer and sickle in its centre, unit&#x27;s name and a motto on the reverse of the colour. The mottoes were different for every regiment (for example, those regiments made Guards in the Great Patriotic War bore the motto &quot;Death to the German invaders&quot;, , ). In some Guards Armies and Corps, different designs on the obverse and reverse were used. Even the Lenin portrait was different in these colours. All of them were gold fringed.

The Navy&#x27;s Guards units still had the 1935 design, with the addition of the Guards ribbon below, except for units which were honoured with the Order of the Red Banner and became Guard units later. The difference is in the red five-pointed star, in which Red Banner Guard unit flags had applied the Guards ribbon below aside from the Order of the Red Banner on the star for units that had the order bestowed on their colours earlier. Units which used the 1944 regimental colour design but adapted for the navy&#x27;s guards units included air and marine units which still had the obverse of Army and Air Force guards units standards.

=====Colours of the present-day Russian Armed Forces=====
Since the birth of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the old Soviet unit colours were retained. Starting in 1998, the traditional Imperial Russian Armed Forces flag designs were reinstated; however, the new designs began to appear in the early years of the 21st century in the Army and Air Force. But the Russian Navy&#x27;s old naval colour (St. Andrew&#x27;s cross in blue on a white field) began to be used again in 1992. It has several variations, and the old jack colour of the Soviet Navy (pre-1935) soon became its jack colour, with the red star with the hammer and sickle removed. The unit colours (especially those of the Navy honour guards) have the same design with the unit insignia at the centre of it while Guards units and bemerited and decorated units apply a different version of the colour.

The new Army and Air Force unit colours are square shaped, have a St. Andrew&#x27;s cross in the colours of the Ribbon of Saint George, and with the unit insignia in the middle of the obverse and the national arms at the reverse, with the service branch emblem on the corners. These colours are the basis for similar ones used today in the various Russian uniformed services.

====Spain====
* Standard colours: Units of the Spanish Armed Forces have a single colour based on the national flag. This has the coat of arms in the centre of the flag, surrounded by the regiment&#x27;s name in black lettering. It is fringed in gold. Red and yellow tassels are attached to the finial which have the battle honours embroidered on them. Formerly a white regimental colour with the unit insignia on the middle of a red Cross of Burgundy or at the sides was used by these units until the adoption of the present colours in 1843. Large colours are the standard of infantry formations, small colours for cavalry and artillery.
* Coronelas: Up until the early 20th century, some Spanish regiments had a , or King&#x27;s Colour in addition to their Regimental Colour based on the national flag. Although officially the only colour is the standard one, some older regiments continue to carry a copy of their old which are used on some occasions to maintain regimental traditions. However, the coronelas no longer have any official standing and are not used on official occasions. The design of such colours are white with the royal arms at the centre and the unit insignia and honours at the sides.
* Second order colours – regimental/wing guidons and banners: In Spain&#x27;s Armed Forces, guidons and banners are second order colours, but are smaller (guidons are medium square shaped while banners are small square shaped). Guidons are used by battalions, squadrons and groups (even vessels) in the Armed Forces while the banners are used by companies, troops, flights and batteries. All have different and unique designs with some having the old Burgundy cross on them. These also have the unit insignia in the centre. Like the Regimental Colour, the finials of these colours have the attached unit battle honours and decorations.

====Sweden====
The design of the colours of the Swedish Armed Forces of today dates back to several separate regulations from early 19th century up to the first united regulations of the three fighting services in 1972. The majority of the army colours are dated back to the summarized regulations of 1950. The colours of the Swedish Amphibious Corps (former Swedish Coastal Artillery) were decided in model 1944. The colours of the Swedish Air Force were modelled in 1938. Most older colours are embroidered by hand while younger ones can be both machine and handmade. When a military unit, as regards traditions, is amalgamated with another, both colours will be carried together. In principle this will go on as long as both colours are usable. When one of the two (or more) no longer can be repaired, the unit will be granted a new colour. This new colour will reflect the traditions of both units without altering the prescribed model.

Exceptions from this rule are:

* The Life Guards (LG) which maintains its privilege to present both the colour of the former Svea Life Guards (I 1) and the standard of the former Life Guard Dragoons (K 1)
* The South Scanian Regiment (P 7) which maintains its privilege to present both the colour of the South Scanian Regiment (P 7) and the standard of the former Scanian Dragoon Brigade (, MekB 8)
* The Artillery Regiment (A 9) which maintains its privilege to present both the standard of the Artillery Regiment (A 9) and the honorary standard of the former Wendes Artillery Regiment (A 3)
* The Uppland Regiment (S 1) which maintains its privilege to present both the colour of the former Royal Signal Regiment (S 1) and the colour of the former Royal Uppland Regiment (I 8)

A colour is normally granted to the following by the King, by the Prime Minister or the Commander of the Armed Forces:
* an army unit belonging to the Infantry Branch, the Armoured Troops, the Engineer Troops, the Signal Troops and the Service Troops
* the regiments of the Amphibious Corps
* the wings of the Swedish Air Force

==== Turkey and Ottoman Empire ====
The Ottoman army often used verses from the Quran and Shahada (&quot;There is no god but Allah. Muhammad is the messenger of God&quot;) on their flags. This tradition continued during the First World War. When Ottoman Turkey joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in 1914, it declared a jihad against the Entente States. The modern Ottoman Turkish army used the Ottoman state coat of arms on one side of their standard regimental flags and Shahada on the other. The Ottoman regimental flags consisted of gold writings and the state emblem on a red background. After the empire was abolished in 1922, this practice continued for a while in modern Turkey. 

The Flag of Turkey is used by the Turkish Armed Forces as a National Colour, and thus has distinguishing features:
* the golden TC (Turkish monogram for Republic of Turkey) on the top left corner, surrounded by golden rays
* the regimental name, abbreviated, below the crescent and star in white

It is opened with a ceremony and moves under the command of the Flag Guard.

Flag Guard: Consists of 4 people. The flag bearer holding the flag, two flag guards and the Flag Guard Commander. There are selection criteria for the flag guard. The flag bearer, flag guard and flag officer must be distinguished among their peers with their education and discipline. The flag officer can be in the rank of lieutenant-captain.

In addition, there is a flag in the Security Organization, only in the office of the General Director of Security and the President of the Police Academy. The Security Organization has defined the flag as the symbol of honor of the Security Organization in its own regulations. The flags in the Security Organization have a white tassel and cord, unlike the flags in the Turkish Armed Forces.

All flags salute only the President and foreign Heads of State. As long as the flag is open and visible, it is saluted by everyone standing and with a frontal salute.


==== Ukraine ====

At the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, quadrangular flags with wedge panels on the free end appeared. The most used colors were red, followed by white, blue, and occasionally yellow. The most widely used flag images were crosses, holy and princely symbols and ancestral tridents-bidents. The flag of the Galicia-Volynia principality was blue with a golden lion.

In 1410, Ruthenian troops took part in the Battle of Grunwald on the side of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against their old ally from the time of the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia, the Teutonic Order. The Polish chronicler Jan Dlugosz left a description of the banners of the troops from the ruthenian lands who appeared to fight the crusaders.

The Zaporozhian Army received their first flags from foreign monarchs from the 16th century: during the Moldavian campaigns of the Austro-Turkish war and the campaign of the Holy League.In 1646, for the campaign against the Turks, Wladyslav IV Vasa provided a flag: ironically, it was under this banner that the Cossacks won their first resounding victories over the Polish army during the Khmelnytskyj uprising — at Yellow Waters, Korsun, and Pyliavtsi.
According to the system, there were regimental, sotnia and kish banners. Among the flags of the day, rectangular and trapezoidal panels prevailed. The insignia of numerous units had a triangular shape of various shades of red. Instead of a single state flag, the highest heraldic symbol of the Hetmanate was the image of the Archangel Michael on a red background. Most of the flags that have survived to our time contain an equilateral Cossack cross and eight-pointed stars, sometimes combined with images of the crescent moon, a symbol of the Christian-Muslim civilizational confrontation, the latter, from 1572 (in honor of Lepanto), had a pan-European distribution as a symbol of victory in the confrontation with the Islamic threat. From the 18th century, primarily in the Poltava (1717) and Lubny (1758) regiments, two-color flags of yellow and blue became widespread. 

In general, until the second half of the 18th century. there are relatively fragmentary data available, more detailed information from the time of the unification of flags during the time of Kyril Razumovsky: on March 8/18, 1755, he issued a form for the manufacture of flags according to a single model according to the project of Colonel Ivan Kulyabka of Lubny — one side was to contain the Coat of Arms of the Nation, and the other symbol of a military unit. Despite this, the colors and sizes of the flags were arbitrary. Similar standards existed until 1768 - the reign of Peter Rumyantsev, who began to introduce imperial symbols in the Cossack army.

The unification of the banners of the Hetmanate did not in any way affect the ensign of the Zaporozhian Army, the general banner — the Great Banner — still contained Archangel Michael on a red background, the flags of the kurin and palanquins were mostly crimson in color. The banner of sea campaigns with the image of St. Nicholas was white, besides it, after the Oleshkivsk sich period, there was also a titular red banner of imperial origin. Among the kurin banners, the red ones with the image of St. George.

The first Cossack colonizers of the Sloboda region formed the Slobid regiments, the banner of which also featured Christian and religious themes. In total, there were 36 flags in the five regiments, together with the sotnias. The reverse side of the sotnia flags contained the name of the regiment and the sotnia. In contrast to the banners of the rest of the Ukrainian Cossacks, the Slobid banners contained the image of the Mother of God, the patroness of the Cossacks, as the main motif. With the reorganization into regular hussars, the previous symbols of the units were abolished.

In 1792, the Zaporozhians were moved to the Kuban, where the Tmutarakan Principality was located, forming the Black Sea Cossack Army.

Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Tsentralna Rada came to power in Ukraine in spring of 1917, it was forced to promptly put together an army to defend the new republic against their enemies. Nearly all units of the newly created army were detached from the Imperial Russian Army. After the first all-Ukrainian military congress that took place on May 18–21, 1917 in Kyiv, the Ukrainian General Military Committee was created. The committee was placed in charge for creation and restructuring of the army.

The next congress, defying a ban placed by the Russian Provisional Government, took place on June 18–23, 1917 in Kyiv. The main requests of the congress were proclamation of the Ukrainian Democratic Republic, full Ukrainization of army and navy, and an immediate peace treaty.

On January 27, 1918, the Ukrainian Central Rada approved the project of the Ukrainian naval ensign, developed by the Ukrainian Maritime Council (it consisted of two stripes: blue at the top, yellow at the bottom; on the top - the golden sign of Prince Volodymyr - the Trident with a cross at the top), modeled after the British White Ensign.
In 1919, blue-yellow unit colours based on the national flag were adopted for units of both the regular Army of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Ukrainian Galician Army.

With restored independence the Armed Forces of Ukraine adopted a maroon design for its colours, which were gold fringed and contained the official heraldic arms of the armed forces.

Maroon and gold are the colours used in the current military colours used in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with origins in the Imperial Russian Army&#x27;s Cossacks and Ukrainian units. In the obverse the Coat of arms of Ukraine, surrounded by a gold wreath, is at the centre of an Orthodox Cross – both symbols form the emblem of the Armed Forces – with a St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross under it with the same emblem in the sides, with the Armed Forces Motto (&quot;For Ukraine, for her Freedom&quot;) surrounding the emblem and crosses. The unit&#x27;s name is in the reverse. The colour is gold fringed and is mounted on a pole with a trident finial modeled on the national arms. The same design is used in the National Guard of Ukraine but in blue and with the 2015 grenade badge. Active duty NG units sport dark blue colours with the Orthodox Cross, grenade and the coat of arms at the corners.

Only the 93rd Mechanized Brigade (Ground Forces), the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces and the Ukrainian Marine Corps have been granted additional colours so far in addition to the official maroon unit colours.

The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine shares a similar colour design to the Armed Forces but with the green colour added to distinguish its units.

====Yugoslavia and post-Yugoslav nations====
The first Yugoslav military colours came about when the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established in 1918. These were the square versions of the Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with the state coat of arms and the motto of the Yugoslav Royal Army. The unit names were attached to a ribbon at the pole. The colours were inspired by the military colours of Serbia and of the Croat, Slovene and Bosnian military units of resistance against Austria-Hungary during the First World War.

With the birth of the communist Partisans in 1941 in time for the Second World War, their flags showed the same Pan-Slavic colours on them (arranged according to nationality) but this time a red star was added in the middle. The naval units had a different ensign used and these flags became the basis for the military colours of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia at the time of its 1943 proclamation.

By the time, these flags had the unit name on the pole pennants and were gold fringed. The Partisan General Staff had their own version of it.

Post-war colours (from 1947, when the nation became a Federal People&#x27;s Republic) used various flag design with the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army motto in Serbo-Croatian (&quot;For the freedom and independence of the socialist fatherland&quot;) both in Cyrillic and Latin and differed per unit or service arm of the YPA, but was longer and were gold fringed. Just as before, the unit name stayed on the attached ribbon. Both the Flag of Yugoslavia and the flag of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia were used as National Colours in parades. Unique colours were issued to the Navy, to YPA reserve units and the Territorial Defence Forces of the republics.

Today all the nations of the former Yugoslavia have separate colour traditions per armed forces, but keep their unique appearance.

===== Serbia =====
The Serbian Armed Forces colour design is very much unique, while gold fringe can be seen in these colours. At the obverse is the national flag design, a tricolour with the national coat of arms in the center of the colour, while the emblem and facing colour of the unit represented (combat formation or support unit) is in the reverse.

===North America===
==== Cuba ====
Cuba&#x27;s military colours under the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces tend to follow a mix of the Soviet and US practice, as the Cuban flag is treated as a National Colour.

* Regiments/Wings: bicolour vertical flag with a white field in the centre with the Coat of arms of Cuba and the service or branch colour at the sides
* Infantry Divisions of the Revolutionary Army, Territorial Troops Militias, Youth Labour Army and Camilio Cienfuegos Military Schools System: Red with coat of arms with title on gold or white surrounding
* Armoured Divisions: Black with coat of arms with title on white
* Air Force Brigades: Blue with coat of arms with title on white surrounding
* Antonio Maceo Military College and Jose Maceo Military College: Red and Black with coat of arms
* Naval Academy: White with two blue stripes

==== El Salvador ====
El Salvador&#x27;s military colours under the Salvadoran Armed Forces heavily follow US models, as the Salvadoran flag, with gold fringe, is treated as a National Colour- but its design is based on the American Civil War example and Argentine and Mexican precedence: the name of the unit is on the bottom blue stripe of the colour in gold lettering.

==== Honduras ====
Honduran military colours under the Honduran Armed Forces heavily follow US models, as the Honduran flag is treated as a National Colour.

====Mexico====
The Mexican Armed Forces use the Flag of Mexico as the National Colour, with the unit inscription below the Coat of arms of Mexico and the official name of the country (, &quot;United Mexican States&quot;) above it. It is the standard design for infantry units and other general services. The same design is used as the National Standard of all Mexican Army cavalry and artillery units as well as artillery units of the Mexican Naval Infantry (under the Navy). Colours and standards are both gold fringed, and the lettering is also in gold.

As a uniformed federal force, the National Guard&#x27;s units are entitled to a National Colour or Standard.

Mexican Navy units and the Heroic Military Academy are the only ones entitled to regimental colours. Navy schools carry a white gold fringed colour with the heraldic emblem of the school.

==== Nicaragua ====
Nicaragua&#x27;s military colours under the Nicaraguan Armed Forces are heavily following US practice, as the Nicaraguan flag is treated as a National Colour. The unit colours are in red, with a gold outline of Nicaragua with the service, unit or branch insignia in the centre.

====United States====
In the United States military, each branch has its own flag, an organizational colour, sometimes also called a ceremonial flag. Each of these is × , some using gold fringe during specific instances. The ceremonial flag is paraded with a National Color of equal dimensions in a colour guard, with gold fringe as necessary. The National Color is never dipped in salute, but remains vertical at all times, while the organizational colours and any guidons are dipped as necessary. When the National Color is not cased, all persons salute the Colors. The finial is a nickel or chrome-plated spearhead, though the Navy uses different finials on occasion.

Each service attaches campaign/battle streamers, sometimes known as battle honours, for actions in which the service as a whole has taken part. These can either be war service streamers, which are in the colours of the appropriate campaign medal and have the name of the campaign embroidered; or unit citation streamers, which have the name of the action embroidered and signify that the unit&#x27;s performance in a specific action has been worthy of special mention. Units are also permitted to wear streamers of overseas awards they may have been presented with. These streamers are in the colours of the appropriate medal ribbon. The streamers are × . The Army, for instance, currently has 178 service streamers, embroidering the name of each battle on each, as does the Air Force. The Marine Corps and Navy instead embroider award devices onto streamers to consolidate them, having 62 and 34, respectively.

===== United States Air Force =====
U.S. Air Force (USAF) groups and above have the same National Color as the Army; the Organizational Color is ultramarine blue, with the group&#x27;s coat of arms beneath the USAF crest, which is an eagle on a cloud background. The fringe is in gold. Wing and force colours have their heraldic emblem used instead of the eagle.

This is the same design for Air Force commands and educational institutions but with the eagle replaced by the emblem of the formation.

===== United States Army =====


In the Army, most regiments, battalions of regiments, and separate battalions also have a stand of colours. The first is the National Color, which is a version of the national flag trimmed with a gold fringe, and is the equivalent of the King&#x27;s Colour in the British Army. The second is the Organizational Color, which is the equivalent of the regimental colour; this is the same dimensions as the National Color, but is of a single colour representing the branch of the service that the unit is from; each branch also has its own fringe colour, which the Organizational Color is trimmed with. In the centre of the colour, for regiments is the eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, but with the regimental coat of arms in the shield. The eagle has in its beak a scroll bearing the regimental motto, with the crest of the regiment&#x27;s coat of arms above it and the regiment&#x27;s name below. Attached to the Organizational Color are the campaign and unit citation streamers awarded to the individual unit – these are equivalent to the battle honours embroidered directly onto the colours of British and Commonwealth units. The Organizational Color was carried in lieu of a National Color until shortly before the American Civil War, when the Stars and Stripes became the National Color. Civil War era units sometimes carried alternative Organizational Colors based on their home state flags or of other designs.

Brigade, division and corps colours, also gold fringed, are in the facing colour of the service branch, for brigades the colour is of a bicolour design. These colours have the command heraldic arms at the centre.

===== United States Marine Corps =====

In the Marine Corps, each battalion-sized unit or larger maintains a set of colours. The organizational colour is identical to the Marine Corps battle colour, except that the scroll has the unit&#x27;s name instead of &quot;United States Marine Corps&quot;. It also bears the streamers authorized to the unit, or scarlet and gold tassels if none are authorized.

Fringe is never used on the national colors when carried by Marine Corps unit. Instead, a red, white, and blue tassel can be used to decorate.

===== United States Navy =====
Prior to Executive Order 10812 of 24 April 1959, the United States Navy used the U.S. Naval Infantry Battalion Flag as its unofficial colours. While the Navy uses a number of maritime flags, such as the Ensign and Jack of the United States, the Flag of the United States Navy is normally seen only at ceremonies and parades. The display of streamers and fringe is consistent with that of the Marine Corps.

===== United States Naval Construction Force =====
When Naval Construction Battalions (Seabees) were first formed in 1942 the Naval Infantry Battalion Flag was mandated by Naval Regulation as the colours of the Naval Construction Force. Each battalion-sized unit or larger maintains a set of colours. The organizational colours of each unit is identical, excepting that each will have the unit&#x27;s name and number in white on the flag. The display of streamers authorized to the unit is consistent with that of the Marine Corps.

===== Other shore establishment units and commands of the Navy =====
Organizational colours of the US Navy&#x27;s other shore establishment commands and units and all command formations are in navy blue with the arms of the unit or command, with appropriate displayed streamers attached if authorized.

===South America ===
====Argentina====
Each unit of the Argentine Armed Forces, the Argentine National Gendarmerie, the Argentine Federal Police and the Argentine Naval Prefecture bears the national colours on flags, called the National War Flags, which are the national flag with the unit&#x27;s name embroidered on it in gold lettering. The colours are carried by the unit&#x27;s most junior officer, escorted by two armed NCOs, except in academies and schools, where it is carried by the top-ranked student of the senior course, and escorted by his or her second- and third-ranked classmates. If a decoration has been awarded to the unit, it is attached to the national colours&#x27; cravat. The national colours are never dipped in salute, except to salute another national colours which pass by or are being the subject of a special honour. Besides the national colours, each unit has its unique regimental colours, normally in the arm or service&#x27;s colour background, with the unit&#x27;s coat of arms on it. However not all units have such a common background. For example the Regiment of Patricians has the Cross of Burgundy as its official regimental colours because of its lineage dating back from 1806. Units which were made part of the Army of the Andes during Argentina&#x27;s independence war also carry the Flag of the Army of the Andes as a 3rd Colour.

====Brazil====
Units of the Brazilian Armed Forces carry a stand of two Colours, differing per service.

The standard of the Brazilian Army measures 80 × 120 cm, white with the Army coat of arms in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight&#x27;s helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a nickel-plated lance-head finial, 32 cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a cravat () divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212 cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5 cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10 cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Brazilian Navy&#x27;s flag uses dark blue colours; the Brazilian Air Force flag uses ultramarine blue.

Brazilian military units also carry the national flag as a National Colour. This is in the dimensions 90 × 128 cm. It is mounted on the same size staff and with the same finial as the Army standard, but the cravat is divided lengthwise yellow and green, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Cruzeiro do Sul in white stars, yellow, and green. The staff is covered in green velvet with a yellow spiral strip. The colour belt is 10 cm in width, covered with green velvet with yellow velvet stripes of width and number varying with the rank of the organization&#x27;s commander.

Unit colours differ per service branch and speciality.

====Chile====
Units of the Chilean Army carry one main colour, known as the (combat standard). This is the same as the national flag, but with an embroidered star and with the unit designation, honorific title, founding date and place, and, depending on the unit, other historic information and honours embroidered diagonally across the fly in gold. The flag is also trimmed with gold fringe. It is mounted on a staff with a gilt condor finial; below the finial is a cravat in the national colours with decorations attached. In addition to the military colour, particularly distinguished units, and long serving units may carry a second Colour known as a (colonel&#x27;s colour). This is a red field with a large white five-pointed star. In the angles of the star are the names and dates of battle honours surrounded by laurel wreaths, all in gold, while in an arc above the star is the designation of the unit, also in gold. The flag is also surrounded by gold fringe. Since 2017, the 16th Infantry Regiment Talca became the first to sport a blue coloured in honour of its origins as a city guard battalion formed during the War of the Pacific.

The Chilean Air Force, the Chilean Navy, the Carabineros de Chile and the Chilean Gendarmerie all use the as their main colour, and do not use the at all. The design is the same as in the Army&#x27;s.

====Colombia====
The main state colours of the Military Forces of Colombia and the National Police of Colombia is the Flag of Colombia with the Coat of arms of Colombia in the centre inside a circle with a red border, used by all the services. These flags also carry medals and decorations attached to the flag. The MFC and the NPC also uses unit battle colours (brigade-level, regiment-level and battalion-level), that differ accordingly per service. All of them are gold fringed. Uniquely for Colombia, the battle colour tradition is mainly US-influenced. In addition, the service colour is used as a secondary color, also gold fringed, to denote service affiliation.

The Navy, given the British influence, uses the national flag as a State Colour for ships and commands, and few naval units have a full strand of colours.

====Uruguay====
Aside from the three state colours (the Flag of Uruguay, the Artigas flag and the Flag of the Treinta y Tres), the Uruguayan military also has regimental colours that differ per service and unit. The national colours have armed colour guards while the regimental colour has none at all. All are gold fringed.

====Venezuela====
In the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela, aside from the Flag of Venezuela as the National Colour, there are also Organizational Colours for each of the 6 service branches and the Ministerial Colour of the Ministry of Defence and Unit Colours, which differ per service branch and arm. Every military unit from the Ministry of defence down to all individual units have a stand of colours like in the United Kingdom, but differ from the battalion to the service and the national level. The national flag, until the 1940s, served also as the unit state colour in the same manner as the National Colour of the United States Army and the State/Sovereign&#x27;s Colour in the Commonwealth of Nations, and was based on the national flag but with the unit inscription replacing the stars in the centre in white lettering. The Venezuelan National Militia is the only service branch that uses a battle colour, similar to the flag of the Cuban July 26 Movement: the colour is red and black with the service name on it in white, and a separate colour is used for the service headquarters at the Montana Barracks in Caracas. Starting from July 2013 onward it was granted permission to use a 4th colour for its battalions: red with the eyes of the late President Hugo Chávez and the inscription (Chavez Lives On) below, topped with a scarlet star.

Since 2014 the National Armed Forces uses two additional colours (the National Militia its 5th and 6th): that of the Supreme Commander&#x27;s Colour, which is red bearing the portrait of the late President Chávez surrounded by a wreath and the Armed Forces Motto (&quot;Independence and Socialist Fatherland, we will live on and triumph!&quot;) below and the inscription &quot;Supreme Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution&quot; () and the eight golden stars from the National Flag above it, plus the Memorial Colour of the Liberator and Father of the Nation (introduced in the summer of 2016), which is of the same colour facing but with the wreath containing the portrait of Simon Bolivar, the eight gold stars and his title above and the words &quot;Freedom, Sovereignty, Independence&quot; () below the title, all in gold.

The colours used on the Unit Colours are as follows:

* Red: Ministry of Defence (formerly grey), Service units, Marine Corps, National Militia, Military Technical Academy, Presidential Honour Guard Brigade, Caracas HQ Battalion of the Ministry of Defence
* Dark blue and red: Venezuelan Army HQ and units directing to Army HQ, Division and Brigade Colours
* Yellow: Infantry, Jungle Infantry, Airborne Units
* Orange: Rangers
* Green: Army Engineers
* Dark blue: Venezuelan Army Special Forces
* Red and Black: Rapid Action (Infantry) Battalions
* Black: Armor
* Burgundy red: Artillery and Air Defence Artillery
* Grey: Logistics, National Armed Forces Communications and Electronics College
* Navy blue: Navy
* Ultramarine blue: Air Force (formerly light green)
* Maroon: National Guard
* Dark blue and white: Bolivarian Military University of Venezuela, Military Academy of the Bolivarian Army and Armed Forces Health Sciences Academy
* Light blue and white: Venezuelan Naval Academy
* White: Venezuelan Army military high schools

==Guidons and standards==
===Commonwealth of Nations===
The standard is the colours-equivalent for the heavy cavalry (e.g., horse guards and dragoon guards). At , on an pole, it is much smaller than infantry colours, so that it can be carried by a soldier on horseback. The guidon is the equivalent for the light cavalry (e.g., dragoons, light dragoons, hussars and lancers). It is swallow-tailed, , with an -long pole.

The word &quot;guidon&quot; is a corruption of the French &quot;guyde homme&quot; – &#x27;the guide man&#x27;. Originally each troop had its own, but this was quickly reduced to a single, regimental one. With the increased dispersion of troops required in the light cavalry role, their operational function had ceased by the 1830s and they were discontinued. The regiment&#x27;s kettledrums, with the battle honours woven onto the drum banners (with the exception of 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars and its successors, where they are uncovered, with the battle honours engraved onto the kettledrums themselves) became the focal point of the regiment&#x27;s loyalty. In 1952 King George VI reintroduced the guidons of the light cavalry for ceremonial purposes.

Both the standard and the guidon are usually of crimson trimmed in gold fringe and with the regiment&#x27;s insignia in the centre. The regiment&#x27;s battle honours are emblazoned on both the obverse and reverse, up to a maximum of 22 on each side.

===Denmark===
Cavalry (armour) units carry a standard (), of similar design to the infantry colour, but smaller and square, with the cross centred on the field. The royal cypher is in the upper hoist and the initials of the regiment in the lower hoist. The Guard Hussar Regiment&#x27;s standard is unique, as it has two monograms – with King Frederick VI&#x27;s monogram in top right corner.

===France===
In the French Army, mounted units carry (standards). Mounted units include armoured corps and cavalry, artillery, transportation, army aviation, and supplies. The is a 64 × 64 cm square flag similar to the carried by the units of foot, with the same design: the regimental name at the obverse and the battle honours at the reserve.

===Italy===
In the Italian Army, cavalry units carry a (standard) of the same pattern as the , but which measures 60 cm × 60 cm.

===Netherlands===
The two hussar regiments of the Royal Netherlands Army carry a (standard), of similar design to the infantry colour, but smaller (50 cm × 50 cm).

===Portugal===
Until the 1960s, the Portuguese Military followed the traditions of its foot units having colours (, literally &quot;flags&quot;), while mounted units had standards (), the latter being smaller versions of the colours. Standards were also carried by naval and aviation units. In the 1960s, the traditional separation between colours and standards was abolished, with all being reclassified as &quot;national standards&quot; (). At the same time, a new type of standard, the heraldic standard, was introduced. Presently, the military units, commands, forces and establishments have both a national standard and an heraldic standard. While the design of the national standards reflects the National Flag, the designs of the heraldic standards reflect the individual heraldic symbology of each of the units.

In the Portuguese military parlance, a guidon () is a small square flag of a battalion sized unit. Guidons of a very simple design were introduced in the 19th century, as the tactical field signs of the foot units that didn&#x27;t carry colours, namely the second battalions of the infantry regiments and the independent (light infantry) battalions. In the early 20th century, the tactical role of the guidons was discontinued. The guidons assumed then a ceremonial role, coming to have a more elaborate design which incorporated the symbology of their respective units. Guidelines for the design of guidons accordingly with heraldic rules were introduced in the 1950s, these becoming mandatory and standardized in the 1960s. The present guidon design - similar in all branches of the Military - consists in the quadrature of the coat of arms of the corresponding unit or of its parent unit, framed by a bordure. The colours of the bordure can be used to identify a sub-unit inside its parent unit.

Besides heraldic standards and guidons, the Portuguese military units also use heraldic pennants (). These are small swallow-tailed or triangular flags used to identify company sized units.

Some of the Portuguese uniformed security forces and civil emergency organizations also make use of heraldic standards, guidons and pennants, usually modelled after the military ones.

===United States===
In the United States armed forces, guidons are much more prevalent, with units below battalion size being authorized to use them. In the US Army, these are swallow tailed flags that are 20 in × 27 in, and are in the colour of the branch of the service the unit is from, with the branch&#x27;s insignia the most prominent device. Also on the guidon is included the unit&#x27;s identifying letter, and the number(s) of its parent unit. War service and campaign streamers are not attached to these guidons, but unit citation streamers can be.

==Guns==
In regiments of the (British) Royal Artillery, and artillery regiments of other Commonwealth countries, the guns are afforded the status of colours. This is due to the difficulty of artillery regiments being able to carry flags onto the battlefield, and the fact that the guns themselves were the rallying points for the soldiers manning them. As a consequence, whenever artillery regiments parade, the etiquette that would normally be applied to the colours is applied to the guns. During the Battle of Balaclava gunners abandoned their guns, in effect abandoning their colours, causing disgrace.

Because the guns have the status of colours, gunners of commonwealth countries will attempt to prevent their guns falling intact into enemy hands both for practical reasons (so that the guns can not be turned and used against their own side) and for the honour of the regiment. For example, the last action of gunners of the Royal Artillery during the fall of Singapore was to destroy their guns.

The Honourable Artillery Company, the oldest regiment in the British Army, and not part of the Royal Artillery, is the only artillery regiment to have both colours and guns, which are treated with equal respect.

In Singapore, however, since its independence the Singapore Army&#x27;s artillery arm (the Singapore Artillery) uses colours instead of guns; this is also the case for the Malaysian Army, Pakistan Army, Royal Cambodian Army and the Royal Thai Army, whose artillery units use colours and not guns on parade. This has been the same case for the Indian Regiment of Artillery, which presents colours in dismounted parades, and the Sri Lanka Artillery, which has a strand of colours similar to the HAC.

==Etiquette==

In some countries, the following etiquette is followed:

*The Regimental Colour (or Standard or Guidon) is always paraded whenever the regiment is on a formal parade. However, the Sovereign&#x27;s (King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s)/Presidential Colour is only paraded on certain occasions.
*Compliments (for example saluting and presenting arms) are always paid to the (uncased) Colours.
*When the Colours are being paraded, they are carried either by a subaltern or warrant officer, dependent on the regiment. On parade, the Colours always have an armed escort, the Colour Party, who would normally be non-commissioned officers. In the infantry this role usually falls to Colour Sergeants.
*When the Colours are not being paraded, most regiments house them in their Officers&#x27; Mess. They are &quot;cased&quot; and secured every night.
*When a regiment is presented with new Colours, the old Colours, which will now never again be paraded, are laid up (i.e.: put on permanent display) in a place sacred to the Regiment (for example the Regimental Chapel).

==Ceremonies of colours==
===Royal Navy===
The British Royal Navy and other navies of the Commonwealth of Nations call the flag-raising ceremony that happens every morning when a ship is in harbour &quot;colours&quot;. In British home waters, colours is conducted at 0800 (eight bells in the morning watch) from 15 February to 31 October inclusive, and at 0900 (two bells in the forenoon watch) during the winter.

When sunset is at or before 2100, flags are lowered at sunset at the ceremony of &quot;sunset&quot;. When sunset is after 2100, the evening flag lowering ceremony is called &quot;evening colours&quot; and carried out at 2100.

===United States Navy===
The United States Navy performs the same ceremonies, called &quot;Morning Colors&quot; and &quot;Evening Colors&quot;, at 0800 and sunset each day. When &quot;Colors&quot; is played aboard Navy and Marine Corps bases, those outdoors must stop to render proper courtesies by saluting if in uniform or, if out of uniform, by standing at attention, until &quot;Carry On&quot; is sounded. Marines and sailors driving on base during this time are expected to stop their vehicles and stand at attention until the ceremony is over.

===Yacht clubs===
Many traditional yacht clubs worldwide also conduct morning and evening colour ceremonies. At 0800 each morning and at sunset during the club&#x27;s active sailing season the ceremony is performed by the launchmen or harbourmaster.
* First, a bell is sounded as an alert for all members and guests present to stand at attention.
* A cannon is then fired and the national ensign hoisted (or lowered if sunset).
* At the conclusion of the ceremony the most senior officer present says: &quot;As you were&quot; and members and guests may carry on.

==In games==
Capturing an enemy&#x27;s flag was formerly a major goal in war, and it is still practised today, and so capturing the enemy flag also appears in several games:

*Capture the flag
*&quot;Stratego&quot;, a board game where the goal is to capture the enemy&#x27;s flag
*Chess: In Estonian the queen is known as (&quot;standard&quot;), while in Italian the bishop is called (&quot;standard-bearer&quot;)

<text>The York Knights are the men&#x27;s professional rugby league team of York RLFC, based in York, England. The club play their home games at York Community Stadium and currently compete in the Championship, the second tier of British rugby league.

The club, which was founded as the York City Knights, is a phoenix club established after the original York club folded in 2002. The Knights played in blue and white until 2017 when they reverted to the city&#x27;s traditional home colours of amber and black. The club was renamed as York RLFC in 2022 with the men&#x27;s team continuing to be known as the Knights and the women&#x27;s team becoming the Valkyrie.

==History==
===1868–2002: Predecessor===

The first club was formed in 1868 as &quot;York Football Club&quot;, playing both codes, association and rugby football in different fields as the club did not have their own venue.

When Northern rugby teams broke away from the Rugby Football Union to form their own Northern Union in 1895, York initially stayed with the RFU but in 1901 they joined the new entity.

The original York Wasps folded in March 2002. After a last-ditch take-over deal to save the Wasps collapsed, the RFL accepted the club&#x27;s resignation on 26 March 2002.

=== 2002–2003: New club ===
A supporters&#x27; trust working party was formed on 27 March and applied to the RFL to continue the 2002 Northern Ford Premiership fixtures. After hearing it would be impossible to meet requirements to return that season, on 5 May fans backed a proposal for a new club to apply for admittance to the league for 2003.

The RFL accepted York&#x27;s bid to play in the newly formed National League Two on condition that they had £75,000 in the bank by 31 August. The new club decided that the best way to raise cash was through a fans&#x27; membership scheme. Former Great Britain star Paul Broadbent was revealed as player-coach. With the total standing at £70,000, John Smith&#x27;s brewery came in with £5,000 as the club hit the target just hours before the deadline.

The full name of the new club was revealed to be &quot;York City Knights RLFC&quot;, following a competition in The Evening Press. Club bosses, in the following month of October, also let the public design a club logo which was based on the New South Wales Rugby League Team&#x27;s logo, while they picked new colours of blue and white – a move away from York RL&#x27;s traditional amber and black. John Guildford, majority shareholder of York building firm Guildford Construction, was revealed to be the majority shareholder. They played at Huntington Stadium, where the previous incarnation of York RL played.

===2003–2006: National League 2 and promotion===
The Knights played their first game at home against Hull Kingston Rovers in the National League Cup on 19 January with a bumper crowd of 3,105. In their first year, the Knights finished fourth with 11 wins, a draw and 6 losses. They made the National League Two play-offs but lost 50–30 to Barrow Raiders. Paul Broadbent resigned as coach at the end of the season.

Richard Agar was appointed head coach for the following year. They made it all the way to the Challenge Cup Quarter-final, losing 50–12 to Huddersfield Giants. York also made the semi-finals of the Championship Cup, losing 32–0 to Hull Kingston Rovers. After finishing second in the league, and three points behind Barrow, the Knights entered the playoffs. They lost 37–20 in the qualifying semi final to Halifax and then beat Workington Town 70–10. Mark Cain broke the record for most tries in a match and the score was the highest points tally since the Knights were born. They were narrowly beaten in the play-off final by Halifax 34–30 at the Halton Stadium in Widnes. Agar left York to join Hull F.C. as an assistant coach.

York appointed Mick Cook as their new head coach in 2005 as part of a partnership with Super League club Leeds Rhinos. Cook&#x27;s side made it to the 5th round of the Challenge Cup losing 62–0 to St. Helens 62–0 at Knowsley Road. At the end of the league season they were champions by three points and were promoted automatically to National League One for the first time. They were now only one tier away from Super League. They had the highest crowd average for National League One teams, of 1,986. York&#x27;s game against Hunslet on 25 May 2005 drew a crowd of 3,224 which at the time was a record for National League One.

York kicked off their first season in rugby league&#x27;s second tier, losing 25–18 away at Widnes Vikings. They lost their first seven games before finally beating Oldham 62–0 and then again 15 days later, 54–10. Despite a good late run of form including wins over Whitehaven, Doncaster and Rochdale Hornets, York were relegated back to National League Two at the end of the season culminating in a 60–16 defeat to Leigh Centurions at Hilton Park. York finished second bottom, above Oldham with five wins and thirteen defeats, three points below Doncaster. They did however, win the Fairfax Cup, after beating Batley 14–10 in their first appearance in the York International 9s.

===2007–2010: Relegation to Championship 1===

2007 was a poor season for the City Knights, finishing sixth in the league with ten wins and twelve losses. There was also a record defeat for York City Knights in the Challenge Cup 5th round losing 74–4 to Huddersfield Giants, Chris Spurr getting York&#x27;s sole try. Mick Cook quit as coach at the end of the season to run his business and Paul March was appointed player-coach on a one-year rolling contract in September 2007.

He took York to sixth place again with eleven wins and ten losses. Even though there were three promotion places available (two automatic, one via the playoffs), the Knights failed to capitalise and lost in the playoffs to Rochdale Hornets 12–28. Gateshead Thunder and Barrow Raiders went up automatically, Doncaster went up via the playoffs.

2009 saw the Knights start positively and looked like they could challenge for the title. After a Sky Sports game at home to Oldham, March was sacked in due to disciplinary matters and then director of rugby James Ratcliffe took over. The Knights finished third but eventually lost in the playoffs in the semi-final to Oldham 44–14.

Chris Thorman arrived at the club in 2010 as assistant to Ratcliffe but saw himself become acting head coach while Ratcliffe was suspended. The Knights claimed one of their biggest scalps when they defeated Leigh Centurions, who were in the division above, 13–12 in the Northern Rail Cup group stages thanks to a late Thorman drop goal. Ratcliffe returned for the away game at Doncaster and Dave Woods arrived at York as director of rugby in April 2010. Five games later, Ratcliffe was sacked after a 30–36 defeat to Swinton Lions and Woods was named as head coach. York were fifth in Championship 1 at the time after seven wins and six losses in the league. Woods&#x27; first game was a 60–12 victory over Gateshead and finished third in the table and thus qualified for the play-offs. After losing to Oldham, York then beat Blackpool Panthers in the semi-final where they&#x27;d face Oldham in the final. On 26 September 2010, the Knights won the Co-operative Championship 1 play-off Grand Final to earn promotion to the Championship. They beat Oldham 25–6 at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington. The Knights had finished the regular season 13 points behind their final opponents.

===2011–2013: Promotion to the Championship===

York finished third-bottom of the Championship in 2011, but bottom club Toulouse were exempt from relegation so, with two going down, the Knights faced demotion along with Dewsbury Rams – until the RFL decided not to admit Crusaders into this division following their withdrawal from Super League, thus earning York a reprieve. Dewsbury were also saved after Barrow Raiders received a points deduction meaning the Knights finished fourth bottom. Just six days later Dave Woods was sacked by the club.

In 2012, there were no relegation spots available and thus, York decided against strengthening their squad. Chris Thorman was appointed head coach and former Leeds Rhinos full back Jordan Tansey signed for the club on a one-year deal. York won one league game all season beating Swinton Lions 26–22. Thus York finished bottom of the pile. Chris Thorman announced he would be joining the coaching staff at Huddersfield Giants at the end of the season. He was to be replaced by Gary Thornton who was appointed head coach in 2012 .

2013 started off well for the City Knights and looked to be challenging for the playoffs. A run of eleven straight losses at the end of the season and failure to win away in the league since June 2011 saw them relegated back to Rugby Leagues basement tier. They made the 5th round of the Challenge Cup losing 92–8 away at Catalans Dragons. The Knights finished the season seven points from safety with six wins and twenty losses.

===2014–2016: League 1===

York City Knights played in Championship 1, as they finished bottom of the Championship in the 2013 season. Famous wins in 2014 came against Hunslet whom they beat three time, 28–26 away in March, 40–0 at home in May and won the league at the South Leeds Stadium after the comeback was sealed thanks to a Colton Roche Try meaning the Knights won 20–18. They also beat Oldham 54–14 at home. York City Knights topped Championship 1 but lost in the end of season play-offs to Hunslet Hawks, thus failing to secure promotion back the Championship.

Gary Thornton was sacked and was replaced by James Ford for the start of the 2015 season where the Knights are now homeless after John Guildford failed to sign up for the Community Stadium deal. John Guildford has stepped down as Chairman and appointed four directors; Stephen Knowles, Dave Baldwin, Neil Jennings and Gary Dickenson, the latter has since stepped down.

On 18 June 2015, York City Knights reserves were kicked out of the reserve league and banned from entering the 2016 competition. The first team still remained homeless.

At the end of the 2015 season, York City Knights finished Fourth in League 1 and qualified for the playoffs. They lost out to Swinton Lions 17–16 on the Golden Point They were also knocked out in the League 1 Cup second round by Newcastle Thunder. They reached the fifth round of the Challenge Cup, losing to St. Helens 46–6.

===Closure threat===

In July 2016 it was announced the club would not be able to play their first game of the Super 8s against Doncaster at Bootham Crescent due to York City FC playing on the Saturday, meaning that the Knights would have to play midweek due to there having to be 24 hours between games at the stadium. Due to the disputes between the owner and the council, the club directors announced that they would be winding up the club as soon as all necessary legal steps had been taken. The following day a joint statement from the club, the RFL and the city council was issued stating &quot;We continue to work to resolve this situation and are hopeful that ways can be found for James Ford and his players to be able to fulfil the remainder of their fixtures this season.&quot;
On 25 July the club owner, John Guildford, announced that he was in negotiation with local businessman, Gary Dickenson, and that the sale would be of a club &quot;virtually debt-free&quot; enabling the Knights to continue to run. however on 23 August Dickenson discontinued the negotiations. Following the collapse of the sale to Dickenson, Guildford put the club up for sale to any interested buyer.

The RFL issued a deadline of 1 December 2016 for ownership issues to be resolved and late on 1 December the club issued a statement that ownership of the Knights had passed entirely to a consortium headed by Jon Flatman. The following day the RFL confirmed that the team would be re-instated into League 1 for the 2017 season. In January 2017, it was revealed that the club will play all home fixtures in 2017 and 2018 at York City&#x27;s Bootham Crescent, and that the team colours had changed to amber and black.

In April 2018, the club broke two 24 year old world records for rugby league when they beat West Wales Raiders 144–0, beating the previous highest score of 142–4 (Huddersfield Giants v Blackpool Gladiators, November 1994) and the previous record margin of 138 points (Barrow Raiders v Nottingham City, 138–0, also November 1994).
At the end of the 2018 season, York were promoted back to the RFL Championship.

===Back in the Championship===
York finished the 2021 RFL Championship season in 9th place. The following year, the club reached the playoffs by finishing sixth. However, a month before the playoffs began on the 21 August 2022, York suffered a club record 100–4 loss against Leigh. In the playoffs, York upset Halifax in the first week to set up another match against Leigh. On this occasion, York were defeated 70–10 which ended their season.

==Stadiums==
===2002–2014: Huntington Stadium===

The Knights played their first game at Huntington Stadium on 19 January 2003. It had previously been the home ground of York Wasps until they were dissolved in 2002. The capacity was 3,428 and the stadium also had an athletics track. The Knights left the stadium at the end of the 2014 season and it was later demolished to allow for the building of York Community Stadium which is on the same site.

===2015: Elmpark Way===
The Knights were left homeless and were forced to ground share with local amateur team Heworth A.R.L.F.C. for a season until they could find a permanent home.

===2016–2020: Bootham Crescent===

In 2016 the Knights began ground sharing with York City F.C. at Bootham Crescent. The Crescent had a capacity of 8,256 with 3,409 seats and the remaining capacity was standing.

===2021: York Community Stadium===

In March 2021 the knights played their first match at York Community Stadium in a pre-season game against Hull F.C. The stadium has a capacity of 8,500.

==Club identity and colours==

In 2002, following the demise of York Wasps, the newly established York club sought a new beginning with a new identity that left behind the difficulties associated with the previous club. The team adopted a blue and white kit rather than the traditional amber and black colours and competitions were held in the local newspaper, &quot;The Evening Press&quot;, first to choose a new name, York City Knights RLFC, and then to design a club logo. A club mascot, Norris the Knight, was introduced making his first public appearance in December 2003 and taking part in the Mascot Grand National in 2006.

In the 2016 season, with the Knights sharing a ground with York City F.C., they launched an away kit in blue and red; the colours of the football club and proposed colour scheme of the future community stadium. However, the club changed ownership in December 2016 and the following month it was announced that both the home and away kits would change to the amber and black historically associated with rugby league in York, and which had previously been used for heritage and away kits. The club badge initially remained blue and white, but this too would change colour the following year when the 2018 kit launched featuring a new logo that commemorated the 150th anniversary of the original York club.

On 14 October 2022, the club announced that it had changed its name to York RLFC as an umbrella term with the men&#x27;s team continued to be known as the Knights. The women&#x27;s team became the Valkyrie. Both teams introduced new logos as part of the rebrand.

<text>Harvey Teasdale (1817–1904) was a Victorian performer best known for his success as the &#x27;man-monkey&#x27; stage character.

Teasdale was born in Sheffield to a family of cutlers. He performed several times as the clown in pantomimes and harlequinades before cultivating a reputation for playing the &#x27;man-monkey&#x27;. Teasdale toured the United Kingdom with this act with much success. His most famous stunt was his attempt to sail down the River Don, Sheffield, in a barrel pulled by ducks. As well as performing, Teasdale managed several theatres.

In 1862, Teasdale&#x27;s wife, Sarah, separated from him, taking their two daughters with her. Teasdale discovered Sarah&#x27;s whereabouts and attacked her with an empty pistol before a neighbour intervened. He was convicted of attempted murder and served two years in Wakefield Prison (1862-1864).

Teasdale came out of prison a &#x27;converted clown&#x27;, having become a devout Christian. He gave up the theatre and joined the Hallelujah Band in Sheffield. In 1878 he published his autobiography, &quot;The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison&quot;, and by 1881 he purported to have sold over 40,000 copies.

During his later life Teasdale preached Methodism in and around Sheffield. He was reunited with Sarah and lived with her until she died in 1883. He remarried in 1886.

Teasdale died in 1904 in Firvale Workhouse Asylum and is buried in the General Cemetery, Sheffield.

==Early life==
Teasdale was born in Sheffield Park, and during his childhood he moved around Sheffield with his family. He attended several different schools, but he &#x27;seldom went&#x27; unless accompanied by his sister, preferring to play truant. He began his education at the Carver Street National School, but instead of attending classes preferred to make trips to the Wicker Bridge and swim in the water fully dressed to amuse the blacksmiths. He then moved to Netherthorpe Academy where, when he attended school, he showed early signs of having a theatrical personality: &#x27;I used to amuse the scholars by leaping through hoops and over chairs like a monkey&#x27;. He was later sent to Fox&#x27;s School, where his mischievous reign continued. He alludes to being very popular in the school after playing numerous pranks on his school master, such as knocking a needle through his chair. Once more he was taken out of school, this time being relocated to a boarding school in the nearby town of Dronfield. Teasdale was a sprightly child who was &#x27;very fond of running up spouts and getting on to roofs of buildings and running on the slates like a cat&#x27;. As a result, he was often involved in accidents and scrapes. Furthermore, he got into frequent fights with other boys in the town: &#x27;I do not think at that time there was a lad in Sheffield... could stand any chance with me at fighting&#x27;.

After another failed attempt at settling his son in to a school, Teasdale&#x27;s father, Benjamin, decided to keep him at home to with the intention of training him for the cutlery trade. However, on several occasions he claims to have shirked his errands. His family moved from Sheffield to Walkley Hall and it was here that Teasdale declared &#x27;it was prophesied by one of the Walkley Belles that Harvey would become an actor!’ He began attending plays at Sheffield&#x27;s Theatre Royal and his interest in acting was ignited. However, he still made time for mischief, like stealing fish at Crookes Moor Dam: &#x27;The fish that I had caught were in my hat on my head. When asked what I had done with the fish I said that I had caught none. The fish… at that moment jumped on my head and appeared to my guilty conscience to say &quot;Harvey, what a liar you are&quot;’.’
In 1832 the Cholera epidemic swept Sheffield and Teasdale was one of its victims. He claimed he was very ill, but nevertheless managed to survive. Soon after his recovery Teasdale and a friend named Charles Black decided they wanted to leave Sheffield and head to London, but with no transport they had barely reached Chesterfield before they chose to give up.

Performing Life

Harvey began performing in Sheffield public houses and theatres in the early 1830s. He moved around the city taking rooms at different pubs, often playing the clown in performances. He alludes continuously to the vice and danger associated with the life of an actor: &#x27;I shall not record the wicked scenes that were enacted in this room. I shall not lift the curtain&#x27;.

Teasdale&#x27;s most famous stunt was his attempt to sail down the River Don in a barrel drawn by ducks. He advertised his performance on flaming placards throughout Sheffield and on the day approximately 70,000 people lined the streets to watch. As he sailed along the force of the crowd became so great part of the wall collapsed sending many spectators in to the water. Teasdale maintained that the cries of the people who had fallen &#x27;might have appalled a stouter heart than mine&#x27;. Nobody was hurt, but many people &#x27;cursed old Harvey and his ducks&#x27;. His attempt was a failure. The &quot;Sheffield Iris&quot; described the stunt as foolish novelty: &#x27;The clown (Teasdale) made a start with his tub and ducks... but they were completely unmanageable, and he rolled and rocked about with his short paddles until he got a good dousing&#x27;.

Teasdale first played the &#x27;man-monkey&#x27;, his signature act, at Grantham Theatre in the mid 1840s. He drew in the crowds by jumping from balcony to stage dressed as a monkey. Teasdale was following in a tradition of Skin Performance: actors who impersonated and dressed like animals. His monkey performance was a huge success and it was from here that he began touring the country, meeting with excited audiences. Many local newspapers praised his performance, one referring to him as &#x27;the Yorkshire Phenomenon!’ However, despite his many successes round the country, Teasdale never managed to make a name for himself in London, performing in the capital once to negative reviews: &#x27;Mr Harvey Teasdale was very slow. He has much to learn before he can take his stand as clown in a leading London theatre&#x27;. He allegedly fought with the manager of Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre, London, and left, never to return to perform in the capital again. Yet in his memoir Teasdale speaks highly of his own talent and success: &#x27;It was acknowledged, by undisputed authority, that mine was the best representation of the monkey that had ever appeared on stage&#x27;.

==Attempted murder and trial==
In 1862 Teasdale&#x27;s wife, Sarah, separated from him, taking their two daughters with her. Teasdale struggled to track them down and when he did begged them to return to him. After much chasing, Teasdale finally confronted Sarah, accusing her of earning a living as a prostitute and encouraging their daughters to do the same. He broke into her lodgings and fired a blank at her before attempting to cut her throat and his own. A neighbour intervened and alerted the authorities. Sarah survived the attack and was taken to hospital and Teasdale was arrested and taken to court. Most newspapers documenting the trial mention Teasdale&#x27;s over-dramatic performance on the stand, reporting that there was laughter in the court room when Teasdale said &#x27;I determined to fire it off and cut my throat in the smoke&#x27;. In his own defense he made the following claims: &#x27;Four months ago we were staying at Leeds. I have been married to her 26 years. I loved the ground she walked on and she hated me. While we were in Leeds she left home one Saturday morning. I went in search of her and for the first time I found she was getting her living on the streets, and she boasted that I had not found her out&#x27;. He was sentenced to two years hard labour in Wakefield Prison.

==Conversion and controversy==
Teasdale was interned at Wakefield between 1862 and 1864. He claimed that whilst in prison he underwent a conversion and decided to leave behind his life of vice in the performing industry and preach the doctrines of Methodism. Once released from prison Teasdale moved back to Sheffield and joined the Hallelujah Band to spread the message of Methodism. However, his sincerity is questionable: in an attempt to rid himself of his former persona and the monkey that had become his alter-ego, Teasdale advertised that he would burn his effects, including his monkey costume, in Sheffield&#x27;s Temperance Hall. The &quot;Sheffield Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &#x27;placards have been circulated within the town, stating that Harvey Teasdale, the well-known man monkey and clown, would relate his experiences and destroy his dresses and theatrical effects&#x27;. Yet a different newspaper documents him burning his effects in Leeds and the &quot;Era&quot; suggests they were for sale: &#x27;The whole of Harvey Teasdale&#x27;s pantomimes, monkey pieces, manuscripts... to be sold for £2 10s&#x27;. In spite of his self-proclaimed conversion, there is evidence to suggest that Teasdale&#x27;s former life-style did not allude him.
Teasdale claims he then went to Totley and bought a donkey named Charley, with whom he would travel around the moors searching for work and food. He suggests it was his faith which got him through this lean period. Yet, it is questionable whether he was sincerely struggling or painting himself as a martyr. He was later reunited with Sarah, whom he converted to Methodism.

==Death==
Teasdale died in 1904, aged 86. His obituary doesn&#x27;t give a definite cause of death instead stating that &#x27;for some time his brain had been affected&#x27;. He died in Firvale Workhouse Asylum, where he had been living for a fortnight. He is buried in the General Cemetery, Sheffield.

==Autobiography and legacy==
Teasdale published the first edition of his autobiography in 1878. It went through several editions and by 1881 it had sold over 40,000 copies. Teasdale continued to sell his autobiography, alongside signed photographs of himself. &quot;The Life and Adventures of Harvey Teasdale, the Converted Clown and Man Monkey, with his remarkable conversion in Wakefield Prison&quot; is an unusual example of Victorian life-writing, detailing the extraordinary life of a working class performer who described himself as &#x27;Harvey Teasdale, the converted clown, and once the greatest impersonator of the man monkey in the world, now a sinner saved by grace, fighting the battle of the cross!’ The autobiography has been noted for its highly dramatic tone, heavy use of Shakespearean and biblical quotations and the author&#x27;s questionable sincerity.

Over the past few years a renewed local interest in Teasdale has developed. Efforts are being made towards the reprinting of his memoir within the University of Sheffield. In September 2014, Point Blank Theatre Company premiered their production, &quot;Harvey Teasdale: the Sheffield Man Monkey&quot;, based on Teasdale&#x27;s life as part of Sheffield&#x27;s Festival of the Mind. The production featured Vern Griffiths as Harvey Teadale, Jack Windle as the Chorus and Dr Butler&#x27;s Hatstand Medicine Band as the Hallelujah Band.

<text>In linguistics, vowel length is the perceived length of a vowel sound: the corresponding physical measurement is duration. In some languages vowel length is an important phonemic factor, meaning vowel length can change the meaning of the word, for example in Arabic, Czech, Dravidian languages (such as Tamil), some Finno-Ugric languages (such as Finnish and Estonian), Japanese, Kyrgyz, Samoan, and Xhosa. Some languages in the past likely had the distinction even though their descendants do not, with an example being Latin and its descendent Romance languages.

Whether vowel length alone changes word-meanings in English depends on the particular dialect; it is able to do so in a few non-rhotic dialects, such as Australian English, Lunenburg English, New Zealand English, South African English, and possibly some Southern British English, and in a few rhotic dialects, such as Scottish English and Northern Irish English. It also plays a lesser phonetic role in Cantonese, unlike in other varieties of Chinese, which do not have phonemic vowel length distinctions.

Many languages do not distinguish vowel length phonemically, meaning that vowel length does not change meaning. However, the amount of time a vowel is uttered can change based on factors such as the phonetic characteristics of the sounds around it, for instance whether the vowel is followed by a voiced or a voiceless consonant.

Languages that do distinguish vowel length phonemically usually only distinguish between short vowels and long vowels. Very few languages distinguish three phonemic vowel lengths; some that do so are Estonian, Luiseño, and Mixe. However, languages with two vowel lengths may permit words in which two adjacent vowels are of the same quality: Japanese , , &quot;phoenix&quot;, or Ancient Greek , &quot;inviolable&quot;. Some languages that do not ordinarily have phonemic vowel length but permit vowel hiatus may similarly exhibit sequences of identical vowel phonemes that yield &quot;phonetically&quot; long vowels, such as Georgian , , &quot;you will facilitate it&quot;.

==Related features==
Stress is often reinforced by allophonic vowel length, especially when it is lexical. For example, French long vowels are always in stressed syllables. Finnish, a language with two phonemic lengths, indicates the stress by adding allophonic length, which gives four distinctive lengths and five physical lengths: short and long stressed vowels, short and long unstressed vowels, and a half-long vowel, which is a short vowel found in a syllable immediately preceded by a stressed short vowel: &quot;i-so&quot;.

Among the languages with distinctive vowel length, there are some in which it may occur only in stressed syllables, such as in Alemannic German, Scottish Gaelic and Egyptian Arabic. In languages such as Czech, Finnish, some Irish dialects and Classical Latin, vowel length is distinctive also in unstressed syllables.

In some languages, vowel length is sometimes better analyzed as a sequence of two identical vowels. In Finnic languages, such as Finnish, the simplest example follows from consonant gradation: &quot;haka → haan&quot;. In some cases, it is caused by a following chroneme, which is etymologically a consonant: &quot;jää&quot; &quot;ice&quot; ← Proto-Uralic *&quot;jäŋe&quot;. In non-initial syllables, it is ambiguous if long vowels are vowel clusters; poems written in the Kalevala meter often syllabicate between the vowels, and an (etymologically original) intervocalic &quot;-h-&quot; is seen in that and some modern dialects (&quot;taivaan&quot; vs. &quot;taivahan&quot; &quot;of the sky&quot;). Morphological treatment of diphthongs is essentially similar to long vowels. Some old Finnish long vowels have developed into diphthongs, but successive layers of borrowing have introduced the same long vowels again so the diphthong and the long vowel now again contrast (&quot;nuotti&quot; &quot;musical note&quot; vs. &quot;nootti&quot; &quot;diplomatic note&quot;).

In Japanese, most long vowels are the results of the phonetic change of diphthongs; &quot;au&quot; and &quot;ou&quot; became &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;iu&quot; became &quot;yū&quot;, &quot;eu&quot; became &quot;yō&quot;, and now &quot;ei&quot; is becoming &quot;ē&quot;. The change also occurred after the loss of intervocalic phoneme . For example, modern &quot;Kyōto&quot; (Kyoto) has undergone a shift: . Another example is &quot;shōnen&quot; (&quot;boy&quot;): .

==Phonemic vowel length==
As noted above, only a relatively few of the world&#x27;s languages make a phonemic distinction between long and short vowels. Some families have many such languages, examples being the Dravidian languages and the Finno-Ugric languages. Other languages have fewer relatives with vowel length, including Arabic, Japanese, Scottish Gaelic. There are also older languages such as Ancient Greek, Biblical Hebrew, and Latin which have phonemic vowel length but no descendants that preserve it.

In Latin and Hungarian, some long vowels are analyzed as separate phonemes from short vowels:
Vowel length contrasts with more than two phonemic levels are rare, and several hypothesized cases of three-level vowel length can be analysed without postulating this typologically unusual configuration. Estonian has three distinctive lengths, but the third is suprasegmental, as it has developed from the allophonic variation caused by now-deleted grammatical markers. For example, half-long &#x27;aa&#x27; in &quot;saada&quot; comes from the agglutination *&quot;saa+tta+k */sɑːtˑɑk/&quot; &quot;send (saatta-) +(imperative)&quot;, and the overlong &#x27;aa&#x27; in &quot;saada&quot; comes from *&quot;saa+dak&quot; &quot;get+(infinitive)&quot;. As for languages that have three lengths, independent of vowel quality or syllable structure, these include Dinka, Mixe, Yavapai and Wichita. An example from Mixe is &quot;guava&quot;, &quot;spider&quot;, &quot;knot&quot;. In Dinka the longest vowels are three moras long, and so are best analyzed as overlong e.g. .

Four-way distinctions have been claimed, but these are actually long-short distinctions on adjacent syllables. For example, in Kikamba, there is , , , &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;, &quot;bite&quot;, &quot;we have chosen for everyone and are still choosing&quot;.

===In English===
====Contrastive vowel length====
In many varieties of English, vowels contrast with each other both in length and in quality, and descriptions differ in the relative importance given to these two features. Some descriptions of Received Pronunciation and more widely some descriptions of English phonology group all non-diphthongal vowels into the categories &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot;, convenient terms for grouping the many vowels of English. Daniel Jones proposed that phonetically similar pairs of long and short vowels could be grouped into single phonemes, distinguished by the presence or absence of phonological length (chroneme). The usual long-short pairings for RP are /iː + ɪ/, /ɑː + æ/, /ɜ: + ə/, /ɔː + ɒ/, /u + ʊ/, but Jones omits /ɑː + æ/. This approach is not found in present-day descriptions of English. Vowels show allophonic variation in length and also in other features according to the context in which they occur. The terms &quot;tense&quot; (corresponding to &quot;long&quot;) and &quot;lax&quot; (corresponding to &quot;short&quot;) are alternative terms that do not directly refer to length.

In Australian English, there is contrastive vowel length in closed syllables between long and short and . The following are minimal pairs of length:

====Allophonic vowel length====
In most varieties of English, for instance Received Pronunciation and General American, there is allophonic variation in vowel length depending on the value of the consonant that follows it: vowels are shorter before voiceless consonants and are longer when they come before voiced consonants. Thus, the vowel in &quot;bad&quot; is longer than the vowel in &quot;bat&quot; . Also compare &quot;neat&quot; with &quot;need&quot; . The vowel sound in &quot;beat&quot; is generally pronounced for about 190 milliseconds, but the same vowel in &quot;bead&quot; lasts 350 milliseconds in normal speech, the voiced final consonant influencing vowel length.

Cockney English features short and long varieties of the closing diphthong . The short corresponds to RP in morphologically closed syllables (see thought split), whereas the long corresponds to the non-prevocalic sequence (see l-vocalization). The following are minimal pairs of length:

The difference is lost in running speech, so that &quot;fault&quot; falls together with &quot;fort&quot; and &quot;fought&quot; as or . The contrast between the two diphthongs is phonetic rather than phonemic, as the can be restored in formal speech: etc., which suggests that the underlying form of is (John Wells says that the vowel is equally correctly transcribed with or , not to be confused with ). Furthermore, a vocalized word-final is often restored before a word-initial vowel, so that &quot;fall out&quot; (cf. &quot;thaw out&quot; , with an intrusive) is somewhat more likely to contain the lateral than &quot;fall&quot; . The distinction between and exists only word-internally before consonants other than intervocalic . In the morpheme-final position only occurs (with the vowel being realized as ), so that &quot;all&quot; is always distinct from &quot;or&quot; . Before the intervocalic is the banned diphthong, though here either of the vowels can occur, depending on morphology (compare &quot;falling&quot; with &quot;aweless&quot; ).

In Cockney, the main difference between and , and as well as and is length, not quality, so that &quot;his&quot; , &quot;merry&quot; and &quot;Polly&quot; differ from &quot;here&#x27;s&quot; , &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;poorly&quot; (see cure-force merger) mainly in length. In broad Cockney, the contrast between and is also mainly one of length; compare &quot;hat&quot; with &quot;out&quot; (cf. the near-RP form , with a wide closing diphthong).

====&quot;Long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; vowel letters in spelling and the classroom teaching of reading====

In the teaching of English, vowels are commonly said to have a &quot;short&quot; and a &quot;long&quot; version. The terms &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; are not accurate from a linguistic point of view—at least in the case of Modern English—as the vowels are not actually short and long versions of the same sound; the terminology is a historical holdover due to their arising from proper vowel length in Middle English. The phonetic values of these vowels are shown in the table below.

In some types of phonetic transcription (e.g. pronunciation respelling), &quot;long&quot; vowel letters may be marked with a macron; for example, ⟨ā⟩ may be used to represent the IPA sound . This is sometimes used in dictionaries, most notably in Merriam-Webster (see Pronunciation respelling for English for more).

Similarly, the short vowel letters are rarely represented in teaching reading of English in the classroom by the symbols ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, o͝o, and ŭ. The long vowels are more often represented by a horizontal line above the vowel: ā, ē, ī, ō, o͞o, and ū.

==Origin==

Vowel length may often be traced to assimilation. In Australian English, the second element of a diphthong has assimilated to the preceding vowel, giving the pronunciation of &quot;bared&quot; as , creating a contrast with the short vowel in &quot;bed&quot; .

Another common source is the vocalization of a consonant such as the voiced velar fricative or voiced palatal fricative or even an approximant, as the English &#x27;r&#x27;. A historically-important example is the laryngeal theory, which states that long vowels in the Indo-European languages were formed from short vowels, followed by any one of the several &quot;laryngeal&quot; sounds of Proto-Indo-European (conventionally written h1, h2 and h3). When a laryngeal sound followed a vowel, it was later lost in most Indo-European languages, and the preceding vowel became long. However, Proto-Indo-European had long vowels of other origins as well, usually as the result of older sound changes, such as Szemerényi&#x27;s law and Stang&#x27;s law.

Vowel length may also have arisen as an allophonic quality of a single vowel phoneme, which may have then become split in two phonemes. For example, the Australian English phoneme was created by the incomplete application of a rule extending before certain voiced consonants, a phenomenon known as the bad–lad split. An alternative pathway to the phonemicization of allophonic vowel length is the shift of a vowel of a formerly-different quality to become the short counterpart of a vowel pair. That too is exemplified by Australian English, whose contrast between (as in &quot;duck&quot;) and (as in &quot;dark&quot;) was brought about by a lowering of the earlier .

Estonian, a Finnic language, has a rare phenomenon in which allophonic length variation has become phonemic after the deletion of the suffixes causing the allophony. Estonian had already inherited two vowel lengths from Proto-Finnic, but a third one was then introduced. For example, the Finnic imperative marker *&quot;-k&quot; caused the preceding vowels to be articulated shorter. After the deletion of the marker, the allophonic length became phonemic, as shown in the example above.

==Notations==
===Latin alphabet===

====IPA====
In the International Phonetic Alphabet the sign (not a colon, but two triangles facing each other in an hourglass shape; Unicode ) is used for both vowel and consonant length. This may be doubled for an extra-long sound, or the top half () may be used to indicate that a sound is &quot;half long&quot;. A breve is used to mark an extra-short vowel or consonant.

Estonian has a three-way phonemic contrast:
:&quot;saada&quot; &quot;to get&quot; (overlong)
:&quot;saada&quot; &quot;send!&quot; (long)
:&quot;sada&quot; &quot;hundred&quot; (short)

Although not phonemic, a half-long distinction can also be illustrated in certain accents of English:
:&quot;bead&quot; 
:&quot;beat&quot; 
:&quot;bid&quot; 
:&quot;bit&quot; 

====Diacritics====
* Macron (ā), used to indicate a long vowel in Māori, Hawaiian, Samoan, Latvian and many transcription schemes, including romanizations for Sanskrit and Arabic, the Hepburn romanization for Japanese, and Yale for Korean. While not part of their standard orthography, the macron is used as a teaching aid in modern Latin and Ancient Greek textbooks. Macron is also used in modern official Cyrillic orthographies of some minority languages (Mansi, Kildin Sami, Evenki).
* Breves (ă) are used to mark short vowels in several linguistic transcription systems, as well as in Vietnamese and Alvarez-Hale&#x27;s orthography for O&#x27;odham.
* Acute accent (á), used to indicate a long vowel in Czech, Slovak, Old Norse, Hungarian, Irish, traditional Scottish Gaelic (for long [oː] ó, [eː] é, as opposed to [ɛː] è, [ɔː] ò) and pre-20th-century transcriptions of Sanskrit, Arabic, etc.
** An apex, which was a light acute accent that was angled lower and aligned with a letter&#x27;s right, was used in Classical Latin. (However, for I, a taller ꟾ was sometimes used instead.)
* Circumflex (â), used for example in Welsh. The circumflex is occasionally used as a surrogate for the macrons, particularly in Hawaiian and in the Kunrei-shiki romanization of Japanese, or in transcriptions of Old High German. In transcriptions of Middle High German, a system where inherited lengths are marked with the circumflex and new lengths with the macron is occasionally used.
* Grave accent (à) is used in Scottish Gaelic, with a e i o u. (In traditional spelling, [ɛː] is è and [ɔː] is ò as in gnè, pòcaid, Mòr (personal name), while [eː] is é and [oː] is ó, as in dé, mór.)
* Ogonek (ą), used in Lithuanian to indicate long vowels.
* Trema (ä), used in Aymara to indicate long vowels.

====Additional letters====
* &quot;Vowel doubling&quot;, used consistently in Estonian, Finnish, Lombard, Navajo and Somali, and in closed syllables in Dutch, Afrikaans, and West Frisian. Example: Finnish &quot;tuuli&quot; &#x27;wind&#x27; vs. &quot;tuli&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;.
** Estonian also has a rare &quot;overlong&quot; vowel length but does not distinguish it from the normal long vowel in writing, as they are distinguishable by context; see the example below.
* &quot;Consonant doubling&quot; after short vowels is very common in Swedish and other Germanic languages, including English. The system is somewhat inconsistent, especially in loanwords, around consonant clusters and with word-final nasal consonants. Examples:
: &quot;Consistent use:&quot; &quot;byta&quot; &#x27;to change&#x27; vs &quot;bytta&quot; &#x27;tub&#x27; and &quot;koma&quot; &#x27;coma&#x27; vs &quot;komma&quot; &#x27;to come&#x27;
: &quot;Inconsistent use:&quot; &quot;fält&quot; &#x27;a field&#x27; and &quot;kam&quot; &#x27;a comb&#x27; (but the verb &#x27;to comb&#x27; is &quot;kamma&quot;)
* Classical Milanese orthography uses consonant doubling in closed short syllables, e.g., &quot;lenguagg&quot; &#x27;language&#x27; and &quot;pubblegh&quot; &#x27;public&#x27;.
* &quot;ie&quot; is used to mark the long sound in German because of the preservation and the generalization of a historic &quot;ie&quot; spelling, which originally represented the sound . In Low German, a following &quot;e&quot; letter lengthens other vowels as well, e.g., in the name Kues .
* A following &quot;h&quot; is frequently used in German and older Swedish spelling, e.g., German &quot;Zahn&quot; &#x27;tooth&#x27;.
* In Czech, the additional letter &quot;ů&quot; is used for the long U sound, and the character is known as a kroužek, e.g., &quot;kůň&quot; &quot;horse&quot;. (It actually developed from the ligature &quot;uo&quot;, which noted the diphthong until it shifted to .)

====Other signs====
* Colon, , from Americanist phonetic notation, and used in orthographies based on it such as Oʼodham, Mohawk or Seneca. The triangular colon in the International Phonetic Alphabet derives from this.
* Middot or half-colon, , a more common variant in the Americanist tradition, also used in language orthographies.
* Saltillo (straight apostrophe), used in Miꞌkmaq, as evidenced by the name itself. This is the convention of the Listuguj orthography (Miꞌgmaq), and a common substitution for the acute accent (Míkmaq) of the Francis-Smith orthography.

====No distinction====
Some languages make no distinction in writing. This is particularly the case with ancient languages such as Old English. Modern edited texts often use macrons with long vowels, however. Australian English does not distinguish the vowels from in spelling, with words like &#x27;span&#x27; or &#x27;can&#x27; having different pronunciations depending on meaning. Other modern languages that do not represent vowel length in their standard orthography include Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Hausa.

===Other writing systems===
In non-Latin writing systems, a variety of mechanisms have also evolved.
* In abjads derived from the Aramaic alphabet, notably Arabic and Hebrew, long vowels are written with consonant letters (mostly approximant consonant letters) in a process called &quot;mater lectionis e.g.&quot; in Modern Arabic the long vowel is represented by the letter &quot;ا&quot; (Alif), the vowels and are represented by &quot;و&quot; (wāw), and the vowels and are represented by &quot;ي&quot; (yāʼ), while short vowels are typically omitted entirely. Most of these scripts also have optional diacritics that can be used to mark short vowels when needed.
* In South-Asian abugidas, such as Devanagari or the Thai alphabet, there are different vowel signs for short and long vowels.
* Ancient Greek also had distinct vowel signs, but only for some long vowels; the vowel letters (eta) and (omega) originally represented long forms of the vowels represented by the letters (epsilon, literally &quot;bare &quot;e&quot;&quot;) and &quot;ο&quot; (omicron – literally &quot;small &quot;o&quot;&quot;, by contrast with &quot;omega&quot; or &quot;large &quot;o&quot;&quot;). The other vowel letters of Ancient Greek, (alpha), (iota) and (upsilon), could represent either short or long vowel phones.
*Japanese phonology:
** In the hiragana syllabary, long vowels are usually indicated by adding a vowel character after. For vowels , , and , the corresponding independent vowel is added. Thus: (a), , &quot;okaasan&quot;, mother; (i), にいがた &quot;Niigata&quot;, city in northern Japan (usually , in kanji); (u), &quot;ryuu&quot; (usu. ), dragon. The mid-vowels and may be written with (e) (rare) ( (), neesan, &quot;elder sister&quot;) and (o) [ (usu ), ookii, big], or with (i) ( (), &quot;meirei&quot;, command/order) and (u) ( (), ousama, &quot;king&quot;) depending on etymological, morphological, and historic grounds.
** Most long vowels in the katakana syllabary are written with a special bar symbol (vertical in vertical writing), called a chōon, as in &quot;mēkā&quot; &quot;maker&quot; instead of &quot;meka&quot; &quot;mecha&quot;. However, some long vowels are written with additional vowel characters, as with hiragana, with the distinction being orthographically significant.
**Some analyses make a distinction between a long vowel and a succession of two identical vowels, citing pairs such as &quot;satōya&quot; &#x27;sugar shop&#x27; vs. . They are usually identical in normal speech, but when enunciated a distinction may be made with a pause or a glottal stop inserted between two identical vowels.
**In transcription: &quot;tsuki&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27; vs. &quot;tsūki&quot; &#x27;airflow&#x27;.
* In the Korean Hangul alphabet, vowel length is not distinguished in normal writing. Some dictionaries use a double dot, , for example &quot;Daikon radish&quot;.
* In the Classic Maya script, also based on syllabic characters, long vowels in monosyllabic roots were generally written with word-final syllabic signs ending in the vowel -&quot;i&quot; rather than an echo-vowel. Hence, &quot;chaach&quot; &quot;basket&quot;, with a long vowel, was written as &quot;cha-chi&quot; (compare &quot;chan&quot; &quot;sky&quot;, with a short vowel, written as &quot;cha-na&quot;). If the nucleus of the syllable was itself &quot;i&quot;, however, the word-final vowel for indicating length was -&quot;a&quot;: &quot;tziik&quot;- &quot;to count; to honour, to sanctify&quot; was written as &quot;tzi-ka&quot; (compare &quot;sitz&#x27; &quot;&quot;appetite&quot;, written as &quot;si-tz&#x27;i&quot;).

<doc id="992997" wikidata="Q187753" url="?curid=992997" title="Győr–Moson–Sopron County">
<text>Győr–Moson–Sopron (, ; ; ) is an administrative county (comitatus or &quot;vármegye&quot;) in north-western Hungary, on the border with Slovakia (Bratislava region, Nitra region and Trnava region) and Austria (Burgenland). It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Komárom–Esztergom, Veszprém and Vas. The capital of Győr–Moson–Sopron county is Győr. The county is a part of the Centrope project.

==History==
Győr–Sopron county was created in 1950 from two counties: Győr–Moson and Sopron. Though formed as a result of the general Communist administrative reform of that year, it is the long-term result of the impact of earlier border changes on Hungary&#x27;s western counties. In 1921 the counties of Moson and Sopron were each divided in two, with their western districts together forming the northern half of the Austrian province of Burgenland. Between 1921 and 1945, Győr and Moson became part of the &quot;provisionally and administratively unified counties of Győr–Moson–Pozsony&quot;, renamed after 1945 as simply Győr-Moson. In 1947 the borders of this county were modified when Hungary lost three villages in the far north of Győr–Moson to Czechoslovakia as a consequence of the Hungarian peace treaty signed in that year. Though Győr is the capital, there is a strong rivalry between it and Sopron, historically an important cultural centre on its own right. The county also contains Hegyeshalom, Hungary&#x27;s busiest international land border crossing point. In 1990 it was officially renamed to Győr–Moson–Sopron county.
