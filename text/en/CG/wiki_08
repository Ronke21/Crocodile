<text>Antipruritics, abirritants, or anti-itch drugs, are medications that inhibit itching (Latin: &quot;pruritus&quot;).
Itching is often associated with sunburns, allergic reactions, eczema, psoriasis, chickenpox, fungal infections, insect bites and stings like those from mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and contact dermatitis and urticaria caused by plants such as poison ivy (urushiol-induced contact dermatitis) or stinging nettle. Itching can also be caused by chronic kidney disease and related conditions.

Abirritants consist of a large group of drugs belonging to different classes with varying mechanisms to treat itch. They may work either directly or indirectly to relieve itch, and evidence on their effectiveness varies from one class to another. Some alternative medicines are also used to treat itch. Side effects of abirritants also vary depending on the class of the drug. Even before the emergence of modern evidence-based medicine, abirritants had already been used in many civilizations, but practices and choice of drugs differ by culture.

== Types ==
A number of drug classes are available as abirritants for itching relief, but there is no one single specific abirritant to treat all forms of itch. Treatments may vary depending on the cause. Commonly prescribed abirritants can be broadly divided into topical and systemic drugs, and may include a combination of one or more drugs, described as below.

===Topical===

Topical formulations are preferred for treating localized itch caused by skin damage, inflammation or dryness. Topical antipruritics in the form of creams and sprays are often available over the counter. The active ingredients usually belong to these classes:
* Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine
* Corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone topical cream, see topical steroid
* Counterirritants, such as mint oil, menthol, or camphor
* Local anesthetics such as lidocaine, pramoxine, or benzocaine in topical creams or lotions

=== Systemic drugs ===

Generalized itch, or itching across the whole body, can be a symptom of a dermatological disorder or an underlying systemic problem. Some systemic diseases can that cause generalized itch include diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney diseases and liver diseases. It is usually treated with systemic agents instead of topical agents. Corticosteroids and antihistamines mentioned above can also be used to treat generalized itch. Common systemic abirritants are listed below:

Oral antipruritics are usually prescription drugs. Those more recently described include:
* Nalfurafine, a centrally-acting κ-opioid receptor agonist approved for uremic pruritus and effective in animal models of other prurituses
* Oclacitinib, a janus kinase inhibitor used to control pruritus in dogs.

==Substances proposed to act antipruritically, but not used medically==
* Burow&#x27;s solution, an astringent aqueous solution of aluminium triacetate, is shown to soothe and to relieve itching.
* Olive oil
* Jewelweed has been shown to be devoid of any anti-itch activity in several controlled studies.
* Calamine lotion, containing zinc oxide and iron(III) oxide, is a traditional remedy for mild itching, such as that typically associated with chicken pox – although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asserted that it has little if any scientific evidence. Nevertheless, they subsequently recommended applying topical OTC skin protectants, such as calamine, to relieve the itch caused by poisonous plants such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.
* Paste of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and water, applied topically
* Ammonium hydroxide (household ammonia), applied topically
* Papain-based topical creams.

=== Alternative treatments ===
A number of herbs have been used to treat itching such as cannabis, pigweed (&quot;Portulaca oleracaea&quot;), ashoka (&quot;Saraca asoca&quot;), and fig (&quot;Ficus carica&quot;).

Other unconventional forms of treatment with potential efficacy for treating systemic itch include topical cannabinoids and H4 antihistamines.

== Effectiveness ==
Despite the availability of many forms of treatment, there is only a limited number of case series or small-scale studies examining the efficacy of abirritants. There is a lack of evidence on treatment for chronic pruritus of unknown origin. There is also little to no evidence on the efficacy and safety of using abirritants during pregnancy.

=== Treating itch associated with disease ===
Some abirritants work by indirectly treating itch through treating the causative medical conditions, which means that the itching associated with the condition will often subside when it is properly treated. This includes antihistamines and corticosteroids, which are effective in treating inflammatory disorders of the skin, in particular atopic dermatitis. Successful treatment of atopic dermatitis with either corticosteroids or antihistamines would resolve the associated itching.

=== Treating itch directly ===
Some abirritants treat pruritus directly without necessarily treating the causative medical condition. Abirritants that directly treat itching and are established to be effective are reported here in the table below:
=== Traditional Chinese medicine ===

Traditional Chinese medicine is extensively used in Asia for relief of itch. It is believed that itching is caused by irritations from wind, dampness or blood stasis, and can be relieved by the use of herbs such as chrysanthemum, gardenia fruit or mung bean. Sometimes these herbal remedies are used in combination with acupuncture and moxibustion, but their efficacy is still unclear. Sericin cream and oral omega-3 fatty acid supplements may show benefit in reducing itch.

== Adverse effects ==
Each class of abirritants has its own set of potential adverse effects.

=== Systemic corticosteroids ===

Systemic corticosteroid use has been associated with a wide range of potential adverse effects. In a review article, the following common complications were noted for prolonged use: redistribution of fat tissues (moon face), high blood sugar, infections, delayed wound healing, and HPA axis suppression, where the body&#x27;s natural production of hormones like corticotropin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone is suppressed as a response to the increased level of corticosteroids in the blood.

There is a lack of data on adverse effects associated with corticosteroid use of a shorter period and lower dose.

=== Topical corticosteroids ===
Both local and systemic side effects can result from topical corticosteroid use, especially in prolonged treatment.

Local side effects can occur regularly from prolonged use, which include skin atrophy (thinning), stretch marks, infections, lighter skin color, and sudden decrease in efficacy of the drug.

Systemic side effects are far less prevalent than local ones. Prolonged high potency corticosteroids use on thin skin, especially in children, increases the risk of systemic side effects since thin skin allows for greater absorption. One commonly cited systemic side effect from topical use is HPA axis suppression. A meta-analysis of topical corticosteroid use in children concluded that low-potency corticosteroid at recommended dosages and duration do not cause clinically significant HPA suppression.

=== Antihistamines ===
Antihistamines target the molecule histamine by blocking the histamine H1 receptor. First-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine are able to move from the blood into the brain across the blood–brain barrier, where they block the H1 receptor, reducing the neurotransmitter effect of histamine, leading to central nervous system side effects such as drowsiness and confusion. Second generation antihistamines, such as fexofenadine and cetirizine are less able to move from blood circulation into the brain and are therefore associated with fewer side effects in usual doses.

=== μ-Opioid receptor antagonists ===
μ-opioid receptor antagonists are usually well-tolerated and have no abuse potential since they do not cause physical dependence. Side effects are dose-dependent and generally limited to the first two weeks of treatment. Opioid withdrawal symptoms are rare and may include severe lightheadedness, depersonalization and anxiety.

=== Antidepressants ===
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including both serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are generally well tolerated. Common side effects include:
* Sexual dysfunction, which is the most common side effect of all serotonin reuptake inhibitors, manifesting as delayed ejaculation, inability to achieve orgasm and decreased libido.
* Gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting, which depend on the dose and usually resolve within the first two weeks of treatment.
* Central nervous system disturbances such as anxiety, insomnia and sedation.
* Suicide risk: a combined analysis of placebo-controlled trials of various antidepressants including SSRIs in children and adolescents showed a doubled risk of suicide in those taking antidepressants. In response, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2004 regarding the elevated risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents.

=== Immunosuppressants ===
Immunosuppressants may cause immunodeficiency, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infection. Other side effects include bone marrow suppression, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and increased risk of cancer.

=== Capsaicin ===
Being the main chemical that causes heat in chili pepper, the main side effect of capsaicin is a burning sensation that usually persists for several days. A topical anaesthetic can be used to reduce the sensation. In addition, the topical anaesthetic can also provide anti-itch effect on its own.

== History ==

Abirritants have an extensive history in treating itch. The history of abirritants dates back to the Byzantine period, when Alexander of Tralleis, a famous physician, recommended crushed rue and alum mixed in honey for topical application to the scalp for itching caused by scabby conditions of the head.

During the 7th century, Paul of Aegina, a famous Greek physician, described a list of drugs for treatment of itch including plants such as the squill, metallic components, and goat droppings which were applied externally. These drugs are common in ancient pharmacopeia.

The &quot;Lorscher Azneibuch&quot; written in the monastery of Lorsch in the 7th century described many preparations of abirritants for both systemic and topical use, such as an ointment prepared from stinging nettle seeds.

Mercury-coated girdles were used in the 17th century as an expensive treatment to alleviate symptoms of itch caused by scabies, but mercury toxins in the blood often caused other troubling symptoms in patients.

In the 20th century, many new abirritants for external use emerged, including salicylic acids, naphthol, tar, carbolic acid, thymol, and menthol, which were mostly available in the form of ointments. Alcohol and opium were also commonly prescribed.

<doc id="975670" wikidata="Q6403113" url="?curid=975670" title="Khurram Khan">
<text>Khurram Khan (born 21 June 1971) is a Pakistani-born cricketer who played for the United Arab Emirates national cricket team. In 2014, Khurram became the oldest player to score an ODI hundred as his unbeaten 132 helped his team to a six-wicket victory over Afghanistan in Dubai. He is regarded as the best cricketer to play for the United Arab Emirates.

== Career ==

Khan has been playing for the UAE since 2001 when he turned out for the team at the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, where he played ten games over the course of the two-week tournament. With 243 runs over eight innings, Khurram had the highest batting average of the UAE team with 60.75, though Ahmed Nadeem and Arshad Ali both made more runs. He also bowled the most for UAE, taking 19 wickets in his 95 overs, at a bowling average of 13.52 - taking joint third-most wickets of the tournament, behind Roland Lefebvre and Soren Vestergaard.

Despite Khurram&#x27;s performances, the UAE finished fifth at the tournament, and failed to qualify for the 2003 World Cup. Khurram was named captain for the ICC Six Nations Challenge in March 2004, a qualifier tournament for the ICC Champions Trophy, and though Khurram was once again leading wicket-taker for the UAE, the team finished fifth on net run rate, coming last after four other teams on points.

Khurram was retained as captain for the 2004 Asia Cup, however, where the UAE took on the Test nations of India and Sri Lanka. They were eliminated after two group stage matches, though Cricinfo claimed that he and his teammates &quot;bowled with plenty of discipline and control&quot; in the first match against India, and &quot;a maturity far beyond their experience&quot; in the second match.

Khurram got one wicket in his first match, with the last ball of a ten-over spell, and took four for 32 in ten overs against Sri Lanka, including the top scorer of the innings Avishka Gunawardene who lofted a catch to the deep for 73. He was the leading bowler as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 239, but only contributed with eight runs in the chase as UAE were bowled out for 123 and knocked out of the tournament.

Khurram has played four matches at the ICC Intercontinental Cup, three in 2004 and one in 2005, scoring 329 runs with four fifties and taking eight wickets. He has not been the leading wicket-taker in that tournament, with Ali Asad outperforming him with 35 scalps in five matches.

Khurram was captain at the 2005 ICC Trophy, leading his team to a fifth place play-off where the winner would qualify for the 2007 World Cup. After bowling eight overs without a wicket at the Dutch batsmen, Khurram was dismissed for six in the UAE&#x27;s total of 142, and the UAE lost by 143 runs to miss out on a World Cup berth. Three months later, Khurram had to declare himself unavailable for the semi-final of the 2005 Intercontinental Cup, with Arshad Ali captaining the side in his place. 

He scored his only ODI century of 132* against Afghanistan. With this century, he became the oldest ever player to score an ODI century at the age of 43, passing Sri Lanka&#x27;s Sanath Jayasuriya, who scored his final century when he was at 39 years of age.

In June 2015, following the UAE&#x27;s defeat to Ireland in the 2015–17 ICC Intercontinental Cup, Khurram announced his retirement from international cricket.

<text>Arshad Ali (born 6 April 1976) is a former Pakistani-born cricketer who played for the United Arab Emirates national cricket team.

Ali was born in Sialkot, Pakistan. He was taught cricket by his brother Shafiq Ahmed, who moved to the UAE in 1991. Ali subsequently followed his brother to Dubai and excelled in local domestic cricket, winning an award as the Dubai Cricket Council&#x27;s best junior player. He reportedly scored 35 centuries in six years in local tournaments through to 2001. His nephew and Shafiq&#x27;s son is Pakistan international Abdullah Shafique.

Ali represented the UAE at the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada, notably scoring a century against Ireland. He was named man of the match in the final of the 2002 ACC Trophy after taking 4/24 against Nepal. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut for the UAE against India at the 2004 Asia Cup. He played three further ODIs, one more at the 2004 Asia Cup and two at the 2008 Asia Cup, with a highest score of 41 against Bangladesh in 2008.

In the opening match of the 2006 ACC Trophy, Ali scored 213 not out against Brunei to lead the UAE to a 367-run win. His highest score in first-class cricket was 185 against Bermuda in the 2007–08 ICC Intercontinental Cup. Only two weeks later, he took career-best List A figures of 7/41 against Denmark in 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division Two.

In 2010, Ali took 3/7 against the English county team Sussex in the final of the Emirates Airline Twenty20, leading the Emirates XI to an unlikely 14-run victory, defending a paltry total of 85. His final match for the UAE, against Canada, was during the ICC World Cricket League Championship in 2013.

<text>Bósa saga ok Herrauds or Saga of Bósi and Herraud is a legendary saga, relating the fantastic adventures of the two companions Herraud (Old Norse &quot;Herrauðr&quot;) and Bósi. It is first attested in three manuscripts from the 15th century, AM 343 a 4to, AM 577 4to, and AM 586 4to.
==Summary==
This summary recounts the story of the older of the two main recensions of &quot;Bósa saga&quot;, which is the one that is usually edited and translated.
===The setup===
The story begins with King Hring (&quot;Hringr&quot;) of Östergötland, who is said to be son of King Gauti son of King Odin of Sweden and half-brother to King Gautrekr the Generous, who appears as king of Västergötland in &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;. But chronology is flattened so that Hring is made a contemporary of Harald Wartooth, King of Denmark and Sweden. Hring&#x27;s wife is Sylgja daughter of Jarl Sæfara (&#x27;Seafarer&#x27;) of Småland. Sæfara also has two sons, named Dagfari (&quot;Dayfarer&quot;) and Náttfari (&quot;Nightfarer&quot;), who serve King Harald.

Herraud, the primary hero of the saga, is the son of Hring and his wife Sylgja. But Hring also has an illegitimate son named Sjód (&quot;Sjóðr&quot;), who serves as Hring&#x27;s treasurer and tax collector and from whose name, according to the saga, the word &quot;sjóðr&quot; (&quot;purse&quot;) derives. Hring prefers Sjód to Herraud.

Herraud&#x27;s best friend is Bósi, the younger son of a former viking named Thvari or Bryn-Thvari by Brynhild, a former shieldmaiden and a daughter of King Agnar of Nóatún. (Thvari had formerly partially maimed Brynhild in a duel, whence she was known as Bögu-Brynhild &quot;Stunt-Brynhild&quot;, for she never fully recovered. Thvari then married Brynhild, who bore him two sons, Smid (&quot;Smiðr&quot;) and Bósi. Smid learned some magic from their foster mother Busla, who was a powerful sorceress.) Bósi is sometimes called Bögu-Bósi after his mother.

Bósi is a rough boy who is eventually outlawed for maiming some other folk in a ball-game. Herraud, discontented, gains permission from his father, over Sjód&#x27;s objections, be allowed to set off on a Viking expedition with five ships. Herraud is eventually joined by the exiled Bósi and they successfully plunder for five years. Meanwhile, back in East Götaland, Herraud&#x27;s half-brother Sjód extorts funds from Bósi&#x27;s father Thvari under the pretence that this is legal compensation for those men whom Bósi has injured. Now it chances that Bósi&#x27;s ship was driven to Wendland, where Sjód happens to be on a purchasing expedition for King Hring. Bósi and Sjód quarrel over the matter and Bósi kills Sjód.

Herraud then returns to his father&#x27;s court, offering to make compensation for Sjód&#x27;s death; but King Hring refuses all offers. Civil war breaks out between father and son. Hring manages to capture Herraud and Bósi and prepares to execute them. But that night Busla, Bósi&#x27;s foster-mother, noted for her magic powers, appears suddenly in King Hring&#x27;s bedchamber, and harasses the king with a curses known as &quot;Buslubæn&quot; (&#x27;Busla&#x27;s prayer&#x27;) until the helpless king agrees to make peace with Herraud and Bósi to the extent of sending them on a dangerous quest instead of executing them.

===The quest===
The following day Hring exiles both Herraud and Bósi, Herraud for life and Bósi the same unless Bósi can find and bring back a vulture&#x27;s egg inscribed with golden letters.

The two head off to Bjarmaland and have many adventures. An erotic encounter between Bósi and a farmer&#x27;s daughter is told in amusingly explicit riddling dialogue. The two companions are able to kill a vulture that guards the temple of Jomali in Bjarmaland, obtaining its egg; they slay the priestess Kolfrosta, the mother of King Harek of Bjarmaland; and they rescue Hleid (&quot;Hleið&quot;), the sister of King Godmund (&quot;Guðmundr&quot;) of Glæsisvellir, who has been magically brought there to be turned into the new priestess. Herraud takes Hleid as his wife and they and Bósi return to East Götaland where King Hring, on receiving the shell of the vulture&#x27;s egg, is reconciled with Bósi and his son.

===Further adventures===
At that point Herraud and Bósi head off to aid King Harald in the famous Battle of Bråvalla and are among the few survivors.

Meanwhile, King Godmund of Glæsisvellir, not knowing what has become of his sister Hleid, promises Siggeir, son of King Harek of Bjarmaland, that Siggeir can have her as his wife if he can find her. Siggeir and his brother Hrærek learn about Hleid&#x27;s abduction from Bjarmaland by Herraud and Bósi and their destruction of the temple, and they set out for Götaland. There they attack King Hring who has small strength with him, most of his forces having gone to Bråvalla. Hring is killed in battle and Hleid is taken back to Glæsisvellir.

On their return from Bråvalla, Herraud and Bósi, accompanied by Bósi&#x27;s brother Smid and Bosi&#x27;s foster-mother Busla, set out to rescue Hleid. They accomplish their goal after many further adventures (and two further erotic encounters between Bósi and two maidens with riddling dialogues). Herraud regains Hleid and Bósi abducts King Harek&#x27;s daughter Edda. Both Smid and Busla show their magical prowess. When King Harek of Bjarmaland attacks in the form of a giant boar, a giant bitch (apparently Busla) opposes him. Both fall into the sea and are never heard of again.

===Epilogue===
Herraud becomes king of East Götaland as heir to his father while Bósi becomes king of Bjarmaland by his marriage to Edda. By one of his other erotic encounters Bósi becomes the father of Svidi the Bold, the father of Vilmund the Absentminded.

Meanwhile, Herraud and Hleid become the parents of a daughter, that same famous Þóra Town-Hart (&quot;Þóra Borgarhjörtr&quot;) who kept a serpent in her bower and only he who could slay it could gain her hand in marriage. The eventual slayer and husband is the famous Ragnar Lódbrok. The tale explains at the end that this serpent had sprung from the vulture&#x27;s egg which Herraud and Bósi had obtained in their quest.

==Other references to Herraud==
This tale of Ragnar and the serpent also appears in &quot;Ragnars saga loðbrókar&quot; and &quot;Þáttr af Ragnars sonum&quot;, though in the former Herraud appears as Jarl Herrud (&quot;Herruðr&quot;) of Gautland and in the latter as Herraud, Jarl of West Götaland. But Herraud&#x27;s father is also called Hring in this version. A variant with two serpents instead of one appears in Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 9) where Herraud appears as Herothus King of Sweden. None of these accounts explain the origin of the serpent or serpents and it would seem that the story of Herraud and Bósi was in part invented as a prequel to fill that gap.

==Alternate forms of names==
* Herraud: &quot;Herrauðr&quot;; Herrud (&quot;Herruðr&quot;); Herothus, &quot;Anglicized as&quot; Heroth, Herodd.
* Bósi: &quot;Anglicized as&quot; Bosi.

<text>Abdul Rehman (born 2 January 1987) is a former cricketer who played for the United Arab Emirates national cricket team between 2004 and 2011.

A wicketkeeper and useful lower-order right-handed batsman, Abdul Rehman was plucked from the obscurity of the UAE Under-17 squad into the national team for the 2004 Asia Cup.

He made his One Day International debut for the UAE against a strong Indian team but was not selected in the team for the next game against tournament hosts Sri Lanka.

His last international outing was against Afghanistan in an ICC Intercontinental Cup game in October 2011.

<text>In geology, a dike or dyke is a sheet of rock that is formed in a fracture of a pre-existing rock body. Dikes can be either magmatic or sedimentary in origin. Magmatic dikes form when magma flows into a crack then solidifies as a sheet intrusion, either cutting across layers of rock or through a contiguous mass of rock. Clastic dikes are formed when sediment fills a pre-existing crack.

==Magmatic dikes==

A magmatic dike is a sheet of igneous rock that cuts across older rock beds. It is formed when magma fills a fracture in the older beds and then cools and solidifies. The dike rock is usually more resistant to weathering than the surrounding rock, so that erosion exposes the dike as a natural wall or ridge. It is from these natural walls that dikes get their name.

Dikes preserve a record of the fissures through which most mafic magma (fluid magma low in silica) reaches the surface. They are studied by geologists for the clues they provide on volcanic plumbing systems. They also record ancient episodes of extension of the Earth&#x27;s crust, since large numbers of dikes (&quot;dike swarms&quot;) are formed when the crust is pulled apart by tectonic forces. The dikes show the direction of extension, since they form at right angles to the direction of maximum extension.

===Description===
The thickness of a dike is much smaller than its other two dimensions, and the opposite walls are roughly parallel, so that a dike is more or less constant in thickness. The thickness of different dikes can range from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, but is most typically from about a meter to a few tens of meters. The lateral extent can be tens of kilometers, and dikes with a thickness of a few tens of meters or more commonly extend for over 100 km. Most dikes are steeply dipping; in other words, they are oriented nearly vertically. Subsequent tectonic deformation may rotate the sequence of strata through which the dike propagates so that the dike becomes horizontal.
It is common for a set of dikes, each a few kilometers long, to form &quot;en echelon&quot;. This pattern is seen in the Higganum dike set of New England. This dike set consists of individual dikes that are typically four kilometers in length at the surface and up to 60 meters wide. These short segments form longer groups extending for around 10 km. The entire set of dikes forms a line extending for 250 km. Individual segments overlap, with the overlapping portions thinner, so that the combined thickness of the two overlapped portions is about the same as the thickness of a single segment. Other examples of &quot;en echelon&quot; dikes are the Inyo dike of Long Valley, California, US; the Jagged Rocks complex, Arizona, US; and the dikes of oceanic spreading centers.

Dikes range in composition from basaltic to rhyolitic, but most are basaltic. The texture is typically slightly coarser than basalt erupted at the surface, forming a rock type called diabase. The grain size varies systematically across the dike, with the coarsest grains normally at the center of the dike. Dikes formed at shallow depth commonly have a glassy or fine-grained chilled margin 1 to 5 cm thick, formed where the magma was rapidly cooled by contact with the cold surrounding rock. Shallow dikes also typically show columnar jointing perpendicular to the margins. Here the dike rock fractures into columns as it cools and contracts. These are usually 5- to 6-sided, but 3- to 4-sided columns are also common. These are fairly uniform in size within a single dike, but range from a few centimeters to over 0.3 meters across in different dikes, tending to be thicker in wider dikes. Larger columns are likely a consequence of slower cooling.

Dike rock is usually dense, with almost no vesicles (frozen bubbles), but vesicles may be seen in the shallowest part of a dike. When vesicles are present, they tend to form bands parallel to walls and are elongated in direction of flow. Likewise, phenocrysts (larger crystals) on the margins of the dike show an alignment in the direction of flow.

In contrast to dikes, which cut across the bedding of layered rock, a sill is a sheet intrusion that forms within and parallel to the bedding.

===Formation===
Mafic magma (fluid magma low in silica) usually reaches the surface through fissures, forming dikes.

At the shallowest depths, dikes form when magma rises into an existing fissure. In the young, shallow dikes of the Hawaiian Islands, there is no indication of forceful intrusion of magma. For example, there is little penetration of magma into the walls of dikes even when the walls consist of highly porous volcanic clinker, and little wall material breaks off into the molten magma. These fissures likely open as a result of bulging of the rock beds above a magma chamber that is being filled with magma from deeper in the crust.

However, open fractures can exist only near the surface. Magma deeper in the crust must force its way through the rock, always opening a path along a plane normal to the minimum principal stress. This is the direction in which the crust is under the weakest compression and so requires the least work to fracture. At shallow depths, where the rock is brittle, the pressurized magma progressively fractures the rock as it advances upwards. Even if the magma is only slightly pressurized compared with the surrounding rock, tremendous stress is concentrated on the tip of the propagating fracture. In effect, the magma wedges apart the brittle rock in a process called &quot;hydraulic fracture&quot;. At greater depths, where the rock is hotter and less brittle, the magma forces the rock aside along brittle shear planes oriented 35 degrees to the sides of the dock. This bulldozer-like action produces a blunter dike tip. At the greatest depths, the shear planes become ductile faults, angled 45 degree from the sides of the dike. At depths where the rock is completely plastic, a diapir (a rising plug of magma) forms instead of a dike.

The walls of dikes often fit closely back together, providing strong evidence that the dike formed by dilatation of a fissure. However, a few large dikes, such as the 120-meter-thick Medford dike in Maine, US, or the 500-meter-thick Gardar dike in Greenland, show no dilatation. These may have formed by &quot;stoping&quot;, in which the magma fractured and disintegrated the rock at its advancing tip rather than prying the rock apart. Other dikes may have formed by &quot;metasomatism&quot;, in which fluids moving along a narrow fissure changed the chemical composition of the rock closest to the fissure.

There is an approximate relationship between the width of a dike and its maximum extent, expressed by the formula:

formula_1

Here formula_2 is the thickness of the dike; formula_3 is its lateral extent; formula_4 is the excess pressure in the magma relative to the host rock; formula_5 is the density of the host rock; and formula_6 is the P-wave velocity of the host rock (essentially, the speed of sound in the rock). This formula predicts that dikes will be longer and narrower at greater depths below the surface. The ratio of thickness to length is around 0.01 to 0.001 near the surface, but at depth it ranges from 0.001 to 0.0001. A surface dike 10 meters in thickness will extend about 3 km, while a dike of similar thickness at depth will extend about 30 km. This tendency of intruding magma to form shorter fissures at shallower depths has been put forward as an explanation of &quot;en echelon&quot; dikes. However, &quot;en echelon&quot; dikes have also been explained as a consequence of the direction of minimum principal stress changing as the magma ascends from deep to shallow levels in the crust.

An &quot;en echelon&quot; dike set may evolve into single dike with &quot;bridges&quot; connecting the formerly separate segments and &quot;horns&quot; showing former segment overlaps. In ancient dikes in deformed rock, the bridges and horns are used by geologists to determine the direction of magma flow.

Where there is rapid flow of molten magma through a fissure, the magma tends to erode the walls, either by melting the wall rock or by tearing off fragments of wall rock. This widens the fissure and increases flow. Where flow is less rapid, the magma may solidify next to the wall, narrowing the fissure and decreasing flow. This causes flow to become concentrated at a few points. At Hawaii, eruptions often begin with a &quot;curtain of fire&quot; where lava erupts along the entire length of a fissure several kilometers long. However, the length of erupting fissure diminishes over time, becoming focused on a short segment of less than half a kilometer. The minimum possible width of a dike is determined by the balance between magma movement and cooling.

===Multiple and composite dikes===

There may be more than one injection of magma along a given fissure. When multiple injections are all of similar composition, the dike is described as a &quot;multiple dike&quot;. However, subsequent injections are sometimes quite different in composition, and then the dike is described as a &quot;composite dike&quot;. The range of compositions in a composite dike can go all the way from diabase to granite, as is observed in some dikes of Scotland and northern Ireland.

After the initial formation of a dike, subsequent injections of magma are most likely to take place along the center of the dike. If the previous dike rock has cooled significantly, the subsequent injection can be characterized by fracturing of the old dike rock and the formation of chilled margins on the new injection.

===Dike swarms===
Sometimes dikes appear in swarms, consisting of several to hundreds of dikes emplaced more or less contemporaneously during a single intrusive event. Dike swarms are almost always composed of diabase and most often are associated with flood basalts of large igneous provinces. They are characteristic of divergent plate boundaries. For example, Jurassic dike swarms in New England and Paleogene swarms in the west of Scotland and running into northern England record the early opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Dike swarms are forming in the present day along the divergent plate boundary running through Iceland. Dike swarms often have a great cumulative thickness: Dikes in Iceland average 3 to 5 meters in width, but one 53-kilometer stretch of coast has about 1000 dikes with total thickness of 3 kilometers. The world&#x27;s largest dike swarm is the Mackenzie dike swarm in the Northwest Territories, Canada.

Dike swarms (also called &quot;dike complexes&quot;) are exposed in the eroded rift zones of Hawaiian volcanoes. As with most other magmatic dikes, these were fissures through which lava reached the surface. The swarms are typically 2.5 to 5 km in width, with individual dikes about a meter in width. The dike swarms extend radially out from volcano summits and parallel to the long axis of the volcanic shield. Sills and stocks are occasionally present in the complexes. They are abruptly truncated at the margins of summit calderas. Typically, there are about 50 to 100 dikes per kilometer at the center of the rift zone, though the density can be as high as 500 per kilometer and the dikes then make up half the volume of the rock. The density drops to 5 to 50 per kilometer away from the center of the rift zone before abruptly dropping to very few dikes. It is likely that the number of dikes must increase with depth, reaching a typical value of 300 to 350 per kilometer at the level of the ocean floor. In some respects, these dike swarms resemble those of western Scotland associated with the flood eruptions that preceded the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

Dikes often form as radial swarms from a central volcano or intrusion. Though they appear to originate in the central intrusion, the dikes often have a different age and composition from the intrusion. These radial swarms may have formed over the intrusion and were later cut by the rising body of magma, or the crust was already experiencing regional tension and the intrusion triggered formation of the fissures.

===Sheeted dike complexes===

In rock of the oceanic crust, pillow lava erupted onto the sea floor is underlain by &quot;sheeted dike complexes&quot; that preserve the conduits through which magma reached the ocean floor at mid-ocean ridges. These sheeted dikes characteristically show a chilled margin on only one side, indicating that each dike was split in half by a subsequent eruption of magma.

===Ring dikes and cone sheets===
Ring dikes and cone sheets are special types of dikes associated with caldera volcanism. These are distributed around a shallow magma chamber. Cone sheets form when magma is injected into a shallow magma chamber, which lifts and fractures the rock beds above it. The fractures take the form of a set of concentric cones dipping at a relatively shallow angle into the magma chamber. When the caldera is subsequently emptied by explosive volcanic activity, the roof of the magma chamber collapses as a plug of rock surrounded by a ring fracture. Magma rising into the ring fracture produces a ring dike. Good examples of ring dikes and cone sheets are found in the Ardnamurchan peninsula of Scotland.

===Other special types===
A feeder dike is a dike that acted as a conduit for magma moving from a magma chamber to a localized intrusion. For example, the Muskox intrusion in arctic Canada was fed by a large dike, with a thickness of 150 meters.
A sole injection is a dike injected along a thrust fault plane, where rock beds were fractured and thrust up over younger beds.

==Clastic dikes==
Clastic dikes (also known as sedimentary dikes) are vertical bodies of sedimentary rock that cut off other rock layers. They can form in two ways:
*When shallow unconsolidated sediment is composed of alternating coarse-grained and impermeable clay layers the fluid pressure inside the coarser layers may reach a critical value due to lithostatic overburden. Driven by the fluid pressure the sediment breaks through overlying layers and forms a dike.
*When a soil is under permafrost conditions the pore water is totally frozen. When cracks are formed in such rocks, they may fill up with sediments that fall in from above. The result is a vertical body of sediment that cuts through horizontal layers, a dike.

<text>Thomas Keightley (17 October 1789 – 4 November 1872) was an Irish writer known for his works on mythology and folklore, particularly &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; (1828), later reprinted as &quot;The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves, and Other Little People&quot; (1978, 2000, etc.).

Keightley was as an important pioneer in the study of folklore by modern scholars in the field. He was a &quot;comparativist&quot; folklore collector, drawing parallels between tales and traditions across cultures. A circumspect scholar, he did not automatically assume similar tales indicated transmission, allowing for the possibility that similar tales arose independently.

At the request of the educator Thomas Arnold, he authored a series of textbooks on English, Greek, and other histories, which were adopted at Arnold&#x27;s Rugby School as well as other public schools.

==Life and travels==
Keightley, born in October 1789, was the son of Thomas Keightley of Newtown, County Kildare, and claimed to be related to Thomas Keightley (1650?–1719). He entered Trinity College Dublin, on 4 July 1803, but left without a degree, and due to poor health he was forced to abandon the pursuit of the legal profession and admission to the Irish Bar.

In 1824 he settled in London, and engaged in literary and journalistic work. Keightley is known to have contributed tales to Thomas Crofton Croker&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Legends of South Ireland&quot; (1825), though not properly acknowledged. It turned out that he submitted at least one tale (&quot;The Soul Cages&quot;) almost entirely of his own fabrication unbeknown to Croker and others.

Having spent time in Italy, he was capable of producing translations of tales from &quot;Pentamerone&quot; or &quot;The Nights of Straparola&quot; in &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot;, and he struck up a friendship with the patriarch of the Rossetti household. Thomas claimed to be literate in twenty-odd languages and dialects in all, and published a number of translations and digests of medieval and foreign works and passages, often sparsely treated elsewhere in the English language, including the expanded prose versions of &quot;Ogier the Dane&quot; which conveys the hero to Morgan le Fay&#x27;s Fairyland, or Swedish ballads on nixes and elves, such as &quot;Harpans kraft&quot; (&quot;Power of the Harp&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sir Olof in Elve-Dance&quot;).

==Folklore and mythology ==

Keithley was one of &quot;early and important comparativist collectors&quot; of folklore, and &quot;For an early book of folklore &quot;The Fairy Mythology&quot; sets high standards&quot;.

===Fairy Mythology===
In 1828 Keightley published &quot;Fairy Mythology,&quot; 2 vols., illustrated by W. H. Brooke. A German translation by &quot;Mythologie der feen und elfen&quot; (1828) quickly appeared. Jacob Grimm is said to have praised the work. It was popular among Victorian folklore researchers and literary figures in its day; an expanded edition appeared in 1850, and a newly prefaced one in 1860. It has subsequently been reissued intermittently up to modern times, vindicating Keightley&#x27;s own &quot;high hopes of immortality for his work&quot; in his preface, despite an early biographer calling this &quot;pretentious&quot;.

Keightley is regarded as an early practitioner in England of the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s approach to the study of myth and folklore, exploring the parallels between the myth of a nation to the religions and mythology of other regions. Thus Keightley began by attempting to trace fairy myth to Gothic and Teutonic roots, as the Grimms had done for elves. Keightley, like the Grimms, eventually reached the conclusion that it was implausible to trace a myth to an ultimate single source, and that parallel myths can be explained by the &quot;Enlightenment idea that human nature [that] is uniform,&quot; and similar experiences and responses are shared across mankind.

==== Conflict over credit ====
Keightley had contributed to T. Crofton Croker&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Legend&quot; (1825–1828), and Keightley being stimulated to write his own book was perhaps the most important consequence of Croker&#x27;s publication. But it was an uneasy situation, as Keightley was clearly peeved at Croker for not properly acknowledging Keightley&#x27;s aid, even though in the preface to the 1850 edition, Keightley explains the circumstances more cordially, addresses Croker as &quot;one of my earliest literary friends in London&quot;.

A selection in &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; was an Irish mermaid story entitled &quot;The Soul Cages,&quot; which turned out to be a hoax of sorts. The male merrow story was first printed in Croker&#x27;s anthology, but Keightley came out with a later edition of the &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; he added a footnote to this tale, proclaiming he &quot;must here make an honest confession,&quot; and informed the reader that except for the kernel of the story adapted from the German story of &quot;The Peasant and the Waterman&quot;, this Irish tale was entirely his invention.

====Publication history====
The &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; underwent several printings (1833, 1850, 1878, etc.) in the 19th century. The 1878 edition was reprinted a century later retitled as &quot;The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves and Other Little People&quot; (New York: Avenel Books, 1978).

===Mythology of Ancient Greece===
Keightley&#x27;s &quot;The Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy for the Use of School&quot; (1831) was applauded by Thirlwall for making the subject &quot;fit for ladies.&quot; In it, Cronus&#x27;s use of the adamant sickle (&quot;harpē&quot;) to emasculate his father has been euphemized as an act of Uranus being &quot;mutilated&quot;. It has been noted that Keightley took a more historico-scientific, as opposed to theological approach to Greek mythology.

===Tales and Popular Fictions===
Keightley&#x27;s &quot;Tales and Popular Fictions; their Resemblances and Transmissions from Country to Country,&quot; appeared in 1834. He divided the book into three parts, tales which he believed were transmitted to Europe from the Middle East, tale groups demonstrating striking similarity but which he thought were independently conceived, and those which confounded him.

==Historical works==
Keightley was long occupied in compiling historical manuals for instructional use and popular enlightenment. His &quot;Outlines of History&quot; was one of the early volumes of Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopædia&quot; (1829). His &quot;History of the War of Greek Independence&quot; (1830) forms volumes lx. and lxi. of &quot;Constable&#x27;s Miscellany.&quot;

After the &quot;Outlines,&quot; Keightley was urged by the educator Thomas Arnold of Rugby School to undertake work on a series of mid-sized histories to be used in schools. &quot;History of England&quot; (1837–39), 2 vols., although based on John Lingard, was intended to counteract that writer&#x27;s Catholic tendencies. Other textbooks followed: &quot;History of Greece&quot; (1835); Rome (1836); Roman Empire (1840); India in (1846–7). His &quot;History of Greece&quot; was translated into modern Greek. Keightley also compiled as a study tool &quot;Questions on Keightley&#x27;s History of Greece&quot; and Rome (1836), and one on English history (1840) consisted of a long list of history quizzes organized by chapter, for young students of his Roman, Greek, and histories.

Keightley stated he sought to create history material for the schoolroom which were an improvement on Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, thought himself equal to the task, and found his proof when his titles were &quot;adopt(ed).. immediately on their appearance&quot; by &quot;Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, and most of the other great public schools, besides a number of private ones.&quot; In 1850, Keightley wrote immodestly of his historical output as &quot;yet unrivalled, and may long be unsurpassed.&quot; Keightley&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; was derivative of the labors of the German classical historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, and Keightley&#x27;s patron or mentor Arnold was a subscriber of Niebuhr&#x27;s approach.

Samuel Warren, in his &quot;Legal Studies,&quot; 3rd ed. 1854 (i. 235–6, 349), highly praises his historical work. But he ludicrously overestimated all his performances, and his claim to have written the best history of Rome in any language, or to be the first to justly value Virgil and Sallust, could not be admitted by his friends. During the last years of his life he received a pension from the civil list. He died at Erith, Kent, on 4 Nov 1872.

Besides the works already mentioned Keightley was author of &quot;The Crusaders, or Scenes, Events, and Characters from the times of the Crusaders&quot; (1834). His &quot;Secret Societies of the Middle Ages&quot; (&quot;Library of Entertaining Knowledge&quot; 1837) was initially published anonymously, and against his wish, and later reprinted in 1848.

==Literary criticisms==
Keightley edited Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Bucolics and Georgics&quot; (1847), which was prefigured by his &quot;Notes on the Bucolics and Georgics of Virgil with Excursus, terms of Husbandry, and a Flora Virgiliana,&quot; (1846). Other Latin classics he edited were Horace, &quot;Satires and Epistles&quot; (1848), Ovid, &quot;Fasti&quot; (1848), and Sallust, &quot;Catilina and Jugurtha&quot; (1849).

===Milton studies===
Keightley produced an annotated edition of Milton (2 vols. 1859) as well as his critical biography &quot;Account of the Life, Opinions, and Writings of John Milton, with an Introduction to Paradise Lost&quot; (1855). His nuggets of insight have been occasionally invoked, compared, and contradicted in studies into the 20th century and beyond. He is listed among the &quot;distinguished file&quot; in one survey of past commentaries on Milton, going back three centuries ().

Appreciation of allusions in Milton&#x27;s poems require familiarity with classical Greco-Roman mythology and epics; to borrow the words of an American contemporary Thomas Bulfinch: &quot;Milton abounds in .. allusions&quot; to classical mythology, and especially &quot;scattered profusely&quot; throughout Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Keightley was one annotator who meticulously tracked Milton&#x27;s mythological sources. Some of Keightley&#x27;s flawed commentary have been pointed out. He argued that Milton erred when he spoke of &quot;Titan, Heaven&#x27;s first-born,&quot; there being no single divine being named Titan, only a race of titans. Though that may be so according to the genealogy laid out by Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, it has been pointed out that Milton could well have used alternate sources, such as Lactantius&#x27;s &quot;Divinae Institutiones&quot; (&quot;Divine Institutes&quot;), which quotes Ennius to the effect that Uranus had two sons, Titan and Saturn.

Likewise regarding Milton&#x27;s angelology, Keightley had made some correct observations, but he had constrained the source mostly to the Bible, and made mistakes, such as to identify the angel Ithuriel as a coinage.

===Other commentary===
Keightley also published an unannotated edition of Shakespeare (6 vols. 1864), followed by a study guide entitled &quot;Shakespeare Expositor: an aid to the perfect understanding of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays&quot; (1867).

Keightley is credited with first noticing that Chaucer&#x27;s Squire&#x27;s Tale is paralleled by, and hence may have drawn from, the Old French romance, Adenes Le Roi&#x27;s &quot;Cléomadès&quot;.

He also wrote of Henry Fielding&#x27;s peculiarism of using the antiquated &quot;hath&quot; and &quot;doth&quot; ( &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, 1858), without acknowledging a commentator who made the same observation before him.

==Friends and family==
Keightley, a friend to Gabriele Rossetti, and firm supporter of the latter&#x27;s views on Dante became one of a handful of non-Italians who socialized with the family in the childhood days of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his siblings. Keightley&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Mythology&quot; was one of the books Dante Gabriel pored over until age ten.

William Michael Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Memoir&quot; notes that Keightley had as &quot;his nephew and adopted son, Mr. Alfred Chaworth Lyster&quot; who became a dear friend. A pen and ink likeness of this nephew by Dante Gabriel Rossetti exists, dated 1855. Writings from the Rossetti family provide some other loose information on Keightley&#x27;s related kin or on his later private life. A record by William Rossetti of a spiritual séance at Keightley&#x27;s home at Belvedere on 4 January 1866, amusing in its own right, identifies &quot;two Misses Keightley&quot; in attendance, a kinsman named &quot;William Samuel Keightley&quot; who died in 1856 supposed to have made his spiritual presence in the session. It has also been remarked that by this period, Keightley had become as &quot;stone-deaf&quot; as Seymour Kirkup, a person who was corresponding with Keightley on matters of spiritualism and visions.

<doc id="975711" wikidata="Q6306023" url="?curid=975711" title="Jules Shear">
<text>Jules Mark Shear (born March 7, 1952) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He wrote the Cyndi Lauper hit single &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, the Bangles&#x27; hit &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, and the Ignatius Jones and Allison Moyet hit &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; and charted a hit as a performer with &quot;Steady&quot; in 1985.

== Life and early career ==
Shear was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. He attended the University of Pittsburgh. He distinguished himself with the Pitt Glee Club where he led a special side ensemble called Wooden Music, which used acoustic instruments, in a foreshadowing of his &quot;Unplugged&quot; concept. One of his noted songs of the time, which he performed in concerts with the glee club, was &quot;Always in the Morning&quot;. He left Pitt after three years in 1973, and headed to Los Angeles to pursue a music career.

Shear is married to singer-songwriter Pal Shazar.

== Career ==
Shear has recorded more than 20 albums to date. He made his first appearance on vinyl with Funky Kings (along with two other songwriters, Jack Tempchin and Richard Stekol). After their second album was rejected by the record label (Arista), he formed a new band, the critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) pop group, Jules and the Polar Bears. This band, with Shear writing and singing all songs, released two albums (&quot;Got No Breeding&quot; and &quot;fəˈnet̬·ɪks&quot;) on Columbia, merging a tight rock sound with the emerging synth-pop of the early 1980s. Their third album was rejected by their record label but released as &quot;Bad For Business&quot; in 1996, long after the band had broken up. With Jules and the Polar Bears finished, Shear bounced back with several solo albums. The first, &quot;Watch Dog&quot;, was produced by Todd Rundgren, and featured such players as Tony Levin on bass and Elliot Easton of The Cars on lead guitar. During the sessions, Shear and Easton struck up a friendship, based on their shared musical tastes, which led to various collaborations later on. The album featured the original version of &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, which Cyndi Lauper eventually turned into a top-five hit. The album&#x27;s opening number, &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot;, reached  18 in the UK Singles Chart when Alison Moyet recorded her version of it; Moyet also performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Shear then released an EP, &quot;Jules&quot;, which contained selections from &quot;Watch Dog&quot; on one side, and two mixes of a club-style dance number, &quot;When Love Surges&quot;, on the other side. Shear&#x27;s next full-length album, &quot;The Eternal Return&quot;, was a highly polished, synthesizer-heavy effort, produced by Bill Drescher (of Rick Springfield fame). The album opened with &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, which The Bangles made into a hit. It also featured what would prove to be Shear&#x27;s only hit single under his own name, &quot;Steady&quot; which he wrote in collaboration with Cyndi Lauper. The single reached No. 48 in the U.S.

Shear went on to form two more bands, Reckless Sleepers and Raisins in the Sun. He also conceived (and hosted the first 13 episodes of) the MTV series &quot;Unplugged&quot;. His songs have been more commercially successful in the hands of other artists, notably Cyndi Lauper, whose recording of &quot;All Through the Night&quot; reached number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1984, and The Bangles, whose recording of &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot; reached number 29 in 1986. In 1988, singer-songwriter Iain Matthews (still using the spelling &quot;Ian&quot; for his first name at the time) recorded an album of Shear&#x27;s material, &quot;Walking A Changing Line: The Songs of Jules Shear&quot;, with synthesizer-dominated arrangements. Some of these Shear penned songs were previously unreleased. Matthews previously recorded Jules Shear songs on other albums.

Shear was the subject of a song by &#x27;Til Tuesday, &quot;J for Jules&quot;, after the end of his relationship with that band&#x27;s singer, Aimee Mann. Shear co-wrote the title track of that album, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot;, with Matthew Sweet, and collaborated with Mann on the album&#x27;s leading single, &quot;(Believed You Were) Lucky&quot;, which reached No. 30 on the Modern Rock Tracks and No. 95 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Shear described his &quot;Sayin&#x27; Hello to the Folks&quot; as a &quot;mix tape&quot; of his favorite songs. &quot;I felt like recording songs that I like a lot that I didn&#x27;t write,&quot; he told &quot;Paste&quot;&#x27;s Eliot Wilder in 2004. &quot;I thought it would be good to record songs that didn&#x27;t have a life but should&#x27;ve had a life. This is my attempt at giving them a life.&quot; He and Stewart Lerman, the album&#x27;s producer, selected 12 songs from an original list of 60. These included covers of Todd Rundgren (&quot;Be Nice to Me&quot;), James Brown (&quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Groove&quot;), Bob Dylan (&quot;In the Summertime&quot;) The Dave Clark Five (&quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Have a Reason&quot;) and Brian Wilson (&quot;Guess I&#x27;m Dumb&quot;).

In January 2013, Jules and his wife, artist/songwriter Pal Shazar, released &quot;Shear Shazar.&quot; Produced by Julie Last, this is the first time Jules and Pal have made a full album together, though the two had recorded duets on Shear&#x27;s albums before, such as &quot;Here S/He Comes&quot; on &quot;The Eternal Return&quot; and &quot;Dreams Dissolve in Tears&quot; on &quot;The Great Puzzle&quot;. This was followed later in the year by another Shear solo album, &quot;Longer to Get to Yesterday.&quot; In 2014 Shear Shazar followed up on their debut with the five cut EP &quot;Mess You Up&quot;.

== Chart singles written by Shear ==
The following is a list of Jules Shear compositions that have been chart hits.
== About the albums ==

* Shear&#x27;s first band, Funky Kings, also featured songwriter Jack Tempchin, and their self-titled debut contains the original version of Tempchin&#x27;s song &quot;Slow Dancing&quot;, which was a top 10 hit for Johnny Rivers. &quot;Slow Dancing&quot; and Shear&#x27;s &quot;So Easy to Begin&quot; were both recorded by Olivia Newton-John on her 1977 album &quot;Making a Good Thing Better&quot;. &quot;So Easy to Begin&quot; was also covered by Art Garfunkel. As of this writing, &quot;Funky Kings&quot; has never seen domestic release on CD, and a second album recorded by them remains unreleased in any form.
* Jules and the Polar Bears released &quot;Got No Breeding&quot; in 1978 and &quot;fənĕtĭks&quot; in 1979. (The title of the second album is the phonetic spelling of &quot;phonetics&quot;, and its lyric sheet and credits were printed phonetically). While the first album appeared on CD in the late 1980s, the second was not released on CD until 2006. The CD release of &quot;fənĕtĭks&quot; includes the contents of the 1980 &quot;Economy Package&quot; EP. A third album, &quot;Bad for Business&quot;, was rejected by their label, Columbia, leading to the band&#x27;s breakup. &quot;Bad for Business&quot; was finally released on CD in 1995.
* Shear&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Watch Dog&quot;, was produced by Todd Rundgren and featured Elliot Easton of The Cars on lead guitar, as well as prolific studio bassist Tony Levin, and former Polar Bear Stephen Hague. In addition to featuring &quot;All Through The Night&quot;, later a hit for Cyndi Lauper, the album opens with &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot;, which was later a U.K. chart hit for Alison Moyet. Easton and Shear later collaborates on Easton&#x27;s 1985 solo album, &quot;Change No Change&quot;.
* The &quot;Jules&quot; EP contains selections from &quot;Watch Dog&quot;, plus two mixes of a dance number, &quot;When Love Surges&quot;.
* &quot;The Eternal Return&quot; opens with &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, originally written in the first-person narrative (a cover version by The Bangles is sung in the third-person narrative, rendering the singer an outside observer). &quot;Steady&quot;, co-written with Cyndi Lauper, was released as a single, complete with a video for MTV, and charted at No. 57. &quot;Here S/He Comes&quot; is a duet with Shear&#x27;s wife, Pal Shazar.
* &quot;Demo-Itis&quot; is a collection of home and studio demos. Most of the songs had been previously unreleased, though demos of &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, &quot;If She Knew What She Wants&quot;, and other previous album tracks also appear.
* Shear formed a band called Reckless Sleepers with guitarist Jimmy Vivino (later of The Max Weinberg 7 and Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Basic Cable Band), drummer Steve Holley (formerly of Wings), and bassist Brian Stanley. Their album, &quot;Big Boss Sounds!&quot;, was meant as a collaborative project. However, its only notable success, &quot;If We Never Meet Again&quot;, was the one track on the album written by Shear alone. The edited single version received minor airplay, and the song was covered, first by Tommy Conwell &amp; The Young Rumblers, and later by Roger McGuinn of The Byrds.
* The songs on &quot;The Third Party&quot; consist entirely of one acoustic guitar track, played by Marty Willson-Piper of The Church, and one vocal track by Shear. The lyric sheet included the chords to each song. &quot;The Once Lost Returns&quot; was co-written with Elliot Easton.
* &quot;Horse of a Different Color&quot; is a compilation of Shear&#x27;s band and solo work. It includes &quot;Nothing Was Exchanged&quot;, the opening track from &quot;Funky Kings&quot;—as yet the only track from that album released on CD.
* &quot;The Great Puzzle&quot; includes another duet with Pal Shazar, &quot;Dreams Dissolve in Tears&quot;. The closing number, &quot;Bark&quot;, prominently features Shear&#x27;s unique style of playing guitar in an open tuning with his thumb (described later in this article). 
* &quot;Unplug This&quot; was included as a bonus CD with early releases of &quot;The Great Puzzle&quot;. It contains eight acoustic arrangements of his more well-known songs. The title is a reference to the show &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which Shear had hosted for its first several episodes.
* &quot;The Trap Door&quot; EP contains &quot;The Trap Door&quot;, lead-off track from &quot;The Great Puzzle&quot;, along with three previously unreleased tracks from the &quot;Great Puzzle&quot; sessions: &quot;His Audience Has Gone To Sleep&quot;, &quot;She Makes Things Happen&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Is Left Behind&quot;.
* &quot;Healing Bones&quot; includes Shear&#x27;s first release of a cover, &quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine Any More&quot; (originally a hit for The Walker Brothers). It also includes a song written with Rick Danko of The Band, &quot;Never Again Or Forever&quot;. Elliot Easton played lead guitar on all tracks. The album was co-produced (with Peter Van Hooke) by Rod Argent (of Argent and The Zombies), who performed on all tracks along with Tony Levin, Jerry Marotta, and Easton.
* &quot;Between Us&quot; is a collection of original duets, featuring singers Paula Cole, Rosanne Cash, Carole King, Margo Timmins, Susan Cowsill, Angie Hart of Frente, and Shear&#x27;s brother Rob, among others. &quot;Between Us&quot; also includes Shear&#x27;s first released instrumental, &quot;Entre Nous&quot; (the French equivalent of the album title), in which Shear&#x27;s guitar work interacts with Rob Wasserman&#x27;s distinctive fretless bass stylings. Wasserman is perhaps best known for his own album of duets.
* &quot;Allow Me&quot; is a full-band project of original material. Shear wrote the album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Too Soon Gone&quot;, with Stan Szelest of The Band, who recorded their own version on their album &quot;Jericho&quot;. Shear sang backing vocals on The Band&#x27;s version.
* &quot;Saying Hello to the Folks&quot; is composed entirely of covers, including songs by The Dave Clark Five, Bob Dylan, Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson, and others. 
* &quot;Raisins in the Sun&quot; was a one-off collaboration with Harvey Brooks, Paul Q. Kolderie, Jim Dickinson, Chuck Prophet, Sean Slade, and Winston Watson, recorded in May 1999 and released by Rounder Records two years later.
* &quot;Dreams Don&#x27;t Count&quot; was released on the student record label MAD Dragon Records through Drexel University. Produced by Jules and long-time friend Stewart Lerman, this album is full of melodic acoustic tracks, and features accordion and cello in its arrangements.
* For his next solo album, &quot;More&quot;, Shear began billing himself as Jules Mark Shear, as seen in the CD&#x27;s title and credits. He is also credited with playing lead guitar for the first time on a major release (as opposed to his home recordings on &quot;Demo-itis&quot;). The album was released on his own label, Funzalo Records.
* Shear was a collaborator on Elliot Easton&#x27;s 1985 solo album &quot;Change No Change&quot;, co-writing all songs and singing background vocals. In the liner notes to the CD release, both Easton and Shear cite the closing ballad, &quot;Wide Awake&quot;, as their favorite track from the album.

== Guitar technique ==
Shear&#x27;s unique guitar style derives from tuning the guitar to an open G, but with an E in the bass, equivalent to an E minor seventh chord. The guitar is not strung left-hand style (with the strings installed in reverse order), but is held upside down, with the fretting hand&#x27;s thumb wrapped down over the upper edge of the neck, barring across the strings, and the low E being at the thumb&#x27;s tip.

<doc id="975719" wikidata="Q930117" url="?curid=975719" title="Joe Flaherty">
<text>Joseph Flaherty (born Joseph O&#x27;Flaherty, June 21, 1941 – April 1, 2024) was an American actor, writer, and comedian. He is best known for his work on the Canadian sketch comedy &quot;SCTV&quot; from 1976 to 1984 (on which he also served as a writer), his role as Harold Weir on &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; (1999), and as the heckler in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996).

==Early life and career==
Joseph O&#x27;Flaherty was born on June 21, 1941, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the eldest of seven children. His father was a production clerk at Westinghouse Electric and of Irish heritage and his mother was of Italian descent.

Flaherty served in the United States Air Force for four years, before becoming involved in dramatic theatre.

Flaherty moved to Chicago, where he started his comedy career in 1969 with the Second City Theater as Joe O&#x27;Flaherty and would work with future stars such as John Belushi and Harold Ramis. He dropped the &quot;O&quot; in his birth name as there was another Joseph O&#x27;Flaherty registered with Actors Equity. Along with several other Second City performers, he began appearing on the &quot;National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; from 1973 to 1974. After seven years in Chicago, he moved to Toronto to help establish the Toronto Second City theatre troupe. During those years, he was one of the original writer/performers on &quot;SCTV&quot;, where he spent eight years on the show, playing such characters as Big Jim McBob (of &quot;Farm Film Report&quot; fame), Count Floyd/Floyd Robertson, and station owner/manager Guy Caballero, who goes around in a wheelchair only for respect and undeserved sympathy.

&quot;SCTV&quot; ceased production in 1984. The same year, Flaherty played Count Floyd in a short film that was shown at concerts by the rock band Rush before the song &quot;The Weapon&quot;, for their tour in support of &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (and can be seen in the home video, &quot;Grace Under Pressure Tour&quot;).

In 1988, Flaherty reprised his Count Floyd character for live-action segments of the animated series &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;, a character created and voiced by another SCTV alum, Martin Short.

Flaherty appeared in a number of cult-favorite films, including an appearance as a Western Union postal worker who delivers Doc Brown&#x27;s 70-year-old letter to Marty McFly in &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), as well as the crazed fan yelling &quot;jackass!&quot; who secretly works for antagonist Shooter McGavin in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;. In season eight of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Flaherty once again played the Western Union man in &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;.

Flaherty plays a Vatican Messenger in the &quot;Family Guy season 9&quot; episode &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. In 1989, he played a guest role in &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in the season-four episode &quot;Tooth or Consequences&quot;, as a dentist who must repair Al Bundy&#x27;s teeth. From 1990–93, Flaherty starred in The Family Channel series, &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;.

During 1997–1998, Flaherty starred in the television adaptation of &quot;Police Academy&quot; (&quot;Police Academy: The Series&quot;) as Cmdt. Stuart Hefilfinger. The series lasted for only one season. In 1999, Flaherty joined the cast of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, an NBC hour-long dramedy set in the 1980–1981 academic year, in which he played Harold Weir, the &quot;imperfect perfect&quot; father of two teens. Despite a dedicated cult following, the show only lasted one season.

Flaherty made appearances on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; as Father McAndrew, the priest at the Heffernans&#x27; church. He starred on the Bite TV original program, &quot;Uncle Joe&#x27;s Cartoon Playhouse&quot;, and served as a judge on the CBC program &quot;The Second City&#x27;s Next Comedy Legend&quot;.

From 2001 to 2004, he had appeared in various Disney shows and films, including &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

In 2018, Flaherty participated in a SCTV cast reunion at Toronto&#x27;s Elgin Theatre filmed by Martin Scorsese for a yet to be released Netflix special on SCTV.

Beginning in 2004, Flaherty was artist-in-residence at Humber College&#x27;s School of Creative and Performing Arts in Toronto, where he taught a comedy writing course. He previously helped found the school&#x27;s comedy writing and performance program serving as its artistic director. He was also on the program&#x27;s advisory committee.

==Personal life and death==
Flaherty was married to Judith Dagley for 22 years until their divorce in 1996. They had two children, Gudrun, who is also an actress and writer, and Gabriel. His brothers, Paul (b. 1945)
and Dave (1948–2017), were both comedy writers.

Flaherty died on April 1, 2024, at the age of 82, after a short illness.

==Characterizations==
Flaherty impersonated a number of celebrities, including Kirk Douglas, Richard Nixon, Gregory Peck, Alan Alda, Bing Crosby, Gavin McLeod and Elvis Presley.

Flaherty appeared in a cameo in the deleted scenes from &quot;&quot; as the manager of a Texas television station and the boss of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), one of the members of the station&#x27;s news team. He also appeared as an immigration Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer in the &quot;Canadian Road Trip&quot; episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; alongside fellow SCTV member Dave Thomas.

In the third episode of &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, &quot;Tricks and Treats&quot;, he is dressed up as a vampire, a reference to his character Count Floyd.

<text>Bettinus is a lunar impact crater located near the southwest limb. Due to its location, the crater has a distinctly oval shape because of foreshortening. To the south of the rim is the similar-sized crater Kircher, and to the northwest is the slightly smaller Zucchius. From the west to the southwest, closer to the limb, is the giant formation Bailly.

The rim of Bettinus is only somewhat worn, with an inner wall that is wider to the northwest. The interior floor is relatively flat, with a central rise that is offset to the west of the midpoint. There is a small crater along the eastern rim.

Bettinus lies due south of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bettinus.

<doc id="975726" wikidata="Q3535281" url="?curid=975726" title="Azhar Mahmood">
<text>Azhar Mahmood (; born 28 February 1975) is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer. He was the bowling coach of the Pakistani national cricket team from 2016 to 2019. He was a part of the Pakistan squad which finished as runners-up at the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

Previously, he played Tests and ODIs for Pakistan national cricket team and county cricket in England. Azhar is a dual British citizen.

== Personal life==
Azhar Mahmood&#x27;s wedding ceremony was held in 2003.

==Domestic career==
As a teenager, Azhar was mentored by Irfan Bhatti who played a One Day International for Pakistan in the early 1990s. Originally his father objected to his interest in cricket, but later started to appreciate it seeing his accomplishments. When not doing net practice, Azhar would fancy himself playing tape ball cricket on the cemented pitch in the cricket ground in front of his home.

He played county cricket for Surrey and in November 2007 signed a two-year deal to play for Kent.

Azhar became a British citizen in 2011. This allowed him to play for Kent as an English-qualified player, further distancing himself from a recall to the Pakistan side.

It was announced that Azhar would be playing for the Auckland Aces as one of their overseas professionals in the 2011/12 season. In the 2012 IPL auction, Mahmood was sold to Kings XI Punjab for $200,000, double his base price of $100,000. In 2015, he was signed by KKR as replacement for James Neesham and played a few matches but was dropped from the squad the very next season.

He along with Isuru Udana set the highest 8th wicket partnership in all forms of T20s (120) during the inaugural SLPL league in 2012.

==International career==
===Early days===
Azhar made his One-Day International debut against India in 1996 at Toronto Cricket Club, Toronto, but did not gain major recognition until his Test debut against South Africa the following year at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi when he hit a century and a half-century without being dismissed. He later went on to score two more centuries against the South Africans.

He joined the Pakistani team primarily as a medium pacer but he has surprised many by his batting powers. His hard hitting but orthodox batting skills have also been extremely useful in the one-day game. Unlike most Pakistani pacers who are swing bowlers, he is a useful English-style seam bowler, who can chip in with wickets in time of need.

In 2000, Lt-General Tauqir Zia, then the PCB chairman, said that the board would choose the next captain – not based on seniority alone – and if people find the choice unacceptable they will not be selected. Later – in front of some senior players – he told Azhar Mahmood that he will be the next Pakistan captain. Together they would plan the future strategy. But this never came to pass.

===Comeback===

He was recalled to the national side for the ODI series against South Africa in early 2007, but subsequently dropped when the 2007 Cricket World Cup team was announced. He was however recalled to go with the squad to the West Indies after a knee injury to Abdul Razzaq. It was Mahmood&#x27;s 3rd World Cup.

However, aside from playing in a practice match, Azhar did not get a chance to participate in the World Cup and Pakistan&#x27;s early exit from the tournament meant that he was once again, in line for being axed from the national squad. Following his exclusion, Azhar returned to playing county cricket in UK. Over the years, due to his constant exclusion from the Pakistani squad and the fact that he has crossed the 30-year-old mark, it seems that Mahmood is not as interested in returning to the Pakistani line up as he once was. His weight gain, mediocre performances in ODIs, combined with the tough competition for the all rounder slot in the Pakistani line up meant that his chances for making a return to the national squad were very limited. He has previously signed with the defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) and had been released from his central contract.

===Trivia===
&quot;Wisden&quot; in 2001 included Azhar Mahmood&#x27;s innings of 132 for Pakistan against South Africa at Kingsmead Cricket Ground, Durban in 1997–98 as the 8th best Test Innings of All Time in its list of Wisden 100. It mentioned – &quot;South Africa&#x27;s pace attack had more depth than at any other time in their history: Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock supported by Fanie de Villiers and Lance Klusener. No surprise that Pakistan were put in to bat on a treacherous pitch – or that they should be reduced to 89 for 5. Salvation came in the form of a 22-year-old allrounder who seemed to be batting too low at No.7: his century was already his third in six Test innings against South Africa. Tucking into a great pace bowler like Donald, he scored 96 runs in boundaries while proving himself an expert shepherd of a tail: he made 90% of Pakistan&#x27;s last 106 runs. They went on to win a low-scoring match by 29.&quot;

==Coaching career==
In November 2016, Mahmood was appointed bowling coach of the Pakistan side. Earlier the same year, he had served two short stints in a similar capacity, also for the national team. He left the role in August 2019 when his contract was not extended.

Mahmood also served as the bowling coach of two PSL Franchises Karachi Kings &amp; Multan Sultans.

On 3 December 2021, Mahmood has appointed by Islamabad United as the head coach for their 7th season of PSL. Ahead of the 2024 season, Mahmood left his role as head coach and was appointed Islamabad&#x27;s bowling coach. On 9 April 2024, Mahmood was appointed Pakistan&#x27;s head coach for their series against New Zealand.

<text>Alexander William Kinglake (5 August 1809 – 2 January 1891) was an English orientalist travel writer and historian.

He was born near Taunton, Somerset, and educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was called to the Bar in 1837, and built up a thriving legal practice, which, in 1856, he abandoned to devote himself to literature and public life.

His first literary venture was &quot;Eothen; or Traces of travel brought home from the East&quot; (London: J. Ollivier, 1844), a very popular work of Eastern travel, apparently first published anonymously, in which he described a journey he made about ten years earlier in Syria, Palestine and Egypt, together with his Eton contemporary Lord Pollington. Elliot Warburton said it evoked &quot;the East itself in vital actual reality&quot; and it was instantly successful. However, his &quot;magnum opus&quot; was &quot;The Invasion of Crimea: Its Origin, and an Account of its Progress down to the Death of Lord Raglan&quot;, in 8 volumes, published from 1863 to 1887 by Blackwood, Edinburgh, one of the most effective works of its class. The History, which Geoffrey Bocca describes as a book &quot;by which no intelligent man can fail immediately to be fascinated, no matter to what page he might open it&quot; has been accused of being too favourable to Lord Raglan and unduly hostile to Napoleon III for whom the author had an extreme aversion.

The town of Kinglake in Victoria, Australia, and the adjacent national park are named after him.

A Whig, Kinglake was elected at the 1857 general election as one of the two Members of Parliament (MP) for Bridgwater, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1852. He was returned at the next two general elections, but the result of the 1868 general election in Bridgwater was voided on petition on 26 February 1869. No by-election was held, and after a Royal Commission found that there had been extensive corruption, the town was disenfranchised in 1870.

In the late 1880s he developed cancer of the throat, and he died on 2 January 1891.

<text>Freddie Joseph Patek (; born October 9, 1944), nicknamed &quot;the Flea&quot; or &quot;the Cricket&quot;, is an American former professional baseball shortstop who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Kansas City Royals and California Angels. At tall, he was the shortest MLB player of his time.

==Career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Patek was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 22nd round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft out of Seguin High School in Seguin, Texas. He made his major league debut on June 3, 1968, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at shortstop, and played all but six of his 292 games with the Pirates at shortstop. However, with All-Star Gene Alley firmly entrenched at shortstop there was a desire on the part of management to convert him into a utility player.

===Kansas City Royals===
Patek was traded along with Bruce Dal Canton and Jerry May from the Pirates to the Royals for Jackie Hernández, Bob Johnson and Jim Campanis at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1970. In his first season with the Royals, Patek hit for the cycle on July 9, 1971, and led the American League with 11 triples to finish sixth in A.L. M.V.P. balloting. He earned his first of three All-Star selections the following season, and was a staple of the Royals line-up that won the American League West from 1976 through 1978. He led the American League with 53 stolen bases in 1977. For 8 consecutive years, Patek posted 30 or more stolen bases and he led the American league in double plays turned 4 straight years. A memorable image was captured by NBC television of Patek sitting painfully alone in the Royals&#x27; empty dugout while the New York Yankees celebrated on-field their come-from-behind victory to win the last game of the 1977 American League Championship Series, played in Kansas City on Patek&#x27;s 33rd birthday. The game and series ended when Patek grounded into a double play. He was the starting shortstop for the American League in the 1978 All-Star Game.

A durable player at shortstop, he ranks among the Royals all-time leaders in hits (1,076), walks (413), runs scored (571), stolen bases (336), and games played (1,245).

===California Angels===
Following the 1979 season, Patek signed as a free agent with the California Angels. He became the second shortstop, after Ernie Banks, to hit three home runs in a single game on June 20, 1980, against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. In 1981, Patek was relegated to a utility role, actually seeing more playing time backing up Bobby Grich at second base than he did at short.

Patek retired after the 1981 season with a career batting average of .242 with 41 home runs and 490 runs batted in.

Patek was better known for his speed and his defensive abilities; former manager Whitey Herzog called Patek the best artificial turf shortstop he ever managed, ranking him even higher than Ozzie Smith. When asked by a reporter what it felt like to be the smallest player in the major leagues, Patek replied, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be the smallest player in the majors than the tallest player in the minors.&quot; Although Patek played in four American League Championship Series, his teams never reached the World Series. The Pirates won the World Series the season after Patek left the Pirates (), and the Royals lost the World Series the season after Patek left the Royals (). Baseball analyst Bill James has ranked Patek, a member of the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame, the 14th best player in Royals&#x27; history.

==Personal life==
Patek briefly served as a part-time baseball analyst for NBC after his retirement. He was a color commentator for Texas Rangers games on television in 1985.

On July 21, 1992, Patek&#x27;s daughter Kimberlie was paralyzed from the neck down in a car accident. Community fund raisers and charity events, and a donation from the Baseball Assistance Team, helped the family defray significant medical expenses. Kimberlie died on June 14, 1995.

<doc id="975752" wikidata="Q7755160" url="?curid=975752" title="The Ontarion">
<text>The Ontarion is an independent English-language student newspaper published at the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario. It publishes each month with over 10,000 copies distributed on and off campus during the fall and winter semester and, until the summer of 2017, it published bi-weekly during the summer semester. It has since ceased summer publication, while it continues regular publications throughout the traditional school year.

==History==
The newspaper&#x27;s first edition was published on March 29, 1951. The paper served the students of the Ontario Agricultural College before the University of Guelph&#x27;s amalgamation in 1964.

The newspaper was intended to serve students at all three founding colleges. One early editor reported that the paper&#x27;s name came from the idea that the three schools might one day become the University of Ontario.

Over the years the newspaper has changed reflecting the growth on campus and changes in society, as well as the individuality of each new editor and various staff.

The social club atmosphere of the 1950s lead to Ontarion editors in the 1960s to &#x27;stir up controversy&#x27; with articles about communism and boarding houses that advertised &quot;whites preferred.&quot; One issue in fall 1970 was confiscated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the printing plant because it contained a bulletin with the FLQ manifesto which was illegal under the War Measures Act.

In the 1980s to present day, editors have varied the focus from news and intellectual discussion to letters and opinion pieces in an effort to hear all voices on campus. One of the editors in the 1990s told students: &quot;If you don&#x27;t like what we&#x27;re doing with the paper, you can volunteer to help change it...It&#x27;s your paper.&quot;

The newspaper celebrated 50 years of publishing in 2001 and is still one of the few completely autonomous student newspapers in Canada.

==Structure==

The Ontarion is a student newspaper at a university without a journalism program. It depends on volunteer submissions and has been driven by citizen journalism since long before the term was coined. Undergraduate students need no experience to join and getting involved is only a matter of contacting a member of the newspaper&#x27;s staff. This is often done at Thursday volunteer meetings. The Thursday volunteer meeting is an Ontarion tradition where volunteers come out, eat pizza, listen to the editors talk about the stories they&#x27;re looking to have written that week and socialize.

The Ontarion&#x27;s staff is made up of two departments. The business department includes the ad designer, ad manager, office manager and business manager. The editorial staff is made up of a copy editor, layout director, photo &amp; graphics editor, news editor, sports editor and arts &amp; culture editor. The editorial staff reports to the editor in chief, who reports to the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors are members of the corporation who have been voted onto the board. They meet once per month to manage the behind the scenes work that keeps the Ontarion going: human resources, policy, public relations and finances.

The organization is a non-profit corporation.

<text>Robert Hart (1814 – 16 September 1894) was a 19th-century New Zealand politician.

==Biography==

Hart was also baptised on 4 April 1815. He and his brother George left London in April 1843 on board the &quot;Mary&quot;, arriving in Wellington on 9 August 1843.

He was a well-known solicitor and barrister in Wellington, first with the firm Messrs. Holroyd and Hart, then for many years as the principal member of the firm Messrs Hart and Buckley.

He was elected in 1853 to the 1st New Zealand Parliament, representing the City of Wellington electorate, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. In the 1855 general election, five people contested the City of Wellington electorate. Whilst the results were close, Hart came last and was not returned. He contested 27 December 1856 by-election against Samuel Revans in the Hutt electorate and gained 24 votes against 96 for Revans.

In 1859, he was appointed Judge of the District Courts of Wellington, Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Wanganui. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 9 July 1872, and remained a member until his death in 1894.

He married Catherine McLean on 10 January 1867 at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Wellington. Catherine was the sister of Donald McLean, the Superintendent of Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province. His brother was the politician George Hart.

<text>Henry Kingsley (2 January 1830 – 24 May 1876) was an English novelist, brother of the better-known Charles Kingsley. He was an early exponent of muscular Christianity in his 1859 novel &quot;The Recollections of Geoffry Hamlyn&quot;.

==Life==
Kingsley was born at Barnack Rectory, Northamptonshire, the son of the Rev. Charles Kingsley the elder and Mary, &quot;née&quot; Lucas. 
Charles Kingsley came of a long line of clergymen and soldiers. There were several writers in the family besides Henry and Charles, including Mary Kingsley, an explorer and writer, Charlotte Kingsley Chanter, a botanical writer and novelist, and George Kingsley, a traveller and writer.

Henry Kingsley&#x27;s boyhood was spent at Clovelly and Chelsea, before attending King&#x27;s College School, King&#x27;s College London, and Worcester College, Oxford, which he left without graduating.
An opportune legacy from a relation enabled him to leave Oxford free of debt and emigrate to Australia. He arrived in Melbourne in the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; in December 1853 with Henry Venables. He became involved in gold-digging, and later joined the mounted police.

For some time Kingsley had little or no money and carried his swag from station to station. Philip Russell stated in 1887 that he employed Kingsley at his station Langa-Willi, and that &quot;Geoffry Hamlyn&quot; (1859) was begun there. Miss Rose Browne, daughter of &quot;Rolf Boldrewood&quot;, stated it was on her father&#x27;s suggestion that Kingsley began to write. Russell&#x27;s story is confirmed by her further statement that her father gave Kingsley a letter to Mr Mitchell of Langa-Willi, that he stayed with Mitchell, and there wrote &quot;Geoffry Hamlyn&quot;.
On his return to the UK in 1857, Kingsley devoted himself to literature, and wrote several well-regarded novels, including &quot;Geoffry Hamlyn&quot;, set in Colebrooke, Devon, and Australia, which the late 19th-century English author George Gissing called &quot;unliterary stuff&quot;, &quot;The Hillyars and the Burtons&quot; (1865), &quot;Ravenshoe&quot; (1861) and &quot;Austin Elliot&quot; (1863). &quot;Ravenshoe&quot; is generally seen as the best. Henry Kingsley married Sarah Maria Haselwood on 19 July 1864. In 1869, he moved to Edinburgh to edit the &quot;Daily Review&quot;, but soon gave this up and in 1870 became war correspondent for the paper in the Franco-German War.

Kingsley also published &quot;Leighton Court&quot; (1866), &quot;Mademoiselle Mathilde&quot; (1868), &quot;Tales of Old Travel Re-narrated&quot; (1869), &quot;Stretton&quot; (1869), &quot;The Boy in Grey&quot; (1871), &quot;Hetty and other Stories&quot; (1871), &quot;Old Margaret&quot; (1871), &quot;Hornby Mills and other Stories&quot; (1872), &quot;Valentine&quot; (1872), &quot;The Harveys&quot; (1872), &quot;Oakshott Castle&quot; (1873), &quot;Reginald Hetherege&quot; (1874), &quot;Number Seventeen&quot; (1875), &quot;The Grange Garden&quot; (1876), &quot;Fireside Studies&quot; (Essays) (1876), and &quot;The Mystery of the Island&quot; (1877).

Kingsley and his wife moved to Cuckfield, Sussex late in 1874, where Kingsley died of cancer of the tongue on 24 May 1876. Kingsley House at King&#x27;s College School is named after him.

<text>Simon Patrick O&#x27;Donnell (born 26 January 1963) is an Australian former cricketer, VFL footballer, and horse racing and cricket commentator. He is currently a horse breeder and enabler. He is a former record holder for the fastest One Day International half-century. He was educated at Deniliquin High School and Assumption College. O&#x27;Donnell was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup.

==Cricket==
O&#x27;Donnell played as an all-rounder for Victoria in the Sheffield Shield between 1984 and 1993, scoring a century in his first match. He went on to play 6 Test matches in 1985, 5 on the Ashes tour of England and one at home, but with a low bowling strike rate in 5 and 4 day cricket, he was more successful in the shorter form of the game.

Seen as a limited-overs specialist with clever medium pace bowling and explosive lower order hitting, he played 87 ODIs between 1985 and 1992, scoring 1242 runs and taking 108 wickets in his career. He played in Australia&#x27;s 1987 World Cup Final victory and was a significant wicket-taker and finished the World cup as Australia&#x27;s most economical bowler, but soon after he suffered severe pain that was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

He recovered with treatment to return to the Australian One-Day team in the 1988–89 season and played 43 more limited-overs matches till 10 December 1991 and claimed 56 wickets and made 5 match winning 50 plus scores including the fastest half-century in One Day Internationals (18 balls v Sri Lanka, Sharjah, 1990, which lasted for 6 years until Sri Lankan Sanath Jayasuriya scored 50 from 17 balls v Pakistan at Singapore on 7 April 1996). O&#x27;Donnell maintained a very good batting strike rate of 80.96 runs per 100 balls in ODIs, almost double his scoring rate in Tests.

He was captain of Victoria for five seasons from 1988–89 until his retirement in 1993. This was a mixed period, which included a Sheffield Shield victory in 90–91, but Victoria also finished last in 1988–89, 1989–90 and 1992–93.

O&#x27;Donnell was voted international cricketer of the year in 1990–91.

==Australian rules football==
As a junior, Simon played Australian rules football for Assumption College, Kilmore, where he kicked 100 goals in his senior year. This led to him being recruited for senior football by the St Kilda Football Club, where his father Kevin had played 49 games on a forward flank in the 1940s. Coincidentally, Kevin O&#x27;Donnell played alongside two more notable Australian cricketers; Sam Loxton and Keith Miller, members of the 1948 Invincibles.

O&#x27;Donnell played 24 games and kicked 18 goals between 1982 and 1983 in what was then the VFL. However, he had continued to play cricket and retired from football to focus on his cricket career.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s son James made his AFL debut for Western Bulldogs playing against Carlton on 13 May 2023.

==Media career==

O&#x27;Donnell hosted Melbourne radio station Sport 927&#x27;s morning program with Kevin Bartlett until 2004.

With the Nine Network, O&#x27;Donnell has been a commentator of cricket and now presents &quot;The Cricket Show&quot;. Having owned and managed race horses through his company, O&#x27;Donnell Thoroughbreds International, he is also used as an expert on horseracing on Nine&#x27;s racing coverage.

During the mid-1990s as part of his work with Channel 9, O&#x27;Donnell was a regular on the daytime program &quot;The Midday Show&quot;, teaming up with former rugby league footballer Paul &quot;Fatty&quot; Vautin on Fridays to give an overview of the weekends sporting events, usually the AFL and NSWRL competitions, and to give their racing tips. The pair would generally get into silly situations (e.g. coming out onto the set dressed in blowup Sumo suits), or would be on location such as in early 1994 when O&#x27;Donnell was taken on some hot laps of the high speed Calder Park Thunderdome oval racetrack in Melbourne with multiple AUSCAR champion Brad Jones.

In November 2011, it was announced that O&#x27;Donnell would replace James Brayshaw as host of &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot;. However, in November 2012, Nine announced that O&#x27;Donnell had left the network.

==Cricket career==
===1983–84 Season===
O&#x27;Donnell made his first class debut for Victoria against South Australia at the MCG in February 1984.

===1984–85===
The following summer his bowling gathered attention when he took the wickets of Kepler Wessels and Allan Border in Sheffield Shield game against Queensland, as well as making 54.

An innings of 45 not out helped steer Victoria to victory in a McDonald&#x27;s Cup game. He made 78 in a run-heavy game against the touring West Indies and hit 42 off 43 balls and 129 against Western Australia.

He was selected in the Prime Ministers XI to play the West Indies. According to a contemporary report, &quot;O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s selection is a timely one as his name has been cropping up regularly in discussions on Australian teams and it will be no surprise if he is selected to play in the one-day series in the New Year. As well as being a more than useful medium-pace bowler O&#x27;Donnell has the potential to be a leading batsman, having scored a hard-hitting century against Western Australia in Perth last week.&quot;

In January 1985 O&#x27;Donnell was named in the 12 man Australian one day squad. &quot;&quot;I am very delighted&quot;, he said. &quot;It will be the biggest thrill of my life to walk out on to the MCG on Sunday. It was my goal at the start of the year to try and make national selection, but I thought that might not come for two or three years.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s one day debut was a successful one, taking 1–39 and scoring 20 not out against Sri Lanka. He scored 25 in a defeat against the West Indies.

In the Prime Ministers XI game he took two wickets but dropped two catches. Kept on in the one day team he took two wickets against Sri Lanka then scored some useful runs in a rare Australian victory over the West Indies.

In the World Championship of Cricket, O&#x27;Donnell had a fantastic game against Pakistan, making 74 and taking 2–42. This helped earn O&#x27;Donnell selection on the short tour to Sharjah in early 1985. He was also selected on the squad to tour England for the Ashes. &quot;A lot of hard work has been one thing&quot;, he said. &quot;The dividends are starting to pay off – they&#x27;re paying off very quickly&quot;, adding that &quot;I&#x27;ve still got to get a Test match over there. There are 17 going, so I&#x27;ve got to get into the top 11.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell had only played seven first-class matches, hitting 528 runs at an average of 66, with two centuries, and had taken 15 wickets at an average of 38.23. He was still listed in the St Kilda squad.

===1985 Ashes===
O&#x27;Donnell leapt into test contention with a score of 100 against the MCC. &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s the greatest innings I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell said, &quot;and walking off the ground to an ovation like that was one of my greatest thrills. I&#x27;m absolutely ecstatic.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell played in the Australian team for the one day internationals, taking two crucial wickets in the second.

He was picked in Australian side for the first test, as the fourth bowler. He scored 24 and took 3 wickets in England&#x27;s second innings. England won the game easily.

O&#x27;Donnell kept his place in the side for the second test. He proved his usefulness with the bat, helping Australia navigate a tricky second innings run chase and hitting the winning runs with a six.

There was a risk he would be made 12th man for the third test but O&#x27;Donnell kept his position. He was made 12th man for the last test.

===1985–86===
O&#x27;Donnell injured his hip at the beginning of the 1985–86 season and missed some early games. He recovered in time to be selected for the first test against New Zealand. He took a career best 2–53 and 5–66 against New South Wales. However fellow all rounder Greg Matthews took 5–22 in the same game and he was preferred to O&#x27;Donnell, who was made 12th man.

O&#x27;Donnell was kept in the squad and played in the second test against New Zealand. He took part in an important second innings partnership which guided Australia to victory. However he was injured during the test while fielding and was omitted from the third test.

He was out of cricket for a number of weeks. He returned against Tasmania taking 3–48.

===1986–87===
O&#x27;Donnell began the 1986–87 season well with 52 against Tasmania and 108 against NSW. He followed this with 77 against England in a tour game and 86 against West Australia.

He was unable to force his way back into the test team but was selected in Australia&#x27;s one day squad. Highlights included 4–65 against the West Indies, 52 against the West Indies, 3–39 against England, a man of the match 4–19 against the West Indies, and a match winning 23 off 15 balls against the West Indies. Allan Border said that O&#x27;Donnell, Dean Jones and Steve Waugh had been Australia&#x27;s stand out players of the series.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s good form continued with 86 against Queensland and 73 against South Australia. He made 80 and 78 against WA in the Sheffield Shield final, but Victoria did not win the game.

O&#x27;Donnell was selected to play in Australia&#x27;s one day tour of Sharjah in 1987 and the World Cup.

===1987 World Cup and Cancer===
Shortly before O&#x27;Donnell left for India he discovered, &quot;a lump on my ribs that was sore. I made some doctors do some horrible things to ensure I got to India. I got an X-ray that showed I was missing a rib. The doctor was worried about it, but I was on a plane to India three days later. But two days into India not only did the big lump come back but he had a couple of partners and that&#x27;s when I thought I was in a bit of strife.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell did not go to the team doctor. &quot;I did nothing. Make no mistake, I&#x27;m no martyr in all of this, in fact, I was motivated by pure selfishness.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s World Cup highlights include 4–39 against Zimbabwe.

&quot;The team was on a campaign and I didn&#x27;t want to jeopardize it so I just tried to keep myself up. I had a few talks with Bob [Simpson] and Bruce [Reid] but I didn&#x27;t tell them what I thought it was. I didn&#x27;t want to worry anyone because we all had a job to do... and we did the job.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell says he told Simpson after Australia won the semi-final in Pakistan. &quot;I knew I was within a week of going home to find out what was wrong and it really frightened me... Before the final at our team meeting I was fined by teammates for not being part of celebrations. That was fine. But I needed to tell someone.&quot;

O&#x27;Donnell went to Warrigal Private Hospital as soon as he got back:
I was operated on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, was sitting on the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... [Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma] John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s—less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what&#x27;s in front of you it gets better. I don&#x27;t want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the &quot;how in the hell did I get it?&quot; moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.
O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s injury was initially reported as a muscle strain.

&quot;If I didn&#x27;t need the operation I could go out and bowl 30 overs now&quot;, he said at the time. &quot;That&#x27;s the good thing about it. I feel as strong as a bull.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell commenced chemotherapy and received the good wishes of Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

Three months later O&#x27;Donnell was declared cancer free.

===1988–89: Victorian Captain===
Simon O&#x27;Donnell was appointed Victorian captain at the beginning of the 1988–89 season. He told the press:
It will be a win-at-all costs approach. We&#x27;re going to go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you&#x27;ll win a lot more games than you lose. I&#x27;ve been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It&#x27;s a big part of the captaincy so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It&#x27;s my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.
O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s highlights for the summer included 6–54 against NSW.

Victoria performed poorly in the Sheffield Shield that summer, ultimately coming last. O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s captaincy was often criticised for being over generous in his declarations. &quot;Our Shield program has gone off the rails a bit because we&#x27;ve let ourselves down badly as a team&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell said. &quot;We&#x27;ve batted well or we&#x27;ve bowled well but we haven&#x27;t combined the two.&quot; However Victoria did make the finals of the one day FAI Cup.

O&#x27;Donnell was selected in the Australian one day team that summer. His first game back was a successful one, taking 1–45 and scoring 46 off 54 balls against Pakistan. He was dropped from the side after the first final.

Through the 1989 English summer, O&#x27;Donnell played club cricket for Haslingden. He played a game for the Rest of the World against Glamorgan and scored 66 off 23 balls.

He played in the Australian one day team that toured India in late 1989, and had a mediocre tournament with the exception of 3–48 against Sri Lanka.

===1989/90===
At the beginning of the 1989–90 summer there was some talk that Dean Jones might captain Victoria instead of O&#x27;Donnell. However O&#x27;Donnell retained the captaincy.

His batting form was better that summer, scoring centuries against the touring Sri Lanka side and Tasmania.

He kept his place in the Australian side for the one day tournament at the end of the summer. He won man of the match against Sri Lanka scoring 57 and taking 4–36. Other highlights of the summer included 3–36 against Sri Lanka.

O&#x27;Donnell toured New Zealand with the one day side, taking 5–13 in a game against New Zealand. He later made 52 in another game.

He also toured with Australia on a trip to Sharjah. In a game against Sri Lanka, O&#x27;Donnell scored 74 off 29 balls, making his 50 in 18 balls – the fastest one day 50 at that time.

===1990–91: International Cricketer of the Year and Sheffield Shield Champions===
O&#x27;Donnell continued to play strongly for the Australian one-day team throughout the 1990–91 summer. Highlights included 4–45 against England, and 71 against England He over took Dennis Lillee as Australia&#x27;s leading ODI wicket-taker and there was talk he might go to the West Indies as a limited over specialist. He was not selected but did win the International Cricketer of the Year Award despite playing no tests. He also led Victoria to the Sheffield Shield when they defeated New South Wales in the final. O&#x27;Donnell said after the match:
It&#x27;s definitely the hardest game of cricket I&#x27;ve ever played. The World Cup was difficult, if not more difficult, but you knew it was all going to be over in a day. This just took turn after turn after turn over the four days&#x27; duration, plus your rained out day – it was a real tough game of cricket to play for every body.
In 1991 he scored 71 off 45 balls in a one-day game for Victoria against Essex.

===1991–92===
O&#x27;Donnell was selected in Australia&#x27;s one day side for 1991–92 but had to withdraw due to a dislocated shoulder. He played for Victoria as a batsman only for a few games. Despite his injury he was named in Australia&#x27;s preliminary 20 man squad for the 1992 World Cup. He suffered a poor run of form, scoring 124 runs at an average of 12 with the bat, and only bowling gently medium pace. He was not picked for the final 14 man World Cup squad.

O&#x27;Donnell responded with a quickfire 87 against South Australia for Victoria. Australia struggled during the World Cup, failing to make the semi-finals, and Allan Border later wondered if omitting O&#x27;Donnell was a mistake.

&quot;It&#x27;s a real shame that he just couldn&#x27;t get it together when the selectors were sitting down&quot;, Border said. &quot;To me he&#x27;s done a fantastic job for us... It was a difficult one, wasn&#x27;t it? His form was ordinary and we weren&#x27;t exactly sure how he was going to come up bowling.&quot;

===1992–93===
O&#x27;Donnell was reappointed Victorian captain for the 1992–93 season. He earned selection in the Prime Ministers XI. Victoria struggled that summer and O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s captaincy came under criticism for lack of imagination and aggression. There was some talk his job was in danger. O&#x27;Donnell:

&quot;I agree where there&#x27;s smoke there&#x27;s fire, and comments like that aren&#x27;t made unless they come from a pretty reliable source. I suppose the next step is to try and find out where they come from and talk to the person that makes them, because if there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s got to be said I&#x27;d prefer it was said to me. That hasn&#x27;t happened as yet, but we&#x27;ll see what happens in the next 24 hours.&quot;

Victorian officials said that O&#x27;Donnell had their support. Victoria did make the final of the domestic one day tournament that year but performed poorly in the Sheffield Shield and O&#x27;Donnell began to seriously reconsider his future.

In July 1993 O&#x27;Donnell resigned as captain of Victoria.

<text>Footvolley ( in Brazil, &quot;Futevólei&quot; in Portugal) (first known as pevoley) is a sport that combines aspects of beach volleyball and association football.

Similar to Kick Volleyball and Futnet.

Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Brazil. Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their hands and a football replaces the volleyball.

==History==
Footvolley was created by Octavio de Moraes in 1965 in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Copacabana Beach. The game of footvolley was first called &#x27;pévolei&#x27;, pé=foot and vôlei=volley, but that name was discarded in favor of &quot;futevôlei&quot;. (Cf. Portuguese &quot;futebol&quot;, &quot;association football&quot;.) Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro, according to one player because football was banned on the beach, but volleyball courts were open. The sport had spread to Recife, Salvador, Brasília, Goiânia, Santos, and Florianópolis by the 1970s.
Teams of footvolley had five aside at first. Due to the skill level of the footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players), the ball would rarely drop. The players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.

In recent years, professional football players have taken up footvolley in both promotional events and celebrity matches. Some notable Brazilian footballers who have played (or still play) footvolley are Romário, Edmundo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho Gaúcho, Júnior, Renato Gaúcho and Edinho (1982 &amp; 1986 National Team).

The first International Footvolley event to occur outside of Brazil was in 2003 by the United States Footvolley Association on Miami Beach at the 2003 Fitness Festival. This event led to international players and teams in pursuit of federation status. A tournament was held during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as a demonstration sport.

== Ball ==
An indoor footvolley ball looks like a basketball, but at only 360g, it is smaller, bouncier and heavier than a volleyball.

==Rules==
Footvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except players are not allowed to use their hands and a football replaces the volleyball.

The field is 4x4 meters long. Points are awarded if the ball hits the ground in the opponent&#x27;s court, if the opponents commit a fault, or if they fail to return the ball over the net. Scoring is done using the rally point system (new volleyball rules). Match scoring is usually up to the event organizer&#x27;s discretion. Generally speaking, matches are one set to 18 points; or best of three sets to 15 points (with the third set to 11 points). The court is 29.5 feet x 59 ft (old beach volleyball). The height of the net varies based on the competition. The Official International Rule for the net height set is for the men&#x27;s competition. For the women&#x27;s competition, the height of the net should be set at .

==International growth==

Since the sport&#x27;s inception in Brazil, footvolley has spread and gained popularity internationally, including in the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania.

Major events have been held at many beach cities in countries around the world, including Spain, Portugal, Israel, Greece, United Arab Emirates, France, the Netherlands, Aruba, Thailand, South Africa, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, and Iran.

===Paraguay===
Paraguay was the first world champion of footvolley. The Paraguayan Jesús is considered the best player in the World Championship.

===Brazil===
Brasília (the capital of Brazil) has produced players like Eduardo Papel, Gabriel, Xeleleu, Jansen de Oliveira, Ramiro, Betola, Edinho, Hugão, and Luisinho who are still today in activity and besides their admired carriers, they also taught other popular young players, including Belo, Marcelinho, Mário, Café, Diego and Lana (in female and unisex footvolley). Also players as renato and felipe.

===United Kingdom===
In April 1997, the England Team accompanied football legends John Barnes and Niall Quinn to a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand organized by the Thai Footvolley Federation.

In 2007 the two events held were the Muller Rice cake Open in Croyde, and the Lamisil Once Footvolley Open in Brighton. Dirceu and Luigi were champions at both events, maintaining their unbeaten record and David and Gary, the England Footvolley Team No. 1 pair won the Shield Competition.

===Israel===

Footvolley was first played in Israel in 2003 when a few beach boys from Gordon Beach, Tel Aviv learned about the exciting game from two Brazilian soccer players who played for Israeli teams. It was in 2007 that Corona in Israel got involved in footvolley, establishing the first footvolley ordinary league already in 2008.

Corona FootVolley League, so far the only ordinary footvolley league in the world, is played since 2008 every summer starting in May/June until the final four in September/October with 12 teams and 11 league rounds in the Premier league and 12 teams playing 11 rounds in the Masters league.

In 2009 Corona FootVolley European Tour was established by inviting teams from Europe to play in Israel. In 2011 Corona FootVolley European Tour was upgraded to Corona FootVolley World Tour inviting teams from all over the world to play.

Corona FootVolley Winter Cup, a two-day tournament, is also played in Israel every February since 2010.
Since 2016 the IFA (Israel footvolley association) started to arrange footvolley all over the country, including &quot;Israel footvolley league&quot; and the local ranking event under the partnership with the European footvolley league &quot;EFVL&quot;

===Italy===
The first Footvolley Italia Tour was in 2008 when a group of friends from Ravenna organized the event. Normally the tour is in the months of June, July and August and the tournaments that compose the tour are 4-5 a year. In Italy are used the international rules:court 9mx9m and the net 2,20m.

===Australia===
Footvolley Australia (FVA) is the first peak body responsible for footvolley in Australia. FVA was founded in 2007 in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. The organisation was formed to establish, guide and promote footvolley in Australia. The FVA is working on the development of the practice of footvolley by organising Footvolley Experience sessions for newcomers to the sport, footvolley education and coaching across Australia, the National Footvolley Tour, and participation in international competitions. Footvolley Australia is working with relevant international associations, especially in the Asia and Oceania regions, to promote the growth of the game.

<doc id="975761" wikidata="Q2724663" url="?curid=975761" title="Craig McDermott">
<text>Craig John McDermott (born 14 April 1965) is a former Australian cricketer. Between 1984 and 1996 he played 71 Tests for Australia, taking 291 wickets. Following the end of his playing career, he was the bowling coach for the Australian team for two spells between 2011 and 2016. McDermott was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup.

==International career==

McDermott was the spearhead of the Australian attack in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was powerfully built at 191 cm tall. He started his career with Queensland in 1983–84 and made his Test match debut in 1984–85 whilst still 19 against West Indies (his youth engendering his nickname &quot;Billy&quot; – from Billy the Kid). In his first Ashes tour of 1985, he took 30 wickets. But he was over-bowled and was burnt out. He had an excellent World Cup in 1987, helping Australia win the trophy. He took 18 wickets in the tournament, including 5/44 in the semi-final win over Pakistan.

McDermott was a rhythm bowler, and when this was right, he would have an aggressive approach to the wicket and an excellent sideways-on action, giving him sharp pace and outswing. He always saved his best for England, taking 32 wickets in the last full series that he was able to play before injuries took over. Injuries seemed to hit him at wrong times, and he missed the history-making West Indies tour of 1995, and most of the 1996 World Cup. He also missed most of the 1993 Ashes tour when Shane Warne and Merv Hughes shared the spoils in his absence. His best bowling analysis in Tests is 8/97 against England in 1991. He ended with 291 wickets from 70 Tests and 203 one-day wickets with the best analysis being the 5/44.

In batting, even though McDermott&#x27;s average was that of a tail-ender, he could still hit the ball with power and could stand his ground against fast bowling. In two of the closest Tests that Australia lost, McDermott played a key role with the bat. In January 1993, Australia lost by 1 run to West Indies when McDermott, on 18 and batting with stout resistance, was given out controversially when attempting to play a bouncer from Courtney Walsh. In January 1994, he was on 29 not out in the Test against South Africa that Australia lost by 5 runs in chasing 117.

As a fieldsman, McDermott was renowned for his powerful and accurate returns to the wicket-keeper from the outfield. The New Zealand player and administrator Walter Hadlee regarded McDermott as the best thrower-in he had ever seen.

===Five-wicket hauls===
In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a &quot;five–for&quot; or &quot;fifer&quot;) refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of August 2015 only 43 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at the international level. Craig John McDermott is a former Australian cricketer who, according to the sports journalist Greg Baum, was &quot;Australia&#x27;s premier strike bowler in the early 1990s&quot;. A right-arm fast bowler, he played 71 Test matches and 138 ODIs in his career, taking 291 and 203 wickets respectively. He took fourteen five-wicket hauls in Test cricket, including two in a single ten-wicket match, and one in the ODI format.

McDermott made his Test match debut for Australia against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in December 1984, with Richie Richardson being his first Test victim. His first Test five-wicket haul came at Lord&#x27;s in the second Test of the 1985 Ashes series in June of that year, taking 6 wickets for 70 runs in a 4-wicket victory for Australia. McDermott&#x27;s best bowling analysis in Test cricket is 8 for 97 against England in the fifth Test of the 1990–91 Ashes series. He was most successful against England, taking eight of his fourteen five-wicket hauls against them, including four during the 1994–95 Ashes in which he was named player of the series.

McDermott&#x27;s ODI debut came against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in January 1985. He did not bat and although he took the wicket of Viv Richards, Australia lost the game by seven wickets. McDermott played 138 ODIs, and took a solitary five-wicket haul against Pakistan in November 1987, in the Cricket World Cup semi-final. His figures of 5 for 44, and an Australian victory by 18 runs, saw him awarded man of the match as Australia progressed to the final.

==Coaching career==
On 12 May 2011, it was announced that McDermott had been appointed the new bowling coach for the Australian cricket team replacing Troy Cooley. On 11 May 2012, McDermott announced his resignation as Australia&#x27;s bowling coach, citing the heavy touring schedule as the reason. Craig McDermott has been appointed as the new bowling coach and consultant for Ireland cricket team. In November 2012, he announced that he would be opening a fast-bowling clinic.

McDermott returned to a coaching role with the Australian cricket team on a two-year contract in May 2014.

==Personal life==
McDermott&#x27;s sons, Alister McDermott and Ben McDermott are cricketers, playing for Queensland and Tasmania respectively.

<text>The second season of Dream Job, the ESPN American reality television show that searches for new on-air talent for the network, began on Tuesday, September 14, 2004. Like the show&#x27;s first season, this edition was also looking for a new anchor for &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. A talent search for the show had begun in late June, 2004. ESPN anchor Stuart Scott returned to host the new season.

==Judges==
The show&#x27;s judging panel had changes. Gone were first season judges Tony Kornheiser and LaVar Arrington, who had begun play for the Washington Redskins in the 2004–2005 NFL season. Kornheiser and Arrington were replaced by &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; contributor and &quot;Around the Horn&quot; panelist Woody Paige, and ESPN NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith. &quot;Cold Pizza&quot; co-host Kit Hoover and ESPN Vice-president of Talent, Al Jaffe, returned for the second season.

Unlike the judging panel, the voting for season two did not change. The viewing public still had one vote (which was given to the contestant who had received the highest number of votes from online voting and text messaging) to cut a contestant with. In the first two episodes, the judges were given one vote apiece to vote for a contestant to be cut, with two given to them for the third episode only, making episodes 4-10 also one-cut-apiece shows.

==Contestants==
Like the first two episodes of season one, the contestants were introduced in 2 groups of six. In episode one, the competing contestants were Valerie Hawrylko, a 31-year-old management consultant from Oakton, Virginia; Brian Startare, a 33-year-old health care management worker from Glassboro, New Jersey; Anish Shroff, a 22-year-old radio anchor who has recently graduated from Syracuse University; Grant Thompson, a 28-year-old writer and actor from Los Angeles; Joe Voyticky, a 37-year-old attorney from Brooklyn, New York; and K.C. James, a 44-year-old account executive from Los Angeles. James had won the Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card Contest to gain entry onto the show.

The next group of six was introduced in episode two, and, for the first time, featured a second Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card winner. Episode two&#x27;s competitors were Jason Ashworth, a 23-year-old assistant tour manager from New Freedom, Pennsylvania; Winston Bell, a 35-year-old banker from Cleveland; Jason Horowitz, a 21-year-old student at Syracuse University who originally hails from West Bloomfield, Michigan; Stephanie Rich, a 35-year-old travel coordinator from Arlington, Texas; Whitney Scott, a 24-year-old sports information assistant from Lockwood, Missouri; and David Holmes, the second Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card winner, a 22-year-old student at Kent State University from Uniontown, Ohio.

==Episodes==

===Episode One===
Like the first season, the first two episodes of the second season began with the main game being &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot;, and like the series premiere on February 22, 2004, each of the six contestants competing in the first episode of season two read two &quot;SportsCenter&quot; highlights, most of them being from sporting events from the past weekend. Thompson went first, and was criticized for being too &quot;schtick&quot; and comedic. James went next, paused twice during his highlight readings, and was criticised for the pauses. Shroff went third and made some mistakes, but was praised for being professional by all four judges.

After the first three contestants read their highlights, an intermission took place, in which a new game called &quot;Get Off the Fence&quot; was introduced. In this game, the contestants were split into three pairs. Each contestant was given a current sports issue which was to be debated by both contestants. Each pair was given two issues apiece. Hawrylko was said to be the best debater by all the judges, while Startare was called the worst. Smith even said he could see Startare sweat during the debate.

When &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; resumed, Voyticky read his highlights. He criticised for being boring and lacking energy. Hawrylko went next, and while she was praised for her debating, she was criticized for trying to tell too many jokes during her highlight readings. Startare was last to go, and Paige called him &quot;brutal.&quot; All six were criticized for using too many clichés.

===Voting===
With 3 votes, Voyticky was the first contestant cut from the show in its second season.

===Episode Two===
The second group of six was featured in the second episode. A second contestant was going to be cut, reducing the number of competitors to 10.

This show&#x27;s &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; was reading a list of &quot;Top 5 Plays&quot;, while video of those plays was shown. Horowitz was up first and was presented with a list of top 5 catches, which included a fish being caught at the Bassmaster Classic. All four judges (including Smith) praised Horowitz for writing and speaking clearly. Scott was next with a list of top 5 shots, including a great shot in a table tennis tournament. She was called &quot;solid&quot;, but Paige told her to &quot;keep improving.&quot; Holmes then took his turn, having the top 5 blocks for his segment, with the top block being an incredible knockaway by Detroit Pistons star Tayshaun Prince on Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller in game one of the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Holmes got half praise, half criticism, and was relieved when Smith let him off the hook for an average performance.

The in-between game was &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot;, a regular segment on the real &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, in which an anchor throws out a topic with an opinion attached to it, and two analysts debate (or even agree) on what they think. The contestants were split into three pairs like the previous week, and were given two topics each, ranging from &quot;Oscar De La Hoya should retire&quot; to &quot;The U.S. will win the Ryder Cup in 2006.&quot; Rich was unanimously called the worst debater, while Horowitz just barely won the title of best debater.

Unfortunately for Rich, she was up next in &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot;, where her list was the top 5 dives. Even worse, the judges (except for Paige) didn&#x27;t let up, as Hoover called her &quot;slow.&quot; Ashworth was next to take the stage, and his list was a list of top 5 saves. He was praised for his energy, but the judges he needed to back up his highlights with facts. Bell was the final contestant to take his turn on the evening with a list of top 5 hits. His enthusiasm was noticed by all, but Smith told him to smile more.

===Voting===
The vote was unanimous to cut Rich.

===Episode Three===
10 became 8 on night three, as for one episode only, two contestants would be voted off instead of one.

The &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; game for this evening was co-anchoring, although it was individuals being cut, not duos. The twist here was at the end of their segment, after a couple of highlight readings and a news story, the pairs would interview a player from a Major League Baseball team. Hawrylko and Horowitz were the first pair to go, and their interviewee was New York Yankees outfielder Gary Sheffield. Horowitz&#x27; interview skills were praised, while Hawrylko was said to have needed more work. As a team, Paige said they were good, but needed to display more chemistry. Ashworth and Startare were next to go, and they conducted their interview with Chicago Cubs pitcher Kent Mercker. Startare got praise for much-needed improvement from episode one. Ashworth was criticized for not asking questions that pertained to the current situation, and for asking questions that were too long. Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card winners Holmes and James were next, and their interviewee was Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins. Their lack of chemistry and their interviewing skills were both criticized. Said Paige, &quot;Guys, call your mamas, and tell them to keep the front porch light on. If you don&#x27;t get better than that, you&#x27;ll be home soon&quot;, a message for both of them, drawing a &quot;Wowza!&quot; from Hoover. Holmes was said to be the better of the two. Following Holmes and James was the debut of a new segment featuring real &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors giving advice to the remaining contestants, titled &quot;U.S. Air Force Wingman.&quot; The person giving the advice-the first &quot;Dream Job&quot; winner, Mike Hall. Hall told them &quot;less is more.&quot; &quot;Not every play needs a joke, not every highlight needs style, but every highlight &quot;does&quot; need information&quot;, he said. After the commercial break following Hall&#x27;s &quot;&quot;SportsCenter&quot; 101&quot;, it was time for Shroff and Scott to show what they could do. Their interviewee was Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher José Lima. A problem arose at the start of the interview, when Scott asked Lima, &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; (He could.) Jaffe said some of the teamwork seemed forced, that it was mediocre. Paige said the interview was embarrassing for both of them because of how it started, and that Shroff wasn&#x27;t as good as he was in week one. Smith said Scott was better than she was in week two, and agreed with Paige that Shroff had slipped from the first week. The last pair was Thompson and Bell, whose interviewee was Houston Astros catcher Brad Ausmus. Their chemistry was praised, and Bell was praised for telling the viewers at home who they would be interviewing him before the &quot;show&quot; started, something that no other contestant did that night.

===Voting===
The decision to cut James was unanimous. Hawrylko&#x27;s elimination kept both Wendy&#x27;s Wild Card Winners from being cut on the same night, as America&#x27;s decision to cut her broke the tie between her and Holmes.

===Episodes four through eight===
===Voting===
America&#x27;s vote had broken the tie. Just two men were left: David Holmes and Grant Thompson.

===Episode ten===
Airing on Tuesday, November 16, 2004, both Holmes and Thompson knew that no mistake would be minor, and that one small error could cost their chance at becoming the anchor. The night opened with Holmes and Thompson going head-to-head in a debate game called &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot;, exactly like the ESPN talk show of the same name. The segment dealt with topics such as Barry Bonds winning his seventh National League Most Valuable Player award, and New York City&#x27;s bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Thompson and Holmes went back-and-forth with banter that pushed sarcastic boundaries most of the time. Both were praised by the judges for entertaining them, and Jaffe remarked about the 3 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) slot being a &quot;big hole&quot;, and that they should start a new show called &quot;The Grant and David Show&quot; featuring the two. Scott said it was the most he&#x27;d ever been entertained on the program in its two seasons of existence.

The next game was a trivia game called &quot;The Rundown.&quot; The game consisted of six categories, each containing three questions, all of which increased in difficulty in each category. All questions in the game were worth one point apiece. One player was told to pick a category, and only he could answer the first question as soon as it was given. If he got it right, then he got first chance to answer the next question. If he got it wrong, then the second player would be given the opportunity to correctly answer the question, and if he got it right, then the right to exclusively answer each question first would switch to him. If they both got it wrong, then the contestant who gave the last correct answer would be given first chance to answer the next question or told to pick a new category. Thompson soundly defeated Holmes in this game by a score of 10–3.

Then came the season&#x27;s final &quot;My &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; segment. Thompson and Holmes would be paired up with real &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors and perform tasks exactly like the sports news show&#x27;s anchors perform daily. Both pairs would read highlights and stories, while each contestant would have extra pressure placed on them to see how they performed under difficult circumstances, such as the TelePrompter failing while they were reading a story, or doing a highlight while having a producer read tell them what they were seeing through their IFB. Thompson and Holmes were also told just minutes before their segment that they would be interviewing the New England Patriots&#x27; Willie McGinest. Holmes was paired up with Steve Levy, while Thompson was paired up with &quot;Dream Job&quot; season one winner Mike Hall. Both pairs were praised for having good chemistry, while Holmes garnered the most praise for being almost flawless, but Thompson stumbled badly during his segment, and, as the voting would show, gave away the title.

===Voting===
David Holmes won season 2 of Dream Job.

Later on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; that night, Holmes was given trivia questions to try to see how much money he would make in his first year as an ESPN employee. He started out at $60,000, with each correct answer being worth $5,000 apiece. He got as high as the $75,000 question, which he got wrong, bumping his first-year salary back to $70,000. Holmes was also awarded with a brand-new Mazda 6 5-door car.

(*)&quot;The asterisk is placed next to Jaffe because America&#x27;s vote was read before the judges&#x27; votes were given, so when Smith said he voted to cut Thompson, Scott said, &quot;We don&#x27;t need to go on&quot;, and Thompson was immediately sent off, but not before hugging Holmes. Scott eventually turned to Jaffe, who said that if his vote had been necessary, he would also have cut Thompson.&quot;

<doc id="975773" wikidata="Q5464163" url="?curid=975773" title="Foilboard">
<text>A foilboard, also known as a hydrofoil board or foil surfboard, is a type of board used in water sports; it is distinct from surfboards in that it has a hydrofoil rather than fins mounted underneath. This hydrofoil design allows the surfboard and its rider to rise above the water’s surface, allowing for fast speeds and increased maneuverability in a wide range of surf conditions.  Foilboards are becoming increasingly popular across many water sports, including surfing, kiteboarding, windsurfing, and wakeboarding. Foilboards have also been used in competitions, with riders reaching speeds of up to 30 km/h while performing acrobatic maneuvers such as flips and twists.

==History==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Laird Hamilton, an influential big wave surfer and waterman, began experimenting with attaching hydrofoils to surfboards, with the aim of achieving faster speeds and smoother rides on large waves. Laird Hamilton later discovered the foilboard&#x27;s capability to harness swell energy with the use of a jet ski, pulling the rider into a wave. 

In 1999, Mango Carafino, a prominent waterman of Maui North Shore, designed and manufactured the first hydrofoils out of Maui for kitesurfing and created the discipline of hydrofoil kitesurfing.

== Design and components ==

The design of a foilboard consists of two primary components: the board and the hydrofoil. The board is usually made from lightweight materials such as carbon fiber or foam, making it easier to lift above the water. Attached to the bottom of the board is the hydrofoil, which consists of the mast as well as the front and back wings. The front wing is responsible for providing lift, while the back wing helps with stability and maneuverability. The mast, usually made with carbon fiber, connects the bottom of the board with the hydrofoil, keeping it submerged in the water in order to generate lift. Foilboards also typically have foot straps or pads for the riders to secure their feet to the board so they can control their balance as they approach higher speeds and move with greater agility.

Hydrofoils work by generating lift as they move through water, lifting the board out of the water and reducing drag. As water flows over the hydrofoil, it creates a pressure differential that causes the water to push up on the foil, generating lift. Adding a hydrofoil to a board can significantly increase the speed and efficiency, allowing the rider to reach greater speeds proportional to the lift generated; because of this, hydrofoils are extremely popular in racing and high performance applications.

=== Types of hydrofoils ===
Foilboards can be categorized into three main types based on the shape of the hydrofoil wing, each of which caters to different ability levels.

==== Flat-wing ====
Flat-wing hydrofoils have a straight, flat wing profile that are known for their stability and ease of use, making them ideal for beginners or recreational users. They are relatively inexpensive compared to other types of hydrofoils and are also commonly seen on yachts, boats, and surfboards.

==Kiteboarding==
Hydrofoil kiteboards are foilboards which use a kite as their mode of propulsion. 

The hydrofoil minimizes the effects of choppy or rough conditions. Due to the hydrofoil&#x27;s underwater characteristics, the rider can angle higher into the wind than on traditional kiteboards which ride on the surface of the water.

On the Island of Maui, Mango Carafino began the development of fabricating hydrofoil boards for riding with the use of a kite. Carafino later went on to fabricate Carafino Hydrofoil foil boards in China, at the Jin Li factory, with the assistance of Maurico Bauldi and Paulo Iannetti. For over ten years, the world laughed at Carafino, calling him a kook for introducing a board too futuristic for the industry to accept.

Carafino introduced the hydrofoil in 2008 in Frejus, Cote &#x27;d Azur, France. There the French began to race with the Carafino hydrofoil board, creating the competitive aspect of hydrofoil kite board racing. The sport later went on to experience back yard designers tweeting the foils to garner more speed when racing. Finally, the Olympic sailing federation incorporated the hydrofoil kiteboard into the Olympic class. In 2014 Carafino left the industry, apparently as a result of the flood of competition and knockoffs of his design. Laird Hamilton innovated the use of the board riding in swells with the assistance of expert waterman Terry Chun of Kauai, North Shore.

==Wing foiling==
Another application of the foilboard is in Wing foiling, where propulsion is derived from a lightweight wing controlled by the rider.

==Windsurfing==

Rush Randle, a noted acrobatic surfer and big wave windsurfer, is credited with being the first ever to mount a hydrofoil to a windsurfing board, performing forward loops with the hydrofoil mounted below on the outer reefs of Maui.

Foils are used on wind-surfboards through design development from Neil Pryde Maui, inventors of hydrofoil sailing &quot;windsurfing&quot; boards. Using a moderately sized sail, a foil windboard can achieve speeds over 6 knots faster than the apparent wind. With advancements in hydrofoil design the energy required to stay on foil was reduced to levels achievable by human power alone. Kai Lenny pioneered a technique now called &quot;pumping&quot; in which the rider shifts their weight over the axis of rotation, driving the foil through the water column which generates lift.

==Foiling in Olympic events==
Windfoiling debuted as an Olympic event in 2024 with foil windsurfing and kitefoiling represented. For the former, the Starboard IQFoil gear was adopted.

=== Events involving foiling ===
==Powered foilboards==
Various manufacturers and individuals have developed powered foilboards. Electrically powered ones are often referred to as &quot;eFoils&quot;. EFoils have a mast connected to an electric motor.

===Notable journeys===
In 2021 a father and son crossed the English Channel on electric-powered propeller-driven hydrofoil boards. They covered 23 miles in one hour and 44 minutes at an average speed of 13 mph on a single battery charge, arriving with 4% charge left.

On July 19, 2024, 65 year old Bryan Holland circumnavigated Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire via eFoil. Holland’s course visited the five ports of the as part of an Annual Rafting for Wishes Make-A-Wish fundraising event. Holland’s route was Weirs Beach, Meredith, Center Harbor, Wolfeboro, Alton Bay returning to the start and completing the 60 mile circumnavigation in 4 hours, 50 minutes. Having reserve energies, Holland continued on and finished his epic ride in Meredith clocking a total 68.87 miles in 5 hours, 15 minutes. During the ride, Holland was accompanied by a support boat and swapped five different batteries.

<text>James Kelham (1796 – 1 April 1882) was a New Zealand businessman and politician.

==Biography==

He arrived in Wellington in the ship &quot;London&quot; in 1842, and was the New Zealand Company&#x27;s accountant in Wellington. He was prominent in Wellington&#x27;s early business community, and was elected as first chairman of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce in 1856.

He represented the City of Wellington in the 1st New Zealand Parliament, but resigned on 3 August 1855. He also served on the Wellington Provincial Council, representing the City of Wellington electorate in 1856. He was made a Justice of the Peace in 1870. He owned land in Lower Hutt where he had a cottage built in the 1870s or 1880s; the building is these days the gatehouse of Vogel House.

He is buried in St James (Anglican) Churchyard, Lower Hutt. Ward&#x27;s &quot;Early Wellington&quot; erroneously says he died in 1862.

<text>USS &quot;Pipefish&quot; (SS-388/AGSS-388), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was sold for scrap in 1969.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pipefish&quot; was laid down on 31 May 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 12 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. George J. Bates, and commissioned on 22 January 1944. She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pipefish.

==Service history==
Following training off the East Coast, &quot;Pipefish&quot; proceeded via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 3 May 1944.

On her first war patrol - 24 May-16 July - &quot;Pipefish&quot; cruised west of the Mariana Islands, as a rescue submarine for pre-invasion carrier strikes on Saipan, saving one pilot on 12 June. She also cruised in the Surigao Straits to block Japanese escape from the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She moored at Majuro on 16 July.

On her second war patrol - 6 August-27 September - she patrolled off the southeastern coast of Honshū, Japan. &quot;Pipefish&quot; sank &quot;Hakutetsu Maru Number Seven&quot; on 12 September. While evading escorts after that attack, she struck bottom four times. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 September.

On her third war patrol - 28 October 1944 – 6 January 1945, &quot;Pipefish&quot; roamed southwest of Taiwan and off the east coast of Hainan Island, China, operating with , , and . On 30 November &quot;Pipefish&quot; was damaged from an air attack but remained on patrol in the South China Sea. Attacking a convoy, &quot;Pipefish&quot; sank &quot;Coastal Defense Vessel Number 64&quot; on 3 December. She arrived at Majuro on 6 January.

On her fourth war patrol - 31 January to 26 March - &quot;Pipefish&quot; provided rescue capability for downed aviators in the Nansei Shoto area.

During her fifth war patrol - 28 April to 16 June - she performed lifeguard duty for B-29 Superfortress aviators off Honshū, and in the Nanpō Islands area. &quot;Pipefish&quot; saved eight aviators on 26 May, 29 May, and 10 June. She moored at Midway Island on 16 June.

Her sixth war patrol - 15 July-28 August - called for lifeguard duty in the Nanpō Islands area and off the east coast of Kyūshū. On patrol she destroyed eight naval mines. Following termination of hostilities with Japan she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 28 August, and then proceeded to the West Coast.

&quot;Pipefish&quot; decommissioned on 19 March 1946, and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was redesignated AGSS-388 on 1 December 1962. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1967 and sold on 20 January 1969.

==Awards==
&quot;Pipefish&quot; received four battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="975790" wikidata="Q335800" url="?curid=975790" title="Felim O'Neill of Kinard">
<text>Sir Phelim Roe O&#x27;Neill of [[Caledon, County Tyrone|Kinard]] (Irish: &quot;Sir Féilim Rua Ó Néill na Ceann Ard&quot;; 1604–1653) was an Irish politician and soldier who started the Irish rebellion in Ulster on 23 October 1641. He joined the Irish Catholic Confederation in 1642 and fought in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms under his cousin, Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, in the Confederate Ulster Army. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland O’Neill went into hiding but was captured, tried and executed in 1653.








== Birth and origins ==
Phelim was born in 1604, the eldest son of Turlough O&#x27;Neill and his wife Catherine O&#x27;Neill. His father was a member of the Kinard branch of the O&#x27;Neills who were descendants of Shane O&#x27;Neill of Kinard, a half-brother of Conn Baccach O&#x27;Neill. His father and paternal grandfather were killed on 20 June 1608, while defending Kinard against the insurgents during the O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion. This grandfather, Sir Henry Óg O&#x27;Neill, had fought for his second cousin and father-in-law, Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone in the Nine Years&#x27; War, but had received a pardon and was confirmed in his lands in Tiranny and Minterburn. His second great-grandfather, Sean, a brother of Conn Bacach, had settled in Tynan parish by at least 1514 in a sub-district called Cluain Dabhal. Phelim&#x27;s name in Irish shows his paternal genealogy as: &quot;Felim mac Turlogh mac Henry Óg mac Henry mac Seán mac Conn Mór Ó Néill&quot; (father of Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill).

Phelim&#x27;s mother was Catherine, daughter of Turlough MacHenry O&#x27;Neill, chief of the Fews branch of the O&#x27;Neills. After Phelim&#x27;s father&#x27;s death, she remarried to Robert Hovenden, a Catholic of recent English descent. He had two half-brothers from his mother&#x27;s second marriage: Robert Hovenden and Alexander Hovenden. The latter was killed as a captain in 1644 fighting for Phelim.

== Early life ==
Felim, together with his younger brother Turlough, entered King&#x27;s Inns in London in June 1621, as a knowledge of the law was considered important for landowners of the era. He briefly converted to Protestantism, before returning to Catholicism.

He married three times. In 1629 he married a daughter of Arthur Magennis, the 3rd Viscount Magennis of Iveagh. Her first name is unknown.

On 17 March 1639 in Dublin O&#x27;Neill was knighted by Thomas Wentworth, Lord Deputy, thanks to the influence of his relation the Earl of Antrim. Shortly before the rebellion, O&#x27;Neill evicted some of his Gaelic tenants near Kinard and replaced them with British settler families who paid higher rents.

In summer 1641, O&#x27;Neill was elected MP for Dungannon in County Tyrone in a by-election for the Irish Parliament of 1640–1649, replacing Thomas Madden, who had died in office.

His first wife died in September 1641 shortly before the rebellion. He married secondly Louise, daughter of Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara, a younger brother of the 5th Viscount Gormanston.

== Rebellion ==

Like many Irish Catholics and especially Gaelic Irish Catholics, O&#x27;Neill felt threatened by the Protestant English government of Ireland. In particular, they were aggrieved at Catholic exclusion from public office and the continual confiscations of Catholic-owned land. Another reason pressing him into desperate action was that Phelim was deep in debt. 

=== Plot ===
This fear reached its high point in the late 1630s and early 1640s, when Thomas Wentworth, Lord Deputy for Charles I, was known to be planning widespread new plantations. A crisis point was reached in 1641, when the Scottish Covenanters and English Long Parliament threatened to invade Ireland to finally subdue Catholicism there. In this atmosphere of fear and paranoia, Phelim O&#x27;Neill became involved in a plot hatched by fellow Gaelic Irish Catholics from Ulster, to seize Dublin and swiftly take over the other important towns of Ireland. After this, they planned to issue their demands for full rights for Catholics and Irish self-government in the King&#x27;s name. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s role was to take towns and fortified places in the north of the country whereas Maguire was tasked with seizing Dublin Castle.

O&#x27;Neill was a latecomer to the plot, brought into it by Lord Maguire in early September 1641. On 23 October 1641 he surprised Lord Caulfeild in Charlemont Fort. O&#x27;Neill was instrumental in shaping many of the political objectives of the rebellion. He rapidly assumed command of the Ulster rising.

=== Outbreak ===
However, the plan to take Dublin was bungled by two conspirators, Maguire and MacMahon, who were captured by the authorities. O&#x27;Neill went ahead and started the rebellion in the north, capturing the important fort of Charlemont but quickly found that he could not control the Irish Catholic peasantry he had raised. These people, many of whom had been displaced during the Plantation of Ulster, began attacking the Scottish and English Protestant settlers with varying intensity over a period of 5 months. Being in command, O&#x27;Neill has been blamed for complicity or lack of oversight in these massacres, the detail of which is still a matter of contentious debate.

On 24 October 1641 O&#x27;Neill issued the Proclamation of Dungannon in which he claimed to have the King&#x27;s authorisation to rise in defence of the Crown and the Catholic religion. On 4 November 1641 O&#x27;Neill repeated these claims in his proclamation alongside Rory Maguire at Newry and read out a commission from Charles I of England dated 1 October, commanding him to seize: &quot;... all the forts, castles, and places, of strength and defence within the kingdom, except the places, persons, and estates of Our loyal and loving subjects the Scots; also to arrest and seize the goods, estates, and persons of all the English Protestants, within the said kingdom to Our use. And in your care and speedy performance of this Our will and pleasure We shall rely on your wonted duty and allegiance to Us which We shall accept and reward in due time.&quot; This gave O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces the impression that they were acting within the law. Charles later denied having issued the commission.

In November O&#x27;Neill attacked Lisburn several times but failed to take it.

Like other rebel leaders, O&#x27;Neill had difficulty with the discipline of his troops, which was compounded by his comparative lack of social status. In an effort to improve this O&#x27;Neill planned to have himself declared Earl of Tyrone at the historic site of Tullyhogue.

Nalson, in his &quot;History of the General Rebellion in Ireland&quot;, described O&#x27;Neill as: &quot;Sir Phelemy Roe O Neill, captain-generall of all the rebels, and chieftain of the O Neills, O Hagans, O Quyns, O Mellans, O Hanlons, O Corrs, McCans, McCawells, Mac Enallyes, O Gormelys, and the rest of the Irish septs in the counties of Tyrone and Ardmagh.&quot;

== Confederate ==
The rebellion quickly spread to the rest of Ireland. By the spring of 1642 only fortified Protestant enclaves, around Dublin, Cork and Derry, held out. King Charles I sent a large army to Ireland, which would probably have put down the rebellion, had the English Civil War not broken out. As it was, the Irish Catholic upper classes had breathing space to form the Irish Catholic Confederation, which acted as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent government of Ireland until 1649. Phelim O&#x27;Neill was a member of the Confederate&#x27;s General Assembly, but was sidelined in the leadership of Irish Catholics by wealthier landed magnates.

O&#x27;Neill was also sidelined on the military side. After his disastrous defeat on 16 July 1642 at Glenmaquin near Raphoe in County Donegal against the Protestant Laggan Army led by Sir Robert Stewart, his kinsman, Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, a professional soldier, arrived from the Spanish Netherlands and was made general of the Confederate&#x27;s Ulster army. Phelim O&#x27;Neill served as cavalry commander under him and spent most of the next six years fighting against the Scottish Covenanter army that had landed in Ulster. He fought in the army&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Benburb on 5 June 1646.

In Confederate politics, O&#x27;Neill was a moderate, advocating a deal with Charles I and the Irish and English Royalists as a means of winning the war against the English Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters. In 1648, he voted for such a deal, the Second Ormond Peace, splitting with Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, who opposed it along with most of the Ulster army. He and several other moderates such as Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim and Arthur Magennis, Viscount Iveagh left the Ulster army because of their dispute with the hard-liners. In the summer of that year, the Confederate armies fought among themselves over this issue, with the pro-Royalists prevailing.

However, this was not enough to stop Ireland from being conquered by the New Model Army of Oliver Cromwell in 1649–53. The well-trained and supplied Parliamentarians crushed all Confederate and Royalist resistance and imposed a harsh settlement on Irish Catholics.

== Third marriage ==
In November 1649 O&#x27;Neill married Jean Gordon, the widow of Claud Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Strabane, who had died on 14 June 1638.

== Defeat at Scarrifholis and surrender of Charlemont ==
O&#x27;Neill fought in the Ulster Army at the Battle of Scarrifholis in 1650 where it was routed by Charles Coote, 2nd Baronet of Castle Cuff. O&#x27;Neill escaped from the battle and retreated with a rest of the Ulster army to the Charlemont Fort. Together with his stepson James Hamilton, 3rd Baron Hamilton of Strabane he held the fort against Coote, inflicting heavy casualties on the English troops in the Siege of Charlemont, but surrendered on terms on 6 August 1650 and marching away with his remaining troops was expected to embark and take service in France. However, O&#x27;Neill decided to rather go into hiding.

== Trial and execution ==
Anyone implicated in the Rebellion of 1641 was held responsible for the massacres of Protestant civilians and was executed. O&#x27;Neill was specifically named as a ringleader in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and could therefore expect no mercy. A bounty of £100 was put on his head. O&#x27;Neill was captured on 4 February 1653 by William Caulfeild, 1st Viscount Charlemont on a &quot;crannog&quot; (artificial island) in Roughan Lough next to Roughan Castle, Newmills, County Tyrone where he had taken refuge. He was taken to Dublin, where his trial was held. He was found guilty, hanged, drawn and quartered for treason on 10 March 1653.

O&#x27;Neill may have been able to avoid execution had he testified that he had Charles I&#x27;s commission for the uprising of 1641, as the Parliamentarians claimed at the time. However, O&#x27;Neill refused to do so. He was survived by at least one child, Gordon O&#x27;Neill, who would serve as a colonel in the Jacobite forces during the Williamite War.

== Phelim O&#x27;Neill in literature ==
O&#x27;Neill is depicted as a historical character in several books. Annraoi Ó Liatháin&#x27;s Irish-language novel &quot;Dún na Cinniúna&quot; centres on the 1651 siege of Charlemont Fort in Tyrone.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s defeat at the battle of Glanmaquin in 1642 is described in Darach Ó Scolaí&#x27;s novel &quot;An Cléireach&quot;.

The use of &quot;P. O&#x27;Neill&quot; as a pseudonym in Provisional IRA public statements is thought by some to be a reference to Phelim O&#x27;Neill.

<text>Joseph Richard Skeen (June 30, 1927 – December 7, 2003) was an American politician who served as a congressman from southern New Mexico. A conservative Republican, he served for eleven terms in the United States House of Representatives between 1981 and 2003.

==Early life and education==
Skeen was born in Roswell, New Mexico. During his teenage years, his family moved to Seattle. During the final year of World War II, Skeen entered the United States Navy. After returning home, he graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas.

== 1980 congressional election ==
Incumbent Five-term Democratic Congressman Harold Runnels was renominated in the Democratic primary and was set to be unopposed in the general election, after the Republican party failed to nominate any candidate. Runnels suddenly died of cancer on August 5, 1980, at the age of fifty-six. The state attorney general published an advisory opinion that the Democrats could replace Runnels on the ballot, as he had been nominated in the primary, but Republicans could not, as no candidate had filed in the preceding primary election. Republicans coalesced behind a write-in effort by Skeen, while the Democrats selected Governor Bruce King&#x27;s nephew, David King, over Runnels&#x27; widow, Dorothy Runnels. Runnels decided to run her own write-in campaign after failing to be selected by the Democratic Party. Skeen was elected with 61,564 votes (38 percent) to King&#x27;s 55,085 (34 percent), and Runnels&#x27; 45,343 (28 percent). He was helped by the splitting of the Democratic vote between King and Runnels, as well as Ronald Reagan carrying the district. Skeen was only the third person in U.S. history to be elected to Congress as a write-in candidate.

As a congressman, Skeen had a largely conservative voting record but also brought numerous projects to his district. In contrast to most congressmen, Skeen faced several competitive races for reelection. After skating to reelection from 1982 to 1990, including two completely unopposed bids in 1988 and 1990, he faced aggressive Democratic challenges for most of the 1990s.

He announced in 1997 that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Skeen announced his retirement from Congress in 2002 and left at the end of his 11th term in 2003. At the time of his death in 2003, he was highly regarded by New Mexicans in both parties for his service to his state.

On October 10, 2002, Skeen voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq.

<text>Thomas King (1858 – 16 March 1916) was a New Zealand astronomer. 
==Early life==

King was born in Glasgow, Scotland and came to Auckland with his parents as an infant. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School. He later received private tuition in Wellington.

==Carter Observatory==

Thomas King took over the charge of the Carter Observatory in 1887 from the Reverend Arthur Stock, vicar of St Peters (former astronomer in charge of the Wellington time-ball station on Lambton House Quay).

King has an astronomical observatory facility named after him at Carter Observatory in Wellington, New Zealand.

== Thomas King Observatory==

The Thomas King Observatory () in Wellington, near the Carter Observatory, is now in constant use following the restoration of it and its telescope.

In May 2001 Gordon Hudson began the refurbishment of the 5 inch Grubb Telescope housed in the Thomas King Observatory. This telescope was made in 1882 by Grubb in Dublin and over its 120 years it is in remarkably good condition.

==Death==

King died on 16 March 1916 in Wellington.

<text>Floor 13 is a strategy video game published by Virgin Games in 1991. The game set in the United Kingdom, where the player is the director of a secret governmental agency involved in clandestine domestic operations; the headquarters is hidden on the thirteenth floor of a bank building in London Docklands, hence the title. A follow-up, &quot;Floor 13: Deep State&quot;, was released in November 2020.

== Plot ==
The player takes on the role of the Director General of the &quot;Department of Agriculture and Fisheries&quot;, a non-existent executive agency that conceals a secret police which keeps the government popular by any means necessary. Answering only to the Prime Minister, the Director General has the power to use wiretapping, surveillance, smear tactics, disinformation, burglary, kidnapping, torture, and assassination to keep the government popular with the people.

In addition to the Director General&#x27;s regular duties suppressing and removing those who threaten the status quo, there is a subplot involving his membership in a secret society called &quot;The Secret Masters of Thoth&quot;. These missions, which are received from a &quot;Secret Master&quot; wearing the vestments of an Egyptian pharaoh, involve more bizarre opposition than regular missions; these missions include protecting a fellow member from a Mafia assassination, foiling an attempt to subvert the nation by pod people in key positions, the protection of the Church of the SubGenius from a scandal, and restraining the growing power of the Illuminati, among others.

The game contains numerous references to real-world groups, trends, scandals, and unusual occurrences that were newsworthy in the 1980s and early 1990s, including the Irish Troubles, Shining Path, the BCCI scandal, and the apparent suicides of Roberto Calvi and Jonathan Moyle.

== Gameplay ==
The game is menu-driven and presents the player with scenarios through reports viewable in the Director General&#x27;s office each day. Each scenario represents a potential scandal that may hurt the government&#x27;s popularity if not properly handled by the player. The player interacts with the game by issuing orders to eight different departments which represent the capabilities available to the Director General (such as surveillance, assassination, interrogation, or disinformation) to use those capabilities against individuals, locations, or groups involved in each scenario. Once each day&#x27;s reports are read and any orders have been issued, the player can advance to the next day to see the results of their orders and the progress of scenarios. Each scenario is scripted and will generally always proceed in the same way absent the player&#x27;s intervention (with minor details such as names and pictures of individuals changed), but some of the results of the player&#x27;s orders are randomised (for example, assassination attempts may fail or interrogation of individuals may or may not reveal particular information). Each individual or group is rated in the reports as to prominence, power, and orientation towards the government, attributes that will affect the likelihood of success of attempted actions taken against them and the likely results on public opinion. Some scenarios have multiple possible resolutions depending on what means the player chooses to use, and may also generate positive press, raising the government&#x27;s popularity, if handled well.

During the course of the game, there are two possible ways to lose. Every 21 days, the Prime Minister reviews the opinion polls and will fire the player if the government&#x27;s approval rating is under 50%. If the player is too severe in using aggressive means that attract unwelcome public attention, the player will be fired by &#x27;Mr. Garcia&#x27;, an assassin sent by the Prime Minister, and thrown out of their office window. If the government still has the lead in the polls every 21 days, the player will be given more money and employees to work with. With luck, the player can temporarily keep their job by spying on and ignoring or discrediting suspects without using more severe and obvious methods such as &quot;removal&quot;, &quot;interrogation&quot; or &quot;heavy assault&quot;; however, if the player is clumsy or blatant, the Prime Minister will increasingly threaten the player with death.

If the player manages to avoid being fired, then the game has two possible successful endings. If the player has successfully navigated through every scandal encountered for an entire year while keeping the approval rating above 50%, the government realises that the player knows too much and appoints him or her Prime Minister, with a final note to &quot;enjoy it while it lasts&quot;. The other ending involves successfully completing all seven Secret Master missions; in this ending, the player is anointed the new head of the Secret Masters of Thoth and the face of the character is shown.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Charles Ardai called &quot;Floor 13&quot; &quot;the most unpleasant espionage game ever made&quot;, comparing it to a James Bond fan&#x27;s reaction to &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (&quot;It is simply handled poorly&quot;). Beyond disliking the KGB or Gestapo-like &quot;loathsome secret police activity&quot; the game depicted, he wrote of the gameplay that &quot;Hannah Arendt could not have conceived of more banal evil. &quot;Floor 13&quot; turns acts of unmitigated cruelty into bloodless, arm&#x27;s length bureaucratic functions ... a type and quality of gameplay that was obsolete in 1978&quot;.

Cara Ellison mentions the game as it appears in the Internet Archive, pointing out that it seems quite modern. It &quot;simulates the detached bureaucracy a totalitarian government would have to put in place to actually control things, making you increasingly aware that this might be why governments recruit such boring rich people&quot;

<doc id="975814" wikidata="Q5012472" url="?curid=975814" title="CKO">
<text>CKO was a Canadian radio news network which operated from 1977 to 1989. The CKO call sign was shared by twelve network-owned stations, as listed below.

The network was owned by Canada All-News Radio Ltd. AGRA Industries was originally a 45 percent partner in the network, but by 1988 it was the sole owner. David Ruskin was the network&#x27;s founding president.

==History==
On July 12, 1976, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved a licence for CKO to Canada All News Radio Limited. Twelve transmitters were required to be in place across the country and ready for broadcast by the fall of 1979.

With a recorded message from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to launch it, the CKO radio network started broadcasting on July 1, 1977 with stations in Ottawa and Toronto. Power problems delayed the start of the Ottawa station by an hour. Stories included much American content, plus two features about prostitutes. One announcer mispronounced Arkansas several times in one newscast and was reportedly dismissed.

Later that year, stations were added in Montreal (by acquisition of AM station CFOX), London, Vancouver and Calgary. The Vancouver station began with a news staff of ten, including news director Cam Scott, Gerry Gifford, Richard Dettman, Stan Crossley, Bill Rodger, Norm Bright and Joanna Piros. Scott was replaced in 1978 by Peter Ray, who had been transferred from the Montreal station. After Ray&#x27;s departure that year, Tom Spear was hired from CHWK Chilliwack in December 1978 until most local programming was curtailed in August 1980.

The news network began live broadcasts of Question Period from the Canadian House of Commons in late 1977; for nearly all Canadians, it was the first regular, live access to House proceedings as it would be well over two years before the CBC Parliamentary Television Network began regular nationwide video distribution to most cable systems.

In November 1977, the Calgary station was opened with Bob Quinn as its first news director. He expanded coverage in Alberta and was instrumental in the network&#x27;s coverage of the Kosmos 954 satellite crash in the Northwest Territories in January 1978 and the crash of Pacific Western Airlines Flight 314 in Cranbrook, BC a few weeks later. Reporter Bill Pringle was the first journalist at the crash scene. Calgary coverage centered on local news and the booming Alberta energy sector. The Calgary and Edmonton reporters joined forces to broadcast the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. The Calgary stationed featured numerous local features reflecting the skills on the staff and balanced network&#x27;s national approach. Calgary and Edmonton produced a regional afternoon newscast, &quot;Alberta Today&quot;. It was often co-anchored by Cliff Oginski in Edmonton and Calgary&#x27;s Bill Pringle.

In 1978, a station was added in Edmonton under station manager/news director Garfield Chesson. He made CKO Edmonton a key supplier of national news reportage in the era of the Trudeau government&#x27;s National Energy Program. Edmonton journalists Cliff Oginski, Ian Kinsey, Karen Brown and Bob Unger balanced a perceived Toronto slant to national issues.

CKO closed the London studio that year due to poor ad sales.

After its first anniversary, the network faced low ratings and higher financial losses than expected. However, it was hoped that a planned advertising campaign would help boost awareness of the station. The Toronto transmitter power was also to be increased to 100,000 watts in by the end of 1978.

CKO began live sports broadcasts for Toronto Maple Leafs hockey and National Football League football in late 1978. CKFH previously carried the Maple Leafs games and attempted to have the CRTC stop CKO&#x27;s hockey broadcasts. The CRTC rejected CKFH&#x27;s complaint, on the rationale that sports broadcasts were within CKO&#x27;s programming commitments.

In 1985, CKO added a station in Halifax.

Maclean-Hunter sold its Newsradio broadcast syndication division to CKO in August 1987.

In 1986, CKO applied to convert its Montreal outlet to 95.1 MHz; that application was denied on March 19, 1987. (95.1 FM has since been occupied by CBF-FM, after that station&#x27;s relocation from 690 kHz in 1998.) On June 20, 1989, the commission approved an application by changing the frequency from 1470 kHz to 650 kHz, as a way to improve reception in areas of Montreal Island; CKO&#x27;s frequency change proposal was never implemented.

In 1988, CKO filed an application with the CRTC to trade frequencies with Toronto AM station CKEY 590. The transaction would have included a payment of $4 million to CKO which the network would have used to launch three more stations (Regina, Saint John and St. John&#x27;s) for which it already held licenses, but had not been financially able to establish. However, the CRTC denied the application on April 25, 1988. Later the same year, AGRA transferred its 99% ownership in CKO to its majority-owned media division, Cybermedix. In March 1989, the network under its restructured ownership declared to the CRTC that it would no longer have financial losses by 1993.

Later that year, CKO established a station in Winnipeg, which became the network&#x27;s final new station before its closure.

Ted Tevan briefly hosted a weekday sports talk show on the network. Although Tevan was from Montreal, CKO&#x27;s Montreal station did not have a suitable studio for the program, forcing Tevan to commute to Toronto. Tevan quit CKO after the network rejected his offer to set up a Montreal studio.

In 1989, AGRA agreed in principle to sell Cybermedix to Montreal-based broadcaster Cogeco, which planned to sell off Cybermedix&#x27; medical labs while keeping CKO and the Cybermedix cable systems in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. However, there was no timetable for the CRTC to approve the deal, and Cogeco would not be allowed to operate CKO until the sale was approved. As a result, with the transaction still pending before the CRTC and no prospect of stanching CKO&#x27;s mounting losses in the interim, AGRA decided to euthanize the network. On November 10, network president Bill Stewart told employees via conference call that CKO was shutting its doors. While this meeting was taking place, the network abruptly went off the air in the middle of the noon (Eastern Time) broadcast, never to return. It lost a reported $55 million during its existence.

The broadcast licenses were surrendered to the CRTC, which formally revoked them on August 15, 1990.

<text>The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack is an EP released by British band New Order in 2003. It was produced to accompany a Peter Saville exhibition, &quot;The Peter Saville Show&quot;, which appeared at London&#x27;s Design Museum in 2003, and from 23 January to 18 April 2004 at Urbis in Manchester.

Peter Saville was a partner in Factory Records and a graphic designer who designed many record sleeves for Joy Division and New Order throughout their careers at Factory Records. The exhibition included this artwork and other graphic design from Saville&#x27;s ongoing career.

Although &quot;The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack&quot; is credited to New Order, only New Order members Stephen Morris, Peter Hook and Phil Cunningham were involved in producing the music - Bernard Sumner was not present for the recording. This was a CD-only release, limited to 3,000 copies. It was released by London Records with the catalogue number &quot;SAVILLE1&quot;.

As is typical of many New Order releases, the sleeve of the CD has no printed information of its contents. The front cover shows Saville at his drawing board, whereas the back shows a screen print frame for the Peter Saville Show exhibition poster. The inner sleeve (made of a slightly lighter weight card) shows two photographs (one on front and one on back) of the exhibition artwork in preparation. The disc itself states that The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack was written and produced by New Order and mixed by Merv De Peyer. It also states that the design and photography was by the Graphic Thought Facility. The only indication of a catalogue number is shown on the reverse (shiny) side of the disc. Around the centre hole clearly reads &#x27;DISCTRONICS&#x27; and &#x27;SAVILLE 1 01&#x27;.

<text>Stony Brook State Park is a state park located in Steuben County, New York. It is located south of Dansville, Livingston County, New York Dansville, Steuben County, New York on New York State Route 36.

==History==
Stony Brook became a summer tourist spot in the late 19th century, following the construction of a railroad in 1883. The resort fell into decline by the 1920s. New York state resurrected the area by buying the land and establishing the state park in 1928.

Stony Brook was enhanced in the 1930s by improvements constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. The footprint of these government programs is evident throughout the park in the form of hiking paths, bridges, picnic areas, and buildings.

==Park description and facilities==
The signature attraction of the park is the eponymous brook, which is an example of small, post-glacial streams in the Finger Lakes area. The small creeks and brooks in this area cut through the Great Lakes-area escarpments following retreat of the ice age glaciers, creating deep, narrow gorges, with many waterfalls, which are uncommonly accessible.

Initially , the park is now . It offers two stream-fed swimming pools, picnic tables and pavilions, a playground, a nature trail, hiking, fishing and bow-hunting (deer), a campground with tent and trailer sites, and cross-country skiing. The park has an upper and lower entrance, connected only by Route 36 and trails.

As do some other parks in the region, such as Fillmore Glen State Park, Robert H. Treman State Park, and Buttermilk Falls State Park, the park features a semi-natural swimming pool, created by a small dam constructed in the lower reaches of the stream.

<doc id="975832" wikidata="Q6784007" url="?curid=975832" title="Mass Production (band)">
<text>Mass Production is an American funk/disco musical group, best known for their 1979 hit, &quot;Firecracker.&quot; Based in Norfolk, Virginia, the ten-piece group had a series of minor R&amp;B hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;Firecracker&quot; is commonly misattributed to the similarly named (and sonically/stylistically similar) band Brass Construction.

==History==
The band consisted of Kevin &quot;D&#x27;No&quot; Douglas (bass and vocals), James &quot;Otiste&quot; Drumgole (trumpet, flugelhorn, clarinet, flute, piccolo and vocals), Agnes &quot;Tiny&quot; Kelly (lead vocals, vocoder; later replaced by Dee (DeeDee) Henderson), George Jefferson (trombone), Larry Marshall (lead vocals, triangle, percussion and xylophone), Gregory “Sagittarius” McCoy (saxophone, tuba, bassoon and kazoo), Emmanuel Redding (percussion, kettle drums and marimba), Ricardo Williams (lead vocals, drums, percussion), Tyrone Williams (keyboards), Rodney Phelps (lead guitar, keyboards) and LeCoy Bryant (rhythm guitar, vocals). Phelps left the band prior to the recording of their 1980 &quot;Massterpiece&quot; album, leaving Bryant to handle all guitar duties. Phelps was later replaced by Dan Harris (lead guitar). Harris toured with the group as a freelance guitarist for a couple of years, then left the band to work as a recording session musician. The band would soon expand back to ten, with Samuel Williams joining on drums in the early 1980s, allowing Ricardo Williams to concentrate more on vocals.

In addition to &quot;Firecracker,&quot; which hit number four on the R&amp;B chart in the late summer of 1979, other hits by the band include &quot;Cosmic Lust&quot;, &quot;Groove Me&quot;, “Shanté” and &quot;Turn Up the Music.&quot; The group stayed together for several more years, scoring a string of small hits, before deciding to disband in 1983. At that time, the group’s popularity was such that they were the only people who knew they had disbanded. 

Mass Production has recently reunited with the mostly original lineup, is in the process of recording new material, and has been playing live shows since 2017.

&quot;Firecracker&quot; was sampled by 2 Live Crew for their 1989 hit single &quot;Me So Horny&quot;, from their album &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot;.

<text>Dr Walter Lee (1811 – 29 January 1887) was a 19th-century New Zealand politician.

==Biography==


Lee arrived in New Zealand in 1842. He represented the Northern Division (a territory north of Auckland but south of Whangārei) in the 1st Parliament and the 2nd Parliament; serving from 1853 to 1860, when he retired.

A Catholic, Lee opposed the reading of prayers at the start of Parliament, saying that any prayer would have an inevitable bias towards one faith or another.

Lee also served on the Auckland Provincial Council, representing the Northern Division electorate in 1857 and 1858. He was chairman of the initial Auckland City Council. He fell ill with a chronic liver disease and a week later, on 29 January 1887, he died from peritonitis. He was survived by his wife.

<text>Ronald C. Packard (born January 19, 1931) is an American retired Republican politician from California who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001.

==Biography==
Ronald C. Packard was born and raised in Meridian, Idaho. He attended Meridian High School, Brigham Young University, Portland State University, and University of Oregon Dental School (now the Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of Dentistry), where he received a D.M.D. in 1957. He was in the Navy Dental Corps during 1957–1959, and worked as a dentist after leaving the navy.

Packard first entered politics as a trustee of the Carlsbad Unified School District in California, and served during 1962–1974. He was elected to the Carlsbad City Council in 1976, then elected Mayor of Carlsbad in 1978. While mayor, he was active in community and regional affairs, serving on the transportation policy committee of the League of California Cities, as a Director of North County Transit District, and as President of the Council of Mayors for San Diego County.

==1982 election==
In 1982, Packard lost the Republican primary for the United States House of Representatives in a crowded field of candidates to Johnnie R. Crean by 92 votes. Crean&#x27;s character came into issue, with his negative ads and false claim of endorsement by Ronald Reagan, so Packard launched a campaign as a write-in candidate. Packard ran a poll which found that voters would vote for him, especially if they knew how to write him in. Packard campaigned with a gigantic pencil as a prop while giving out golf pencils to district residents. An organized effort among fellow Mormons helped the campaign. Packard won the election by 11,000 votes to become the first independent write-in candidate to defeat candidates of both the Democratic and Republican parties. NPR&#x27;s Ken Rudin described the race this way:

Packard was only the third person to be elected to Congress as a write-in candidate, a victory later documented in &quot;Campaigns and Elections&quot; and due in part to the efforts of Russell Reed Benedict. The two previously successful congressional write-in candidates were U.S. Rep. Joe Skeen (R-New Mexico 2nd District) in 1980 and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) in 1954. Subsequently, Alaska Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski lost her party primary in 2010, but waged a successful write-in campaign against Joe Miller, the Republican primary winner and narrowly defeated him in the general election. Upon being sworn in, Packard joined the Republican caucus. He was reelected as a Republican eight times with little opposition in the heavily Republican district.

==Tenure==
Packard&#x27;s congressional career included membership on the House Appropriations Committee. Packard served a total of nine terms and then retired from the House at the end of his term in 2001 to spend time with his family. In Congress he was known as a deficit hawk, a critic of legislative &quot;pork&quot;, and opponent of illegal immigration. He was succeeded by Republican Darrell Issa.

==Retirement and private life==
A U.S. Post Office building in Oceanside, California was named for him in 2002.

Packard and his wife Jean live in Utah. They had seven children. Packard works part-time as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

The westernmost 16.6-miles of California State Route 78 between Interstate 5 in Oceanside, California and Interstate 15 in Escondido, California is designated Ronald Packard Parkway.

<text>Abaqa Khan (27 February 1234 – 4 April 1282, , &quot;paternal uncle&quot;, also transliterated Abaġa), was the second Mongol ruler (&quot;Ilkhan&quot;) of the Ilkhanate. The son of Hulagu Khan and Lady Yesünčin and the grandson of Tolui, he reigned from 1265 to 1282 and was succeeded by his brother Ahmed Tekuder. Much of Abaqa&#x27;s reign was consumed with civil wars in the Mongol Empire, such as those between the Ilkhanate and the northern khanate of the Golden Horde, and the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia. Abaqa also engaged in unsuccessful attempts at invading Syria under the Mamluk Sultanate, which included the Second Battle of Homs.

== Life ==
Abaqa was born in Mongolia on 27 February 1234, son of Ilkhanate founder Hulagu Khan. Abaqa was a Buddhist. A favoured son of Hulagu, he was made governor of Turkestan.

Hulagu died from illness in 1265. Before his death, he had been negotiating with the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to add a daughter of the Byzantine imperial family to Hulagu&#x27;s number of wives. Michael VIII had selected his illegitimate daughter Maria Palaiologina, who was dispatched in 1265, escorted by the abbot of Pantokrator monastery, Theodosius de Villehardouin. Historian Steven Runciman relates how she was accompanied by the Patriarch Euthymius of Antioch. Since Hulagu died before she arrived, she was instead married to Hulagu&#x27;s son, Abaqa. He received her hand in marriage when he was installed as Ilkhan. When Hulagu&#x27;s wife Doquz Khatun also died in 1265, the role of spiritual leader transferred to Maria, who was called &quot;Despina Khatun&quot; by the Mongols.

It was Abaqa who decided that the permanent location for the Ilkhanate capital would be Tabriz, which was in the northwestern grasslands that the Mongols preferred.

Abaqa took power four months after the death of his father, and then spent the next several months redistributing fiefs and governorships.

Some of the coins from Abaqa&#x27;s era display the Christian cross, and bear in Arabic the Christian inscription &quot;In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, only one God&quot;.

== Military campaigns ==
=== Golden Horde ===
Since Hulagu&#x27;s reign, the Mongols of the Ilkhanate had been at war with the Mongols of the Golden Horde. This continued into Abaqa&#x27;s reign, and the Golden Horde invaded the Ilkhanate in the spring after his accession. The invasion was partly due to an alliance between the Golden Horde and the Egyptian Mamluks. As part of this alliance, the Golden Horde attempted to distract Abaqa through attacks on his territories so as to keep him from invading Mamluk-held Syria. The hostilities continued until the death of the Golden Horde&#x27;s khan, Berke, in 1267. The Great Khan Kublai attempted to intervene to stop the civil war, and due to his influence, the Golden Horde&#x27;s new khan, Möngke Temür did not launch a major invasion into Abaqa&#x27;s territory. However, Möngke Temür still Commander Nogai established an alliance with the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Baibars promising that he would attack Abaqa and share any conquered territories. But, at the same time, Möngke Temür sent envoys to congratulate Abaqa when the Ilkhan defeated Ghiyas-ud-din Baraq. In 1270, he allowed Mengu-Timur to collect his revenues from workshops in Iran.

=== Chagataids ===
Ögedei&#x27;s grandson Kaidu, Batu&#x27;s grandson Mengu-Timur and Baraq of the Chagatai Khanate formed an alliance against Kublai Khan and Abaqa in Talas. They appointed Kaidu a ruler of Central Asia. The resulting Kaidu–Kublai war which started in 1268 would carry on until the end of the century.

In 1270, Baraq Khan of the Chagatai Khanate tried to annex Iran, which resulted in an attack on Abaqa who was in the city of Herat. However, Abaqa was able to launch a successful defence and also defeated Baraq&#x27;s relative Teguder in Georgia. In the following year, he retaliated by sending an army against the Chagatai Khanate. They plundered Bukhara and surrounding areas. There were small conflicts between Abaqha and the Qara&#x27;unas who were under the control of Chagatai nobles until 1280.

===Nizari Ismailis===
=== Invasions of Syria ===
==== Diplomatic relations with Christians ====
Abaqa was one in a long line of Mongol rulers who attempted to secure Western co-operation against the Muslim Mamluks. He corresponded with Pope Clement IV during 1267–1268, and reportedly sent a Mongol ambassador to western Europe in 1268, trying to form a Franco-Mongol alliance between his forces, those of the West, and those of his father-in-law Michael VIII. He received responses from Rome and from James I of Aragon, though it is unclear if this was what led to James&#x27; unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. Abaqa is recorded as having written to the Aragonese king, saying that he was going to send his brother, Aghai, to join the Aragonese when they arrived in Cilicia. Abaqa also sent embassies to Edward I of England, and in 1274 sent a Mongol delegation to Pope Gregory X at the Second Council of Lyons, where Abaqa&#x27;s secretary Rychaldus read a report to the assembly, reminding them of Hulagu&#x27;s friendliness towards Christians, and assuring them that Abaqa planned to drive the Muslims from Syria. But neither this diplomatic mission, nor two further embassies to Europe in 1276 and 1277, brought any tangible results.

==== Campaign during the Ninth Crusade (1271) ====
In 1260 Bohemond VI of Antioch was persuaded by his father-in-law, Hetoum I of Armenia, to voluntarily submit to Mongol authority while Abaqa&#x27;s father Hulagu was in power, making Antioch and Tripoli vassal states of the Ilkhanate. In 1268, the Mamluk leader Baibars captured Antioch, and Bohemond obtained a truce with Baibars in order to avoid losing Tripoli.

In response to the fall of Antioch, Edward I of England arrived in Acre in 1271, trying to lead a new Crusade. It was ultimately considered a military failure, but Edward was able to eventually secure a truce with the Mamluks before he had to return to England.

When Edward arrived in Acre, he had sent an embassy to Abaqa, led by Reginald Rossel, Godefroi of Waus and John of Parker, requesting military assistance from the Mongols. Abaqa was occupied with other conflicts in Turkestan but responded positively to Edward&#x27;s request, sending 10,000 Mongol horsemen under general Samagar from the occupation army in Seljuk Anatolia to Syria:

The Mongols, including some auxiliary Seljuk troops, ravaged the land from Aleppo southward. Though the force was relatively small, they triggered an exodus of the Muslim population (who remembered the previous campaigns of the Mongol general Kitbuqa) as far south as Cairo. Edward, for his part, was never able to muster his own forces to coordinate actions with the Mongols or even achieve any military victories, so Abaqa&#x27;s forces eventually withdrew. When Baibars mounted a counter-offensive from Egypt on 12 November 1271, the Mongols had already retreated beyond the Euphrates.

==== Campaigns of 1280–1281 ====
The Mamluk leader Baibars died in 1277. During 1280 and 1281, Abaqa promoted new attacks against Syria. In September 1280, the Mongols occupied Baghras and Darbsak, and took Aleppo on October 20. The Mongols sent envoys to Acre to request military support for their campaign, but the Crusaders were still in a 10-year truce with the Mamluks. The Vicar of the Patriarch declined Abaqa&#x27;s request, saying that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was embroiled in another war. The King of Cyprus Hugh III and Bohemond VII mobilised their armies, but could not intervene because the Mamluks had already positioned themselves between them and the Mongols.

Abaqa and Leo III urged the Franks to start a new Crusade, but only the Hospitallers and Edward I (who could not come for lack of funds) responded favourably. The Hospitallers of Marqab made combined raids into the Buqaia, and won several engagements against the Sultan Qalawun, raiding as far as the Krak des Chevaliers in October 1280, and defeating the Mamluk army of the Krak in February 1281.

The Mongols finally retreated, pledging to come back for the winter of 1281. They informed the Franks that they would bring 50,000 Mongol horsemen and 50,000 Mongol infantry, but apparently this pledge did not receive a response.

==== Campaign of Autumn 1281 ====

The Egyptian Muslims had respected a 10-year truce with the Crusaders which began in 1271. On 3 May 1281, the new Muslim sultan Qalawun signed a new 10-year truce with the barons of Acre and a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli, on 16 July 1281.

The announced Mongol invasion started in September 1281. They were joined by the Armenians under Leo III, and by about 200 Hospitalier knights from the fortress of Marqab who considered they were not bound by the truce with the Mamluks.

On 30 October 1281, 50,000 Mongol troops, together with 30,000 Armenians, Georgians, Greeks and the Frankish Hospitalier Knights of Marqab, fought against the Muslim leader Qalawun at the Second Battle of Homs, but were beaten back.

== Death and succession ==
Abaqa died at Hamadan on 4 April 1282, probably in a state of delirium tremens. This illness was probably caused by too much consumption of alcohol, a habit common to many Mongol leaders. However, in 1285, his minister of finance Shams ad-Din Juvayni was accused of having had him poisoned.

After Abaqa&#x27;s death, his widow Maria fled back to Constantinople where her father, apparently wishing to spare his capital the fate that befell Baghdad, tried to marry her off again to another Mongol khan. Maria would not accept the offer, became a nun, and in about 1285 founded the church of Panagia Mouchliotissa.

Abaqa was succeeded by his brother Tekuder, who despite his earlier conflicts with the Egyptian Mamluks, had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa&#x27;s pro-Christian policies and proposed an alliance with the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who resumed attacks on Frankish territory, capturing the northern fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and Tripoli in 1289. In 1284, Abaqa&#x27;s son Arghun led a successful revolt, backed by Kublai. Arghun had his uncle Tekuder executed and took power himself, returning to the pro-Christian policies of Abaqa.

A younger son, Gaykhatu, assumed the throne in 1291.

<doc id="975860" wikidata="Q3544600" url="?curid=975860" title="USS Scabbardfish">
<text>USS &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; (SS-397), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the scabbarddfish, a long, compressed, silver-colored fish found on European coasts and around New Zealand. In 1965 she was transferred to the Hellenic Navy and renamed Triaina.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Scabbardfish&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 September 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 January 1944, sponsored by Ensign Nancy J. Schetky, USNR, and commissioned on 29 April 1944.

==Service history==
===U.S. Navy===
====World War II====
After completing initial training at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and torpedo trials at Newport, Rhode Island, &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; reported to the Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic at New London, Connecticut, for advanced training and final outfitting. Upon completion thereof, she proceeded to Key West, Florida, for anti-submarine warfare duties which began on 21 June 1944. On 1 July 1944, she departed for Panama. Four days later, she transited the Panama Canal en route to the United States West Coast and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

&quot;Scabbardfish&quot;, as a unit of Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 24 July 1944. After completing voyage repairs and final training, she departed for Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 17 August 1944.

=====First war patrol=====

After refueling at Midway, &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; departed on her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the vicinity of the Ryukyu Islands. On 31 August 1944, she sighted her first enemy ships, a Japanese inter-island steamer with two escorts. &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; fired two spreads of three torpedoes, but all missed. After suffering a light depth charge attack, she surfaced and continued west.

On 19 September 1944, west of Okinawa, she damaged the 5,500-ton submarine tender with two torpedo hits. She also fired a spread of torpedoes &quot;down the throat&quot; of an approaching &quot;Chidori&quot;-class escort, but missed. As a consequence, she underwent a depth charge attack for three hours but suffered no damage. The remainder of her patrol proved fruitless, and she returned to Midway Atoll on 12 October 1944 for refitting.

=====Second and third war patrols=====

On 26 October 1944, &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; departed Midway Atoll for Saipan in the Mariana Islands for further orders. She departed Saipan on 12 November 1944 to patrol in the seas southeast of Honshū, Japan. She arrived in her patrol area on 16 November 1944 and sank a 2,100-gross register ton inter-island steamer that day. On 22 November 1944, she sank the 875-gross register ton merchant ship &quot;Kisaragi Maru&quot;, damaged a 4,000-gross register ton cargo ship, and sank the 407=gross register ton Japanese stores ship . On 29 November 1944, she sank the Japanese Type D submarine , picking up one lone survivor named Sasaki.

&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; completed her patrol at Guam on 20 December 1944. She remained there until 16 January 1945 and then proceeded to Saipan. Upon arrival there, she underwent intensive training in wolfpack tactics. Her third war patrol began on 23 January 1945, when she began patrolling the sea lanes between the Philippine Islands and Ryukyu Islands. In late February 1945, she engaged 12 luggers and a trawler with her deck gun but was forced to submerge by a Japanese plane. She was bombed but suffered no damage. She returned to Saipan on 6 March 1945 and was ordered to return to Pearl Harbor for refitting.

=====Fourth war patrol=====

&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; returned to Guam in late April and underwent voyage repairs by the submarine tender . On 29 April 1945, she departed for a patrol area in the East China Sea. A change of orders assigned her to lifeguard duty, and, on 4 May 1945, she rescued five crewmen from a ditched United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress. She transferred them to the submarine on 6 May 1945, then moved to the Yellow Sea area. On 17 May 1945, she fired a spread of torpedoes at a small Japanese cargo ship accompanied by two escorts. This proved to be a hunter-killer group, and when the torpedoes missed, they subjected &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; to a grueling four-hour depth charge attack. &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; sustained no serious damage and returned to Guam on 11 June 1945 to be refitted by the submarine tender .

=====Fifth war patrol=====

&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; began her fifth and last war patrol of World War II on 1 July 1945 with another assignment to the lifeguard duty. Between 25 July and 10 August 1945 she rescued seven pilots. She returned to Saipan on 15 August 1945, the day hostilities with Japan ended.

====Post-World War II====
=====1945–1948=====
&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; subsequently departed Saipan to proceed to Pearl Harbor. She got underway from Pearl Harbor on 6 September 1945 in company with the submarines , , and under orders which sent her to Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands for antisubmarine training duties. After parting company with the other three submarines on 13 September 1945, she proceeded alone to Eniwetok, which she reached on 15 September 1945 and where she relieved the submarine in training antisubmarine warfare forces. She remained at Eniwetok for a month, moved to Guam for a month and, on 14 November 1945, stood out of Apra Harbor, Guam, en route to San Francisco, California, via Midway Atoll. On 29 November 1945, she arrived at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, for her first overhaul, which was completed in mid-March 1946.

&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; operated along the U.S. West Coast until 17 March 1947, when she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for her second major overhaul. She departed directly from drydock on 8 August 1947 bound for San Diego, California. One month later, she called at Pearl Harbor for a few days and then continued west on a simulated war patrol. After visiting the Palau Islands, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tsingtao, and Okinawa, she returned to San Diego on 11 December 1947.

On 3 January 1948, &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; got underway for Mare Island Navy Yard and on 5 January 1948 reported to the Pacific Reserve Fleet for inactivation. In February 1948 she was berthed at Mare Island, and on 12 May 1948 she was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

=====Korean War=====
The Korean War broke out in June 1950, and on 31 January 1951 &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; was recommissioned, at a time when submarines increasingly were taking part in special operations, including amphibious raids and other clandestine missions. Based at Pearl Harbor, she conducted one Korean War deployment, from 31 July to 2 December 1952, during which she participated in reconnaissance missions and conducted two war patrols. In December 1952, when weather conditions required suspension of the Hokkaido-area patrols she took part in north of Japan, she was reassigned to special patrol duty off the coast of China. She received the Korean Service Medal for her operations during the Korean War.

=====1953–1964=====
The Korean War ended in July 1953, and &quot;Scabbardfish&quot; was decommissioned at Mare Island on 27 November 1953. She remained there until 24 October 1964, when she was again placed in commission, preparatory to transferring her to the government of Greece.

====Honors and awards====
&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

* Korean Service Medal

===Royal Hellenic Navy===
&quot;Scabbardfish&quot; was officially transferred on loan to Greece on 26 February 1965 and commissioned in the Royal Hellenic Navy as &quot;Triaina&quot; (S-86). She was stricken from the American Naval Vessel Register on 31 January 1976, and Greece purchased her outright in April 1976. She was decommissioned on 12 January 1979 and stricken from the Greek Navy in 1980, but remained in use as a pier-side trainer as late as 1982.

<doc id="975866" wikidata="Q725843" url="?curid=975866" title="Vittorino da Feltre">
<text>Vittorino da Feltre (1378February 2, 1446) was an Italian humanist and teacher. He was born in Feltre, Belluno, Republic of Venice and died in Mantua. His real name was Vittorino Rambaldoni. It was in Vittorino that the Renaissance idea of the complete man, or &quot;l&#x27;uomo universale&quot; — health of body, strength of character, wealth of mind — reached its first formulation.

==Biography==
He studied under John of Ravenna and at Padua under Gasparino da Barzizza. He later taught there, but after a few years he was invited by Gianfrancesco I Gonzaga, the marquis of Mantua, to educate his children. At Mantua, Vittorino set up a school at which he taught the marquis&#x27;s children and the children of other prominent families — both sons and daughters — together with many poor children whom he charged no fee, treating them all on an equal footing. He not only taught the humanistic subjects, but placed special emphasis on religious and physical education. Vittorino’s lessons in Greek and Latin, mathematics, music, art, religion, history, poetry and philosophy were so enjoyable that his school was known as La Casa Gioiosa, “The House of Joy”. It soon became famous all over Italy, and noble children from other cities came to Mantua to study with Vittorino. In fact, so many young nobles were educated at La Casa Gioiosa that it also came to be called the School of Princes.

He was one of the first modern educators to develop during the Renaissance. Many of his methods were novel, particularly in the close contacts between teacher and pupil as he had with Gasparino da Barzizza and in the adaptation of the teaching to the ability and needs of the child. He lived with students and befriended them in the first secular boarding school. Vittorino&#x27;s school was well lit and built of better construction than other schools of the time. Vittorino also made school work more interesting, adding field trips to his curricula. He watched the health of his students very carefully, and generally elevated the status of teachers. Schools throughout Europe (especially England) copied Vittorino&#x27;s model. Many of fifteenth century Italy&#x27;s greatest scholars, including Guarino da Verona, Poggio Bracciolini, and Francesco Filelfo, sent their sons to study under Vittorino da Feltre. Vittorino&#x27;s other students included Federigo da Montefeltro and Gregorio Correr. Theodorus Gaza improved his studies in Latin and was a scholar especially for Greek. After Vittorino&#x27;s death, Iacopo da San Cassiano took over direction of the school.

<doc id="975872" wikidata="Q3486564" url="?curid=975872" title="Slave (band)">
<text>Slave was an American Ohio-based funk band popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist Steve Washington, born in New Jersey, attended East Orange High School, and was one of the first users of the &quot;electric trumpet&quot;. He and Trombonist Floyd Miller formed the group in Dayton, Ohio, in 1975.

==History==
During late 1975 and spring of 1976, trombonist Floyd Miller teamed with trumpeter Steve Washington to form Slave. The original line-up included Tom Lockett Jr. (tenor and alto sax), Carter Bradley (keyboards), Mark Adams (bass), Mark &quot;Drac&quot; Hicks (lead and rhythm guitar, background vocals), Danny Webster (rhythm and lead guitar, lead and background vocals), Orion &quot;Bimmy&quot; Wilhoite (alto and tenor sax), and Tim &quot;Tiny&quot; Dozier (drums). They scored their first big hit with the single &quot;Slide&quot; in 1977 for Cotillion Records, which is the label they remained with until 1984. In 1978 Slave&#x27;s sound changed slightly when drummer/percussionist Steve Arrington, along with vocalists Starleana Young, Curt Jones,and keyboardist Ray Turner joined the band. Arrington ultimately replaced Miller and Webster as lead vocalist.

Other top ten R&amp;B hits were &quot;Just a Touch of Love&quot; in 1979, &quot;Watching You&quot; in 1980, and &quot;Snap Shot&quot; in 1981. They added Charles Carter on sax and brother Sam Carter on keyboards. Starleana Young, Steve Washington, Curt Jones and Lockett departed to form Aurra in 1981. Slave added Roger Parker, Delbert Taylor Jr., and Kevin Johnson as replacements. Arrington left in 1982 after the &quot;Showtime&quot; album to start his own band Steve Arrington&#x27;s Hall of Fame in which Charles and Sam Carter would also play. The band continued on, though not as successfully, into the mid-1990s.

The group moved to Atlantic Records for one LP (&quot;New Plateau&quot;) in 1984, then switched to the Atlanta-based Ichiban Records the following year, releasing &quot;Unchained at Last&quot; in late 1985. Despite scoring a couple of minor hits on the R&amp;B chart from this album the following year and another minor hit from their 1987 follow-up album, &quot;Make Believe&quot;, Slave could not recapture the commercial success they had enjoyed in their heyday. Rhino issued &quot;Stellar Fungk: The Best of Slave Featuring Steve Arrington&quot;, an anthology of their finest cuts, in 1994.

<text>Pall Mall (, or adopted) is a British brand of cigarettes produced by British American Tobacco.

== History ==

The Pall Mall brand was introduced in 1899 by the Black Butler Company (UK) in an attempt to cater to the upper class with the first &quot;premium&quot; cigarette. It is named after Pall Mall, a well-known street in the St James&#x27;s area of London, containing several of the private clubs which such people patronized.

In 1907, Pall Mall was acquired by the American Tobacco Company with the sale of Butler &amp; Butler. The new owners used the premium brand to test innovations in cigarette design, such as, in 1939, the &quot;king-size&quot; (now the standard size for cigarettes at 85 mm, although today that includes the filter length), and a new way of stuffing tobacco that supposedly made cigarettes easier on the throat.

Pall Mall reached the height of its popularity in 1960 when it was the number one brand of cigarette in America. Capitalising on their popularity, the company introduced &quot;longs&quot;, 100 mm long cigarettes in 1966. It was edged out in 1966 by Winston cigarettes, when Pall Mall found that it could no longer compete with the advertising campaign &quot;Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.&quot; In the 1940s, Pall Mall had its own grammatically incorrect slogan which touted it as the cigarette which &quot;travels the smoke further&quot;, referencing the longer 85 mm length. Their slogan during the &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s was &quot;OUTSTANDING...&quot;and&quot; they are MILD!&quot;

In 1994, Pall Mall and Lucky Strike were purchased by Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation as the former American Tobacco company shed its tobacco brands. In 2001 Pall Mall was re-branded as a savings brand, and introduced several varieties of filtered cigarettes. Brown &amp; Williamson merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company on July 30, 2004, with the surviving company taking the name of the latter. Reynolds continues to make unfiltered and filtered styles of Pall Mall for the U.S. market, emphasizing the latter. British American Tobacco makes and sells Pall Mall outside the U.S.

Pall Mall currently is in the &quot;Growth Brand&quot; segment of the R. J. Reynolds brand portfolio. Within British American Tobacco, Pall Mall is one of their four drive brands. During the Great Recession, Pall Mall was marketed as a &quot;premium product at a sub-premium price&quot;, which pushed the product from a 1.95 percent market share with a 1.6 billion quarterly volume in 2006 to 7.95 percent and 5.5 billion in third quarter 2010. 
Pall Mall is now Reynolds&#x27; most popular cigarette, along with Newport and Camel. In October 2012, Reynolds debuted two new versions of its menthol cigarette, Pall Mall Black, described as &quot;full flavor&quot;, and Pall Mall White, called &quot;smoother&quot;. The traditional menthol style is called Pall Mall Green.

==Logo==

The Pall Mall logo has large Art Nouveau lettering spelling out &quot;Pall Mall&quot; on the top front of the red pack. On the face is a white coat of arms on the front and back of the package. Showing two regal lions pawing the sides and a knight&#x27;s helmet on top. There is a banner underneath the shield that holds another Latin phrase, &quot;In hoc signo vinces&quot; or &quot;By this sign shall you conquer&quot;. The Pall Mall slogan, &quot;Wherever Particular People Congregate&quot;, appears beneath the coat of arms.

In 2007, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company changed the packaging color of Pall Mall Ultra Lights from light blue to orange to stop confusion between the Ultra Lights and the Lights. Both had been in blue colored packaging.

In 2009, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company changed the flavor descriptors of all the Pall Mall brand hard packs to color designations. The descriptor change occurred because the FDA banned product descriptors such as &quot;Light,&quot; &quot;Ultra Light&quot; and &quot;Mild&quot; in 2010. Along with the change in descriptors, the rings and branding on the cigarettes have changed to match both the color of the box and the Pall Mall lettering on the filter for that particular descriptor. The soft packs are still sold with the traditional style packaging and design.

In 2015, the FDA required that two varieties of Pall Mall be removed from stores, Deep Set Recessed Filter (blue) and Deep Set Recessed Filter Menthol, as well as Camel Crush Bold and Vantage Tech 13.

== Pronunciation ==

During the era of cigarette advertising on television and radio, the American pronunciation of the brand was . However, after the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned cigarette advertising, the American pronunciation shifted to , which is the pronunciation of the street in London of that name and has always also been used for the cigarettes by smokers from the United Kingdom. Older smokers in the U.S. who heard the commercials often still use the older pronunciation.

==Sponsorships==
Pall Mall sponsored the radio shows &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; in the 1940s and &quot;The Big Story&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s.

The brand was the sponsor of &quot;M Squad&quot;, a television program which ran on NBC during the late 1950s. Lee Marvin, the show&#x27;s star, appeared on its commercials during the episodes. It was an alternating sponsor of &quot;MGM Parade&quot; in the 1955–56 season. Despite the ban on cigarette ads on TV that went into effect on January 2, 1971, Pall Mall ads from the show are seen on Turner Classic Movies intact.

== Cultural references ==
* Kurt Vonnegut, who was a Pall Mall smoker, mentioned the brand in several of his novels. Kurt Vonnegut once said that smoking was &quot;a classy way to commit suicide&quot;. In the introduction to his book &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House: The Special Edition&quot;, Vonnegut said &quot;My brand is Pall Mall. The authentic suicides ask for Pall Malls. The dilettantes ask for Pell Mells.&quot;
* In 1973’s Badlands (film), Kit (Martin Sheen) is surprised to realize that Holly (Sissy Spacek) smokes Pall Malls. Pronouncing it “Pell Mells”

<doc id="975891" wikidata="Q846911" url="?curid=975891" title="Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu">
<text>was a Japanese samurai of the Edo period. He was an official in the Tokugawa shogunate and a favourite of the fifth shōgun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. His second concubine was Ogimachi Machiko, a writer and scholar from the noble court who wrote monogatari.

==Career==
The Yanagisawa house traced descent to the &quot;Kai-Genji,&quot; the branch of the Minamoto clan which had been enfeoffed with the province of Kai in the eleventh century. 

Yoshiyasu served Tsunayoshi from an early age, becoming his &quot;Wakashū&quot; and eventually rose to the position of &quot;soba yōnin&quot;. He was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Kawagoe han, and later of the Kōfu han in Kai Province, a signature honour as it has been the fief held by Tsunayoshi before becoming &quot;shōgun&quot;, and of Ienobu, his heir apparent, as well as having an historic familial connection; he retired in 1709. Having previously been named Yasuakira, he received a kanji from the name of the shōgun, and came to call himself Yoshiyasu. He built Rikugien Garden, a traditional Japanese garden, in 1695. He had an adopted son named Yanagisawa Yoshisato by Tokugawa Tsunayoshi with Yoshiyasu&#x27;s concubine, Sumeko.

Yanagisawa played a pivotal role in the matter of the forty-seven rōnin.

==Cultural references==
Yanagisawa is the subject the diary memoir of his concubine Ōgimachi Machiko (正親町町子, 1675 - 1724), Matsukage no nikki (&#x27;In the Shelter of the Pine&#x27;), which gives a detailed account of Yoshiyasu&#x27;s glory during the period 1685-1709 modelled on the Eiga Monogatari and in a writing style inspired by The Tale of Genji. More than 36 hand-copied manuscripts survive to the present day. An English translation appeared in 2021.

Yanagisawa appears as a character in most of the novels by American mystery writer Laura Joh Rowland set in Genroku-era Japan as the antagonist to the books&#x27; main character Sano Ichiro. Rowland&#x27;s chronology differs from history by having Yanagisawa exiled in disgrace in 1694 and being replaced by Sano as Tsunayoshi&#x27;s chief advisor, only to return from exile later in the series. Other details of Yanagisawa&#x27;s life, however, are portrayed fairly accurately, including his relationship to the shōgun.

<doc id="975895" wikidata="Q506553" url="?curid=975895" title="Olympiodorus of Thebes">
<text>Olympiodorus of Thebes (; born c. 380, fl. c. 412–425 AD) was a Roman historian, poet, philosopher and diplomat of the early fifth century. He produced a &quot;History&quot; in twenty-two volumes, written in Greek, dedicated to the Emperor Theodosius II, detailing events in the Western Roman Empire between 407 and 425. The history is lost, but much of it is known from its use by other writers.

His friends included philosophers, provincial governors and rhetoricians. He made several journeys in an official capacity, accompanied for twenty years by a parrot. He was a &quot;convinced but discreet&quot; pagan,
who flourished in a Christian court, and whose work influenced several subsequent historians, including writers of ecclesiastical history.

==Life==
Olympiodorus was born between 365 and 380 in Thebes (modern Luxor, Egypt), in the Roman province of Thebaïd, into a curial family. Thebes at that point was a flourishing centre of literary learning, and a cradle of politicians and public figures. He received a classical education, learning Greek and Latin, as well as the vernacular Coptic. This education provided access to a career in public life.
He went to study philosophy at Athens around 385-90, at about fifteen, and would have stayed there for four years. It was probably at Athens that he made friends with the sophist Leontius and the grammarian Philtatius, whose knowledge of the amount of glue to use in book-binding caused a statue of him to be erected at Athens. Another friend, Valerius, was governor of Thrace in 421, and may have been the son of Leontius and brother of the future Augusta Eudocia.

After his studies, he seems to have returned to Thebes, where there was a thriving community of poets writing in Greek, and embarked on the poetry that came to define him. At this time, according to Treadgold, he may have married and adopted a son, possibly an orphaned relative. Around 399/400 he acquired a pet parrot, his faithful companion for the next twenty years, which spoke beautiful Greek and could &quot;dance, sing, call its owner&#x27;s name, and do many other tricks&quot;.
At some point he moved, with his family and parrot, to Constantinople, where he established himself at the court of Theodosius II, enabled by his classical education. (Latin was the language of official business, and proficiency in this language was necessary, even in the east, for any important government appointment.) He probably also benefitted from his connection with the future Empress.
During his several journeys over the next thirteen years, he recorded a wide variety of facts, statistics, geographical observations, etymological musings, and opinions on the political situation in the west.

==Travels==
His first recorded visit was on an embassy to the Huns in 412/3. Olympiodorus discourses about 
: &quot;Donatus and the Huns, and the skilfulness of their kings in shooting with the bow. The author relates that he himself was sent on a mission to them and Donatus, and gives a tragic account of his wanderings and perils by the sea. How Donatus, being deceived by an oath, was unlawfully put to death. How Charaton, the first of the kings, being incensed by the murder, was appeased by presents from the emperor.&quot;

A school of thought says that he was sent by the Western Roman Emperor, but Treadgold finds this implausible, all the evidence pointing to Olympiodorus&#x27; living in, and working for, the eastern Empire during his professional life. During this journey, Olympiodorus learned sufficient Hunnish to include some technical terms in his writing. He also picked up a few words of Vandal, telling us that the Vandals called the Goths &quot;Truli&quot;, because, when pressed by famine, they bought a &quot;trula&quot; of wheat for a gold coin, though it was only one third of a pint.

Around 416, he went on a visit to Athens. There, through his &quot;support and efforts&quot; he caused his friend Leontius to be installed in the Chair of Rhetoric at the University (a position that Leontius apparently did not want). This was perhaps to settle a dispute between rival candidates, ensuring the choice of the Emperor. Or to support an official programme of copying classical texts following Visigothic invasions. He gives a vivid account of the student rituals in the city:
:&quot;All newcomers (novices), young and old, were taken to the public baths. Those who were by age fit to wear the cloak were brought forward by the scholastics who escorted them; then, while some ran in front pushed them back, others, running behind, pushed them forward and resisted them, amid shouts of &#x27;Stop, stop, he must not wash.&#x27; Those who pushed back those who tried to hinder the progress of the novice were considered to be victorious in the contest. After a considerable time, and after a long disputation had taken place in accordance with custom, he who was being escorted was taken into a warm room and washed. Having dressed himself, he received permission to wear the cloak on his way from the bath, being accompanied by a numerous and distinguished throng.&quot;

In the same year (416), and probably as part of the same trip, he visited the oases of the Egyptian desert. His description of the journey ends with the assertion that Homer&#x27;s family were natives of the Thebaïd. The official purpose of the visit may have been to gather information about the Blemmyes of Nubia, a group of barbarians living south of the Great Oasis and the Thebaïd, who frequently raided both.

In about 419/20, he undertook an actual mission to the Blemmyes, probably in his official capacity. He gives another account of a harrowing sea-voyage: 
:&quot;While talking of a marvellous star (called Urania by the sailors), he was leaning heavily against the mast, which nearly gave way and precipitated him into the water.&quot;

His parrot seems to have perished, as his writing at this time contains what looks like an obituary. At the border town of Syene (now Aswan), a request was sent to the ethnarchs (leaders) of the Blemmyes, requesting permission to meet them. They referred the decision to their &quot;prophets&quot;, who applied divination to the question, and decided in favour of allowing Olympiodorus into their territory: they &quot;were eager to meet him owing to his reputation.&quot; He was urged to visit the emerald mines of the Pharaohs, but official permission was withheld. This is read as the local kings&#x27; refusal, in Freese&#x27;s translation of Photius, but Treadgold thinks it much more likely that it was the Emperor&#x27;s decision: Olympiodorus was commissioned to travel for five days and no further, and the emerald mines could obviously not be reached within this time. (As further evidence, Treadgold points out that Olympiodorus uses the word &quot;basileus&quot; (βασιλεύς), the proper title of the Roman Emperor, to refer to the withholder.) On his return journey, he stopped off at his native Thebes, where he learned of the death of his son. He continued his journey to Alexandria, where he met his friend Hierocles.

His final recorded journey was to Rome in 424/5, in the company of the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; Helio, for the installation of the six year old Valentinian III as Western Emperor, in place of the usurper Johannes (423-5). Though there is no direct evidence that Olympiodorus went on this trip, there are several compelling reasons to think he did: his detailed knowledge of affairs since 407; his observations on the coastline of Italy; the citing of facts and statistics that would have been available in the city archives at Rome; and his amazement at the actual grandeur of Rome and the wealth of its aristocracy. One hexameter, presumably his own, appears in the description of the residences of the wealthy on his visit to Rome, which contained hippodromes, fountains, shrines, and many of the other attributes of a town: 
: &quot;One house is a town; a city has ten thousand towns&quot; (Εΐς δόμος ά συ πέλει πόλις ά οτεα μυρία κεύθει)

==Writing==

The history itself is now lost, but many of its structures and features can be established from the works of other writers. Its twenty-two books were organised into two &quot;decads&quot;. The first started with an account of Stilicho&#x27;s career from 395, with the history proper beginning in 407, and ended (in Book X) with the voyage to the Huns in 412. The second decad began with events in Gaul that can be dated to the same year (412), and ended with the expedition to Rome for Valentinian&#x27;s installation in 425.

The &quot;history&quot; dealt almost exclusively with the Western Empire, and provides much of what we know of its affairs in the early fifth century (particularly around 410 when Rome fell to the Visigoths). Events in the east are only introduced when they impacted on affairs in the West, or were relevant to Olympiodorus himself. He describes eastern affairs in western terms: Theodosius II is the &quot;nephew of Honorius and Placidia&quot; (the western Emperor and his sister), as well as the son of Arcadius (the eastern Emperor).

He provides detailed chronologies, using consular dating: the usurpation of Constantine III, in 406, is given as “before the seventh consulship of Honorius and the second of Theodosius”, and the whole history covers the period from the seventh consulship of Honorius to the accession of Valentinian III. We are told that the marriage of Placidia and the Goth Ataulf occurred in the month of January, and her marriage to Constantius III was in the eleventh consulship of Honorius and the second of Constantius.

Though written in Greek, the work included many Latinisms, including inscriptions and acclamations in the Roman alphabet: eg. the response to Stilicho&#x27;s request to the Senate for the money to pay off Alaric I: (&quot;This is not a peace, but a bond of servitude&quot;). Or the cry of the starving population in the Circus Maximus, faced with a grain blockade from Africa, exploitation by the grain merchants, and the prospect of eating each other: (&quot;Fix a certain price on human flesh&quot;). Olympiodorus “jestingly” suggests that the name (soldiers) derives from the (dry bread, biscuit) which they ate.

He gave distances in Roman miles (), as well as stades: eg. (Rimini), “thirty miles from Ravenna”.; or “two hundred and ten stadia distant from Ravenna”. Olympiodorus transliterated every Roman title into Greek, an unusual practice: Greek historians avoided transliteration, often by leaving out the officials&#x27; titles altogether.

The &quot;history&quot; includes detailed accounts of people, eg. his account of Constantius III: 
:“Constantius, as he rode along, had a dejected and sullen appearance, with his great eyes and neck and broad head; his whole body was bent over his horse and he looked askance on either side, in order as the old expression has it, “to appear worthy of empire.” At feasts and banquets, however, he was agreeable and sociable, and often even condescended to vie with the mimes who performed at table.”

The accuracy of personal details was often corroborated: Stilicho&#x27;s nemesis, “the cruel and inhuman Olympius”, is described as a pious Christian; this is confirmed by letters from Saint Augustine of Hippo. He narrates the motivations of various characters with clarity, showing how they manoeuvered through the volatile political landscape of the times. The &quot;history&quot; provided statistical and cultural details: eg. the sizes of armies; “the emperor called ten thousand Huns to his assistance in the war against Alaric”; the buying-off of Alaric, in which the city agreed to “give five thousand pounds of gold, and thirty thousand of silver, four thousand silk robes, three thousand scarlet fleeces, and three thousand pounds of pepper”; the relative sizes of the baths (there were 1600 seats in the Antonine baths, and twice that number in the Baths of Diocletian). Olympiodorus was able to calculate the annual income of Roman senators, and the immense sums spent by them during their, and the families’, public offices.

It also showed a predilection for gruesome details: “Olympius, who intrigued against Stilicho.. is beaten to death by order of Constantius, the husband of Placidia, after his ears have first been cut off”; the heads of usurpers (Jovinus and his brother Sebastian, Constantine and his son Julian, Maximus and Eugenius) are exposed outside Carthage; Attalus, city prefect of Rome, declared Emperor by Alaric “is captured, and, after the thumb and forefinger of his right hand have been cut off, is banished”.

Above all, the work had a “distinctly geographical bias”, with “even the geography of poets...pressed into... service”. Events were often narrated topographically (a practice shared with Ammianus Marcellinus).In his account of his trip to the Blemmyes, there are digressions on the weather, wells, agriculture and fossils. Olympiodorus concluded, from the fossil remains, that the Great Oasis of Siwah had once been an island. He gives detailed accounts of the routes taken by Alaric and Stilicho on various campaigns, mentioning rivers, towns, distances and features of the landscape.

Though Olympiodorus was a Pagan, the work was &quot;carefully neutral&quot; on religious issues, (apart from some references to the disastrous effects of removing pagan statues). He was capable of even-handedness towards people, praising the Gothic general Sarus for his bravery and skill in battle, but denouncing him as an oath-breaker. Though emperors are generally mentioned with respect, he depicted Honorius as an oath-breaker (Honorius had promised safe passage to Constantine III and his son, but then had them executed), but praised his arrangement with the Visigoth Ataulf, whereby the latter defeated the rebel Jovinus in 413. Surprisingly, in the political context of the times, Olympiodorus spoke positively of Stilicho, and disapproved wholeheartedly of his execution by Honorius. He could also take unfavourable views of individuals: for instance, the pious Olympius, whom Olympiodorus regarded as a traitor, while other writes regarded him as a ‘public benefactor’. He did not like Galla Placidia, telling us that her second husband, the emperor Constantius III, was “generous and open-handed” till he married her, after which he descended into &quot;parsimonious ways&quot;..

The work has been seen as a piece of travel-writing, in which the wandering poet goes in search of “themes, patrons and rewards”; however, Matthews points out that the style is more in keeping with an official document, designed to inform and make policy recommendations based on the situation in the west. Olympiodorus himself described the work as “a collection of materials for a history”, (),

Gillett tells us that holders of public office in antiquity often assembled such materials so that they, or others, could use them as the basis for a history. Thompson points out that Olympiodorus’ idiosyncracies of style: the Latinisms, slang (vernacular Greek), statistics and dating systems, which did not have to conform to the conventions of contemporary historical writing, were appropriate for such a work.

==Date of writing==

Scholarly debate places this from soon after the last events described, in 425, to close to 450. Thompson is an advocate of an early date (427 at the latest), as Olympiodorus gives a favourable account of “the most noble” general Boniface, declared a public enemy in 427 by Placidia. (However, in 432 Boniface was back in favour and was awarded the title Patrician, which makes possible a later date of publication.

433 is supported by the fact that Sozomen&#x27;s &quot;HE&quot; breaks off at this point; it is also the accepted date of publication of Philosturgius’ Ecclesiastical History, though this is disputed. Gillett opts for a later date, about 440; with a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of 450, when Theodosius II, its dedicatee, died. He reasons that the church historian Socrates, whose HE breaks off in 439, shows no signs of having used Olympiodorus, and that as Socrates read widely of the available literature, it is likely that Olympiodorus’ work had not been published by then. Gillett also offers, as evidence of a date of publication of 450, the “common and prudent practice” among historians to refrain from writing about events in the reigns of living emperors. Another possibility is that the work was published in sections, with the first decad having been written any time after the marriage of Placidia and Constantius in 417 (as they are therein referred to as married). The work may have been written to deadline.

==Sources==
Olympiodorus had access to a wide variety of sources and used many research techniques. He was widely read in prose and poetry.. He was aware of Ammon, who had measured the walls of Rome in the early 5th century. He quoted Asinius Quadratus, citing him extensively on geographical matters. He mentions the poet Peisander, whom he credits with providing the connection between the Argonauts and the founding of Emona.
Thompson suggests that Olympiodorus had read and digested Ammianus Marcellinus: the works of the two historians being similar in scale, and in their use of geographical and social detail. It is possible to see the influence of Thucydides and Plutarch in the history., and the poet Claudian has been suggested as a source. A source with which Olympiodorus would have been familiar was the ‘’History to Continue Dexippus’’ of Eunapius, which ended in 404 and dealt primarily with the eastern empire. Treadgold suggests that “to some extent”, Olympiodorus could be seen as a continuator of Eunapius, though their styles and attitudes were very different: Olympiodorus, as we have seen, provided detailed chronology; Eunapius thought chronological accuracy was irrelevant in a history.

It has been suggested that Olympiodorus used a single written source for his history, but Matthews rejects this because of the personal digressions contained in his writing: he points out that, though such digressions were considered an integral part of the work of ancient historians, it would have been hard to insert them seamlessly into an existing narrative. As further evidence for Olympiodorus&#x27; having brought his sources together into his own narrative, Treadgold mentions the similarities of composition and outlook between his accounts of events in the west and accounts of his activities in the east.

Though obtaining accurate information about the Western Empire was notoriously difficult, there was an increase in diplomatic and political activity between east and west after 408, which would have provided Olympiodorus, moving in court circles, with first-hand information about the latter. There were also refugees, fleeing Rome after its sack: “it would be perverse to assume that none reached Constantinople”.

Olympiodorus would have met several people who contributed to recent history on his travels, whose opinions he endorsed, and which made their way into his history. These included the ambassador Jovius, sent to treat with Honorius by Alaric and the usurper Constantine III, and Candidianus, adviser to the Visigothic king Athaulf, who allied himself with Placidia and the eastern government in its war with the usurper Johannes (423-5). and who may have contributed to Olympiodorus’ favourable account of Boniface,

Justinianus, a former adviser to Stilicho, was a possible source of information, whence Olympiodorus’ positive account of the Vandal, which was unique in eastern or western circles. (Matthews asserts that, given the generally unfavourable view of Stilicho by contemporary historians and senators, Olympiodorus&#x27;s favourable view could only have come from his supporters). Another was the imperial notary, John, who held various offices under official and usurping masters up to 422, and who was a friend of the besieger of Rome, the Visigoth Alaric. Heliocrates, appointed confiscator of Stilicho&#x27;s partisans by Honorius, who carried out his job so moderately that he had to seek sanctuary from the emperor in a church,was another possible informant. The sometime Praetorian Prefect, Palladius, who had the task of raising Alaric&#x27;s tribute from the aristocracy in 408, was another possible source, and may have provided Olympiodorus with his knowledge of public and private wealth. His unfavourable account of Galla Placidia mirrors those of commentators in the western Empire, where Placidia was not popular.

His detailed account of Roman statistics were most probably gleaned from the city&#x27;s archives, which Olympiodorus could, as a government official, have accessed on his visit for the installation of Valentinian III (assuming he went; his description of Rome and his amazement at the splendour of the city was &quot;almost&quot; certainly &quot;based on autopsy&quot;).

Olympiodorus also drew on personal experience: for instance, his account of the student initiation rites in the baths of Athens, which were unlikely to be public, is so detailed it suggests that Olympiodorus had participated in them. He learned enough of barbarian customs and language to comment on their tribal structure. The story of the silver statues (below) was told to him by Valerius, given as governor of Thrace (who may have been the son of his friend Leontius, and brother of Eudocia Augusta).

==Influence==
Originally, the intended readership of the &quot;history&quot; may have been small, perhaps restricted to the emperor, his wife and sister, and his principal advisers. However, it was used and paraphrased by several other writers.

Sozomen, a near contemporary, wrote his Ecclesiastical History (also dedicated to Theodosius II) in the 440s. Though not the most prolific user of the history, he provides some details not found in other works, and is closer in style to the original, often preserving Olympiodorus’ details, and Latinisms, by straightforward transcription of Latin characters into Greek. Sozomen switches his emphasis from the East to the West when he follows Olympiodorus, and his narrative becomes more precise. The last book (Book IX), which uses Olympiodorus as a source for a large part of it, led Matthews to note that Sozomen seems to forget he is writing an ecclesiastical history, and becomes “almost secular”. Sozomen notes the powers of Stilicho, but does not present Olympiodorus’ favourable view of him, merely mentioning (twice) that he was killed by soldiers in Ravenna.

Sozomen tells of the besieging of Rome by Alaric, and mentions “certain Tuscans, who… promised to drive out the barbarians with thunder and lightning; they boasted of having performed a similar explit at Larnia”.. He refers to Alaric&#x27;s blockade of Rome, and says that “some persons were suspected of having partaken of human flesh”. He tells us that Jovius, prefect of Italy, held a conference with Alaric, after which he presented Alaric&#x27;s demands to Honorius. (When the emperor refused to put Alaric in charge of the army, Sozomen tells us that Jovius thought it prudent to side with Honorius “compelling the principal officers to swear that they would never consent to any terms of peace with Alaric.”) Sozomen refers to the three usurpers in Britain at this time (Mark, Gratian and Constantine III), and gives an account of the latter&#x27;s adventures on the continent.

Zosimus, writing his &quot;New History&quot; at the turn of the fifth and sixth centuries, provides the fullest version of Olympiodorus&#x27; &quot;history&quot;, though he used only one fifth of it, and omitted some details used by Sozomen. Initially his history, based on the work of Eunapius, concentrated on the Eastern Empire; however he switched to the west, paraphrasing Olympiodorus, who was “the almost exclusive source” for his last chapters (Chapters 5.6-6.13). Zosimus maintains Olympiodorus&#x27;s practice of providing geographical detail, giving distances in Roman miles, and a chronology using consular dating:
:”the Vandals, uniting with the Alani and the Suevi, crossed&quot; the Alps in “the three passes, which form the passage from Italy into Celtica, commonly termed the Cottian, the Pennine, and the Maritime Alps…Arcadius being in his sixth consulate and Probus was his colleague”: A &quot;report had been circulated at Rome, that the emperor Arcadius was dead, which was confirmed after the departure of Arcadius for Ravenna. Stilico being at Ravenna while the emperor was at a city of Aemilia, called Bononia, about seventy miles distant&quot;.

In the sections taken from Olympiodorus, Zosimus preserves his Latinisms, with Latin words, phrases and sentences appearing in the Greek text (with a Greek translation). Matthews notes the improvement in quality when Zosimus follows Olympiodorus, eg. in the accuracy of titles and personal details. He draws particular attention to the change in attitude towards Stilicho in Zosimus’ work: Eunapius was extremely hostile to the Vandal, which is reflected in the first references to him in the &quot;New History&quot;, which report that, through bribery, money flowed into the coffers of Stilicho (and his eastern equivalent, Rufinus); when Zosimus switches to Olympiodorus, this changes to a more sympathetic account: “He was the most moderate and just of all the men who possessed great authority in his time…he never conferred military rank for money, or coveted the stipend of the soldiers to his own use.” Zosimus cites Olympiodorus once, the subject being the naming of Ravenna. Olympiodorus asserted that it took its name from Remus, who founded it with his brother Romulus, while Zosimus preferred the explanation given by Asinius Quadratus, that it was named for &quot;Rhene&quot; (water). Zosimus mentions Jovius, as does Sozomen, but in his account Jovius is sent to Honorius by Constantine III (rather than Alaric, if it is the same Jovius) to offer him an alliance. He names the British usurpers at this time, and gives a more detailed account than Sozomen of Constantine&#x27;s campaign in Gaul

The ninth-century patriarch, Photius, excerpts the history in his &quot;Biblioteca&quot; (the section pertaining to the history is known as the 46 Fragments of Olympiodorus, twelve of which have no historical content). Photius was a careful reproducer of the language and mannerisms of the authors he excerpted, and much of Olympiodorus&#x27;s style survives in his work. From Photius we know of the organisation of the history, and it is he who tells us that Olympiodorus referred to himself as a poet. The Fragments stick closely to the Latin names of titles: the young Valentinian receives the title &quot;Nobilissimus&quot;; Jovian remains with Attalus as his &quot;Patricius&quot;, and it is from him we learn the names of Olympiodorus’ friends. Photius decries Olympiodorus&#x27;s style: 
:“His style is clear but loose and wanting in vigour, and sometimes degenerates into commonplace vulgarity, so that the work does not deserve to be considered a history… He is not distinguished for form, except… that he now and again approaches simplicity; but even in this, owing to the excessive meanness and paltriness of his diction, he… gradually descends to vulgar mannerism”.

The ecclesiastical historian, Philosturgius, whose work appeared between 433 and 440, is believed to have had access to Olympiodorus’ entire work.. Evidence for this is “complex and debatable”, as the work of Philosturgius is accessible only via an epitome of Photius. The final book of Philosturgius’ Ecclesiastical History (Book Twelve) covers the same ground as does the ‘’history’’, and ends with the same episode (the defeat of the usurper John and proclamation of Valentinian III as western Emperor. There are linguistic similarities between the work of Philosturgius and the relevant passages of Zosimus that suggest Olympiodorus as a common source. The Baldwins offer a list of details suggesting a connection between the respective fragments of the two authors, though their attitudes towards Stilicho were very different.

Philosturgius mentions Alaric&#x27;s blockade of Rome and the ensuing famine, and says that those Romans who “had not been devoured by each other” were granted permission to bring in corn by Alaric, after he had declared Attalus emperor. 
One passage in Philosturgius concerns the aforementioned Olympius, the destroyer of Stilicho: “Others call this man not Olympius but Olympiodorus; and they relate not that he came to the assistance of the emperor, but that he laid plots against Stilicho, who deserved well at his hands, and falsely accused him of aiming at the empire”. As Olympiodorus tells us that Stilicho&#x27;s adversary was Olympius, Baldwin &amp; Baldwin suggest that “something could easily have gone wrong with a sentence containing two such similar names”

In addition, Treadgold suggests that fragments of Olympiodorus survive in the Wars of Procopius.

It was not just other writers who were influenced by Olympiodorus. His philosopher friend Hierocles, whom he visited at Alexandria after his visit to the Blemmyes and the death of his son, was so moved by the contrast between his successful mission and his tragic loss that he was moved to write ‘’On Providence and Fate, and the Relation of What We Control to the Divine Power’’, which he addressed and sent to Olympiodorus to console him.. In the preface to this book (summarised in Photius), Hierocles refers to Olympiodorus’ skills and successes as a Roman ambassador.

The work was an official document, and contained Olympiodorus&#x27; professional opinions and policy recommendations. He advocated conciliating barbarians, which he considered often to be preferable to opposing them. He blamed Honorius for failing to win over Alaric, either by acceding to what he considered his &quot;reasonable demands&quot;, or dealing successfully with his threat.

Olympiodorus advocated support for the western empire by the East, highlighting the detrimental effects of earlier conflicts between the emperor Arcadius and Stilicho. Gillett describes his work as “a monument to the vitality of the belief in the unity of the Roman Empire under the Theodosian dynasty”. Gillett notes the commitment of time and resources expended by Constantinople to support Ravenna in the face of the aggressive Vandal presence in north Africa, and suggests that Olympiodorus’ work provided a &quot;timely contribution&quot; to the debate. In the end, Gillett asserts that the history, rather than a record of events for posterity, or a religious polemic, was a realistic assessment of affairs of state.

==Paganism==

Photius refers to Olympiodorus as a “heathen”, which may have denoted a “dynamic cultural tradition” rather than a “specifically religious commitment”. Olympiodorus was addressing a Christian court, but there was a certain amount of tolerance for pagan ideas: both Theodosius II and the Empress Eudocia were patrons of Hellenistic learning. He felt able to assert that pagan cult objects could help the empire if they were respected (and hinder it if they were not). He credits the downfall of Stilicho and his wife to their plundering of pagan temple treasures, and blamed the Romans’ capitulation to Alaric on their having melted down a statue of &quot;Virtus&quot;, who then abandoned Rome. 
In Sozomen&#x27;s account of the Tuscans who offered to call up a storm to save Rome from Alaric, they assert that their town was saved by “the devotion of its inhabitants to the gods, in the ancient mode of worship”. The Prefect took the suggestion to the Bishop of Rome, who gave permission for the pagan rites to be carried out in private. However, the visitors attested that their rites would have no power unless they were done in full view of the public, and so were sent away. Olympiodorus regarded the professed Christian piety of the “impious wretch” Olympius as incompatible with his public office, and applauds the principled refusal of the general Generidus, who resigned his position in protest at a law prohibiting pagans from holding office. He made ‘sour’ comments about the wealthy Anicii family, who were unhappy at the prospect of losing their near monopoly of the city&#x27;s wealth after Attalus&#x27;s appointment of officials “well acquainted with the management of affairs”: Baldwin &amp; Baldwin suggest that his attitude was due to the Anicii being Christian, rather than to their wealth alone. Olympiodorus suggests that Attalus incurred the wrath of the gods by his arrogant words to the Senate &quot;in which he told them with great ostentation that he would subdue the whole world to the Romans, and even perform greater things than that&quot;.

Thompson refers to the “great attraction” of Neoplatonism at the time, and suggests this was an early influence on Olympiodorus. However, he did not allow his religious beliefs to cloud his impartiality: he took a dim view of the neoplatonist thaumaturge (magician) Libanius, who promised to repel a barbarian incursion using magic, without the aid of soldiers, but who was put to death by order of Placidia in 421.

His journey to Athens in 416 is prefaced by a tale of three statues that had been interred near Thrace:
:&quot;three statues of solid silver were found, lying in barbaric guise, with arms akimbo, clothed in part-coloured barbaric raiment, with long hair, turned towards the north, the country of the barbarians. When these statues were removed, the Goths a few days afterwards first overran and ravaged Thrace, and a little later Huns and Sarmatians made inroads into Illyricum and Thrace itself, for these consecrated districts lay between Thrace and Illyricum, and from the number of the statues consecrated, they appear to have been intended as a protection against these barbarous nations”.

Treadgold is sceptical about these statues, finding the dates and personnel involved impossible to reconcile. Another fragment details a statue, endowed with a magic spell, which stood at Rhegium (&quot;Reggio Calabria&quot;), and which protected Sicily from the fires of Mount Etna (&quot;Aetna&quot;) and from barbarians attempting to cross the Strait of Messina. To this statue Olympiodorus credited the failure of Alaric to invade Sicily in 410. When the statue was pulled down on the orders of Placidia and Constantius III, Mt Etna erupted, and barbarians invaded Sicily (between 417 and 421).

<text>Alfred Ludlam (1810 – 8 November 1877) was a leading New Zealand politician, horticulturist and farmer who owned land at Wellington and in the Hutt Valley. A member of three of New Zealand&#x27;s four earliest parliaments, he was also a philanthropist and a founder of Wellington&#x27;s Botanic Garden.

==Birth in Ireland==

Born in or near the town of Newry, County Down, Ireland, Ludlam lived for a while in the West Indies before coming to New Zealand, where he would spend the rest of his life apart from visits to Australia and England. (Little is known about Ludlam&#x27;s early activities in Ireland or the West Indies but a preserved specimen of the common iguana, collected by him on Tobago, is listed in an 1845 British Museum catalogue of lizards.)

== Career in New Zealand ==

Alfred Ludlam, aged 30, arrived at Wellington on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island on 12 December 1840 from Gravesend in England. He is listed as a &quot;cabin passenger&quot; aboard the 700-ton emigrant vessel &quot;London&quot;, which sailed under the auspices of the New Zealand Company. (The company had formed in London the previous year with the purpose of promoting the orderly colonisation of New Zealand by British settlers.) He prospered in his new homeland, proving an energetic, intelligent and highly capable settler who proceeded to play an active role in the Wellington region&#x27;s civic and cultural life. He assisted the Lower Hutt militia during the New Zealand Wars, which pitted the British colonists against the indigenous Māori tribes. He served in the militia as Captain Ludlam from July 1860 onwards.


In 1853 voters elected Ludlam and Edward Gibbon Wakefield (formerly one of the directors of the New Zealand Company) to represent the electorate of Hutt in New Zealand&#x27;s first Parliament, which opened in Auckland on 24 May the following year. Ludlam would also be elected as a member of the second Parliament and the fourth Parliament, representing Hutt in 1853–55 (resigned 9 July), 1855–56 (resigned 16 August) and 1866–70 (retired). He resigned his seat before the conclusion of both the 1st and 2nd Parliaments.

In addition, Ludlam was elected to represent the Hutt Valley on the Wellington Provincial Council in 1853–56 and again in 1866–70. His propensity for straight-talking inhibited his ability as a deft political operator but it did earn him the respect of his parliamentary colleagues and his constituents. He was nicknamed &quot;Old Bricks&quot; because of his solid, reliable character and stern appearance. Taller than average in height, he sported mutton-chop whiskers and a monocle during his time in public life.

During the 1850s and 1860s, Ludlam&#x27;s political and social activities brought him into occasional contact with the uncle of his wife—the English-born baronet and former Barbados sugar planter Sir Samuel Osborne-Gibbes. Sir Samuel (1803–1874) was a prominent Freemason and a landed proprietor at Whangārei, in the far north of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. He was a Legislative Councillor from 1855 to 1863, impressing Ludlam with the strength of his belief in &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; community service and his advocacy of high ethical standards.

Ludlam became a notable landed proprietor. His holdings included real estate in Ghuznee Street, Wellington (town sections 169 and 171), and he owned a substantial riverside farm at Waiwhetū in Lower Hutt, where he ran flocks of sheep and developed a reputation as an expert in horticulture. He had purchased the Waiwhetū farm from fellow-pioneer Francis Molesworth in the mid-1840s, calling it &quot;Newry&quot; after his home town in Ireland. Ludlam built a large house at Newry in 1848, replacing the farm&#x27;s first homestead. The farm also boasted an orchard, a spacious barn often used for public functions (such as an official dinner held for the governor, Sir George Grey, in 1851) and a stone windmill that Molesworth had erected in 1845.

In 1860 Ludlam imported the first Romney Marsh sheep from England into New Zealand, instituting a successful ovine breeding programme at a purpose-built stud at Newry. (His brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, conducted a similar Romney Marsh breeding programme at his Australian sheep property, Yarralumla (the present-day site of Australia&#x27;s Government House in Canberra), during this same period). Ludlam also opened a beautiful landscaped garden at Newry in 1868. He called it &quot;The Gums&quot; as a tribute to Australia&#x27;s native eucalyptus trees, which he had studied. (After Ludlam&#x27;s death the area was renamed McNabb&#x27;s Gardens and later converted into the Bellevue Pleasure Gardens.)

Ludlam supported the Wellington Colonial Museum and was one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the Wellington Botanic Garden in 1869, having introduced into the New Zealand Parliament legislation to &quot;establish and regulate&quot; the garden. He also introduced an act of parliament which entrusted management of the Botanic Garden to the New Zealand Institute (forerunner of the Royal Society of New Zealand). His contribution to the garden&#x27;s establishment is commemorated on the site by the pedestrian thoroughfare known as Ludlam Way.

A year after the Botanic Garden was established by means of a Crown Grant (dated 22 November 1869), Ludlam acted as a pallbearer at the funeral in Wellington of the Māori chief Honiana Te Puni, after whom the Lower Hutt suburb of Epuni takes its name.

==Marriage in Australia==

Ludlam was a periodic visitor to the Australian colony of New South Wales. The main reason for these trans-Tasman visits of Ludlam&#x27;s was to do business in the City of Sydney, which served as New South Wales&#x27; principal trading port, population centre and seat of government. One of the businessmen with whom he dealt was Thomas Sutcliffe Mort—an industrialist, pastoralist and pioneer of the frozen-meat trade.

Ludlam also found time to socialise while in Sydney and, on 1 October 1850, he married into Sydney&#x27;s colonial establishment. The marriage was solemnised at St Thomas&#x27; Anglican Church, North Sydney by Ludlam&#x27;s friend, the clergyman-scientist William Branwhite Clarke, and his bride was Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Minto Gibbes. Fanny (1822/23-1877) was the third daughter of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes and the Colonel&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth (née Davis). London-born Colonel Gibbes (1787–1873) was a senior government official and a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars. He had been head of the New South Wales Customs Service since 1834 and occupied a Crown-nominee&#x27;s seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council.

Then aged in her late 20s, Fanny was living with her parents at Wotonga House—nowadays part of Admiralty House complex on Sydney&#x27;s Kirribilli Point—at the time of her marriage to Ludlam. She and her husband spent their honeymoon relaxing at a rural New South Wales property, Yarralumla, which belonged to Fanny&#x27;s brother-in-law, (Sir) Terence Aubrey Murray. Following their honeymoon, the Ludlams left Australia for New Zealand, making the farm at Newry their marital nest. This move, however, almost proved to be a fatal mistake: on 23 January 1855, the Wairarapa earthquake destroyed Newry homestead, and the Ludlams narrowly escaped being crushed to death when a brick chimney in the living room collapsed around them. After the earthquake, as the Ludlams waited for Newry to be made habitable again, they went to live with the New Zealand politician and landowner (Sir) David Monro, who owned a farm at Nelson. Still extant is a vivid description of the earthquake and its destructive impact on the Wellington region, written by Alfred Ludlam to Sir David in a lengthy private letter dated 8 March 1855.

Ludlam was devoted to his wife. Cultured and well read but the possessor of an irreverent sense of humour, Fanny could speak several languages and was an amateur artist and musician of above-average competence. She also liked to garden on a serious scale, providing her husband with vital help in the completion of his various horticultural projects at Newry. Although she was a dozen or so years Ludlam&#x27;s junior she nonetheless predeceased him, succumbing to a painful &quot;stoppage of the bowel&quot; on 5 March 1877. She and Ludlam happened to be staying in London, at 2 Clifton Terrace, Maida Vale, when she died, and her death notice was duly published in the New Zealand press and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; of 4 May 1877.

==Final illness, death and burial==

Following the loss of Fanny, a despondent Ludlam returned to New Zealand. He had developed a chronic kidney ailment, and sensing that his days were now numbered, devoted himself to helping needy people and supporting good causes. Ludlam died at a house in Hobart Street, Wellington, on 8 November 1877 and was buried four days later in Bolton Street Cemetery. His death certificate (registration number 1877/2787) ascribed the cause of his demise to &quot;Bright&#x27;s disease&quot; (an old-fashioned term for nephritis) and &quot;acute peritonitis&quot;.

Ludlam was aged 67 when he died. The final phase of his life had been devoted to charitable works, and his death was sincerely mourned by a wide circle of friends, acquaintances and beneficiaries. He was not survived by any children and his grave was destroyed during the 1960s by the construction of the Wellington Urban Motorway. His gravestone was relocated and can be found near the Bolton Street Chapel. An official photograph of him is preserved, however, in the archives of the library of the New Zealand Parliament in Wellington. Ludlam Street in the Wellington suburb of Seatoun, Ludlam Street in the Wairarapa town of Featherston and Ludlam Crescent at Lower Hutt perpetuate his name.

<doc id="975900" wikidata="Q261700" url="?curid=975900" title="Ghosts of Mars">
<text>Ghosts of Mars (titled onscreen as John Carpenter&#x27;s Ghosts of Mars) is a 2001 American action horror film written, directed and scored by John Carpenter. It was produced by Screen Gems and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It stars Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Clea DuVall and Joanna Cassidy. Set on a colonized Mars in the 22nd century, the film follows a squad of police officers and a convicted criminal who fight against the residents of a mining colony who have been possessed by the ghosts of the planet&#x27;s original inhabitants.

&quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; received mostly negative reviews and was a box office bomb, earning $14 million against a $28 million production budget. The film would be John Carpenter&#x27;s last until his return with &quot;The Ward&quot; in 2010.

&quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; has received a cult following since its release, with critics praising the action sequences, soundtrack and blending of genres. Given the film&#x27;s debt to Western cinema, particularly the works of Howard Hawks, it has been considered by a number of critics as an example of the Weird Western subgenre.

==Plot==
Set in the year 2176, Mars has been 84% terraformed, giving the planet an Earth-like atmosphere. Martian society has become matriarchal, centering on the city of Chryse, with smaller outposts connected by an expansive network of trains. In the wake of a series of mysterious &#x27;incidents&#x27;, Police Officer Melanie Ballard is called before a tribunal to give testimony following a disastrous mission to the remote mining outpost Shining Canyon to retrieve convicted felon James &#x27;Desolation&#x27; Williams, of which she is apparently the sole survivor.

Through a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks as new perspectives are incorporated into the narrative), Ballard recounts details of the mission. Accompanied by commanding officer Helena Braddock, cocky sergeant Jericho Butler and rookie officers Bashira Kincaid and Michael Descanso, Ballard arrives at Shining Canyon to find the town seemingly deserted. Investigating the local jail, Braddock discovers a trio of individuals who appear to have sealed themselves into one of the cells; among them science officer Dr Arlene Whitlock.

Ballard and Butler find a number of disoriented miners and the convict Williams, who has escaped. The group is attacked by several of the miners, causing Ballard and Williams to band together and incapacitate them. Ballard is forced to shoot and kill one of them, causing the affliction to be passed on to one of the three survivors. Butler, venturing out to the edge of town in pursuit of one of the feral miners, discovers a row of severed heads mounted on spikes, including the head of Commander Braddock and a large assembly in the canyon below committing horrific acts of self-mutilation and ritualistic execution.

Friends of Williams arrive and force Ballard and Butler to release him. While they originally plan on leaving the officers and remaining miners to die, Ballard convinces them to work together to survive. Their initial effort to escape is halted when the army of feral miners converge on their position, killing, injuring and infecting several of them. Confronted by Ballard, Whitlock eventually explains that she fled from her post after discovering an ancient underground vault created by an extinct Martian civilization. When the door to the vault was opened, it released hostile spirits or &quot;ghosts&quot;, which took possession of the workers, causing their violent behavior. Killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another host. Ballard surmises that these Martian spirits believe humans to be an invading race. Ballard is briefly possessed until Butler feeds her a hallucinogenic drug, which forces the Martian spirit to leave her body.

The group is forced to flee as the possessed workers breach the jail, leaving only Ballard, Williams, Butler, Kincaid and Whitlock left alive. While they are able to make it to the train, Ballard realizes that they have a duty to exterminate the Martian threat and decide to return to Shining Canyon to overload the outpost&#x27;s nuclear power plant, assuming that the ensuing atomic blast will vaporize the spirits. While they are able to initiate the meltdown, Whitlock is possessed, while Butler, Kincaid and the two train operators are killed. Boarding the train, the two watch as the army is engulfed in the explosion. Williams tends to Ballard&#x27;s wounds. Unwilling to face the authorities, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and leaves. She moves to shoot him, but realizes her respect for him and lets him escape.

Resting after her trial, Ballard is woken by an alert that the city is under attack. Realizing their attempt to destroy the spirits failed, she readies herself to face the onslaught alone until she is greeted by Williams, who hands her a weapon. The two agree to fight their way out of the city together.

==Production==
It has been widely reported that the script to &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; originally started off as a potential Snake Plissken sequel. However, this rumor has been publicly dispelled by the film&#x27;s producer, Sandy King Carpenter.

Michelle Yeoh, Franka Potente and Famke Janssen were the first choices for the role of Melanie Ballard, but they turned it down. Courtney Love was originally cast, but she left the project. Natasha Henstridge replaced her by the suggestion of her boyfriend Liam Waite. Jason Statham was originally going to play Desolation Williams, but he was replaced by Ice Cube because the producers needed some star power for the part, and Statham instead played the character of Jericho Butler.

Although Mars has a day/night cycle almost identical in length to Earth&#x27;s, most of the film is set at night. Mars is shown only once in the daytime, in a flashback when a scientist describes how she found and opened a tunnel, unleashing the alien spirits.

Filming began on August 8, 2000, and ended on October 31, 2000. Production had to be shut down for a week when Henstridge fell ill due to extreme exhaustion, as she had just done two other films back-to-back before joining production at the last moment.

Much of the film was shot in a New Mexico gypsum mine. The pure white gypsum had to be dyed with gallons of food coloring to recreate the red Martian landscape.

==Release==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; received mostly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 23% based on 111 reviews with the consensus stating &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; is not one of Carpenter&#x27;s better movies, filled as it is with bad dialogue, bad acting, confusing flashbacks, and scenes that are more campy than scary.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a schlocky, sluggish shoot-em-up&quot;, giving the film one star out of five, and later listing the film as the third worst film of the year. Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film one star out of five, saying: &quot;&quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; is a muddled, derivative, and embarrassing disaster straight on through.&quot; Bruce Fretts of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said about the film &quot;...it&#x27;s distressingly amateurish and hackneyed to the point of absurdity,&quot; further adding &quot;it&#x27;s dishearting to see the &#x27;master of horror&#x27; bring himself to both write and direct a film with such a prepubescent understanding of horror&quot;. James Berardinelli gave the film 1.5 stars out of four. Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com suggested that the film was symbolic of &quot;Carpenter at rock bottom&quot;. According to press reviews, factors contributing to the box office failure of the film included &quot;poor set designs, hammy acting and a poorly developed script&quot;.

Conversely, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film three stars out of four, writing: &quot;&quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; delivers on its chosen level and I enjoyed it, but I wonder why so many science-fiction films turn into extended exercises in Blast the Aliens...this is an instance where it works.&quot; Richard Roeper also awarded the film three stars out of four, saying: &quot;is it stupid? Certainly. I think that&#x27;s the point. Carpenter is a smart man and he knows exactly what he&#x27;s doing. I miss seeing campy action flicks like this at the drive-in.&quot; David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz, film critics for &quot;The Movie Show&quot;, both awarded the film three stars out of five. In his review, Stratton made the following observation: &quot;John Carpenter doesn&#x27;t seem to have moved forward from the 70s and early 80s, when he made his best films. Though it&#x27;s not terribly exciting, &quot;Ghosts Of Mars&quot; does have a marvelously skewed vision and can deliver genuine morbid laughs when it wants to.&quot;

Ice Cube was very critical about the movie: &quot;I don&#x27;t like that movie. I&#x27;m a big fan of John Carpenter and the only reason I did it was because John Carpenter directed it but they really didn&#x27;t have the money to pull the special effects off.&quot; Natasha Henstridge is more fond of the movie: “I loved the experience of making the film. It was just brilliant“, she said. “I really loved making the film because I’d just had a young kid and now I get to train all the time and do all this kickboxing and martial arts and all of that, and being a chick action star is pretty cool; it’s pretty kick-ass. That part of it, I loved it! That part was pretty awesome.“ She also enjoyed working with John Carpenter: “I loved John! John’s a hoot and I just love him; a great sense of humor, a great guy. Really loved working with him.“

Responding to the criticism towards the film, Carpenter stated he was intentionally trying to make &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; as over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek as possible. He claimed he was trying to make a mindless and silly, yet highly entertaining and thrilling, action flick where &quot;the universe allows its characters and plot points to be silly without becoming full-fledged comedies&quot;, akin to 80s movies like &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot;. Looking back on the film and its criticism, he stated he was frustrated that most people thought the film was meant to be a serious horror movie, and feels that he should&#x27;ve made the film more openly comedic and &quot;in on the joke&quot;, saying &quot;I have no power over what critics say, but when people complained about the movie being campy and not scary...the name of the movie is &quot;Ghosts Of Mars&quot;, I figured the campiness would be self-explanatory.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened at No. 9 in the North American box office in its opening weekend (8/24-26) with $3,804,452, grossed $8,709,640 in the North American domestic box office, and $5,301,192 internationally, totaling $14,010,832 worldwide. On a budget of $28 million, &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; was a box office disappointment.

==Soundtrack==

For the film&#x27;s soundtrack, John Carpenter recorded a number of synthesizer pieces and assembled an all-star cast of guitarists (including thrash metal band Anthrax, virtuoso Steve Vai, genre spanning Buckethead, and former Guns N&#x27; Roses/current Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck) to record an energetic and technically proficient heavy metal score. Reaction to the soundtrack was mixed; many critics praised the high standard of musicianship and the strong pairing of heavy metal riffs with the film&#x27;s action sequences, but complained about the overlong guitar solos, the drastic differences between the cues used in the film and the full tracks and the absence of any of the film&#x27;s ambient synth score from the soundtrack CD.

==Style==
Their songs are composed of intricate (and in the beginning of their career, dueling) guitars heavily influenced by Drive Like Jehu. They initially signed with Level Plane in 2003.

<doc id="975906" wikidata="Q6929281" url="?curid=975906" title="Mr. Whipple">
<text>Mr. George Whipple (also known as George the Grocer) is a fictional supermarket manager featured in television commercials, radio, and print advertisements that ran in the United States and Canada from 1964 to 1985 for Charmin toilet paper. Typically, Whipple scolds customers who &quot;squeeze the Charmin,&quot; while hypocritically entertaining such actions himself when he thinks no one will notice. The character and catchphrase were created by John Chervokas of the agency Benton &amp; Bowles. Prominent ad-man Sid Lerner also worked on the campaign.

The first commercial featuring Mr. Whipple set the tone of the advertising campaign, which &quot;Advertising Age&quot; designated as among the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century. Whipple is seen looking around the corner of the supermarket (either he is at the checkout or stocking shelves) at a female customer, commenting that first she is squeezing the tomatoes, then the melons, and then (in a classic comic &quot;triple&quot;) when she arrives at the Charmin, he cannot contain himself and approaches her, uttering his famous plea &quot;Please don&#x27;t squeeze the Charmin!&quot;

&quot;Mr. Whipple&quot; was played by Dick Wilson, a character actor who also appeared in many TV sitcoms during the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1964 and 1985, Wilson appeared as Whipple in more than 500 commercials for Charmin.

In some commercials, Mr. Whipple was accompanied by a stock boy named Jimmy, played by Adam Savage, known decades later for the television series &quot;MythBusters&quot;. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a competing grocer named Mr. Hoffmeier appeared in Charmin commercials as well. However, Hoffmeier &quot;encouraged&quot; his customers to squeeze the Charmin, and he scolded Whipple on his hypocrisy. By the late 1980s, Mr. Whipple was encouraging customers who weren&#x27;t buying Charmin to squeeze it. One commercial featured him using a fishing rod to place the product in a skeptic&#x27;s shopping cart.

In 1999, after a 14-year hiatus, Mr. Whipple returned in various Charmin commercials involving why he could not retire, with the answer being that he had to inform the public about Charmin. A later series of commercials featured him with the new slogan, &quot;Is Mr. Whipple watching?&quot; In 2000, Procter &amp; Gamble presented Wilson with a lifetime achievement award as a subsequent advertising campaign began for Charmin that features Charmin Bears, a family of anthropomorphic cartoon bears.

Wilson died of natural causes on November 19, 2007, at the age of 91, in California. Soon after, on November 28, 2007, a new Charmin commercial debuted on television, featuring old clips and paying tribute to Dick Wilson and Mr. Whipple. The tribute indicated that the deceased actor will be &quot;In Our Hearts Forever.&quot;

== In culture ==
According to a 1970s survey, Mr. Whipple topped then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter as the most recognizable face in North America. According to Charmin makers Procter &amp; Gamble, a 1978 survey found that Mr. Whipple was the third best-known American, behind former President Richard Nixon and evangelist Billy Graham.

The country song &quot;Don&#x27;t Squeeze My Sharmon,&quot; which was a Top 10 hit for Charlie Walker in 1967, was inspired by the advertising campaign for Charmin.

In 1985, the lyric &quot;You better squeeze all the Charmin you can when Mr. Whipple&#x27;s not around&quot; was included in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;.

The catchphrase &quot;Don&#x27;t squeeze the Chermin&quot; was used in the 1986 comedy film &quot;Short Circuit&quot; when the main protagonist - Number 5 - defeats one of his sibling robots by causing him to crash into an outhouse.

In 2001, the lyric &quot;Shake junt staring, I don&#x27;t mean no harmin&#x27;/Call me Mr. Whipple cause I want to squeeze the Charmin&quot; was included in the Project Pat song &quot;Ooh Nuthin&quot;.

In 2006, the lyric &quot;You can call me Mr. Whipple, I won&#x27;t do no harmin&#x27;/Never to the Charmin, come holla at me woman&quot; was included in the Project Pat song &quot;Good Googly Moogly&quot;.

Adam Savage, who portrayed Whipple&#x27;s stockboy Jimmy in several commercials, paid tribute to Whipple on Savage&#x27;s show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, showing a vintage Charmin commercial which features Savage. On an episode of the final season of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, Savage also dressed in a stockboy uniform, a likely nod to Savage&#x27;s work with Charmin commercials.

<text>Vampires (also known as John Carpenter&#x27;s Vampires) is a 1998 American horror-action film directed and scored by John Carpenter and starring James Woods. It was adapted from the novel &quot;Vampire$&quot; by John Steakley.

Woods stars as Jack Crow, the leader of a team of vampire hunters. After his parents were murdered by vampires, Crow was raised by the Catholic Church to become their &quot;master slayer&quot;. The plot is centered on Crow&#x27;s efforts to prevent a centuries-old cross from falling into the hands of Jan Valek (a reference to Valac, played by Thomas Ian Griffith), the first and most powerful of all vampires. The film also stars Daniel Baldwin as Tony Montoya, Crow&#x27;s best friend and fellow hunter; Sheryl Lee as Katrina, a prostitute who has a psychic link to Valek after being bitten; Tim Guinee as Father Adam Guiteau; and Maximilian Schell as Cardinal Alba.

The film was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;&quot; (2002) and &quot;&quot; (2005).

==Plot==
Jack Crow leads his team of Vatican-sponsored vampire hunters in a daylight raid on an abandoned house in New Mexico. Finding a &#x27;nest&#x27; of vampires, the team subdue the creatures with gunfire, pikes, and wooden stakes, using a modified crossbow attached to a mechanical winch to pull them outside, where they are incinerated by sunlight. Despite disposing of nine basic vampire &#x27;goons&#x27;, Jack is concerned about not having found the nest&#x27;s &#x27;master&#x27; — an older and more powerful vampire.

While the team drunkenly celebrates with prostitutes at a local motel, the master vampire, Valek, arrives and bites one of the prostitutes, Katrina, initiating her transformation into a vampire. He swiftly murders the hunters, with only Crow and his trusted lieutenant Tony Montoya escaping alive with Katrina. Disturbed that Valek recognized him by name, Crow orders Montoya to lie low with Katrina, hoping to use her growing psychic link with Valek to track him down.

After burying his team and burning down the motel, Crow reports to his superior, Cardinal Alba, who confirms that Valek was a disgraced priest who led a rebellion against the church, leading to his execution and transformation into the first vampire. Valek has already killed another group of slayers in Germany, and Alba instructs Crow to form a new team, accompanied by archivist Father Adam Guiteau. Suspecting that his team was betrayed, Crow interrogates Guiteau and dispels his heroic notions of vampire hunting, showing him a map of vampire activity which indicates the vampires are searching the southwest for an unknown object.

Guarding Katrina at a hotel, Montoya explains the changes she is experiencing. Horrified, she attempts suicide and bites Montoya when he rescues her, which he hides from Crow and Guiteau when they arrive. Crow decides to pursue Valek without gathering a new team, and Katrina is linked with Valek when he questions and kills a priest. Sensing Guiteau is hiding something, Crow threatens him, recounting that he killed his own father for being bitten by a vampire and killing Jack&#x27;s mother in front of him. Guiteau reveals that Valek is seeking an ancient relic, the &quot;Black Cross&quot; of Béziers, and Crow welcomes him to the team as his new slayer.

Using Katrina&#x27;s psychic link, Jack, Montoya, and Guiteau learn that Valek has roused seven additional masters. They follow the vampires to a Spanish mission, where Valek has slaughtered the monks and seized the cross. Guiteau realizes that Valek plans to complete his own exorcism, making him immune to sunlight and virtually unstoppable. Searching a nearby abandoned town, they suspect at least fifteen new goons have been transformed. Guiteau volunteers as &#x27;bait&#x27; for the masters, allowing Jack to harpoon them and Montoya to drag them into the sunlight. While they manage to kill most of his lieutenants, Valek and his undead army overwhelm them at sundown; Crow is captured, Guiteau takes cover and Montoya flees with Katrina, only for her to fully transform and bite Montoya on the throat before joining Valek.

Cardinal Alba reveals himself as Valek’s ally; having grown to fear death, he has agreed to help Valek recreate the original ritual in exchange for becoming a vampire himself. The ritual requires the participation of a priest and the blood and crucifixion of a &quot;crusader&quot; — Jack. Guiteau kills Alba before he can complete the ritual and holds off the vampire horde by threatening to kill himself which would leave Valek without a priest. Montoya and Guiteau rescue Crow as the sun rises, and Crow confronts Valek, impaling him with the Béziers Cross before destroying him in daylight.

Guiteau and Crow prepare to slay Montoya and Katrina, knowing their transformations are irreversible. However, to repay Montoya’s two days of loyalty after being bitten, Crow grants them a two-day head start. As Montoya and Katrina depart, Jack and Guiteau head off to kill the remaining vampires.

==Production==

Largo Entertainment bought the rights to John Steakley&#x27;s novel in 1992 and planned on turning the film into the studio&#x27;s next big project. Although Carpenter, alongside Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson, and Ron Underwood, had all been considered, Russell Mulcahy was the first to be the attached director. Dolph Lundgren had been cast in the lead role of Jack Crow, and it was reported that Willem Dafoe was being eyed for a secondary role, likely the role of antagonist vampire Valek. Many proposed drafts for the film existed, including one that took place entirely at The Vatican and featured a vampirized Pope as the villain, and another that took place in a distant high-tech future where vampires are commonplace and vampire hunters are as abundant as police officers. The film was slated for a Summer 1996 release date with a budget of $50–$60 million, but conflicts between Mulcahy and the studio forced him to leave the project before filming began, taking Lundgren with him. The two would immediately begin working on &quot;Silent Trigger&quot;, which borrowed elements from the unused scripts for &quot;Vampires&quot;.

Shortly after finishing work on &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, John Carpenter was thinking about quitting filmmaking because &quot;it stopped being fun&quot;. Largo Entertainment approached him with a project called &quot;Vampires&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Steakley. They gave him two screenplays; one by Don Jakoby and one by Dan Mazur. Carpenter read both screenplays and the novel, and he saw the potential for a film he&#x27;d been interested in making. &quot;I went into my office and thought, &#x27;It&#x27;s going to be set in the American southwest and it&#x27;s a western – Howard Hawks.&#x27;&quot; Carpenter had always wanted to make a film that experimented with mixing the horror and western genres, and felt &quot;Vampires&quot; was perfect for him. &quot;The story is set up like a western. It&#x27;s about killers for hire. They&#x27;re a western cliché. In this movie they’re paid to kill vampires.&quot; In terms of tone and look, Carpenter felt that his film was &quot;a little more like &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; than Hawks in its style, but the feelings and the whole ending scene is a kind of replay on &quot;Red River&quot;.&quot;

The film was originally set to be made with a budget $60 million, but was slashed down to $20 million at the last minute. To accommodate the sudden budgetary concerns, he wrote his own screenplay, taking elements from the Jakoby and Mazur scripts, the book, and some of his own ideas, alongside writer and frequent collaborator Michael De Luca. For this film, Carpenter wanted to get away from the stereotype of gothic vampires as he said in an interview, &quot;My vampires are savage creatures. There isn&#x27;t a second of brooding loneliness in their existence. They&#x27;re too busy ripping and tearing humans apart.&quot;

===Casting===
Carpenter was looking for someone unique to play the character of Jack Crow and was actively avoiding &quot;just another musclebound meathead&quot;, eventually settling for James Woods. He had considered Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and R. Lee Ermey for the role, but all of those actors either declined the role or couldn&#x27;t sign on due to scheduling conflicts. Ermey&#x27;s casting was rejected by the studio, who believed he did not hold the star power to front a blockbuster. Carpenter cast James Woods as Jack Crow because he wanted &quot;the vampire slayer to be as savage as the prey he&#x27;s after, a guy who&#x27;s just as menacing as the vampires. James Woods is the kind of guy you&#x27;d believe could and would chew off the leg of a vampire.&quot; Woods was interested in doing the film because he had never been offered a horror film before and wanted to try something new. Contrary to his reputation, Carpenter didn&#x27;t find the actor difficult to work with because &quot;we had a deal. He would give me one take as it&#x27;s written and I would let him improvise...Many of his improvisations were brilliant. When I needed him to be more focused and disciplined, I had the take from the script that was straighter.&quot;

Alec Baldwin, an outspoken fan of Carpenter&#x27;s work, had been cast to play Montoya but quickly dropped out and recommended the role to his brother, Daniel. Carpenter had not seen any of Daniel Baldwin&#x27;s work and had the actor read for him. He had seen Sheryl Lee on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and cast her based on her work on the show. Carpenter&#x27;s wife and the film&#x27;s producer Sandy King cast Thomas Ian Griffith because she and the director wanted &quot;someone who looks formidable, but is also alluring. There always has to be something alluring about the evil nature of the vampire.&quot; Dolph Lundgren was also approached about returning as Valek instead of Jack Crow, but he was not interested in playing the villain and declined.

===Filming and post-production===
Principal photography began during June 1997 in New Mexico and concluded on August 4, 1997. Midway through production, Carpenter left the film due to creative interference, and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero took over for a few days until Carpenter was persuaded back. In the credits, the film bears a 1997 copyright year rather than a 1998 copyright year, presumably because post-production work had been completed prior to 1998.

The MPAA took issue with the film&#x27;s over-the-top violence, threatening to give it an NC-17 rating unless some of the gore was cut. Ultimately, about 20 seconds of footage was cut from the film. King said, &quot;We satisfied the ratings board by just cutting short of a few things that went into really gruesome stuff.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at #1 but dropped to #8 on its second week. The film grossed $20,308,772 in the United States on a $20 million budget. Although worldwide numbers are not official, Carpenter stated the film was a massive success overseas, particularly in Japan, and pulled in well over its $20 million budget. It later went on to pull in a further $42 million on home video rental and purchase sales. &quot;Vampires&quot; was Carpenter&#x27;s only financially successful film of the 90s, and to date it is the last financially successful film that John Carpenter has directed.

===Critical response===
The film was originally released to varied critical reviews, appearing on both best-of-the-year and worst-of-the-year lists. Positive reviews were based on the film&#x27;s acting, direction, and visual style, while negative reviews felt the film lacked a coherent plot or likable characters. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Vampires&quot; holds a 44% rating based on 54 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus was: &quot;Nothing but one showdown after another.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 42% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;D+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In its positive reviews, Liam Lacey of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it &quot;crude, rude, nasty fun&quot;. Robert Gonsalves of efilmcritic.com gave the film four out of five stars, calling &quot;Vampires&quot; &quot;grungy, disreputable fun — the kind of blood-and-tequila western that can only be made nowadays when disguised as a horror movie.&quot; Sean Axmaker of &quot;Stream On Demand&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of four, calling it &quot;Carpenter in his prime form&quot;, giving particular points to its world building and acting. Negative reviews such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Lawrence Van Gelder″s said it was &quot;ridiculous without being awful enough to be hilarious&quot;. Michael Dequina of &quot;The Movie Report&quot; was also unimpressed, giving the film 1.5 stars out of five, saying &quot;there&#x27;s no real plot&quot; further believing the film featured &quot;some of the most unlikable characters in recent memory&quot;. Paul Tatara of CNN gave the film a particularly hostile review, lambasting Carpenter as a filmmaker and finishing his review by saying &quot;as foul as it is, I&#x27;d argue that the main reason kids shouldn&#x27;t see &#x27;John Carpenter&#x27;s Vampires&#x27; is because it might stunt their emotional and creative development.&quot;

Other critics saw the film as mediocre at best. Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and noted that it &quot;has a certain mordant humor and charm&quot;, but was ultimately &quot;not scary, and the plot is just one gory showdown after another.&quot; Marc Savlov of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, stating he enjoyed the film&#x27;s cinematography, which he described as &quot;a comic book brought to life&quot;, but further noted that the film takes itself far too seriously and suggests the film may have worked better as a dark comedy. James Berardinelli gave the film two and a half stars out of four, stating &quot;Vampires is decent enough, but it&#x27;s unlikely anybody will remember this film in the following years, or perhaps even in following weeks.&quot;

In one of &quot;Vampires&quot;″s most positive reviews, Gene Siskel awarded the film with four out of four stars, calling the film &quot;a high-action homage to westerns and classic horror that actually has a unique story and masterful cinematography&quot; and &quot;a film that should put John Carpenter back on the map as a horror director and a film director in general.&quot; Siskel also expressed his fondness in the fact that film starred an all-adult cast without any teenagers and portrayed both vampires and vampire hunters in an original way. At the end of the year, he placed James Woods as his pick for his &quot;Best Actor&quot; suggestion to the Oscars.

John Steakley, the author of the original novel, liked the film but said it contained much of his dialogue and none of his plot.

===Accolades===

According to Carpenter, Gary Kibbe was shortlisted for the Best Cinematography at the 71st Academy Awards.

<doc id="975914" wikidata="Q2550591" url="?curid=975914" title="Say You Will (album)">
<text>Say You Will is the seventeenth and final studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 15 April 2003. It followed 1995&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; and was their first album since 1970 without vocalist/keyboardist Christine McVie as a full member following her departure in 1998, although she participated in some songs as a guest musician; it would be her last time being involved with the band in a studio capacity before her death in 2022. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks shared keyboard duties throughout the album.

This was the band&#x27;s last full album with Buckingham before his dismissal from the group in 2018, although he participated in their 2013 extended play.

&quot;Say You Will&quot; was the first studio Fleetwood Mac album to peak in the top three in the US since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Mirage&quot;. The album debuted at No. 3 with sales of 218,000, spent two months within the top 40, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in July 2003 for 500,000 copies shipped in the US. In the UK, the album peaked at No. 6 and was certified Gold by the BPI in May 2003 for 100,000 copies shipped.

A limited edition version of the album was issued at the same time, featuring two live tracks (&quot;Peacekeeper&quot; and &quot;Say You Will&quot;), two additional studio tracks (Nicks&#x27; &quot;Not Make Believe&quot; and Buckingham&#x27;s cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;), an expanded booklet and poster.

==Background==
Soon after the release of &quot;Time&quot;, Billy Burnette and Bekka Bramlett departed to form the country duo Bekka &amp; Billy. Rather than continue without them, Fleetwood Mac chose to disband. By 1997, the &quot;Rumours&quot; lineup agreed to perform again for an MTV Unplugged special. Following the successful reunion album, &quot;The Dance&quot;, which included a live performance of &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;, Christine McVie left the group, citing her fear of flying as the primary reason. &quot;Chris left in 1998 and we didn&#x27;t start &quot;Say You Will&quot; until 2002,&quot; recalled Stevie Nicks. &quot;It took us that long to figure out what the hell we were going to do without her – or even if we could do without her.&quot;

In the early 2000s, Buckingham was finishing up a solo album but was encouraged by the band to set the material aside for a Fleetwood Mac record. With the exception of &quot;What&#x27;s the World Coming To?&quot; and &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, all of Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Say You Will&quot; songs were considered for his aborted solo record. Some of Buckingham&#x27;s songs on &quot;Say You Will&quot; were initially developed in the mid 1990s with Mick Fleetwood and Rob Cavallo in Hollywood. Buckingham stated that the body of music he created during these solo sessions &quot;tapped into some new areas&quot; and were &quot;the best that I’ve ever done on my own, or with Fleetwood Mac&quot;.

To round out &quot;Say You Will&quot;, Nicks brought in new material, along with leftovers from previous albums. While Nicks was recording her &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; album in 2001, she left the band 17 songs to develop in her absence. The band picked five, including &quot;Smile At You&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;, which were written in 1975–76. &quot;Smile at You&quot; was also rehearsed for the &quot;Tusk&quot; album in 1979 and the &quot;Mirage&quot; album in 1982. Nicks identified two songs that were originally conceived as solo songs but were instead given to Fleetwood Mac. One of those songs, &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, was originally recorded for &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;, but it was left off that album and reworked for &quot;Say You Will&quot;. According to Buckingham, Nicks had previously tried three different mixes of &quot;Thrown Down&quot; with three different people, but none of them worked out. &quot;It was just obvious to me it needed a guitar riff in the chorus. It was a fairly simple thing, for some reason. There seems to be an understanding between us as to what to do.&quot;

By the time Nicks returned from her Trouble in Shangri-La tour, the band had made considerable progress on her material. Nicks was pleased with what she heard, but felt obligated to write four additional compositions at her Phoenix home in December 2001. Two of those songs – &quot;Silver Girl&quot; and the title track – feature Sheryl Crow. Nicks wrote &quot;Illume (9–11)&quot; after the September 11 attacks and described it as one of her only songs with political undertones. Nicks wrote two additional songs about 9/11, namely &quot;Get Back on the Plane,&quot; and &quot;The Towers Touched the Sky&quot;, but neither were included on the album. Her fourth new contribution was titled &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;.

Christine McVie was in contact with Fleetwood throughout portions of the recording sessions and expressed interest in writing for the band. &quot;She could have come on board in the early stages of the recording,&quot; Fleetwood observed, &quot;but, as time went on, that became more impractical.&quot; Nonetheless, the band retained McVie&#x27;s contributions recorded before her departure, including her vocals and organ playing on &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;.

With their surplus of material, the band considered making &quot;Say You Will&quot; a double album, but opted to condense it into a single disc of 18 songs. &quot;Not Make Believe&quot;, &quot;Gift of Screws, &quot;Down on Rodeo&quot;, &quot;Someone&#x27;s Gotta Change Your Mind&quot;, and a Rolling Stones cover of &quot;I Am Waiting&quot; were all rehearsed and considered for the track list. &quot;Not Make Believe&quot; was included on the limited edition of &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;, &quot;Down on Rodeo&quot;, and &quot;Someone&#x27;s Gotta Change Your Mind&quot; were selected for Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;Under the Skin&quot; album in 2006, and &quot;Gift of Screws&quot; appeared on Buckingham&#x27;s 2008 album of the same name.

==Critical reception and analysis==
 Many reviewers noted the absence of Christine McVie and the album&#x27;s length. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that McVie&#x27;s &quot;dusky voice and deft songwriting touch are missed, particularly on an 18-song disc without enough quality tunes to justify its length&quot;. They were more complimentary of Buckingham&#x27;s arrangements, compositions, and production. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;while the album&#x27;s highlights shine brightly, the absence of the group&#x27;s least heralded songwriter [Christine McVie] ultimately proves a significant obstacle&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic believed that the album sounded like &quot;Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks&#x27; albums bouncing around on shuffle play, but also [has] occasionally flashing moments that are purely, satisfyingly Fleetwood Mac.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; characterised the album as &quot;a conversation between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, rather than a true band effort.&quot; &quot;Come&quot; attracted interest from the same publication for its heaviness and lyrical content, which they described as &quot;a harsh, heavy rocker that borders on psychotic with its ferocious guitar solo&quot;. In his book &quot;Dark Mirror&quot;, Donald Brackett called &quot;Say You Will&quot; &quot;the best Fleetwood Mac record in years, even with Nicks&#x27;s shattered voice and monotone nasal renderings.&quot;

<doc id="975918" wikidata="Q3799201" url="?curid=975918" title="Instant Funk">
<text>Instant Funk were an American 1970s and 1980s disco band, best known for their disco classic, &quot;I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)&quot;.

==History==
Instant Funk came out of Trenton, New Jersey consisting of Raymond Earl, drummer Scotty Miller and guitarist Kim Miller. The group was then called The Music Machine and they were very successful as a back-up band for The Manhattans, Bunny Sigler and also the TNJs. Throughout their careers, Instant Funk would be the back-up band for many stars, including Lou Rawls, Loleatta Holloway, The O&#x27;Jays, MFSB, Curtis Mayfield and Evelyn Champagne King (they are the backing band on the hit single, &quot;Shame&quot;).

The group relocated to Philadelphia in 1976 to release its first album, &quot;Get Down With the Philly Jump&quot;, as they started to formulate their own sound. The group followed this album up with a release for former MFSB guitarist Norman Harris&#x27; new record label Gold Mind, with front man Bunny Sigler entitled &quot;Let Me Party With You&quot;.

The Gold Mind label folded, and Instant Funk&#x27;s new cut &quot;I Got My Mind Made Up&quot; was transferred to the Salsoul label, which pushed the record heavily to all of the disco clubs. The remix of this song by club DJ Larry Levan and engineer Bob Blank quickly became the talk of Manhattan. &quot;I Got My Mind Made Up&quot; hit #1 on both the R&amp;B and disco charts and #20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1979. The group&#x27;s eponymous first album on Salsoul was also a hit, reaching #1 R&amp;B and being certified gold disc status.

Scotty Miller (born Steven Scott Miller on August 22, 1951 in Trenton, New Jersey) died on April 11, 2017, at the age of 65.

<doc id="975919" wikidata="Q7859003" url="?curid=975919" title="Two Hearted River">
<text>The Two Hearted River is a river in the eastern Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located entirely within McMillan Township in Luce County.

The river runs approximately through forested wilderness, and drains into Lake Superior. It rises in several short branches in northeastern Luce County, about southeast of Grand Marais. The north and west branches meet approximately south-southeast of Muskallonge Lake State Park. The main branch flows generally northeast, approaching Lake Superior at a sharp angle. It enters the lake approximately east of Deer Park.

The Little Two Hearted River has its river mouth about to the east of Two Hearted River. The North Country Trail crosses near the mouth of the Two Hearted River along Lake Superior.

==History==
A Michigan Historic Marker commemorates the Two-Hearted Life-Saving Station built in 1876 at the river mouth. It was a simple two-story building with a small lookout tower manned by six to eight volunteer surfmen who conducted rescues of the &quot;Satellite&quot; (1879) and the &quot;Phineas S. Marsh&quot; (1896). The station, along with the rest of the United States Life-Saving Service, was integrated into the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915, decommissioned in the 1930s, and its structures were razed in 1944.

==Popular culture==
Bell&#x27;s Brewery, a craft brewery based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, makes a highly rated (the best beer in the United States according to Zymurgy Magazine, the publication of the American Homebrewers Association) India Pale Ale named Two Hearted Ale, with a graphic that features the river.

The river is a popular destination for recreational fishing. As such, it was the title of a famous short story, &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;, by U.S. author Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway used the name because of its appeal; however, the geography of the story indicates that Hemingway was really describing a different trout stream, the Fox River near Seney. The story, set after World War I, was first published in 1925 as part of the collection &quot;In Our Time&quot; and republished in 1972 as part of &quot;The Nick Adams Stories&quot;. Later the short stories Part I and II start out the 2000 collection &quot;Hemingway on Fishing&quot; edited by Nick Lyons.

<text>Sheryl Lee (born April 22, 1967) is an American film, stage, and television actress. After studying acting in college, Lee relocated to Seattle, Washington to work in theater, where she was cast by David Lynch as Laura Palmer and Maddy Ferguson on the 1990 television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and in the 1992 film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. After completing &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, she returned to theater, appearing in the title role of &quot;Salome&quot; on Broadway opposite Al Pacino.

Her film roles include Astrid Kirchherr in &quot;Backbeat&quot; (1994), as well as a lead role in the drama &quot;Mother Night&quot; (1996), the role of Katrina in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Vampires&quot; (1998) and the part of April in &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot; (2010). She has had recurring roles on such television series as &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (2005–06) and &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; (2007–2009), and later reprised her role of Laura Palmer in the Showtime revival of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in 2017.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Augsburg, Bavaria, West Germany to an artist mother and architect father; the first of three children. She grew up in Boulder, Colorado, United States, where she was a graduate of Fairview High School (class of 1985). After graduating, Lee moved to Pasadena, California where she studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and later attended the North Carolina School of the Arts, the National Theatre Conservatory in Denver, and the University of Colorado.

After several years of studying, Lee moved to Seattle, Washington where she acted in several stage plays and appeared in several commercials. She studied with theater director Mark Jenkins at the now-defunct Empty Space Theater in Seattle.

==Career==
===1986–1993: Career beginnings and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;===
Lee&#x27;s first television role was as the dead Laura Palmer in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. To save on money, creator David Lynch intended to cast a local girl from Seattle &quot;just to play a dead girl&quot;. That local girl ended up being Sheryl Lee. Lynch asked her to audition for him after seeing a publicity photo of her in Seattle from one of the plays she was starring in at the time. &quot;But no one — not Mark, me, anyone — had any idea that she could act, or that she was going to be so powerful just being dead.&quot; The image of Lee wrapped in plastic, as well as her homecoming queen photograph, became among the show&#x27;s most enduring and memorable images. When Lynch shot the home movie that James Hurley takes of Donna Hayward and Laura, he realized that Lee had something special. &quot;She did do another scene — the video with Donna on the picnic — and it was that scene that did it.&quot; As a result, Sheryl Lee became a semi-regular addition to the cast, appearing in flashbacks as Laura, and becoming a recurring character, Laura&#x27;s cousin Maddy Ferguson, later in the series (a role which was reportedly written because Lynch, impressed with her abilities, wanted to give her a fuller role on the show). She worked again with Lynch when she appeared as Glinda the Good Witch in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990).

She also starred in the prequel &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, which elaborated on events leading up to Laura Palmer&#x27;s death. While the film itself was a critical and financial failure at the time of its release, Lee was praised by the critics for her performance, which earned her Best Actress nominations at the Independent Spirit Awards and the Saturn Awards. For her work in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Lee has been described as a &quot;Scream queen&quot;, in particular for scenes in the otherworldly Black Lodge.

In 1992 Lee starred as Salome alongside Al Pacino in the Broadway production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; in the Circle in the Square Theatre under the direction of Robert Allan Ackerman. The play co-starred Suzanne Bertish, Esai Morales and Arnold Vosloo.

===1994–2004: &quot;Backbeat&quot; and Post-&quot;Peaks&quot; career===
In 1994 she was cast as Astrid Kirchherr in the film &quot;Backbeat&quot;, a bio-pic of the early career of The Beatles opposite Stephen Dorff. The following years, Lee played the part of Liza in Gary Walkow&#x27;s 1995 adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novella &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; opposite Henry Czerny, the role of Helga and Resi Noth in the 1996 romantic war film &quot;Mother Night&quot;, based on Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s 1961 novel of the same name, starred alongside Craig Sheffer in &quot;Bliss&quot; (1997) and played the role of Katrina in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Vampires&quot; opposite James Woods and Daniel Baldwin. She played also a leading role in the 1999 crime drama film &quot;Angel&#x27;s Dance&quot; with Kyle Chandler and Jim Belushi and starred as Dr. Sarah Church in the short lived series &quot;L.A. Doctors&quot; (1998—1999) which ran for a single season.

Lee starred opposite Anthony Michael Hall as the sweet but vengeful housewife Eve Robbins in the 2001 USA Cable movie &quot;Hitched&quot;.

In 2001 she presented the &quot;I Love 1990&quot; segment of the BBC&#x27;s popular &quot;I Love 1990s&quot; series.

There is speculation that she (and Phoebe Augustine, who played her friend Ronette in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) appeared in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001). Many online databases even list them as appearing uncredited in the movie, but it&#x27;s unknown if it&#x27;s actually them or actresses who look similar to Laura and Ronette, and it has never been confirmed either way.

She played the leading role of Elinore Murphy in &quot;Children on Their Birthdays&quot; (2002), based on the short story of the same title by Truman Capote. In the 2003 television series &quot;Kingpin&quot;, she played the role of Marlene Cadena opposite Yancey Arias and Bobby Cannavale.

In 2004 Lee was the original choice for the role of Mary-Alice Young on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. It would have been the second time she would have played a dead character on a series; however, the producers ultimately chose to replace her with Brenda Strong, as producers thought that Lee was not right for the part. Strong commented on the casting change for her character, explaining, &quot;I think it was a conceptual shift ... There certainly wasn&#x27;t something wrong with what [Lee] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate.&quot;

===2005–present: Return to television and independent films===

In 2005–06, she played the recurring role of Ellie Harp, the biological mother of Peyton Sawyer (played by Hilarie Burton), who battles breast cancer, on the third season of the WB Network series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;.
In 2007 and 2008 Lee appeared on the ABC dramedy &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; as Andrea Smithson, the mother of Brian Darling&#x27;s (Glenn Fitzgerald) illegitimate child. Lee, along with several other &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; cast members, guest starred in a special &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;-themed episode of &quot;Psych&quot; titled &quot;Dual Spires.&quot; Other cast members reunited with Lee included Sherilyn Fenn (Audrey Horne), Dana Ashbrook (Bobby Briggs), Ray Wise (Leland Palmer), Lenny Von Dohlen (Harold Smith), Robyn Lively (Lana Budding Milford), and Catherine E. Coulson (The Log Lady).

In 2010 she appeared in a supporting role as April in Debra Granik&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot; (which won best picture at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010). The film is about a seventeen-year-old girl (Jennifer Lawrence) in the rural Ozarks, caring for her mentally-ill mother and her younger brother and sister, when she discovers that her father put their house and land up as a bond for a court appearance, at which he failed to appear. Lee won two Awards for &quot;Best Ensemble&quot; at Detroit Film Critics Society and Gotham Awards, shared with the cast. Lee played Lucie Sliger in the 2011 crime thriller &quot;Texas Killing Fields&quot; alongside Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington and Chloë Grace Moretz.

In the art drama thriller &quot;White Bird in a Blizzard&quot; (2014), written and directed by Gregg Araki, she played May opposite Shailene Woodley and Eva Green. In 2015, at the Twin Peaks UK Festival, Lee confirmed that she would be returning to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; for the 2017 limited Showtime run.

In 2016 she appeared in a supporting role as Air in the Netflix production &quot;Rebirth&quot;, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, and had a small part as Karen in &quot;Café Society&quot;, written and directed by Woody Allen. The film had its premiere at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. In 2017 she reprised her role as Laura Palmer in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and also playing the part of Carrie Page, making it her third character in the series. Although she was credited in every one of the 18 episodes, most of her appearance was in archive footage. New material of her was seen in the episodes Part 2, Part 17 and Part 18. The same year, she starred as Alley in the short film &quot;Dead Ink Archive&quot; by David Schendel, making it their second collaboration after the 1994 film &quot;The Can&quot; (which was filmed in the late 1980s). In 2018 Lee played one of the leads in the Teen-Thriller &quot;#SquadGoals&quot; as Emily Hodges.

In 2019, Lee returned to Theater, playing alongside Judd Nelson in &quot;Love Letters&quot;. She performed the play before in 1991 with Luke Perry and Tim Daly as co-stars.

The 2020-released book &quot;Laura&#x27;s Ghost: Women Speak about Twin Peaks&quot; by Courtenay Stallings, which explores the legacy of the fictional character Laura Palmer, played by Lee in the television show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, features interviews and a foreword from Lee.

==Personal life==

Lee dated David Duchovny, who was one of her &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; cast-mates. She was at one time married to Jesse Diamond, a photographer and son of singer and songwriter Neil Diamond. They have a son, Elijah, born in 2000.

In 2014, Lee revealed that she had been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called neutropenia.

Lee is also a Teacher at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. Together with her former &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; castmate Gary Hershberger (who played &quot;Mike Nelson&quot;), Lee teaches actors, directors and writers at their workshop &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Director Workshop&quot;.

===Philanthropy and activism===
Lee is an animal rights and environmental activist. She appeared nude in two print advertisements for PETA.

In October 2008, Lee participated in the 3rd Munchkin&#x27;s Project Pink annual breast cancer awareness campaign to raise money for breast cancer research.

Additionally, Lee has also participated in various environmentalist events and charities: In November 2000, she attended the premiere of the public awareness campaign &quot;Why Are We Here?&quot;, to raise awareness for biodiversity protection, In 2011, Lee attended the iMatter March in Denver, Colorado to raise awareness about climate change, and also supported the &quot;Ride for Renewables&quot; project to promote renewable energy. In December 2011, Lee advocated the protection of wolves and supported the environmental organization WildEarth Guardians&#x27;s &quot;Wolves in the American West&quot; campaign.

In September 2012, Lee signed environmental activist Tom Weis&#x27;s open letter calling on President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney to withdraw their support for the construction of the southern leg of Keystone XL, a pipeline that would transport bitumen from Montana to Texas. Other signatories included climate scientist James Hansen and actors Daryl Hannah, Mariel Hemingway, and Ed Begley Jr.

On December 8, 2012, Lee performed poems written by herself as part of a collaborative performance along with artist Marina DeBris, dancer Maya Gabay, and musician Marla Leigh, for the U.S. National Committee for UN Women&#x27;s &quot;First Annual Special Assembly: Women, Climate Change, and Human Rights&quot;.

<text>The Fulbright Hearings refers to any of the set of U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Vietnam conducted between 1966 and 1971. This article concerns those held by the U.S. Senate in 1971 relating to the Vietnam War. By April 1971, with at least seven pending legislative proposals concerning the war, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Democratic Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas began to hear testimony. The 22 hearings, titled &quot;Legislative Proposals Relating to the War in Southeast Asia&quot;, were held on eleven different days between April 20, 1971, and May 27, 1971. The hearings included testimony and debate from several members of Congress, as well as from representatives of interested pro-war and anti-war organizations.

==Committee members==

*William B. Spong, Jr. (Democrat — Virginia)

==Proposals under consideration==
S. 376 — The Vietnam Disengagement Act, to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide that after May 1, 1971, authorized or appropriated funds may be used in connection with activities of American Armed Forces in and over Vietnam only: to accomplish orderly termination of military operations and the safe withdrawal of remaining American Armed Forces by December 31, 1971; to assure the release of prisoners of war (POWs) and the safety of South Vietnamese who might be physically endangered by American withdrawal; and to provide assistance to South Vietnam consistent with these objectives.

S. 974 — To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit any involvement of U.S. Armed Forces in an invasion of North Vietnam without prior and explicit congressional authorization.

S.J. Res. 82 — Proposing that the U.S. agree to complete withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel from South Vietnam within twelve months following completion of the exchange, under appropriate international supervision, of all POWs.

S. Con. Res. 17 — Reaffirming U.S. neutrality in the 1971 South Vietnamese elections, calling upon the President to implement a policy of strict neutrality, and creating a bi-partisan congressional commission, supported by a staff in Vietnam throughout the election campaign, to oversee U.S. policies and activities that might interfere with the electoral process.

S. Res. 62 — Resolving that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Armed Services should examine and report on the requirements and consequences of the orderly withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Southeast (SE) Asia including the safe return of American POWs.

S. Res. 66 — Urging the President immediately to withdraw all U.S. Armed Forces from Indochina and to terminate all military operations in Indochina except those of a purely defensive character related to the withdrawal, conditioned only upon agreement with the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Vietnam for the release and repatriation of U.S. POWs.

S.J. Res. 89 — Resolving that upon agreement between the U.S. and North Vietnamese Governments as to the release of American POWs, the U.S. shall declare a ceasefire in-place and withdrawal all its military forces and equipment from South Vietnam not later than nine months from the date of the agreement.

==The hearings==
Chairman Fulbright opened the hearings with a brief statement summarizing their purpose:

:&quot;Under our system Congress, and especially the Senate, shares responsibility with the President for making our Nation&#x27;s foreign policy. This war, however, started and continues as a Presidential war in which the Congress, since the fraudulent Gulf of Tonkin episode, has not played a significant role. [...] The purpose of these hearings is to develop the best advice and greater public understanding of the policy alternatives available and positive congressional action to end American participation in the war.&quot;

Fulbright commented that Congress&#x27; predicament had a precedent in the frustration experienced by the French National Assembly during the first Indochina war. That war ended only after the National Assembly responded to growing public concern and brought in a new government pledged to negotiate a settlement in Geneva within a month, resulting in the Geneva accords that ended that war.

===Testimony 8===
April 22, 1971. Testimony by John Kerry (Representative of Vietnam Veterans Against the War [VVAW]) on the necessity of immediate and unilateral withdrawal based on Vietnam veterans&#x27; personal experiences. Discussion then followed on means of disengagement from war and how to achieve political settlement in Indochina, as well as discourse on the viability of the American political system. Kerry was the only representative of Vietnam Veterans Against the War who testified on April 22, but others in VVAW were in the audience and at times supported his remarks with applause. Kerry gave a prepared open statement and was then questioned by the senators.

During this testimony Kerry asked his often-quoted question, &quot;How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?&quot;

During the 2004 United States presidential campaign, as Kerry was running for President, some critics focused media attention on his participation in the hearings and alleged that parts of his testimony portrayed American war veterans of that era in an unduly harsh light. Other critics went farther and claimed that Kerry&#x27;s testimony about US atrocities emboldened the North Vietnamese to torment the Americans POWs who were still imprisoned at the time.

====Opening statements====
Senator Fulbright&#x27;s opening statement was appreciative of Kerry&#x27;s views, and also mentioned a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, subsequently reversed, which ruled that Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the group for which Kerry was a leader and spokesman, did not have a constitutional right to use the National Mall.

====Kerry&#x27;s testimony====
After a brief supportive statement from Senator Javits, Kerry read his prepared opening statement, and stated:

:&quot;I would like to say for the record, and also for the men behind me who are also wearing the uniforms and their medals, that my sitting here is really symbolic. I am not here as John Kerry. I am here as one member of the group of veterans in this country, and were it possible for all of them to sit at this table they would be here and have the same kind of testimony.&quot;

&quot;The men behind me&quot; refers to members of VVAW and others who came to the committee to hear Kerry testify, which by all accounts was very crowded with supporters and media.

Kerry then explained the Winter Soldier Investigation, which took place earlier that year in Detroit, Michigan. This part of the testimony is considered controversial:

:&quot;...I would like to talk, representing all those veterans, and say that several months ago in Detroit, we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged and many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia, not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command.

:&quot;It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit, the emotions in the room, the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam, but they did. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do.

:&quot;They told the stories at times they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, tape wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the country side of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war, and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country.&quot;

After defining &quot;Winter Soldiers&quot; as a play on words from Thomas Paine, Kerry summarized the reason he and his supporting veterans were speaking out:

:&quot;We who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country; we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, and not redcoats but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out.&quot;

Kerry described the anger and betrayal felt by Vietnam War veterans, then moved on to political issues:

:&quot;In our opinion, and from our experience, there is nothing in South Vietnam, nothing which could happen that realistically threatens the United States of America. And to attempt to justify the loss of one American life in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to use the height of criminal hypocrisy, and it is that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart.&quot;

Kerry expressed his belief that nothing in Vietnam threatened the United States, and that the war was merely a Vietnamese civil war instead of part of a global struggle against Communism. He added:

:&quot;We found also that all too often American men were dying in those rice paddies for want of support from their allies. We saw firsthand how money from American taxes was used for a corrupt dictatorial regime. We saw that many people in this country had a one-sided idea of who was kept free by our flag, as blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties. We saw Vietnam ravaged equally by American bombs as well as by search and destroy missions, as well as by Vietcong terrorism, and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of the havoc on the Vietcong.&quot;

===Testimony 9===

Testimony given by Jay Craven, Susan Gregory, John Scagliotti, Chip Marshall and Kathy Sister (all representatives of Students and Youth for a People&#x27;s Peace) on the devastation of war in Indochina; genesis of People&#x27;s Peace Treaty; charged fallacy of President&#x27;s policy and failure of Congress and democratic system; necessity of new tactics to end the war.

===Testimony 10===

May 3, 1971. Testimony by Secretary of State John N. Irwin and Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs William H. Sullivan on the review of Administration policy on ending U.S. participation in Vietnam war and repatriation of American POWs; opposition of announcement to fixed date for total withdrawal. Discussion followed on the rationale for continuation of war, including Constitutional authority for President&#x27;s Vietnam policy; extent of Administration and State Department responsiveness to committee views and requests and to public opinion; U.S. activity in Laos and Cambodia during and after withdrawal of American forces in Vietnam. Also presented and inserted for the record, &quot;President Nixon&#x27;s Record on Vietnam, 1954-68,&quot; chronology of actions and statements as reported in the New York Times.

<text>Nocturne is a 1999 action-adventure survival horror video game set in the late 1920s and early 1930s – the Prohibition and Great Depression era. The player takes the part of The Stranger (voiced by Lynn Mathis), an operative of a fictional American Government secret organization known as &quot;Spookhouse&quot;, which was created by President Theodore Roosevelt to fight monsters. He investigates four strange cases and saves people from classic monsters such as werewolves, zombies, and vampires.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Nocturne&quot; is a survival horror video game. It features pre-rendered backgrounds superimposed with real-time 3D characters. The controls are fairly standard for the genre, but controls for moving and aiming are separate. In addition, a weapon must be drawn before it may be used. Therefore, if The Stranger encounters an enemy, he must draw his weapon, aim, evade, then fire with separate controls.

==Plot==
The Stranger returns from his unknown previous mission. His superior assigned him a new mission, along with a dhampir named Svetlana. The mission is to infiltrate a small village in Germany, to recover a relic that can grant every vampire who possess it immunity to their vampiric weakness. In the village, the mayor tells them that a vampire Count has the relic in a castle outside the village. During their journey to the castle, they witness strange occurrences, such as vampires attacking and killing each other rather than working together. After arriving, Svetlana suddenly becomes hostile and attacks The Stranger, before escaping inside the castle. After the count&#x27;s servant tips off The Stranger that the count has mind-controlled Svetlana in order to groom her, The Stranger enters the castle and kills the Count after battling his minions and brides, returning Svetlana to normal. The village mayor suddenly appears in front of them, revealing that he was the Count&#x27;s father. After the latter usurped him to become the Count, he, along with his loyal servants, flee to the village. They kill its previous inhabitants before pretending to be them. For ages, he battles the Count in order to retake the castle but to no avail. This explains the fighting between the vampires. He thanks the Stranger for killing his traitorous son, and promises not to abuse the relic. The Stranger and Svetlana leave with the Count&#x27;s bride to-be, who is not turned into vampire.

In the next mission, The Stranger is asked to investigate the small town where the dead come back to life and attack the townspeople. While on board a train, The Stranger is suddenly ambushed by a pack of werewolves who have a grudge against The Stranger for killing members of their pack in the past. After killing the werewolves, The Stranger jumps off the train before it explodes. After meeting with his contact and the town&#x27;s reverend, The Stranger battles the zombies and saves any survivors he finds. One of the survivors says that the zombies came from the abandoned mine in the town. Descending into the mine, The Stranger discovers that insectoid-like monsters are the source of the zombie outbreak. With the help from his contact, The Stranger manages to seal off the mine to prevent them coming up to the surface.

On the third mission, The Stranger is asked to destroy the factory run by Al Capone&#x27;s gang that secretly created an army of undead gangsters. After meeting with the informant, Icepick, (one of the reanimated mobsters that went rogue) The Stranger infiltrates a movie theater to get the proof of Capone&#x27;s factory. There, he is confronted by Smiley, the gang&#x27;s enforcer. With the help from Icepick, The Stranger manages to kill him. Entering the factory, he meets Smiley for the second time, and kills him again. After sabotaging the factory, The Stranger attempts to escape the factory. He finds Smiley blocking the exit. The Stranger kills Smiley for good by dropping him into a vat of acid.

In the final mission, The Stranger is asked to help Killian Hammond, Spookhouse&#x27;s former operative. In France, Killian requests The Stranger clean the graveyard of zombies and demons. While investigating the graveyard, The Stranger concludes that it is Killian who summons them. When he goes to his mansion to confront him, Killian subdues The Stranger and locks him in his dungeon. As The Stranger tries to make his way out of the dungeon, Killian taunts him and reveals the reason why he is doing this; he was forced to retire from Spookhouse, because of his hatred and disapproval towards supernatural creatures who join the ranks of the organization, ever since a vampire killed his wife. The Stranger also meets Moloch, a demonic member of Spookhouse who was declared missing. After freeing him and helping him recover his strength, The Stranger and Moloch escape the dungeon and confront Killian, who begs The Stranger to save him. The Stranger ignores his pleas and silently leaves the mansion as Moloch exacts his revenge on Killian. While debriefing The Stranger, the Colonel apologizes to him for his ordeal and what Killian became. He advises The Stranger not to let his distaste of monsters get the best of him if he doesn&#x27;t want to end up like Killian. To this, The Stranger agrees.

In Epilogue, The Stranger enters Spookhouse&#x27;s headquarters only to discovers that all of its staff are gruesomely mutilated. Shocked and confused, The Stranger enters the briefing room where he reads a message on the wall, written in blood that said, &quot;I finally found you, Stranger!&quot; as the screen fades to black.

==Development==
The game was developed by a team of 13 people.

==Reception==
The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;AllGame&quot; gave a very positive review of the game, giving it four-and-a-half stars out of five and stating that the graphics were &quot;perhaps the best graphics ever for a 1999 PC title&quot; and also praised gameplay, story and action. &quot;GameZone&quot; gave it 8.3 out of 10. Benjamin E. Sones of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; gave it four stars out of five, saying: &quot;If you have the hardware to run it, &quot;Nocturne&quot; is an intensely unique and visually beautiful game that will draw you in and keep you coming back for more in spite of its shortcomings. Just make sure you play it at night, and keep a few sharpened stakes close at hand...&quot; However, Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; gave it a negative review, calling the game as not terrible, but not terrifying either.

Camera angles were criticized. During gameplay, it is common to experience difficulty keeping track of the player/character, because the camera view can radically change when moving out of the current camera frame.

The game was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;″ 1999 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award. The staff wrote that the high system requirements provided impressive atmosphere for &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;-styled horror romp. It won the 1999 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; prize from &quot;GameSpy&quot;, whose staff called it &quot;the best adventure game [...] in a long time&quot;. It was also a runner-up for the &quot;Best Graphics, Technical Excellence&quot; award at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best &amp; Worst of 1999 Awards, which went to &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. The game was a runner-up for the &quot;Best Sound&quot; award at &quot;PC Accelerator&quot;″s 2nd Annual PCXL Awards, while &quot;The Stranger&quot; won the Best Actor award. It won the award for &quot;Coaster of the Year&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2000 Hall of Shame.

The game sold 109,000 units in the U.S. by October 2001.
==Sequel==
There is a partial sequel to &quot;Nocturne&quot; – a crossover between the &quot;Nocturne&quot; universe and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. The game, &quot;Blair Witch Volume I: Rustin Parr&quot;, is the first of a trilogy of Blair Witch games published by Gathering of Developers. The game stars the Spookhouse agent Elspeth &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday, who investigates the legend of the Blair Witch. The story&#x27;s background involves an old hermit named Rustin Parr, who killed seven children in Burkittsville, claiming that he was doing it for an &quot;old woman ghost&quot;. Spookhouse becomes interested in the case, and Doc is sent to investigate. The game was developed by Terminal Reality and uses the Nocturne Engine. Some other agents from Nocturne appear in the game. However, neither of the two following volumes in the series made any mention to the Spookhouse; although Elspeth and Volume III&#x27;s protagonist meet during a temporal breach in Volume I, the scene is not present in Volume III. Both &quot;Volume II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; also use the Nocturne Engine.

&quot;Nocturne&quot; was heavily influential in the creation of Terminal Reality&#x27;s &quot;BloodRayne&quot; game. The first &quot;BloodRayne&quot; game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Nocturne 2&quot;, and it contains several references to &quot;Nocturne&quot;, including several levels that take place in the German castle from &quot;Nocturne&quot;″s Act I. &quot;Nocturne 2&quot; was not greenlit by Gathering of Developers, who went defunct soon after, and the developers, unwilling to share the &quot;Nocturne&quot; license with a new publisher they did not trust yet, decided to create a new franchise which &quot;give[s] familiar nods to the &quot;Nocturne&quot; fans&quot;. The main protagonist of &quot;BloodRayne&quot;, the dhampir Rayne, is based upon the &quot;Nocturne&quot; character Svetlana Lupescu. Rayne&#x27;s costume in the beta version even suggests she was originally supposed to be Svetlana. The &quot;holy grail of the Vampires&quot;, the magical stone that can render a vampire invulnerable to most things that should normally harm him from &quot;Nocturne&quot;″s Act I, is the heart of Beliar in BloodRayne.

The name &quot;Nocturne&quot; for use in video games remained under trademark, forcing Atlus to license it when releasing &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne&quot; in North America, and for Ghostlight to change the subtitle to &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Call&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Icarus&quot; was one of nine s built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s.

==Description==
The I-class ships were improved versions of the preceding H-class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . &quot;Icarus&quot; only reached a speed of from during her sea trials. The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . Their crew numbered 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from bow to stern. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. &quot;Icarus&quot; was one of the four I-class destroyers fitted with minelaying equipment in late 1938 – January 1939 at Malta. This consisted of mounts for rails on the deck on which to carry the mines and an electric winch to move the mines down the rails. A pair of sponsons were added to the stern to allow the mines to clear the propellers when dropped into the sea. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; guns and both sets of torpedo tubes were modified to allow them to be removed to compensate for the weight of the mines. The ships could carry a maximum of 72 mines. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
===Service 1939-40===
On 29 November 1939, &quot;Icarus&quot; sighted the between the Shetland Islands and Bergen (Norway), but was unable to launch an effective attack because her ASDIC (sonar) was out of commission. Fellow destroyers and were called to the scene, and &quot;Icarus&quot; departed. &quot;Kingston&quot; was able to launch a successful depth charge attack, forcing the U-boat to surface and scuttle itself.

&quot;Icarus&quot; participated in the Norwegian campaign in 1940, first capturing the 8,514 ton German supply ship (brought to the United Kingdom and renamed &quot;Empire Endurance&quot;) on 11 April and then taking part in the Second Battle of Narvik on 13 April 1940.

She participated in Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk in late May and early June 1940.

===Bismarck breakout===
In early May 1941, the British Admiralty was on the alert that the &quot;Bismarck&quot; might attempt to break out into the North Atlantic; so &quot;Icarus&quot; was ordered to Scapa Flow for possible deployment against the Germans. On 22 May, just after midnight, &quot;Icarus&quot; sailed along with the destroyers , , , , and , escorting the battlecruiser and the battleship to cover the northern approaches. The intention was that the force would refuel in Hvalfjord, Iceland, and then sail again to watch the Denmark Strait.

On the evening of 23 May, the weather deteriorated. At 20:55 hrs., Admiral Lancelot Holland aboard &quot;Hood&quot; signalled the destroyers &quot;If you are unable to maintain this speed I will have to go on without you. You should follow at your best speed.&quot; At 02:15 on the morning of 24 May, the destroyers were ordered to spread out at intervals to search to the north. At about 05:35, the German forces were sighted by &quot;Hood&quot;, and shortly after, the Germans sighted the British ships. Firing commenced at 05:52. At 06:01, &quot;Hood&quot; suffered a direct hit from a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, possibly striking one of the aft magazines. The ship was wracked by a colossal explosion, sinking the ship within 2 minutes. &quot;Electra&quot; and the other destroyers were about away at the time.

Upon hearing that &quot;Hood&quot; had sunk, &quot;Electra&quot; raced to the area, arriving about two hours after &quot;Hood&quot; went down. They were expecting to find many survivors, and rigged scrambling nets and heaving lines, and placed life belts on the deck where they could be quickly thrown in. From the 94 officers and 1,321 ratings aboard &quot;Hood&quot;, just three survivors were found. &quot;Electra&quot; rescued them, and continued searching. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Icarus&quot; and &quot;Anthony&quot; joined in the search, and the three ships searched the area for more survivors. No more were found, only driftwood, debris, and a desk drawer filled with documents. After several hours searching, they left the area.

===Later service===
She participated in Operation Pedestal, escorting a convoy to Malta in August 1942.

&quot;Icarus&quot; was involved in many important events of the Second World War, Dunkirk, Spitzbergen, and numerous Atlantic and Russian convoys.

&quot;Icarus&quot; sank four German U-boats:
* On 14 October 1939 she participated in sinking of in the Western Approaches with destroyers , and .
* On 29 November 1939 was scuttled by its crew in the North Sea, after a depth charge attack from &quot;Icarus&quot;, and . All 43 hands on board survived.
* On 6 March 1944 she sank while in company with the corvette , the Canadian frigate , corvettes and and destroyers &quot;Chaudiere&quot; and in the North Atlantic.
* On 21 January 1945 she sank while in company with the corvette in the English Channel near the Isles of Scilly.

A long-time captain of &quot;Icarus&quot;, Colin Maud, was the Juno beach master at the D-day landings; in the film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, he was played by Kenneth More, complete with bulldog.

Lieutenant-Commander John Simon Kerans, famous for his part in sailing , down the Yangtze River, a feat made famous in the film &quot;Yangtse Incident&quot;, also served in &quot;Icarus&quot; as &quot;number one&quot;.

&quot;Icarus&quot; was paid off on 29 August 1946, handed over to the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation on 29 October 1946 and broken up at Troon in Scotland.

<text>Gregory Haines Laughlin (born January 21, 1942) is a politician from Texas. He is a former member of the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==
Laughlin was born in Bay City, Texas, and was raised in West Columbia, Texas, where he still maintains a residence, and he graduated from Texas A&amp;M University. Laughlin served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1970 and later was a reservist. Before the election to Congress in 1988, he practiced law in Texas. He served as assistant district attorney in Houston for four years before returning to private practice.

==Election and tenure==
A conservative Democrat, Laughlin ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1986, narrowly losing to freshman Republican Mac Sweeney, who had served as an aide in the Ronald W. Reagan White House. Laughlin sought a rematch in 1988, and this time he won. Laughlin survived a bitter re-election campaign during the next cycle despite old allegations involving favoritism to a firm.

Laughlin was the only member of Congress to see active duty during Operation Desert Storm, as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves in 1991.

In 1995, the Republican Party, which had gained a majority in the House for the first time in four decades, offered Laughlin a seat on the Ways and Means Committee if he joined the GOP. Laughlin did so on June 26, 1995. He claimed that, as a Democrat, he had to make some hard votes.

In the subsequent congressional election in 1996, Laughlin was endorsed by many Republican Party leaders, including then-Governor George W. Bush, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and other members of the party from outside the district and the state. Despite this, Laughlin faced a primary challenge from former Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party presidential candidate in 1988, and Jim Deats, Laughlin&#x27;s Republican opponent from 1994 (when Laughlin was still a Democrat). In the three-way race, Laughlin won the initial primary election with 42 percent of the vote, but by failing to win a majority he was required to face the second-place Paul in a run-off election. Paul defeated Laughlin by a 56–44 percent margin in the runoff election and went on to win the congressional seat. Paul, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012, held the seat until he retired in 2013.

==After Congress==
Laughlin remained in Washington, D.C., practicing law at the office of Patton Boggs, in the areas of public policy, energy, international trade, and tax law. He has since moved to the firm of Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, Pittman. Laughlin was contracted to work with the controversial Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, according to documents filed with the FARA Registration Unit of the Department of Justice. The firm&#x27;s software was implicated in the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The software was also deployed on world leaders, journalists, dissidents and human rights activists.

At the behest of Paul Biya, Laughlin formed a bipartisan group of former members of Congress to monitor the 2004 presidential elections in Cameroon. According to the BBC, he stated &quot;we have never seen such a transparent way to show who got the vote&quot;. This was in contrast to the observations of a delegation from the Commonwealth of Nations led by former Prime Minister of Canada Joe Clark and Episcopal Conference of Cameroon.

<text>The is a mid-size passenger car manufactured and marketed by Nissan Motors over three generations. Almost all Cefiro&#x27;s were marketed as four-door sedans, though a five-door wagon body style was briefly available (1997–2000). In most cases, the Cefiro used Nissan&#x27;s VQ six-cylinder engines, named Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines more than ten years running.

Nissan marketed the Cefiro in the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) as well as worldwide, the latter under numerous badge-engineered nameplates, including as the [[Nissan Maxima]] (North America, Australia), Samsung SM5 (Korea), Infiniti I30 and Infiniti I35 (North America) and Maxima QX (Europe, Russia). Models manufactured under license were marketed in Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur and Taiwan.

The first generation Cefiro (internally designated the A31, 1988-1994), used rear-wheel drive; offered four- and six-cylinder engines; and became popular in motorsport drifting. The second generation (A32, 1995-1998) and third generation (A33, 1995-2004) used exclusively a front-wheel drive and V6 engine drivetrain. After the A31, A32 and A33 generations, Nissan would also later use the &quot;Cefiro&quot; nameplate on examples of its first generation Teana (J31) sedan — exported to Asian and Latin American markets.

Nissan began using the &quot;Cefiro&quot; nameplate - derived from the name given in Greek mythology to the god of &quot;the wind from the west&quot; - in 1988; the nameplate was officially retired in 2012.


== First generation (A31, 1988-1994) ==
Most of the information in this section was translated from the Nissan Cefiro article on Japanese Wikipedia at :ja:日産・セフィーロ.


Nissan released the A31 series Cefiro sedan to Japan on September 1, 1988, sharing its transmission, chassis, engine and suspension with the R32 Skyline, F31 Leopard, and C33 Laurel — except the diesel engine, which was available only in the Laurel. The ATTESA E-TS AWD drivetrain was offered after the mid-model refresh and was borrowed from the Skyline, which the Laurel traditionally shared.

The Cefiro rivaled the Toyota Mark II, the luxurious Toyota Cresta and performance Toyota Chaser triplets, with Nissan offering the Cefiro as a comparable fourth alternative to the Laurel, Skyline, and Leopard models, selling each vehicle at a separate Nissan dealership (&quot;Nissan Store&quot; for the Laurel and the Leopard coupe, &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; for the Skyline, and &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; for the Cefiro). This marketing approach of offering four different versions of the exact vehicle was used earlier with the Nissan Bluebird/Auster/Stanza/Violet RWD sedans during the 1970s.

The model code &quot;A31&quot; was chosen as the number combination &quot;A30&quot; was previously used by the 1967–1971 Nissan Gloria soon after Nissan had merged with the Prince Motor Company. The Cefiro took the top-level position at &quot;Nissan Satio Store&quot; as its exterior dimensions were the same as the luxury sedans Nissan Cedric (exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot;) and the Nissan Gloria (exclusive to &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot;) locations on a shorter wheelbase, and replaced the Nissan Stanza.
Brand new, the Cefiro was slightly more expensive than the equivalent Nissan Skyline/Laurel and benefited from Project 901 offered for the first time projector beam headlights, automatic tinting rear vision cabin mirror, electrically adjustable seats, automatic headlights, and steering wheel mounted radio controls. HICAS-II four-wheel steering, &quot;Super Sonic Suspension&quot; or ATTESA E-TS suspension packages could be ordered separately but not combined.

The suspension was shared with the Skyline and Laurel, using MacPherson struts for the front wheels and a semi-trailing arm suspension for the rear. If the Cefiro was installed with the &quot;Super Sonic Suspension&quot; system, a sonar module mounted under the front bumper and scanned the road surface, adjusting the suspension accordingly via actuators mounted on all four coilover struts and the front suspension was installed with a multi-link setup. There was also a switch on the center console that allowed the driver to change between &quot;Auto,&quot; &quot;Soft,&quot; &quot;Medium,&quot; and &quot;Hard&quot; settings. The speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering could also be separately reduced for a sporting feeling, and the suspension setting would modify both the steering feel and the shift points on the automatic transmission. 

Its equipment and features helped justify the moderately high annual road tax bill to Japanese buyers. However, the exterior dimensions and engine displacement (on models equipped with 2.0L engines) remained within &quot;compact&quot; class size regulations, keeping demand high. The Cefiro was marketed towards affluent married couples without children during the years before the &quot;bubble economy&quot; began. The Cefiro could be customized and ordered from several combinations of engines, suspensions, transmissions, interior fabrics, interior colors, and exterior colors according to their preferences. Also available was a modification to the front passenger seat of Nissan called the &quot;Partner Comfort Seat,&quot; where the top portion of the front passenger seat was further articulated to tilt forward, supporting the passenger&#x27;s shoulders while allowing the seatback structure to recline. At the time of its introduction, there were 810 possible combinations. First-generation Series A31 Cefiros can identify the combined specifications ordered by looking at the specification sheet affixed to the inside of the center armrest console lid.

The Cefiro sold in Japan is only fitted with the single-cam and twin-cam &quot; RB20&quot; inline-six engines, along with a turbocharged selection RB20DET. The RB25DE was also available with a 5-speed automatic transmission as the &quot;25SE-M Selection.&quot;
Nissan took the unusual step of marketing a left-hand drive version of the Cefiro A31 in Latin America, Turkey, Gulf States and other Eurasian countries as the Nissan Laurel Altima – in most export markets this slot was replaced by the Nissan Maxima. Unlike the Japanese versions, export models are fitted with a carbureted single cam &quot; CA20S&quot; inline-four producing and RB24 engine which was a single-cam 2.4-liter &quot;RB&quot; inline-six producing . 

1990 Nissan facelifted the A31 with revised tail lights, center console, grill, and cabin fabrics. Also available from 1990 were &quot;SE&quot; models, featuring revised taillights, a silver grill, revised bumpers, a center console, and an updated interior.
== Second generation (A32, 1994-1998)==


Nissan debuted the A32 series Cefiro for the domestic Japanese market in August 1994. Generally, the A32 was only badged as the Cefiro for the JDM; exported A32s often carried the Maxima badge. The A32 was marketed as the &quot;Nissan Maxima QX&quot; in Europe. The 2- and 3-liter engines were offered in export markets, while the mid-range 2.5 was only available in the home market. The Cefiro received a light facelift in January 1997, including new multi-reflector head- and taillights. Sportier models received black backing in the headlamps, while more comfort-oriented versions were chromed. There were also minor changes to the interior and the trim around the door frames, while ABS and airbags became standard across the range in the home market.

The A32&#x27;s character changed with its new front-wheel drive configuration and Nissan&#x27;s VQ six-cylinder engines. Four-wheel drive was not available in this and the next generation. The JDM Cefiro was also offered as a wagon beginning in June 1997 as an alternative to the Toyota Mark II Qualis. The Cefiro Wagon (WA32) continued to be produced after the sedan&#x27;s discontinuation, only being eliminated in August 2000.

In Taiwan, the Cefiro A32 was manufactured by Yulon under the Nissan brand. Most Southeast Asian countries (for example, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand) adopted the Cefiro name. In South Korea, it was badge engineered and introduced as the Renault Samsung SM5.

In the Philippines, the Cefiro A32 replaced the A31 Cefiro in 1997. It is powered by Nissan&#x27;s 2.0-litre VQ20DE V6 engine paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission.

In 2000, Nissan introduced an all-new trim, &quot;Brougham VIP,&quot; borrowed from the Nissan Cedric and Gloria top-trim level packages. The &quot;Brougham VIP&quot; is powered by the same 2.0L V6 engine mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. It featured a redesigned grill, headlight &amp; taillight.

By 2002, a new &quot;Elite&quot; trim was added alongside the &quot;Brougham VIP&quot; trim. Nissan&#x27;s 2.0L V6 engine still powers both trims mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission respectively. The new &quot;Elite&quot; trim featured power-adjustable seats, faux wood trim, a full leather interior with tufted seats, and a re-designed 6-speaker audio system with 6 CD/VCD changers. The &quot;Brougham VIP&quot; trim received different wheel designs, a unique pagcor emblem, automatic climate control, and a power moon roof.

By 2004, Nissan introduced another new trim called &quot;300EX&quot;. The &quot;300EX&quot; is now powered by Nissan&#x27;s 3.0-litre VQ30DE V6 engine paired to a standard automatic transmission with sport mode. It featured different wheel designs, leather interior &amp; seats, keyless entry, rear armrests, rear aircon vents, factory fitted alarm, immobilizer, power rear windshield sun visor, among other features.

=== Infiniti I30 ===

Infiniti launched the Cefiro in North America as the Infiniti I30 for model year 1996, manufactured at Oppama, Japan (where the Maxima was built), commencing June 27, 1995. To reduce ambiguity in the nameplate, the rear &quot;I30&quot; emblem used two fonts: a cursive letter &quot;I&quot; combined with a serif font for the &quot;30&quot;, eliminating the possibility the emblem would be read as &quot;130&quot;.

As Infiniti&#x27;s top seller then, the I30 was the brand&#x27;s all-new mid-level model, replacing the Infiniti J30. The I30 was positioned between the top-level, all-new Infiniti Q45, and all-new entry-level Primera-based Infiniti G20. The Infiniti I30 was also marketed in South Korea and Indonesia. In January 1997, the Cefiro &quot;Brown Selection&quot; was added to the lineup in Japan, equipped with the I30&#x27;s chromed front grille and a brown interior.

The I30 shared the 3.0-liter &quot;VQ30DE&quot; V6 engine producing with the North American Maxima. Revisions to the I30 over the generation included revised tail lights and trunk garnish. The Touring model, I30t, gained five-spoke alloy wheels, more firm suspension tuning, and a spoiler and BBS wheels. A small number of first-generation I30s had five-speed manual transmissions, many with VLSD. An in-dash hands-free car phone was available as an option.

== Third generation (A33, 1998-2004) ==
Nissan released its A33 series in December 1998 initially as the JDM Cefiro, subsequently marketing badge engineered variants worldwide — prominently under its North American &quot;Infiniti&quot; brand as the I30 and I35.

For the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM), Nissan offered the A33 in 2.0 and 2.5 Excimo, 2.0 and 2.5 Excimo G, 2.0 and 2.5 S Touring, and 3.0 Brougham VIP trim levels. A five-speed manual transmission was offered for the 2.0 Excimo and 2.0 S Touring. The limited edition &quot;L Selection&quot; and modified Autech version were also offered in Japan. In January 2001 the Cefiro received a facelift, incorporating the larger bumpers used on export models and the Infiniti I30.

===Worldwide===
In Australia, Nissan marketed the A33 as the Maxima from 1999 through to 2003. Trim levels were S, ST, and Ti—all powered by the 3.0-liter engine. In Europe, Nissan continued to market the A33 as the Nissan Maxima QX with the 2.0 and 3.0 V6 engines, producing respectively. In most Southeast Asian countries, the A33 was manufactured until 2008 as the 3.0 Brougham VIP and Excimo 2.0 G under license by &quot;Edaran Tan Chong Motor Sdn Bhd&quot; in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In Taiwan, the A33 version was manufactured by Yulon and marketed as the Cefiro, the last Nissan Cefiro manufactured by Yulon. In Iran, Pars Khodro manufactured the A33 under license from 2002 to 2012, under the Maxima nameplate. In Indonesia, versions were marketed from 2000 to 2002 as the Infiniti I30 Standard and Touring. Later models from 2002 to 2003 was marketed as Nissan Cefiro 3.0 Brougham VIP.

===North America===

==== Infiniti I30 (A33, 1998-2001) ====

Infiniti based the MY 2000 I30 on the A33 Cefiro. Engine power increased to and the manual transmission was no longer offered in North America (it remained available in the Middle East). Compared to the similar Nissan Maxima, the I30 included a more powerful engine with a variable capacity muffler and an additional fenderwell air intake, different front and rear body styling, gauge cluster design, a foot-pedal parking brake (as compared to the Maxima&#x27;s center console mounted lever), center dashboard design, the availability of a rear sunshade, and standard drivers seat memory. The I30t (&quot;touring&quot;), equipped included High-Intensity Discharge (HID) xenon headlamps with darker colored headlamp surrounds, a viscous limited-slip differential, larger 17&quot; wheels, and the availability of a Sport Package which consisted of a rear decklid-mounted spoiler and side-sill body extensions. The rear spoiler was offered as a dealer accessory on the non-Touring I30.

====Infiniti I35 (A33, 2002-2004)====
Nissan updated the I30 for model year 2002 as the I35 (A33) for its Infiniti luxury division, launching the model with an estimated $40 million advertising campaign beginning in September 2001. Sales began on September 12, 2001 at 150 retailers across the United States, continuing its role as a badge engineered Cefiro positioned above another Cefiro variant, the North American Maxima (A33B).

The &quot;I35&quot; nameplate reflected the new engine, a 3.5 liter &quot;VQ35DE&quot; V6, producing and teamed with a four-speed automatic transmission. Other revisions from its predecessor included the painted (rather than chromed) door handles, horizontal front grill, high-intensity xenon headlights, standard fog lights, revised trunk lid, combination lamps, larger badging, and low-restriction exhaust with chrome finishers. With the I35, standard tires increased from 16&quot; to 17&quot;, and the turning radius increased from 35.4 to 40.0 feet.

The exterior and interior were designed at the Nissan Technical Center (NTC) in Atsugi, Japan. The I35 featured a coefficient of drag of .31 (.30 where equipped with a rear spoiler), an interior passenger volume of 120 cubic feet, and a 62/38 front/rear weight bias. Manufacture continued at Nissan&#x27;s Oppama Plant.

=====Mechanical=====
The modular VQ engine design featured continuous valve timing control, a variable induction system, a silent timing chain, an electronically controlled throttle, micro-finished crank journals and cam lobes, molybdenum-coated lightweight pistons, a resin intake collector, digital knock control, six individual coils (one per spark plug), a cross-flow coolant pattern, electronically controlled fluid mounts, and double platinum-tipped spark plugs.

The I35 featured MacPherson strut and coil spring front suspension, a multi-link beam rear suspension with a Scott Russell linkage, front and rear stabilizer bars, and speed-sensitive power rack-and-pinion steering. The Sport option included a system marketed as &quot;Vehicle Dynamic Control&quot; (VDC) which made engine changes and deployed a brake to inhibit sliding behavior. Specifications included 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, electronic brake force distribution, brake assist, 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission; and an electronic traction control system, and engine-speed-sensitive power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, now with a 40&#x27; turning radius.

=====Equipment=====
Interior features included leather-appointed seats (marketed as &quot;Sojourner&quot; premium leather, at least in one instance reportedly developed in Florence, Italy) with seatback embroidered Infiniti logo (2003-2004); simulated birdseye maple accents on the center console (expanded to include vertical ashtray and surround 2003-2004) and leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, eight-way power-adjustable driver seat with manual lumbar support; driver&#x27;s seat automatic entry/exit system that moves the seat fore/aft on entry/exit; 14.9 cubic feet trunk capacity; trunk-mounted first aid kit and emergency inside trunk-release; temporary spare tire; automatic temperature control system, driver&#x27;s two position seat memory with entry/exit assist system, analog clock, HVAC microfilter ventilation system with reusable, washable filter, titanium-color accented gated shifter with simulated birdseye maple gearshift knob, front seatback pockets, electro-luminescent instrument cluster with multi-function trip computer, universal transceiver with rolling code feature, cruise control with steering wheel-mounted controls, automatic anti-glare rear view mirror with compass; stainless steel sill plates and an optional navigation system with dash-mounted power flip-up monitor.

=====Advertising=====
The I35 was introduced with an ad campaign featuring print, radio, newspaper, direct mail, internet ads as well as a television commercial by TBWA\Chiat\Day titled &quot;Hummingbird.&quot; The ad depicted an I35 driving in the background along a country road with a hummingbird in the foreground. The car and hummingbird moved at full speed, the bird&#x27;s wings blurred. The action then slowed, the voice of actress Natasha Richardson advised the viewer &#x27;not to blink&#x27; — and the action returned to full-speed. The ad closed with the tagline, &quot;More Power, More Grace, More I... the new I35, from Infiniti.&quot; 
== Later use of the Cefiro nameplate (J31, 2003) ==


Nissan discontinued the Cefiro in 2003, later using the nameplate on the Nissan Teana (J31), exported to Hong Kong, Nepal, Bangladesh, Singapore, Brunei, Latin America and the Caribbean. Ghandhara Nissan in Karachi, Pakistan, was the last plant using the Cefiro name when it was replaced by the Nissan Teana J32 in late 2012.

<text>USS &quot;Ray&quot; (SSN-653), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the rays. 

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Ray&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport News, Virginia, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 4 January 1965. She was launched on 21 June 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas H. Kuchel, the wife of United States Senator Thomas H. Kuchel (1910–1994) of California, and commissioned on 12 April 1967.

==Service history==
With her home port at Norfolk, Virginia, &quot;Ray&quot; underwent shakedown training and weapons and sonar testing until 6 October 1967, when she deployed to conduct Atlantic Ocean submarine operations until 12 December 1967.

In 1968 &quot;Ray&quot; again deployed for submarine operations in the Atlantic, from 8 April to 10 June and again from 13 November to 20 December.

&quot;Ray&quot; January through May 1969 in attack submarine training and fleet exercises off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea. She departed Norfolk on 6 June 1969 on a special operation before proceeding to Holy Loch, Scotland, where she arrived on 26 June 1969. She departed Holy Loch on 31 July 1969 and returned to Norfolk on 12 August. For the remainder of 1969 and into 1970, &quot;Ray&quot; trained in the Atlantic with other units of the fleet.

&quot;Ray&quot; spent most of 1970 operating in the Atlantic out of Norfolk. Her operations were concentrated primarily upon training and testing. In December 1970, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for a 14-month period. After its completion, she departed Norfolk on 5 March 1972 and engaged in various tests and exercises—notably two North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises, &quot;Strong Express&quot; and &quot;Escort Deep&quot;—during the remainder of 1972. She returned to Norfolk on 12 December 1972.

&quot;Ray&quot; departed Norfolk in late February 1973 to conduct a Mediterranean Sea cruise which lasted until mid-summer, at which time she returned to Norfolk and normal Atlantic operations.

The &quot;Ray&quot; performed Atlantic operations until August 1975 when it was transferred to SubRon4 in Charleston SC, where it underwent an extensive 18-month overhaul and refueling. After the overhaul the &quot;Ray&quot; went to New London CT for refresher training and then for a month in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and St. Croix) for shakedown and sonar calibration.

In August 1977 the &quot;Ray&quot; was deployed to a Med cruise. On 20 September 1977 &quot;Ray&quot; struck a coral mountain while submerged in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Tunisia due to a combination of equipment failure and crew inexperience. Her nose was blown open by a hydraulic displacement of water, making two &quot;wings&quot; on the port side. The sonar equipment was destroyed and there were several cracks along the hull. There was no other damage to the submarine, but quite a few crew members sustained contusions and got banged around. The worst injuries were sustained by a crew member thrown the length of Auxiliary Machinery 2, who had a dislocated hip and needed 70 stitches. The boat limped to La Maddalena, Sardinia, to cut off the wings, remove loose equipment and shore up the hull. This was followed by a surface transit back to the states for repairs that required a year of work at Charleston Naval Shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.

From 1977 through 1988 &quot;Ray&quot; made numerous Mediterranean and North Atlantic deployments including an ICE-EX in 1986 where she surfaced at the North Pole along with sister ships USS &quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SSN-666) and USS &quot;Archerfish&quot; (SSN-678), the first time three attack submarines had ever surfaced at the pole together. In 1988 and again in 1991 she deployed north of the Arctic Circle, earning a Meritorious Unit Citation, Navy Expeditionary Medal and Arctic Service Ribbon each time.

&quot;Ray&quot; participated in a six-month Mediterranean cruise as a part of the aircraft carrier battle group from October 1989 to April 1990. She participated in various exercises and underwater operations which included operating in the Gulf of Sidra inside what Libya claimed was the &quot;Line of Death&quot; that formed the boundary of Libyan territorial waters, a territorial claim the United States did not recognize. She pulled into several liberty ports during this cruise, including La Maddalena in Italy, Cannes and Toulon in France, and Gibraltar. After her return to Charleston, she underwent routine repairs in drydock the Charleston Naval Shipyard.

At the time of &quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s deactivation in 1992, she had earned five Navy Unit Citations, six Meritorious Unit Citations, six Navy Expeditionary Medals and at least three Arctic Service ribbons, making &quot;Ray&quot; one of the most-decorated attack submarines in the Atlantic Fleet.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Ray&quot; was decommissioned on 16 March 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, began on 15 March 2002 and was completed on 30 July 2003.

<text>James Macandrew (1819(?) – 25 February 1887) was a New Zealand ship-owner and politician. He served as a Member of Parliament from 1853 to 1887 and as the last Superintendent of Otago Province.

==Early life==
Macandrew was born in Scotland, probably in Aberdeen, where he was baptised on 18 May 1819.

He became active in the Free Church of Scotland, and from there, in the proposed colonisation of Otago (which was being advocated by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland, later the Otago Association). In partnership with his brother-in-law William Reynolds, Macandrew bought a schooner, loaded it with cargo, and set sail for Otago with his family. He arrived in January 1851.

Still working in partnership with his brother-in-law, Macandrew immediately became a major figure in the business community of Dunedin. Reynolds, his brother-in-law, began to build up a shipping business, while Macandrew himself established a trading firm in the city. The partners later established a steamer service between Dunedin and Melbourne, Australia. The two soon became very wealthy.

==Political career==




Macandrew was one of six representatives for the Dunedin Country electorate in the first Otago Provincial Council (1853–1855). He represented the Central electorate in the second provincial council (1855–1859), and the Port Chalmers electorate in the fourth provincial council (1863–1867). Macandrew was Superintendent of Otago Province from 1860 to 1861, and again from 1867 until abolition in 1876. He was Speaker of Otago Province twice (1853–1854, and 1856–1859). From January to November 1854, he was on the council&#x27;s executive.

When it was formed, Macandrew was elected to the New Zealand Parliament, representing the Town of Dunedin electorate. In Parliament, he fought what he saw as a bias towards the northern provinces (Auckland and Wellington) at the expense of his own Otago. He also defended the practice of opening Parliament with prayers (describing them as a necessary &quot;acknowledgement of dependence on the Divine Being&quot;), and lobbied that all Parliamentary debates be published.

He remained in Parliament until his death on 24 February 1887, having served in nine separate terms for the electorates. He first served for Town of Dunedin 1853–1858 (he resigned on 2 November 1858). He successfully contested a 14 January 1859 by-election in the same electorate and served until the end of the parliamentary term in 1860. Next, he served in the Bruce electorate 1865–1866, followed by Clutha 1866–1870, Port Chalmers 1871–1875 and City of Dunedin 1875–1879. His last term was in Port Chalmers again from 1879 to 1887, when he died.

He was Minister of Works from 5 March 1878 to 8 October 1879. For his last six and a half years in Parliament, he held the title of Father of the House, as the longest continuously serving MP.

== Personal life ==
Macandrew and his wife had four daughters and four sons. One son, Dr Herbert Macandrew, became medical superintendent of the Seaview Asylum in Hokitika.

He died as a result of an accident in Dunedin.

==Commemoration==
The town of Macandrew Bay on the Otago Peninsula is named after James Macandrew, and Dunedin&#x27;s former main sporting venue, Carisbrook is named after his former home in the city.

Macandrew Road in Port Chalmers is named after him.

Macandrew is buried at Macandrew Bay Cemetery.

<text>Aracibo (born c. 1480s) was a Taíno &quot;Cacique&quot; in Puerto Rico who governed the area which is now named after him (now spelled Arecibo).

==Pre-Columbian era==

Aracibo governed a tribe whose village was located by the shore of the river &quot;Abacoa&quot; (now known as the &quot;Río Grande de Arecibo&quot;). Aracibo had been known to be a &quot;just&quot; and respected &quot;cacique&quot; and his tribe had led a peaceful existence before the arrival of the Spaniards. The rivers close to the village were full of fish and turtles and so it was only natural that the members of Aracibo&#x27;s tribe were fishermen. Their land produced many fruits, such as papayas; the tribe were cultivators of corn. Aracibo loved to collect various animals and birds. He, like the rest of the other &quot;Caciques&quot;, reported only to the &quot;Supreme Cacique&quot; Agüeybaná.

==Arrival of the Conquistadors==
The relationship between the Spaniards and the Taínos was peaceful at first, however, all that changed when the &quot;Conquistadores&quot; started to enslave the natives. In 1511, Agueybana&#x27;s brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), discovered that the Spaniards were not &quot;gods&quot; and this encouraged the &quot;Cacique&quot; to rebel against the invaders. The rebellion failed after Juan Ponce de León&#x27;s troops confronted and killed Agüeybaná II.

==Crónicas de Arecibo==
In the &quot;Crónicas de Arecibo&quot; written by Puerto Rican historian Cayetano Coll y Toste, Toste states that his research and investigations led him to uncover the following facts. In the year 1515, all of the area of Arecibo including the rivers of &quot;Rio Grande&quot; and &quot;Tanama&quot; were given as a gift to a Lope Conchillos (who resided in Spain) by the Spanish Crown. Conchillos sent a helper by the name of &quot;Pedro Moreno&quot; to the island to administer his lands; Moreno found Aracibo and his tribe of about 200 Taínos living in the land; he then enslaved them and Aracibo and his people died shortly after.

==Legacy==
The crown in the coat of arms of the City of Arecibo represents the glory of the &quot;Cacique&quot; Aracibo, who was the first known ruler of the region.

<doc id="975961" wikidata="Q7613233" url="?curid=975961" title="Steve Mahoney">
<text>Steven W. Mahoney, (born 18 July 1947) is a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1995, and a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2004. In the latter capacity, he served for eight months as a minor cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chrétien. Mahoney is a member of the Liberal Party.

==Background==
Mahoney was educated at Richview Collegiate in Etobicoke, Toronto. From 1978 to 1987, he served as a councillor on the Mississauga City Council and the Regional Council of Peel.

==Provincial politics==
Mahoney was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, defeating his closest opponent by over 14,000 votes in the newly created riding of Mississauga West. For the next three years, he served as a backbench Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) supporting the government of David Peterson.

The Liberals lost the 1990 provincial election, though Mahoney was re-elected without difficulty and became Chief Opposition Whip. He ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1992, although he had only a minimal support base within the party. Most political observers believed he was attempting to increase his public profile, to be assured of a cabinet position when the Liberals returned to power. He was generally regarded as being on the right-wing of the party during this campaign.

Mahoney placed fifth out of six candidates on the first ballot of the convention. He withdrew from the contest after the second ballot, and endorsed Lyn McLeod. (This support was pivotal to McLeod&#x27;s victory on the fifth ballot, as she defeated runner-up Murray Elston by only nine votes.)

==Federal politics==
The Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in the 1995 election and Mahoney was narrowly defeated in Mississauga West by PC candidate Rob Sampson. He switched to federal politics two years later, and was easily elected to the Canadian House of Commons for Mississauga West in the 1997 federal election, defeating his nearest opponent by over 21,000 votes. He scored an equally easy victory in the 2000 federal election.

Mahoney supported Paul Martin in the 1990 federal Liberal leadership convention, but subsequently opposed efforts by other Martin supporters to remove Jean Chrétien from the leadership position. During his time in parliament, he was considered a Chrétien loyalist. On 11 April 2003 Chrétien appointed Mahoney Secretary of State for selected Crown Corporations. His primary responsibility was the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and he was generally regarded as minister responsible for affordable housing. Mahoney was demoted to the backbenches again when Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada on 11 December 2003.

As a result of redistribution, Mahoney was forced to run against fellow Liberal Member of Parliament Carolyn Parrish for the Liberal nomination in Mississauga—Erindale in the 2004 federal election. Parrish was often criticized in the Canadian media for making statements that were interpreted as anti-American, while Mahoney frequently condemned anti-American rhetoric during his time in the Commons. On 27 February 2003, he ended one spoken-word intervention by yelling &quot;God Bless America&quot;.

Parrish defeated Mahoney for the nomination, 2,165 votes to 1,925. After losing the contest, Mahoney told reporters that Parrish was &quot;so low in the gutter that it&#x27;s a shame that she&#x27;s standing to represent the Liberal party&quot;.

==Later life==
In 2006, Mahoney was appointed Chair of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board of Ontario. He announced his retirement in March 2012, and Elizabeth Witmer was appointed as his successor.

On 17 March 2014, Mahoney announced his candidacy to replace the retiring long-serving Mayor of Mississauga, Hazel McCallion, in the 2014 municipal elections. He placed second in the election, losing to former MP and City Councillor Bonnie Crombie.

<doc id="975962" wikidata="Q1928830" url="?curid=975962" title="Michael Parker (politician)">
<text>Paul Michael Parker (born October 31, 1949) is an American businessman and politician from the U.S. state of Mississippi. From 1989 to 1999, he served five terms in Congress as a member of the Democratic Party and, later, the Republican Party.

In 1999, he was the Republican nominee for Governor of Mississippi. He was defeated in a tight election that was decided by the Mississippi House of Representatives. He later served as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Army, with authority over the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==Biography==
Parker was born in Laurel, Mississippi and he graduated from William Carey College with a BA in English in 1970. Before entering politics, Parker owned and operated a funeral home business, insurance companies, land and timber companies, and a sand, clay and gravel business. Parker was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1988 following a hard-fought primary with a wide field of contenders. The district included Jackson, Vicksburg, Natchez, McComb, and Brookhaven.

===Party switch===

As a Democratic congressman, Parker wore his party ties very loosely. His voting record was conservative even by Mississippi Democratic standards. During Parker&#x27;s successful 1992 general election campaign, he did not endorse Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Clinton. After his re-election in November 1994, Parker voted &#x27;Present&#x27; in the election for Speaker of the House in 1995 instead of voting for the House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt.

On November 10, 1995, Parker joined the Republican Party. Although his district was almost 40 percent African-American—one of the highest percentages for a Republican-held district—Parker was reelected with little difficulty in 1996. He did not run for re-election in 1998 in order to focus on his bid for Governor of Mississippi.

=== Campaign for governor ===
In the 1999 gubernatorial election Parker had almost 9,000 fewer votes than his Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Ronnie Musgrove. However, due to the presence of two minor candidates, Musgrove came up a few thousand votes short of a majority. Under the state constitution, a gubernatorial candidate must win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of state house districts. Each candidate carried 61 of the 122 state house districts. The election was thus decided by the state house, where the Democrats had a supermajority at the time. However, Parker refused to concede, and the House elected Musgrove 86-36 along partisan lines.

===Army Corps===
Parker was appointed by George W. Bush as Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works), with oversight of the Army Corps of Engineers, which has numerous projects in Parker&#x27;s home state of Mississippi. Parker was one of the first political casualties of the Bush administration&#x27;s heavily centralized management style when he spoke out to promote the Corps of Engineers priorities and was then asked to leave in the summer of 2002. In recent years Parker has been a Washington lobbyist, specializing in infrastructure issues.

===Post-politics===
In August 2020, Parker endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for President, along with 26 other former Republican members of Congress.

In 2023, Parker endorsed Democrat Brandon Presley for the 2023 Mississippi gubernatorial election. He appeared in a campaign commercial titled &quot;Republicans&quot; which featured various Republicans espousing their support for Presley.

<text>USS &quot;Pargo&quot; (SSN-650), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pargo, also known as the red snapper, a fish of the genus &quot;Lutjanus&quot; found in the West Indies.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Pargo&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 3 June 1964. She was launched on 17 September 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Jean Gordon Holloway (née Hagood), the wife of retired Admiral James L. Holloway, Jr. (1898–1984), and commissioned on 5 January 1968 with Commander Steven A. Whitein command.

==Service history==
===1960s===
Assigned to Submarine Development Group 2 with her home port at New London, Connecticut. &quot;Pargo&quot; was altered for acoustics at Groton then was involved in acoustic trials that resulted in alterations to all U.S. submarines. After acoustic trials the &quot;Pargo&quot; spent much of its time doing arctic research, surfacing at the north pole several times. &quot;Pargo&quot; participated in the search for the missing attack submarine from 27 May to 7 June 1968. She spent the rest of 1968 conducting various trials in the Caribbean Sea and off New London.

===1970s===
The &quot;Pargo&quot; made her 650th dive on 29 March 1978.

===1980s===
The &quot;Pargo&quot; entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (Bremerton, WA) in February 1985 for an 18-month overhaul.
30 months later the boat was back in service, having upgrades to all non-nuclear systems.

=== 1990s===
The &quot;Pargo&quot; conducted the first civilian oceanographic submarine cruise of the Arctic Ocean in 1993.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Pargo&quot; was decommissioned on 14 April 1995 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 October 1994 and was completed on 15 October 1996.

==Awards==
*Navy Unit Citation – 4 awards (1969, 1970, 1973, 1975)

<doc id="975966" wikidata="Q6138496" url="?curid=975966" title="USS Queenfish (SSN-651)">
<text>USS &quot;Queenfish&quot; (SSN-651), a attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the queenfish, a small food fish found off the Pacific coast of North America.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Queenfish&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 11 May 1964. She was launched on 25 February 1966, sponsored by Julia Butler Hansen, U.S. Representative from Washington″s 3rd Congressional District (1960–1974), and commissioned on 6 December 1966.

&quot;Queenfish&quot; was launched one day ahead of the lead ship of her class, the &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, despite being laid down 18 months later, and as a result of a multimillion-dollar bonus offered by the Navy to the Newport News shipyard. She was also commissioned in December 1966, three months ahead of &quot;Sturgeon&quot;.

==Service history==
&quot;Queenfish&quot; spent the early months of 1967 practicing under-ice operations in the Davis Strait. She was assigned Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as her home port and arrived there in late spring 1967 via Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal, and the Pacific Northwest.

In 1968, escorted by the Australian minehunter HMAS &quot;Curlew&quot;, USS &quot;Queenfish&quot; was the first nuclear-powered warship to visit Australia. &quot;Queenfish&quot; berthed at Station Pier, Melbourne, on 5 March 1968. The visit was a success, despite anti-nuclear protests. (These dates are incorrect. Queenfish did not go to Australia in 1968) The visit was in 1978. 

In mid-1970, &quot;Queenfish&quot; operated below the polar ice pack in the Arctic, mapping the Arctic Ocean″s seabed for potential military purposes in the event of a war between the Soviet Union and the United States. She also surfaced at the North Pole in August 1970 and spent 20 days exploring the Siberian Shelf across the Laptev, East Siberian, and Chukchi seas.

From 1970 to 1973 &quot;Queenfish&quot; completed two Pacific deployments, two Vietnam excursions, and six cold war missions. She then entered the Bremerton Navy Yard for overhaul. &quot;Queenfish&quot; revisited the North Pole in 1985 and 1988.

In the mid 1970s the Queenfish was sent to the Magnetic Silencing Facility inside of Naval Base Kitsap Bangor for deperming treatment in order to reduce its electromagnetic signature

In 1983 Hurricane Eva struck the Hawaiian Islands causing extensive damage to the infrastructure on Oahu. As per orders from COMSUBPAC all U.S. Navy submarines put to sea for the duration of the storm. 
Upon their return to Pearl Harbor the fleet was informed that the electrical power at Pearl had been disrupted by the hurricane. Normally, while in port, the nuclear reactors on Navy submarines are taken offline and electricity is supplied to the boats via &quot;shore power&quot; cables. But because of the devastation from the hurricane this was not possible. Instead, the decision was made by the U.S. Navy, in cooperation with officials from the State of Hawaii, to bring the Queenfish&#x27;s reactor online, along with the reactors on two other submarines and reverse the current flow through the shore power cables. As a result, the three Navy submarines provided power to the island of Oahu for approximately 36 hours until repairs could be made to the islands power generating facilities.
July 1985 &quot;Queenfish&quot; deployed on a mission with the USS Aspro to the North Pole.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Queenfish&quot; was deactivated on 21 September 1990, decommissioned on 8 November 1991 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 April 1992. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 May 1992 and was completed on 7 April 1993.

The escape trunk was removed and is currently utilized at the US Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School, Key West, Florida in their Submarine Escape and Buoyant Ascent Tower.

<text>USS &quot;Seahorse&quot; (SSN-669), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second submarine and third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seahorse.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Seahorse&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 9 March 1965 and her keel was laid down there on 13 August 1966. She was launched on 15 June 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Paul Ignatius, and commissioned on 19 September 1969. Seahorse was the forty-seventh nuclear-powered attack submarine commissioned into the US Navy, serving until decommissioned 17 August 1995. Her ship&#x27;s motto was &quot;Thoroughbred of the Fleet.&quot;

==Service history==
Following a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea and visits to Roosevelt Roads and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Frederiksted on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, &quot;Seahorse&quot; returned to her home port, Charleston, South Carolina, joining Submarine Division 42. Through November 1970, she operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean, engaging in local operations and conducting attack submarine and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training.

On 30 November 1970, &quot;Seahorse&quot; got underway from Charleston on her first major deployment, in which she operated in the Atlantic and visited Bremerhaven, West Germany, before returning to Charleston on 14 February 1971. For the next four months, &quot;Seahorse&quot; conducted attack submarine training, engaged in air group operations, and made final preparations for an extended Mediterranean Sea deployment. Departing Charleston on 21 June 1971, she arrived at Rota, Spain, on 2 July 1971. She continued to operate in the Mediterranean until 4 October 1971, and was awarded her first Meritorious Unit Commendation for this deployment. Upon return to home port, she operated from Charleston for the next three and one-half months.

On 24 January 1972, &quot;Seahorse&quot; ran aground and was stranded for two hours while putting out to sea from Charleston. After breaking free, she returned to port for inspection and minor repairs.

On 9 February 1972, &quot;Seahorse&quot; again departed Charleston for a North Atlantic Ocean deployment, visiting Faslane, Scotland, before returning to Charleston on 11 May 1972. During the months of June, July, and August 1972, she spent four weeks at sea in the Atlantic providing services for air groups and participating in destroyer operations. In September 1972, &quot;Seahorse&quot; departed for the North Atlantic to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Exercise &quot;Strong Express,&quot; followed by exercises with the United Kingdom and Canada in October 1972 and with the Royal Netherlands Navy in November 1972. She returned to Charleston on 5 November 1972.

Upon the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, &quot;Seahorse&quot; got underway on less than 24-hours notice on 25 October 1973, deploying to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea with US naval and air forces monitoring the conflict and ensuring freedom of passage.

From 16 August through 25 September 1975, &quot;Seahorse&quot; operated in company with USS Nimitz (CVN-68) and USS South Carolina (CGN-37) as part of Navy Nuclear Task Group 75. In early 1976, &quot;Seahorse&quot; again deployed to the North Atlantic for ninety consecutive days underway. On 3 November 1976, she entered the Mediterranean on a cruise which lasted until 11 May 1977.

Throughout 1978–79, &quot;Seahorse&quot; underwent nuclear refueling, overhaul, and systems update in the hands of the Charleston Naval Shipyard.

In 1980, &quot;Seahorse&quot; deployed to the North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, and Mediterranean Sea on a five-month cruise. In July 1981, she participated in a major Second Fleet exercise that ranged from the North Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; sailed for the Indian Ocean in October 1981, returning to Charleston in April 1982, after a 46,000-mile, 181-day deployment that circumnavigated the globe, and touched five of the modern Seven Seas, and all four oceans. The remainder of 1982, she deployed to the North Atlantic, conducting Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV) operations, and participated in the joint US-Canadian Maritime Combined Operational Training (MARCOT) 82 antisubmarine warfare exercise.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; began 1985 underway above the Arctic Circle, and spent August through October of that year deployed in the North Atlantic. In July, 1986, she again deployed to the Arctic, and surfaced through the ice at the North Pole.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; completed her second transit of the Panama Canal in early 1987, en route to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington for overhaul; she was in shipyard hands from February 1987 through March 1989. In May 1989 she completed her third transit of the Panama Canal, returning to her homeport of Charleston.

From March through June 1990 &quot;Seahorse&quot; again deployed to Arctic waters and the North Pole.

In 1991, &quot;Seahorse&quot; was awarded a second Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations that included under ice operations, another surfacing through the ice at the North Pole, and noteworthy operations in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. In 1993, at the midpoint of another Mediterranean deployment, Seahorse won her second Battle Efficiency &#x27;E.&#x27;

During 1994, &quot;Seahorse&quot; deployed as the submarine element of UNITAS XXXV-94, a five-month circumnavigation of South America around Cape Horn, interoperating with Central and South American naval forces and conducting goodwill port calls. She completed her fourth transit of the Panama Canal at the conclusion of UNITAS, and returned to Charleston in December 1994.

In early 1995, &quot;Seahorse&quot; departed Charleston, her home port for twenty five years, heading to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for deactivation. En route, she again transited the Panama Canal, and conducted Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle operations.

USS &quot;Seahorse&quot;, the &quot;Thoroughbred of the Fleet,&quot; was decommissioned on 17 August 1995. Over her twenty five years of service, &quot;Seahorse&quot; earned a Navy Unit Commendation, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, and two Battle Efficiency &quot;Es.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Silversides&quot; (SSN-679), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the silverside, a small fish marked with a silvery stripe along each side of its body.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Silversides&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 25 June 1968 and her keel was laid down on 13 October 1969. She was launched on 4 June 1971, sponsored by Mrs. John H. Chafee, wife of then-Secretary of the Navy John H. Chafee (1922–1999), and commissioned on 5 May 1972.

==Service history==

Following shakedown in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean, &quot;Silversides&quot; began operations in the Atlantic with her home port at Naval Station Charleston at Charleston, South Carolina.

&quot;Silversides&quot; went into drydock at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, in January 1977, at which time her home port was changed from Charleston to Naval Station Norfolk at Norfolk, Virginia.

On 11 October 1981, &quot;Silversides&quot; surfaced at the North Pole for the first time.

In the autumn of 1984, &quot;Silversides&quot; left Norfolk for a scheduled refueling overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, entering drydock there in late November 1984. The refueling overhaul was completed in August 1986, and later in 1986 she returned to Norfolk.

In the autumn of 1989, &quot;Silversides&quot; departed Norfolk and voyaged north into the Arctic, surfaced at the North Pole for the second time, proceeded out of the Arctic Ocean into the Pacific Ocean, participated in United States Pacific Fleet exercises, made port calls in Hawaii and California, and returned to Norfolk via the Panama Canal, becoming only the second submarine to circumnavigate North America.

In Jan 1994, &quot;Silversides&quot;″ home port was changed from Norfolk to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in anticipation of her decommissioning there.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Silversides&quot; was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 21 July 1994 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard began on 1 October 2000 and was completed on 1 October 2001.

<text>The Connaught Rangers (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;) was an Irish line infantry regiment of the British Army formed by the amalgamation of the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) (which formed the &quot;1st Battalion&quot;) and the 94th Regiment of Foot (which formed the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot;) in July 1881. Between the time of its formation and Irish independence, it was one of eight Irish regiments raised largely in Ireland. Its home depot was in Galway. It was disbanded following the establishment of the independent Irish Free State in 1922, along with the other five regiments that had their traditional recruiting grounds in the counties of the new state.

==History==

===Early history===
The regiment was formed by the amalgamation of the 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) (which formed the &quot;1st Battalion&quot;) and the 94th Regiment of Foot (which formed the &quot;2nd Battalion&quot;) in July 1881. The amalgamation of the two regiments into one with the title The Connaught Rangers, was part of the United Kingdom government&#x27;s reorganisation of the British Army under the Childers Reforms, a continuation of the Cardwell Reforms implemented in 1879.
It was one of eight Irish regiments raised largely in Ireland, with its home depot at Renmore Barracks in Galway. The regiment recruited mainly in the province of Connacht. Militarily, the whole of Ireland was administered as a separate command within the United Kingdom with Command Headquarters at Parkgate (Phoenix Park) in Dublin, directly under the War Office in London.

The 88th were based in Bengal, British India, when they were amalgamated into the new regiment. The 94th were based in South Africa at the time of amalgamation; as the 2nd Battalion, it returned to Ireland the following year and sent a small detachment on the Nile Expedition in 1884 as Camel Mounted Infantry. The 2nd Battalion deployed to the Sudan in 1896 for the Dongola Expeditionary Force under the command of Lord Kitchener as part of the reconquest of the Sudan before moving to India in 1897.

===Second Boer War===
The 1st Battalion deployed to South Africa as part of 5th (Irish) Brigade, commanded by Major-General Fitzroy Hart, and saw action at the Battle of Colenso in December 1899, part of the attempt to relieve the town of Ladysmith, besieged by Boer forces. The brigade suffered heavily during their participation in the battle, the Boers inflicting heavy casualties: the regiment had 24 men killed and 105 officers and men wounded. The Rangers fought at Spion Kop in January 1900 and the Tugela Heights in February 1900 during further attempts by General Sir Redvers Buller to relieve the besieged town of Ladysmith. In late February the siege of Ladysmith finally came to an end after it was relieved by British forces. The 1st Battalion returned to India in 1903.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had three Reserve but no Territorial battalions.

===First World War===


====Regular Army====
The 1st Battalion, which was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Hurdis Ravenshaw and had been stationed in Ferozepore, India, landed as part of the 7th (Ferozepore) Brigade in the 3rd (Lahore) Division at Marseille in September 1914 for service on the Western Front.

The 2nd Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 5th Brigade in the 2nd Division with the British Expeditionary Force in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. Its marching song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; became famous. By October, the battalion was involved in the fighting around Ypres. On one occasion Private Grogan rushed seven Germans who had occupied a section of trench. He killed all of them. It cost him a cut forehead and four teeth.

Following severe losses in the battles of 1914, the 2nd Battalion was disbanded, with survivors transferring into the 1st Battalion. In turn, the 1st Battalion was redeployed to the Middle East in 1916, where it fought primarily in modern-day Iraq as part of the British Tigris Corps.

The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was based in Galway upon the declaration of war and would remain in Ireland until November 1917 when it moved to England. The 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion had been based in Boyle in August and would remain there until November 1917 when it relocated to Scotland: it was absorbed into the 3rd Battalion in May 1918.

====New Armies====
The 5th (Service) Battalion, which was formed in Dublin in August 1914, landed at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli in August 1915 as part of the 29th Brigade in the 10th (Irish) Division but moved to Salonika in September 1915 for service on the Macedonian front and then transferred to Egypt for service in Palestine in September 1917 before landing at Marseilles in June 1918 for service on the Western Front.

The 6th (Service) Battalion, which was formed in County Cork in September 1914 though largely recruited in west Belfast, landed at Le Havre as part of the 47th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. In just over a week&#x27;s fighting in the Battle of the Somme in September 1916, the 6th Battalion lost 23 officers and 407 other ranks. On 21 March 1918, the same Battalion was &quot;practically annihilated&quot; during the German spring offensive breakthrough. In one week the battalion lost &quot;22 officers and 618 other ranks&quot;. As a result of these heavy losses, the survivors were transferred into the 2nd Battalion, the Leinster Regiment.

=== 1916 Easter Rising ===
In April 1916, during World War 1, in what became known as the Easter Rising, Irish Republican forces in Ireland launched an armed insurrection against the authority of the government of the United Kingdom, with the declared aim of establishing an Irish Republic wholly independent in its sovereign governance from the United Kingdom. In response, the Connaught Rangers and other British Army units were deployed to fight against the paramilitary forces of the &quot;Irish Volunteers&quot;. None of the Connaught Rangers were killed in action but one was wounded.

A 584-man strong column from the 3rd Battalion Connaught Rangers, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A J Digan DSO, marched on Enniscorthy to fight the rebels who had taken over the town, however on arrival decided not to attack the insurrectionists&#x27; positions within the town to avoid turning Enniscorthy into a battlefield. In the days after the insurrection began the Connaughts patrolled the countryside seeking contact with any of those war parties that cared to show themselves, in the process capturing hundreds of prisoners of war and seizing their weapons stocks. A 250 strong force of the Connaughts, under the command of Major H.M. Hutchinson, marched to Ferns on 4 May 1916, and then on to Gorey the next day. A party of 31 Connaught Rangers led by Lieutenant L.C. Badham searched houses in Kinsale on 4 May 1916, and the next day captured a large number of rebels and their weapons. The Connaught Rangers&#x27; Column searched houses in New Ross on 9 May 1916 and then at Waterford the next day. The Connaught Rangers Column reached Clonmel on 16 May 1916, searching further residences in the town and capturing another large number of rebels and their weapon-stocks.

Another Column of Connaught Rangers, 422 men strong, led by Major O.F. Lloyd, searched houses in Bandon from 6 to 11 May 1916, capturing further numbers of rebels and weapons. The Column proceeded on to Clonakilty on 11 May and searched the district there also, capturing more rebels and their equipment. This Column marched to Skibbereen on 16 May, and entering the town and fanning out through the surrounding area, succeeded in rounding up yet more rebels with their arms. A number of Connaught Rangers who were in Dublin at the time of the Easter Rising had volunteered for temporary secondment to other units of the British Army such as the Royal Irish Fusiliers and Royal Dublin Fusiliers specifically to take part in the capital city&#x27;s defence against the rising. Sergeant John Joseph Barror of the Connaught Rangers killed two rebels in the fighting in Dublin.

===Postwar===
Following demobilization the Connaught Rangers was reduced to its peacetime establishment of two regular battalions. With the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919 both were stationed outside Ireland (the 2nd Battalion in Dover and the 1st in India). This was part of a general policy aimed at minimizing the pressures of divided loyalties, by relocating serving Irish regiments during &quot;the troubles&quot;.

===Mutiny in India, 1920===

On 28 June 1920, four men from C Company of the 1st Battalion, based at Wellington Barracks, Jalandhar in the Punjab, protested against martial law in Ireland by refusing to obey orders. One of them, Joe Hawes, had been on leave in Clare in October 1919 and had seen a hurling match prevented from happening by British forces with bayonets drawn. Poor accommodation conditions in the Wellington Barracks may have provided an additional cause of the dispute.

The protestors were soon joined by other Rangers, including several English soldiers, such as John Miranda from Liverpool and Sergeant Woods. By the following morning, when a rebel muster took place, over 300 soldiers were involved in the mutiny.

On 30 June 1920, two mutineers from the Jalandhar barracks (Frank Geraghty and Patrick Kelly) travelled to Solon barracks where C Company were stationed and, despite arrest, helped spark a mutiny there, led by Private James Daly, whose brother William also took part in the protest.

Initially, the protests were peaceful with the men involved donning green, white and orange rosettes and singing Irish nationalist songs. At Solon, however, on the evening of 1 July a party of about thirty men led by James Daly, carrying bayonets, attempted to seize their company&#x27;s rifles, stored in the armoury. The troops guarding the magazine opened fire and two men were killed: Pte. Smythe who was with Daly&#x27;s party, and Pte. Peter Sears (who had not been involved in the attack on the magazine but was returning to his billet when hit by a stray bullet). Within days, both garrisons were occupied by other British troops. Daly and his followers surrendered and were arrested. Eighty-eight mutineers were court-martialed: seventy-seven were sentenced to imprisonment and ten were acquitted. James Daly was shot by a firing squad at Dagshai Prison on 2 November 1920. He was the last member of the British Armed Forces to be executed for mutiny. The bodies of Ptes. Sears and Smythe were buried at Solan, while Daly and Miranda (who later died in prison) were buried at a cemetery in Dagshai. Among those who received a sentence of life in prison was Martin Conlon (a half brother to the eight brothers from Sligo town who fought in the First World War, in which four were killed in action).

In 1923, following Irish Independence, the imprisoned mutineers were released and returned to Ireland. In 1936, the Free State&#x27;s Fianna Fáil government awarded pensions to those whose British Army pensions were forfeited by conviction for their part in the mutiny. The bodies of Ptes. Sears, Smythe, and Daly were repatriated from India to Ireland for reburial in 1970.

===Disbandment===
Due to substantial defence cuts and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was decided that the six former Southern Ireland regiments would be disbanded, including the Connaught Rangers. On 12 June, five regimental colours were laid up in a ceremony at St George&#x27;s Hall, Windsor Castle in the presence of HM King George V. The six regiments were then all disbanded on 31 July 1922. With the simultaneous outbreak of the Irish Civil War conflict some thousands of their ex-servicemen and officers contributed to expanding the Free State government&#x27;s newly formed National Army. They brought considerable combat experience with them contributing significantly to the success of the Free State’s cause, and by May 1923 comprised 50 per cent of its 53,000 soldiers and 20 per cent of its officers.

==Memorials==
In 1966 a stained glass memorial window to the Connaught Rangers was included in the new Galway Cathedral, which renders honour to a regiment so long associated with that part of Ireland.

There are various memorials to the regiment and its soldiers in St. Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Church in Galway.

==Uniforms and insignia==
From 1881 to 1914 the Connaught Rangers wore the standard scarlet and blue full dress of British infantry (see illustration above) with green facings. The green collars and cuffs were intended to be a national distinction for infantry regiments recruited in Ireland but the Connaught Rangers was the only one of these not to have a &quot;Royal&quot; title and accordingly the distinction of dark blue facings.

The regimental buttons had a harp and crown surrounded by a shamrock wreath. The harp and crown reappeared on cap and home service helmet badges, in silver on a green background.

== Nickname==
In the mid-19th century a tradition grew up that the 88th had been given the nickname &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Own&#x27; by Major General Thomas Picton during the Peninsular War, &quot;as a compliment to their dauntless bravery in presence of the enemy, and their uniform irregularity in camp and quarters&quot;, a tradition that was inherited by the Connaught Rangers when the 88th and 94th were joined to form the new regiment in 1881. However, there is no contemporary record of the 88th receiving this sobriquet, and subsequent regimental histories and memoirs make no reference either to the nickname or its origins.

<doc id="975970" wikidata="Q4700190" url="?curid=975970" title="Akaka Bill">
<text>The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009 S1011/HR2314 was a bill before the 111th Congress. It is commonly known as the Akaka Bill after Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, who proposed various forms of this bill after 2000.

The bill proposes to establish a process for US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians similar to an Indian tribe. However, the bill prohibits indigenous Native Hawaiians from gaming and other benefits available to federally recognized Indian tribes. The 2009 House version of the bill prohibited indigenous Native Hawaiians from pursuing their claims in the courts and arguably legitimizes past transfers of Hawaiian land that would not have been legitimate for Indian Tribes. The most updated Senate version however allows Native Hawaiians to pursue claims in court. On December 16, 2009, a Congressional House Committee passed an unamended version of the Akaka Bill. On the following day, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee approved the amendments in S. 1011, the Senate version of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act. As of January 10, 2009, H.R. 2314 was not completely consistent with S. 1011.

Akaka said on the floor of the U.S. Senate in December 2010 that &quot;misleading attacks&quot; and &quot;unprecedented obstruction&quot; led to the failure of legislation in the 111th Congress.

==Purpose==
The stated purpose of the Akaka Bill is &quot;to provide a process for the reorganization of the single Native Hawaiian governing entity and the reaffirmation of the special political and legal relationship between the United States and that Native Hawaiian governing entity for purposes of continuing a government-to-government relationship&quot;.

The government that the Akaka Bill intends to reorganize is identified as the Kingdom of Hawaii in the first paragraphs of Indian Affairs Committee Report 108–85.

==Proposed provisions==
The recognition proposed in the Akaka bill is somewhat similar to the recognition that federally recognized Tribes in the continental 49 states have. However, unlike those groups, the current version of the Akaka Bill prohibits Hawaiians from establishing casinos under current laws without banning the establishment of casinos under future negotiations (Section 9a), from participation in programs and services enjoyed by Indians (Section 9f), from being included on the Secretary of the Interior&#x27;s list of Tribes eligible for federal benefits because of their status as Indians (&quot;Public Law 103-454, 25 U.S.C. 479a, shall not apply.&quot;), and from pursuing claims against the United States for past wrongs in court. Also, unlike recognized Tribes in the continental 48 states and Alaska, the Akaka Bill does not require any of the same requirements for tribal recognition. The Bureau of Indian Affairs requires the satisfaction of 7 criteria before recognizing a tribe, none of which are present in the Akaka Bill. They are:

* 83.7a: The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. 
* 83.7b: A predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times to the present. 
* 83.7c: The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present. 
* 83.7d: A copy of the group&#x27;s present governing documents including its membership criteria. 
* 83.7e: The petitioner&#x27;s membership consists of individuals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity. 
* 83.7f: The membership of the petitioning group is composed primarily of persons who are not members of an acknowledged North American Indian tribe. 
* 83.7g: Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of congressional legislation that has expressly terminated or forbidden the federal relationship.

The current version of the bill provides for negotiations between the United States and the proposed new Hawaiian government. The bill provides for the new Hawaiian government to negotiate for land, rights, and resources, however, the bill does not indicate what the Federal government will be negotiating for, that is what it is Hawaiians have that the Federal government will expect in return at the negotiating table. Typically however, in Tribal/U.S. negotiations, Indians give up their legal and other grievances against the United States in exchange for a portion of disputed land, rights, and resources. (See United States Code Title 25 Chapter 19 for examples.)

Section 2 of findings is based primarily upon the Apology Resolution of 1993.

Section 3 defines &quot;Native Hawaiian&quot; as:

:(i) an individual who is 1 of the &quot;indigenous, native people&quot; of Hawaii and who is a direct lineal descendant of the &quot;aboriginal, indigenous, native people&quot; who—
::(I) resided in the islands that now comprise the State of Hawaii on or before January 1, 1893; and
::(II) occupied and exercised sovereignty in the Hawaiian archipelago, including the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii; &quot;or&quot;
:(ii) an individual who is 1 of the indigenous, native people of Hawaii and who was eligible in 1921 for the programs authorized by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) or a direct lineal descendant of that individual.

Section 5 establishes the &quot;United States Office for Native Hawaiian Relations&quot;. In a revision to a previous version of the Akaka Bill, S.147, the new S.310 no longer requires consultation with the Governor of the State of Hawaii explicitly, but only the &quot;State of Hawaii&quot;.

Section 6 establishes the &quot;Native Hawaiian Interagency Coordinating Group&quot; for coordination of various federal agencies and policies, with the specific exclusion of the Department of Defense.

Section 7 establishes a commission of 9 members to certify which adults meet the definition of “Native Hawaiian&quot; established in Section 3(10), and to prepare and maintain a roll of adult &quot;Native Hawaiians&quot; by that definition. Originally requiring specific ancestry to be a member of the commission in S.147, S.310 only requires &quot;(i) not less than 10 years of experience in the study and determination of Native Hawaiian genealogy; and (ii) an ability to read and translate into English documents written in the Hawaiian language.&quot; The bill cites the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which was multi-racial from its inception, but it does not provide any opportunity for non-Native Hawaiians as defined by the law to participate in the new governing entity.

Once a roll is established, those on the roll will establish a &quot;Native Hawaiian Interim Governing Council&quot;, who would establish a permanent form of government. The bill provides that governing documents may, but do not have to be approved by a majority of the people on the roll, and that the form of government chosen &quot;provide for the protection of the civil rights of the citizens of the Native Hawaiian governing entity and all persons affected by the exercise of governmental powers and authorities by the Native Hawaiian governing entity&quot;, but does not enumerate if equal protection on the basis of race is one of those civil rights.

Section 8 defers any settlement of issues such as the transfer of lands, the exercise of governmental authority, civil and criminal jurisdiction, and &quot;grievances regarding assertions of historical wrongs committed against Native Hawaiians by the United States or by the State of Hawaii&quot; to future negotiations between the newly organized Native Hawaiian Government and the United States and the State of Hawaii. Also provides:” Nothing in this Act is intended to create or allow to be maintained in any court any potential breach-of-trust actions, land claims, resource-protection or resource-management claims, or similar types of claims brought by or on behalf of Native Hawaiians or the Native Hawaiian governing entity for equitable, monetary, or Administrative Procedure Act-based relief against the United States or the State of Hawaii, whether or not such claims specifically assert an alleged breach of trust, call for an accounting, seek declaratory relief, or seek the recovery of or compensation for lands once held by Native Hawaiians. Also Provides: &quot;Nor shall any preexisting waiver of sovereign immunity (including, but not limited to, waivers set forth in chapter 7 of part I of title 5, United States Code, and sections 1505 and 2409a of title 28, United States Code) be applicable to any such claims. This complete retention or reclaiming of sovereign immunity also applies to every claim that might attempt to rely on this Act for support, without regard to the source of law under which any such claim might be asserted.&quot; And Also: &quot;It is the general effect of section 8(c)(2)(B) that any claims that may already have accrued and might be brought against the United States, including any claims of the types specifically referred to in section 8(c)(2)(A), along with both claims of a similar nature and claims arising out of the same nucleus of operative facts as could give rise to claims of the specific types referred to in section 8(c)(2)(A), be rendered nonjusticiable in suits brought by plaintiffs other than the Federal Government.&quot;

Section 9 Provides: &quot;Native Hawaiians may not conduct gaming activities&quot; and; &quot;the Secretary (of the Interior of the United States) shall not take land into trust on behalf of individuals or groups claiming to be Native Hawaiian, and; &quot;(c) Real Property Transfers – The Indian Trade and Intercourse Act (25 U.S.C. 177), does not, has never, and will not apply after enactment to lands or lands transfers present, past, or future, in the State of Hawaii. If despite the expression of this intent herein, a court were to construe the Trade and Intercourse Act to apply to lands or land transfers in Hawaii before the date of enactment of this Act, then any transfer of land or natural resources located within the State of Hawaii prior to the date of enactment of this Act, by or on behalf of the Native Hawaiian people, or individual Native Hawaiians, shall be deemed to have been made in accordance with the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act and any other provision of Federal law that specifically applies to transfers of land or natural resources from, by, or on behalf of an Indian tribe, Native Hawaiians, or Native Hawaiian entities.&quot; and; &quot;nothing in this Act provides an authorization for eligibility to participate in any Indian program.&quot;

==Support==
Although the bill has changed substantially since some of these groups announced their support, supporters of the bill have included:

# Former President Barack Obama
# Hawaii&#x27;s Democratic congressional delegation Senators Daniel Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye and Representative Mazie Hirono.
# Hawaii&#x27;s Democratic State Governor and former congressional Representative Neil Abercrombie.
# Hawaii&#x27;s State legislature, which has unanimously passed at least three resolutions supporting federal recognition for Native Hawaiians.
# The National Congress of American Indians, the oldest and largest national Native American organization.
# The Alaska Federation of Natives, the largest organization representing the Native people of Alaska.
# The National Indian Education Association.
# The American Bar Association.
# The Japanese American Citizens League.
# Those who seek legislation to provide federal recognition for Native Hawaiians to ensure that the native (especially at-risk) population continues to receive services in health care, housing, education, job training, employment, culture, and the arts.
#The United States Commission on Civil Rights. The Commission previously opposed federal recognition in 2006, but reversed its position in 2018.

Supporters of the bill seek to protect the programs assisting Native Hawaiians, such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Kamehameha Schools, as well as health-care and housing for the Hawaiian population. Senator Akaka said, as he introduced the 2007 version on the Congressional floor:

The legislation I introduce today seeks to build upon the foundation of reconciliation. It provides a structured process to bring together the people of Hawaii, along a path of healing to a Hawaii where its indigenous people are respected and culture is embraced. Through enactment of this legislation, we have the opportunity to demonstrate that our country does not just preach its ideas, but lives according to its founding principles. As it has for America&#x27;s other indigenous peoples, I believe the United States must fulfill its responsibility to Native Hawaiians.

In a 2005 editorial in the Washington Times, the Republican Attorney General of Hawaii Mark Bennett vigorously defended the Akaka Bill against claims that it would create a race-based government, by explaining that the bill simply respects the “special status of native peoples recognized consistently for decades by the U.S. Supreme Court.” He argued that “Hawaiians are not asking for &#x27;special&#x27; treatment — they’re simply asking to be treated the same way … other native indigenous Americans are treated in this country.”

In addition, supporters of the bill – including other Congressional delegates, Governor Lingle, Hawaii Attorney General Bennett, Native American groups, and Asian American groups – argue that rejecting the bill would be racially discriminatory. Supporters also argue that the State legislature, which has unanimously supported the bill, is bi-partisan, multiracial, and multicultural and, as Hawaii residents, closely understand the needs of the Native Hawaiian community. In support of the bill, Senator Inouye responded that failing to pass the bill would discriminate against the Native Hawaiians, for Congress had already provided federal recognition of the other indigenous and aboriginal peoples of America. He also argued that the Rice v. Cayetano case cited by opponents was irrelevant to the Akaka Bill, reminding Congress that current Chief Justice John Roberts himself had written the State brief and had argued that Native Hawaiians were aboriginal and indigenous people and could be recognized as such by Congress. Senator Akaka had also asserted in his introduction of the bill:

This measure does not result in race discrimination. But discrimination will occur if this measure is not passed. It is undisputed that Native Hawaiians are the aboriginal, indigenous people of Hawaii. Yet some of my colleagues want to discriminate against them and treat them differently from other Native Americans – the American Indian and the Alaska Native.

In response to opponents citing Congressional requirements for Native Americans and arguing that Native Hawaiians do not meet such requirements, Governor Lingle and Hawaii Attorney General Bennett responded that the bill did not authorize Native Hawaiian participation in American Indian programs, that Native Americans and Alaska Natives support the bill, that to suggest otherwise resulted in placing native groups against each other, that barring Native Hawaiians from programs that provided to other natives was offensive. In addition, they also wrote:
The arguments against recognition for Native Hawaiians because Hawaiians cannot satisfy the requirements Congress set out for the recognition of Native Americans (in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934) are simply not relevant because Congress has not and need not include those conditions in S. 147. Native Hawaiians have always had to rely on a separate bill for recognition because the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 was never intended to be the means of providing recognition for Native Hawaiians – it literally only applies to the native people of the &quot;continental United States.&quot; See 25 U.S.C. § 473; 25 C.F.R. § 83.3...

Rather than crack the &quot;melting pot&quot; that is Hawaii (an outcome opponents of S. 147 purport to fear), passage of S. 147 will finally give official and long overdue recognition to the losses Hawaiians have suffered – the blurring, if not diminution, of Hawaiians’ native identity; the erosion of their confidence as a people; the destruction of any semblance of self-determination and self-governance; and, as the United States Supreme Court put it, the loss of a &quot;culture and way of life.&quot; Finally, Native Hawaiians will have restored to them what they lost more than a hundred years ago – status as a people and recognition of their roots.
In a 2005 interview, Senator Akaka said that the bill, &quot;creates a government-to-government relationship with the United States” as it provides a legal parity similar to that of native tribal governments in the contiguous states and Alaska. When the reporter commented that the bill could potentially lead to independence, Senator Akaka replied &quot;that could be&quot; but that it would be up to future generations to decide. Some who oppose the bill cite this statement as indicative of its potential support of secession of a Native Hawaiian government from the United States. However, the 2007 version of the bill has specified that secession is not a provision of the bill.

In 2018, the United States Commission on Civil Rights released a report evaluating the federal government&#x27;s efforts to meet its trust obligations to Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. Regarding Native Hawaiian sovereignty, it found:The federal government does not have an official government-to-government relationship with the Native Hawaiian community. However, Congress has acknowledged the role of the United States in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the annexation of Hawaii without the consent or compensation of Native Hawaiians. Congress has passed over 150 laws that promote the welfare of Native Hawaiians and establish a special political and legal relationship with the Native Hawaiian community similar to the trust relationship between the United States and Native Americans. In 2016, the federal government finalized an administrative rule that allows a unified Native Hawaiian government (if established) to enter into a formal government-to-government relationship with the U.S. government.In reversing its earlier 2006 position, the Commission recommended:Congress can acknowledge a government-to-government relationship with Native Hawaiians to confirm its intent to provide Native Hawaiians at least all the same federal benefits that Native Americans have. Congress should pass legislation to provide a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity and to confirm the special political and legal relationship between the United States and such Native Hawaiian governing entity.

==Opposition==
Opposition to the Akaka Bill includes:
# Those who believe that the bill is unconstitutionally race-based;
# Those who believe the &quot;tribe&quot; created via the Akaka Bill would shield corrupt trustees from prosecution;
# Those who believe that a school voucher system would allow Kamehameha Schools to serve all interested Hawaiian students and also admit non-Hawaiians thus eliminating the race-discrimination basis of the lawsuits;
# Those who believe that it could begin the process of secession of a single racial group from the United States;
# Those who believe the United States never legally annexed the Hawaiian Kingdom and that it has no jurisdiction over the territory and populace of the country;
# Those who believe that it could thwart the process of secession of Hawaii from the United States and the restoration of an independent Hawaiian nation controlled by native Hawaiians (native Hawaiian sovereignty activists);
# Hawaii&#x27;s Attorney General Mark Bennett.
# The George W. Bush Administration, which issued a letter arguing against the earlier version of the bill;
# Aloha 4 All, a Hawaii-based civil rights group;
# The Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, a Hawaii-based think-tank
# US Representatives who wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House and Majority Leader asking them to kill the Akaka Bill. The letter entailed three reasons for killing the bill: (1) The Constitution does not allow for a separate, sovereign, race-based government; (2) Practical issues have not been addressed such as how businesses could fairly compete with each other if one must for example pay state taxes and another must not; (3) Historical commitments do not support such a bill. For example, when Hawaii became a state there was broad congressional consensus and assurances given by the State of Hawaii that Native Hawaiians would not seek to be treated as a separate racial group and transformed into an &quot;Indian tribe&quot;.

Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists who oppose the bill believe that it blocks their attempts to establish their independence from the federal government and disregards 1993 Public Law (103-150), in which Congress apologized &quot;for the overthrow and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination.&quot; Washington-based constitutional scholar Bruce Fein has outlined a number of counter-arguments disputing the accuracy of the assertions made in the Apology Resolution, stating &quot;The apology wrongly insinuates that the overthrown 1893 government was for Native Hawaiians alone&quot;.

In 2006, the United States Commission on Civil Rights held hearings on the Akaka bill, and published a report that recommended against it. The report did not contain any official findings and its only recommendation stated in part:The Commission recommends against passage of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 (S. 147) as reported out of committee on May 16, 2005, or any other legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.The Commission later reversed its position in 2018.

Some opponents believe that programs maintained exclusively for Native Hawaiians, such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Kamehameha Schools, are race-based and discriminatory and see the Akaka bill as an attempt to subvert the February 23, 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Rice v. Cayetano&quot;, which ruled that limiting participation in OHA elections to Native Hawaiians was an unconstitutional restriction on the basis of race.

A Grassroot Institute poll found the majority of Hawaii residents responding to the poll opposed the Akaka Bill.

Some opponents are also skeptical of the bill&#x27;s language disallowing casinos or other gaming in Hawaii, since although it denies the newly created government &quot;inherent&quot; authority to conduct gaming, it leaves that issue open to future negotiation.

In May 2006, Senator Akaka began a run of fifteen daily speeches on the issue to gain support for a cloture vote on the bill, after the Commission on Civil Rights report recommended against the bill. Opponents of the Akaka bill have responded to his daily speeches, as well as to the arguments in favor made by other politicians.

Regarding the latest version of the bill, S.310, Akaka&#x27;s website states, &quot;This language has been publicly available since September 2005 and has been widely distributed.&quot; However, opponents note, S.147, which failed to get enough votes for cloture on June 8, 2006, did not include the revisions now present in S.310.

In 2007, at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Gregory Katsas stated:

By dividing government power along racial and ancestral lines, S. 310 (the bill) would represent a significant step backwards in American history and would create far greater problems than those it might purport to solve

<text>Jubilee is a musical comedy with a book by Moss Hart and music and lyrics by Cole Porter. It premiered on Broadway in 1935 to rapturous reviews. Inspired by the recent Silver Jubilee of George V of Great Britain, the story is of the royal family of a fictional European country. Several of its songs, especially &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; and &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot;, became independently popular and have become part of the American Songbook.

The musical opened on Broadway in October 1935, in the midst of the Great Depression. It had strong reviews and was considered &quot;one of the great theatrical events of the 1930s.&quot; It ran for 169 performances. Although the original arrangements were lost after 1948, beginning in 1986 the musical was reconstructed. It has been produced by several companies in New York, London and elsewhere.

==History==
Cole Porter and Moss Hart took a four-and-a-half month &quot;around the world&quot; luxury cruise on the &quot;Franconia&quot;, with their families, friends, and assistants accompanying them. Their intention was to write a new musical on the trip, and songs and scenes were inspired by their ports of call. For example, the song &quot;The Kling-Kling Bird on the Divi-Divi Tree&quot; came about after a trip through a botanical garden in Jamaica. Playing off the recent celebrations in Britain for the Silver Jubilee of George V, they created a plot about a royal family, filled with characters based on their famous friends. For example, the swimmer who becomes an actor is a spoof of Johnny Weissmuller, playwright Noël Coward is portrayed as Eric Dare, and the party hostess Elsa Maxwell is portrayed as Eva Standing.

==Synopsis==
Time: 1935

Place: In and Around London, England and Rockwell-On-Sea

===Act I===
When the curtain rises a ball is being hosted at the Royal Palace by the Royal Family (&quot;Our Crown&quot;). The King (Henry) and the Queen (Katherine) are sitting in the throne room, ignoring the guests, as the Prime Minister attempts to convince them to come to the Ball. The Queen is reading a movie magazine and suggests that the picture &quot;Mowgli and the White Goddess&quot;, which features swimmer Charles Rausmiller as the scantily-clad Mowgli, be shown at the Jubilee. The King then suggests that he could perform his string trick and Prince James and the Princess (Diana) come in with their own requests. Prince James would like to have American Dancer Karen O&#x27;Kane come to the Jubilee, and the Princess would like songwriter/actor/playwright Eric Dare to receive Jubilee honors. The Prime Minister denies their requests and the Royal Family is finally summoned to the ball after the guests begin to steal ashtrays, and the tassels off the curtain. Meanwhile, the young Prince Peter and his cousin Prince Rudolph scheme to be able to visit Radio City Music Hall so while the Cabinet is meeting, they throw a rock through the window, with a message attached to it. It reads: &quot;If the Royal Family is not out of the Palace by midnight, we will come and take them out. This is our first and last warning&quot;. The Prime Minister alerts the Royal Family that they will be evacuated to the dreary Feathermore Castle, but they decide &quot;to Hell with Feathermore!&quot; and that they will do something they&#x27;ve always wanted to do (&quot;We&#x27;re off to Feathermore&quot;). The Princess decides to visit Eric Dare (&quot;Why Shouldn&#x27;t I?&quot;) who is currently being greeted by a crowd of admirers (&quot;Entrance of Eric&quot;) after returning from exotic travels (&quot;The Kling-Kling Bird on the Top of the Divi-Divi Tree&quot;). The Princess requests an autograph from Eric, who becomes intrigued with Diana after she proves herself more thoughtful than the rest of his crowd of admirers (&quot;When Love Comes Your Way&quot;). Meanwhile, in a Municipal Park (&quot;What a Nice Municipal Park&quot;), the King is practicing his string trick, which is seen by socialite and party planner Eva Standing, who drags him off to be an attraction at her next party. The Queen, with the help of a man dressed as an ape, finds the theater where &quot;Mowgli and the White Goddess&quot; is playing (&quot;When Me Mowgli Love&quot;) and meets Charles Rausmiller at the stage door, asking him to help her with her breaststroke, to which he agrees (&quot;Gather Ye Autographs While Ye May&quot;). At the Cafe Martinque, (&quot;My Loulou&quot;), Prince James is watching Karen O&#x27;Kane perform (&quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;). He meets her and together they win a cash prize for the best-danced Beguine. Meanwhile, the King has been staying at Eva&#x27;s place preparing his party trick, while Eva attends to her schedule of social appearances (&quot;Good Morning Miss Standing/My Most Intimate Friend&quot;). The prime minister has been searching with all the means at his disposal for the Royal Family, but has had no luck. He just misses the King and Queen at the pool where Mowgli and the Queen have been doing their swimming lessons. The King believes that they are now running a risk of being caught, as he was photographed outside a news office. Meanwhile, Karen and Prince James have been comfortably living with each other for the past few days (&quot;A Picture of Me Without You&quot;). At a grand, Greek-themed party thrown by Eva (Ev&#x27;rybod-ee Who&#x27;s Anybod-ee&quot;), the Royal Family meet again. Two classical dances are performed, one of them featuring Karen (&quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot; and &quot;Aphrodite&#x27;s Dance&quot;). News breaks out that the Royal Family is missing, and to calm the crowd Eva says that the Royal Family is in this very room and there is no need to worry (&quot;Swing that Swing&quot;). The Prime Minister demands the Royal Family step forward; they do, and they are dragged off to Feathermore, &quot;that very nasty castle in the North&quot; (&quot;Finale Act One&quot;).

===Act II===
It is a rainy Sunday morning at Feathermore (&quot;Sunday Morning Breakfast Time&quot;). The Royal Family has invited all of their friends from the past week to the Castle, as they couldn&#x27;t stand the dull routine practiced at Feathermore. When their friends arrive, they decide to abdicate the throne and run off to Rockwell-on-Sea before going to America (&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;). At Rockwell-on-Sea (&quot;Six Little Wives&quot;), both the Queen and the Princess win &quot;Miss Rockwell 1935.&quot; The Prime Minister comes to them, dragging along Prince Peter and Prince Rudolph, revealing that there was no threat; they will return to the Palace for the Jubilee. Everyone bids their friends goodbye (&quot;A Picture of Me Without You&quot; (Reprise)). The King and Queen cheer up by listening to a favorite old song of theirs (&quot;Me and Marie&quot;) before being arrested for bathing nude. As the prison burnt down, they are put in lion cages. With James&#x27; help, they knock out the zookeeper with a version of the King&#x27;s string trick and escape. Meanwhile, Eric Dare and the Princess tearfully say goodbye (&quot;When Love Comes Your Way&quot; (Reprise)), and Karen and Prince James share their last dance (&quot;It Was Just One of Those Things&quot;). At the Jubilee, Eric, Karen, Eva, and Charles are awarded Jubilee honors and the two young Princes are allowed to go to Radio City (&quot;Our Crown&quot; (Reprise)). The King attempts to perform his string trick, but resorts to singing &quot;Me and Marie&quot; instead, as the curtain falls on the joyful scene (&quot;Finale Ultimo&quot;).

The Broadway premiere opened at the Imperial Theatre on October 12, 1935, and closed on May 7, 1936, after 169 performances. Changes in the lead lessened its appeal. Produced by Sam H. Harris and Max Gordon, the production was staged by Hassard Short, who also was the lighting designer, with dialog directed by Monty Woolley, choreographed by Albertina Rasch and Tony De Marco, and with set design by Jo Mielziner.

The cast included
*Melville Cooper as the King,
*Mary Boland as the Queen,
*Charles Walters as Prince James,
*Margaret Adams as Princess Diana,
*May Boley as Eva Standing,
*Marc Plant as Charles Rausmiller,

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the musical&#x27;s Boston opening (in September 1935), writing about Hart&#x27;s book that it combines &quot;satire, sentiment and humor in good proportion.&quot; Porter&#x27;s score and lyrics were said to be &quot;original and tuneful.&quot; Special mention was made of Mary Boland: &quot;Miss Boland played the ingeniously sentimental matron with gusto and enthusiasm, wore royal robes or a one-piece bathing suit with equal aplomb, sang a bit, and danced with every sign of enjoyment.&quot;

It was considered &quot;one of the great theatrical events of the 1930s.&quot; Of the Broadway opening (on October 12, 1935), Brooks Atkinson (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) wrote that the show
&quot;is a rapturous masquerade... Each of the guilds that produce our luxurious musical shows has shared equally in the general excellence of an upper-class song-and-dance arcade... It is an excellent fable--good humored, slightly romantic and eminently pragmatic... The music is jaunty, versatile and imaginative... Mary Boland is the queen of the book and the performance is a carnival of comic delights.&quot; Burns Mantle of the &quot;NY Daily News&quot; declared &quot;Jubilee&quot; was &quot;the most satisfying musical comedy produced in an American theatre within the length of trustworthy memories.&quot; Reviewers admired the book, giving the show a strong plot and solid writing integrated with the music. They quickly picked &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; and &quot;Just One of Those Things&quot; as favorite songs.

==Later productions==
Despite its popular success, the musical was not signed by a theatrical leasing company for stock or amateur performances after its initial run. Performances between 1936 and 1948 were negotiated by the producers Max Gordon and Sam Harris. In 1948, the St. Louis Municipal Opera used the original orchestrations, but they were lost in transit to the Music Box Theatre. &quot;Jubilee&quot; became a lost show. It was not produced for 40 years afterward.

In 1985, The New Amsterdam Theatre Company hired Larry Moore to reconstruct the show. It was performed in 1986 as part of their series of classic musicals presented in concert at The Town Hall in New York. Alyson Reed played Karen, Carole Shelley was Eva, Patrick Quinn was Eric, and Roderick Cook was the Prime Minister. Rebecca Luker was in the cast.

Indiana University Opera staged the musical in 1992. 42nd Street Moon in San Francisco presented concert versions of &quot;Jubilee&quot; in 1993 and 1997 and a staged production in 2009.

In 1998, a concert version was staged at Carnegie Hall, New York City, for the benefit of the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis. Directed by Herbert Ross, with choreography by Danny Daniels, Lynne Taylor-Corbett and Pierre Dulaine, the cast included Bea Arthur as The Queen, Tyne Daly as Eva Standing, Sandy Duncan as Karen O&#x27;Kane, Michael Jeter as The King, Alice Ripley as The Princess, Stephen Spinella as Eric Dare, Bob Paris as Mowgli, and Philip Bosco as Prime Minister. New York&#x27;s &quot;Musicals Tonight!&quot; theatre troupe presented a staged concert in October 2004.

The show has been produced twice by Ian Marshall Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Lost Musicals In Concert&quot; series in London. The second production, using the BBC Concert Orchestra, was performed in 1999 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and broadcast by the BBC.

The musical played for five weeks in 2012 at the Tabard Theatre in Chiswick, London.

==Recordings==

<doc id="975972" wikidata="Q7875013" url="?curid=975972" title="USS Vammen">
<text>USS &quot;Vammen&quot; (DE-644) was a of the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
Clarence Earl Vammen Jr. was born on 17 October 1919 in Aberdeen, Washington. He attended Pomona Junior College in California before enlisting in the Naval Reserve on 17 February 1941 at Long Beach, Calif. After his initial duty at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base Long Beach, Seaman 2d Class Vammen was transferred to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida on 4 April for flight training. Detached on 19 August and transferred to Naval Air Station Miami, for further training, Vammen was appointed a naval aviator (heavier-than-air) on 23 September. Completing his instruction on 20 October, he accepted the rank of ensign that day.

Assigned to Advanced Carrier Training Group, Pacific Fleet, soon thereafter, Vammen continued his training until joining Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6), based on the aircraft carrier , on 28 April 1942. He joined the ship within two weeks of the completion of the famous Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 April 1942, and just before his carrier and proceeded south toward the Coral Sea to meet an expected Japanese thrust. The two flattops were too late to assist and in the critical Battle of the Coral Sea which took place from 4 to 8 May.

During the Battle of Midway Vammen, now assigned to Scouting Squadron 6 (VS-6), did not take part in the strikes of 4 June against the Imperial Japanese Navy carrier fleet. On Friday evening, 5 June, Vammen, flying a Douglas SBD Dauntless, with Aviation Machinists&#x27; Mate 2nd Class M. W. Clark in the rear seat took off with eight other planes of VS-6, as part of the strike launched to locate and sink what had been erroneously reported as two Japanese carriers. Subsequently, the SBDs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; found and attacked what they reported to be a &quot;Japanese CL&quot; (light cruiser)— a ship that turned out to be the destroyer &quot;Tanikaze&quot;. The Dauntlesses that made the dusk attack failed to score any hits with their 500-pound bombs on the twisting, turning destroyer. Vammen, who had never received instruction in night carrier recoveries, made his first night landing not on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but on &quot;Hornet&quot;.

The next morning, on 6 June, Vammen joined &quot;Hornet&quot;&#x27;s planes in attacking the fleeing Japanese heavy cruisers &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Mikuma&quot;, a strike that inflicted such severe damage on the latter that it sank later that day. Vammen and his gunner failed to return from that mission. For his part in the battle Vammen was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Vammen&quot; was laid down on 1 August 1943 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation; launched on 21 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Earle Morgan, aunt of the late Ensign Vammen; and commissioned on 27 July 1944.

==World War II==
Following commissioning, &quot;Vammen&quot; fitted out through mid-August 1944 and later conducted her shakedown out of San Diego, California, into late September before undergoing a post-shakedown availability at her builder&#x27;s yard. Underway for Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 13 October, the new destroyer escort convoyed SS &quot;Phillipa&quot; to the Hawaiian Islands before reporting for duty to Commander, Service Force, Pacific Fleet, on 21 October.

For the remainder of October and all of November, the destroyer escort trained out of Pearl Harbor, operating in company with various submarines and aircraft carriers, perfecting techniques of anti-submarine warfare and escort duty. She then escorted SS &quot;Cushman Davis&quot; via Funafuti in the Ellice Islands to Espiritu Santo, before she steamed independently to Pearl Harbor, arriving at the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s main base three days after Christmas 1944.

&quot;Vammen&quot; plane-guarded for early in January 1945 before escorting the merchantman SS &quot;Exira&quot; to Eniwetok in the Marshalls from 9 to 16 January. While returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Vammen&quot; responded to a radio request for assistance from which had an ill crewman. The destroyer escort rendezvoused with the landing ship at sea on 20 January and took the sick man on board. The following day, off Johnston Island, &quot;Vammen&quot; transferred the man to a hospital boat, sent from that outpost, for medical treatment ashore. The destroyer escort arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 23 January.

At the end of the month, &quot;Vammen&quot; sailed for the Marshall Islands, escorting Convoy PD-278-T, consisting of the attack transports and . Departing Pearl Harbor on 30 January, PD-278-T arrived at Eniwetok on 7 February. &quot;Vammen&quot; headed for Hawaii the next day and, on the 10th, relieved as escort for the escort carriers and en route. They subsequently reached Pearl Harbor on 17 February.

The destroyer escort conducted one more convoy escort run to the Marshalls before she participated in her first major action. She shepherded PD-310-T, which consisted of the attack transports , , and , from 22 February to 2 March, the day of their arrival at Eniwetok.

Three days later, she (as one of nine escorts) sortied with a 10-ship convoy bound for Ulithi and Kossol Roads. Detached on 9 March, she escorted the merchantman SS &quot;Westward Ho&quot; to Kossol Roads, and, two days later, departed the Palaus and proceeded to the Philippines in company with the landing ship and &quot;Westward Ho&quot;, reaching Rizal, Leyte, on 13 March.

After patrolling the entrance to Leyte Gulf from 14 to 18 March, &quot;Vammen&quot; underwent an availability at San Pedro Bay alongside tender . With those repairs completed within a week&#x27;s time, the destroyer escort sortied on 25 March, bound for Okinawa and her baptism of fire.

===Okinawa===
Steaming as part of the screen for Tractor Group &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Vammen&quot; reached the Ryukyus on 1 April, the day of the initial landings on Okinawa. Detached from duty with Task Unit 51.14.2 (TU 51.14.2), for which the ship&#x27;s commanding officer had been screen commander, &quot;Vammen&quot; was assigned to the western half of screening station A-39. Later that day, she received orders to screen LST Group &quot;Dog&quot; during its night retirement. While maneuvering at 15 knots through the congested transport area under poor visibility conditions, the destroyer escort struck a heavy floating object with her bow at 21:00. A few seconds later, an explosion occurred beneath her stern, as though a depth charge had exploded under the ship.

After noticing marked vibrations, &quot;Vammen&quot; reduced speed to 10 knots. Repair parties reported no evident damage, but the vibrations indicated damage to shafts or propellers. As it turned out, the ship&#x27;s starboard propeller had been damaged and required replacement. Nevertheless, she completed her assigned mission proceeding to rendezvous with the LST group on its night retirement.

At 06:45 the next day, she resumed her screening station, A-39, but because of her reduced speed capacity, was ordered to take station A-50. Fortunately for &quot;Vammen&quot;, she was never attacked by enemy aircraft.

&quot;Vammen&quot; remained on station off Okinawa until 8 April. Due to the frequent enemy air raids, her crew spent an average of 10 to 12 hours a day at their general quarters stations, but as Commander King noted in his report of the ship&#x27;s operations, &quot;no undue fatigue or effect on morale or efficiency&quot; resulted. Offered no opportunity to fire at enemy aircraft during her time off Okinawa, &quot;Vammen&quot; conducted two &quot;hedgehog&quot; attacks on suspected submarine contacts, neither with observable results.

With the additional problem of a burnt-out drive motor in her surface-search (SL) radar, &quot;Vammen&quot; departed Okinawa on 8 April, screening LST Group 17 to Leyte. Arriving at San Pedro Bay on 14 April, she underwent repairs alongside &quot;Markab&quot; before she was drydocked in &quot;ARD-16&quot; to have the damaged starboard propeller replaced. Undocking on the 17th, &quot;Vammen&quot; returned to Okinawa at the end of April, screening LST Group 41.

Detached from that escort duty on 2 May, &quot;Vammen&quot; received orders to head for the scene of a submarine sighting at 15:14 on the 5th. She arrived on the scene at 17:23, and commenced a search plan in company with , but found nothing. The ships abandoned the search at 11:00 the following day, and &quot;Vammen&quot; soon resumed her screening role off Okinawa.

The destroyer escort remained off Okinawa, screening incoming ships and off transport areas, for the rest of May. On 28 May, while anchored at the northern end of the transport area in Hagushi Bay, &quot;Vammen&quot; picked up Talk-Between-Ships (TBS) reports of incoming aircraft, &quot;bogies&quot;, commencing beyond 50 miles (90 km). A short while later, the destroyer escort&#x27;s radar picked up one enemy plane, a Kawasaki Ki-61 &quot;Tony&quot;, first at 10 miles (20 km) and then one mile away as it circled across the ship&#x27;s bow.

The &quot;Tony&quot; suddenly emerged from the low clouds on the escort&#x27;s starboard quarter, and all of &quot;Vammen&quot;&#x27;s 20-mm Oerlikons that could bear opened up, joining the other ships nearby in putting up a fierce barrage of fire. The &quot;Tony&quot; strafed a tug nearby but, hit in the tail and right wing, burst into flame, lost altitude, and crashed into the water without exploding, clear of any ships.

Underway on 3 June, &quot;Vammen&quot;, awarded an &quot;assist&quot; in the downing of the plane on 28 May, escorted an Okinawa-to-Leyte convoy between 3 and 8 June, sinking a Japanese mine with gunfire en route. After repairs alongside &quot;Markab&quot; and a docking in for repairs to her sound gear—which had been inoperative since 22 May—the destroyer escort sailed for Lingayen in company with sistership , on her way back to Okinawa.

For the remainder of June, &quot;Vammen&quot; performed the unglamorous but vital duty of screening transports and of providing local escort services to incoming convoys. She ultimately departed the Ryukyus in early July and steamed to Ulithi before returning once more to Okinawa on 15 July, commencing patrol at station D-l, off Buckner Bay, on 22 July.

Subsequently returning to Ulithi in early August, the destroyer escort returned to Okinawa on 12 August and, after fueling, got underway on 13 August as part of the screen for an Okinawa-to-Ulithi convoy. It was while underway with that convoy two days later that the ship received the welcome news of Japan&#x27;s capitulation. &quot;Vammen&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer recorded the event: &quot;1745, On basis of communique No. 467, all offensive action against Japanese ceased.&quot;

&quot;Vammen&quot; reached Ulithi on 18 August and, after escorting Convoy UOK (Ulithi to Okinawa) 52 to Okinawa from 27 to 31 August, returned to Ulithi at the beginning of September. Subsequently visiting Guam and Saipan, &quot;Vammen&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 9 November on her way back to the west coast of the United States.

The ship underwent a lengthy availability at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, that lasted into 1946. She shifted southward to San Diego and departed that port on 20 February, bound for the Hawaiian Islands, reaching Pearl Harbor on 27 February. She sailed from Oahu on 4 March, and proceeded via Guam to China.

&quot;Vammen&quot; supported the American occupation forces in their operations from the spring of 1946 into the autumn, touching at ports such as Tsingtao and Shanghai, China; and Kowloon. Departing from Shanghai on 1 July 1946, the destroyer escort reached Pearl Harbor on 16 July via Guam and Eniwetok. She then set out for the west coast of the US, reaching San Diego on 28 July.

The destroyer escort next underwent an availability at Terminal Island, California, and San Pedro in early September, and shifted to San Diego in mid-month. &quot;Vammen&quot; was subsequently decommissioned at San Diego on 3 February 1947 and placed in reserve. She was inactivated on 2 April 1947.

==Korean War==
The Korean War meant a new lease on life for &quot;Vammen&quot;; she was reactivated and heavily modified to enable her to perform a specialized anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role. With a redesigned bridge, trainable forward-firing ASW projectors (&quot;hedgehogs&quot;), and improved sonar capabilities, &quot;Vammen&quot; thus became one of the most modern ASW vessels in the fleet.

Recommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, on 15 February 1952, &quot;Vammen&quot; operated off the west coast, out of San Diego and in the southern California area, into the summer of the following year, training. On 19 July 1953, she left San Diego behind, bound for her first deployment to the Western Pacific (WestPac) since her re-commissioning.

After proceeding via Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Yokosuka, &quot;Vammen&quot; arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 23 August but got underway the next morning for the key port of Wonsan on the eastern coast of North Korea. She operated off Wonsan, performing patrol and gunfire support duties, from 25 August to 17 September before she returned to Sasebo.

&quot;Vammen&quot; returned to Wonsan at the end of October, and, after performing a second tour of gunfire support and patrol there, returned to the west coast of the United States. Departing Wonsan on 11 November, the destroyer escort reached San Diego on 2 December via the Shimonoseki Straits, Yokosuka, Midway and Pearl Harbor.

==1953 – 1961==
Over the next six years, &quot;Vammen&quot; alternated in training operations off the coast of California, operating primarily out of San Diego, and conducting regular WestPac deployments. In 1956, while in San Diego, &quot;Vammen&quot; was used in filming a TV drama, and in 1959 the &quot;Vammen&quot; and crew were also used in filming the Jerry Lewis comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot;. In 1960 &quot;Vammen&quot; appeared in the episode &quot;Beyond Limits&quot; of the TV series Sea Hunt.

The latter provided her with excellent training opportunities. In 1955 and again in 1958, she made cruises through the Western and Central Carolines, the Bonins, the northern Marianas, and the Volcano Islands, parts of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the Navy. She kept a figurative &quot;eye&quot; on local conditions on the various atolls and islands, keeping a lookout for illegal activities in trading and shipping. Her surveillance missions varied in format. On some occasions, she sent a landing party ashore via motor whaleboat or outboard motor-powered rubber raft; and, on other occasions, &quot;Vammen&quot; remained offshore while her men scanned the island with binoculars. During the former, a pharmacist&#x27;s mate (the ship&#x27;s doctor) accompanied the landing party to provide medical care and advice for the sick.

On another occasion, while en route to WestPac in company with , &quot;Vammen&quot; visited Lyttelton, New Zealand, the port of Christchurch. The two destroyer escorts remained there from 3 to 8 February 1958, while &quot;Vammen&quot; transferred 51 sacks of mail destined for Operation Deep Freeze personnel in Antarctica.

In 1959, &quot;Vammen&quot; footage appeared in the movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up the Ship&quot;, starring Jerry Lewis. Lewis portrayed an absentminded officer in the Navy who was accused by a member of Congress of somehow misplacing the ship.

In April 1960, &quot;Vammen&quot; was selected as a Group I Naval Reserve Training (NRT) ship; on 21 May, she was redesignated a Group II NRT ship. On 18 June 1960, the destroyer escort was de-commissioned and placed &quot;in service&quot;.

After becoming an NRT ship, &quot;Vammen&quot; soon began to provide training for reserve surface divisions of the 11th Naval District. Those men came on board for both dockside and underway training. On the third weekend of each month and for two weeks each summer, &quot;Vammen&quot; embarked her selected reserve crew. She then conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW), gunnery, and other shipboard training drills off the coast of California between Long Beach and San Diego. In August 1960, &quot;Vammen&quot; conducted her first annual two-week training cruise with her selected reserve crew embarked. For her performance during those evolutions, the destroyer escort received the highest grade assigned to an NRT ship of her type.

==Cold War: 1961 – 1962==
She subsequently conducted her second two-week cruise the following summer, 1961, ready for instant mobilization. That autumn, the Cold War tensions that escalated over the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and in the Far East (War in Vietnam (1959–1963)) resulted in the reactivation of 40 NRT ships for active duty. Accordingly, on 2 October 1961, &quot;Vammen&quot; was recommissioned at Long Beach.

Following her recommissioning, &quot;Vammen&quot; underwent her regularly scheduled overhaul at the Todd Shipyard. Transferred to Pearl Harbor as her new home on 15 December 1961, &quot;Vammen&quot; sailed for another WestPac deployment on 6 January 1962. She deployed with a hunter-killer group and arrived at Pearl on 12 January. She began refresher training soon thereafter.

Assigned to Escort Division 72 (CortDiv 72), &quot;Vammen&quot; sailed for the Philippines on 24 February. After logistics stops at Midway and Guam for fuel and minor voyage repairs, the destroyer escort reached Subic Bay on 11 March. After a brief period of upkeep, &quot;Vammen&quot; visited Manila in company with and from 16 to 18 March. On the 19th, the three ships got underway for the Gulf of Siam.

Arriving off the southern tip of South Vietnam on 21 March, &quot;Vammen&quot; and &quot;Charles E. Brannon&quot; relieved and on the following day and assumed the duties of training units of the small South Vietnamese Navy in that area. From that day until 9 April, &quot;Vammen&quot; remained on station in the Gulf of Siam, off the coast of South Vietnam, maintaining American presence in that area. Heavy pressure from Communist Viet Cong forces inside South Vietnam had brought about a commitment of force there as the United States sought to bolster the American-backed regime. After visiting Subic Bay for a week of upkeep and conducting a port visit to Hong Kong, &quot;Vammen&quot; returned to her station in the Gulf of Siam. Originally, the ship&#x27;s schedule had called for the ship to visit Japan and return to Pearl Harbor after visiting Hong Kong, but, as &quot;Vammen&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer reported &quot;... the efforts of &quot;Vammen&quot; and the other ex-NRT ships on the South Vietnam training mission were apparently of such value that it was decided to retain Escort Division 72 on the mission through mid-May.&quot;

There were further changes of plan afoot for &quot;Vammen&quot;, as was evidenced during the second deployment in the Gulf of Siam. On 13 May, &quot;Vammen&quot; and &quot;Charles E. Brannon&quot; were diverted from their training duties under Task Force 72 and were ordered to report for duty to commander, Task Group 76.5 (TG 76.5). Complying, the two destroyer escorts subsequently screened , , and while that group took a Marine Corps expeditionary force to Bangkok, Thailand. The 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, embarked in the amphibious group were sent to Thailand in an effort to provide the friendly regime with troops to deter any Communist moves across the Mekong River. Following that operation, &quot;Vammen&quot; and her sistership escorted TG 76.5 back to Subic Bay, arriving there on 23 May.

&quot;Vammen&quot; subsequently visited Yokosuka, Japan, and participated in Exercise Powerdive, with 7th Fleet units in the Japan area, before she returned via Midway Island to her home port, Pearl Harbor, on 18 June. At Pearl from 18 June to 11 July, &quot;Vammen&quot; enjoyed the longest consecutive in-port period since February that year, undergoing much-needed repairs and maintenance. On 11 July, &quot;Vammen&quot;, in company with , , and &quot;Wiseman&quot;, sailed for the west coast of the United States.

After her arrival at Long Beach on 17 July, &quot;Vammen&quot; was de-commissioned on 1 August 1962, resuming her role as an NRT ship.

==Naval Reserve Training Ship (NRT) 1962-1971==
For the next seven years, &quot;Vammen&quot; continued her duties as an 11th Naval District NRT ship, based at Long Beach, and operating primarily in the Long Beach-Los Angeles-San Pedro area. During that time, she ranged as far north as British Columbia and as far south as Ensenada, Mexico.

On 1 August 1963, while in convoy with other NRT ships of the 11th Naval District en route to Pearl Harbor, Vammen lost steering control and collided with USS Tingey (DD-539) doing major damage to Tingey, but inflicting no personnel casualties. Tingey returned to San Diego and was subsequently removed from service, the damage being too severe to be economically repaired. Vammen&#x27;s bow was repaired in Long Beach Naval Shipyard.

Age ultimately caught up with the veteran destroyer escort; and, in the summer of 1969, she was adjudged unfit for further service. Placed out of service on 12 July 1969, &quot;Vammen&quot;″s NRT crew was transferred to ; and the ship herself was turned over to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, San Diego. Struck from the Navy List on 12 July 1969, &quot;Vammen&quot;″s stripped hulk was utilized in a Condor missile test on 4 February 1971 and, as a result of the damage suffered on that date, sank on 18 February.

The wreck of the USS Vammen was found by scuba divers on 1 August 2010 in about 80 metres of water off San Clemente Island.

==Awards==
&quot;Vammen&quot; (DE-644) earned one battle star for her World War II service and one engagement star for her Korean War service.

<text>M&amp;T Bank Corporation (Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company) is an American bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. It operates 950+ branches in 12 states and Washington D.C. across the Eastern United States, from Maine to Virginia. Until May 1998, the bank&#x27;s holding company was named First Empire State Corporation.

M&amp;T Bank has been profitable in every quarter since 1976. Other than Northern Trust, M&amp;T was the only bank in the S&amp;P 500 Index not to lower its dividend during the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

The bank owns the Buffalo Savings Bank building in downtown Buffalo, Bridgeport Center in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and the M&amp;T Tech Hub in the Seneca One Tower. It also sponsors M&amp;T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens, as well as M&amp;T Bank Auditorium and M&amp;T Bank Atrium of the University at Buffalo. M&amp;T Bank is the official bank of the Buffalo Bills in Western New York and of their home Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park. Wilmington Trust is a subsidiary of M&amp;T Bank Corporation, offering global corporate and institutional services, private banking, investment management, and fiduciary services.

==History==
===19th century===
In the mid-19th century, few banking options existed for the growing number of manufacturers in the city of Buffalo. As a result, businessmen Pascal Pratt and Bronson Rumsey founded M&amp;T Bank in 1856 as &quot;Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company&quot;. Henry Martin, former president of the Attica and Buffalo Railroad, was appointed the first president and assigned a salary of $1,000 a year. The company opened its first office on August 29 of that year at 2 East Swan Street in Buffalo. In 1885, Martin retired as president, at the age of 83, and was succeeded by Pascal Pratt, who had served as Vice President since the bank was formed.

===20th century===
In 1901, the bank built a new headquarters on a site purchased for $210,000 near the southwest corner of Main and Swan Streets in Buffalo. The granite neo-classical building was designed by architect E. B. Green of Green &amp; Wicks. By 1914, Robert Livingston Fryer was the bank&#x27;s President. In 1917, Harry T. Ramsdell, the bank&#x27;s fourth president, served as a district chairman for a special subscription committee of the national Liberty Loan program.
Following the 1925 merger with Fidelity Trust, the $100 million company was headed by Fidelity&#x27;s President, 36-year-old Lewis G. Harriman. Harriman and a group of investors including A. H. Schoellkopf, from the founding family of the Niagara Mohawk power company, and James V. Forrestal, who would become the first U.S. Secretary of Defense, own enough shares to control both Fidelity and M&amp;T.

In 1961, M&amp;T acquired an entire block on Main Street between North Division and Eagle Streets in downtown Buffalo and began plans for a $12 million skyscraper to become the bank&#x27;s new headquarters. In 1963, architect Minoru Yamasaki, who was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine that year as he was designing the World Trade Center in New York City, was retained by M&amp;T to design its new building in Buffalo, which was completed in 1967. In 1964, Charles W. Millard succeeded Harriman as chairman of M&amp;T.

In 1969, M&amp;T&#x27;s stockholders voted to create a multi-bank holding company known as First Empire State Corporation. In 1983, the bank which had assets of $2 billion and operated 60 offices, named Robert G. Wilmers as chairman and CEO, a position he held until his death in December 2017. In 1995, First Empire formed a national bank subsidiary, M&amp;T Bank, N.A.
===21st century===
In 2008, M&amp;T received a $600 million investment by the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and M&amp;T assumed another $482 million in TARP obligations from its acquisitions. In 2012, the bank repaid $700 million of TARP funds.

In June 2014, a U.S. District Judge ordered M&amp;T Bank to forfeit $560,000 that had been laundered through its Perry Hall, Maryland, branch; from 2011 to 2013, Deanna Bailey went to the branch and had head teller Sabrina Fitts convert cash amounts from $20,000 to $100,000 into larger bills. Fitts accepted a 1% transaction fee in exchange for not filing a currency transaction report. This violated the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970.

On December 16, 2017, non-executive chairman Robert T. Brady became acting chairman and CEO. On December 20, 2017, René F. Jones was appointed chairman and CEO.

In 2021, M&amp;T Bank contributed $33.9 million to over 3,000 nonprofit organizations across eight states and the District of Columbia. The bank has donated more than $279.4 million to nonprofits over the past decade, and over $437.5 million to nonprofits over the past two decades.

In May 2022, M&amp;T announced a $25 million initiative to support lower-income communities and underrepresented groups. The new Amplify Fund will be deployed over three years with most of the funds set to be distributed to Connecticut-based organizations and other north-eastern states where People’s United had operated. M&amp;T announced that $9 to $11 million will be distributed by the end of 2022, with the rest of the funds to be distributed over the next two year and expects to fund approximately 60 to 70 organizations in the initiatives first phase.

In August 2022, M&amp;T announced a partnership with Stefon Diggs; Diggs will serve as a brand ambassador for M&amp;T’s “Football Brings Us Together” campaign.

In October 2022, M&amp;T launched its Multicultural Banking Center in East Hartford, Connecticut; the bank has 118 multicultural locations.

In 2022, M&amp;T was listed as one of the &quot;Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion&quot; by the Disability Equality Index (DEI) for its fourth consecutive year.

<text>James Alison Hayes (born December 21, 1946) is an American politician and lawyer. He is a Republican from Louisiana.

==Background==

Born in Lafayette, Hayes graduated from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then the University of Southwestern Louisiana). He served in the Louisiana Air National Guard from 1968 to 1974.

==Career==

In 1986, Hayes was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat to fill the seat vacated by John Berlinger Breaux. In 1990, Hayes again defeated David Thibodaux. The tally was 103,308 (58 percent) for Hayes, 68,430 (38 percent) for Thibodaux, and 7,364 (4 percent) for another Democrat, Johnny Myers. In 1992, Hayes as a Democrat defeated his own brother, Fredric Hayes, a Republican, with whom he had quarreled. Hayes received 84,149 (73 percent) to his brother&#x27;s 23,870 (21 percent). A second Republican, Robert J. &quot;Bob&quot; Nain, polled 7,184 votes (6 percent).

In 1994, Hayes defeated a comeback bid by former Congressman Clyde C. Holloway of Forest Hill in Rapides Parish, Holloway&#x27;s Louisiana&#x27;s 8th congressional district having been eliminated and dismembered after the 1990 United States Census. Hayes polled 72,424 votes (53 percent) to Holloway&#x27;s 54,253 (40 percent).

Hayes left the Democrats on December 1, 1995, and joined the Republicans. He was one of several Conservative Democratic lawmakers, mostly from the South, including Nathan Deal of Georgia, Mike Parker of Mississippi, Greg Laughlin of Texas and fellow Louisianan Billy Tauzin, to switch to the Republican party during that time, as the Republicans had taken majorities in Congress in the 1994 elections. Hayes then ran for the United States Senate in 1996. He finished fifth in the nonpartisan blanket primary with almost 72,000 votes (6 percent). Republican Louis E. &quot;Woody&quot; Jenkins of Baton Rouge and Democrat Mary Landrieu of New Orleans then advanced to the tightly contested general election, which Landrieu narrowly won under protest.

In 1997, when Hayes retired from the House after unsuccessfully running for the Senate, his House seat was taken by Democrat Chris John of Crowley in Acadia Parish.

Hayes continues to be politically involved as a lobbyist. He appeared at a December 2008 event to raise funds for the successful reelection in 2010 of Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter.

<doc id="975995" wikidata="Q175278" url="?curid=975995" title="Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle">
<text>Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle is a 1994 American biographical drama film directed by Alan Rudolph from a screenplay written by Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn. The film stars Jennifer Jason Leigh as writer Dorothy Parker and depicts the members of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of writers, actors and critics who met almost every weekday from 1919 to 1929 at Manhattan&#x27;s Algonquin Hotel.

The film was an Official Selection at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was a critical but not a commercial success. Leigh won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress.

Peter Benchley, who plays editor Frank Crowninshield, was the grandson of humorist Robert Benchley, who once worked underneath Crowninshield. Actor Wallace Shawn is the son of William Shawn, the longtime editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Plot==
During the Prohibition era in the United States, the Algonquin Hotel is a hub for the &quot;Vicious Circle,&quot; a group of intellectuals. Among them is Dorothy Parker, a successful writer. Dealing with a troubled marriage to a drug addict, she finds solace in the genuine friendship of Robert Benchley, a colleague at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The &quot;Vicious Circle&quot; successfully stages an improvisational theatrical performance, leading Dorothy to cross paths with Charles MacArthur. Their relationship results in abandonment and an abortion, further shaping her sharp and skeptical character.

Amidst depression, Dorothy attempts suicide, but Robert intervenes, choosing not to pursue a romantic involvement due to fear of potential heartbreak. Without the prospect of love, Dorothy and Robert navigate separate paths, seeking solace in different relationships and experiences. In 1945, Dorothy discovers Robert&#x27;s death from cirrhosis of the liver, adding another layer of hardship. Attempts at psychoanalysis fail to alleviate the darkness within her. In 1958, aged and increasingly isolated in New York, she receives a significant literary award.

==Cast==
Given the historical impact of many of the people portrayed in the film, the ensemble nature of the cast led to opening credits displaying all 30 actors listed above. Other historical characters, in brief appearances, included portrayals by Keith Carradine as Will Rogers, Jon Favreau as Elmer Rice, lead character Robert Benchley&#x27;s grandson – &quot;Jaws&quot; author Peter Benchley – as Frank Crowninshield, Malcolm Gets as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gisele Rousseau as Polly Adler.

==Production==

=== Development ===
Director Alan Rudolph was fascinated with the Algonquin Round Table as a child when he discovered Gluyas Williams&#x27; illustrations in a collection of Robert Benchley&#x27;s essays. Speaking in 1995, he said &quot;the Algonquin Hotel round table, what it symbolised, and the ripple effect that went out from it, was probably up there in the 50 most significant events of the century&quot;. After making &quot;The Moderns&quot;, a film about American expatriates in 1920s Paris, Rudolph wanted to tackle a fact-based drama set in the same era. He began work on a screenplay with novelist and former &quot;Washington Star&quot; journalist Randy Sue Coburn about legendary writer Dorothy Parker. In 1992, Rudolph attended a Fourth of July party hosted by filmmaker Robert Altman, who introduced him to actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. Rudolph was surprised by her physical resemblance to Parker and was impressed by her knowledge of the Jazz Age. Leigh was so committed to doing the film that she agreed to make it for &quot;a tenth of what I normally get for a film&quot;.

The screenplay originally focused on the platonic relationship between Parker and Robert Benchley, but this did not appeal to any financial backers. There still was no interest even when Altman came on board as producer. The emphasis on Parker was the next change to the script, but Rudolph still had no luck finding financing for &quot;a period biography of a literate woman.&quot; Altman used his clout to persuade Fine Line Features and Miramax—two studios he was making films for—to team, with the former releasing &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; domestically and the latter handling foreign distribution. Altman claimed that he forced the film to be made by putting his own money into it, adding, &quot;I put other projects of mine hostage to it. I did a lot of lying.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Rudolph shot the film in Montreal because the building facades in its old city most closely resembled period New York City. Full financing was not acquired until four weeks into principal photography.

The film&#x27;s large cast followed Leigh&#x27;s lead and agreed to work for much lower than their usual salaries. Rudolph invited them to write their own dialogue, which resulted in a chaotic first couple of days of principal photography. Actor Campbell Scott remembered &quot;Everyone hung on to what they knew about their characters and just sort of threw it out there.&quot; Actress Jennifer Beals discussed this in her appearance on the Jon Favreau program &quot;Dinner for Five&quot;, where she stated that while much dialogue was improvised in the style of the real-life characters the actors were playing, many of these characters were not integral to the plot. As such, many of the actors had much larger parts that were edited down to nearly nothing in the film’s final cut.

During the film’s 40-day shoot, the cast stayed in a run-down hotel dubbed Camp Rudolph and engaged in all-night poker games. Leigh chose not to participate in these activities, preferring to stay in character on and off camera. She did a great amount of research for the role and said &quot;I wanted to be as close to her as I possibly could.&quot; To this end, Leigh stayed at the Algonquin Hotel for a week and read Parker&#x27;s entire body of work. In addition, the actress listened repeatedly to the two existing audio recordings of Parker in order to perfect the writer&#x27;s distinctive voice. Leigh found that Parker &quot;had a sensibility that I understand very, very well. A sadness. A depression.&quot;

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a approval rating based on reviews, with an average score of . A rough cut of &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; was screened at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival where it divided film critics. It was rumored afterwards that Leigh re-recorded several scenes that were too difficult to understand because of her accent but she denied that this happened. The film was an Official Selection at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

For her performance in the film, Leigh was nominated for both the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead.

<doc id="976020" wikidata="Q1807119" url="?curid=976020" title="Gaper">
<text>A gaper (Dutch pronunciation: ) is a stone or wooden figurehead, often depicting a Moor, Muslim, or North African. The figurehead first appeared in the late 16th century as a hangout sign used outside the storefronts of drug stores in the Netherlands. The meaning of &quot;gaper&quot; is the same in English; the figurehead is always displayed with an open mouth, sometimes with a pill resting on his tongue.  

The gaper&#x27;s gaping tongue could represent the intake of medicine and grimace represents the bitter taste of the medicine. The gaper takes on various appearances that are symbolic of the origin for the pharmacist’s practice or medicinal ingredients. There are stories of the gaper as a symbol of the pharmacist’s traveling &quot;quack&quot; or helper. Recently, gaper figureheads have been stolen or removed from storefronts. Now, few remain within public view in the city of Amsterdam. Outside museum collections, fewer than 50 can be seen on buildings. Some have now lent their names to cafes, such as &quot;De Vergulde Gaper&quot; in Amsterdam.

== Origin ==
Turkish fashion, Japonerie, and Chinoiserie are said to be a source of inspiration for creating the gapers. The origin of the gaper, mostly Southern or exotic, symbolizes the origin of the ingredients used in the drugstore&#x27;s medicines. During the 17th century, Western European trade with continents such as Asia and Africa introduced new spices from far and unknown places. Many exotic medicine components entered Europe through trade with the Ottoman Empire. Europeans traded with the Ottomans for senna leaves, opium, saffron, turmeric, and various resins, gums, and minerals, incense, myrrh, and bitumen. The spices and ingredients were brought back to Europe and later dried and sold by a chemist.
=== Design, style, and symbolism ===
Each gaper is hand cut and painted using a stone or wood base. They are usually displayed with an open mouth or with their tongues sticking out. Recent research indicates that the open mouth originates from the way the chemist&#x27;s customers gaped with astonishment when they saw the enormous variety of exotic substances inside. Gapers have facial expressions ranging from innocent to humorous to suffering. Gapers takes on various appearances with each instance being unique. Their individual designs are claimed to be specific to the specialties of the drugstore.

The oriental gapers are categorized between two identities: the Muslim and the Moor, both referring to people from the Maghreb in North-West Africa. Gapers with dark brown or black skin were used to represent the moors. The common oriental gaper often wore a turban with gold earrings. The turban confirmed an exotic origin that suggested the origin of the medicines to customers.

There are also many white gapers, often looking very ill with a pale skin color or having a facial expression of suffering and pain. These symbolize the patients of the chemist.

There were also &#x27;golden&#x27; gapers, gapers with a crown and gapers with a monkey on their shoulder. Although women have taken up the chemist&#x27;s profession since 1950, in Holland, few gapers depict a female. Before 1950, the profession of chemist was an exclusively male preserve. A law of 1865 prohibited women from following education to become a chemist. The first female chemist in the Netherlands (also one of the first female retailers) was Mia Ranke, who opened her chemist&#x27;s shop in 1934. The gaper referring to illness or a sick patient commonly wore a hat with a hanging point with a tassel or pom-pom attached to it. Some gapers were depicted in uniform, as a fire brigade, police or a Roman soldier. In the French era (1795-1813) there was a push towards a national policy on medicine sales. The gapers in uniform were introduced during the second half of the 19th century after the government extended authority on the sale of medicines.

The gaper had several identities that suggest background information or a story to the onlooker. The gaper as a jester would &quot;refer to the helper of the traveling person or quack&quot;. The helper acted as a patient who, for example, would picture the miracle provided and instantly healed his illness. This whole play was accompanied by many theatrical gestures and grimaces. Then the quack called everyone who wanted to hear how well the treatment worked, to pull in as many customers as possible. The traveling quack would settle in a store with a wooden sign of the trusted helper placed by the store’s front door. As a symbol for the jester or help, the gaper would perform silly acts outside the store or in privacy to entertain customers and bring in more business. The Oriental dressed gaper possibly refers to the use of ingredients such as aloe vera, opium and gum arabic in medicines. It would &quot;reference to the origin of the opium that is in the store sold in the form of sleeping dumplings.&quot; It is difficult to say if all the different types of gapers have been around since the beginning. It is also possible that most of the different characters were a later development.

== Use ==
The gaper in the late 16th-century functioned as a hangout out sign on the street. Not only did the figurehead communicate information about the origin of the medicines, but it was also a tool for luring in customers. In this period there were no house numbers. The gaper served as a hangout known as a recognizable point for business. Pharmacies often decorated their storefronts with &#x27;rarities&#x27; to invoke customer curiosities. Exotic items such as a stuffed crocodile or tortoise, ostrich eggs, deer antlers, narwhal teeth, sawfish teeth, elk legs, and peacock feathers were popular decorations. Some say that the gaper was used to taunt non-buying in the street. The gaper could have also served as a mirror image of the drugstore&#x27;s pharmacist. Historical images show that the cap with a hanging point and tassel, similar to some hats depicted on gapers, was regularly worn by the 16th-century pharmacists.

=== Saturated market ===
Beginning in 1840, the demand for medicine quickly became unbalanced. This caused many drugstores to close, taking the gaper figureheads with them. The Act on the Exercise of Medicine in 1865 declared that the pharmacy had to be separate from the drugstore. Pharmacists were required to have a diploma, if not, then they were no longer considered a chemist. This caused the drug stores to change their appearance. The pharmacy displayed the mortar as a symbol for the ability to prepare medicines, while the druggists continued to use the gaper as a symbol. This caused a large decline in the numbers of gapers left in the cities.

== Controversy ==
Recently, gaper figureheads have been stolen from storefronts. However, some have been later returned to new locations throughout the Netherlands. The gaper on the facade of Wijde Heisteeg 4 was stolen and delivered back in 2004 on the sidewalk outside the Municipal Archive on the Amsteldijk. There are stories of gapers being vandalized and used for jokes. A gaper from the Wolvenstraat in Amsterdam was pushed off of its platform by pranksters in March 1960. In 1830, a gaper was stuffed with gunpowder by a group of students and then blown up in the middle of the street. In 1895, the gaper on Heiligeweg 42 was given a large piece of liver sausage in its mouth. The gaper at this address also disappeared in 2008, there is still no clarity as to where it has gone. The reasoning for theft and associating the gaper with jokes are also unclear.

There is speculation that the disappearance of the gaper figureheads is caused by the weather. The gapers are hung outside storefronts and exposed to rain for long periods of time. This has caused many wooden gaper figureheads to rot or split. This is clearly visible with some preserved figureheads in museum archives. The decaying or splitting causes the gaper to fall completely apart over time. Some gapers were protected with a layer of lead-mix and flaxseed oil over the paint. Others received a lead plate on top of their hats so the rain did not end up directly on the wood.

Some gapers disappeared during the Second World War. The gaper that was hanging on Lange Delft in Middelburg was lost in 1940 during a bombing. Made in 1693, it was the oldest preserved gaper in the Netherlands. The gaper on the corner of Gasthuisstraat in Gorinchem disappeared one morning during the war. It is speculated that it was taken as a war booty, or maybe for wood in someone&#x27;s stove.

There is still uncertainty about the origin and historical reasoning for the gaper. According to folklore, people used to hang monsters with their tongue sticking out off of buildings to ward off evil spirits. Some researchers explore the gaper in connection to certain medieval folklore stories. However, there still isn&#x27;t much solid evidence as to why certain types of gapers were depicted and why the gaper became the figurehead of pharmacists drug supply.

== Conservation ==
The gaper is now a historical collector’s item. The Royal Archeology Society in Amsterdam received a gaper in both 1882 and 1883. Meanwhile, the Museum of Antiquities in Groningen was given a gaper in 1891 and 1892. Also, Oudheidkundige Vereniging Flehite in Amersfoort received a gaper in 1893. The Haarlem chemist Anton van Os (1889-1982), for example, gathered at least 50 gapers from all over the country from the 1930s until his death. Now about 120 copies from before 1925 have been retained.

<text>Designer stubble is a facial hair style which is a short growth of beard, aimed to affect a rugged masculine or deliberately unkempt appearance. In the late 20th century it was popularized by singer George Michael and actor Don Johnson, the style later regained popularity after being worn by actor Tom Cruise in the 2000s. Several companies now manufacture beard trimmers designed specifically to maintain the designer stubble look. Typically created by trimming the beard to a length of 13 mm, designer stubble is roughly three days of growth, in contrast with the shorter &quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow&quot;.

<text>Gene C. Amondson (October 15, 1943 – July 20, 2009) was a painter, woodcarver, Christian minister and prohibition activist, who was the 2004 US presidential nominee for one faction of the Prohibition Party and the nominee of the unified party in 2008.

The son of a logger, Amondson was born into a Pacific Northwest lumberjack culture laden with alcoholism. He became interested in the temperance movement while attending Divinity School. After establishing himself as a preacher and artist in the community of Vashon Island, Washington, Amondson began touring the nation reenacting Billy Sunday sermons and attending events dressed as the Grim Reaper to protest alcohol corporations.

Amondson&#x27;s activism attracted notice from the Prohibition Party, which had been divided into two factions in 2003. In 2004, Amondson received the presidential nomination of the larger faction. On Election Day, he tallied over a thousand votes and finished in third place in several Louisiana parishes. With the death of the other faction leader in 2007, the party reunified. In 2008, Amondson again received the party&#x27;s presidential nomination, but fell short of his 2004 vote total.

==Early life==
Gene Amondson was born to Owen and Ruby Amondson in Morton, Washington near the city of Centralia. His mother was a German American homemaker, originally from Nebraska and his father, who was nicknamed &quot;Red&quot;, was a Norwegian American logger, an industry then rampant with alcoholism. As a child, neither of Gene&#x27;s parents drank, but he saw drunken logger fights and attended school with children neglected by alcoholic parents. In addition, he remembered witnessing a drunk logger molest a classmate when Amondson was five years old.

Amondson was also exposed to politics. His uncle, Orville &quot;Porky&quot; Amondson was elected and served as sheriff in Lewis County, and his brother Neil served in the Washington State Senate as a Republican.

Amondson attended Warner Pacific College in Portland, Oregon, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology. In college, he occasionally drank wine. His anti-alcohol views did not take root until he attended Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky in 1966, and learned about temperance leader and preacher Billy Sunday. Amondson estimated that after divinity school, he drank beer about twice a year. In the 1970s, he moved to the liberal community of Vashon Island, Washington, where he began preaching at Cove Road Church.

==Activism==

After moving to Vashon Island, Amondson grew closer to the temperance movement. He started touring the nation reenacting the Billy Sunday sermons &quot;Get on the Water Wagon&quot;, &quot;Booze&quot;. and &quot;The Sermon Against Alcohol&quot;. He visited churches, prisons, schools, and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to spread the message of temperance. In addition, he traveled to New Zealand on a Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union-financed trip, and toured Africa.


In protest of alcohol, Amondson often stood outside liquor establishments dressed as the Grim Reaper. He once stood outside a courtroom as the figure after a couple sued Jim Beam claiming its product caused their son to be born mentally retarded. During a 1989 interview, Amondson explained that he did not protest the individuals that drank, but the large corporations that distributed liquor. In 2005, he led a movement to stop the Washington legislature from allowing alcohol to be sold on Sundays, but was unsuccessful. Because of the passage, Amondson predicted &quot;a lot more alcohol will be sold, [and] a few more children will suffer.&quot;

On Vashon Island, Amondson provided low rent housing for people with low income. He appeared in court a few times for zoning difficulties relating to the housing complexes but received legal aid from the Interfaith Council on Homelessness. Amondson was known to drive around Vashon Island in a Honda Civic accessorized with a fake elk head on the front and a license plate that read &quot;Vote Dry.&quot; The car was also decorated with homemade bumper stickers that read &quot;Dumb People Drink&quot; and &quot;Your Kids Need You Sober.&quot; While driving past taverns, he regularly honked the car horn twice in protest. In 2008, the car was installed with a hydrogen conversion kit that allowed it to be fueled by gasoline and water using electrolysis, significantly improving gas mileage. Amondson&#x27;s car was one of the first in the nation to be fitted with such a kit.

==Presidential campaigns==

===2004===

In 2003, Amondson was approached by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party&#x27;s only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge&#x27;s leadership of the party. Hedges&#x27; faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party&#x27;s goals. Dodge had run as the party&#x27;s nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges&#x27; faction. Dodge received the other faction&#x27;s nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but it had already been filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was &quot;probably a very nice man ... [but] he may not have known exactly what he was getting into.&quot; Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a &quot;good man&quot; with whom he shared the same message, but argued, &quot;Dodge is just not getting the job done. He&#x27;s too old. We need to send it to an earlier generation.&quot;

While speaking with the media during his campaign, Amondson voiced his anti-alcohol message and attempted to address concerns that prohibition increases crime. In an AP interview, he explained that during Prohibition, &quot;the budget was balanced, prisons were emptied, mental institutions emptied and cirrhosis of the liver declined.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store.&quot; Amondson made an appearance on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with comedian Jon Stewart. He spoke with correspondent Ed Helms who joked with the candidate. During the segment, Amondson remarked, &quot;alcohol cuts the supply of oxygen to the brain and puts you in a kind of retarded state.&quot; A short clip followed that showed Amondson in his Grim Reaper attire. Earl Dodge also appeared on the show in a separate interview with Helms.

The race between Amondson and Dodge was viewed as a way to determine which faction would lead the party in the future. Amondson achieved ballot access in Louisiana as the nominee of the Prohibition Party and in Colorado as the nominee of the Concerns of People Party. Dodge achieved ballot access only in Colorado, where he was listed as the nominee of the Prohibition Party. Overall, Amondson won the contest, collecting 1,896 (1,512 of those were from Louisiana) votes compared to Dodge&#x27;s 140. As expected, Amondson placed well behind both major candidates (George W. Bush received 1.1 million votes, and John Kerry received over 1 million votes). He placed eighth in a slate of 12 candidates on Colorado&#x27;s ballot (Dodge placed last, even though it was his home state). Amondson&#x27;s third-place finish in four Louisiana parishes was the first time since 1960 that the Prohibition Party nominee for President out polled-all other third party candidates for president in any county.

===2008===

Amondson was nominated for President at the 2008 Prohibition Party National Convention in Indianapolis. About 10 to 15 people attended the event. Earl Dodge died late in 2007, which reunified the split party. Similar to 2004, Amondson&#x27;s based his campaign on media interviews. He spoke with &quot;Wikinews&quot; in June 2008, admitting that third party candidates such as himself have no chance of winning elections. Instead, he remarked, they &quot;say wise things.&quot; When given a choice, Amondson favored the election of a Republican over a Democrat because of the policies on Israel and the ideological difference in justices nominated to the Supreme Court. Amondson wanted former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as his running mate, but the designation went to activist Leroy Pletten.

During the summer, Amondson campaigned in Louisiana and walked Bourbon Street dressed as the Grim Reaper in protest of alcohol. While in New Orleans, he filmed a documentary with his three sons. In interviews, Amondson took stands on issues other than alcohol. He declared support for the War in Iraq and tougher immigration laws, and advocated limits on divorce, an increased role of religion in schools and a decrease in government welfare programs. In an August interview with &quot;Weekend America&quot;, he explained his platform, &quot;[w]e want to have protected borders and keep our gun rights and a lot of conservative things, but the main thing is help America realize that 95 percent of violent crime is connected with alcohol.&quot;

After John McCain selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate, Amondson complimented the Republican for picking a &quot;beautiful woman.&quot; Despite his own campaign, Amondson effectively endorsed McCain, revealing he would probably vote for McCain. Amondson attained ballot access in Colorado, Louisiana and Florida by Election Day, and received a total of 653 votes overall.

==Personal life==
Amondson described himself as a &quot;red-neck, Bible-thumbing preacher.&quot; He was married for 23 years and had four sons and one daughter, before divorcing. One of his sons died in infancy, and his remaining four children became involved in the motion picture industry upon adulthood.

Amondson appeared as a guest on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 1993 after writing a letter to the show expressing his interest in the 40,000 single women who entered a contest hoping to win a date with five widowers from Seattle. In the letter, which left &quot;Oprah&quot; staffers &quot;quite interested&quot; and &quot;surprised,&quot; Amondson explained he was lonely and wanted someone &quot;willing to work to help pay the taxes ... and my child support.&quot; On the show, he discussed his artwork, and was later invited for a second appearance. According to Amondson, following the appearance, he received hundreds of letters.

In his later years, Amondson split his time between Vashon Island and Alaska, where he hunted and found landscapes to paint. He cited painters John Singer Sargent and Joaquín Sorolla as his artistic influences. In addition, Amondson took an interest in woodcarving. His life-sized works can be found throughout Vashon Island. Along with painting and woodcarving, Amondson was an avid pie baker and published a book compiling his mother&#x27;s pie recipes.

===Death===
On July 18, 2009, Amondson, who had previously been diagnosed with hypertension, suffered a stroke which caused him to fall into a coma. He died two days later at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, aged 65. He was survived by his mother, his two brothers, his sister and four children. His funeral took place July 25 at the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Vashon Island.

<text>The Eastbank Esplanade (officially Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade) is a pedestrian and bicycle path along the east shore of the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States. Running through the Kerns, Buckman, and Hosford-Abernethy neighborhoods, it was conceived as an urban renewal project to rebuild the Interstate 5 bicycle bypass washed out by the Willamette Valley Flood of 1996. It was renamed for former Portland mayor Vera Katz in November 2004 and features a statue of her near the Hawthorne Bridge.

==Description==
The project, designed by landscape architects Mayer/Reed, cost $30 million, of which $10 million built a lower deck on the Steel Bridge. The esplanade extends from the Steel Bridge () to the Hawthorne Bridge (). The south end connects to the Springwater Corridor, a rail trail that runs south to Sellwood, then east to Gresham, then south to Boring. The esplanade includes a floating walkway, the longest of its kind in the United States. Connected to this is a public dock. Thirteen markers along the esplanade correspond to the eastside street grid.

== History ==
Construction began in October 1998, and the walkway was dedicated in May 2001.

The esplanade was closed for 21 days due to high river levels in 2011, the first time it had been closed since it was built.

On the same day in February 2015, two dead bodies were discovered along the esplanade. The events appear to be unrelated.

==Public art==
Public artworks installed along the esplanade include &quot;Alluvial Wall&quot;, &quot;Echo Gate&quot;, the &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; sculpture, the statue of Vera Katz and &quot;Stack Stalk&quot;.

<text>The Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) is a Near Threatened species of waterfowl in the tribe Tadornini of subfamily Anserinae. It is found in every mainland South American country except Chile, French Guiana, Suriname, and Uruguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Orinoco goose&#x27;s taxonomy is unsettled. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC) and BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; (HBW) place it alone in the genus &quot;Neochen&quot;. However, based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society and the Clements taxonomy place it and the Andean goose in the resurrected genus &quot;Oressochen&quot;. The IOC and HBW place the Andean goose in the genus &quot;Chloephaga&quot;.

Two fossil relatives have been described from Pleistocene sites in South America, &quot;Neochen pugil&quot; and &quot;N. debilis&quot;.

The Orinoco goose is monotypic.

==Description==

The Orinoco goose is long. Males weigh about and females about . Adult males have an off-white head, neck, and breast with slight buffy streaks on the nape and buffy scalloping on the breast. Their mantle is gray with white scalloping. They have an orange band across the upper mantle and onto the sides of the breast and flanks and a crescent of dark brown behind the flanks. Their undertail coverts are white. Their wings are black with a wide white speculum. Also, their bill has a black maxilla and a mostly red mandible and their legs and feet are bright salmon red. Adult females have a similar pattern as the males but have a drab wash on their crown and nape, less orange on the flanks, and darker scalloping on the sides of the belly. Their legs and feet are more a dull orange than bright red.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Orinoco goose is found from Venezuela south through Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, and Bolivia into far northern Argentina and in a broad swath across central Brazil. An isolated population spans the northern Brazil–Guyana border. Though the IUCN range map includes French Guiana, Suriname, and Paraguay, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society has no records in the first two countries and records only as a vagrant in Paraguay.

The Orinoco goose inhabits wet savanna and the edges of large freshwater wetlands in the wet season and in the dry season, it is also found on river beaches and oxbow lakes in the Amazon Basin.

==Behavior==
===Migration===

The Orinoco goose is a year-round resident of the Llanos of Venezuela and possibly Colombia. Some of the Bolivian population is also non-migratory. However, some leave the Llanos de Moxos to breed away in Manú National Park, Peru, and others move almost along the Río Juruá in western Brazil. The migration patterns of other populations, or lack theorof, are not known.

The migration of Orinoco geese may spread disease. &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and &quot;Neospora caninum&quot; are both apicomplexan parasites that infect various animals and cause severe disease. They thrive in fields where Orinoco geese forage during stopovers during migration. Once birds are infected, they can transmit the parasites to other birds or humans. Orinoco goose meat is eaten by people in Bolivia and Brazil, potentially leading to human infection.

===Feeding===

The Orinoco goose is herbivorous and feeds mainly on leaves and seed heads, especially those of grasses. It also feeds on aquatic algae in stagnant water along rivers and oxbows. It mostly forages during the day in open areas near water, although it also forages at night. Individuals move between feeding and resting areas at dawn and dusk.

===Breeding===

The Ornico goose&#x27;s breeding season varies geographically and with rainfall patterns. Populations below the Equator nest between April and November, a mostly dry season. In Venezuela most nest in the July to August wet season though some nest at other times. Orinoco geese nest in both natural and artificial cavities. They use cavities in trees formed by natural causes such as limb loss or rot rather than those created by other cavity-nesting species and may compete with owls and parrots for cavities. There are some reports of nesting on the ground in dense grass but that strategy appears rare. 

Orinoco geese are sometimes brood parasites, with a female laying eggs in another Orinoco goose&#x27;s nest. In one study, unparasitized nests had a clutch size averaging seven eggs while the parasitized ones averaged about 19. Nest success as a percentage of the clutch was higher in parasitized nests.

Orinoco geese form strong year-round pair bonds and are intensely territorial during the breeding season. Males guard females during the incubation period.
===Vocalization===

The Orinoco goose is very vocal. During the breeding season males make &quot;a high whistle and guttural honks&quot; and females &quot;a loud cackle&quot;. Males also make &quot;a shrill-whistled &quot;zree&quot; and series of hollow reedy whistles&quot; and females &quot;a low guttural honking &quot;gu&#x27;rump, gur&#x27;rump, gur&#x27;rump&quot;&quot;. Both sexes make &quot;a distinctive nasal honking, &quot;unnhh?&quot;&quot;. Young make &quot;soft chicken-like peeps&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the Orinoco goose as Near Threatened. It has a large range but its estimated population of 10,000 to 25,000 mature individuals is decreasing &quot;at a slow to moderate rate&quot;. The major cause of the decline appears to be hunting because populations on unhunted protected areas are stable. Ongoing conversion of habitat to rice cultivation is another threat. Conservation efforts should focus on river margins, sandy beaches along main river channels, and migration routes.

<text>The Treaty of Ripon was a truce between Charles I, King of England, and the Covenanters, a Scottish political movement, which brought a cessation of hostilities to the Second Bishops&#x27; War.

The Covenanter movement had arisen in opposition to attempts by Charles, who was also King of Scotland, to reform the Church of Scotland to bring it into closer alignment with the Church of England. In 1638, the Covenanters gained political supremacy in Scotland and the next year Charles mobilised to restore his authority over Scotland by force. A confrontation between Scots and English armies was avoided when a truce was negotiated in June 1639, ending what would later be known as the First Bishops&#x27; War. However, this did not resolve fundamental issues and the political struggle continued into the next year. To gain the funds for a second military action against the Scots, Charles called a new English parliament—the first in 11 years. When this assembled in April 1640, the parliament would not agree to supply funds for his renewed war effort unless he first addressed various long-standing grievances. Unwilling to do so, Charles dissolved what became known as the Short Parliament after only three weeks and again prepared for war using his own resources. 

In August 1640, a Scots Covenanter army invaded England, won a decisive victory at the Battle of Newburn and proceeded to occupy Northumberland, County Durham, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Charles assembled the Great Council of Peers to negotiate with the Scots. The two sides met in Ripon near York where the Scots agreed to a cessation of hostilities provided they were paid daily expenses indefinitely until a final settlement could be negotiated and ratified by a new English parliament.

Over the next year, further negotiations in London led eventually to a formal peace treaty ending the Bishops&#x27; Wars. Meanwhile, the Long Parliament, as it became known, was strongly opposed to the King and his government and passed a series of acts which meant Charles could no longer dissolve it at will. Antagonism between the King and the Parliament escalated to armed conflict in 1642: the start of the English Civil War.

==Background==
===National Covenant===
The Protestant Reformation created a Church of Scotland, or &#x27;kirk&#x27;, Presbyterian in structure, and Calvinist in doctrine. While &#x27;Presbyterian&#x27; and &#x27;Episcopalian&#x27; now implies differences in both governance and doctrine, this was not the case in the 17th century. Episcopalian structures were governed by bishops, usually appointed by the monarch, Presbyterian by presbyters, elected by ministers and elders. Arguments over the role of bishops were as much about politics and the power of the monarch as religious practice.

When James VI and I succeeded as king of England in 1603, he viewed a unified Church of Scotland and England as the first step in creating a centralised, Unionist state. This policy was adopted by his son, Charles I, but the two were very different in doctrine, while English Puritans also objected to proposed reforms to the Church of England. 

In 1636, a new Book of Canons replaced John Knox&#x27;s Book of Discipline and excommunicated anyone who denied the King&#x27;s supremacy in church matters. Charles failed to consult either the kirk or the Scottish Parliament, and these reforms caused outrage in Scotland. When followed in 1637 by a new Book of Common Prayer, it resulted in riots, and in February 1638, representatives from all sections of Scottish society agreed a National Covenant, pledging resistance to liturgical &#x27;innovations.&#x27; It tapped into widespread dissatisfaction with the policies advocated by a largely absentee monarch, and the loss of Scottish political influence to England. The Covenant was supported by most of the nobility, including the Marquess of Argyll and six other members of the Scottish Privy Council.

Although Charles agreed to defer discussion of the new canons to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, he made it clear he had no intention of making any concessions. When the Assembly gathered in Glasgow in December it rejected the changes, expelled bishops from the kirk, and affirmed its right to meet annually, not just when the king agreed. The Marquis of Hamilton advised Charles there was now no alternative to war. With the Scottish Parliament recruiting soldiers and seeking support from foreign governments and English Puritans, Charles decided to treat this as an act of rebellion and responded by gathering an army to march on Scotland.

===Bishops&#x27; Wars===

In March 1639 Covenanter forces seized Edinburgh and other Scottish towns, starting the First Bishops&#x27; War, which ended without a battle in June by the Treaty of Berwick. Following this, Charles called the Short Parliament in April 1640, seeking funds for a second campaign; when Parliament refused to approve taxes until he had agreed to address other issues, it was dissolved after only three weeks, ahead of a debate likely to result in a petition against the war in Scotland. Instead, Charles turned to the Parliament of Ireland for funds, and planned another invasion of Scotland supported by an army from Ireland, a naval blockade of the Forth, and an uprising in the Highlands.

The success of the Covenanters in asserting the rights of Parliament in Scotland emboldened Charles&#x27; English opponents, led by John Pym, who began secret talks with the Scots. Seeking to limit royal authority in England, this group represented a much broader body of dissenters who had been alienated by Charles&#x27; policies during his over a decade-long period of Personal Rule. With this invitation, and warned about the king&#x27;s plans by allies from within the English parliament, the Covenanters launched an invasion of England, bypassing the heavily defended city of Berwick, starting the Second Bishops’ War. At the Battle of Newburn, 28 August 1640, the English army was routed by Scottish forces who then captured Newcastle two days later before continuing their advance south, occupying Durham and establishing an advanced line on the River Tees on 18 September.

==Negotiations==
With Newcastle, along with most of Northumberland and Durham, under the control of the Covenanters, Charles called a meeting of the Great Council of Peers in York, the first time this body had met for a century. The Council declined to assume the functions of Parliament, but did negotiate the treaty with the Covenanters.

Meanwhile, the Scottish army was facing shortages of supply and started collecting moneys from the nearby shires and church properties, as well as from Newcastle itself in order to pay for the continued upkeep of the army. This shortage of supplies did confer a negotiating advantage to the Covenanters though. With incidents of pillaging by soldiers already being reported, the English lords did not want to see the army become a mob living in the area of Newcastle, but Charles could not afford to pay the invaders&#x27; demands without the tax-raising powers of Parliament, making a settlement involving both king and Parliament inevitable. In collaboration with the king&#x27;s opponents the Covenanters also refused to withdraw until Charles summoned the English Parliament.

==Terms==

Under the terms of the treaty the Scots continued to occupy Northumberland and Durham, and were to receive expenses of £850 a day starting from 16 October paid from England, but agreed to a temporary cessation of hostilities. This situation was to continue until a full settlement was agreed. The Scottish Government was also to be reimbursed for its expenses in the war.

Though humiliating for Charles, he was desperate to stop the Covenanters from taking York and, with little support from his peers, his options were limited, and he was compelled to agree terms.

Terms were finalised on 16 October, and accepted by Charles on the 28th. Negotiations on the permanent settlement would continue for another 10 months until August 1641, when the Treaty of London was signed.

==Aftermath==
Charles issued writs for what became known as the Long Parliament, which assembled on 3 November 1640. Since the Scots made it clear they would only return home once paid, and would only agree terms with Parliament, Charles was now faced with a body that he could not dissolve at will. During this time the Covenanters used their army&#x27;s continued presence in England to strengthen the position of the king&#x27;s English opponents.

Over the next few months, Parliament voted to ensure it could not be dissolved without its own consent, imprisoned Archbishop Laud, and executed the Earl of Strafford. Only then did it agree the Treaty of London on 10 August 1641, which agreed to pay the Scots £300,000 to cover the costs of the war. The Covenanters&#x27; army then returned to Scotland, where most of it was disbanded.

Disputes between Charles and Parliament continued to escalate, culminating in the attempted arrest of the Five Members in January 1642. Charles left London and began rallying support for his cause; the First English Civil War began on 22 August 1642.
