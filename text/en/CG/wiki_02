== Career ==
=== 1967–1986: Early theatre work ===

Eyre was Associate Director at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh from 1967 to 1972. He won STV Awards for the Best Production in Scotland in 1969, 1970 and 1971. His productions at the Lyceum included Jack Ronder&#x27;s adaptation of James Hogg&#x27;s novel, &quot;Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; in August 1971. He was artistic director of Nottingham Playhouse from 1973–78 where he commissioned and directed many new plays, including the Trevor Griffiths play &quot;Comedians&quot; starring Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Rea, and Tom Wilkinson which was first performed in 1975.

Eyre worked as both a director and one of the producers of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; between 1978 and 1980. He directed &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Lunch&quot; (written by Ian McEwan) in 1983, which won the Evening Standard Award for Best Film. He returned to the BBC in 1988 to direct the Falklands War story &quot;Tumbledown&quot; (starring Colin Firth), which won him the BAFTA Award for Best Director and the Prix Italia. He has been the recipient of numerous directing awards including five Olivier Awards. In 1982 he won the Evening Standard Award for Best Director, for &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and in 1997 for &quot;King Lear&quot; and Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Invention of Love&quot;. In 1997 he won an Olivier Lifetime Achievement Award, and awards from The Directors&#x27; Guild of Great Britain, the South Bank Show, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and the Critics&#x27; Circle.

=== 1987–1999: Royal National Theatre ===

Eyre was artistic director of the UK&#x27;s National Theatre (which gained the now little-used prefix Royal as outgoing director Peter Hall handed over to him) between 1987 and 1997. He had previously directed a well received revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; for the venue in 1982, with Olivier Award-winner Julia McKenzie and Bob Hoskins. He repeated this production in 1996 with Imelda Staunton and Joanna Riding. His diaries from his time at the National have been published as &quot;National Service&quot;, winning the 2003 Theatre Book Prize.

Other than &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, his theatre productions include &quot;Hamlet&quot; (twice), with Jonathan Pryce at the Royal Court in 1980 and Daniel Day-Lewis in 1989; &quot;Richard III&quot; with Ian McKellen; &quot;King Lear&quot; with Ian Holm; Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; and &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;; Eduardo De Filippo&#x27;s &quot;Napoli Milionaria&quot; and &quot;Le Grande Magia&quot;; Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; with Paul Scofield, Vanessa Redgrave and Eileen Atkins; Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; with Eve Best; and numerous new plays by David Hare, Tom Stoppard, Trevor Griffiths, Howard Brenton, Alan Bennett, Christopher Hampton and Nicholas Wright. He made his Broadway debut directing the David Hare play &quot;Racing Demon&quot; earning a Tony Award for Best Play nomination. The following year he directed the Broadway transfer of Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Skylight&quot; (1996). He directed Hare&#x27;s play &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot; (1998) starring Liam Neeson and Tom Hollander on the West End and Broadway. The next year he directed Judi Dench in Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot; at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway which earned her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. 

Eyre has also directed operas. His debut was the 1994 production of &quot;La traviata&quot; at the Royal Opera House which starred Angela Gheorghiu and was conducted by Sir Georg Solti. This production was televised and has subsequently been released on video and DVD. Eyre was appointed to the Board of Governors of the BBC in November 1995, and in October 2000 was appointed for a second term of office, though he resigned early (with effect from 31 May 2003) due to theatre and film directing commitments. Eyre has written adaptations of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and of Sartre&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dirty Hands&quot;) as &quot;The Novice&quot; for the Almeida Theatre. A friend of Ian Charleson, whom he directed in acclaimed performances of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Eyre contributed a chapter to the 1990 book, &quot;For Ian Charleson: A Tribute&quot;.

=== 2000–2009: Film director ===

In 2001 he directed the biographical drama &quot;Iris&quot; about writer and philosopher Iris Murdoch. The film covers her early life to her later years dealing with Alzheimers. Critics praised the film specifically citing the powerful performances from its four stars Judi Dench, Jim Broadbent, Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville. Broadbent won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Iris&quot;, and Dench and Winslet were nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. The following year he directed the Broadway revival of the Arthur Miller play &quot;The Crucible&quot; starring Liam Neeson and Laura Linney. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Eyre’s production has an earnest integrity to the text that firmly accentuates the play’s powerful aspects&quot;.

In 2006, he directed &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot;, the film adaptation of the Man Booker Prize-nominated novel by Zoë Heller. The film starred Judi Dench, Cate Blanchett, and Bill Nighy. James Christopher of &quot;The Times&quot; praised the film writing, &quot;Eyre directs the film like a chamber play...his natural gift for framing scenes is terrifically assured. A potent and evil pleasure.&quot; The film was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film as well as two Academy Awards for Best Actress for Dench and Best Supporting Actress for Blanchett. He then directed the 2005 stage musical &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; for West End and Broadway. For his work on the former production he received a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director nomination. On 14 February 2007, Eyre&#x27;s production of Nicholas Wright&#x27;s &quot;The Reporter&quot; premiered at the National Theatre, London. The play explores the social climate in the years before James Mossman&#x27;s death as well as the reasons for the death itself. He directed &quot;The Other Man&quot; (2008), an adaptation of a short story by Bernhard Schlink, starring Liam Neeson, Antonio Banderas, and Laura Linney.

Eyre directed a new production of Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; for the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 2009–10 season, starring Latvian mezzo-soprano Elīna Garanča and Roberto Alagna. He returned to the Met for the 2013–14 season where he created and directed a new production of Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; with Jonas Kaufmann and Sophie Koch and returned to create and direct the 2014–15 season opening production, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. Eyre was planning to direct Jon Robin Baitz&#x27;s stage adaptation of Hollywood legend Robert Evans&#x27; memoirs &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Fat Lady Sang&quot;, but the project was cancelled by the producer.

=== 2010–present ===
His production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; starring Kim Cattrall and Paul Gross opened at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway in November 2011 following a run in Toronto. He directed &quot;The Dark Earth&quot; and &quot;The Light Sky&quot; for the Almeida Theatre, and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; for the Chichester Festival Theatre. In 2012, he directed &quot;Henry IV, Part I and Part II&quot; as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; series. In November 2013, he once again won the Evening Standard Award for Best Director for Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot; at the Almeida Theatre. This production moved to the West End.

In the late 2010s, Eyre directed numerous projects for the screen. In 2015 he directed the television film &quot;The Dresser&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins and Ian McKellen based on the 1980 play of the same name by Ronald Harwood. It received positive reviews as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film nomination. He also directed the drama film &quot;The Children Act&quot; (2017), based on the novel of the same name by Ian McEwan and starring Emma Thompson. The following year he directed the BBC Two television film &quot;King Lear&quot; (2018) which starred Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Florence Pugh, and Jim Broadbent. It earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. 

In 2021, Eyre directed &quot;Allelujah&quot;, a film adaptation of Alan Bennett&#x27;s play of the same name which starred Jennifer Saunders, Bally Gill, Russell Tovey, David Bradley, Derek Jacobi, and Judi Dench. His play &#x27;The Snail House&#x27; was premiered at Hampstead Theatre in 2022.

<text>Coco López (English: &quot;Coconut López&quot;) is a Puerto Rican producer of a brand of coconut products sold internationally. It is most well-known for its use in the piña colada cocktail, which was first invented in Puerto Rico using &quot;Coco López&quot; coconut cream.

&quot;Coco López&quot; was invented by Ramón López Irizarry, a World War I veteran who was an agricultural professor for the University of Puerto Rico. López left the university and commercialized his product, which eventually found its way into the supermarkets of the island. Its most popular product, &quot;Cream of Coconut&quot;, is made of coconut cream with the addition of sugar as a sweetener, xanthan gum as a stabilizer, and citric acid as a flavoring and preservative agent.

<doc id="973686" wikidata="Q21483302" url="?curid=973686" title="Amami Ōshima language">
<text>The Amami language or languages (, , ), also known as Amami Ōshima or simply Ōshima (&#x27;Big Island&#x27;), is a Ryukyuan language spoken in the Amami Islands south of Kyūshū. The southern variety of the Setouchi township may be a distinct language more closely related to Okinawan than it is to northern Ōshima.

As Amami does not have recognition within Japan as a language, it is officially known as the .

==Speakers==
The number of competent native speakers is not known, but native speakers are found mostly among old people—as a result of Japan&#x27;s language policy which suppresses proliferation of minority languages, the younger generations speak mostly Japanese as their first language. Estimates run around 10,000 for the northern variety and 2,000 for the southern (Setouchi) variety.

==Classification==
Linguists mostly agree on the validity of the Amami–Okinawan languages as a family. The subdivisions of Amami–Okinawan, however, remain a matter of scholarly debate, with two major hypotheses:
*In a two-branch hypothesis, posited by Nakasone (1961), Hirayama (1964) and Nakamoto (1990), among others, Amami–Okinawan divides into &quot;Amami&quot; and &quot;Okinawan&quot;, with the northern and southern varieties of Amami Ōshima both falling within the Amami branch. 
*In a three-subdivision hypothesis, proposed by Uemura (1972) as one of several possible classifications and supported by Karimata (2000), Northern Amami Ōshima (perhaps together with Kikai) and Central/Southern Okinawa form two branches, while the intervening varieties – Southern Amami Ōshima (Setouchi), Kunigami, and the dialects/languages of the islands between – form a third branch. In this proposal, Amami Ōshima does not constitute a single language, and the northern and southern varieties are not even more closely related to each other than they are to other Ryukyuan languages.

The two-subdivision hypothesis is convenient for discussing the modern languages since the posited linguistic boundary corresponds to the centuries-old administrative boundary that today separates Kagoshima and Okinawa Prefectures. In addition, several isoglosses do group Northern and Southern Amami together. In Amami, word-medial is changed to or even dropped when it is surrounded by , or . This can rarely be observed in Okinawan dialects. Standard Japanese becomes in Amami and in Okinawan.

The three-subdivision hypothesis is more phylogenetically-oriented. A marked isogloss is the vowel systems. Standard Japanese corresponds to in Northern Amami Ōshima while it was merged into in Southern Amami Ōshima through Okinawan.

The vowel system-based classification is not without complication. The northern three communities of Kikai Island share the seven-vowel system with Amami Ōshima and Tokunoshima to the south, while the rest of Kikai falls in with Okinoerabu and Yoron even further south.
Based on other evidence, however, Karimata (2000) and Lawrence (2011) tentatively group Kikai dialects together.

==Dialects==
Amami Ōshima can be divided into Northern Amami Ōshima and Southern Amami Ōshima despite conflicting patterns of isoglosses.
The distribution of Southern Amami Ōshima roughly corresponds to Setouchi Town, including offshore islands. The rest of the main island speaks Northern Amami Ōshima.

Shibata et al. (1984) takes a lexicostatistic approach to subgrouping Northern Amami Ōshima dialects:
*East China Sea side
**Akatana
**Yamato Village
**Uken Village
*Pacific Ocean side
**Komi (Kominato)
**Northern Sumiyō
**Southern Sumiyō
In addition, Sani, a small community on a peninsula at the northern tip of the island, is known to have distinct phonology.

Based on phonetic and lexical evidence, Shibata et al. (1984) subdivide Southern Amami Ōshima into
*Higashi (Eastern) Magiri
*Nishi (Western) Magiri
reflecting the administrative divisions during the Edo period. While Uke Island belonged to the Nishi Magiri district, its dialect is closer to that of Higashi Magiri.

Southern Amami Ōshima contrasts with Northern Amami Ōshima in its final unreleased consonants. For example, &quot;shrimp&quot; is in Ōshama (Southern) and in Tatsugō (Northern); &quot;blade&quot; is in Ōshama and in Tatsugō.

==Names==
According to Osada Suma (1902–1998), the dialect of Yamatohama, Yamato Village of Amami Ōshima had for &#x27;language&#x27;, for &#x27;island language&#x27; (i.e. Amami Ōshima) and for the language of mainland Japan (i.e. Standard Japanese). Another term, &quot;shimaguchi&quot; , is absent from Osada&#x27;s dictionary. According to Kurai Norio (b. 1923), a local historian from Amami Ōshima, &quot;shimaguchi&quot; contrasted with &quot;Yamatoguchi&quot;, while &quot;shimayumuta&quot; was associated with accentual and intonational differences among various &quot;shima&quot; (villages). Ebara Yoshimori (1905–1988), a folklorist from Naze, Amami Ōshima, conjectured that &quot;shimaguchi&quot; was of relatively recent origin, possibly made through analogy with &quot;Yamatoguchi&quot;. He thought that the dialect of one&#x27;s home community was better referred to as .

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Historically, vowel-initial words acquired an epenthetic glottal stop. When *wo and *we later became and without an initial glottal stop, the glottal stop elsewhere became phonemic. When still later initial vowels were elided, an initial glottal stop merged with the following consonant, establishing a series of &quot;glottalized&quot; consonants. While the nasals are truly glottalized, the &quot;glottalized&quot; stops are merely tenuis , contrasting with the default aspirated stops .

: (Naze dialect)
: (Koniya dialect


====Closed syllables====
In the southern Shodon dialect, the consonants occur at the end of a word or syllable, as in &#x27;neck&#x27;, &#x27;cherry blossom&#x27; and &#x27;well&#x27;. 
Other dialects are similar. Final consonants are usually the result of eliding high front vowels. Elision is partly conditioned by pitch accent. In Shodon dialect, for example, the noun with accent classes 2.1 and 2.2 are realized as (water, 2.1) and (stone, 2.2) while 2.3-5 nouns retain final vowels, e.g. (ear, 2.3), (needle, 2.4) and (spring, 2.5).

=== Vowels ===
There are seven distinct vowel qualities in Amami Ōshima, in addition to a phonemic distinction between long and short vowels and in some dialects oral and nasal vowels.

 and are generally transcribed &quot;ï&quot; and &quot;ë&quot; in the literature.

 derives from *e and merges with after alveolar consonants. mostly derives from a merger of *ae and *ai, and so is usually long. In several northern dialects, the nasal vowels developed from the loss of a word-medial :
: *pama &gt; &#x27;shore&#x27;, *jome &gt; &#x27;bride&#x27;, *kimo &gt; &#x27;liver&#x27;, *ɕima &gt; &#x27;island&#x27;, *mimidzu &gt; &#x27;earthworm&#x27;

Kasarisani dialect has 11 oral and nasal vowels, while Sani dialect adds long vowels for a total of 18, the largest inventory of any Ryukyuan dialect.

<doc id="973698" wikidata="Q1334480" url="?curid=973698" title="European Social Charter">
<text>The European Social Charter is a Council of Europe treaty which was opened for signature on 18 October 1961 and initially became effective on 26 February 1965, after West Germany had become the fifth of the 13 signing nations to ratify it. By 1991, 20 nations had ratified it.

==Contents==
The Charter was established to support the European Convention on Human Rights which is principally for civil and political rights, and to broaden the scope of protected fundamental rights to include social and economic rights. The Charter also guarantees positive rights and freedoms which concern all individuals in their daily existence. 
The basic rights set out in the Charter are as follows: housing, health, education, labour rights, full employment, reduction of working hours equal pay for equal work, parental leave, social security, social and legal protection from poverty and social exclusion, free movement of persons and non-discrimination, also the rights of migrant workers and that of the persons with disabilities.

States Parties to the Charter must submit annual reports on a part of the provisions of the Charter (be it the 1961 Charter or the 1996 Revised Charter), showing how they implement them in law and in practice.

==1996 revision==
The Charter was revised in 1996. The Revised Charter came into force in 1999 and is gradually replacing the initial 1961 treaty. The Charter sets out human rights and freedoms and establishes a supervisory mechanism guaranteeing their respect by the States parties.

Article 21 creates the right to information and consultation.

Article 22 creates the &quot;right to take part in the determination and improvement of the working conditions and working environment&quot;, or codetermination through representation on company or enterprise board of directors and work councils.

==European Committee of Social Rights==
The European Committee of Social Rights (ECSR) is the body responsible for monitoring compliance in the States party to the Charter.

The ECSR is composed of 15 independent members who are elected by the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee of Ministers for a period of six years, renewable once.

Under the 1995 Additional Protocol providing for a system of Collective Complaints which came into force in 1998, complaints of violations of the Charter may be lodged with the ECSR.

Certain organisations are entitled to lodge complaints with the ECSR (a special list of NGOs has been established, made up of NGOs enjoying participatory status with the Council of Europe). The ECSR examines the complaint and, if the formal requirements have been met, declares it admissible. The State Party may then respond in writing, and a hearing may be requested by either party to the procedure. Finally, the Committee comes to a decision on the merits.

<doc id="973699" wikidata="Q808992" url="?curid=973699" title="Barrowland Ballroom">
<text>The Barrowland Ballroom (also known as Barrowland and The Barras) is an entertainment venue, dance hall and music venue located in the Calton district in Glasgow, Scotland.

A prominent feature of the music scene in Glasgow, the venue has appeared in various elements of popular culture, notably tracks by Amy Macdonald and Simple Minds. 

== History ==

The original building opened in 1934 in a mercantile area east of Glasgow&#x27;s city centre, built by Maggie McIver, the &quot;Barras Queen&quot;. The area and the ballroom are named after the Glasgow Barrowland market. 

The building was completely rebuilt after being largely destroyed by fire in 1958, and reopened on 24 December 1960. The Barrowland building includes large street-level halls used for the weekend markets, with a large weatherproof hall above. The front of the building is decorated with a large animated neon sign.

Since 2020, Barrowland Ballroom has been the venue for the annual Scottish Music Awards. 

== Uses and rooms ==

From 1983 onwards the ballroom became a concert venue with a capacity of 1,900 standing, known for its acoustics and its sprung dance floor. Simple Minds relaunched the venue by filming the video for their 1983 single, &quot;Waterfront&quot;, at Barrowlands. Adjacent to the ballroom itself is the Barrowland Park, where there is a path displaying the names of many artists who have played at the venue. Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers have played sold-out concerts at the venue every St Patrick&#x27;s Day since 1992, and recorded their &quot;Best Served Loud&quot; album there in 2016 to celebrate 25 years at Barrowland.

The Barrowland 2 is part of the Barrowland Ballroom and is used both as a bar when larger shows are playing in the main hall and as a venue to host smaller gigs. While it occasionally plays host to smaller or acoustic gigs from more established acts, its usual function is as a venue for small local Glasgow bands. The promoters also host an event showcasing unsigned local acts in the main ballroom every year.

== Bible John ==
Between 1968 and 1969, three young women (Patricia Docker, Jemima MacDonald and Helen Puttock) were found brutally murdered after nights out at the Barrowland. All three murders were attributed to a man dubbed &quot;Bible John&quot; by police after he was heard referring to the Old Testament to one of his victims. Similarities between the murders led police to believe that they were the work of the same man. The man made contact with all three women at the Barrowland Ballroom, before escorting them home and raping and strangling them within yards of their doorsteps. All three women were menstruating and their handbags were stolen. An investigation failed to find Bible John, and the murders remain unsolved. On the night of the murder of Helen Puttock, Puttock&#x27;s sister Jeannie Langford was with her and spoke to her sister&#x27;s suspected killer. Jeannie described Bible John as: &quot;25–35 years old, reddish/fair hair, wore a blue suit and matching trousers with white shirt. Spoke very politely and was very religious&quot;. In 2007, following the murder of Angelica Kluk, speculation arose that serial killer Peter Tobin was Bible John, due to similarities in &quot;modus operandi&quot;. Tobin frequented the Barrowland, and moved to Brighton in late 1968 before the last two murders were committed.

== Cultural impact ==

The Barrowland features heavily in the 2015 movie &quot;The Legend of Barney Thomson&quot;, directed by Robert Carlyle. It features in part of the opening scene of the 2014 movie &quot;God Help the Girl&quot; from writer/director Stuart Murdoch (lead singer of indie pop group Belle &amp; Sebastian)

Scottish singer Amy Macdonald has a song about the ballroom, titled &quot;Barrowland Ballroom&quot; on her 2007 album &quot;This Is The Life&quot;. The edifice appears in a number of scenes in &quot;The Field of Blood (TV series)&quot;, a British crime drama television series. The Barrowland is where young girls are picked up before being murdered in the novel &quot;The Quaker&quot; by Liam McIlvanney.

Simple Minds named a track after the venue on their 2018 studio album, &quot;Walk Between Worlds&quot;. Track 6 on the album was named &quot;Barrowland Star&quot; due to their close affinity with the venue. It features in &quot;Fearful Lightning&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;Taggart&quot;. 

In April 2021, a mural inspired by Douglas Stuart&#x27;s Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Shuggie Bain&quot; was unveiled on the wall of the Barrowland Ballroom, featuring a boy dancing in the street, together with a quote from the book: &quot;You&#x27;ll not remember the city, you were too wee, but there&#x27;s dancing. All kinds of dancing.&quot; The artwork and lettering was created by the Cobolt Collective – comprising Glasgow School of Art 2015 graduates Erin Bradley-Scott, Chelsea Frew and Kat Loudon – and is .

<text>Tynemouth Priory and Castle is a historic site located on a promontory at the mouth of the Tyne at Tynemouth. The medieval Benedictine priory was protected by walls, towers, and a gatehouse. The heraldry of the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside includes three crowns commemorating the three kings who have been buried in the priory. 
==Tynemouth Priory==
=== Early history ===
The earliest evidence for human habitation on the promontory are the trace remains of two circular wooden houses, the larger being typical of the Votadini tribe of the late Iron Age two centuries before the Roman invasion of AD 43 and the smaller being of the Roman period in the 2nd century.

The monastery was probably founded by one of the Anglian kings of Northumbria. Medieval traditions assert that it was founded in the mid 7th century when the Deiran king St Oswine, the first king to be buried at Tynemouth, was interred at the site by his murderer Oswiu, a Bernician king, who established the convent in penance. An abbey at the site is mentioned by Bede and by 792 it was of enough significance to be the burial place of the Northumbrian king Osred II, the second king to be buried at Tynemouth. The monastery was a target for Viking raids throughout the 9th century until its destruction in 875. No building survives from this period of the site&#x27;s history but several fragments of Anglo-Saxon crosses have been found as well as trace remains of five rectangular wooden buildings.

A towered parish church dedicated to St Mary is recorded as having stood at the site in the mid 11th century by a chaplain of Tostig, Earl of Northumbria. The church was destroyed by William the Conqueror during the Harrying of the North.

In 1065 a corpse was exhumed at the ruined monastery thought to be that of St Oswine and in 1083 the monastery was refounded by a monk of the Benedictine Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey, which was a daughter cell of Durham Priory, named Turchil. However, in 1090 Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria, granted his lands in and around Tynemouth to St Albans Abbey leading to a longstanding dispute of jurisdiction between the monks of Durham and St Albans. Shortly after the grant construction began on the new church which was dedicated to St Oswine, whose shrine became a place of pilgrimage, and the Virgin Mary.

In 1093 Malcolm III, King of Scotland, was killed at the Battle of Alnwick and became the third king to be buried at Tynemouth. Alexander I later arranged for his father&#x27;s body to be reburied at Dunfermline Abbey.

On 20 August 1110 the shrine of St Oswine was ceremoniously transferred to the new church at Tynemouth from Jarrow marking the completion of its east end, while work on the nave continued. There was a fire in 1150 which destroyed the thatched dormitory, refectory, and guesthouse.

=== Height of power ===

The dispute between the monks of Durham and St Albans was resolved in 1174 with Tynemouth Priory remaining a daughter cell of St Albans Abbey. It was at this time that the priory received rights, privileges, and extensive lands which were confirmed by Richard I in 1189. The vast monastic estate became known as the Liberty of Tynemouth from which the prior and convent profited from rents, produce, and coal. This newfound wealth led to a period of renovation and construction from 1190 to 1260. The choir and presbytery were completely rebuilt, the shrine of St Oswine was gilded by Baldwin, a goldsmith from St Albans, the nave was extended and given a new west front, windows in the refectory were repaired, and the chapter house was remodelled.

In the early 13th century the prior developed North Shields to serve as the priory&#x27;s port on the Tyne which caused tension with the burgesses of Newcastle who had previously held a monopoly on all coal, wool, and fish being transported and sold along the river. The mayor of Newcastle led a group of armed men and burnt the nascent fishing village to the ground in 1270. The priory was seeking independence from St Albans and so the abbot, together with the mayor and burgesses of Newcastle, convinced Edward I to suspend Tynemouth&#x27;s trade and revoke the Liberty in 1290. However, due to the fortifications erected during the invasion of Scotland in 1296, Edward I and Margaret of France visited the priory regularly and had a private oratory built for their use. As thanks for the hospitality of the monks the Liberty was restored and trade allowed to continue.

Adam FitzRoy, an illegitimate son of Edward II, died on 18 September 1322 whilst accompanying his father to Scotland and was buried at Tynemouth on 30 September 1322.

From the 13th century onwards it was common for St Albans to send recalcitrant monks to Tynemouth as punishment. One such monk wrote a letter in the mid 14th century giving the first known written description of the priory: Our house is confined to the top of a high rock and is surrounded by sea on every side but one. Here is the approach to the monastery through a gate cut out of the rock so narrow that a cart can hardly pass through. Day and night the waves break and roar and undermine the cliff. Thick sea frets roll in wrapping everything in a gloom. Dim eyes, hoarse voices, sore throats are the consequence... Shipwrecks are frequent. It is a great pity to see the numbed crew, whom no power on earth can save, whose vessel, mast swaying and timbers parted, rushes upon the rock or reef. No ringdove or nightingale is here, only grey birds which nest in rocks and greedily prey upon the drowned, whose screaming cry is a token of a coming storm... In the Spring the sea air blights the blossoms of the stunted fruit trees, so that you are lucky to find a wizened apple, though it will set your teeth on edge if you try to eat it. See to it, dear brother, that you do not come to this comfortless place. But the church is of wondrous beauty. It has been lately completed. Within it rests the body of the blessed martyr, Oswine, in a silver shrine, magnificently decorated with gold and jewels. He protects the murderers, thieves and seditious persons who fly to him and commutes their punishment to exile. He heals those whom no doctor can cure. The martyr&#x27;s protection and the church&#x27;s beauty furnish us with a bond of unity. We are well off for food, thanks to the abundant supply of fish of which we tire.The church housing the shrine mentioned here refers to the Lady chapel which was built before 1336. The Percy chapel was added in the mid 15th century.

=== Dissolution of the monasteries ===

In the early 16th century Tynemouth finally gained independence from St Albans, granted by Thomas Wolsey. However, shortly after in January 1539 the priory was suppressed by Henry VIII who took possession of all of the monastic lands and destroyed the shrine of St Oswine, bringing the priory to an end.

=== List of priors ===
==Tynemouth Castle==
In 1095 Robert de Mowbray revolted against William II. When the Earl&#x27;s stronghold, Bamburgh Castle, was besieged by the king he and 30 followers took refuge in Tynemouth where they held out for six days before being captured, suggesting the monastery was defended in some way, perhaps by a motte-and-bailey castle.

When Edward I invaded Scotland in 1296 the prior received royal licence to crenellate the monastery. Curtain walls were erected atop an earth embankment which spans the neck of the promontory and may date back to the Norman defences or the late Iron Age settlement. The walls once encircled the entire monastery and were further fortified by Whitley Tower overlooking King Edward&#x27;s Bay and East Mount Tower towards Prior&#x27;s Haven. The stone walls were an extension of the monastery&#x27;s defences which had already existed as early as the reign of Henry II.

In 1312 Edward II took refuge in Tynemouth Castle together with his unpopular favourite Piers Gaveston, before fleeing by sea to Scarborough Castle despite the pleas of his wife, Isabella.

After his victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 Robert the Bruce attacked Tynemouth but the castle was successfully defended by a garrison of 80 men-at-arms. In 1318 the king appointed a custodian of priory fortifications. In February 1390 Richard II, John of Gaunt, and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, all paid large sums of money towards Tynemouth&#x27;s defences and soon construction of a gatehouse began in the middle of the aforementioned embankment which was complete by the early 15th century.

The castle remained in royal hands following the suppression of the priory due to its strategic importance. New artillery fortifications were built from 1545 onwards, with the advice of Sir Richard Lee and the Italian military engineers Gian Tommaso Scala and Antonio da Bergamo. The medieval castle walls were updated with new gunports. The castle was the birthplace of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland in 1564, during the period when his father, the 8th Earl, was guardian of the castle.

In May 1594 George Selby and Thomas Power, lieutenant of Tynemouth Castle, captured two fugitives from the court of Anne of Denmark who had stolen some of her jewels. Power kept Jacob Kroger, a German goldsmith, and Guillaume Martyn, a French stableman, as prisoners at Tynemouth for five weeks until they were returned to Edinburgh for summary trial and execution.

William Selby became keeper of Tynemouth Castle in December 1606, succeeding Sir Henry Widdrington. An inventory was made of the artillery at the castle. Some muskets and halberds in the great chamber and armoury were claimed for the Earl of Northumberland. Selby wrote that the house or lodging was uninhabitable and the guns were not mounted. His duties involved keeping a light for shipping.

==Subsequent history==
===Lighthouse===

For some time a navigation light, in the form of a coal-fired brazier, had been maintained on top of one of the turrets at the east end of the Priory church. It is not known when this practice began, but a source of 1582 refers to: &quot;the kepinge of a continuall light in the night season at the easte ende of the churche of Tinmouthe castle ... for the more safegarde of such shippes as should passe by that coast&quot;. As Governor of Tynemouth Castle, Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland is recorded as having responsibility for the light&#x27;s maintenance; and he and his successors in that office were entitled to receive dues from passing ships in return.

In 1559, however, the stairs leading to the top of the turret collapsed, preventing the fire from being lit. In 1665, therefore, the then Governor (Colonel Villiers) had a purpose-built lighthouse erected on the headland (within the castle walls, using stone taken from the priory); it was rebuilt in 1775. Like its predecessor, the lighthouse was initially coal-fired, but in 1802 an oil-fired argand light was installed. In 1841 William Fowke (a descendant of Villiers and his successor as Governor) sold the lighthouse to Trinity House, London. On the establishment of a lighthouse at Souter Point in 1871, the Tynemouth light was altered to display a revolving red light (rather than revolving white). It remained in operation until 1898, when it was replaced by St. Mary&#x27;s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay to the north; Tynemouth Castle Lighthouse was then demolished.

===Coastal defence and coastguard station===

At the end of the 19th century the castle was used as a barracks with several new buildings being added.

In 1930 the castle was taken over by the Office of Works following a fire and many of the modern additions were removed. The castle played an important role during World War II when it was used as a coastal defence installation covering the mouth of the river Tyne. It also suffered heavy air raids in 1941. Military structures remained in place until 1956 when the army departed. The restored sections of the coastal defence emplacements are open to the public. These include a guardroom and the main armoury, where visitors can see how munitions were safely handled and protected.

More recently the site has hosted the modern buildings of Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard; however the new coastguard station, built in 1980 and opened by Prince Charles, was closed in 2001.

===Present day===
The gatehouse is the only building of the medieval defences to have survived intact. The surviving sections of the priory, including the east end wall and lancet windows, are examples of early Gothic architecture. The later Percy chapel remains completely intact. Much remains of the walls which are 3200 feet (975 m) in length. The promontory was originally completely enclosed by a curtain wall and towers, but the north and east walls fell into the sea, and most of the south wall was demolished; the west wall and a section of the south wall (with original wall walk) remain in good condition. Of the modern military structures only the Warrant Officer&#x27;s house and gun emplacements remain.

Tynemouth Castle and Priory is now managed by English Heritage, which charges an admission fee.

<doc id="973701" wikidata="Q4841567" url="?curid=973701" title="Baggage reclaim">
<text>In airport terminals, a baggage reclaim area is an area where arriving passengers claim checked-in baggage after disembarking from an airline flight. The alternative term baggage claim is used at airports in the US and some other airports internationally. Similar systems are also used at train stations served by companies that offer checked bags, such as Amtrak in the United States.

==Overview==
A typical baggage claim area contains baggage carousels or conveyor systems that deliver checked baggage to the passenger. The baggage claim area generally contains the airline&#x27;s customer service counter for claiming oversized baggage or reporting missing or damaged baggage.

Some airports require that passengers display their baggage receipt obtained at check-in so that it can be positively matched against the bag they are trying to remove from baggage reclaim. Many airports still recommend the baggage receipt is checked against the bag tag of the bag reclaimed. This serves two purposes: first, it reduces baggage theft, and second, it helps to prevent passengers from accidentally leaving the airport with another passenger&#x27;s bag that bears resemblance to their own.

For international arrivals, the baggage reclaim area is a restricted area, after passport and visa control and before clearing customs, so that all baggage can be inspected by customs agents, but the passenger does not have to handle heavy baggage while moving through the passport booth. In the United States and Canada, and also in some airports in Asia, all arriving international passengers&#x27; baggage is reclaimed here and can be re-checked by the airline for connecting flights on the other side of customs (for connection from international to domestic flights in most countries, all passengers must reclaim their baggage). In most other countries passengers transferring to an onward flight do not need to collect their bags unless their airline does not offer to through-check their bags to their final destination. This is required in American and some Canadian airports because international terminals are not enclosed (the only exit is through customs) and often serve domestic flights. The same rule applies in the case of airports that have U.S. border preclearance facilities. This means that passengers continuing onto the U.S. from other cities must retrieve their checked baggage first, then re-check them in after clearing U.S. Customs.

Depending on the airport, the domestic baggage reclaims area may be located next to or shared with the international reclaim area, or sometimes located in the public part of the airport alongside car rental desks and airport exits, and only passengers at their final destination claim their bags here. In most large airports in the United States and in some small ones as well, the domestic baggage reclaims are located on a different floor than the ticket counter, usually lower.

==Efficiency of baggage reclaim units==
The efficiency of baggage reclaim units can be measured in a number of ways including the amount of time a unit is in use for a given flight or the amount of baggage a unit can hold. A number of factors can independently affect the efficiency of a particular unit:
*Aircraft seating capacity
*Proportion of passengers with checked luggage
*Proportion of passengers who are terminating at a given destination
*Average number of luggage pieces per passenger
*Average traveling party size
*Average number of people at baggage reclaim
*Average rate at which luggage are unloaded from the flight (this also depends on the physical properties of checked luggage)

<text>John Berkenhout (8 July 1726 – 3 April 1791) was an English physician, naturalist and miscellaneous writer. He was educated as a physician at Edinburgh and Leyden. While at Edinburgh he published a botanical lexicon &quot;Clavis Anglicae Linguae Botanicae&quot;. He published several works on natural history, including &quot;Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1769) and &quot;Synopsis of the Natural History of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (1789). He served as a British agent in the colonies during the American Revolution.

==Life==
Berkenhout was born about 1730 at Leeds, the son of John Berkenhout Snr, a Dutch merchant who had settled in Yorkshire, and Anne Kitchingman. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School. His father intended him for a commercial career, and sent him to Germany to study languages. After spending some years in Germany he accompanied some English noblemen on a tour through Europe. On returning to Berlin he stayed with his father&#x27;s relative Baron von Bielfeld.

Berkenhout became a cadet in a Prussian infantry regiment, where he was promoted to the rank of ensign and then captain. In 1756, at the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War, he left the Prussian service, and received a commission in an English regiment.

In 1760 he entered Edinburgh University as a medical student. From Edinburgh he went to the University of Leyden, where he took his degree of doctor of physic (medicine) on 13 May 1765. On his return to England he settled at Isleworth in Middlesex, It is stated in David Elisha Davy&#x27;s &#x27;Suffolk Collections&#x27; (xc. 403) that he practised for some time as a physician at Bury St Edmunds.

In 1778 Berkenhout was sent by the government with the Carlisle Peace Commission to America, quite covertly. The Continental Congress would not allow the Commission to go beyond New York; but Berkenhout managed to reach Philadelphia. He knew Arthur Lee, and through him contacted Richard Henry Lee. Suspicion arose in September that he was corrupting leading citizens; and he was detained and questioned, and thrown into prison. There Timothy Matlack and Benjamin Rush visited him, and verbal fencing ensued. In the end Berkenhout was paroled, and rejoined the commissioners at New York on 19 September; but the negotiations of the Carlisle Commission were dead. He came back to England, and was rewarded with a pension for his services.

Berkenhout died on 3 April 1791 at Besselsleigh near Oxford.

==Works==
While a student at Edinburgh Berkenhout published in 1762 a botanical lexicon, &quot;Clavis Anglica Linguæ Botanicæ Linnæi&quot;, second edition 1764, and third edition 1766. For his M.D. he wrote &quot;Dissertatio Medica inauguralis de Podagra&quot;, dedicated on publication to Baron de Bielfeld. In 1766 he published &quot;Pharmacopoeia Medici&quot;.

In 1769 appeared the first volume of Berkenhout&#x27;s &quot;Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain&quot;; the second volume followed in 1770, and the third in 1771. It was republished in 1773 (three volumes), and a revised edition in two volumes appeared in 1788 as &quot;A Synopsis of the Natural History of Great Britain&quot;. In his publication (1771) William Cadogan&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation on the Gout&quot; was &quot;Examined and Refuted&quot;.

In these works Berkenhout named the brown rat as the Norway Rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), not Linnaeus as is often claimed.

Berkenhout&#x27;s major work was &quot;Biographia Literaria, or a Biographical History of Literature, containing the lives of English, Scotch, and Irish authors, from the dawn of letters in these kingdoms to the present time, chronologically and classically arranged&quot; (1777, first volume only). In the preface he acknowledged his debt to George Steevens for the lives of poets. Steevens in fact used the work to put into circulation one of his hoaxes, a forged letter purporting to be from George Peele.

In 1780 Berkenhout published &quot;Lucubrations on Ways and Means&quot;, a proposal on the imposition of taxes. Some of the suggestions in it were adopted by Lord North, others subsequently by William Pitt the Younger. His &quot;Essay on the Bite of a Mad Dog&quot; appeared in 1783; &quot;Symptomatology&quot; in 1784. Berkenhout&#x27;s last work was &quot;Letters on Education to his Son at the University&quot;, 1790. In it he commented on the system of fagging in public schools.

Berkenhout also published &quot;Treatise on Hysterical and Hypochondriacal Diseases&quot; (1777), from the French of Pierre Pomme. In 1779 he edited a revised edition of John Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Admirals&quot;. He translated from Swedish, as &quot;Letters from an Old Man to a Young Prince&quot; (1756), Count Carl Gustaf Tessin&#x27;s letters to the future Gustavus III of Sweden. Richard Linnecar dedicated his &quot;Strictures on Freemasonry&quot; to Berkenhout.

<text>The Miyakoan language ( &quot;Myākufutsu/Myākufutsї&quot; or &quot;Sumafutsu/Sїmafutsї&quot;, ) is a diverse dialect cluster spoken in the Miyako Islands, located southwest of Okinawa. The combined population of the islands is about 52,000 (as of 2011). Miyakoan is a Southern Ryukyuan language, most closely related to Yaeyama. The number of competent native speakers is not known; as a consequence of Japanese language policy which refers to the language as the , reflected in the education system, people below the age of 60 tend to not use the language except in songs and rituals, and the younger generation mostly uses Japanese as their first language. Miyakoan is notable among the Japonic languages in that it allows non-nasal syllable-final consonants, something not found in most Japonic languages.

==Dialects==
The most divergent dialect is that of Tarama Island, the farthest island away. The other dialects cluster as Ikema–Irabu and Central Miyako. Given the low degree of mutual intelligibility, Tarama language is sometimes considered a distinct language in its own right.

An illustrative lexeme is the name of the plant &quot;Alocasia&quot; (evidently an Austronesian loan: Tagalog ). This varies as Central Miyako (Hirara, Ōgami) , Ikema , Irabu (Nagahama) , Tarama .

A short description of the Aragusuku dialect (spoken in the southeastern area of Miyako Island and not to be confused with the Yaeyama dialect of the same name) was published in 2022 by Wang Danning.

==Phonology==
The description here is mostly based on the Ōgami dialect, the Central Miyakoan dialect of the smallest of the Miyako islands, from Pellard (2009). There is additional description based on the Irabu dialect, the Ikema-Irabu dialect of the second largest of the Irabu islands.

Central Miyakoan dialects do not have pitch accent; therefore, they are of &quot;ikkei&quot; type, except for the dialects of Ikema, Karimata, Uechi, and Yonaha, which have at most three types of pitch accent. Tarama distinguishes three types of accent on the phonological word (stem plus clitics), e.g. , , ,

===Vowels===
There are five vowels in Ōgami.
 is truly unrounded, unlike the compressed Japanese &quot;u&quot;. It is centralized after . is rounded normally, but varies as . varies from to .

Numerous vowel sequences occur, and long vowels are treated as sequences of identical vowels, keeping the inventory at five.

Historical *i and *u centralized and merged to as *e and *o rose to /i/ and /u/. The blade of the tongue in is close to the alveolar ridge, and this feature has been inaccurately described as &quot;apical&quot; (it is actually laminal). In certain environments rises beyond vowel space to syllabic after and (especially before another voiced consonant) and, in dialects that have voiced stops, to after and :
: *pito &gt; pstu &#x27;person&#x27;, *kimo &gt; ksmu &#x27;liver&#x27;, *tabi &gt; tabz &#x27;journey&#x27; in Shimazato dialect.

Ōgami vowels other than are not subject to devoicing next to unvoiced consonants the way Japanese high vowels are. Sequences of phonetic consonants have been analyzed by Pellard (2009) as being phonemically consonantal as well.

In Irabu there are five main vowels and two rare mid vowels that occur in loanwords and some clitics.

===Consonants===
In Ōgami there are nine consonants, without a voicing contrast. (Most Miyakoan dialects do distinguish voicing.)

The plosives tend to be somewhat aspirated initially and voiced medially. There are maybe a dozen words with optionally voiced initial consonants, such as &quot;babe ~ pape&quot; (a sp. of fish) and &quot;gakspstu ~ kakspstu&quot; &#x27;glutton&#x27;, but Pellard suggests they may be loans (&quot;babe&quot; is found in other dialects, and &quot;gaks-&quot; is a Chinese loan; only a single word &quot;gama ~ kama&quot; &#x27;grotto, cave&#x27; is not an apparent loan).

 may be spirantized before : &quot;kaina&quot; &#x27;arm&#x27; , &quot;a꞊ka&quot; &#x27;I (nominative)&#x27; .

 is at the end of a word, and assimilates to succeeding consonants () before another consonant. When final geminates, it becomes ; compare &quot;tin&quot; &#x27;silver&#x27; with &quot;tinnu&quot; &#x27;silver (accusative)&#x27;. It tends to devoice after and . , on the other hand, does not assimilate and appears finally unchanged, as in &quot;mku&quot; &#x27;right&#x27;, &quot;mta&quot; &#x27;earth&#x27;, and &quot;im&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27;.

 is labiodental, not bilabial, and palatalizes to before the front vowels : &quot;pssi&quot; &#x27;cold&#x27;. Some speakers insert an epenthetic between and in what would otherwise be a sequence thereof, as in &quot;ansi&quot; &#x27;thus&#x27;.

 is clearly labiodental as well and tends to become a fricative when emphasized or when geminated, as in &#x27;calf&#x27;. It can be syllabic, as can all sonorants in Ōgami: &quot;vv&quot; &#x27;to sell&#x27;. Final contrasts with the high back vowels: &#x27;snake&#x27;, &#x27;stick&#x27;, &#x27;fly&#x27; are accusative with the clitic &quot;-u&quot;.

 is mainly heard in complementary distribution with , only occurring before vowels .

===Phonotactics===

Various sequences of consonants occur (&quot;mna&quot; &#x27;shell&#x27;, &quot;sta&quot; &#x27;under&#x27;, &quot;fta&quot; &#x27;lid&#x27;), and long consonants are bimoraic (&quot;sta&quot; &quot;fta&quot; , &quot;pstu&quot; ), so they are analyzed as consonant sequences as well. These can be typologically unusual:

: (sp. small fruit)
: &#x27;now&#x27;
: &#x27;you&#x27;
: &#x27;baby&#x27;
: &#x27;grass&#x27;
: &#x27;comb.&#x27; (from &quot;ff&quot; &#x27;comb&#x27;)
: &#x27;vegetable&#x27;
: &#x27;white&#x27;
: &#x27;dust.&#x27; (from &quot;ss&quot; &#x27;dust&#x27;)
: &#x27;mother&#x27;
: &#x27;potato.&#x27; (from &quot;mm&quot; &#x27;potato&#x27;)
: &#x27;day&#x27;

Geminate plosives do not occur, apart from a single morpheme, the quotative particle &quot;tta&quot;.

There are a few words with no voiced sounds at all (compare Nuxálk language § Syllables):

:&quot;ss&quot; &#x27;dust, a nest, to rub&#x27;
:&quot;kss&quot; &#x27;breast/milk, hook / to fish, to come&#x27;
:&quot;pss&quot; &#x27;day, vulva&#x27;
:&quot;ff&quot; &#x27;a comb, to bite, to rain, to close&#x27;
:&quot;kff&quot; &#x27;to make&#x27;
:&quot;fks&quot; &#x27;to build&#x27;
:&quot;ksks&quot; &#x27;month, to listen, to arrive&#x27;, etc.
:&quot;sks&quot; &#x27;to cut&#x27;
:&quot;psks&quot; &#x27;to pull&#x27;

The contrast between a voiceless syllable and a voiced vowel between voiceless consonants can be seen in &quot;kff puskam&quot; &#x27;I want to make (it)&#x27;, &quot;ff꞊nkɑi&quot; &#x27;to꞊the.comb&#x27;, and &quot;paks꞊nu꞊tu&quot; &#x27;bee꞊꞊&#x27; (with a devoiced nasal after &quot;s&quot;). There is a contrast between &quot;ff꞊mɑi&quot; &#x27;comb꞊&#x27; and &quot;ffu꞊mɑi&quot; &#x27;shit꞊&#x27;. With tongue twisters, speakers do not insert schwas or other voiced sounds to aid in pronunciation:

:&quot;kff ff&quot; &#x27;the comb that I make&#x27;
:&quot;kff ss&quot; &#x27;the nest that I make&#x27;
:&quot;kff kss&quot; &#x27;the hook that I make&#x27;

The minimal word is either VV, VC, or CC (consisting of a single geminate), as in &quot;aa&quot; &#x27;millet&#x27;, &quot;ui&quot; &#x27;over&#x27;, &quot;is&quot; &#x27;rock&#x27;, &quot;ff&quot; &#x27;comb&#x27;. There are no V or CV words; however, CCV and CVV words are found, as shown above.

Syllabification is difficult to analyze, especially in words such as &quot;usnkai (us-nkai)&quot; &#x27;cow-&#x27; and &quot;saiafn (saiaf-n)&quot; &#x27;carpenter-&#x27;.

There are 15 to 16 consonants in Irabu, which do have a voicing contrast.

* The sequences are pronounced as [ʃ, tʃ].
* Sequences are heard as [ɭː, z̞z].
* /n/ is pronounced as a velar nasal [ŋ] when preceding /k/.
* /ʋ/ is heard as [v] within consonant clusters.
* /n/ can be heard as [ɲ] when preceding /i/ or /j/.
* is mostly phonetically pronounced as a less-fricated [z̞].
* /ɾ/ in word-final position is heard as [ɭ].
* /z̞/ is heard as voiceless [s̞] when occurring after a voiceless consonant.
* Palatalization [ʲ] occurs when consonants are preceding a palatal glide /j/ or a high-front /i/ (i.e. /mj, kj/; [mʲ, kʲ])
* Syllabic nasal sounds [m̩, n̩, (ŋ̩)], are heard in word-initial position when preceding consonants.

<text>The Fundamental Elements of Southtown is the third studio album and major label debut of American Christian nu metal band P.O.D., released through Atlantic Records on August 24, 1999. It went on to become the band&#x27;s first platinum album, peaking at No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in April 2000. It was the 143rd best-selling album of 2000 in the United States. &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot; became the album&#x27;s singles in 2000, both of which were accompanied by music videos. The album also includes a cover of U2&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;.

==Recording and production==
In 1998, P.O.D. signed a record deal with Atlantic Records. The band stayed with the label for eight years before announcing that they would be splitting from Atlantic Records in August 2006. Prior to signing with Atlantic Records, P.O.D. released their material through Rescue Records, which included a demo in 1993, two studio albums, &quot;Snuff the Punk&quot; (1994) and &quot;Brown&quot; (1996), and a live album, &quot;Payable on Death Live&quot;, in 1997. The band formed in 1992.

The same year the band was signed to Atlantic Records, P.O.D.&#x27;s first extended play, &quot;The Warriors EP&quot;, was released on Tooth &amp; Nail Records. Of the included seven songs on the EP, only &quot;Southtown&quot; would be re-recorded for P.O.D.&#x27;s third studio album. Only 30,000 units of &quot;The Warriors EP&quot; were produced. In 1999, P.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Demo EP&quot; by Atlantic Records contained demos of material that would later be re-recorded for &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, which included &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Lie Down,&quot; as well as early versions of the songs &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot; and &quot;Image&quot; titled &quot;Cutz&quot; and &quot;Breathe,&quot; respectively.

&quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; was recorded at three studios in California. The album was mixed at Image Recordings in Los Angeles, California and The Gallery in Sherman Oaks. According to bassist Traa Daniels during an interview in February 2000, the album was recorded in &quot;about three months&quot;.

In December 2012, vocalist Sonny Sandoval said the following about working with producer Howard Benson and being signed to a major record label:He allowed us not only to be ourselves but at the same time we were so stoked to have somebody that actually cared about our music. He gave us this advice and we took it and obviously you&#x27;re in a real studio and have real instruments. I remember Atlantic Records gave us a budget and we all went out and bought guitars and cabinets just because all our stuff was ghetto. This was big for us.

==Music videos==
The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook),&quot; received music videos that were produced by Angela Jones and directed by Marcos Siega; both music videos would later be included on P.O.D.&#x27;s VHS/DVD &quot;Still Payin&#x27; Dues&quot;, released on November 12, 2002.

==Album cover artwork==
When &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; was sold in Christian stores, a censored version of the artwork was used for the album&#x27;s front cover. Retailers complained about the depiction of a cigar and argued that the artwork featured &quot;pagan&quot; imagery according to a Deseret News article from September 2002.

==Touring and promotion==
In 2000, P.O.D. was a special guest band on Korn&#x27;s European tour. The band also performed at Ozzfest 2000. Later that year, P.O.D. embarked on the &quot;Kings of The Game&quot; tour with special guests Hed PE, Linkin Park, and Project 86. The tour began at Bogart&#x27;s in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 23, 2000, and ended at Cox Arena in San Diego, California on December 8, 2000; Dogwood and Living Sacrifice would replace Linkin Park and Hed PE as special guests at concerts from November 30 onwards.

To promote &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, a cassette tape with the songs &quot;Southtown&quot; and &quot;Rock the Party (Off the Hook)&quot; was released by Atlantic Records in 1999. &quot;Set Your Eyes to Zion&quot; was included on &quot;The Mark: A Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;WOW Hits 2001&quot; in 2000.

==Reception==
&quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Cross Rhythms gave the album a perfect score, describing it as &quot;a fine exponent of rap-core at finest, and the best album by P.O.D. thus far.&quot; In June 2000, Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the album &quot;drops Bob Marley refrains and makes common cause with U2 by covering that band&#x27;s &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky.&quot; Mostly, though, P.O.D. raps and rocks in a vigorous but commonplace manner.&quot;

The album was certified gold by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) on March 29, 2000, and later certified platinum on November 6, 2000.

==2008 reissue==
On August 4, 2008, a reissue of &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; was released exclusively on CD in Europe and South Africa, containing both it and &quot;Satellite&quot; (2001), the band&#x27;s fourth studio album. The album artwork on the reissue is uncensored and the song &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; is included as a bonus track.

==Legacy==
In an article by Cross Rhythms from February 2001, drummer Wuv Bernardo, following the success of &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; and the impact it had on the band, said &quot;We&#x27;ve been full time for six years and now it&#x27;s stepped up to a different level.&quot; Vocalist Sonny Sandoval said P.O.D. had been &quot;completely blown away by the success of the album&quot; according to an interview in July 2021.

In May 2011, album producer Howard Benson described &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; as &quot;one of the very first rock records made in Pro Tools that became huge. And then my career was off and running.&quot;

In October 2011, a piece by Jesus Freak Hideout said P.O.D. &quot;achieved their initial mainstream success&quot; because of the album.

In September 2017, Loudwire ranked &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; as the second best P.O.D. album, saying, &quot;The band’s hunger is infectious on the album&quot; and the &quot;Southtown&quot; single &quot;still sounds impactful and exciting.&quot; In January 2019, Loudwire&#x27;s &quot;15 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1999&quot; included the album at #14, saying, &quot;Atlantic picked up one of the brightest young bands of the time as they were starting work on their third full-length album.&quot; In January 2025, the publication ranked &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; at #21 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Nu-Metal Albums of All Time (Ranked)&quot;, saying it &quot;amplified the &quot;coolness&quot; factor and brought more reggae stylings to the band&#x27;s already successful sound&quot; and the songs &quot;read as fully realized and intentioned.&quot;

In December 2017, &quot;Set Your Eyes to Zion&quot; and &quot;Southtown&quot; were ranked at #9 and #5, respectively, on &quot;The 10 best P.O.D. songs&quot; list by Louder Sound.

In March 2018, Heaven&#x27;s Metal Magazine ranked &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; at #69 on their &quot;Top 100 Christian Metal Albums of all Time&quot; list, saying, &quot;This breakthrough release was huge.&quot;

In August 2018, New Release Today called the album &quot;a pivotal moment for P.O.D.&quot; and &quot;simultaneously sludgy and tight in aesthetic from start to finish.&quot;

In October 2020, Andrew Voigt of HM Magazine said he listened to the album &quot;religiously&quot;, saying P.O.D. &quot;offered heaviness, passion, and hope in an innovative way that other bands of that era hadn’t figured out and would later frequently try to imitate.&quot;

On April 23, 2021, P.O.D. announced on their official YouTube channel a series of livestream concerts called &quot;Satellite Over Southtown&quot;. During the series of shows, P.O.D. performed &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; live in its entirety on May 27, 2021.

In August 2024, David Allen, the designer of P.O.D.&#x27;s logo, wrote about &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; on Instagram, saying the band &quot;supported me and got me hired by Atlantic as a freelance designer. I got to go on the road and contribute some fun images to this album&quot;.

During a September 2024 interview with Sonny Sandoval, Riff Magazine said about &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, &quot;The record spawned a pair of hits and its faith-based message got the attention of the gospel music industry&quot;.

<doc id="973709" wikidata="Q3909328" url="?curid=973709" title="Portora Royal School">
<text>Portora Royal School located in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, was one of the &#x27;free schools&#x27; founded by the royal charter in 1608, by James I, making it one of the oldest schools in Ireland at the time of its closure. Originally called Enniskillen Royal School, the school was established some ten years after the Royal Decree, in 1618, 15 miles outside Enniskillen at Ballybalfour under the direction of Sir William Cole, before moving to Enniskillen in 1661. It was not until 1778 that the school moved to its final location on Portora Hill, Enniskillen, where the nucleus of the later all boys school was built. The school admitted a mixture of boarders and day pupils for much of its history, but became a day school in the 1990s.

On 28 June 2016, Portora Royal School closed. Portora Royal School amalgamated with Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School which launched the mixed Enniskillen Royal Grammar School on 1 September 2016, which is partially based on the original site of Portora Hill and the site of Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School.

Wilde&#x27;s name was painted over in 1895 following his imprisonment for homosexuality, which was criminalised in the United Kingdom. Additionally, initials he had carved into the window casement of a classroom as a student there were removed. His name was later reinstated on the Honours board.

==Formation of Enniskillen Royal Grammar School==
A proposal by the Department of Education to merge Portora Royal School with the Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School to form Enniskillen Royal Grammar School was approved by the Minister of Education, John O&#x27;Dowd, in June 2015 but the matter was taken to the High Court in October 2015 due to much local opposition. The High Court bid to stop the amalgamation of the two Enniskillen grammar schools failed.

<text>The Yaeyama language (, &quot;Yaimamuni&quot;) is a Southern Ryukyuan language spoken in the Yaeyama Islands, the southernmost inhabited island group in Japan, with a combined population of about 53,000. The Yaeyama Islands are situated in the Southern Ryukyu Islands, southwest of the Miyako Islands and to the east of Taiwan. Yaeyama (&quot;Yaimamunii&quot;) is most closely related to Miyako. The number of competent native speakers is not known; as a consequence of Japanese language policy which refers to the language as the , reflected in the education system, people below the age of 60 tend to not use the language except in songs and rituals, and the younger generation exclusively uses Japanese as their first language. As compared to the Japanese &quot;kokugo,&quot; or Japanese national language, other Ryukyuan languages such as Okinawan and Amami have also been referred to as dialects of Japanese. Yaeyama is noted as having a comparatively lower &quot;language vitality&quot; among neighboring Ryukyuan languages.

Yaeyama is spoken in Ishigaki, Taketomi, Kohama, Kuroshima, Hatoma, Aragusuku, Iriomote and Hateruma, with complications of mutual intelligibility between dialects as a result of the Yaeyama Islands&#x27; large geographic span. The speech of Yonaguni Island, while related, is usually considered a separate language. The Taketomi dialect may instead be a Northern Ryukyuan language common to Okinawan dialects that later converged with the other Yaeyama dialects.

== History ==
The Ryukyuan language split from Proto-Japonic when its speakers migrated to the Ryukyu Islands. The Ryukyuan languages split from Proto-Japonic in the last 2,000 years, though estimates offer different potential time periods ranging from 2 BCE to 800 CE.

The Yaeyaman languages are classified under a Macro-Yaeyama branch of the Southern Ryukyuan languages. Innovations in Southern Ryukyuan languages, splitting Macro-Yaeyama and Miyako language families, include an &quot;irregular shift from tone class B to A in &#x27;how many&#x27; and a special form for &#x27;garden&#x27;&quot;. Macro-Yaeyama innovations, grouping together Yaeyama languages and Dunan contain the &quot;grammaticalization of &#x27;know&#x27; as a potential auxiliary&quot;, similarities between multiple special forms such as &quot;bud&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;fresh&quot;, and &quot;dirt&quot;, as well as a semantic conflation of &quot;nephew&quot; to mean either &quot;nephew&quot; or &quot;niece&quot;. Yaeyaman dialects are differentiated from Dunan by innovations regarding a replacement of the verb &quot;sell&quot; with a causative form of &quot;buy&quot;, a special form of &quot;get wet&quot;, as well as an irregular shift of &quot;*g&gt;n&quot; in &#x27;beard&#x27;.

Some of the pronunciations that disappeared from Japanese around the 8th century, during Japan&#x27;s Nara period, can still be found in the Yaeyama languages. One example is the initial &quot;p&quot; sound, which in Japanese became an &quot;h&quot;, while remaining a &quot;p&quot; in Yaeyama, except for &quot;pu&quot;, which became &quot;fu&quot; in Yaeyama. 
While the Yaeyama language was more &quot;conservative&quot; in some aspects, in the sense of preserving certain pronunciations, in other aspects it was more innovative. One example is the vowel system. Old Japanese had eight vowels (some perhaps diphthongs); this has been reduced to five in modern Japanese, but in Yaeyaman, vowel reduction has progressed further, to three vowels. Generally, when modern Japanese has an &quot;e&quot;, the Yaeyama cognate will have an &quot;i&quot; (this is seen in &quot;funi&quot; above); and where modern Japanese has an &quot;o&quot;, the Yaeyama cognate will have a &quot;u&quot; (as seen in &quot;patu&quot; above).

However, in the cases where Proto-Japonic has an &quot;*e&quot;, &quot;*əy&quot;, or &quot;*o&quot; that is not word final, Japanese is no more conservative than Yaeyama in this regard, as both underwent the same vowel raising at different stages, as shown below:
Like all Southern Ryukyuan languages, Yaeyama shows a &quot;b&quot; word initially compared to Japanese &quot;w&quot;. This is perhaps believed to be an innovation from earlier &quot;w&quot;. This also includes Japanese cognates that once had an initial &quot;w&quot; but was dropped later in the history of the language, such as &quot;wodori&quot; &gt; &quot;odori&quot;.

Many of these features have been lost in the history of the Okinawan language or were innovated compared to all other Japonic languages. One explanation for this is that it is possible to travel by sea from mainland Japan to the main island of Okinawa while keeping one island or another in sight at nearly all times; but there is a larger gap between the main island of Okinawa and the Yaeyamas, which would have required several nights on the open sea. For this reason, there was less traffic between mainland Japan and the Yaeyama islands, allowing further linguistic divergence.

== Phonology ==
=== Hateruma ===
The Hateruma dialect contains seven vowels, with no distinction between long-short vowel length, and sixteen consonants. Hateruma is noted for having more vowels than any other dialect. A pharyngeal &quot;e&quot; is believed to be a result of &quot;the coalescence of Proto-Yaeyama diphthongs &#x27;*ai and *aɨ.&#x27;&quot;

There are three accent pitches present in Hateruma: falling, level, and rising accents. To correlate pitches, there are three classes of words under an &quot;A, B, C&quot; system; class A words correlate with the falling pitch, and class B and C are shown to have &quot;an uneven correspondence with the Level and Rising patterns.&quot;

The Hateruma dialect is regarded as an innovative variety of Yaeyama Ryukyuan. It is the only dialect of the Yaeyama group to feature the pharyngeal eˤ, sonorant devoicing, noun-final consonant epenthesis and spirantization of voiceless velar stop before the vowel *i. It is also considered to have the strongest aspiration among of the Yaeyama dialects, and is also the only variety to display nasal and liquid devoicing.

The pharyngeal eˤ may be regionally expressed as , especially among those over the age of 90.

Additionally, Hateruma has the following sixteen consonants:
=== Hatoma ===
The Hatoma dialect contains two &quot;tonal categories&quot;, denoted as marked and unmarked. Words of the marked class are analyzed as being &quot;high from the syllable containing the second mora&quot; and unmarked words begin from a low pitch but end with a low pitch. &quot;Peripheral tone classes&quot; are also noted in certain nouns and adverb.

Hatoma is noted for having the simplest verb conjugation and morphophonology of the Yaeyama dialects. One phonological process is a sequence of &quot;i&quot;, followed by &quot;e&quot;, becoming &quot;e&quot; in the case of &quot;i&quot; being in a light syllable and &quot;ja(a)&quot; in a heavy syllable. There is also a process of a sequence &quot;u&quot;, followed by &quot;a&quot; sequence becoming a long &quot;o&quot; with &quot;u&quot; in a light syllable and &quot;uwa(a)&quot; in a heavy syllable.

=== Miyara ===
The Miyara subdialect of Ishigaki has 21 consonants and 6 vowels in its inventory. It is noted that &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are always long, as in many varieties of Ryukyuan. Long vowels are often shortened before the moraic nasal.
Following , , and , underlying neutralizes to . After nasals (, ), glides (, ) alveolar stops (, ) or , , and , the high central vowel does not appear.

== Syntax ==
=== Hateruma ===
Hateruma uses morphology and suffixation in its verbs and adjectives. Derivational morphology expresses causative and passive forms in verbs; potential forms are equal to the passive form. Verbal inflection expresses two types of indicatives, an imperative form, as well as a cohortative and prohibitive ending. Adjectives, nouns and verbs also compound and reduplicate, especially in producing adverbs from adjectives.

Hateruma has a case system with nine case markings and particles. There are eleven auxiliary verbs to denote forms of mood and aspect.

=== Ishigaki ===
The Ishigaki dialect is noted for having a peculiar expression of cardinal directions. It is found that when speaking to other native speakers, Ishigaki-speakers use an &quot;intrinsic&quot; and &quot;relative&quot; frame of reference system in which &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; are expressed in an intrinsic frame of reference as the verbs &quot;agaru&quot; (&quot;go up, climb&quot;) and &quot;oriru (&quot;&quot;go down, descend&quot;), instead of Standard Japanese &quot;kita (&quot;&quot;north&quot;) and &quot;minami&quot; (&quot;south&quot;). It is found that most speakers express &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; as Standard Japanese &quot;hidari (&quot;&quot;left&quot;) and &quot;migi (&quot;&quot;right&quot;) in a relative frame of reference.

=== Miyara ===
Miyaran Yaeyama has been argued to have no marked attributive form, unlike Okinawan and Old Japanese. However, there is evidence that phonological conditioning, namely an epenthetic &quot;-r&quot; marking between present stative &quot;-i&quot; and present tense marker &quot;-u&quot; (in order to avoid subsequent vowel sequences)&quot;,&quot; accounts for non-overt attributive markings.

=== Wh-Questions ===
In Yaeyama, wh-phrases are marked with &quot;du&quot;, in contrast to Standard Japanese &quot;ka&quot;.

Omitting &quot;du&quot; from a wh-phrase is considered incorrect grammar. Yet, &quot;du&quot; marking is optional for adverbial or adjunct wh-phrases. In questions with multiple wh-words, only one can be marked with &quot;du&quot;. Further research is needed to learn more about Wh-questions in Yaeyama.

== Endangerment and revitalization ==
The endangerment of Ryukyuan languages is attributed to historical and governmental factors. Originating in the 1872 annexation of the Okinawan Islands to Japan and the creation of Okinawa Prefecture in 1879, there has since been a movement referred to as the &quot;Japanization of the Luchuan Islands&quot;. A national language movement known as &quot;kokugo&quot; has developed in result of this. The &quot;kokugo&quot; movement includes the 1907 implementation of the Ordinance of Dialect Regulation, demoting diverse Ryukyuan languages to the status of &quot;dialects&quot; (&quot;hogen&quot;) and discouraging of speaking these dialects in the Japanese school system.

There is estimated to be a remaining 7,000-10,000 Yaeyama speakers, mostly being spoken in the home. There have been many revival societies and movements erected to preserve Ryukyuan languages and culture. The earliest language revival movement is regarded as being part of the Koza Society of Culture, instituted in 1955. A large benefactor to preserving and reviving Ryukyuan languages is the Society for Spreading Okinawan (&quot;Uchinaguchi fukyu kyogikai)&quot;, whose constitution is dedicated to initiating dialect classes and Okinawan teacher training programs, as well as advancing towards a singular Okinawan orthography. There are also notable submovements in Ryukyuan language survival present in Okinawan radio broadcasts, as well as &quot;presentation circles and plays&quot; and language classes integrated in the Okinawan school curriculum on the local level.

<text>The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF) was a self-governing group of non-governmental organizations that acted to protect human rights throughout Europe, North America and Central Asia. A specific primary goal was to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and its follow-up documents.

==History==
It was founded in 1982, inspired in part by an appeal from Dr. Andrei Sakharov for the creation of a &quot;unified international committee to defend all Helsinki Watch Group members&quot;, and also to co-ordinate their work. The IHF was founded in response, both to provide an organization which the various independent Helsinki committees could use to support each other, as well as provide an international body to strengthen their work.

The original members were the independent Helsinki committees of Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United States; an international secretariat was established in Vienna. The secretariat supported and provided liaison member Helsinki committees and associated human rights groups, and represented them at the international political level. At the time IHF was dissolved, it had forty-six member committees.

The IHF also had direct links with individuals and groups supporting human rights in countries where no Helsinki committees exist. In addition to gathering and analyzing information on human rights conditions in OSCE countries, the IHF acted as a clearing house for this information, disseminating it to governments, inter-governmental organizations, the press and the public at large.

Karl zu Schwarzenberg served as chairman of the federation from 1984 to 1991. The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights was awarded the European Human Rights Prize in 1989, jointly with Lech Wałęsa. 

In January 2008, an Austrian court convicted the IHF&#x27;s former financial manager, the Austrian Rainer Tannenberger, of the embezzlement of €1.2 million. Tannenberger was sentenced to three years in prison, with two of them suspended. The IHF&#x27;s resulting insolvency had driven it to file for bankruptcy in Austria, its country of registration, and to be dissolved on 27 November 2007. An IHR accountant was sentenced to three years for embezzling $1.8 million from the Helsinki Federation for Human Rights to support his mistress. He channeled money from human rights projects to his bank account, and used the organization&#x27;s ATM card for personal purposes which went unnoticed for six years.

After its closure, IHF&#x27;s complete archives were transferred to the Blinken Open Society Archives which acts as the organisation&#x27;s official repository.

<doc id="973713" wikidata="Q34243" url="?curid=973713" title="Yonaguni language">
<text>The Yonaguni language ( &quot;Dunan Munui&quot;) is a Southern Ryukyuan language spoken by around 400 people on the island of Yonaguni, in the Ryukyu Islands, the westernmost of the chain lying just east of Taiwan. It is most closely related to Yaeyama. Due to the Japanese policy on languages, the language is not recognized by the government, which instead calls it the . As classified by UNESCO, the Yonaguni language is one of the most endangered languages in all of Japan, after the Ainu language.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===

The table below shows the vowels present in the Yonaguni language. Vowels which are only allophonic or marginal appear in parentheses.
: can also be recognized as an independent phoneme and not just as an allophone of . However, its distribution is very limited. Excluding a few interjections, the only morpheme in which it appears is the sentence-final, exclamatory particle &quot;do&quot;.

===Consonants===

The table below shows the consonants present in the Yonaguni language.


Plosive and affricate phonemes have three-way contrast. Hirayama et al. (1967) describe the contrast as voiceless non-laryngealized, voiceless laryngealized, and voiced. Yamada et al. (2015) describe the contrast as fortis (unaspirated and tense), lenis (weakly aspirated and lax), and voiced. The lenis/fortis distinction neutralized in word-medial positions, both becoming phonetically fortis.

In positions other than prevocalic, all nasals are phonetically homorganic with a following consonant (e.g. ng , nd , nb ). Nasals are velar () in final position.

===Phonological cognates===

As a Southern Ryukyuan language, Yonaguni, similar to Miyakoan and Yaeyama, has in place with Standard Japanese , such as Yonaguni (&#x27;stomach, belly&#x27;), cognate with Japanese (&#x27;guts, bowels&#x27;). Yonaguni also has where Japanese and other Ryukyuan languages have (orthographically &quot;y&quot;). Thus, for example, Yonaguni (&#x27;mountain&#x27;) is cognate with Japanese and Yaeyama (&#x27;id.&#x27;). Yonaguni is probably a recent development from an earlier , however, judging from the fact that even the in loanwords of Sinitic origin is pronounced by speakers of the Yonaguni language, such as &quot;dasai&quot; &#x27;vegetables&#x27; from Middle Chinese (). An entry in the late-15th-century Korean annals &quot;Seongjong Taewang Sillok&quot; records the local name of the island of Yonaguni in Idu script as 閏伊是麼, which has the Middle Korean reading &quot;zjuni sima&quot;, with &quot;sima&quot; glossed in the text as the Japonic word for &#x27;island&#x27;. That is direct evidence of an intermediate stage of the fortition - &gt; - &gt; -, leading to the modern name &#x27;Yonaguni&#x27;.

The Yonaguni language exhibits intervocalic voicing of plosives, as do many Japonic languages. It also exhibits the tendency for , especially when intervocalic, to be pronounced as a velar nasal , as in Standard Japanese.

===Syllable structure===

Below is the syllable template for Dunan:

:(C (G) ) V1 (V2) (N)

* C = consonant
* G = glide or 
* V = vowel
* N = moraic nasal

The onset allows for a single consonant with the occasional presence of a glide. The nucleus can contain up to two vowels. The only allowable coda is a moraic nasal.

==Writing system==
Yonaguni was once written with a unique writing system called Kaidā logograms. However, after conquest by the Ryukyu Kingdom and later annexation by the Empire of Japan, the logograms were replaced by Japanese kana and Kanji.

* /m/ before labial consonants and /ŋ/ before velar consonants. Example ディンブンキルン [dimbuŋkirun] &quot;to have a goal for&quot;.

<doc id="973725" wikidata="Q4950877" url="?curid=973725" title="Bowerman's Nose">
<text>Bowerman&#x27;s Nose is a stack of weathered granite on Dartmoor, Devon, England. It is situated on the northern slopes of Hayne Down, about a mile from Hound Tor and close to the village of Manaton at . It is about high and is the hard granite core of a former tor, standing above a &#x27;clitter&#x27; of the blocks that have eroded and fallen from it.

==Descriptions==
The height of the stack was exaggerated by early writers, and it was also regularly described as an ancient object of veneration. For example, Richard Polwhele described it in around 1800 as fifty feet high, and in the 1820s Carrington wrote of it:

In his contemporary notes to Carrington&#x27;s poem, W. Burt stated that the rocks rise to more than 30 feet, and he also mentioned that it was generally considered as a rock idol, dismissing those who doubted that druids were associated with the moor. Samuel Rowe in 1848 reckoned it was rather less than forty feet tall and likened it to the statues on Easter Island, saying that &quot;it is easy to conceive that [it] might have been pointed out to an ignorant and deluded people as the object of worship&quot;. He also said that from the higher ground to the south, its appearance was of a &quot;Hindoo idol, in a sitting posture&quot;.

By 1889, John Page wrote in his &quot;Exploration of Dartmoor&quot; that it was &quot;nearly forty feet&quot;, but discounted the &quot;rock idol&quot; tradition. John Chudleigh wrote in 1892 that from Manaton it looked like a Turk with a fez cap and mantle wrapped closely around his body. By 1907 it was still being described in Ward Lock&#x27;s Red Guide to Dartmoor as &quot;forty or fifty feet&quot; tall.

With a little imagination, it is possible to see the profile of a human face in the rocky outline, but as John Page said in 1889: &quot;If his nose bore any resemblance to the topmost layer of the pile, it cannot have boasted much comeliness.&quot; Other writers have seen the topmost layer as a cap, for instance Ruth St. Leger-Gordon wrote in 1965: &quot;With grey cap pushed well back from a face consisting mainly of the parrot-like feature which gives him his name...&quot;.

==Toponymy==
It used to be held that the name &quot;Bowerman&quot; was derived from the Celtic &quot;fawr maen&quot;, meaning &quot;the great stone&quot;, but this theory was refuted by R. Hansford Worth who pointed out that the correct Celtic form would have been &quot;maen fawr&quot;, so it could not have mutated into &quot;Bowerman&quot;.

Another derivation, noted by Burt, was that Bowerman was a hunter (a &quot;bow-man&quot;) who lived in the nearby village of Houndtor at the time of William the Conqueror. However, Eric Hemery noted that a John Bowerman was buried at North Bovey in 1663 and that the name also appears in a Dean Prior register of 1772, so it is possible that the name is of no great antiquity.

==Legend==
Not only is Bowerman&#x27;s Nose a spectacular rock formation, which appears on many local postcards and calendars, but it is also the subject of Dartmoor folklore.

One version of the local legend relates that a huntsman called Bowerman lived on the moor about a thousand years ago. When chasing a hare he and his pack of dogs unwittingly ran into a coven of witches, overturned their cauldron and disrupted their ceremony. They decided to punish him, and the next time he was hunting, one of the witches turned herself into a hare, and led both Bowerman and his hounds into a mire. As a final punishment, she turned them to stone - the dogs can be seen as a jagged chain of rocks on top of Hound Tor, while the huntsman himself became the rock formation now known as Bowerman&#x27;s Nose.

<doc id="973729" wikidata="Q65459" url="?curid=973729" title="Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus">
<text>Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus Latinized as Ludovicus Henricus Bojanus (16 July 1776 – 2 April 1827) was a Franco-German physician, comparative anatomist, and naturalist who spent most of his active career teaching veterinary medicine at Vilnius University in Tsarist Russia. His greatest work was a two-volume folio on the anatomy of the turtle &quot;Emys orbicularis&quot; published in 1819 and 1821. The Organ of Bojanus of molluscs is named after him. The Triassic mammal &quot;Lisowicia bojani&quot; was named in his honour in 2019.

== Life and work ==

Bojanus was born at Bouxwiller in Alsace, to Johann Jakob Bojanus (1740–1820) and Marie Eleonore Magdalene Kromayer. His younger sister Louise Friederike (1789–1880) married into the influential Merck family of Darmstadt. The family of Lutherans fled along with to Darmstadt during the French invasion of Alsace in 1789. He finished his secondary education in Darmstadt and studied medicine at the University of Jena (Dr. med., 1797). In 1804 he was appointed professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Vilnius, a post which he could assume only in 1806. In 1812 he fled to St Petersburg when Vilnius was invaded by Napoleon&#x27;s army and returned only in 1814. He began to teach comparative anatomy from 1814. In 1822 he was appointed rector of the university. Two years later, on medical advice, he returned to Darmstadt, where he died on 2 April 1827, a year after the death of his wife who took care of his medical needs.

Bojanus produced 70 works on anatomy and veterinary medicine with the most influential work being an illustrated book on the anatomy of turtles, &quot;Anatome Testudinis Europaeae&quot; (1819, 1821). This had 50 plates, illustrated on his own, on the anatomy of the European pond turtle &quot;Emys orbicularis&quot; based on dissections of at least 500 turtles according to his student and biographer Adam Ferdynand Adamowicz (1802–1881). He initially considered dedicating the book to Georges Cuvier but decided not to later, possibly due to the troubles he had faced from the French and due to his allegiance to Tsarist Russia. He printed 80 copies at a cost of 5000 rubles (about two years of his wages worth) which he paid for on his own, leading to financial difficulties. His student Adamowicz later became a veterinary professor at Vilnius. Other significant students included Karol Muyschel (1799-1843) and Fortunat Jurewicz (1801-1826). He made several discoveries, including a glandular organ in bivalve molluscs that is now known as the organ of Bojanus. He noted cercaria inside snails in 1818 and considered them as related to liver flukes but did not know about the life cycle. He described the auroch species (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;) and the steppe wisent (&quot;Bison priscus&quot;) providing distinction between them.

Bojanus married Wilhelmine Roose (1777–1826) in Vienna in 1803 and had no children of his own but had a stepdaughter Amelie (1819–1893). In 1814 he was elected corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St.Petersburg; in 1818 he became a member of the Imperial Leopold-Caroline Academy of Natural Sciences then in Bonn, and in 1821 was a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<text>Helsinki Watch was a private American non-governmental organization established by Robert L. Bernstein in 1978, designed to monitor the former Soviet Union&#x27;s compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords. Expanding in size and scope, Helsinki Watch began using media coverage to document human-rights violations committed by abusive governments. Since its inception, it produced several other watch committees dedicated to monitoring human rights in other parts of the world. In 1988, Helsinki Watch and its companion watch committees combined to form Human Rights Watch.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Following the multinational agreement establishing the Helsinki Accords in 1975, the Helsinki Watch was established to ensure Eastern Bloc countries undergoing severe civil conflict comply with the provisions originally established in the Helsinki Accords. This was the result of an emergence of pressing requests on behalf of organizations located in Moscow, Prague, and Warsaw who were tasked with monitoring the Soviet Union and regions of Eastern Europe to ensure their compliance in facilitating various human rights pledges made throughout the Accords, many of which were arrested by Soviet authorities in early 1977. One of the primary objectives of Helsinki Watch was to serve as an instrument of advocacy for freeing the imprisoned monitors arrested by Soviet officials, but its most noteworthy accomplishments was predicated on promoting civil and political freedoms in the Soviet Union and regions of Eastern Europe. Helsinki Watch developed a means of identifying the corrupt actions of governments by publicly acknowledging unethical behaviour carried out by different governmental bodies through media coverage and directly through policymakers on an international scale.

===Transition to Human Rights Watch===
As tensions built between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Americas Watch was created in 1981 in attempt to discredit criticism of double standards and covert geopolitical mission. The Americas Watch set out to observe and acknowledge abuses carried out by governmental bodies situated in Central America, and most notably criticized governments such as the United States for their involvement in providing arms and support to dangerous regimes situated in the Americas. The establishment of other similar organizations rapidly increased through their classification as &quot;The Watch Committees&quot; with the creation of Asia Watch (1985), Africa Watch (1986), and Middle East Watch (1989). In 1988, these committees formally adopted the overarching title of The Human Rights Watch.

===Funding===
The establishment of the Helsinki Watch was made possible by a $400,000 grant donated by the Ford Foundation.

===Timeline===

*1978 - Creation of Helsinki Watch
*1981 - Creation of Americas Watch
*1985 - Creation of Asia Watch
*1988 - Creation of Africa Watch 
*1988 - Creation of Human Rights Watch
*1989 - Creation of Middle East Watch

==Effectiveness==
Upon its establishment, Helsinki Watch immediately became a major organization with significant leverage internationally. Initially, Helsinki Watch would directly appeal to communist leaders by creating petitions and publicly &quot;naming and shaming&quot; abusive governments. When this method proved to be ineffective, they quickly graduated to using political influence from important Western and European politicians to further their mission of influencing government policy both directly and indirectly. As Helsinki Watch grew, it continued to build its reputation for providing accurate and reliable information on human rights violations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The Helsinki Watch is said to have played an important role in shaping human rights in the 1980s.

==Criticism==
Helsinki Watch attracted some allegations of bias during its early days. It was criticized for narrowing its scope to human-rights violations committed by the Soviet bloc while ignoring human-rights violations that were occurring in other parts of the world. Many suggested that its strategy of enlisting the help of Europeans to denounce the Soviet Union reflected this. It was specifically criticized for being lopsided in its mission, as in its early days it neglected to recognize abuses taking place within United States. In response to such criticism, the founders of Helsinki Watch created a new division called Americas Watch. From there the organization expanded rapidly, establishing Watches to cover other parts of the world. In 1988, all of the Helsinki Watch&#x27;s separate divisions were amalgamated into one unit called the Human Rights Watch.

==Major publications==
Published in 1991, major publications of Helsinki Watch include:

* &quot;Destroying Ethnic Identity: The Persecution of Gypsies in Romania&quot;: Helsinki Watch conducted an interview with regard to eleven attacks on the Romanian Romani. 
* &quot;Glasnost in Jeopardy: Human Rights in the USSR&quot;: An overview of the legal, social and governmental institutions and ways they have created difficulties for the development of human rights in the Soviet Union. The book describes the former president of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s attempt to reestablish law and order within the Soviet Union.
* &quot;Human Rights in Northern Ireland&quot;: This book reports the issues surrounding the Troubles within Northern Ireland and helps readers better understand the legal aspects of fighting among parties.
* &quot;Since the Revolution: Human Rights in Romania&quot;: This publication shows the attempt of new political culture after the revolution in 1989.

<doc id="973735" wikidata="Q6829195" url="?curid=973735" title="Michael Chamberlain">
<text>Michael Leigh Chamberlain (27 February 1944 – 9 January 2017) was a New Zealand-Australian writer, teacher and pastor falsely implicated in the August 1980 death of his missing daughter Azaria, which was later demonstrated to be the result of a dingo attack while the family was camping near Uluru (then usually called Ayers Rock) in the Northern Territory, Australia. Chamberlain&#x27;s then-wife Lindy was falsely convicted of the baby&#x27;s murder in 1982 and he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. The findings of a 1987 royal commission ultimately exonerated the couple, but not before they were subjected to sensationalist reporting and intense public scrutiny.

==Early life and pastoral career==
Chamberlain was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, the eldest son of Ivan and Greta Chamberlain. His father served as a warrant officer in the Royal New Zealand Air Force during World War II, while his mother was involved with the administration of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in southern New Zealand.

Educated at Lincoln High School and Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School, Chamberlain commenced studies at the University of Canterbury but after converting to the Seventh-day Adventist Church in 1965, he left and migrated to Australia. He subsequently studied at Avondale College in Cooranbong and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Theology) degree in 1969. He married Lindy Murchison the same year, after meeting her in 1968.

After graduating, Chamberlain worked as a Seventh-day Adventist minister in Tasmania, where Lindy Chamberlain gave birth to two children—Aidan (born 1973) and Regan (born 1976). In 1977 the family moved to Queensland, where Chamberlain produced and presented a radio program called &quot;The Good Life&quot;, a commentary on lifestyle and culture throughout the northern parts of the state. The Chamberlains&#x27; third child, daughter Azaria, was born in Mount Isa on 11 June 1980.

==Death of Azaria==
In August 1980, the Chamberlain family holidayed in Darwin, Northern Territory, where Michael intended to fish for barramundi. Lindy Chamberlain, however, had visited Uluru/Ayers Rock when she was 16 and wished to visit again, so the family travelled there with the intention of camping three days before continuing on to Darwin. The family had several encounters with dingoes after making camp at Uluru, including on the night of 17 August when Chamberlain fed one a piece of crust. Shortly before 8:00 pm, Lindy Chamberlain put Azaria to bed in their tent and returned to the campfire. After crying out at about 8:00 pm, Azaria disappeared from their tent, never to be seen again.

Investigators observed prints on the floor of the tent and bloodstained clothing belonging to the child was later discovered amongst rocks near the base of Uluru. The coronial inquest in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, in 1981 concluded that the baby had been taken by a dingo; however, this finding was overturned by another inquest in Darwin in 1982. Lindy Chamberlain was subsequently tried for murder and given a life sentence, while Michael was convicted of being an accessory after the fact and given an eighteen-month suspended sentence.

During her imprisonment in Darwin, Lindy Chamberlain gave birth to the couple&#x27;s fourth child, Kahlia (born 1982). Two weeks later, Chamberlain was awarded a Master of Arts degree through Andrews University. He later attributed his perseverance in studying for the degree during this difficult period as motivated by anger towards the Northern Territory government.

The final resolution of the case was triggered by a chance discovery. In early 1986, English tourist David Brett fell to his death from Uluru during an evening climb. Because of the vast size of the rock and the scrubby nature of the surrounding terrain, it was eight days before Brett&#x27;s remains were discovered, lying below the bluff where he had lost his footing and in an area full of dingo lairs. As police searched the area, looking for missing bones that might have been carried off by dingoes, they discovered a small item of clothing. It was quickly identified as the crucial missing piece of evidence from the Chamberlain case—Azaria&#x27;s missing matinee jacket.

The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory ordered Lindy Chamberlain&#x27;s immediate release and the case was reopened. A 1987 Royal Commission examined the case against the Chamberlains and the science behind key forensic evidence was challenged. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain. The exoneration was based on a rejection of the two key points of the prosecution&#x27;s case—particularly the alleged fetal haemoglobin evidence—and of bias and invalid assumptions made during the initial trial.

Following their exoneration, the Chamberlains&#x27; relationship deteriorated and they divorced in 1991. Three years later, Chamberlain married Ingrid Bergner and in 1996 they had a daughter named Zahra.

==Later life==
In 2002, Chamberlain attained a Doctor of Philosophy (education) degree from the University of Newcastle for his thesis entitled &quot;The changing role of Ellen White in Seventh-day Adventism with reference to sociocultural standards at Avondale College&quot;. That same year he graduated from Avondale College with a Bachelor of Teaching degree, qualifying him to teach high school English and history.

===State election===
Chamberlain stood as a Liberal candidate for the seat of Lake Macquarie in the 2003 New South Wales parliamentary election, achieving a 5.2% swing against sitting member Jeff Hunter. However, the swing was not enough to claim the seat and Chamberlain went on to accept a three-year teaching post at an Aboriginal high school in Brewarrina, New South Wales. While living there, Chamberlain was twice assaulted by a man accusing him of murdering Azaria; the man was convicted of assault and jailed.

===Teaching career and publishing===
Chamberlain returned to Cooranbong in 2006 and taught at Gosford High School until 2008, when he retired. In the same year he had published the book &quot;Beyond Ellen White: Seventh-day Adventism in Transition&quot;, a fully documented book based on his doctoral thesis at the University of Newcastle. In 2012, New Holland Publishers published his fourth book, &quot;Heart of Stone&quot;, on the eve of the fourth and final inquest into the disappearance of his daughter at Uluru. The coroner declared that a dingo had indeed killed Azaria and apologised to the family for the tragedy and for it taking 32 years to get to the truth. In 2014 the National Museum of Australia acquired Chamberlain&#x27;s V8 Hatchback Holden Torana. In 2016, Chamberlain was appointed a conjoint professor at the University of Newcastle. He was a conjoint research fellow in the School of Education, Faculty of Humanities, and Social Sciences.

==Death==
Chamberlain died on 9 January 2017, aged 72, at Gosford Hospital on the New South Wales Central Coast due to complications of acute leukaemia, and had a farewell service held at the Avondale College&#x27;s Seventh-day Adventist Church one week later.
==In popular culture==
Chamberlain is portrayed by Sam Neill in the 1988 film &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (released as &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot; outside Australia and New Zealand).

All four music videos were included on P.O.D.&#x27;s VHS/DVD &quot;Still Payin&#x27; Dues&quot;, released on November 12, 2002.

To promote &quot;Satellite&quot;, a sampler CD with the songs &quot;Alive,&quot; &quot;Boom,&quot; &quot;Masterpiece Conspiracy,&quot; and &quot;Set It Off&quot; was released by Atlantic Records in 2001. In a 2001 interview with Billboard, drummer and backing vocalist Wuv Bernardo said about &quot;Satellite&quot;:It’s just more mature. Some of the music is slowed down a bit. There’s more emotion going on.

&quot;Satellite&quot; was certified triple platinum by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) on August 26, 2002. &quot;Alive&quot; was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. Although not released as a single, &quot;Portrait&quot; was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2003 Grammy Awards. &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot; also earned a nomination in 2003 for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot;.

In July 2021, lead vocalist Sonny Sandoval said about the album:With &quot;Satellite&quot;, we wanted to be more universal, and we wanted people to be able to listen, relate and interpret what they get out of it.

==Reissues==
On July 29, 2002, a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; reissue of the album was announced. It includes a new front cover, three extra songs on the CD, and a bonus DVD containing video footage of four live songs and a behind the scenes video titled &quot;Into the Satellite&quot;. &quot;Satellite: Limited Edition&quot; was released on August 27, 2002; only 100,000 copies were produced.

A CD-exclusive reissue containing both &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; (1999), the band&#x27;s third studio album, was released in Europe and South Africa on August 4, 2008. The reissue includes the bonus track &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;.

On June 9, 2021, a remaster of &quot;Satellite&quot; was announced for the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary. The &quot;20th Anniversary Expanded Edition&quot; includes a second CD with one dozen bonus tracks and remastered audio; it was released physically on CD and digitally on September 3, 2021. The bonus material on the remaster consists of the three extra songs from the 2002 &quot;Limited Edition&quot; CD, &quot;Rock the Party (RTP Remix)&quot; (from the Japanese version of the original &quot;Satellite&quot; album), &quot;Critic&quot; and &quot;Youth of the Nation (Mike$ki Remix)&quot; (both from the Australian and European &quot;Satellite&quot; single), the instrumental song &quot;Sabbath&quot; (from &quot;The Warriors EP&quot; (1998)), &quot;School of Hard Knocks,&quot; and four previously unavailable demos, which include the songs &quot;Armageddon,&quot; &quot;Hold You Again,&quot; an alternate recording of &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; called &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Play Me Out,&quot; and a demo recording of &quot;Ridiculous&quot;.

A vinyl version of the remaster came out the following month on October 8, 2021. The vinyl reissue of &quot;Satellite&quot; does not include the extra songs from the CD and digital versions of the &quot;20th Anniversary Expanded Edition&quot;.

When discussing the inclusion of bonus content on the remastered version of &quot;Satellite&quot;, Sonny Sandoval stated during an interview in September 2021:We had demos, we had all kinds of stuff, so we were like, &quot;Okay. For that real fan that actually cares about that stuff, you know, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s throw it in there and kind of do a double album, double disc.&quot;

==Reception==
*&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (9/27/2001, pp. 67–8) – 4 stars out of 5 – &quot;Explodes beyond the confines of what has become a played-out sound... songs on a passion so fierce they&#x27;re almost exhausting to listen to... Without resorting to ham-fisted angst, P.O.D. push all the right emotional buttons.&quot;
*&quot;Spin&quot; (p. 89) – &quot;[They] sang from the heart about school shootings, losing parents, and being truly alive.&quot;
*&quot;Q&quot; (1/02, p. 106) – 3 out of 5 stars - &quot;...heavy, angry, and very, very loud...many songs have messages of peace and spirituality...their Gen-X angst sounds genuine...&quot;
*&quot;CMJ&quot; (10/1/2001, p. 16) – &quot;[Its] honest spiritual subject matter coupled with crack-your-skull riffs work like a well-oiled machine.&quot;

==Legacy==
In July 2010, HM Magazine ranked &quot;Satellite&quot; as the second-best album on their &quot;Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of all time&quot; list, saying it &quot;had perfect timing... and monster jams.&quot;

In September 2014, &quot;Revolver&quot; put &quot;Satellite&quot; on its &quot;10 Nu-Metal Albums You Need to Own&quot; list. In November 2021, the publication included &quot;Satellite&quot; on their &quot;20 Essential Nu-Metal Albums&quot;, saying &quot;P.O.D. exchanged the gnarlier hardcore of early albums like 1996&#x27;s &quot;Brown&quot; for hook-heavy, reggae-infused rap-rock&quot;.

In September 2017, Loudwire ranked &quot;Satellite&quot; as the band&#x27;s best album, calling it &quot;P.O.D.&#x27;s definitive album&quot; and &quot;a record that excels in all aspects&quot;. In February 2021, the album was included on Loudwire&#x27;s list of &quot;The 40 Best Rock Albums of 2001&quot;, saying, &quot;After their 1999 breakout, P.O.D. absolutely commanded the airwaves with 2001’s &quot;Satellite&quot;.&quot; In January 2025, the publication ranked &quot;Satellite&quot; at #28 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Nu-Metal Albums of All Time (Ranked)&quot;, describing it as &quot;Filled with reggae influenced hooks&quot; and saying the album &quot;blew past the band’s previous efforts&quot;.

In December 2017, &quot;Alive,&quot; &quot;Boom,&quot; and &quot;Youth of the Nation&quot; were ranked at #7, #4, and #1, respectively, on &quot;The 10 best P.O.D. songs&quot; list by Louder Sound.

In March 2018, Heaven&#x27;s Metal Magazine ranked &quot;Satellite&quot; at #18 on their &quot;Top 100 Christian Metal Albums of all Time&quot; list, saying, &quot;The band&#x27;s greatness and power gelled on this release, mixing melody with punch.&quot; In March 2021, the album was put on their list of &quot;Christian Metal Albums That Changed the Game&quot;, saying, &quot;Not only did &quot;Satellite&quot; sell ridiculously well, it was nominated for 3 Grammys in the Hard Rock and Metal categories.&quot; In December 2024, the publication included the album&#x27;s track &quot;Thinking About Forever&quot; on their &quot;15 Nu Metal Era Songs That Illuminate Faith and Struggle&quot; list.

In June 2020, Kerrang! included &quot;Satellite&quot; on &quot;The 21 greatest nu-metal albums of all time - ranked&quot; list, saying &quot;the San Diegan quartet pumped fresh lifeblood into the flagging nu-metal machine with this second major label offering.&quot;

P.O.D. announced on their official YouTube channel a series of livestream concerts called &quot;Satellite Over Southtown&quot; on April 23, 2021. The band performed &quot;Satellite&quot; live in its entirety on May 13, 2021.

A tour for &quot;Satellite&quot;&#x27;s twentieth anniversary was announced on June 8, 2021. The tour, which included the bands All Good Things, From Ashes to New, and Sleep Signals as special guests, began August 14 and ended October 7, 2021.

In September 2021, Daryl McIntosh of Albumism called &quot;Satellite&quot; &quot;timely with both its distinctive sound and refreshingly positive message.&quot; He stated, &quot;&quot;Satellite&quot; not only provided the much-needed musical encouragement, but also at times helped me recalibrate spiritually. P.O.D.’s unique fusion of various musical genres provided a sound unlike any other at the time or since.&quot;

Bassist and backing vocalist Traa Daniels said about the significance of &quot;Satellite&quot; during an interview in February 2023:You don&#x27;t realize how much a difference you make until people come up to you and tell you that, you know, that record meant something to them.

<text>In computing, formatted text, styled text, or rich text, as opposed to plain text, is digital text which has styling information beyond the minimum of semantic elements: colours, styles (boldface, italic), sizes, and special features in HTML (such as hyperlinks).

==Terminology==
Formatted text cannot rightly be identified with binary files or be distinct from ASCII text. This is because formatted text is not necessarily binary, it may be text-only, such as HTML, RTF or enriched text files, and it may be ASCII-only. Conversely, a plain text file may be non-ASCII (in an encoding such as Unicode UTF-8). Text-only formatted text is achieved by markup which too is textual, while some editors of formatted text like Microsoft Word save in a binary format.

==Beginnings of formatted text==
Formatted text has its genesis in the pre-computer use of underscoring to embolden passages in typewritten manuscripts. In the first interactive systems of early computer technology, underlining was not possible, and users made up for this lack (and the lack of formatting in ASCII) by using certain symbols as substitutes. Emphasis, for example, could be achieved in ASCII in a number of ways:

* Capitalization: 
* Surrounding with underscores: 
* Surrounding with asterisks: 
* Spacing: 

Surrounding by underscores was also used for book titles: 

==Markup languages==
Formatting can be marked by tags distinguished from the body text by special characters, such as angle brackets in HTML. For example, this text:

:The dog is classified as &quot;Canis familiaris&quot; in taxonomy.

is marked up in HTML thus:

&lt;p&gt;The dog is classified as &lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris&lt;/i&gt; in taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

The italicised text is enclosed by an opening and a closing italics tag. In LaTeX, the text would be marked up like this:

The dog is classified as \textit{Canis familiaris} in taxonomy.

Most markup languages can be edited with any text editor, needing no special software. Many markup languages can also be edited with specialized software designed to automate some functions or present the output as WYSIWYG.

==Formatted document files==
Since the invention of MacWrite, the first WYSIWYG word processor, in which the typist codes the formatting visually rather than by inserting textual markup, word processors have tended to save to binary files. Opening such files with a text editor reveals them embedded with various binary characters, either around the formatted text (e.g. in WordPerfect) or separate from it, at the beginning or end of the file (e.g. in Microsoft Word).

Formatted text documents in binary files have, however, the disadvantages of formatting scope and secrecy. Whereas the extent of formatting is accurately marked in markup languages, WYSIWYG formatting is based on memory, that is, keeping for example your pressing of the boldface button until cancelled. This can lead to formatting mistakes and maintenance troubles. As for secrecy, formatted text document file formats tend to be proprietary and undocumented, leading to difficulty in coding compatibility by third parties, and also to unnecessary upgrades because of version changes.

WordStar was a popular word processor that did not use binary files with hidden characters.

OpenOffice.org Writer saves files in an XML format. However, the resultant file is a binary since it is compressed (a tarball equivalent).

PDF is another formatted text file format that is usually binary (using compression for the text, and storing graphics and fonts in binary). It is generally an end-user format, written from an application such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, and not editable by the user once done.

<doc id="973756" wikidata="Q2352311" url="?curid=973756" title="David Manning (fictitious writer)">
<text>David Manning (sometimes &quot;Dave&quot;) was a pseudonym used by a marketing executive around July 2000 to give consistently good reviews for releases from Sony subsidiary Columbia Pictures. Several fictional review quotes attributed to &quot;David Manning&quot; were used in the promotion of medieval action/drama &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (describing Heath Ledger as &quot;this year&#x27;s hottest new star!&quot;) and Rob Schneider&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Animal&quot; (&quot;Another winner!&quot;), the latter of which generally received poor reviews by real critics. The story emerged in mid-2001 in connection with the film &quot;The Patriot&quot;.

== Background ==
The usage of quotations in advertisement is an important part of film promotion. Film studios use quotations of reviews from film critics to demonstrate to the general public that the movie is worth their money and time. However, studios are given a lot of leeway on how quotations are represented. While advertisement campaigns must be approved by the Motion Picture Association, the MPA does not check quotations on advertisements for their accuracy. Because of this, studios may shorten quotes or remove context from them, both to keep things brief and to put as much positive spin as possible. In a 1999 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article about the role critics play in movie advertising, DreamWorks Pictures marketing executive Terry Press remarked, &quot;We are a sound bite culture [...] You just take the sound bite. If they didn&#x27;t say it exactly the way you want, you just take the part of what they said that you do want [...] and if they don&#x27;t say what you want, you just make it up yourself anyway.&quot; 

== Details ==
Manning was named after a friend of Matthew Cramer, the Sony marketing executive responsible for the insertions. Manning was credited to &quot;The Ridgefield Press&quot;, a small weekly newspaper from Ridgefield, Connecticut that actually published film reviews written by the father-and-son team of Mark and Jonathan Schumann. 

During an investigation into Manning&#x27;s quotes, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter John Horn discovered that the newspaper had never heard of him. The story emerged in mid-2001, around the same time as an announcement that Sony had used employees posing as moviegoers in television commercials to praise the Mel Gibson film &quot;The Patriot&quot;. These occurrences, in tandem, raised questions and controversy about ethics in film promotion practices.

On June 10, 2001, on an episode of &quot;Le Show&quot;, host Harry Shearer conducted an in-studio interview with David Manning. The voice of Manning was provided by a computer voice synthesizer.

On August 3, 2005, Sony made an out-of-court settlement and agreed to refund $5 each to dissatisfied customers who saw &quot;Hollow Man&quot;, &quot;The Animal&quot;, &quot;The Patriot&quot;, &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, or &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; in American theaters as a result of Manning&#x27;s reviews.

<doc id="973760" wikidata="Q2706553" url="?curid=973760" title="Payable on Death">
<text>Payable on Death is the self-titled fifth studio album by Christian nu metal band P.O.D. It is the group&#x27;s first album to feature guitarist Jason Truby following the controversial departure of Marcos Curiel, and their last album produced by Howard Benson (until &quot;Murdered Love&quot; in 2012). &quot;Payable on Death&quot; was released on November 4, 2003, through Atlantic and marks a notable de-emphasizing of the band&#x27;s distinctive rap metal style. While a commercial disappointment compared to &quot;Satellite&quot;, it still managed to sell over 1,300,000 copies worldwide.

==Background and recording==
Following the triple-platinum success of &quot;Satellite&quot;, P.O.D. enjoyed abundant radio, television, and concert success. However, on February 19, 2003, guitarist Marcos Curiel left the band under controversial circumstances, with contradictory reasons given from both parties. The remaining members expressed remorse in their friend&#x27;s departure and considered disbanding until Jason Truby, former member of Christian metal band Living Sacrifice, assisted with the recording of &quot;Sleeping Awake&quot;, from &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; soundtrack. The alliance strengthened the band and allowed them to begin recording a new album in spring 2003.

Yearning for a fresh start, the group rented a practice space in San Diego and started jamming with no expectations and no deadlines. Vocalist Sonny Sandoval explained, &quot;We took it back to the roots. We broke down the walls in this abandoned warehouse and set up shop. The doors were always open to our friends and family and people around San Diego to come through. And it was just more of a home vibe.&quot; According to bassist Traa Daniels, &quot;It was innocent and it was natural and fun.&quot; Within the first month of recording, P.O.D. had an unprecedented 17 songs to work with. The group also decided on the title &quot;Payable on Death&quot; both to set the record straight regarding the band&#x27;s initials and as a symbol of their rebirth.

Daniels stated the two rules in writing their fifth album as &quot;to never have any boundaries musically&quot; and &quot;to be as organic as we could possibly be.&quot; The latter meant not relying on ProTools and instead using an &quot;old school&quot; approach to recording. Daniels also explained their desire to &quot;just be a rock band. Period. Not a &quot;nu metal&quot; band, not any of these other categories and clichés that people have been trying to throw on us.&quot;

Guitarist Jason Truby expressed satisfaction with his participation in the songwriting process: &quot;Everyone respects each other and they let me be me and also we understand that there are boundaries. You can&#x27;t redefine P.O.D. and flip the whole page into some new band. It&#x27;s just P.O.D. and everybody brings something to the pot and puts their ingredient in, which kept it P.O.D. instead of it turning into &#x27;Okay, this is P.O.D. with Jason.

==Music and lyrics==
On &quot;Payable on Death&quot;, the band chose to head in a more traditional metal sound than the previous album, &quot;Satellite&quot;. Traa Daniels noted in May 2003 that the album would deal with the upsetting departure of Curiel but that &quot;a lot of these songs are coming out fun. We&#x27;re not a downer band. We&#x27;re not trying to get too deep.&quot; The sixth track, &quot;Revolution&quot;, and the last track, &quot;Eternal&quot;, feature Phil Keaggy. Jason Truby personally requested Keaggy&#x27;s presence on &quot;Eternal&quot;. The track features Truby playing acoustic rhythm alongside Keaggy&#x27;s electric guitar on lead.

==Touring and promotion==
&quot;Payable on Death&quot; did not venture heavily in the way of promotional singles. &quot;Will You&quot; served as its lead single which had an accompanying music video. Thematically, the song showcased a lesser known side of P.O.D. with a bitter love story in place of the band&#x27;s typical spiritual and urban themes. &quot;Change the World&quot; would be the follow-up, but didn&#x27;t manage to repeat the same level of success.

According to Sandoval, Metallica requested P.O.D. for the 2003 Summer Sanitarium Tour, but this conflicted with their recording schedule. They allegedly received many offers to tour at the beginning of 2004 and had hoped to join Metallica in January. P.O.D. played their first show with Jason Truby on August 30, 2003, in Morrison, Colorado and played various concerts for the remainder of the year, including the Voodoo Music Experience festival in New Orleans on Halloween. They also played at a Spike TV event in Las Vegas on December 2 and the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas concert.

In somewhat of a role reversal, P.O.D. co-headlined with Linkin Park on their Meteora US tour in early 2004. This marked their first US tour schedule with Truby. Following this, the band headlined their own theater tour of 40 cities beginning in May. Tour mates included Blindside, Lacuna Coil, and New Found Glory. P.O.D. were forced to cancel a May show in Columbus, Ohio, after Sandoval fell from the stage and bruised his ribs at a show a few days prior. They continued touring shortly after and performed at the Cornerstone Festival that summer. Two songs from the aforementioned concert would appear on the &quot;Warriors EP, Volume 2&quot; the following year. P.O.D.&#x27;s tour schedule also included the Street Scene festival in August and ran until late 2004 when they began work on a follow-up album.

==Release==
A few weeks after the official track listing was announced, the album&#x27;s lead single was posted online for streaming in September 2003. The first million copies of &quot;Payable on Death&quot; included a bonus PlayStation 2 DVD. This features a 50-minute documentary titled &quot;Inside P.O.D. Culture&quot; as well as an exclusive demo level of the video game &quot;Amplitude&quot;. The level allows players to remix an exclusive P.O.D. song titled &quot;Space&quot;, using its individual tracks. Also included is a key to a website that allowed fans to download &quot;Space&quot;.

The additional material prompted the album&#x27;s retail price to be slightly higher than average CDs and was viewed by &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Chris Nelson as &quot;a testament to just how desperate music companies are to stoke consumer interest&quot; in the face of free Internet music sharing.

===DualDisc edition===
&quot;Payable on Death&quot; was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc has the standard album on one side, and bonus material on the second side.

The DualDisc version was later reissued in a more widely distributed version. The original test market version differs from this common version in both packaging elements and in the design of the back of the inlay card.

===Cover art===
The album cover was designed and painted by Latino artist Daniel Martin Diaz. While Daniel claims he is a devout Catholic, some Christians felt the cover was negatively symbolic, and in a move previously experienced with &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, 85% of Christian music stores refused to carry the album. In response, Sonny Sandoval stated that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t care less&quot; and that the album was selling well regardless. Diaz was asked to compose the interior layout as well, which he completed in less than a week. All of these illustrations were taken from other paintings he created. When viewed in the original paintings, the symbolic meanings can be observed; most of the paintings contain Catholic imagery, combined with a fair amount of mysticism.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Reviews of &quot;Payable on Death&quot; varied and were very mixed, as Metacritic gave it a score of 54 out of 100. Truby&#x27;s guitar style gained much attention and was considered more technical and somewhat heavier than that of Curiel&#x27;s. AllMusic&#x27;s Matt Collar considered it a &quot;darker album than its predecessor&quot; and found that &quot;Truby unfortunately lacks some of the unexpected spark that Marcos brought to P.O.D. Fans of the band shouldn&#x27;t find much to complain about here though, even if the overall sound doesn&#x27;t stand out as distinctly from the nu-metal pack as &quot;Satellite&quot; did.&quot; Neil Drumming of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a largely scathing review of the album, stating, &quot;On track after formulaic track, perfunctory verses rush into roaring refrains of compressed guitar arrrgh and charmless didacticism.&quot; This negativity was largely mirrored by reviews in &quot;Blender&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

===Commercial success===
Having sold 106,000 copies in its first week, &quot;Payable on Death&quot; debuted at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on the strength of the first single and music video for &quot;Will You&quot;. The band filmed a video for the next single, &quot;Change the World&quot;, but it was never shipped to MTV. However, it did air on the lesser known Fuse TV. The album&#x27;s relatively poor sales compared to P.O.D.&#x27;s mammoth success, &quot;Satellite&quot;, have been partly attributed to a shakeup at Atlantic Records, leaving P.O.D. with no label support. Atlantic was sold to a private investor resulting in several thousand people, many of whom close to P.O.D., losing their jobs.

According to Soundscan, &quot;Payable on Death&quot; sold a little under 500,000 copies as of January 2006. However, it has shipped over 500,000 copies in the U.S.; therefore, &quot;Payable on Death&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA. Not until June 2004 did it pass the one-million sales mark. It has sold over 1,300,000 copies worldwide. It is credited as the last commercially successful album released by P.O.D.

<text>Lino Urdaneta (born November 20, 1979) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball relief pitcher and current pitching coach for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League. He played in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers and the New York Mets.

==Professional career==
After seven years in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians minor league systems, Urdaneta was selected by Detroit in the Rule 5 draft on December 15, 2003. Prior to joining the Tigers in 2004, he was sidelined due to inflammation in his right elbow.

Urdaneta made his Major League debut with the Tigers on September 9, 2004, allowing six earned runs without getting an out. Because of this, his career ERA was infinity.

On May 4, 2007, Urdaneta was brought up to the Major League roster by the Mets, replacing Chan Ho Park. He pitched in two games, lowering his career ERA to 63.00. Urdaneta was sent back down to Triple-A on May 15. On May 16, 2007, MLB suspended Urdaneta 50 games for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.

In his minor league career, Urdaneta compiled a 15–26 win–loss record with 49 saves, 204 strikeouts, and a 4.72 earned run average (ERA) in 217 games. He made the Florida State League All-Star Team in 2002.

In December 2023, Urdaneta joined the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League as bullpen coach.

<doc id="973766" wikidata="Q544071" url="?curid=973766" title="Tibia (video game)">
<text>Tibia is a multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 1997, developed and published by CipSoft. It is one of the earliest and longest-running MMORPGs, reaching its peak popularity in 2007. The game is free to play but players may pay to upgrade to a premium account. &quot;Tibia&quot; is a two-dimensional tile-based game set in a fantasy world with pixel art graphics and a top-down perspective.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tibia&quot; is a two-dimensional tile-based MMORPG with text-based elements. It is set in an open fantasy world that uses pixel art graphics, an oblique projection, and a top-down perspective. The core gameplay involves killing monsters to receive loot and gain experience, which causes the player to advance in level. Early in the game, players choose between one of four unique vocations, each of which uses different spells and abilities. Players may complete quests to receive rewards, kill bosses to obtain rare items, fight other players, form guilds, buy and decorate houses or guildhalls, or spend time on idle activities like fishing, training skills, or role-playing with other players. Interaction with Tibia&#x27;s NPCs is text-based, requiring the player to type keywords like &quot;Hi&quot; and &quot;Trade&quot; to interact with them, similar to many earlier text-based adventure games. Many of Tibia&#x27;s quests and activities require a team of players, and players can speak to each other using the client&#x27;s chat interface.
Tibia has four &#x27;vocations&#x27; - knight, paladin, druid, and sorcerer. Knights specialize in melee, paladins in distance fighting, sorcerers in offensive magic, and druids in healing magic. Once players choose their vocation, they will be permitted to take a ship to the mainland, where the rest of the game takes place. Once on the mainland, depending on the server&#x27;s PvP type, players may be permitted to attack each other. 

Tibia is an open world game that encourages exploration and discovery. Very little instruction is given once the player has reached the mainland, and the game is distinguished by its harsh penalty upon dying. Players progress in the game by upgrading their equipment, increasing their level, and completing quests to access restricted locations. Each level requires the player to accumulate more experience than the previous level, but unlike many other MMORPGs, &quot;Tibia&quot; does not have a level cap, so players are permitted to gain levels without limits.

===Setting===
In its early years &quot;Tibia&quot; took place in a medieval Tolkien-esque setting, but as years passed and new areas and content were added, inspiration was drawn from a wide range of fantasy, mythological, and historical influences, resulting in a diverse world of many continents, with seventeen major cities. NPCs have unique dialogue and responses to keywords provided by the player. NPCs can buy and sell items, give quests, provide information and hints, and tell stories. The world also contains many books and libraries that contain information, quest hints, tales, and history about the world of Tibia. &quot;Tibia&quot; contains many allusions to the outside world, including pop culture references, allusions to video games and books, mythological references, and more. The demonym of a &quot;Tibia&quot; player is &quot;Tibian&quot;.

===Combat===
Tibia has hundreds of weapons and armors used for fighting and protection from attacks. Melee fighting is the specialty of knights, who may choose to advance their sword, axe, or club skills, and who may also wear a large variety of armors and shields. Melee attacks only hit monsters on squares adjacent to the attacker. Ranged fighting is the specialty of paladins, who attack using an assortment of bows, crossbows, and throwing stars. Ranged attacks can hit monsters from many squares away, and different weapons have different attack ranges.

All four vocations can use magic to some degree. Sorcerers and druids have a wide variety of magic spells available to them, while paladins and knights have a limited variety. &quot;Tibia&quot;″s magic system is text-based. There are two types of magic: instant magic and rune magic. Instant magic uses spells that, once cast, will consume mana in order to produce the desired effect. Each spell uses spell words and consumes some of the character&#x27;s mana points to use. Some spells are offensive and deal damage to creatures, some heal the player, and others serve other purposes. To cast a spell, a player can type the words of the spell into the text channel. Typing &quot;exura gran&quot; casts the Greater Healing spell. &quot;Tibia&quot;″s client developed over the years to make spells easier and quicker to cast using hotkeys. Players may assign each spell to a hotkey, and press the hotkey when they wish to cast it.

Rune magic is magic cast by using an item called a rune. Runes are magic spells stored in small stones. To create runes, a player casts a spell while holding a blank rune in their inventory. Casting the spell &quot;adori mas flam&quot; consumes 530 mana and turns one blank rune into four &quot;Great Fireball&quot; runes, which may be stored in the player&#x27;s inventory and then used later. Players may buy both blank runes and spell runes from vendor NPCs, along with mana and health potions to restore hit points and mana.

===PvP===
Players in &quot;Tibia&quot; are allowed to attack and kill other players. The rules governing PvP vary depending on the player&#x27;s server type. Some servers, called Optional-PvP, don&#x27;t allow player killing except under certain circumstances, while other server types, such as Hardcore PvP, encourage such fighting where the player gains experience points for killing other players. In &quot;Tibia&quot;″s early years, players could kill any number of players without limits, and players who died lost a portion of their experience and dropped their backpacks and equipment. For this reason, &quot;Tibia&quot; earned a reputation for being a punishing, unforgiving game. Over the years, PvP rules were adjusted and modified, and a complex system is known as the &quot;skull system&quot; was implemented on Open-PvP servers to limit player killing. Many items and resources in &quot;Tibia&quot; are limited, and many intense large-scale wars have been fought in &quot;Tibia&quot; to decide who gets them.

===Houses and guildhalls===
Players are allowed to purchase houses and guildhalls in &quot;Tibia&quot;″s major cities. The houses sit in the view of those walking by, and players often decorate their houses in various ways. Some players display their rarest items, and others decorate their houses with roleplaying items such as tables and chairs.

==History and development==
&quot;Tibia&quot;&#x27;s development began in 1995 as a hobby project of German students Guido Lübke, Stephan Payer, Ulrich Schlott and Stephan Vogler under the name CIP Productions. The first server went online in January 1997 and its growing popularity led to the creation of CipSoft GmbH in June 2001. Premium accounts were introduced the same year, which allowed players to pay a monthly fee to gain additional in-game benefits. In the years that followed, more features were introduced, including map expansions, new outfits, new game mechanics including a &quot;skull system&quot; for PvP, and additional game worlds. The number of players online reached its peak at 64,028 players on November 28, 2007, with CipSoft reporting over 250,000 active players. According to a 2009 poll conducted by CipSoft, players came from a very wide range of countries, the largest numbers living in Brazil (26.56%) and Poland (24.38%). Other countries included Mexico, Sweden, the United States, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile, Canada, Venezuela, United Kingdom, and Germany.

&quot;Tibia&quot; has remained online up to the present, with developers releasing major content updates every six months. There are currently 68 game servers online, of which 24 in Europe, 25 in North America, and 19 in South America.

Before game updates test servers are run to find and repair bugs and glitches within the update. These servers are first available for testing to players that hold official positions such as Tutors, Fansite representatives and Senators. Test servers are sometimes opened to the general Tibian public. The major updates usually involve the creation of new cities, hunting areas, spells, weapons, etc. Updates may also include graphic redesign, gameplay changes, and anti-cheating measures. In addition to the major updates, as needed, minor updates are done throughout the year to fix bugs and other minor problems.

===Phasing out of Game Masters (GMs)===
In late 2010, CipSoft decided to phase-out the &quot;Game Master&quot; system which had been used since launch. The Game Masters, commonly known as &quot;GMs&quot; to the community were compensated for their time with a rare item of their choice. CipSoft implemented a new report statement function to the game client that players could use themselves, and the official course of action is for customer support to deal with all game queries. These representatives can be noted on the game&#x27;s forum boards as Community Managers, or &quot;CM&quot; for short.

===Level 999===
In 2005, a &quot;Tibia&quot; update added a door that requires a player to reach level 999 before it opens. The level 999 door remained a mystery until August 2016 when a player named Kharsek, the first player to reach level 999, entered the room. Kharsek, however, chose to keep their discoveries behind the door a secret, and the general public had to wait another ten months to learn the answer to the mystery of what lay behind the door. In June 2017, a player named Dev onica broadcast a live stream via their Twitch account, where they entered the level 999 door at level 1,001; they were transported to a tropical island with a variety of NPCs and no additional content of note.

==Support and rules==
The &quot;Tibian&quot; support system is made up of volunteer Tutors and paid Customer Support. Tutors are regular players who have no special or legal standing but can report in-game bugs as well as have access to a private chat channel and forums. Customer Support members are employees of CipSoft who handle cheating and bug reports. Retired gamemasters and long-term tutors may also, with prior invitation by CipSoft, choose to adopt the honorary title of Senator.

The role of tutor encompasses a number of duties including answering questions from the in-game Help Channel and on the Help board on the forum, checking the private tutor board and in-game channels regularly, and reporting bugs. All players are now able to report inappropriate statements, names, and posts in-game or on the forums which were previously a power held by tutors and higher positions.

Eligibility for the tutor position is determined if the player&#x27;s account is registered, has been played for at least three months with one character having at least level 20, their criminal record contains no banishment entries, and has received 40 &quot;Thank you!&#x27;s&quot; in the last 90 days. &quot;Thank you!&#x27;s&quot; are garnered when players submit them via the in-game Help channel or on the forums Help board indicating a player&#x27;s appreciation of someone&#x27;s assistance. Players &quot;previously&quot; had to take an online multiple-choice test on the official website to become a tutor and after 3 months of active tutorship without a bad/false report would be automatically promoted to the position of senior tutor.

===Rule violations===
Conduct from players and premium accounts are expected to abide by rules rather similar to most such games, including prohibitions against sharing or selling account information, exploiting &quot;obvious&quot; errors or flaws which give unreasonable advantages to a player, posing as CipSoft employees, using any and all non-official programs such as &quot;bots&quot;, and offensive behaviors. In such events, CipSoft uses a system of a violation record and conduct levels that grade both the severity and frequency of violations, with the &quot;conduct level&quot; slowly relenting over time with no new violations. Once a violation is entered in the record it can be protested until 60 days have lapsed, allowing players to protest inappropriate charges or complain if the charges are not understood; the entry cannot be expunged from the record later than that time. If the conduct level reaches its highest state, whether through continued minor violations or few very severe ones, the account is threatened with banishment (from the game and forum) or deletion. If an account has been banished or scheduled for deletion, CipSoft promulgates that the only recourse is to either create a new character or appeal to Customer Support directly.

By January 2009, CipSoft banned 4,959 characters for using illegal software while playing. A quote from CipSoft at the &quot;Tibia&quot; website states:
These accounts have been identified by an automatic tool with &quot;complete&quot; accuracy, therefore any complaints about these punishments are in vain. They are final and complaints will be ignored. We will neither reveal our criteria for these punishments, nor will we hand out any proofs.
The article goes on to say that CipSoft is not finished and will continue to work hard to eliminate cheating from the game. Since then, CipSoft has used this automatic tool about once a month to delete tens of thousands of accounts.

In September 2010, CipSoft made fundamental changes to the player versus player fighting mechanism, in an effort to mitigate abuse.

CipSoft implemented the anti-cheat software BattlEye, launched on 18 April 2017, with retroactive protection to other game-worlds over the course of a year.

<doc id="973768" wikidata="Q1712125" url="?curid=973768" title="Straight Records">
<text>Straight Records, self-identified simply as Straight, was a record label formed in 1969 to distribute productions and discoveries of Frank Zappa and his business partner/manager Herb Cohen. Straight was formed at the same time as a companion label, Bizarre Records. Straight and Bizarre were manufactured and distributed in the U.S. by the Warner Bros. Records family of labels, which also included Reprise Records. Straight recordings were distributed in the U.K. by CBS Records.

Frank Zappa chose the majority of the artists for the Straight label. His original intention was to release albums by avant-garde artists on Bizarre, and recordings by more mainstream artists on Straight. However the original concept failed to work out as expected due to issues with record distribution and artist management. Frank Zappa, the Mothers of Invention, Wild Man Fischer, and Lenny Bruce certainly fit in at Bizarre, but all others ended up on Straight. This led to some very unusual albums on the Straight label especially those by Captain Beefheart, Alice Cooper and the GTOs.

Zappa was also responsible for the Persuasions&#x27; first LP, &quot;Acapella&quot;. Over the phone he heard the Persuasions singing live in a Jersey City record shop. Due to his passion for doo-wop Zappa immediately flew the vocal group to Los Angeles to record. Other notable Straight artists included Tim Buckley, and the duo of Judy Henske &amp; Jerry Yester. These musicians came to the label through an association with manager Herb Cohen.

The first issue of &quot;Love It to Death&quot; by Alice Cooper was on Straight. However, by the time the album became a success it had already been re-issued on Warner Bros. Starting in 1972 this and other Straight recordings were re-issued by either Reprise or Warner Bros. By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight distribution agreement with Warner ended. Under a new agreement starting that year Zappa and Cohen&#x27;s business ventures with Warner were merged and renamed to create DiscReet Records. The Zappa/Cohen business partnership ended acrimoniously with litigation from both sides in 1976. In the settlement, reached a few years later, Zappa retained ownership of his work and Herb Cohen assumed ownership of most of the non-Zappa material from Bizarre, Straight and DiscReet.

In 1988 and 1989 Straight recordings by Captain Beefheart, Alice Cooper, Tim Buckley, the GTOs, the Persuasions, and Lord Buckley were briefly re-issued on CD and cassette by the Enigma Retro label. Zappa died at age 52 in 1993. Cohen died at age 77 in 2010.

Rumors have been made that since the early 1990s the ownership of some Straight recordings has become unclear. This may have prevented further re-issues of some Straight material. By the late 2000s, however, some of these recordings (such as Tim Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Blue Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Starsailor&quot;, and Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Lick My Decals Off Baby&quot;) have since been reissued on 180-gram vinyl and have been made available for sale on the iTunes Store. They have not, however, been reissued on CD. Whilst it has not been officially stated, it is believed that the clause preventing these albums&#x27; re-release only covered CD releases and not other formats. However, tracks from them have been licensed for and appeared on CD compilations in recent years.

<doc id="973769" wikidata="Q5913229" url="?curid=973769" title="Hound Tor">
<text>Hound Tor is a tor on Dartmoor, Devon, England and is a good example of a heavily weathered granite outcrop. It is easily accessible, situated within a few minutes from the B3387 between Bovey Tracey and Widecombe-in-the-Moor.

The site is administered by Dartmoor National Park Authority for English Heritage as it includes the ruins of a medieval village, alongside prehistoric works of stone construction nearby.

==Etymology==
Sabine Baring-Gould said that it derived its name from the shape assumed by the blocks on the summit that have been weathered into forms resembling the heads of dogs peering over the natural battlements.

==Medieval village==

To the south-east of the tor, on a north-eastern-facing slope are the remains of Hundatorra, a deserted medieval village. This was built on land farmed originally in the Bronze Age and which may have been used for grazing in the Roman period. The village was excavated between 1961 and 1975. It has four Dartmoor longhouses, many with a central drainage channel, and several smaller houses and barns. These buildings date from the 13th century. The three grain storage barns appear to have been adapted to include corn dryers, indicative of the deteriorating climate. Pollen evidence indicates that farming had stopped by 1350, but recent analysis of pottery suggests that the village was probably occupied until the late 14th or early 15th century.
The settlement is first mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Tavistock Abbey:
The villagers apparently left little behind when they left, though the acidic soil would have destroyed much evidence; the excavations unearthed a single coin from the time of Henry III, and some broken pottery originating from Crockerton in Wiltshire.

==Other archaeological remains==
There are a number of older remains of human occupation nearby, including a prehistoric farmstead 400 metres north-west of the settlement, and to the south are some Bronze Age hut circles.

Outlines of medieval fields can still be seen, especially from vantage points on top of the tor. The fields are bounded by &quot;corn ditches&quot; - granite walls fronting a ditch, with earth piled up behind the wall.

==Culture==
According to a local legend Hound Tor was created when a pack of hounds were turned to stone (see Bowerman&#x27;s Nose).

The 1975 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; was shot on location at Hound Tor.

It is also thought to have inspired a number of artists and writers, such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Establishing shots in the episode &quot;The Hounds of Baskerville&quot; from the television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; were set there.

The tor is popular with rock climbers.

The 2016 British Horror film The Unfolding was shot on location at Hound Tor and features the granite outcrop extensively in the film&#x27;s cinematography.

<doc id="973773" wikidata="Q653227" url="?curid=973773" title="Dawoodi Bohra">
<text>The Dawoodi Bohras are a religious denomination within the Ismā&#x27;īlī branch of Shia Islam. They number approximately one million worldwide and have settled in over 40 countries around the world. The majority of the Dawoodi Bohra community resides in India, with sizable congregations in Pakistan, Yemen, East Africa, and the Middle East. They also have a growing presence in Europe, North America, and Australia. The present leader is the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq, Mufaddal Saifuddin who assumed office in January 2014.

The Dawoodi Bohras profess Islam distinguished as the Shiah Fatimi Ismaili Tayyibi Dawoodi Bohras. Their faith is founded on the conviction that there is only one god, Allah, that the Holy Quran is the message of Allah, that the Islamic prophet Mohammed is the last of the Prophets, and that Ali is his legatee and successor. They follow the sharia-mandated tenets of Islam, such as reciting the Quran, performing the five daily prayers (Salah), annual tithes of 2.5% (or 1⁄40) of total income and savings (Zakat), fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm), the mandatory Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah and the Prophet&#x27;s shrine in Madinah and religious struggle (Jihad). 

At the core of their faith is the belief that the Ahl al-Bayt, members of the Prophet Mohammed&#x27;s family, are the rightful imams and like all Shia Muslims, they hold that Ali bin Abi Talib, the Prophet Mohammed&#x27;s legatee, succeeded him and provided an interpretation and explanation of the Holy Quran. A fundamental tenet of the Dawoodi Bohra faith is that there will always be an imam present on earth, who is descended from the Prophet&#x27;s grandson Imam Husain, to carry on the task of leading the faithful. When the Imam chooses to withdraw from public view (as is the case today), he is represented by the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq (an unrestricted missionary) who, like the Imam, preserves and protects the faith until the Imam&#x27;s return. Like the Imam, the Dai al-Mutlaq is infallible in all matters and is omniscient. After the 21st Imam chose seclusion in 1132AH, the Dai al-Mutlaq operated from Yemen and subsequently from India, for the last 300 years.

The Bohras are well-educated, typically wealthy traders, businesspersons, entrepreneurs and professionals (doctors, lawyers or accountants). The word &quot;Bohra&quot; comes from the Gujarati word &quot;vohrvu&quot; or &quot;vyavahar&quot;, meaning &quot;to trade&quot;. Their heritage is derived from the traditions of the Fatimid imams; direct descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima, who ruled over North Africa between the 10th and 11th century CE. Whilst adherence to traditional values is important for the community, they are also known for their mercantilism and forward outlook.

Lisan al-Da&#x27;wat is the language of the Bohras. The language is based on a Neo-Indo-Aryan language, Gujarati, but incorporates a heavy amount of Arabic, Urdu, and Persian vocabulary and is written in the Arabic script &quot;naskh&quot; style. The Bohras&#x27; cultural attire is known as Libas al-Anwar. Prominent religious festivals include Eid-e-Milad an-Nabi, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and Muharram. The majlis is an age-old practise of the community, who congregate on major dates in the Islamic calendar. The Bohra community during their gatherings, eat in groups of strictly eight, seated around a large aluminium platter called a thaal.

== History ==
Dawoodi Bohras are a subset of the Taiyebi sect of the Musta&#x27;li branch of Isma&#x27;ilism, itself a branch of Shia Islam. Reverence for the Fatimid Imams, whose lineage traces back to Mohammed&#x27;s daughter Fatima is fundamental to Bohras&#x27; beliefs.

=== Fatimid imams ===
The Fatimids, descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, ruled over North Africa and Egypt, Hejaz, and the Levant between the 10th and 11th centuries. They flourished during what Maurice Lombard called the Golden Age of Islam, and were patrons of arts, learning, and scientific discovery. The 14th Imam, al-Mui’zz, founded the city of Cairo and established Al-Azhar University, one of the oldest universities in the world.

Before the empire&#x27;s decline, Al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah, the 20th Fatimid imam, directed his grand emissary, Arwa bint Ahmad, the Sulayhid queen of Yemen, to establish the office of the &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; () to act as vicegerent for his son, the 21st Imam Al-Tayyib Abu&#x27;l-Qasim and to lead the faithful. Arwa bint Ahmad appointed Zoeb bin Musa as the first &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot;.

Succession to the office of &quot;al-Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; happens through &quot;nass&quot;, whereby each Da&#x27;i appoints a successor in his own lifetime. the chain of succession was uninterrupted.

=== Origins in India ===

The roots of the community&#x27;s establishment in India go back to the Fatimid era, when Al Mustansir Billah, the 18th Imam, sent a Dai named Abdullah from Yemen to initiate the Da’wah on his behalf. Abdullah arrived in Cambay (modern day Khambhat, Gujarat) in AD 1067/H 460 and soon won many converts, including local rulers. Abdullah was the first Wali (representative) in India.

The seclusion of al-Tayyib led to the establishment of the office of al-Dai al-Mutlaq in Yemen. The Indian community which had pledged allegiance to the Fatimids continued to remain loyal to the Dais in Yemen. This resulted in a secession with the Hafizis, led by Al-Tayyib&#x27;s uncle, Abd al-Majid. Twenty-three Dais operated from their mountain bases in Yemen for nearly four centuries, preserving the faith and authoring seminal works. The 19th Dai, Idris Imaduddin, wrote numerous works, including a comprehensive and detailed history of the Fatimid faith.

Meanwhile, the community in Gujarat had maintained ties with their Dais in Yemen, who closely supervised their affairs and regularly welcomed Bohra delegations from Gujarat. During this time, the community grew in size, especially in Cambay, Patan, Sidhpur, and Ahmedabad.

Yusuf bin Sulayman Najmuddin, originally from Sidhpur, a town in Gujarat, was one of the Bohras who travelled to Yemen to seek knowledge from the Dai. Najmuddin arrived in Yemen while still in his youth and first studied under Hasan bin Nuh al-Bharuchi. He was eventually appointed the 23rd Dai as his successor and became the first from the Indian community to lead the Tayyibi Da’wa as the 24th al-Mutlaq. When Najmuddin died in CE 1567/H 974, the central headquarters of the Da’wah were transferred from Yemen to Gujarat by his Indian successor, Jalal bin Hasan.

When the 26th al-Dai al-Mutlaq died in CE 1589/H 997, he was succeeded by Dawood Bin Qutubshah. However, three years later, Sulayman bin Hasan, a high-ranking dignitary in Yemen, claimed the succession to the leadership of the community for himself. This succession dispute was brought before the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1597. A special tribunal decided in favour of Dawood Bin Qutubshah. However, this did not dissolve tensions, leading to a schism in the community. A majority of Bohras acknowledged Dawood Bin Qutubshah as the rightful successor and henceforth came to be known as Dawoodis (or Da’udis.)

=== Major centres ===

Over the next few centuries, the Bohra headquarters moved within India with the changing location of the Dai. The centre of the Da’wah has been in six places: Ahmedabad (eight Dais, from 1567/974 to 1655/1065); Jamnagar in the Kathiawar region of Gujarat (five Dais, from 1655/1065 to 1737/1150); Ujjan in the present-day state of Madhya Pradesh (two Dais, from 1737/1150 to 1779/1193); Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh (one Dai, from 1779/1193 to 1785/1200); Surat in the present-day state of Gujarat (eight Dais, from 1785/1200 to 1933/1351) and Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, where the current Dai resides.

Starting in the early 19th century, some community members emigrated in search of better livelihoods. The first wave of Bohra traders to migrate to East Africa did so in the aftermath of a severe drought in Kathiawar. The 43rd Dai, Abdeali Saifuddin, invited 12,000 of his followers to Surat, and provided food, work and lodgings for all of them. His only conditions were that they learn and practice vocational skills, and he gave them their earnings when it was time for them to leave Surat. Many from this group decided to use this capital to venture forth to trade in East Africa.

A century on from Abdeali Saifuddin, Taher Saifuddin acceded to the office of al-Dai al-Mutlaq as the 51st Dai, He is credited with revitalising the community by restructuring its organisation on modern lines.

He shifted the community headquarters from Surat to Mumbai, which had become a major centre of trade and commerce in India. His emphasis on acquiring higher education across disciplines saw many young Dawoodi Bohras go on to settle in different parts of the world, resulting in thriving new communities.

== Faith and beliefs ==

=== Monotheism ===
As Muslims, the Dawoodi Bohras believe in Tawhid, Islam&#x27;s central monotheistic concept of a single, indivisible God (Allah). They recite the Shahada (Islamic holy creed): &quot;There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, Ali is the guardian of Allah&quot;.

=== Seven pillars ===
Walayah – devotion to Allah, Muhammad, his family, and his descendants – is the most important of the seven pillars of Islam according to the Dawoodi Bohra faith.

The other six pillars are tahaarat (purity in body and thought), salah (daily ritual prayers), zakaat (offering a portion of one&#x27;s income in the cause of Allah), sawm (fasting in the month of Ramadan), hajj (a ritual pilgrimage to Mecca), and jihad (striving in the way of Allah). The Bohras build mosques wherever they live to congregate for prayers and &quot;majalis&quot; (religious congregation) for the &quot;zikr&quot; of Allah and his prophets, imams, and da&#x27;is.

=== Leadership ===

During the seclusion of the Imam, his vicegerent, al-Dai al-Mutlaq was appointed to lead the community and administer, with complete authority, its secular and religious affairs.

The Dai preaches Quranic precepts, which are the foundation of the faith, and guides the community on the path of salvation. Over the nine centuries that this office has existed, each Dai is considered to have played an important role in shaping the community&#x27;s social and economic progress. Community members seek and abide by his counsel in different aspects of life.

The 1st Dai, Dhu&#x27;ayb bin Musa, was appointed in 1138 (532H) in Yemen by Queen Arwa bint Ahmed when the 21st Imam went into seclusion. Over the next 400 years, 23 Dais established the Dawat in Yemen. The seat of the Dawat then transferred from Yemen to India, where the 24th Dai, Yusuf bin Sulayman Najmuddin, became the first Dai to assume office from this region. Despite territorial and political upheavals through different periods, the Dais persevered and continued to lead the faithful and preserve the faith.

The current leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community is the 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq, Aali Qadr Mufaddal Saifuddin, who lives in India. Syedna Saifuddin is a direct descendant of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed, who was himself a descendant of the Prophet Abraham, through an unbroken chain of noble and august ancestry. His heritage to the Prophet Mohammed traces back through the Prophet&#x27;s daughter, Fatima al-Zahra, and her husband Ali ibn Abi Talib. From Fatima and Ali, the line continues through their son, Imam Hussein, and the subsequent Imams in the Ismaili tradition up to the fifth Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq. Mufaddal Saifuddin&#x27;s ancestors include Mir Mahamad Ali, Fakhr al-Din Shaheed, Abd al-Qadir Hakimuddin, Khanji Pheer and Syedi Lukman who were direct descendants of Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq.

==Demographics and culture==
As of 2021, there are an estimated 1 million Dawoodi Bohras around the world. The majority reside in the India and Pakistan. A sizeable diaspora is spread across Europe, North America, the Middle East, Asia and East Africa.

The Bohras are prosperous traders, industrialists, businesspersons or skilled professionals.

===Name and etymology===
The word &quot;Bohra&quot; takes root in the Gujarati word &quot;vohrvu&quot;, in reference to their traditional occupation as traders. The prefix &quot;Dawoodi&quot; is in reference to Dawood Bin Qutubshah, the 27th &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot;, who emerged as the leader of the majority following a schism in 1588.

=== Language ===
Dawoodi Bohras culture is a blend of Yemeni, Egyptian, Pakistani, Persian and Indian cultures. Their language Lisan al-Dawat, written in Perso-Arabic script, derives from Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Sanskrit, and Gujarati. Lisan al-Dawat, which takes its basic structure from Gujarati developed as a medium to articulate Islamic values and heritage. Though Arabic remains community&#x27;s dominant liturgical language, Lisan al-Dawat is its language of sermons and its medium of official and day-to-day communication.

=== Dress ===
The Dawoodi Bohras wear distinct attire. The men traditionally dress in a predominantly white, three-piece outfit: &quot;kurta&quot;, a form of tunic; &quot;saaya&quot;, an overcoat of equal length; and &quot;izaar&quot;, loose-fit trousers; with &quot;topi&quot;, a crocheted white cap with a gold design. Men, adhering to the customs of Muhammad, are expected to grow a full beard.

The women wear a two-piece dress called &quot;rida,&quot; distinct from hijab, purdah, and chador. Its distinguishing features are bright colors, decorative patterns and lace, and the fact that it does not cover a woman&#x27;s face. The &quot;rida&quot; is of any colour except black. A flap called &quot;pardi&quot; is folded to one side to allow a woman&#x27;s face to be visible, but it can be worn over the face when desired.

=== Cuisine ===

Joining each other for meals is a well-known Dawoodi Bohra custom. Families and friends gather around sharing the meal from a large circular aluminium platter called a &quot;thaal&quot;. The &quot;thaal&quot; is raised upon a &quot;kundali&quot; or &quot;tarakti&quot; made of wood or metal, on top of a &quot;safra&quot;, a large cloth that covers the floor. Each course of the meal is served one after the other for those seated at the &quot;thaal&quot; to share.

The meal begins and ends with a taste of salt, traditionally said to cleanse the palate and prevent diseases. Bohras wear a topi (skullcap) during the meal and eat with their hands. A common etiquette is to wash both hands using a &quot;chilamchi lota&quot; (basin and jug). At community feasts, the Bohras first eat (sweet dish), followed by (savoury dish), and then the main course. Food wastage is frowned upon. Those seated at the &quot;thaal&quot; are encouraged to take smaller portions and expected to finish whatever is taken.

The Bohra cuisine, influenced by Gujarati, Persian, Yemeni, Arabic and Egyptian cuisines, is known for its unique taste and dishes such as bohra-style biryani, &quot;dal chaawal palidu&quot; (rice, lentils, and curry), &quot;kheema samosa&quot; (minced mutton samosa), &quot;dabba gosht&quot; (&quot;steamed-mutton-in-a-box&quot;), and &quot;masala bateta&quot; (spicy potatoes).

== Traditions and practices ==
===Qardan Hasana===
Islam prohibits &quot;riba&quot; () and interest; the Dawoodi Bohras follow the practice of &quot;Qardan Hasana&quot; (), which means interest-free loans. Based on the ideal of benefitting the borrower (as opposed to the lender), this model has played an important role in the economic growth of the community.

Syedna Saifuddin has throughout his life been a strong advocate for Islamic finance principles. Saifuddin has actively promoted and expanded the Burhani Qardan Hasana Trust, which freely offers generous interest-free loans to community members.

Syedna Saifuddin has forbidden community members from bank saving, time deposits or borrowing, EMI finance schemes, overdrafts, contributing to or accepting money from insurance schemes, investments in commodities and stock markets, cryptocurrency, pension, mutual or retirement fund investments or use of credit cards: deeming them haram (forbidden) in Islam. Instead, he encourages strict adherence to traditional Islamic financial principles, urging followers to rely on community-based support systems rather than conventional financial instruments which are speculative in nature (gharar, maisir) or interest-based (riba). This approach has led to the development of numerous financial structures within the community, giving community members financial flexibility and integration with modern economic systems.

===Mithaq===
The rite of initiation for the Bohras is the &quot;mithaq&quot;. This ceremony is a covenant between the believer and God, effected through God&#x27;s representative on earth. The &quot;mithaq&quot; binds a believer to the duties owed to Allah, including an oath of allegiance: a vow to accept the spiritual guidance of the &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; wholeheartedly and without reservation. This ceremony, akin to baptism in Christianity, is mandatory to enter the fold of the faith.

The &quot;mithaq&quot; is first taken at whatever age a child is deemed to have reached maturity: most commonly, thirteen years for girls, fourteen or fifteen for boys. These vows are renewed throughout of a Bohra&#x27;s adult life.

=== Calendar ===

The Dawoodi Bohra follow a Fatimid-era tabular calendar which matches the lunar cycle of 354 days (and hence requires no adjustments). The odd-numbered months have 30 days and the even-numbered months have 29 days—except in a leap year when the 12th and final month, Zil Hajj, has 30 days. This contrasts with other Muslim communities, which base the beginnings of specific Islamic months on sightings of the moon crescent.

==== Occasions ====
Dawoodi Bohras observe all significant occasions on the Muslim calendar, such as Muharram, Ramadan, Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha and Mawlid al Nabi. They also observe some occasions particular to their sect, such as the death anniversaries of previous dais and the birthday of the current dai. These occasions typically bring together members of the community for educational sermons and communal meals.

During Ramadan, the 9th month of the Islamic calendar, the Dawoodi Bohras like rest of Islamic world, observe a mandatory fast from dawn to dusk. The Bohras congregate in their local mosques for daily prayers (particularly for the evening prayers), and break the day-long fast with the &quot;iftaar&quot; () meal together. Ramadan is a month of heightened spirituality activity for the Bohras that ends with Eid al-Fitr.

In the month of Zil Hajj the Bohras undertake &quot;hajj&quot; and all celebrate Eid al-Adha at its conclusion. In line with Shia traditions, on the 18th of Zil Hajj, the day Muhammad publicly anointed Ali ibn Abi Talib his successor, the Bohras mark celebrate Eid i-Ghadir by, observe fasting, and offering special prayers. Special prayers and congregations are also held during other major events such as the day Muhammad first began his &quot;Da&#x27;wah&quot; (), the night of Isra and Mi&#x27;raj, the birthday of Muhammad, the &quot;urs mubarak&quot; () of prominent community leaders, and the birthday of the current Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq.

====Muharram====

The grandson of Prophet Muhammad Husayn ibn Ali was martyred along with his family and companions on the plains of Karbala while on a journey from Mecca, through the deserts of modern-day Iraq, to Kufa. The Bohras believe that Husayn&#x27;s sacrifice was foretold by Muhammad, and that he was destined to change the course of Islam as a result of his martyrdom. Remembrance of the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, often linked to the hagiography of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, is among the most important events of the year for the Bohras.

Known as &quot;ʿAshara Mubāraka&quot; (), the Dawoodi Bohras congregate for a series of ten &quot;majālis&quot; () in the beginning of the month of For them, Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s martyrdom epitomizes the values of humanity, justice, and truth. They consider his sacrifice and stand against tyranny, to offer lessons in bravery, loyalty, and compassion. These values, they believe, inculcate in them a spirit of self-sacrifice, forbearance, and adherence to their faith.

During the &quot;ʿAshara Mubāraka&quot;, the Bohra communities all over the world host a series of &quot;majālis&quot; twice a day, one each in the morning and in the evening, recounting Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s sacrifice, which forms the central theme of the discourse. The &quot;majālis&quot; led by the &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; on occasion attract hundreds of thousands of followers.

===Traditions===
====Rasm-e Saifee====

To facilitate marriages among the Dawoodi Bohra, Taher Saifuddin, the 51st Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, started &quot;Rasm-e Saifee&quot; in Jamnagar and later institutionalised it . During &quot;Rasm-e Saifee&quot; multiple &quot;nikah&quot; are solemnized at the hands of the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq and his representatives.

Saifuddin&#x27;s son and successor, Mohammed Burhanuddin, founded the International Taiseer al-Nikah Committee (ITNC), which now organizes &quot;Rasm-e Saifee&quot; throughout the year at various &quot;religious events.&quot; Burhanuddin&#x27;s successor, Mufaddal Saifuddin, continues to uphold the tradition.

====Pilgrimages====

It is customary among the Bohras to visit mausoleums, mosques, and other places of religious importance in Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, and India. In most places, a community-administered complex (&quot;mazaar&quot;) provides accommodation, business centers, dining, and various recreational activities to the traveling Bohras.

A Bohra mausoleum typically has white exteriors with a golden finial at the apex of the dome. The interior is usually lit up in incandescent light and Quranic verses are inscribed on its walls. These mausoleums embody several meanings in the form of their structure and build. As an example, Raudat Tahera, an austere structure in Mumbai, has a range of intricacies its design. The inner height of Raudat Tahera is 80 feet above the plinth: the number signifies the age of Taher Saifuddin, who is buried there. The sanctum of the mausoleum is 51 × 51 feet, which symbolises Saifuddin&#x27;s position as the 51st Dai al-Mutlaq. The entire Quran is inscribed in gold on its walls, whilst &quot;Bismillah&quot; is engraved 113 times in precious stones, and four doors, one on each side of the wall, are clad with silver. The inner side of the dome proclaims, &quot;Allah holds the sky and earth together which none else can.&quot;
== Society ==
===Community centers===

The office of the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, known as &quot;Dawat-e-Hadiyah&quot;, manages the affairs of the close-knit Dawoodi Bohra community through a distributed network of &quot;Jamaat&quot; committees. The &quot;Dawat-e-Hadiyah&quot; head office is at &quot;Badri Mahal&quot; in Fort, Mumbai.

Several sub-committees and trusts administer different aspects of a local Bohra community under the purview of respective &quot;Jamat&quot; (also called &quot;Anjuman&quot;). Set up anywhere Bohras live and work, a &quot;jamat&quot; may number from a hundred to tens of thousands of Bohras. A resident &quot;Amil&quot;, appointed by the dai is the president of a given &quot;jamat&quot;. and administers and manages its socio-religious affairs. At the local mosque or &quot;markaz&quot; under his jurisdiction, the Amil leads daily prayers, and presides over sermons and discourses.

==== Masjid ====
The masjid is the nuclues of Dawoodi Bohra communitiesarounf the world. It was often the practice ofBohras who migrated to a new city or country to build a masjid (or a markaz- community center- if it was not possible to build a masjid). While a Dawoodi Bohra masjid is primarily a place of worship and congregation, it forms an important socio-cultural center for the community, the masjids are also a center for education and sessions of learning, in line with Fatimid traditions. A masjid complex usually houses a dining hall for communal meals, called a mawaid or jamaat khana, as well as classrooms and administrative offices. The masjid are predominantly constructed in a distinct Neo-Fatimid style,
with the names of Allah and verses from the Quran engraved on its walls. Some Dawoodi Bohra masjids in India, such as the newly restored Saifee Masjid in Bhendi Bazaar, Mumbai, feature a fusion of Fatimid, Indian, and classical architecture. The masjids are usually multi-storied structures, the main prayer hall on the ground floor is used by men while women participate in prayers and sermons from large galleries on the floors.
Building new and restoring old masjids is an important part of Dawoodi Bohra culture. The last half-century has seen a surge in the building of Bohra masjids across the world, especially after the landmark restoration of al-Jami al-Anwar (the mosque of al-Hakim) in Cairo in 1980.

==== Markaz ====

A Bohra community (or &quot;jamaat&quot;) is centered around a &quot;markaz&quot; when there is no existing mosque nearby.

Communal meals are served in dining halls called the &quot;jamaat khaana&quot;, which are generally part of the mosque complex.

===FMB community kitchen===
In 2012, Mohammed Burhanuddin, the 52nd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, established &quot;Faiz al-Mawaid al-Burhaniyah&quot; (FMB) community kitchens to deliver at least one meal per day to all Bohra families and to ensure no one goes to bed hungry. FMB proved beneficial to women in particular as household work reduced, freeing up time to pursue other activities. Meals are delivered in tiffin containers daily, and have a rotating menu. As of 2021, FMB community kitchens, usually built near mosques, are operational in every Bohra community throughout the world.

Whilst FMB has substantially increased food security within the Bohra community, in times of crisis (such as natural disaster or the COVID-19 pandemic), it has also supplied meals and provisions to the wider society.

===Education===

In line with Islamic traditions, the Bohras seek both religious and secular education. Men are encouraged to pursue careers in fields such as business, medicine, law and accounting. Guided by Syedna&#x27;s vision for women&#x27;s education, Home Science is recognized as a valuable field of study, empowering women with essential life skills and diverse career paths. Higher education is common in the community. Syedna Saifuddin has, for many years, advised Dawoodi Bohra students to complete university studies locally, and has emphatically proscribed going abroad or away from home for further study (with the exception of students attending Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah).

The community-run Madrasah Saifiyah Burhaniyah (MSB) chain of international co-ed schools teach sciences, humanities, and arts. In 1984, Mohammed Burhanuddin established the first MSB schools in Nairobi and Mumbai. As of 2021, 24 MSB schools operate in southeast Asia the Middle East and Africa affiliated to IGCSE and ICSE boards.

Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah (Jamea) is the community&#x27;s primary educational and cultural institute. Selected students pursue rigorous Islamic and Arabic studies for up to 11 years, and are trained to subsequently lead various institutions &quot;Dawat-e-Hadiyah&quot;. Aljamea&#x27;s predecessor is Dars-e-Saifee, an Islamic theology school established by the 43rd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq Abdeali Saifuddin, in 1814 in Surat, Gujarat. A century later, the 51st Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq Taher Saifuddin renovated and institutionalized it as a university. His son and successor, Mohammed Burhanuddin, further expanded its reach and scope, opening campuses in three more cities and establishing a dedicated center for Qur&#x27;anic sciences, Mahad al-Zahra. The second campus was founded in 1983 in Karachi, Pakistan. A third campus was established in Nairobi, Kenya in 2011, and a fourth in 2013 in Mumbai, India. The libraries of Jamea preserve rare Arabic manuscripts. Other departments of Jamea specialize in the art of Quran recitation, Arabic calligraphy, and Arabesque design.

A significant volume of literature, from Fatimid-era text to treatises, discourses and poetry the Dua&#x27;t Mutlaqeen are part of the Jamea curriculum. Per tradition, the current Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq presides over annual examinations (&quot;al-Imtihan al-Sanawi&quot;) every year. Senior Jamea students additionally undergo a public viva voce examination where they are questioned by rectors of the institute and occasionally by the Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq.

== Status of women ==
=== Overview ===
The status of women in the Bohra community underwent a major change in the latter half of the 20th century. According to Jonah Blank, women of the Bohra faith are among the best-educated women in the Indian subcontinent. Inspired by Syedna Saifuddin&#x27;s progressive outlook for women&#x27;s education, studying Home Science has empowered women with essential life skills, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. At an interfaith celebration of Eid al-Fitr hosted by the Bohra community of Detroit, Michigan, United States on 7 June 2019, U.S. Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence (Democrat, Michigan&#x27;s 14th congressional district) praised the Bohras for having &quot;used their voices to make progress on countless issues including gender equality and the environment.&quot;

Bohra women integrate business and work with their religious practices and cultural ethos, bolstered by time honoured community principles of women empowerment that can be traced back all the way to the Prophet Mohammed&#x27;s wife Khadija. Traditionally engaged in home-based businesses, such as knitting and sewing (encouraged in the Bohra community as &#x27;mighzal&#x27;), women are now increasingly expanding and transitioning to digital entrepreneurship, utilizing online platforms to market these diverse products. Supported by community institutions, they receive financial aid, training, and access to virtual markets, showcasing how digital ventures empower women while also allowing them to fulfil their commitments to their families.

=== Female circumcision ===

The Dawoodi Bohra practice what they call &quot;khatna&quot;, &quot;khafd&quot;, or &quot;khafz&quot;, a practice critics consider female genital mutilation (FGM). The procedure is for the most part performed without anaesthesia by a traditional circumciser when girls reach their seventh year. Non-Bohra women who seek to marry into the community are also required to undergo it. There are no authoritative studies on the extent of the practice among the Bohra. A 1911 Bombay census of unknown reliability noted that they were performing clitoridectomy. According to a 1991 article in &quot;Manushi&quot;, the Bohra remove either the clitoral hood or the tip of the clitoris. Supporters of the practice say that the Bohra remove only the clitoral hood or perform symbolic nicking, and that it should be referred to as &quot;female circumcision&quot;, not FGM.

Syedna Saifuddin supports the practice of female circumcision. In a sermon delivered in Mumbai in April 2016, Syedna Saifuddin stated that circumcision &quot;must be done&quot; for both men and women, though for women it should be performed secretly.

A qualitative study in 2018 carried out by WeSpeakOut, a group opposed to FGM, concluded that most Bohra girls experience Type I FGM, removal of the clitoral hood or clitoral glans. A gynaecologist who took part in the study examined 20 Bohra women and found that both the clitoris and clitoral hood had been cut in most cases. According to the Dawoodi Bohra Women&#x27;s Association for Religious Freedom, the study&#x27;s conclusions did not reflect the views of most Bohra women. They argue that female circumcision is a minor religious procedure involving only a small nick or excision on the clitoral hood or prepuce, which does not cause harm. The DBWRF position is that khafz is a centuries-old religious freedom and rite of passage for religious purity, comparable to male circumcision, and is not intended to control female sexuality. However, this position is contested by some members of the Bohra community and activists who oppose the practice.

Syedna&#x27;s Saifuddin&#x27;s administration has actively supported community members in their legal battles to exercise their religious freedoms, his UK-registered charity spent more than £800,000 on “costs incurred in defending four members of the Dawoodi Bohra congregation in Sydney in connection with female circumcision”. In 2018, the convictions of three members of the Bohra community, related to performing FGM on two girls, were overturned when the appeal court accepted that the tip of each girl&#x27;s clitoris was still visible and had not been &quot;mutilated&quot;; the defence position was that only &quot;symbolic khatna&quot; had been performed. The High Court of Australia overturned that decision in October 2019, ruling that the phrase &quot;otherwise mutilates&quot; in Australian law does encompass cutting or nicking the clitoris. As a result, the convictions were upheld, and the defendants received custodial sentences of at least 11 months.

The community has successfully defended an indictment brought against the practice by the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation by arguing that the US federal statute was unconstitutional. Syedna Saifuddin and Dawat E Hadiyah were advised by constitutional law scholar Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of Harvard University, on this landmark judgement.

== Social work &amp; Politics ==

As a minority community, Dawoodi Bohras maintain a policy to work with whichever incumbent government is ruling where they live. This approach allows them to foster harmony and goodwill with all governments while staying out of political disputes. As a result, in some circumstances, they form alliances with parties that might seem unexpected for a Muslim community. For instance, they have developed close ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, particularly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Similarly, they have maintained cordial relations with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. In Pakistan, Bohras have aligned themselves with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). These alliances, which may appear unconventional, stem from the community leadership&#x27;s clear focus on economic well-bring, rather than dogmatic political ideology or ethical considerations. 

The community&#x27;s stance, in line with sunnah, has been to be loyal to one&#x27;s country of residence irrespective of the political ideology of those is in power. Thus, the community has an unwavering focus on ensuring its own advancement and avoiding ideological or ethical confrontation. As a migratory minority community, Dawoodi Bohras participate in culture and society, but stay staunchly conservative to the Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa. Their belief is that every religion is related to one another, that all of creation shares the same purpose. and that true fulfillment is in achieved by quietly living harmoniously and skillfully navigating relationships to avoid conflicts.

=== The Burhani Foundation ===

In 1991, Mohammed Burhanuddin established the Burhani Foundation&quot;,&quot; a charitable trust for environmental awareness, conservation of biological diversity, effective utilisation of resources, pollution control, and other related cause. In 2017, Mufaddal Saifuddin, Burhanuddin&#x27;s successor, initiated a worldwide program to plant 200,000 tree saplings. In 2018, the Bohras, together with Champion of the Earth, launched Turning the Tide, a campaign to remove plastic from oceans, rivers, and beaches. On 6 November 2023, ahead of the COP28 World leaders summit, Shahzada Husain Burhanuddin on behalf of his fatherSyedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, attended the COP28 Global Faith leaders summit among 28 Faith leaders in Abu Dhabi and signed a joint appeal to take meaningful action in addressing climate crisis.

=== Zero food waste ===
Under the aegis of FMB, the Dana Committee () aims to eliminate food wastage. As of 2021, the committee has 7000 volunteers across 40 countries. After congregations, these volunteers collect untouched leftovers and distribute them to the deprived. To prevent wastage of food due to excess cooking or poor turnout, the committee uses custom web and mobile RSVP apps. Before a meal commences, volunteers remind attendees of their responsibility as Muslims in ensuring no food goes to waste. The Bohras also participate in the United Nations&#x27; annual World Food Day campaigns.

In September 2018, the Golden Book of World Record (GBWR) recognized and awarded the Dawoodi Bohra community for undertaking the largest zero-waste religious event as part of the community&#x27;s Ashara Mubaraka sermons in Indore. The event was attended by 150,000 Bohras, who had gathered in Indore to commemorate Ashara Mubaraka with Mufaddal Saifuddin, the 53rd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq. This zero-waste policy was also adopted at the 2019 Ashara Mubaraka in Colombo. Dana Committee volunteers helped with portion control and distributed leftover food to the disadvantaged.
In line with the UAE&#x27;s policy to mark 2023 as the Year of Sustainability, the 2023 Ashara Mubaraka in Dubai, attended by more than 75,000, also adopted a zero food wastage policy. The Ashara Mubaraka congregations also aligned with the UAE&#x27;s waste-to-energy initiative, in which organic waste collected during meals is converted into energy.

=== Embargo on Mobile Phones for Children ===
In a visionary and laudable move, Syedna Saifuddin has unveiled a groundbreaking initiative to safeguard the well-being of the community&#x27;s youngest members. With the wisdom of a sage and the foresight of a futurist, he has decreed a complete ban on mobile phone usage for children under the age of 15, a policy that has been embraced with fervour across the global Dawoodi Bohra community. This enlightened edict, announced during a sermon in Mumbai in December 2024, serves as a beacon of hope in an increasingly digitized world, where the siren call of screens threatens to ensnare young minds. By championing this revolutionary measure, Syedna Saifuddin has not only demonstrated his profound understanding of the perils of modern technology but has also reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to nurturing the physical, mental, and emotional health of the community&#x27;s children. This bold stance against the tide of technology addiction has ignited a global campaign within the Dawoodi Bohra community, fostering a renaissance of traditional values to cultivate a generation of well-rounded, mindful individuals.

=== Other initiatives ===
Project Rise

In June 2018, the Bohra community launched Project Rise, a philanthropy programme focused on the marginalized and the poor. Their first initiative, undertaken in collaboration with Action Against Hunger, sought to address malnutrition among those living in Palghar and Govandi districts of Maharashtra, India. During the 2019 floods, volunteers sent aid to the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat; while during the 2020 lockdown in India, volunteers distributed food packets among the poor. In 2020, Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India acknowledged the community&#x27;s social service. In 2019 and 2020, volunteers in North America marked United Nations World Food Day by donating to local food banks. Since then, based on Islamic traditions of philanthropy, Project Rise has expanded to launch programs that focus on healthcare, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene, and environmental conservation. As part of these drives, volunteers attempt to raise the standard of living of the disadvantaged through revamped housing, access to food, and improved well-being.

=== Bhendi Bazaar cluster redevelopment ===

In 2009, Mohammed Burhanuddin, the 52nd Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq, established Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) to undertake one of urban India&#x27;s largest makeover projects believed to impact lives of around 20,000 people. It&#x27;s mandate was to rebuild Bhendi Bazaar—a decrepit, under-developed, and dense muslim-majority locale in South Bombay. The redevelopment project spans over an area of 16.5 acres comprising 250 decrepit buildings, 3,200 families, and 1,250 shops.The area is being transformed into a healthy and sustainable development comprising 11 new towers, wider roads, modern infrastructure, open spaces and highly visible commercial areas. Relocated residential and commercial tenants will own their new premises at no cost to them. Due to the scope of the project the largest &quot;cluster redevelopment&quot; project in India at an estimated cost of $550 million (₹4000 crores), it has been subject to logistical and regulatory challenges, resulting in several delays.

Starting in 2010, the trust began building transit homes near Mazagaon. In 2012, the trust relocated tenants and demolished buildings it had acquired. More transit homes were built in Sion, Ghodapdeo, and Sewri. In early 2016, Mufaddal Saifuddin laid foundation for Clusters I and III. In 2020, 600 residents and 128 shop owners were relocated to the completed twin towers called Al Saadah, marking completion of the project&#x27;s first phase.

After completing the first phase of the project SBUT initiated construction work on the second phase of the project in February 2021.

Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin inaugurated the newly reconstructed Saifee Masjid and its complex on the eve of Milad al Nabi in September 2023.This complex known as Sector 1 was demolished and redeveloped with modern sustainable amenities and a commercial shopping arcade.

<text>Pedantry ( ) is an excessive concern with formalism, minor details, and rules that are not important. 

== Etymology ==
Pedantry is the adjective form of the 1580s English word pedant, which meant a male schoolteacher at the time. The word pedant originated from the French word for &quot;schoolmaster,&quot; pédant, in the 1560s, or from the Italian word for &quot;teacher, schoolmaster,&quot; pedante. Both of these words are likely an alteration of Late Latin word &quot;paedagogantem&quot;, meaning a &quot;person who trumpets minor points of learning, one who overrates learning or lays undue stress on exact knowledge of details...as compared with large matters or general principles.&quot; In ancient Greece, a paedagogus was a slave entrusted with teaching young Roman boys.

== Analysis ==
Notably, the distinction between pedantry and perfectionism is that pedantry typically focuses on highlighting trivial, unimportant details of others and is associated with the desire for attention or superiority, whereas, perfectionism typically focuses on oneself and with the desire of success and achievement. Therefore, pedantry is typically associated with more of an annoyance and ill-mannered, whereas perfectionism is associated more positively. Ultimately, pedantry could be viewed as an attempt to show superiority by appearing more intelligent, through tasks as simple as correcting a peer&#x27;s grammar online. In modern times, pedantry is also often used as an intentional tactic or unintentional act which distracts from larger issues by focusing on minor details instead. For instance, a pedant might dismiss or invalidate a comprehensive, logical argument due to a few minor grammatical errors.

&quot;Fowler&#x27;s Concise Dictionary of Modern English&quot; (1926) recognised that the term pedantry was &quot;relative&quot; and subjective, stating &quot;my pedantry is your scholarship, his reasonable accuracy, her irreducible minimum of education, and someone else’s ignorance&quot;.

<doc id="973781" wikidata="Q1444611" url="?curid=973781" title="Night-watchman state">
<text>A night-watchman state, also referred to as a minimal state or minarchy, whose proponents are known as minarchists, is a model of a state that is limited and minimal, whose functions depend on libertarian theory. Right-libertarians support it only as an enforcer of the non-aggression principle by providing citizens with the military, the police, and courts, thereby protecting them from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, and enforcing property laws.

In the United States, this form of government is mainly associated with libertarian and objectivist political philosophy. In other countries, minarchism is also advocated by some non-anarchist libertarian socialists and other left-libertarians. A night-watchman state has also been popularized by Robert Nozick in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974). The United Kingdom in the 19th century has been described by historian Charles Townshend as a standard-bearer for this form of government.

== Origin ==
As a term, &quot;night-watchman state&quot; () was coined by German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle in an 1862 speech in Berlin wherein he criticized the bourgeois-liberal limited government state, comparing it to a nightwatchman. The phrase quickly caught on as a description of capitalist government, even as liberalism began to mean a more involved state, or a state with a larger sphere of responsibility. Ludwig von Mises later opined that Lassalle tried to make limited government look ridiculous though it was no more ridiculous than governments that concerned themselves with &quot;the preparation of sauerkraut, with the manufacture of trouser buttons, or with the publication of newspapers&quot;.

Proponents of the night-watchman state are &quot;minarchists&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;minimum&quot; and &quot;-archy&quot;. &quot;Arche&quot; (; ) is a Greek word which came to mean &quot;first place, power&quot;, &quot;method of government&quot;, &quot;empire, realm&quot;, &quot;authorities&quot; (in plural: ), or &quot;command&quot;. The term &quot;minarchist&quot; was coined by Samuel Edward Konkin III in 1980.

== Philosophy ==

Right-libertarian minarchists generally justify the state as a logical consequence of the non-aggression principle. They argue that anarcho-capitalism is impractical because it is not sufficient to enforce the non-aggression principle, as the enforcement of laws under anarchy would be open to competition. Another common objection to anarchism is that private defense and court firms would tend to represent the interests of those who pay them enough.

Left-libertarian minarchists justify the state as a temporary measure on the grounds that social safety net benefits the working class. Some anarchists, such as Noam Chomsky, are in agreement with social democrats on the importance of welfare measures, but prefer using non-state methods. Left-libertarians such as Peter Hain are decentralists who do not advocate abolishing the state, but do wish to limit and devolve state power, stipulating that any measures favoring the wealthy be prioritized for repeal before those which benefit the poor.

Some minarchists argue that a state is inevitable because anarchy is futile. Robert Nozick, who publicized the idea of a minimal state in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974), argued that a night-watchman state provides a framework that allows for any political system that respects fundamental individual rights and therefore morally justifies the existence of a state.

<text>The 1st New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. It opened on 24 May 1854, following New Zealand&#x27;s first general election (held the previous year). It was dissolved on 15 September 1855 in preparation for that year&#x27;s election. 37 Members of the House of Representatives (MHRs) represented 24 electorates.

==Parliamentary sessions==
The Parliament sat for three sessions:

New Zealand had not yet obtained responsible government (that is, the power to manage its own affairs), and so the 1st Parliament did not hold any significant power.

The 1st Parliament was held before the creation of either political parties or the office of Premier. There were, however, appointments made to the Executive Council (the formal institution upon which Cabinet is based). From 14 June 1854 to 2 August 1854, there was a four-person cabinet, New Zealand&#x27;s first ministry, led by James FitzGerald, with Henry Sewell, Frederick Weld, and Thomas Bartley (a fifth member, Dillon Bell, also joined for a short time). Then, from 31 August 1854 to 2 September 1854, there was another four-person cabinet led by Thomas Forsaith, with James Macandrew, William Travers, and Jerningham Wakefield. Some historians consider FitzGerald and Forsaith to be New Zealand&#x27;s first Prime Ministers, but neither held any formal leadership role and since &quot;responsible government&quot; had not yet been obtained, they had little real power. Henry Sewell, appointed shortly after the 2nd New Zealand Parliament opened, is more often considered to have been the first Prime Minister.
On 17 August 1854 when the newly convened House of Representatives met, Administrator of the Government (acting Governor) Robert Wynyard was proposing to prorogue the General Assembly as he had not received authority from London. Sewell wanted to continue the debate and the suspension of standing orders was moved. The minority &quot;Wakefieldites&quot; (followers of Edward Gibbon Wakefield) opposed the move and tried to leave so that there would not be two-thirds of members present. This led to a violent turn when Sewell was reported to have pounced on the member for Nelson James Mackay and seized him by the throat. Suspension was moved an hour later when some members of the absent majority returned. Mackay was later found guilty of gross and premeditated contempt. There were moves to find the member from Dunedin James Macandrew guilty of contempt for entering the house with his hat on, but this was withdrawn.

The 1st Parliament consisted of thirty-seven representatives representing twenty-four electorates. Two regions of the colony (the inland regions of the lower North Island and the northwest corner of the South Island) were not part of any electorate, and so were not represented.

==Electoral boundaries for the 1st Parliament==
==Initial composition of the 1st Parliament==
==Changes during term==
There were few changes during the term of the 1st Parliament, with only three by-elections being held. There were six resignations and one death during 1855, and those seats remained vacant for the remainder of the term.

;Christchurch Country
Stuart-Wortley resigned on 18 July 1855. His seat remained vacant.

;City of Auckland
Bartley resigned on 11 July 1854. He was replaced by William Brown, who was elected on 4 August 1854.

Kelham resigned on 3 August 1855. His seat remained vacant.

;Dunedin Country
Cutten resigned on 23 July 1855. His seat remained vacant.

;Hutt
Ludlam resigned on 9 July 1855. His seat remained vacant.

;Town of Nelson &amp; Waimea
Cautley, MP for Waimea, and Travers, MP for Town of Nelson, both resigned on 26 May 1854. Travers subsequently contested the Waimea seat that Cautley had vacated, being elected on 21 June. Travers&#x27; own Nelson seat was won by Samuel Stephens on 19 June. Stephens died on 26 June 1855. His seat remained vacant.

;Wairau
Weld resigned on 13 June 1855. His seat remained vacant.

<text>Ruard Acronius (1546 in Friesland – November 1612 in Schiedam) was a Reformed theologian of the late 16th century. 

Some sources refer to Ruard Acronius as the brother of Johannes Acronius while others mention that he has been a Catholic priest at first. In 1572 he appears as Reformed preacher in Franeker. In the following, he worked for several years in Alkmaar and Bolsward. In 1599, he became preacher in Schiedam where he died late in 1612. 

He was described as an educated, but intolerant and vigorous man. For instance he challenged the Mennonites for a public debate, which indeed took place in 1596 between him and Pieter van Ceulen. After 56 long sessions both parties declared their own victory.

He took an important part in the quarrels between the Arminians and the Calvinists under Franciscus Gomarus. He helped Gomarus himself during an encounter in 1609 in The Hague. 

He tried to hinder the appearance of Jan Uytenbogaert in Bleiswijk. Uytenbogaert defending the right of the worldly leaders to decide upon ecclesiastic matters, published in 1610 a tract &quot;Tractaet van &#x27;t ambt ende Authoriteyt eener hoogher Christelicker Overheyt&quot; - countered by Acronius with the writing &quot;Noodwendig Vertoog&quot;. 

In 1610 the Remonstrants (Arminians) filed a presentation of their views at the States of Holland, the &quot;Remonstrance&quot; that gave them their name. Acronius&#x27; name is the first appearing on a counter-remonstrance filed by six delegates of the Calvinist belief.

<doc id="973790" wikidata="Q6029839" url="?curid=973790" title="Infinite conjugacy class property">
<text>In mathematics, a group is said to have the infinite conjugacy class property, or to be an ICC group, if the conjugacy class of every group element but the identity is infinite.

The von Neumann group algebra of a group is a factor if and only if the group has the infinite conjugacy class property. It will then be, provided the group is nontrivial, of type &quot;II1&quot;, i.e. it will possess a unique, faithful, tracial state.

Examples of ICC groups are the group of permutations of an infinite set that leave all but a finite subset of elements fixed, and free groups on two generators.

In abelian groups, every conjugacy class consists of only one element, so ICC groups are, in a way, as far from being abelian as possible.

<text>Pēteris Vasks (born 16 April 1946) is a Latvian composer.

==Biography==
Vasks was born in Aizpute, Latvia, into the family of a Baptist pastor. He trained as a violinist at the Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music, as a double-bass player with Vitautas Sereikaan at the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre, and played in several Latvian orchestras before entering the State Conservatory in Vilnius in the neighboring Lithuania to study composition with Valentin Utkin, as he was prevented from doing this in Latvia due to Soviet repressive policy toward Baptists. He started to become known outside Latvia in the 1990s, when Gidon Kremer started championing his works, and he now is one of the most influential and praised European contemporary composers.

Vasks&#x27; early style owed much to the aleatoric experiments of Witold Lutosławski, Krzysztof Penderecki and George Crumb. Later works included elements of Latvian folk music, such as his gentle and pastoral cor anglais concerto (1989). His works are generally extremely clear and communicative, with a solid and muscular sense of harmony. Lyrical passages may be followed by agitated dissonances, or interrupted by sombre sections with a march-like feel. He made extensive use of minimalist techniques as well, but never became attached to any particular method.

Vasks feels strongly about environmental issues, and a sense of nature both pristine and destroyed can be found in many of his works, such as the &quot;String Quartet No. 2&quot; (1984). Other important works include &quot;Cantabile&quot; (1979) and &quot;Musica dolorosa&quot; (1984) and &quot;Bass Trip&quot; (2003) for solo double bass. He has written six string quartets, the fourth (1999) and fifth (2004) of which were written for the Kronos Quartet.

Vasks was the recipient of the Vienna Herder Prize of the Alfred Toepfer Foundation in 1996, as well as the Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science, and the Latvian Grand Music Award in 1997, the latter for his first violin concerto &quot;Tālā gaismā&quot; (&quot;Distant Light&quot;) (1996–97). He received the Cannes Classical Awards in 2004. His important works also include &quot;Viatore&quot;, Symphony No. 2 and &quot;Music for a deceased Friend&quot;.

Since 1994 he has been an honorary member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences and in 2001 he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. In 1996 he was the main composer at the Stockholm New Music Festival and in 2006 composer-in-residence at the Presteigne Festival of Music and the Arts and the Vale of Glamorgan Festival in Wales.

In 2005 he received the Estonian honour the Order of the White Star, 3rd Class.

<text>Baja () is a city with county rights in , southern Hungary. It is the second largest city in the county, after the county seat at Kecskemét, and is home to some 35,000 people. Baja is the seat of the Baja municipality.

The environs of Baja have been continuously inhabited since the end of the Iron Age, but there is evidence of human presence since prehistoric times. The settlement itself was most likely established in the 14th century. After the Ottoman Empire had conquered Hungary, it grew to prominence more than the other nearby settlements, and was granted town rights in 1696.

Today, Baja plays an important role in the life of Northern Bácska as a local commercial centre and the provider of public services such as education and healthcare. It has several roads and a railway connection to other parts of the country, and also offers local Public transport for its residents. Being close to the Danube and the forest of Gemenc, as well as having its own cultural sights, makes it a candidate for tourism, but this is not well established yet.

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s Hungarian name is probably derived from a Turkic language. The commonly known &quot;bull&quot; name is likely not its real origin, but may have gotten its title from the first owner of the city, Baja. The Latin name of the town is &quot;Francillo&quot;. Baja also used to have a German name: &quot;Frankenstadt&quot;.

The South Slavs, Bunjevci and Serbs, who live in the city call Baja by the same name as Magyars do, but with a slightly different pronunciation ( instead of ). Its spelling in Serbian Cyrillic writing is Баја.

==History==
The city was first mentioned in 1308. The Bajai family was the first known owner of the town. In 1474 the settlement was given to the Czobor family by Matthias Corvinus.

During the Turkish Conquest in the 16th and 17th centuries it was the official center for the region and it possessed a fortification. This era saw the immigration of Bunjevci and Serbs into the town. There was also an active Franciscan mission with monks from Bosnia. 
In the 18th century, Hungary with its regained territories was a part of the Habsburg Empire. Germans, Hungarians and Jews migrated into the town. Due to its location on the Danube, it became a transportation and commercial hub for the region. This was the place where grain and wine were loaded onto boats to be transported upriver to Austria and Germany. In 1727 the Czobor family regained its ownership. Until 1765, the inhabitants belonged to three nations; Bunjevac (under name of &quot;Dalmatians&quot;), the Germans and the Serbs. Following this, according to a government decree the &quot;Natio Dalmatica&quot; was changed into the &quot;Natio Hungarica&quot;, but even in 1768, the elected mayor swore the oath in the Bunjevac language in the Franciscan Church.

In 1699, Baja was Bács-Bodrog county&#x27;s most &quot;industrialized&quot; city.

In the 19th century Baja became a minor railway hub, but its importance declined as the railway to Fiume (Rijeka) was built in order to get Hungarian grain seaborne. The city was still a commercial and service center for the region.

In 1918, after World War I, the ceasefire line placed the city under administration of the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. By the Treaty of Trianon from 1920, the city was assigned to Hungary, and became the capital of the reduced county of .

After World War II the city became known for its textile mill and because of its important bridge crossing the Danube. Its importance is still evident as people from the Bácska region (Serbian: Bačka) of Hungary come for higher education, government and business services.

===Historical population===

The city&#x27;s population was growing rapidly in the 20th century (especially in the interwar period and during the socialist era), but in the last decade its population declined significantly.

The demographic evolution of Baja is the following:

==Geography==
===Location===
Baja is located about south of Budapest and southwest of Kecskemét, at the crossing of Road 55 and Road 51, on the river Danube. Baja&#x27;s main river is Sugovica (also called &quot;Kamarás-Duna&quot;).&lt;br&gt;
Baja is at the meeting point of two large regions: the Great Hungarian Plain (Alföld) and Transdanubia (Dunántúl). The River Danube separates the two regions. The occidental part of the city is where the Gemencforest starts to spread out next to the &quot;István Türr Bridge&quot;. Gemenc is part of the Danube-Drava National Park. It can be discovered from Baja via a narrow gauge railway.&lt;br&gt;
Baja is located on the left bank of the river, on the Great Hungarian Plain. However, Baja is more similar to the cities of Transdanubia. To the east, arable crops such as maize, wheat and barley are grown.

===Climate===
Baja is at the meeting of the continental and mediterranean region of Hungary. The summers are hot (the temperature sometimes goes up to 36–37 °C) and stifling, while the winters are cold and snowy. It often rains in the spring. At summertime extreme torrential rains are getting common every now and then in the region.

==Economy==
The city plays an important role in the country&#x27;s water transport on the river Danube with its second biggest port in Hungary. Baja gives home to an extensive corporation: to AXIÁL Co. Axiál sells agricultural machines all over eastern Europe with great success. Gemenc Forest and Game Co. Ltd. is managing the nearby nature reserve, Gemenc. There are numerous commercial structures in the city, which prove important to the people living in and around Baja. Roughly 10 years ago a TESCO supermarket opened along with a shopping centre next to it.

==Culture, education, and life==

The city has some museums and art galleries, most of them with permanent exhibitions. These include the &quot;István Türr Museum&quot; (exhibits objects of former local life), the &quot;István Nagy Gallery&quot; (a collection of István Nagy&#x27;s paintings), and the &quot;Bunjevci House&quot; (about Bunjevci traditions). The annual &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Soup Boiling Festival&quot; is a famous event in Europe, which includes a great fish soup boiling contest, and other cultural occurrences.
There are 15 churches in the city, representing the religion of each ethnicity. These religions include (with the number of believers) Roman Catholic (25 203), Protestant (1 623), Evangelist (268), Unitarian, Orthodox (90), Lutheran and Judaism (27).
Located relatively close to the Great Hungarian Plain, to Gemenc and Transdanubia, the city is also feasible as a base for regional tourists.

There are three notable educational institutes in the city: Béla III High school and the Eötvös József College. A smaller observatory also exists. There is the MNÁMK (Magyarországi Németek Általános Művelődési Központja; English: &quot;General Culture Center of Germans Living in Hungary&quot;).

===Endre Ady Library===
Baja&#x27;s library got its name from the famous Hungarian poet, Endre Ady. The library&#x27;s building used to be Baja&#x27;s synagogue. The building was offered by the city&#x27;s Jewish community. The Holocaust appreciation memorial stands in the synagogue&#x27;s garden.

The library has a very large collection of pre-18th-century books. The &quot;Ancient book&quot; collection includes 4,352 volumes, and a lot more writings, because many of the volumes are collectives (for example, one of them contains 17 writings). The library has three incunabulums.

<text>The Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Department (RAChD) is an all-officer department that provides ordained clergy to minister to the British Army.

==History==
The Army Chaplains&#x27; Department (AChD) was formed by Royal Warrant of 23 September 1796; until then chaplains had been part of individual regiments, but not on the central establishment. Only Anglican chaplains were recruited until 1827, when Presbyterians were recognised, but not commissioned until 1858. Roman Catholic chaplains were recruited from 1836, Methodist chaplains from 1881, and Jewish chaplains from 1892. During the First World War some 4,400 Army Chaplains were recruited and 179 lost their lives on active service. The department received the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix in February 1919. During the Second World War another 96 British and 38 Commonwealth Army Chaplains lost their lives.

From 1946 to 1996, the RAChD&#x27;s Headquarters, Depot and Training Centre were at Bagshot Park in Surrey, now the home of The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. In 1996, they moved to the joint service Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre at Amport House near Andover, Hampshire. Since 2020 the joint centre has been based at Beckett House, part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, just outside Shrivenham, Oxfordshire. In November 2023, the Ministry of Defence announced the intent to recruit Non-Religious Pastoral Support Officers into chaplaincy in order to reflect the changing demographics of the United Kingdom and HM Forces.

== Selection and training ==
Candidates, both regular and reserve, first make a familiarisation visit to meet serving chaplains at an Army camp. They proceed to the Army Officer Selection Board at Leighton House, Westbury, for physical and mental assessment. Successful candidates receive initial training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre, Beckett House, Shrivenham and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

Candidates for chaplain to the Army Cadet Force are interviewed by the Regional Senior Chaplain, then attend a regional Army Cadets Commissions Board. Successful candidates undergo familiarisation, followed by initial training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre.

==Role==
Serving regular chaplains in the British Army can be Catholic, one of several Protestant denominations, or to the Jewish faith. Uniquely within the Army, the Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Department has different cap badges for its Christian and Jewish officers.

Army chaplains, although they are all commissioned officers of the British Army and wear uniform, do not have executive authority. They are unique within the Army in that they do not carry arms. Many chaplains have been decorated for bravery in action, including four awarded Victoria Crosses: James Adams, Noel Mellish, Theodore Hardy and William Addison. At services on formal occasions, chaplains wear their medals and decorations on their clerical robes.

The RAChD&#x27;s motto is &quot;In this Sign Conquer&quot; as seen in the sky before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge by the Roman Emperor Constantine. Its regimental march, both quick and slow, is the &quot;Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March&quot;, erroneously known as the &quot;Trumpet Voluntary&quot;.

==Museum==
The Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Museum is at Shrivenham, in a new building opened by the Countess of Wessex on 17 May 2022. Its newly curated collection replaced the Museum of Army Chaplaincy which was at Amport House near Andover, Hampshire until 2019.

==Faith denominations and belief backgrounds==
Chaplains are either classified as Jewish, a member of one of the following denominational Christian groups, a member of World Faiths or a Non-religious Pastoral Provider:
*Anglican (Church of England, Church of Ireland, Church in Wales and Scottish Episcopal Church)
*Assemblies of God
*Baptist Union of Great Britain 
*Buddhist
*Church of Scotland 
*Free Church of Scotland
*Churches in Communities International
*Congregational Federation
*Elim Pentecostal Church
*Hindu
*Methodist Church
*Muslim
*Presbyterian Church in Ireland
*Roman Catholic Church
*United Reformed Church
*Salvation Army
*Sikh faith

There are also religious advisors from other faiths.

An Army chaplain is expected to minister to and provide pastoral care to any soldier who needs it, no matter their denomination or faith or lack of it.

In 2004, Defence Minister Ivor Caplin said: “It is our aspiration to have armed forces which are representative of UK society as a whole.” The move might also help when dealing with soldiers in other armies from different faiths. At the time there were about 740 personnel that declared themselves to be from the four other main religions, but only Christian chaplains are employed by the Ministry of Defence. The number of non religious Ministry of Defence personnel including those in uniform numbered in the tens of thousands.

In 2011, following a freedom of information request on Ministry of Defence spending on chaplaincy, the National Secular Society proposed that £22m of spending should come directly from churches while professional counselling should continue to be funded by the taxpayer, in order to better serve the non-religious in the military. The proposal was rejected by the Church of England.

In September 2021, Defence Humanists, through a submission to the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign policy, defence, security and international development, called for an independent review of pastoral support for the armed forces which takes into account the nation’s changing religion and belief demographics and the need for a multi-faith and belief approach. In November 2023, the Ministry of Defence announced the intent to recruit Non-Religious Pastoral Support Officers into chaplaincy in order to reflect the changing demographics of the United Kingdom and HM Forces. The armed forces of the Netherlands have had Humanist chaplains since 1964, known as Humanist Counseling in the Dutch Armed Forces.

==Ranks==

Chaplains are the only British Army officers who do not carry standard officer ranks. They are instead designated Chaplain to the Forces (CF) (e.g. &quot;The Reverend John Smith CF&quot;). They do, however, have grades which equate to the standard ranks and wear the insignia of the equivalent rank. Chaplains are usually addressed as &quot;Padre&quot; , never by their nominal military rank.

*Chaplain-General (CG) = Major-General
*Deputy Chaplain-General (DCG) = Brigadier
*Chaplain to the Forces 1st Class (CF1) = Colonel
*Chaplain to the Forces 2nd Class (CF2) = Lieutenant-Colonel
*Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (CF3) = Major
*Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (CF4) = Captain

The senior Church of England chaplain is ranked within the church hierarchy as an archdeacon, and he or she holds the appointment of Archdeacon for the Army whether or not he or she is also the Chaplain-General. The senior Roman Catholic Chaplain (usually a CF1) is sometimes ranked as a monsignor.

<text>Selborne is a village in Hampshire, England, south of Alton, and just within the northern boundary of the South Downs National Park. The village receives visitors because of its links with the naturalist Revd. Gilbert White, a pioneer of birdwatching.

==The village==
St Mary the Virgin is a Grade I listed church that dates back to the late 12th century. There is a primary school, and one public house the &quot;Selborne Arms&quot;. A bus service that runs through the village links it to Alton and Petersfield.

At the back of the village, behind the Selborne Arms and Gilbert White&#x27;s Field Studies Centre, there is the &quot;Zig-Zag Path&quot;, which was cut into the hillside in the 1760s by Gilbert White and his brother John, to provide easier access to the Hanger and Selborne Common on the summit of Selborne Hill.

A complete history of Selborne, from its geology through its establishment as a settlement in the Dark Ages to the present day, including a study of local architecture, was locally published in March 2009: &quot;Knights, Priests &amp; Peasants&quot; was written by Dr. Edward Yates, a retired academic polymath and long-time resident of the village. Its 400 pages include oral histories from the turn of the 19th/20th centuries.

==Gilbert White==

Selborne is famous for its association with the 18th-century naturalist Gilbert White (1720–1793), who lived at &quot;The Wakes&quot; and wrote &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;. Tourism helps to support the local pub, shops and cafes, which the resident population alone would make unviable. Many people combine their visit with one to Jane Austen’s house in nearby Chawton.

First published in 1789 by Benjamin White (Gilbert&#x27;s brother), the book has not been out of print in over 200 years. White is recognised as being the first ecologist or environmentalist. Most of his observations on wildlife remain pertinent, although he did have some strange theories. Most notorious is his belief that not all swallows, martins and swifts migrate, but that some might hibernate instead, although he mocked the peculiar Swedish notion that swallows spent the winter beneath the surface of the local ponds. White was writing before seasonal migration was fully understood. However, White was the first person to discover that swifts mate on the wing.

&quot;The Wakes&quot; was subsequently home to Thomas Bell, FRS, who moved there after retirement circa 1862, studied White&#x27;s work, and edited a new edition of &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;.

The 1957 British Transport Films documentary &quot;Journey into Spring&quot;, directed by Ralph Keene, is a tribute to White and portrays the arrival of spring in Selborne.

===Museum and Field Studies Centre===

&quot;The Wakes&quot; has been converted into a museum, known as Gilbert White&#x27;s house. This museum also contains the Oates Museum and family archive. This comprises an exhibition relating to the life of Captain Lawrence Oates, who died on Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s ill-fated expedition to Antarctica in the early 20th century, and Frank Oates, his uncle. Frank Oates was an explorer and naturalist, who mounted expeditions in the late 19th century into Central America and Africa.

In 2002 the Gilbert White Field Studies Centre moved into new premises, a restored and extended 16th-century Hampshire barn, which had been moved from Weston Patrick near Basingstoke and re-erected in the parkland of Gilbert White&#x27;s home. This was achieved with financial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Hampshire County Council. It was officially opened by Prince Charles on 10 July 2002.

Selborne is still a good base for birdwatching, although White observed some species in the area which are no longer to be found. An example of a bird which disappeared is the great bustard, which became extinct in Britain in the 19th century but is now the subject of a reintroduction project.

&quot;The Wakes&quot; was substantially refurbished and updated in 2003–04. The costs of £1.3m were covered by a combination of personal, institutional and charity grants amounting to 50% of the total, matched by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. It is open throughout the year, attracting an annual average of 30,000 visitors. The Museum and Field Study Centre is a registered charity.

==Local business==
Selborne Pottery, established in 1985, manufactures and sells a range of hand thrown and decorated stoneware pottery using rich copper red and cobalt blue glazes. Each piece of pottery is hand thrown and turned on a wheel; no industrial techniques or moulds are used in the making process. The pottery has a shop in the village.

Selborne Biological Services, formed in 1974 on a farm in Selborne, makes animal-derived products for the biotech, pharmaceutical, veterinary, and diagnostics industries. They moved their main production facilities to Tasmania in 1992 following the BSE outbreak in the UK in the late 1980s, but maintain a European sales, marketing and distribution centre in Selborne.

=== Former businesses ===
Tower Brick &amp; Tile Company Limited produced handmade Selborne bricks and roof tiles at their site near Selborne from 1872 until the company went into administration in 2009.

Selborne Gallery was the only art gallery in Britain devoted entirely to the work of mouth and foot painting artists. Formed in 1992, it was visited by Prince Charles on its tenth anniversary in 2002. The displayed work included painting, printmaking, drawing, textiles, ceramics, glass and jewellery.

==Transport==
The village is on the B3006; and is served by the 38 and 37X bus routes. The nearest railway station is Alton, north of the village. Liss is a little further away to the east, with frequent trains on the Portsmouth-Waterloo line.

<doc id="973828" wikidata="Q7310823" url="?curid=973828" title="Relativistic Euler equations">
<text>In fluid mechanics and astrophysics, the relativistic Euler equations are a generalization of the Euler equations that account for the effects of general relativity. They have applications in high-energy astrophysics and numerical relativity, where they are commonly used for describing phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts, accretion phenomena, and neutron stars, often with the addition of a magnetic field. &quot;Note: for consistency with the literature, this article makes use of natural units, namely the speed of light&quot; formula_1 &quot;and the Einstein summation convention.&quot;

== Motivation ==
For most fluids observable on Earth, traditional fluid mechanics based on Newtonian mechanics is sufficient. However, as the fluid velocity approaches the speed of light or moves through strong gravitational fields, or the pressure approaches the energy density (formula_2), these equations are no longer valid. Such situations occur frequently in astrophysical applications. For example, gamma-ray bursts often feature speeds only formula_3 less than the speed of light, and neutron stars feature gravitational fields that are more than formula_4 times stronger than the Earth&#x27;s. Under these extreme circumstances, only a relativistic treatment of fluids will suffice.

== Introduction ==
The equations of motion are contained in the continuity equation of the stress–energy tensor formula_5:

formula_6

where formula_7 is the covariant derivative. For a perfect fluid,

formula_8

Here formula_9 is the total mass-energy density (including both rest mass and internal energy density) of the fluid, formula_10 is the fluid pressure, formula_11 is the four-velocity of the fluid, and formula_12 is the metric tensor. To the above equations, a statement of conservation is usually added, usually conservation of baryon number. If formula_13 is the number density of baryons this may be stated

formula_14

These equations reduce to the classical Euler equations if the fluid three-velocity is much less than the speed of light, the pressure is much less than the energy density, and the latter is dominated by the rest mass density. To close this system, an equation of state, such as an ideal gas or a Fermi gas, is also added.

==Equations of motion in flat space==
In the case of flat space, that is formula_15 and using a metric signature of formula_16, the equations of motion are,
formula_17

Where formula_18 is the energy density of the system, with formula_10 being the pressure, and formula_20 being the four-velocity of the system.

Expanding out the sums and equations, we have, (using formula_21 as the material derivative)
formula_22

Then, picking formula_23 to observe the behavior of the velocity itself, we see that the equations of motion become
formula_24

Note that taking the non-relativistic limit, we have formula_25. This says that the energy of the fluid is dominated by its rest energy.

In this limit, we have formula_26 and formula_27, and can see that we return the Euler Equation of formula_28.

===Derivation===
In order to determine the equations of motion, we take advantage of the following spatial projection tensor condition:
formula_29

We prove this by looking at formula_30 and then multiplying each side by formula_31. Upon doing this, and noting that formula_32, we have formula_33. Relabeling the indices formula_34 as formula_35 shows that the two completely cancel. This cancellation is the expected result of contracting a temporal tensor with a spatial tensor.

Now, when we note that
formula_36

where we have implicitly defined that formula_37, we can calculate that
formula_38

and thus
formula_39

Then, let&#x27;s note the fact that formula_40 and formula_41. Note that the second identity follows from the first. Under these simplifications, we find that
formula_42

and thus by formula_43, we have
formula_44

We have two cancellations, and are thus left with
formula_45

<text>Village Roadshow Pty Limited is an Australian company which operates cinemas and theme parks, and produces and distributes films. Before being acquired by private equity company BGH Capital, the company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and majority owned by Village Roadshow Corporation, with members of founder Roc Kirby&#x27;s family in the top roles.

==History==
Village Roadshow originally started operations as Village Drive-Ins (later known as &quot;Village Drive-ins and Cinemas&quot; before becoming today&#x27;s &quot;Village Cinemas&quot; brand), in 1954, when founder Roc Kirby began running one of Australia&#x27;s first drive-in cinemas in the Melbourne suburb of Croydon. The drive-in was adjacent to a shopping strip called &quot;Croydon Village&quot;; hence the company adopted the &quot;Village&quot; name. The company later expanded into traditional cinemas in major areas, though it still operates the &quot;Coburg Drive-In&quot; in Coburg, Melbourne.

In 1968, the company expanded to start its film distribution business with Roadshow (once a 50-50 joint venture with Greater Union) and moved into film production in 1971 with the establishment of Hexagon Productions, and the company expanding into a longstanding relationship with Warner Bros. to distribute films in the Australian market. The original cinema chain now became one of several businesses the company was involved in.

In the 1980s, Village Roadshow was one of the leading forces in creating state of the art multiplex cinema complexes. Innovations brought in during this period included using stadium-style seating, sophisticated sound systems and the latest in projection technologies. The cinemas of that era were the forerunners to the multiplexes of today. It was expanded in 1987 when it signed a partnership with rival cinema chain Greater Union to see 200 screens expanded to their circuits by 1990 and having both companies to develop $100 million in their equipment.

The venture was expanded in September 1987 when Roadshow and Greater Union agreed to combine the existing Roadshow Distributors theatrical branch with Greater Union&#x27;s own theatrical branch, Greater Union Film Distributors to set up new separate-branding labels, Roadshow Greater Union Distributors and Greater Union Distributors, and RGUD continue to handle the existing suppliers, which included Warner Bros, Orion Pictures and New World Pictures.

In 1988, Village Roadshow took over De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, which brought on a change of name: Village Roadshow Limited. This allowed the company to raise more capital to fund further expansion.

In the 1990s, the company diversified into complementary media and entertainment businesses. This included the purchase and development of theme parks, the purchase and integration of the Triple M and Today radio networks to create Austereo, the creation of Roadshow Music, the creation of Village Roadshow Pictures, and the commencement of a co-production deal with Warner Bros.

Village Roadshow has scaled back its international cinema markets to Australia and Singapore. The company merged its Village Roadshow Pictures arm with Concord Music Group to form a Los Angeles-based diversified entertainment division, Village Roadshow Entertainment Group.

In 2003, the company formed a joint venture, Australian Theatres, with Amalgamated Holdings Limited, owners of Greater Union and several other cinema brands. The original founding business, Village Cinemas, is part of the joint venture.

In 2008, Village Roadshow and Concord Music Group, co-owned by television producer Norman Lear, said they had completed a merger, forming a new company to exploit their film and music assets. Investors in the new company included Michael Lambert and private equity firms Tailwind Capital Partners and Clarity Partners. Then, on March 25, 2013, a Wood Creek Capital led investor group purchased Concord Music Group from Village Roadshow Entertainment Group.

In late 2019, company veteran Graham Burke stepped down as CEO and became a non-executive director, with Clark Kirby his successor as CEO.

In 2020, Village Roadshow entered talks with private equity firm BGH Capital about a takeover. The offer was lowered after the COVID-19 pandemic closed theme parks and cinemas, and shareholders voted to accept it in December 2020. In 2022, Antenna Group announced that it was to acquire the Greek cinema chains from Village Roadshow Operations.

In 2023, Village Roadshow renamed their company from Village Roadshow Limited to Village Roadshow Pty Limited, due to them no longer being listed on the ASX.

<text>The Europa Press was a publishing house founded and run by the Irish surrealist poet George Reavey. The press was based in Paris from its inception in 1932 until 1935, when Reavey moved to London. It ceased operation in 1939.

The Europa Press is important in the history of 20th century Irish poetry because it published early work by Reavey, Brian Coffey, Denis Devlin and Samuel Beckett and in a wider context of literary and surrealist history because it published the first ever collection of English-language versions of work by Paul Éluard. This was published to coincide with the opening of the International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936 and featured a drawing by Pablo Picasso and a preface by Herbert Read, and the translators included Reavey, Beckett, Devlin, David Gascoyne, Man Ray and Ruthven Todd.

<text>Longpigs were an English indie rock band who rose to fame on the fringe of Britpop in the 1990s, comprising Crispin Hunt (vocals), Richard Hawley (guitar), Simon Stafford (bass guitar) and former Cabaret Voltaire member Dee Boyle (drums), who was replaced by Andy Cook for their second album. Hailing from Sheffield, the group had success with singles such as &quot;She Said&quot; and &quot;On and On&quot;, and their well-received debut album, &quot;The Sun Is Often Out&quot; (1996).

==History==
===Early career (1993)===
The group initially signed with Elektra Records, but just before the release of their first single, two major crises struck the band: Lead singer Hunt was seriously injured in a car accident, resulting in his being in a coma for three days. Then, shortly afterwards, the UK arm of the record label closed, leaving the Longpigs&#x27; future in doubt. Elektra set a price of £500,000 to release them from their recording contract.

===The first success (1994–1996)===
The Longpigs&#x27; contract was purchased by U2&#x27;s new record label, Mother Records. The band toured extensively, opening for Echobelly, Supergrass and finally Radiohead in early 1995. Their first singles on Mother Records, &quot;Happy Again&quot;, &quot;She Said&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, did little in the charts. The band played the 1995 Reading Festival. The new track &quot;All Hype&quot; was featured on the compilation CD &quot;Volume 14: Reading &#x27;95 Special&quot; although was never released as a single.

Their fourth single, &quot;Far&quot;, hit the UK Top 40. In March 1996 this was followed by the ballad &quot;On and On&quot;, which received considerable radio airplay and hit the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. In April 1996 the band released their debut album, &quot;The Sun Is Often Out&quot;, which was declared one of 1996&#x27;s 50 best albums by both &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. On the heels of their newfound success, the band repackaged and re-released &quot;She Said&quot;, which also reached the UK Top 20 in June 1996, which was followed by &quot;Lost Myself&quot; (#22).

===Attempted popularity in America (1997)===
Initially things seemed promising in America. In 1997, their single &quot;On and On&quot; was added to the playlist of the influential Los Angeles, California alternative radio station KROQ-FM, briefly reaching the Alternative U.S. Top 10. The song was also featured on the &quot;&quot; (although it was not used in the film). They toured America with Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Dandy Warhols, and even opened for U2 on several dates of their PopMart world tour. This tour featured a new track, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, which was never officially released. The band also played the 1997 Glastonbury Festival, with the live track &quot;Travel&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Far&quot; B-side &quot;Amateur Dramatics&quot;) being featured on the official BBC live Glastonbury compilation &quot;Mud for It&quot;.
The song &quot;On and On&quot; can be found on the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Face&quot; starring Robert Carlyle.

===Decline and split (1999–2000)===
Before the recording of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Mobile Home&quot;, Dee Boyle left the band and was replaced by Andy Cook. Boyle&#x27;s relationship with the band resulted in later conflicts with the members.
&quot;Mobile Home&quot; was released in October 1999, along with the two singles &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and &quot;The Frank Sonata&quot;. After briefly reaching the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, sales of the album faded away. Mother Records folded in 2000, and the rest of the band split up shortly afterwards.

==Aftermath and other projects==
Following the break-up of the band, guitarist Richard Hawley toured with Pulp, before embarking upon a successful solo career and also working with Jarvis Cocker in the electro group Relaxed Muscle. Hawley&#x27;s fourth and seventh solo albums, &quot;Coles Corner&quot; and &quot;Standing at the Sky&#x27;s Edge&quot;, were nominated for the Mercury Prize, although each lost out, to fellow Sheffield band Arctic Monkeys and art rock band Alt-J respectively.

Simon Stafford has also played as part of Cocker&#x27;s backing band on his solo endeavours. He played in Hawley&#x27;s band for a year and went on to join Joe Strummer&#x27;s band The Mescaleros, playing with them until Strummer&#x27;s death in 2002. He then played with Jarvis Cocker and various other bands, playing various instruments. He now plays keyboards and trombone with Liverpool-based heavy-psych rockers The Bonnacons of Doom on Rocket Records.

In 2004, Hunt lent his voice to the self-titled album by electronic band Mayonnaise, which also featured Howie B, on the Lunaticworks/BMG label. The following year Hunt joined a band called Gramercy, with Nigel Hoyle (exGay Dad) and Dylan Rippon. In August 2005 the band recorded a single entitled &quot;Hold On&quot; (Redemption Records), which had begun to pick up airplay on BBC Radio 2 when the band split before releasing any material.

Hunt has also worked as a songwriter and record producer for Ellie Goulding, Penguin Prison, Midnight Lion, Florence and the Machine, Newton Faulkner, Kiko Bun, Natalie Imbruglia, Gabriella Cilmi, Lisa Mitchell, Lissie, Richard Walters, Josephine Oniyama, Clare Maguire, Liam Frost, Ron Sexsmith, Kate Walsh, Jake Bugg, Misty Miller, Eliza and the Bear and JP Cooper.

In 2013, a compilation album &quot;On and On: The Anthology&quot; was released, featuring material from the Longpigs&#x27; two studio albums, singles&#x27; B-sides and previously unreleased material.

In April 2017, it was reported that Dee Boyle, the band&#x27;s former drummer, had died. He was 52 years old. The cause of death was unknown.

In April 2019, Hunt was announced as an MEP candidate for the newly formed Change UK - The Independent Group (TIG) political party for the 2019 European Parliament election. He was not elected.

<doc id="973851" wikidata="Q2603794" url="?curid=973851" title="Kenshi (Mortal Kombat)">
<text>Kenshi Takahashi is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He makes his series debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002) as a blind swordsman and Special Forces operative. In addition to his sword skills, he possesses telekinetic abilities.

Outside of the games, Kenshi has appeared in various related media, including comic books and the 2011 web series &quot;Mortal Kombat Legacy&quot;, and is featured in the 2022 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot;. While Kenshi is regarded as the best fighter from the series&#x27; three-dimensional era and one of the few characters to successfully transition to the return of the two-dimensional series of games, he has received some criticism as a perceived representation of disability and cultural tropes in video gaming.

==Design and gameplay==
In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; character designer Allen Ditzig&#x27;s early concept sketches, the character was called &quot;the Kenshi&quot; (&quot;swordsman&quot;) and described as a &quot;spirit hunter&quot;. During production, Kenshi was originally named &quot;Blind Gi&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Blind Kenshi&quot; before his final name was determined. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator Ed Boon said that he had included Kenshi in the 2011 reboot game because he and many of the series developers were fans of the character. For &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, designer Solomon Gaitan took inspiration from samurai and ninja in designing Kenshi&#x27;s armor, and &quot;tried to keep it more ninja-esque&quot; with a slimmer shape &quot;because too much samurai would be clunky and odd looking.&quot; The character&#x27;s final digital sculpt was completed in a week with some changes made by NetherRealm Studios&#x27; art department, as &quot;what works in concept art doesn&#x27;t always hold up well in 3D.&quot;

Kenshi was intended to replace Ermac as the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&#x27; character that utilized psychokinetic abilities. A physical weapon was added for him to channel his powers into, which Boon explained was done to compensate for his blindness and make him one of the &quot;strongest&quot; characters in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;. Mark Ryan Sallee of &quot;GameSpy&quot; described Kenshi&#x27;s special moves in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; as similar to Ermac&#x27;s but &quot;not as comboable&quot; while citing his sword attacks as his most potent in the game. According to the site&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon&quot; walkthrough, Kenshi is a midrange attacker whose special moves are best utilized at that distance, as anything closer makes him &quot;vulnerable to counterattacks.&quot; Kenshi&#x27;s offense includes creating a temporary psychic image that attacks opponents, first a clone of himself in the 2011 reboot, a demon in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, and an &quot;ancestral&quot; spirit in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;.

Kenshi has been cited as a difficult character to play in the series&#x27; recent installments. In &quot;MKX&quot;, his playstyle is split into three variations like the other characters, and Bryan Dawson of Prima Games described him as &quot;requir[ing] some patience to play&quot; and who &quot;relies heavily on keeping his opponents at a distance and only closing in when necessary.&quot; Kai Adler of &quot;GameRant&quot; commented that while Kenshi could &quot;dish out incredible damage,&quot; he was among &quot;MK1&quot;″s most difficult characters to play &quot;as his moves are very unfamiliar to the rest of the roster&quot;, and it was &quot;up to the player to decide whether they want to follow a path that will require much time and practice dedicated to a single character.&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
A born fighter, Kenshi Takahashi wandered Earth in search of worthy competition, defeating opponents to boost his pride. In the process, he encounters a man named Song, who leads him to Sento, a powerful ancient sword. Upon locating it and opening its tomb, a concentration of imprisoned souls inside it blinds Kenshi while &quot;Song&quot; reveals himself the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung, who absorbs the souls and leaves Kenshi for dead. After the sword telepathically guides him out of the tomb, Kenshi re-dedicates himself towards retraining his senses and searching for Shang Tsung.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Kenshi is recruited into the Special Forces to help find missing member Cyrax in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld. During his search, Kenshi encounters Ermac, an enforcer of evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. Pitying him, Kenshi frees Ermac from Shao&#x27;s control. In return, Ermac hones Kenshi&#x27;s telekinetic power. Kenshi resumes his hunt for Shang Tsung, but is thwarted by the Red Dragon clan, who destroy the Special Forces headquarters and send Mavado to kill Kenshi. Despite defeating him however, Mavado leaves him for dead.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), Kenshi allies himself with Sub-Zero after the ninja nurses him back to health. As they attempt to return to Earth, they clash with Hotaru, a neutral but strict guardsman from the realm of Seido who pledged his loyalty to the Dragon King Onaga and has been pursuing Sub-Zero.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), Kenshi takes part in the battle for the elemental Blaze&#x27;s power. With Shang Tsung believed killed by Onaga, Kenshi ends his revenge and returns to Earth, where he eliminates several criminal organizations before joining a group led by Johnny Cage in their battle against the fallen Elder God Shinnok.

Kenshi appears as a downloadable playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), which included his in-game biography from &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Kenshi serves as a consultant to a Special Forces unit, and entered a relationship with a Thai-American woman named Suchin. Together, they had a son named Takeda Takahashi. However, she was killed by the Red Dragon clan in their pursuit of Kenshi, which leads him to leave Takeda in the care of Hanzo Hasashi for training and the youth&#x27;s protection. Twenty years later, Kenshi and Takeda reunite, though their relationship is briefly strained due to the former&#x27;s absence before they later reconcile.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), following changes to the timeline made by Fire God Liu Kang, Kenshi is a former yakuza member and descendant of the Taira clan who seeks to reclaim the clan&#x27;s lost sword, Sento, to free them from the yakuza. In pursuit of his quest, Kenshi comes into conflict with actor Johnny Cage, who owns the sword as a memento. They are both recruited by Liu Kang to represent Earthrealm in the Mortal Kombat tournament. After Raiden is chosen as Liu Kang&#x27;s champion, Kenshi, Cage, and Kung Lao are tasked with capturing Shang Tsung. In the midst of this, they unknowingly botch Shang Tsung&#x27;s efforts to treat Princess Mileena&#x27;s Tarkat disease, leading to her going on a rampage. Amidst this, Kenshi rescues Cage from her, but loses his eyes in the attack before Shang Tsung stops her. In return, Cage eventually gives Sento back to Kenshi before the pair assist Liu Kang saving Earthrealm and Outworld from Shang Tsung. Following this, Kenshi turns his attention back to reviving his clan and helping his cousin Takeda leave the yakuza as well.

===Other media===
Kenshi appears in the second season of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; (2013), portrayed by martial artist Dan Southworth. Initially unaccustomed to wearing a blindfold, he stated that there were &quot;moments where I was just swinging my arms out and was hoping that it connected in the right place, or not.&quot; This version of Kenshi is initially a &quot;rōnin&quot; from feudal Japan. After rescuing an old traveler from bandits, the former informs Kenshi of the &quot;sword of Sento&quot;, which was crafted by Shao Kahn and guarded by the demonic Ermac. While Kenshi eventually succeeds in obtaining the weapon, he is blinded by Ermac, who later fights him in the Mortal Kombat tournament to reclaim Sento, only to be killed by Kenshi.

Kenshi appears in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat X: Blood Ties&quot; #1, which expands on Kenshi&#x27;s decision to leave Takeda in Hanzo Hasashi&#x27;s care.

A younger Kenshi from a post-apocalyptic future is the main protagonist in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind&quot; (2022), voiced by Manny Jacinto. After being blinded by Shang Tsung, Kenshi seeks out an aged Sub-Zero to defeat Kano&#x27;s Black Dragon clan.

==Reception==
Kenshi is regarded as one of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&#x27; top characters by several gaming media outlets. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; lauded Kenshi as &quot;the best design to come out past the original [series] trilogy&quot; with &quot;a look that feels like Solid Snake mixed with Daredevil,&quot; and, despite his friendships with Sub-Zero and Scorpion in past games, &quot;far from a Mary Sue character. [He] canonically gets his ass handed to him by Mavado [in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;] and spends the next game healing from his injuries.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Marcus Stewart wrote that Kenshi&#x27;s design and gameplay made him &quot;one of the few post-&quot;MK4&quot; characters that feels like he belongs with the classic roster.&quot; According to Jason Wojnar of &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, &quot;The series had a hard time introducing new characters that stuck once it transitioned into three dimensions. Kenshi, however, wooed fans from the start with his look and interesting backstory [and] has quickly become a series mainstay&quot;. Kevin Wong of &quot;Complex&quot; rated &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; as one of the best &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting titles due to its combination of &quot;classic fighters and the new ones — like Kenshi the blind swordsman — which made us excited for the franchise&#x27;s future.&quot; This point of view was shared by Ravi Sinha of &quot;GamingBolt&quot;. However, &quot;The Daily Eastern News&quot; compared the 2011 reboot version of Kenshi to that of Kitana in an article on sexism and video games in regards to costume design playing a role in the objectification of female characters in the &quot;MK&quot; series. &quot;The male characters seemed more ready to get into a fight, while the females looked like they were about to go to the beach somewhere&quot;.

The character inspired blind Evolution Championship Series player Carlos Vasquez to create &quot;The Sento Showdown&quot;, a &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; tournament held yearly since 2019 that caters exclusively to vision-impaired players. He had previously shared accessibility concerns with NetherRealm Studios developer Herman Sanchez several years earlier that resulted in the company adding audio cues to their games beginning with &quot;&quot;. Vasquez was later hired by NetherRealm Studios as an accessibility consultant.

Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the storytelling of the second season of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; for &quot;newcomers like Kenshi requir[ing] a certain amount of back-story to justify their presence&quot;, which he felt caused many episodes to rely heavily on flashbacks that disrupted the flow of the plot. Sam Stone of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised Manny Jacinto&#x27;s voicework in &quot;Snow Blind&quot; as &quot;balancing braggadocio with charisma in effective measure; Kenshi is definitely a headstrong protagonist but is kept in check enough for the audience to become invested in his story.&quot; In her 2022 review, Brittany Vincent of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the film for &quot;weaving a story around one of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s lesser-known personalities&quot;, but opined that the storyline frequently diverted from Kenshi&#x27;s exploits &quot;when we&#x27;ve already been drawn in and want to learn more about him&quot;.

Author David Church noted the series&#x27; increase in Japanese cultural influence following the 1999 departure of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias, &quot;such as the blind swordsman Kenshi as a Zatoichi trope.&quot; A 2021 publication titled &quot;Fragile Avatars? Representations of Disability in Video Games&quot; described Kenshi, along with Daredevil and &quot;Killer7&quot; character Con Smith, as representing the &quot;blind avenger&quot; who sought revenge against those responsible for their blindness while possessing elevated senses. Matthew Essary of &quot;Polygon&quot;, in his feature on blind action heroes in popular culture, categorized Kenshi with &quot;The Matrix&quot; character Neo in the trope of their blindness &quot;actually improving their ability to fight back&quot; due to their supernatural abilities. This trait was criticized by author Jennifer Dalsen in the book &quot;Gaming Disability: Disability Perspectives on Contemporary Video Games&quot; as &quot;problematic because video games continue to use otherworldly powers as a way to accommodate or otherwise mitigate a disability,&quot; with her citing Kenshi and &quot;Perception&quot; protagonist Cassie Thornton as examples. Jef Rouner of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; expressed a similar opinion by unfavorably comparing the &quot;Daredevil-blind&quot; Kenshi to &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; character Bentley, who &quot;as a wheelchair user isn’t erasing his inability to walk the way someone like Kenshi being psychic effectively erases his inability to see.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, an addition theorem is a formula such as that for the exponential function:

:&quot;e&quot;&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;x&quot; · &quot;e&quot;&quot;y&quot;,

that expresses, for a particular function &quot;f&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) in terms of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). Slightly more generally, as is the case with the trigonometric functions and , several functions may be involved; this is more apparent than real, in that case, since there is an algebraic function of (in other words, we usually take their functions both as defined on the unit circle).

The scope of the idea of an addition theorem was fully explored in the nineteenth century, prompted by the discovery of the addition theorem for elliptic functions. To &quot;classify&quot; addition theorems it is necessary to put some restriction on the type of function &quot;G&quot; admitted, such that

:&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;(&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;F&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)).

In this identity one can assume that &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are vector-valued (have several components). An algebraic addition theorem is one in which &quot;G&quot; can be taken to be a vector of polynomials, in some set of variables. The conclusion of the mathematicians of the time was that the theory of abelian functions essentially exhausted the interesting possibilities: considered as a functional equation to be solved with polynomials, or indeed rational functions or algebraic functions, there were no further types of solution.

In more contemporary language this appears as part of the theory of algebraic groups, dealing with commutative groups. The connected, projective variety examples are indeed exhausted by abelian functions, as is shown by a number of results characterising an abelian variety by rather weak conditions on its group law. The so-called quasi-abelian functions are all known to come from extensions of abelian varieties by commutative affine group varieties. Therefore, the old conclusions about the scope of global algebraic addition theorems can be said to hold. A more modern aspect is the theory of formal groups.

<doc id="973858" wikidata="Q6145" url="?curid=973858" title="European hedgehog">
<text>The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), also known as the West European hedgehog or common hedgehog, is a hedgehog species native to Europe from Iberia and Italy northwards into Scandinavia and westwards into the British Isles. It is a generally common and widely distributed species that can survive across a wide range of habitat types. It is a well-known species, and a favourite in European gardens, both for its endearing appearance and its preference for eating a range of garden pests. While populations are currently stable across much of its range, it is declining severely in Great Britain where it is now Red Listed, meaning that it is considered to be at risk of local extinction. Outside its native range, the species was introduced to New Zealand during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Description==


The European hedgehog has a generalised body structure with unspecialised limb girdles. It appears brownish with most of its body covered by up to 6000 brown and white spines. The length of head and body is ~ at weaning, increasing to or more in large adults. It has an extremely short tail as an almost vestigial feature, typically . Weight increases from around at weaning to &gt; in adulthood. The maximum recorded weight is , though few wild specimens exceed even in autumn. Adult summer weight is typically somewhat less than in autumn, with an average of around and adult weights commonly as low as . Males tend to be slightly larger than females, but sex differences in body weight are overshadowed by enormous seasonal variation.

The European hedgehog is unlike any other creature across most of its range. Where it co-exists with the northern white-breasted hedgehog (&quot;Erinaceus roumanicus&quot;), the two species are difficult to distinguish in the field, the latter having a white spot on its chest. It is probably the largest hedgehog species and is possibly the heaviest member of the order Erinaceomorpha.

===Colour variation===
Leucistic or &quot;blonde&quot; hedgehogs occasionally occur. Such specimens are believed to have a pair of rare recessive genes, giving rise to their black eyes and creamy-coloured spines; however, they are not strictly speaking albino. They are extremely rare, except on North Ronaldsay and the Channel Island of Alderney where around 25% of the population is thought to be blonde. True albino morphs of the hedgehog occur infrequently.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The European hedgehog is largely nocturnal. It has a hesitant gait, frequently stopping to smell the air. Unlike the smaller, warmer-climate species, the European hedgehog may hibernate in the winter. However, most wake at least once to move their nests.

===Diet===


The European hedgehog is an insectivore. Its diet consists largely of earthworms, as well as snails and slugs, beetles, ants, bees and wasps, earwigs, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers, butterflies and moths, and caterpillars and other insect larvae. Eggs of ground-nesting birds are also taken, and carcasses may be foraged on. Hedgehogs may also eat lizards, snakes, frogs, and small rodents. Plant matter appears to make up only a negligible part of the hedgehog&#x27;s diet.

===Breeding===
The breeding season commences after hibernation. Pregnancies peak between May and July, though they have been recorded as late as September. Gestation is 31 to 35 days. The female alone raises the litter which typically numbers between four and six, though can range from two to ten. Studies have indicated that litter size may increase in more northern climes. The young are born blind with a covering of small spines. By the time they are 36 hours old, the second, outer coat of spines begins to sprout. By 11 days they can roll into a ball. Weaning occurs at around six weeks of age.

===Longevity and mortality===
European hedgehogs may live to more than ten years of age, although the average life expectancy is three years. Starvation is the most common cause of death, usually occurring during hibernation. If alarmed, the animal will roll into a ball to protect itself. Many potential predators are repelled by its spines, but predation does occur. Remains of hedgehogs have been found in the stomachs of red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), European badgers (&quot;Meles meles&quot;) and pine martens (&quot;Martes martes&quot;). A large portion of these may be from hedgehog carcasses, especially roadkill. However, hedgehogs tend to be absent from areas where badgers are numerous.

Eurasian eagle-owls (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) are the only regular avian predators of this species and may even prefer them as prey. The owl, after grabbing the hedgehog by its face, tends to skin the mammal&#x27;s prickly back with its talons before consumption, resulting in several hedgehog backs being found around eagle-owl roosts and nests. In Spain, reduction of European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) numbers due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease has made the European hedgehog one of the top preferred prey species for eagle-owls. Elsewhere, eagle-owls often prefer these hedgehogs to any other prey species, as the hedgehog can comprise up to 23% by number and 30.7% by biomass of eagle-owl prey remains. On the Swedish island of Gotland the golden eagle may take larger numbers of hedgehogs than any other prey due to an otherwise low diversity of native land mammals, although the introduction of European rabbits has shifted the eagle&#x27;s prey preferences there.

=== Nesting ===
European hedgehogs form nests where they spend much of their time. They construct three types of nests: breeding nests for birth and for protection of litters, day nests which are used during the summer months, and winter nests or hibernacula which are used for longer periods during winter months. Nests are often found under structures that can support them, such as roots or branches.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European hedgehog is native to Europe (including European Russia), with a global distribution extending from the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards through much of western to central Europe, and from southern Fennoscandia and the northern Baltic to north-west Russia. It is present also on Mediterranean islands (Corsica, Sardinia, Elba, Sicily), on most of the French Atlantic islands as well as on British Islands (autochthonous and introduced). It is an invasive exotic species in New Zealand and has probably been introduced to Ireland and many of the smaller islands where it occurs.

Colonists took hedgehogs from England and Scotland to New Zealand on sailing ships from the 1860s to the 1890s mainly as a biological control against agricultural pests or as a pet. Few survived the ca 50–100 days voyage, but those that did had lost all their fleas. Animals found their first homes in the South Island, where their spread was helped by guards dropping them off at country railway stations. Hedgehogs were introduced to the North Island in the 1890s, but some were also transported from South Island between 1906 and 1911 and, from then on, their numbers increased at an exponential rate. By the 1920s they had become so numerous that game-bird hunters blamed them for reduced bag-sizes. Hedgehogs were declared noxious animals and a bounty of one shilling a snout paid by regional authorities for several years. By the 1950s, hedgehogs could be found over the whole country with the exception of the coldest wettest corner of the South Island and alpine areas of permanent snow. Nevertheless, hedgehogs have been seen climbing New Zealand glaciers. Hedgehogs do not reach the same weight in New Zealand as in colder parts of Europe. With its milder winters, New Zealand hedgehogs hibernate for only three months of the year so do not need to put on so much weight in autumn as their ancestors. In northern New Zealand, many hedgehogs do not hibernate at all. One of New Zealand&#x27;s pioneer hedgehogs probably had faulty teeth for this feature is found in about 50% of today&#x27;s animals. Most New Zealanders welcome hedgehogs in their gardens as they relish slugs and snails. Conservationists are less happy as hedgehogs compete for invertebrate food with native bush birds and prey on some rare insects, lizards and ground-nesting birds. As a result, extensive hedgehog-control programs are under way in some parts of the country, killing thousands of them. To judge by roadkill counts, North Island hedgehogs were at their highest numbers in the 1950s. Since then, roadkill counts have fallen dramatically from about 50/100 km to less than 1/100 km.

The European hedgehog is found across a wide range of habitat types, encompassing both semi-natural vegetation types and those areas that have been heavily modified by man. The range includes woodland, grasslands such as meadows and pasture, arable land, orchards and vineyards as well as within the matrix of habitat types found in human settlements. It prefers lowlands and hills up to 400–600m, but is also locally present on mountains, exceptionally up to an altitude of 1500–2000m (e.g. Alps and Pyrenees). Outside cultivated land it prefers marginal zones of forests, particularly ecotonal grass and scrub vegetation.

Hedgehogs are most abundant within the gardens, parks and amenity land close to or within human settlements. They are generally scarce in areas of marshes and moorland, probably because of a lack of suitable sites and materials for the construction of winter nests (or hibernacula), which have specific requirements. In Finland, they use pine trees roots especially for nests in the winter.

==Conservation==
Generally, the hedgehog is widely distributed and can be found in good numbers where people are tolerant of their residence in gardens. The IUCN classifies the species as Near Threatened and currently the population as Stable. In some areas, they are common victims of road kills and may be hunted by dogs, such as in Sardinia. On 28 August 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan included the European hedgehog on the list of species and habitats in Britain that need conservation and greater protection.

In Denmark and Poland, the European hedgehog is protected by law. It is illegal to capture or hurt them, but rehabilitation of unhealthy hedgehogs is accepted. It is protected in all European countries which have signed the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.

A low coverage assembly of the genome of &quot;Erinaceus europaeus&quot; was released by the Broad Institute in June 2006 as part of the Mammalian Genome Project.

==Status in Great Britain==
===Population size===
An estimate of 36.5 million by Burton was based on extrapolating up from a density of 2.5 animals/ha (one per acre), but this was based on limited data and is probably an overestimate. A more recent estimate of 1,550,000 in Great Britain (England 1,100,000, Scotland 310,000, Wales 140,000) is more reliable, but still has a high degree of uncertainty as it is based on very limited information about hedgehog density estimates for different habitat types. Given this figure, and more firmly established rates of decline, it is now thought likely that there are fewer than a million hedgehogs in Great Britain. In the UK badgers are the main predator of hedgehogs, and also compete for some of the same foods. Badger numbers have increased substantially in recent years due to increased legal protection, and increased predation by badgers may well be a major cause of declining hedgehog numbers in England.

===Population status===
In 2007 the hedgehog was classified a Biodiversity Action Plan &quot;priority&quot; species in Britain, largely in response to negative trends identified in national surveys such as &quot;Mammals on Roads&quot; survey, run by People&#x27;s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), that found an annual decline in counts of road casualties of around 7% from 2001 to 2004. Historic data from the &quot;National Gamebag Census&quot; suggest a steady decline between 1960 and 1980. Evidence from a questionnaire in 2005 and 2006 also supported an ongoing decline, with almost half of ~20,000 participants in PTES&#x27; &quot;Hogwatch &quot;survey reporting the impression that there were fewer hedgehogs than there were five years earlier.

A review of the available survey data for the population trend of the hedgehog in Britain was undertaken by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) in a report commissioned by PTES and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS). This concluded that, at a conservative estimate, 25% of the British hedgehog population had been lost in a decade. The report also highlighted the importance of long-term monitoring to provide datasets with sufficient power to allow the changes to the population to be identified. Currently, the most important monitoring programmes involved in collecting information about the status of the British hedgehog population are PTES’ &quot;Mammals on Roads&quot; and &quot;Living with Mammals&quot; surveys, and the BTO &quot;Breeding Bird Survey&quot; and &quot;Garden BirdWatch&quot; survey. A recent review of these surveys now suggests that rural populations have declined by at least a half and urban populations by up to a third since 2000.

==Pest status==
This species has become a serious pest in areas where it has been introduced outside of its native range. One such location is the Western Isles of Scotland, where introduced hedgehogs eat the eggs of ground-nesting waders such as common snipe, dunlin, common redshank and northern lapwing. It is also considered a pest in New Zealand where it preys upon various native fauna, including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds. As with many introduced animals, it lacks natural predators.

Attempts to eliminate hedgehogs from bird colonies on the Scottish islands of North Uist and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides were met with international outrage. Eradication began in 2003 with 690 hedgehogs being killed. Animal welfare groups attempted rescues to save the hedgehogs. By 2007, legal injunctions against the killing of hedgehogs were put in place. In 2008, the elimination process was changed from killing the hedgehogs to trapping them and releasing them on the mainland.

==In popular culture==
* From the early 1950s until the 1980s, the hedgehog was sometimes seen as an unofficial symbol of NATO in numerous countries, as it represented a peaceful animal that bristles in defence.

<text>Lipcani () is a town in Briceni District, Moldova. It is also a border crossing between Moldova and Romania.

== Overview ==

Lipcani is located on the banks of the Prut river, which forms the border with Romania. The border with Ukraine (Criva border crossing point) is also only a few kilometers to the north. Lipcani is located in the Bessarabia region. The closest large urban centres are Chernivtsi in Ukraine, Suceava in Romania, and Bălți in Moldova. Lipcani is about from the Ukrainian city of Khotyn. The town is crossed by a small river called Medvedca.

Because of misspelling or translation difficulties, it is also referred to as: Lipcan, Lipcany, Lipkan, Lipkani, Lipchen, Lipcheny, Lipcheni, Lipcani Targ, Lipceni, Lipchany, Lypchany, Lipchani, Lipkamya, Lepkan, Lepkany, Lepkani, Lepcan, Lepcany, Lepcani, Linkani, Liptchani, Lipkane, Lipkon and Lipcon.

There was a different synagogue for each guild: tailors, shoemakers, cabmen, etc. &quot;Guild&quot; synagogues were located in neighborhoods in the outskirts of town. Richer Jews had big synagogues in the center of town. There were 4,698 Jews on the eve of World War II.

Since the Communist system promoted atheism, the authorities began to fight religion by closing synagogues, churches and cheders.
* August 2, 1940: The Moldavian SSR was formed, which included Bessarabia without its Southern part. Territories given to Ukraine initially included Edineț, Briceni, Lipcani and Ocnița. When the Soviets came, Lipcani was a town near the border. It belonged to the USSR and the area beyond the town was Romania.
* November 4, 1940: The borders were changed by the decree of the SS of USSR.

* July 28, 1941: All Jews from Briceni were dispatched across the Dniester and several were shot en route. When they arrived in Mogilev, the Germans &quot;selected&quot; the old people and forced the younger ones to dig graves for them. From Mogilev the rest were turned back to Ataki and then on to Sekiryany. Hundreds died en route. For a month they stayed in the ghetto, only to be deported again to Transnistria. All the young Jews were murdered in the forest near Soroca.
* October 9 and 10 (1941): Jews from Rădăuți were carried to their death in train wagons meant for transporting animals. These trains passed through Lipcani. There, the Germans sent one group to the Dniester through Ataki, and the other group to Mărculeşti.

* 1944: Jassy–Kishinev Offensive (August 1944). The Red Army drove the Romanian and German armies out of Bessarabia, which became an integral part of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (as of 2006, most of Bessarabia is part of the independent Republic of Moldova and has been so since the dissolution of the USSR).
* July 6–20, 1996: A water ecological expedition called &quot;Prut 96&quot;, organized by the NGO called Association of Ecological Education and Information &quot;Terra Nostra&quot; was held down the Prut river from the village of Lipcani to the village of Sculeni in the Ungheni region. The goal of the expedition was to examine the Prut river with the participation of students and post-graduates in order to attract attention of the population and state services towards the ecological problems of the river and the whole region.
* April 7, 1999: The Lipcani soccer team Venita lost to the FC Olimpia Bălți in the quarterfinals for the Moldovan Cup 1998/1999.

<text>Slash Records was an American record label originally specializing in local punk rock bands, active from 1978 to 2000. It was notable as one of the first and most successful independent record labels in alternative music, before its eventual acquisition by Warner Music Group.

== History ==
The label was formed in 1978 by Bob Biggs. Biggs, a painter, initiated the label with a seven-inch single from the Germs in 1978. A full album from that band was released the next year, and X&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles&quot; followed in 1980. The label was distributed through Jem until 1981 when that company went bankrupt. Slash then entered into a distribution deal with Warner Bros., a move that was among the first collaborations between a self-started indie and a major label. During the time of this arrangement, the label released albums by prominent Los Angeles punk and rock and roll bands, including Fear, The Blasters, L7 and Los Lobos, as well as comparable punk and garage rock bands such as Austin&#x27;s Rank and File and Boston&#x27;s Del Fuegos.

The label flourished even after the magazine stopped in 1980. A subsidiary, Ruby Records, was started in 1981; Ruby released albums by Misfits, Dream Syndicate, and The Gun Club. By the mid-1980s, Slash had branched out beyond Southern California, releasing albums by Robyn Hitchcock and Burning Spear. From 1982 until 1996, releases from Slash Records were distributed in North America by Warner Bros. Records and Reprise Records, and elsewhere by PolyGram.

The label was sold to London Records in 1996. Universal Music Group (the owner of American Decca) was formed through the merger of the MCA and PolyGram Records families, the latter of which owned London Records, in 2000 and closed Slash as an active label. When London Records president Roger Ames moved to Warner Music Group, he retained the rights to London and Slash, and the back catalogue of Slash was acquired by Warner (excluding Rammstein and Harvey Danger). In 2003, Ames relicensed the use of the name Slash back to Bob Biggs, who then relaunched the label. The revived label only released one album, the eponymous debut album by Shiner Massive, before it was closed again due to &quot;high losses&quot;.

As of 2018, Slash solely exists as a reissue label. Between 2016 and 2017, Warner Music, the parent company of Slash, sold off the rights to several former Slash artists; this included the sale of Violent Femmes to Concord Music, Failure to PIAS Recordings, Soul Coughing to Swedish indie Woah Dad!, and Grant Lee Buffalo to Chrysalis Records.

Biggs died in October 2020.

<text>BIOS-3 is an experimental closed ecosystem at the Institute of Biophysics in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

Its construction began in 1965, and was completed in 1972. BIOS-3 consists of a underground steel structure suitable for up to three persons, and was initially used for developing closed ecological human life-support ecosystems. It was divided into 4 compartments, one of which is a crew area. The crew area consists of 3 single-cabins, a galley, lavatory and control room. Initially one other compartment was an algal cultivator, and the other two phytotrons for growing wheat or vegetables. The plants growing in the two phytotrons contributed approximately 25% of the air filtering in the compound. Later, the algal cultivator was converted into a third phytotron. A level of light comparable to sunlight was supplied in each of the 4 compartments by 20 kW xenon lamps, cooled by water jackets. The facility used 400 kW of electricity, supplied by a nearby hydroelectric power station.

Chlorella algae were used to recycle air breathed by humans, absorbing carbon dioxide and replenishing it with oxygen through photosynthesis. The algae were cultivated in stacked tanks under artificial light. To achieve a balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide, one human needed of exposed Chlorella. Air was purified of more complex organic compounds by heating to in the presence of a catalyst. Water and nutrients were stored in advance and were also recycled. By 1968, system efficiency had reached 85% by recycling water. Dried meat was imported into the facility, and urine and feces were generally dried and stored, rather than being recycled.

BIOS-3 facilities were used to conduct 10 manned closure experiments with a one to three man crew. The longest experiment with a three-man crew lasted 180 days (in 1972-1973). The facilities were used for the tests at least until 1984. 

In 1986, Dr. Josef Gitelson, head of the Institute of Biophysics (IBP) at Krasnoyarsk and developer of biospherics as well the BIOS project, met with Oleg Gazenko, Mark Nelson, John Allen and others involved with Biosphere 2, which led to further cooperation. In 1989, a group from Biosphere 2 visited the BIOS-3 facilities. Mark Nelson and John Allen have acknowledged the importance of BIOS-3 and Russian insights to Biosphere 2.

In 1991, BIOS-3 became a part of the International Center for Closed Ecosystems, which was formed as a subdivision of Institute of Biophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch. Closed ecosystems research focusing on growing plants and recycling waste was resumed in 2005 in cooperation with European Space Agency.

<doc id="973878" wikidata="Q716962" url="?curid=973878" title="Theophilus Cibber">
<text>Theophilus Cibber (25 or 26 November 1703 – October 1758) was an English actor, playwright, author, and son of the actor-manager Colley Cibber.

He began acting at an early age, and followed his father into theatrical management. In 1727, Alexander Pope satirised Theophilus Cibber in his &quot;Dunciad&quot; as a youth who &quot;thrusts his person full into your face&quot; (III 132). On the stage, he was famous for playing Pistol in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and some of the comic roles his father had played when younger, but unsympathetic critics accused him of overemphasis. His private life later led Theophilus into bad reputation and scandal. In October of 1758, Theophilus set sail for Dublin at the behest of Thomas Sheridan, owner of the Theatre Royal. However, his ship was driven off course and Theophilus perished when it was wrecked off the coast of Scotland.

==Early life and career==
Theophilus Cibber was born during the Great Storm of 1703 and began acting in the Drury Lane Theatre at the age of 16 in 1721. As a young man, Cibber was a notorious rake, and associated with young men of a similar mind and reputation, such as the Duke of Wharton.

As the son of Catherine and Colley Cibber, one of the theatre&#x27;s managers, Theophilus became involved in the management of Drury Lane. In 1723, he became manager of the summer season, and in 1727 became assistant manager during the regular season. In 1732, one of the managers, Barton Booth, sold his share to John Highmore, and another of the managers, Robert Wilks, fell ill and died. Cibber senior became disenchanted by the involvement of Wilks&#x27; widow, through her representative John Ellys, in the management of the company. He dropped out of the management and leased his share in the company to his son. Cibber junior took the lead in the management of the theatre during the 1732–33 season, until he fell ill. The actions of Ellys and Highmore in his absence, which appear to have been largely centred on saving or making money, irritated Theophilus and friction grew between them. The other managers approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Colley Cibber sold them his share for 3,000 guineas, and they promptly gave Theophilus his notice. Theophilus led the actors in a walkout and they set themselves up as rival, but informal, company of players in the Haymarket. The Cibbers applied for a letters patent to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused, and the Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down Cibber by conspiring in the arrest of his leading actor, John Harper, on a charge of vagrancy. Public opinion swung to Theophilus&#x27; side, and Harper was released. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on his own terms.

Theophilus married actress Jane Johnson and they had four children: Colley George in 1726, Catherine in 1727, Jane in 1729, and Elizabeth in 1732. Colley George and Catherine died in infancy, and their mother died at the age of 26 just after the birth of Elizabeth from puerperal fever. Jane and Elizabeth were raised in the house of their grandfather, Colley Cibber.

==Adultery case scandal==

Two years after the death of his first wife, Jane, Cibber married the singer and actress Susannah Maria Arne, the sister of musician Thomas Arne on 21 April 1734. Unusually, Susannah Maria insisted on a prenuptial agreement that protected her own property and income by placing it in the hands of two trustees, who released it to her in small amounts. Theophilus had no access to the money, and the agreement stipulated that if she died without children, then the money was to be inherited by her parents rather than her husband. They had two children, Susannah in 1735 and Caius-Gabriel in 1736, but both died aged less than a year.

Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria were members of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife&#x27;s earnings from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber&#x27;s connivance in his wife&#x27;s adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter to say that she was leaving him for Sloper.

Cibber returned to England, and began negotiating a settlement with Susannah Maria and Sloper, punctuated by an absurd but successful attempt to abduct Susannah Maria from Sloper&#x27;s country house that ended with all three of them staying at the same inn, despite Sloper firing a pistol over Cibber&#x27;s head. Theophilus confined his wife to a house in Wild Court, Great Wild Street, from where she was rescued by her brother Thomas who broke in and knocked out the guard. Theophilus had Thomas imprisoned in Bridewell temporarily, and Susannah Maria returned to Sloper. Becoming greedy, Cibber sued Sloper for £5,000 damages for criminal conversation, which he described as threatening &quot;his peace of mind, his happiness, and his hopes of posterity&quot;. The prosecution produced witnesses, lodging house keepers Mr and Mrs Hayes, who admitted to spying on Sloper and Mrs Cibber through a wainscot partition, thus establishing adultery beyond doubt. Sloper&#x27;s defence counsel rebutted by calling the Kensington housekeeper, Anne Hopson, who testified that Cibber received money from Sloper with full knowledge of his wife&#x27;s affair. The defence said of Cibber: &quot;He takes his money, lets him maintain his family, resigns his wife to him, and then comes to court for justice, for reparation in damages.&quot; Counsel concluded that &quot;there is no denomination in coin small enough to give in damages.&quot; The jury concurred, and awarded Cibber a nominal £10.

==Decline==
Sloper retired to the country, and Susannah gave up performing for a while. When Cibber appeared as Lord Foppington in &quot;The Relapse&quot; at Drury Lane, he was pelted with fruit and garbage. The following year, 1739, Cibber brought an action against Sloper for £10,000 for &quot;detaining&quot; his wife. This time he was awarded £500. Susannah went to Ireland and a concert season with Handel while the scandal died down, but later returned to have a successful career at Drury Lane, working with David Garrick and becoming famous as a tragic actress. Cibber lost his influence in the theatre and spent his remaining years switching from venue to venue, taking the occasional part. His exaggerated acting style was out of fashion and unpopular, and he drank to excess.

His father died on 11 December 1757, leaving Theophilus just £50 in his will, and the following day Theophilus wrote to the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, asking for work in a theatre. Theophilus&#x27; eulogy to his father, delivered on stage dressed in mourning, was not a success, and he was forced to look for work elsewhere. Thomas Sheridan offered him work at the Smock Alley Theatre (known as the Theatre Royal) in Dublin. On the trip to Ireland, his ship, the &quot;Dublin Trader&quot; with about 60 passengers on board, foundered in a storm, and was wrecked on the Scottish coast. He was lost at sea.

==Authorship==
At the age of 17, Cibber adapted Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry VI, &quot;An Historical Tragedy of the Civil Wars in Reign of King Henry VI&quot;. Later, he adapted &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in which he played Romeo opposite his 14-year-old daughter, Jenny, as Juliet. Theophilus&#x27; plays, which include the ballad opera &quot;Patie and Peggie&quot;, the comedy &quot;The Lover&quot;, the farce &quot;The Auction&quot; and the pantomime &quot;The Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot;, are of no great merit. They were published in a modern edition by David Mann in 1981.

Theophilus&#x27; authorship of &quot;Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift&quot; (1753) is disputed; Samuel Johnson claimed that it was written by Robert Shiels. Most of the text is lifted from earlier works by Gerard Langbaine and Giles Jacob. Other works in Theophilus&#x27; name are &quot;A Letter from Theophilus Cibber to John Highmore&quot; (1733), &quot;A Lick at a Liar: or Calumny Detected. Being an Occasional Letter to a Friend&quot; (1752), &quot;An Epistle from Mr Theophilus Cibber to David Garrick, esq.&quot; (1755), and &quot;Two Dissertations on the Theatres&quot; (1756), which despite the title was in three parts.

In April 1740, Theophilus&#x27; father published an autobiography, &quot;An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, Comedian&quot;, which was a commercial success. Shortly after its release, Theophilus drew up a proposal for his own autobiography and began to collect advances from prospective subscribers. In July, &quot;An Apology for the Life of Mr. , Comedian: Being a Proper Sequel to The Apology for the Life of Mr. Colley Cibber, Comedian, with an Historical View of the Stage to the Present Year / Supposed to be Written by Himself in the Style and Manner of the Poet Laureate&quot;, was published but Theophilus was not the author. It was an anonymous attack against the Cibbers patterned on Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;succès de scandale&quot; autobiography. Theophilus claimed he returned the subscriptions and threatened the publishers with a lawsuit, but nothing came of his threats. The author was never discovered, but Henry Fielding was suspected. Fielding&#x27;s 20th-century biographer Wilbur Lucius Cross thought that Fielding &quot;did not actually write the book, [but] was doubtless in the secret, and may have lent his aid here and there&quot;.

<text>Erinaceidae is a family in the order Eulipotyphla, consisting of the hedgehogs and moonrats. Until recently, it was assigned to the order Erinaceomorpha, which has been subsumed with the paraphyletic Soricomorpha into Eulipotyphla. Eulipotyphla has been shown to be monophyletic; Soricomorpha is paraphyletic because both Soricidae and Talpidae share a more recent common ancestor with Erinaceidae than with solenodons.

Erinaceidae contains the well-known hedgehogs (subfamily Erinaceinae) of Eurasia and Africa and the gymnures or moonrats (subfamily Galericinae) of Southeast Asia. This family was once considered part of the order Insectivora, but that polyphyletic order is now considered defunct.

==Characteristics==
Erinaceids are generally shrew-like in form, with long snouts and short tails. They are, however, much larger than shrews, ranging from in body length and in weight, in the case of the short-tailed gymnure, up to and in the moonrat. All but one species have five toes in each foot, in some cases with strong claws for digging, and they have large eyes and ears. Hedgehogs possess hair modified into sharp spines to form a protective covering over the upper body and flanks, while gymnures have only normal hair. Most species have anal scent glands, but these are far better developed in gymnures, which can have a powerful odor.

Erinaceids are omnivorous, with the major part of their diet consisting of insects, earthworms, and other small invertebrates. They also eat seeds and fruit, and occasionally birds&#x27; eggs, along with any carrion they come across. Their teeth are sharp and suited for impaling invertebrate prey. The dental formula for erinaceids is: 

Hedgehogs are nocturnal, but gymnures are less so, and may be active during the day. Many species live in simple burrows, while others construct temporary nests on the surface from leaves and grass, or shelter in hollow logs or similar hiding places. Erinaceids are solitary animals outside the breeding season, and the father plays no role in raising the young.

Female erinaceids give birth after a gestation period of around six to seven weeks. The young are born blind and hairless, although hedgehogs begin to sprout their spines within 36 hours of birth.

==Evolution==
Erinaceids are a group of placental mammals that have retained many of their ancestral traits, having changed little since their origin in the Eocene. The so-called &#x27;giant hedgehog&#x27; (actually a gymnure) &quot;Deinogalerix&quot;, from the Miocene of Gargano Island (part of modern Italy), was the size of a large rabbit, and may have eaten vertebrate prey or carrion, rather than insects.

<text>The Lhasa Apso ( ) is a non-sporting dog breed originating in Tibet. Traditionally the breed has been used as an interior watchdog.

== Etymology ==


Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and &quot;apso&quot; is a word from the Tibetan language. There is some debate over the exact origin of the name; some claim that the word &quot;apso&quot; is an anglicized form of the Tibetan word for goatee (&quot;ag-tshom&quot;, ཨག་ཚོམ་) or perhaps &quot;ra-pho&quot; (ར་ཕོ་) meaning &quot;billy goat&quot;. It may also be a compound noun meaning &quot;bark-guard&quot; (lit. &quot;ap&quot; [ཨཔ], to bark, and &quot;so&quot; [སོ་], to guard).

== History ==
The Lhasa Apso is a thousand-year-old breed that historically served as sentinels at palaces and monasteries isolated high in the Himalayas of Tibet. In the early twentieth century some Tibetan dogs were brought to the United Kingdom by military men returning from the Indian subcontinent. These were of mixed types, similar either to what would become the Lhasa Apso or to what would become the Tibetan Terrier; they were collectively known as &quot;Lhasa Terriers&quot;.

The first American pair of Lhasas were a gift from Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the United States in 1933. Mr. Cutting had traveled to Tibet and met the Dalai Lama. At the time, there was only one Lhasa Apso registered in England. The American Kennel Club officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier Group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting Group. In the UK, they are placed in the Utility Group.

The breed was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1960.

== Characteristics ==

Dogs stand about at the withers, bitches slightly less. The coat may be black, red, dark grizzle, golden, honey, parti-colour, sandy, slate-coloured, smoke-coloured or white. It is thick and heavy, with a hard straight outer coat and a medium under-coat. The eyes are dark and the nose is black, and the ears are pendant. The tail is curved, sometimes with a kink at the tip, and should be carried over the back.

It ranks 68th (out of 138) in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, having fair working-obedience intelligence. The Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with many living in good health into their early 20s.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

<text>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML, pronounced &quot;SAM-el&quot;, ) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security assertions (statements that service providers use to make access-control decisions). SAML is also:
* A set of XML-based protocol messages
* A set of protocol message bindings
* A set of profiles (utilizing all of the above)

An important use case that SAML addresses is web-browser single sign-on (SSO). Single sign-on is relatively easy to accomplish within a security domain (using cookies, for example) but extending SSO across security domains is more difficult and resulted in the proliferation of non-interoperable proprietary technologies. The SAML Web Browser SSO profile was specified and standardized to promote interoperability. In practice, SAML SSO is most commonly used for authentication into cloud-based business software.

== Overview ==

The SAML specification defines three roles: the principal (typically a human user), the identity provider (IdP) and the service provider (SP). In the primary use case addressed by SAML, the principal requests a service from the service provider. The service provider requests and obtains an authentication assertion from the identity provider. On the basis of this assertion, the service provider can make an access control decision, that is, it can decide whether to perform the service for the connected principal.

At the heart of the SAML assertion is a subject (a principal within the context of a particular security domain) about which something is being asserted. The subject is usually (but not necessarily) a human. As in the SAML 2.0 Technical Overview, the terms subject and principal are used interchangeably in this document.

Before delivering the subject-based assertion from IdP to the SP, the IdP may request some information from the principal—such as a user name and password—in order to authenticate the principal. SAML specifies the content of the assertion that is passed from the IdP to the SP. In SAML, one identity provider may provide SAML assertions to many service providers. Similarly, one SP may rely on and trust assertions from many independent IdPs.

SAML does not specify the method of authentication at the identity provider. The IdP may use a username and password, or some other form of authentication, including multi-factor authentication. A directory service such as RADIUS, LDAP, or Active Directory that allows users to log in with a user name and password is a typical source of authentication tokens at an identity provider. The popular Internet social networking services also provide identity services that in theory could be used to support SAML exchanges.

== History ==

The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Security Services Technical Committee (SSTC), which met for the first time in January 2001, was chartered &quot;to define an XML framework for exchanging authentication and authorization information.&quot; To this end, the following intellectual property was contributed to the SSTC during the first two months of that year:
* &quot;Security Services Markup Language&quot; (S2ML) from Netegrity
* &quot;AuthXML&quot; from Securant
* &quot;XML Trust Assertion Service Specification&quot; (X-TASS) from VeriSign
* &quot;Information Technology Markup Language&quot; (ITML) from Jamcracker

Building on these initial contributions, in November 2002 OASIS announced the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 1.0 specification as an OASIS Standard.

Meanwhile, the Liberty Alliance, a large consortium of companies, non-profit and government organizations, proposed an extension to the SAML standard called the Liberty Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF). Like its SAML predecessor, Liberty ID-FF proposed a standardized, cross-domain, web-based, single sign-on framework. In addition, Liberty described a &quot;circle of trust&quot; where each participating domain is trusted to accurately document the processes used to identify a user, the type of authentication system used, and any policies associated with the resulting authentication credentials. Other members of the circle of trust could then examine these policies to determine whether to trust such information.

While Liberty was developing ID-FF, the SSTC began work on a minor upgrade to the SAML standard. The resulting SAML 1.1 specification was ratified by the SSTC in September 2003. Then, in November of that same year, Liberty contributed ID-FF 1.2 to OASIS, thereby sowing the seeds for the next major version of SAML. In March 2005, SAML 2.0 was announced as an OASIS Standard. SAML 2.0 represents the convergence of Liberty ID-FF and proprietary extensions contributed by the Shibboleth project, as well as early versions of SAML itself. Most SAML implementations support v2.0 while many still support v1.1 for backward compatibility. By January 2008, deployments of SAML 2.0 became common in government, higher education, and commercial enterprises worldwide.

== Versions ==

SAML has undergone one minor and one major revision since 1.0.
* SAML 1.0 was adopted as an OASIS Standard in November 2002
* SAML 1.1 was ratified as an OASIS Standard in September 2003
* SAML 2.0 became an OASIS Standard in March 2005

The Liberty Alliance contributed its Identity Federation Framework (ID-FF) to the OASIS SSTC in September 2003:
* ID-FF 1.1 was released in April 2003
* ID-FF 1.2 was finalized in November 2003

Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of SAML are similar even though small differences exist., however, the differences between SAML 2.0 and SAML 1.1 are substantial. Although the two standards address the same use case, SAML 2.0 is incompatible with its predecessor.

Although ID-FF 1.2 was contributed to OASIS as the basis of SAML 2.0, there are some important differences between SAML 2.0 and ID-FF 1.2. In particular, the two specifications, despite their common roots, are incompatible.

== Design ==

SAML is built upon a number of existing standards:

* Extensible Markup Language (XML): Most SAML exchanges are expressed in a standardized dialect of XML, which is the root for the name SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language).
* XML Schema (XSD): SAML assertions and protocols are specified (in part) using XML Schema.
* XML Signature: Both SAML 1.1 and SAML 2.0 use digital signatures (based on the XML Signature standard) for authentication and message integrity.
* XML Encryption: Using XML Encryption, SAML 2.0 provides elements for encrypted name identifiers, encrypted attributes, and encrypted assertions (SAML 1.1 does not have encryption capabilities). XML Encryption is reported to have severe security concerns.
* Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): SAML relies heavily on HTTP as its communications protocol.
* Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP): SAML specifies the use of SOAP, specifically SOAP 1.1 .

SAML defines XML-based assertions and protocols, bindings, and profiles. The term &quot;SAML Core&quot; refers to the general syntax and semantics of SAML assertions as well as the protocol used to request and transmit those assertions from one system entity to another. &quot;SAML protocol&quot; refers to what is transmitted, not how (the latter is determined by the choice of binding). So SAML Core defines &quot;bare&quot; SAML assertions along with SAML request and response elements.

A &quot;SAML binding&quot; determines how SAML requests and responses map onto standard messaging or communications protocols. An important (synchronous) binding is the SAML SOAP binding.

A &quot;SAML profile&quot; is a concrete manifestation of a defined use case using a particular combination of assertions, protocols and bindings.

=== Assertions ===

A SAML &quot;assertion&quot; contains a packet of security information:

 &lt;saml:Assertion ...&gt;
 &lt;/saml:Assertion&gt;

Loosely speaking, a relying party interprets an assertion as follows:

Assertion &quot;A&quot; was issued at time &quot;t&quot; by issuer &quot;R&quot; regarding subject &quot;S&quot; provided conditions &quot;C&quot; are valid.

SAML assertions are usually transferred from identity providers to service providers. Assertions contain &quot;statements&quot; that service providers use to make access-control decisions. Three types of statements are provided by SAML:

# Authentication statements
# Attribute statements
# Authorization decision statements

&quot;Authentication statements&quot; assert to the service provider that the principal did indeed authenticate with the identity provider at a particular time using a particular method of authentication. Other information about the authenticated principal (called the &quot;authentication context&quot;) may be disclosed in an authentication statement.

An &quot;attribute statement&quot; asserts that a principal is associated with certain attributes. An &quot;attribute&quot; is simply a name–value pair. Relying parties use attributes to make access-control decisions.

An &quot;authorization decision statement&quot; asserts that a principal is permitted to perform action &quot;A&quot; on resource &quot;R&quot; given evidence &quot;E&quot;. The expressiveness of authorization decision statements in SAML is intentionally limited. More-advanced use cases are encouraged to use XACML instead.

=== Protocols ===
A SAML &quot;protocol&quot; describes how certain SAML elements (including assertions) are packaged within SAML request and response elements, and gives the processing rules that SAML entities must follow when producing or consuming these elements. For the most part, a SAML protocol is a simple request-response protocol.

The most important type of SAML protocol request is called a &quot;query&quot;. A service provider makes a query directly to an identity provider over a secure back channel. Thus query messages are typically bound to SOAP.

Corresponding to the three types of statements, there are three types of SAML queries:

# Authentication query
# Attribute query
# Authorization decision query

The result of an attribute query is a SAML response containing an assertion, which itself contains an attribute statement. See the SAML 2.0 topic for an example of attribute query/response.

Beyond queries, SAML 1.1 specifies no other protocols.

SAML 2.0 expands the notion of &quot;protocol&quot; considerably. The following protocols are described in detail in SAML 2.0 Core:
* Assertion Query and Request Protocol
* Authentication Request Protocol
* Artifact Resolution Protocol
* Name Identifier Management Protocol
* Single Logout Protocol
* Name Identifier Mapping Protocol

Most of these protocols are new in SAML 2.0.

=== Bindings ===
A SAML &quot;binding&quot; is a mapping of a SAML protocol message onto standard messaging formats and/or communications protocols. For example, the SAML SOAP binding specifies how a SAML message is encapsulated in a SOAP envelope, which itself is bound to an HTTP message.

SAML 1.1 specifies just one binding, the SAML SOAP Binding. In addition to SOAP, implicit in SAML 1.1 Web Browser SSO are the precursors of the HTTP POST Binding, the HTTP Redirect Binding, and the HTTP Artifact Binding. These are not defined explicitly, however, and are only used in conjunction with SAML 1.1 Web Browser SSO. The notion of binding is not fully developed until SAML 2.0.

SAML 2.0 completely separates the binding concept from the underlying profile. In fact, there is a brand new binding specification in SAML 2.0 that defines the following standalone bindings:
* SAML SOAP Binding (based on SOAP 1.1)
* Reverse SOAP (PAOS) Binding
* HTTP Redirect (GET) Binding
* HTTP POST Binding
* HTTP Artifact Binding
* SAML URI Binding

This reorganization provides tremendous flexibility: taking just Web Browser SSO alone as an example, a service provider can choose from four bindings (HTTP Redirect, HTTP POST and two flavors of HTTP Artifact), while the identity provider has three binding options (HTTP POST plus two forms of HTTP Artifact), for a total of twelve possible deployments of the SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile.

=== Profiles ===

A SAML &quot;profile&quot; describes in detail how SAML assertions, protocols, and bindings combine to support a defined use case. The most important SAML profile is the Web Browser SSO Profile.

SAML 1.1 specifies two forms of Web Browser SSO, the Browser/Artifact Profile and the Browser/POST Profile. The latter passes assertions &quot;by value&quot; whereas Browser/Artifact passes assertions &quot;by reference&quot;. As a consequence, Browser/Artifact requires a back-channel SAML exchange over SOAP. In SAML 1.1, all flows begin with a request at the identity provider for simplicity. Proprietary extensions to the basic IdP-initiated flow have been proposed (by Shibboleth, for example).

The Web Browser SSO Profile was completely refactored for SAML 2.0. Conceptually, SAML 1.1 Browser/Artifact and Browser/POST are special cases of SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO. The latter is considerably more flexible than its SAML 1.1 counterpart due to the new &quot;plug-and-play&quot; binding design of SAML 2.0. Unlike previous versions, SAML 2.0 browser flows begin with a request at the service provider. This provides greater flexibility, but SP-initiated flows naturally give rise to the so-called &quot;Identity Provider Discovery&quot; problem, the focus of much research today. In addition to Web Browser SSO, SAML 2.0 introduces numerous new profiles:
* SSO Profiles
** Web Browser SSO Profile
** Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) Profile
** Identity Provider Discovery Profile
** Single Logout Profile
** Name Identifier Management Profile
* Artifact Resolution Profile
* Assertion Query/Request Profile
* Name Identifier Mapping Profile
* SAML Attribute Profiles

Aside from the SAML Web Browser SSO Profile, some important third-party profiles of SAML include:
* OASIS Web Services Security (WSS) Technical Committee
* Liberty Alliance
* OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Technical Committee

=== Security ===
The SAML specifications recommend, and in some cases mandate, a variety of security mechanisms:
* TLS 1.0+ for transport-level security
* XML Signature and XML Encryption for message-level security

Requirements are often phrased in terms of (mutual) authentication, integrity, and confidentiality, leaving the choice of security mechanism to implementers and deployers.

== Use ==

The primary SAML use case is called &quot;Web Browser Single Sign-On (SSO)&quot;. A user utilizes a &quot;user agent&quot; (usually a web browser) to request a web resource protected by a SAML &quot;service provider&quot;. The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the requesting user, issues an authentication request to a SAML &quot;identity provider&quot; through the user agent. The resulting protocol flow is depicted in the following diagram.


; 1. Request the target resource at the SP (SAML 2.0 only): The principal (via an HTTPs user agent) requests a target resource at the service provider: The service provider performs a security check on behalf of the target resource. If a valid security context at the service provider already exists, skip steps 2–7.
; 2. Redirect to the SSO Service at the IdP (SAML 2.0 only):The service provider determines the user&#x27;s preferred identity provider (by unspecified means) and redirects the user agent to the SSO Service at the identity provider: The value of the codice_1 parameter (denoted by the placeholder codice_2 above) is the Base64 encoding of a deflated codice_3 element.
; 3. Request the SSO Service at the IdP (SAML 2.0 only): The user agent issues a GET request to the SSO service at the URL from step 2. The SSO service processes the codice_4 (sent via the codice_1 URL query parameter) and performs a security check. If the user does not have a valid security context, the identity provider identifies the user (details omitted).
; 4. Respond with an XHTML form: The SSO service validates the request and responds with a document containing an XHTML form: 
 &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;https://sp.example.com/SAML2/SSO/POST&quot; ...&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;SAMLResponse&quot; value=&quot;response&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
 The value of the codice_6 element (denoted by the placeholder codice_7 above) is the base64 encoding of a codice_8 element.
; 5. Request the Assertion Consumer Service at the SP: The user agent issues a POST request to the assertion consumer service at the service provider. The value of the codice_6 parameter is taken from the XHTML form at step 4.
; 6. Redirect to the target resource: The assertion consumer service processes the response, creates a security context at the service provider and redirects the user agent to the target resource.
; 7. Request the target resource at the SP again: The user agent requests the target resource at the service provider (again): 
; 8. Respond with requested resource: Since a security context exists, the service provider returns the resource to the user agent.

In SAML 1.1, the flow begins with a request to the identity provider&#x27;s inter-site transfer service at step 3.

In the example flow above, all depicted exchanges are &quot;front-channel exchanges&quot;, that is, an HTTP user agent (browser) communicates with a SAML entity at each step. In particular, there are no &quot;back-channel exchanges&quot; or direct communications between the service provider and the identity provider. Front-channel exchanges lead to simple protocol flows where all messages are passed &quot;by value&quot; using a simple HTTP binding (GET or POST). Indeed, the flow outlined in the previous section is sometimes called the &quot;Lightweight Web Browser SSO Profile&quot;.

Alternatively, for increased security or privacy, messages may be passed &quot;by reference&quot;. For example, an identity provider may supply a reference to a SAML assertion (called an &quot;artifact&quot;) instead of transmitting the assertion directly through the user agent. Subsequently, the service provider requests the actual assertion via a back channel. Such a back-channel exchange is specified as a SOAP message exchange (SAML over SOAP over HTTP). In general, any SAML exchange over a secure back channel is conducted as a SOAP message exchange.

On the back channel, SAML specifies the use of SOAP 1.1. The use of SOAP as a binding mechanism is optional, however. Any given SAML deployment will choose whatever bindings are appropriate.

<text>Sir Edward Brantwood Maufe, RA, FRIBA (12 December 1882 – 12 December 1974) was an English architect and designer. He built private homes as well as commercial and institutional buildings, and is remembered chiefly for his work on places of worship and memorials. Perhaps his best known buildings are Guildford Cathedral and the Air Forces Memorial. He was a recipient of the Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1944 and, in 1954, received a knighthood for services to the Imperial War Graves Commission, with which he was associated from 1943 until his death.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Maufe was born Edward Muff in Sunny Bank, Ilkley, Yorkshire, on 12 December 1882. He was the second of three children and the youngest son of Henry Muff and Maude Alice Muff Smithies. Henry Muff was a linen draper who was part owner of Brown Muff &amp; Co a department store in Bradford, “the Harrods of the North”. Maude was the niece of Titus Salt, the founder of Saltaire. Maufe started his education at Wharfedale School in Ilkley, and later attended Bradford School.


During his adolescent years, Maufe became interested in architecture. In 1899 he was sent to London to serve a five-year apprenticeship under the direction of the architect William A. Pite, brother of Arthur Beresford Pite. Soon after, the Muff family moved from Yorkshire to Red House in Bexleyheath. The house was designed by Philip Webb for William Morris; Maufe later acknowledged the design as an early architectural influence. After completing his apprenticeship in 1904, Maufe attended St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where, in 1908, he received a B.A.; he also studied design at the Architectural Association School of Architecture.

In 1909 the Muff family name was changed by deed poll to Maufe by Henry and his brothers, Charles and Frederick, &quot;for ourselves and our respective issue&quot;. The deed poll stated that they were &quot;desirous of reverting to the old form of our surname&quot;. The following year Maufe, then aged 28, moved to 139 Old Church Street, Chelsea, London. On 1 October 1910, he married Prudence Stutchbury (1882–1976), the daughter of Edward Stutchbury of the Geological Survey of India. She was an interior designer and later a director of Heal&#x27;s. They had a son who died in 1968.

During the First World War Maufe served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, before joining the army in 1917 with Dick Sheppard, who acted as his guarantor. Maufe enlisted in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 9 January 1917, was commissioned as a staff lieutenant that April, and saw action in Salonika. He was discharged on 26 February 1919. Having already been an associate member since 1910, Maufe was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1920. 

In 1940 Maufe commissioned his portrait, which is now housed at the RIBA. The picture shows him in front of his winning design for Guildford Cathedral from Gluck, whose studio in Hampstead he had designed in 1932.

Another oil portrait of him by John Laviers Wheatley (1892-1955) was exhibited in 1956 and is in the Primary Collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.

==Architecture==
Maufe&#x27;s first important commission after establishing his own practice was in 1912, the design of Kelling Hall, Norfolk, for Sir Henry Deterding. The building shows Maufe&#x27;s early links with the arts and crafts movement due to its butterfly plan, knapped flint walls, and a grey tiled and gabled roof. Maufe&#x27;s other pre-war work included the decoration of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the chapels and alterations at All Saints&#x27; Church, Southampton (destroyed in the Southampton Blitz in 1940), and restoration at St John&#x27;s, Hackney, which first brought him into notice in church circles.

Whilst Kelling Hall was Maufe&#x27;s first major project. Prior to this in 1909 he was commissioned by Marie Studholme (the Edwardian Music Hall Star) to design a weekend house on the banks of the River Thames in Laleham, Middlesex. The house, known as The Barn, was heavily influenced by Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s Homewood (1901), in particular the triple gabled roof, a device he used at Kelling Hall as well.

His 1924 proposals for the Palace of Industry at the British Empire Exhibition, Wembley attracted notice though an alternative design was built. Maufe was a silver medallist at the Paris Exhibition in 1925 which resulted in him securing a wide variety of commissions. The church of St Bede Clapham (1922) and St Saviour&#x27;s in Acton (1924), were built for the Royal Association in Aid of the Deaf and Dumb and made. The latter church displays a simple structure and has a likeness to contemporary Swedish architecture. St Saviour&#x27;s was loosely based on the design by Ivar Tengbom of Högalid Church in Stockholm, which Maufe described as being the most completely satisfying modern Swedish building he had seen. During this period, Maufe was a constant champion of modern Swedish architecture, and was often vocal on this theme in the architectural press, citing his own buildings as having simplified elevations, painted ceilings, and applied sculpture, similar to those found in Sweden. Maufe felt that Swedish architecture had a combined freshness without obviously breaking with tradition.

In 1932, Maufe won a competition to design the Guildford Cathedral, coming first among 183 entries with a Gothic design in concrete faced in brick. By the time the building was dedicated in 1961, it seemed even more of an anachronism. The cathedral&#x27;s exterior including the nave and aisles together with Maufe&#x27;s use of space, won him general admiration amongst fellow architects. As a result, he was described as a designer of churches by conviction, as he attempted to produce buildings of austere simplicity aiming directly at the creation of a religious atmosphere. At Guildford, he wanted to produce a design of the times, yet to keep in line with the great English cathedrals already established within the United Kingdom.

In 1936, King George VI commissioned Maufe to conduct various alterations to the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park. The small private chapel stands in the grounds of Royal Lodge which was the Queen Mother&#x27;s residence. Maufe designed a new ceiling for the chancel and a royal pew, new choir stalls and a casing for a new organ. In 1937, Maufe designed the extension to Heal&#x27;s furniture store in Tottenham Court Road, where his wife Prudence worked, with his design including a full length Lenscrete Window inspired by his design for Guildford Cathedral. In 1944, he was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for architecture.
From 1943, Maufe was principal architect UK to the Imperial War Graves Commission, eventually becoming chief architect and artistic adviser until 1969. Among his war memorial designs are those at Tower Hill which was an expansion to the already established memorial by Sir Edward Lutyens and the Air Forces Memorial at Cooper&#x27;s Hill overlooking Runnymede (1950–53). Maufe&#x27;s domestic work had a stylish modernity, in direct contrast with the new functionalism. In the architectural language of the time it was called ‘modernity with manners’ and very much reflected the established taste of the inter-war period. Maufe often wrote and lectured on architecture chiefly on furnishing within the home and on present-day architecture. His designs were considered by interior designers to be modern and stylish, with built-in fitments and pastel colour-schemes, particularly pink, mauve, and cream, contrasted with silver-lacquered furniture and mirrors. One of his house designs was Yaffle Hill, Broadstone, Dorset, built in 1929 for Cyril Carter of Poole Pottery. Other schemes included an extension to Baylins, Beaconsfield in 1927, for Ambrose Heal, Gluck&#x27;s studio in Bolton Hill, Hampstead (1932), and the studio for religious services at Broadcasting House (1931). He also designed several branch banks for Lloyds Bank, including 50 Notting Hill Gate, London in 1930.

Other works include the Festival Theatre in Cambridge, St Thomas the Apostle in Hanwell, London and the Oxford Playhouse and St Columba&#x27;s Church (Pont Street, London SW1). He designed buildings for Trinity and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Balliol and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford (of which he was made an honorary fellow of in 1943). Maufe was later commissioned to re-design the war-damaged Middle Temple, Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn, which made him an Honorary Master of the Bench in 1951.

Architectural historian Ian Nairn said that &quot;Maufe is the rare case of a man with genuine spatial gifts but out of sympathy with the style of his time&quot;.

===Retirement and death===
Maufe retired in 1964 to Shepherd&#x27;s Hill, Buxted, East Sussex, which he had restored as his second home in the late 1920s. He died aged 92 on his birthday, 12 December 1974, in nearby Uckfield Hospital. His architectural drawings and correspondence were deposited at the RIBA upon his death.

<text>The genealogy of musical genres is the pattern of musical genres that have contributed to the development of new genres. Evolution in musical instruments
in technology and in culture can influence the evolution of musical genres.

Genealogical charts or family trees of musical genres show how new genres have emerged from existing genres and how multiple genres have contributed to a new genre. Since music can be endlessly broken down into smaller and smaller categories, a genealogical chart will usually focus on one major genre and its different strains. How these developed out of one another is shown in a genealogical chart, often with major figures or innovators of each subgenre.

A simplified example appears below.

<text>Fire support is a military term used to describe weapons fire used to support friendly forces by engaging, suppressing, or destroying enemy forces, facilities, or materiel in combat. It is often provided through indirect fire, though the term may also be used for some forms of supporting direct fire.

The United States Department of Defense defines fire support as &quot;fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces to engage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives.&quot;

== Overview ==

Fire support generally consists of fire from heavy or crew-served weaponry with high firepower, including strikes and barrages from artillery, mortars, rocket artillery, and missiles; naval gunfire support from naval artillery; airstrikes, strafes, and close air support from military aircraft; and drone strikes from unmanned combat aerial vehicles; among various other forms. Fire support is typically ordered and directed by an observer (e.g. artillery observer, forward air controller, etc.) on the front line, and provided by a weapon crew or operator in the rear, usually from a fortification, vehicle, or facility (such as a fire support base).

Fire support is used to support and supplement military units that may lack the capabilities or firepower offered by fire support. For example, an infantry unit needing heavy explosives to bombard an enemy emplacement, or a large smoke screen to cover their advance, and lacking the ability to do so themselves (e.g. insufficient effectiveness using grenades), may call for fire support from a capable nearby mortar unit.

Fire support can reduce friendly casualties whilst devastating enemy capabilities and morale. Effective use of fire support—as seen during the 2018 Battle of Khasham of the Syrian Civil War, where an outnumbered force used various forms of fire support to their advantage, avoiding serious casualties—may help swing a battle in one&#x27;s favor.

== History ==

Varying forms of fire support have existed since the advent of early cannons and rockets, which were used to bombard enemy positions and fortifications to support infantry. Warships have long provided fire support using their cannons. The use of fire support in its current form developed during World War I and World War II, when combined arms and advances in technology and tactics made fire support increasingly effective.
==Definition==
Fire support is defined as &quot;assistance to infantry and armored units by artillery fire, naval gunfire, and airplane strafing and bombing.&quot;

==Early cannons (1300-1599)==
Early versions of artillery included the Roman ballista, essentially a large, mounted version of a crossbow that fired a single arrow. The first documented use of bombards, (large mortars) in Europe as we know them today was at the siege of Algeciras in 1343. By the 1470s, casting and metal work dramatically improved, giving way to the modern cannon. In the early 15th century, cast iron balls were invented for cannons. These balls, combined with gunpowder, were commonly used during sieges. By around 1550, the French had begun categorizing their guns by caliber, leading to a more organized formation of artillery.

==Renaissance and revolutionary cannons (1600-1790)==
Circa 1650, the French garrison gun was invented. The garrison gun was usually mounted and tied down to reduce recoil, and could be mounted in very small spaces. By the mid-18th century artillery pieces were making an appearance in North America, most notably during the French and Indian War. Artillery was later used by the Americans in their war for independence. The Continental Army used cannons captured at Fort Ticonderoga to win the Battle of Yorktown, the last major battle of the American Revolution.

==Fire support during World War I and World War II (1914-1945)==
During the first World War, fire support was mostly used preemptively before an infantry attack. Artillery was often used to destroy enemy forces and positions, as well as obstacles in and near trenches. During this time, we also see the introduction of chemical fire support, using chemical compounds inside of shells in addition to conventional armaments. During the second World War, there was a joint usage of fire support by field artillery, naval fire support and air support. Field artillery was mainly in the western and eastern theaters, while naval fire support was used during the pacific theater, however a large number of ships were used to give fire support on D-Day. During World War II there was a large use of aerial fire support that included major improvements in technology in all theaters and campaigns of the second world war.

==Fire support in Vietnam (1955–1974)==
During the Vietnam War, fire support was used to flush out Viet Cong positions. Most notably, napalm was used to destroy forests and jungles, resulting in less cover for the enemy.

==Fire support in recent warfare (since 1975)==
During Operation Desert Storm the United States used fire support, particularly onboard naval craft to bombard positions. During this operation, we also see the introduction of drones into combat, as a way to provide fire support from the air without a manned aircraft. During Operation Desert storm, Artillery was used to achieve a decisive victory by coalition forces. More recently Artillery has been used in the Russo-Ukrainian war to bombard troops and key positions. When the war first broke out, the United States sent artillery aid including shells, cannons and Patriot missile defense systems to aid Ukraine. As of 2023, Fire support by tanks and artillery have been used by the Israeli Defense Force to bombard key positions in the war against Hamas.

<doc id="973917" wikidata="Q1235788" url="?curid=973917" title="My Ishmael">
<text>My Ishmael is a 1997 novel by Daniel Quinn that is a sequel to &quot;Ishmael&quot;. With its time frame largely simultaneous with &quot;Ishmael&quot;, its plot precedes the fictional events of its 1996 spiritual successor, &quot;The Story of B&quot;. Like &quot;Ishmael&quot;, &quot;My Ishmael&quot; largely revolves around a Socratic dialogue between the sapient gorilla, Ishmael, and a student, involving his philosophy regarding tribal society. Ishmael&#x27;s pupil in &quot;My Ishmael&quot; is a twelve-year-old female protagonist, Julie Gerchak. The plot details her visits to Ishmael and her journey to Africa to prepare for Ishmael&#x27;s return to his homeland.

==Summary==
===Background===
&quot;My Ishmael&quot; is presented as the final copy of a book published by Julie Gerchak, who has herself read the book &quot;Ishmael&quot;. At the time she begins writing, Julie is sixteen; however, during the main plot of her story, she is merely twelve years old: &quot;a plucky, resourceful, near-genius with a wobbly home life&quot;. Like the narrator of &quot;Ishmael&quot;, Julie discovers a newspaper advertisement from a teacher seeking a student who wishes to save the world. Julie discovers that the teacher is a gorilla, Ishmael, with whom she can communicate telepathically. When she asks Ishmael if he will teach her, he is initially ambivalent due to her very young age, though her skillful arguments convince him that she may indeed be open to his maieutic teaching style.

===Plot===
The novel mostly proceeds as a dialogue between Julie and Ishmael. Julie has come to Ishmael in search of a teacher due to anxiety about civilization&#x27;s destructive impact on human well-being and the environment. She recounts a daydream of being recruited to go on a space mission to visit other planets and thereby learn solutions around the galaxy for Earth&#x27;s many problems. Julie and Ishmael discuss a variety of topics, including the hidden mythology that drives our modern industrial and agricultural civilization, which disparages the foraging lifestyle of other societies; the evolution of humans by natural selection; the rise of social hierarchies; and the differing values between traditional foraging societies versus modern civilization. Julie ultimately learns she does not need to travel around the galaxy to find solutions. Instead, Ishmael directs her to think about how historical and present-day evidence demonstrate the successes of indigenous tribal communities.

Julie visits Ishmael as often as possible and notices a man sometimes leaving Ishmael&#x27;s office: Alan Lomax (later revealed as the previously unnamed narrator of &quot;Ishmael&quot;). Julie feels an odd distaste for Alan, although she has never met him face-to-face. Ishmael maintains both pupils, though his teachings are not necessarily the same for each. With Julie, Ishmael discusses how human communities living in the wild compete but do not go as far as war, which is largely an invention of modern civilization. He also discusses how major social institutions like law and education operate differently and more effectively in forager societies.

Julie eventually meets Art &quot;Artie&quot; Owens, born in the Belgian Congo (later Zaire), a friend of Ishmael who intends to help him return to the West African jungle. Owens is a lifelong naturalist who grew up with Mokonzi Nkemi, the president of the Republic of Mali, a nation that has recently gained independence from Zaire. Owens, meanwhile, became a dual citizen of Zaire and Belgium, traveling to the United States and attending Cornell University, where he met a student who introduced him to Ishmael. Later, in Zaire, Owens helped the revolution that founded Mabili and became its interior minister for only a few months before he realized Nkemi&#x27;s corrupt dealings with Zaire&#x27;s President Mobutu. Exiled from Mabili, Owens fled back to the U.S. and purchased an animal menagerie, where he plans to house Ishmael for his last days in the U.S.

Ishmael and Owens now ask Julie to attain President Nkemi&#x27;s permission to return Ishmael to the Mabili wilderness. Julie is astounded at first, initially wondering if they should ask Alan Lomax for help instead, but they deem Alan untrustworthy. She finally agrees to the potentially dangerous five-day trip and is drilled on how to act and be wary in African cities, including conversing with Mabili&#x27;s leaders. In Mabili, Julie poses as a student who has won an essay-writing contest promising her a trip to meet Mabili&#x27;s president. Upon meeting Nkemi, Julie claims that Ishmael is a gorilla who has gathered an American following of supporters who wish to see him successfully released back into the wild. When Nkemi asks why he should help her, she charms him with a parable asserting that they are bringing back to the land a beloved creature that was once lost.

Back in the U.S., Julie hears from Owens that Ishmael has completed the journey back to Africa. She also learns why Alan Lomax was not trusted with this mission: he was becoming too attached to Ishmael as his teacher. With this in mind, Alan is told that Ishmael has died. Such a ploy is regarded as successful since it motivates Alan to write the book &quot;Ishmael&quot; in 1992. Though Julie wishes to publish her book, this very story, Owens forbids her from doing so until Mobutu&#x27;s regime (and with it, Nkemi&#x27;s) is on the verge of collapse since the book might put Ishmael in danger by revealing to the authorities that he is still alive. However, in 1997 (when Julie is eighteen years old), Owens finally contacts Julie, telling her that Mobutu&#x27;s days are numbered and she may publish &quot;My Ishmael&quot; at last.

==Ideas and themes==
===Takers and Leavers===
Ishmael launches into a discussion of &quot;Mother Culture&quot;, the personification of the often hidden influences of our culture on our lives, behavior, and worldview. He expounds upon civilization&#x27;s delusion that human intelligence is a curse inherently propelling us toward making terrible decisions and our culture&#x27;s fallacy that all human societies (or, at least, all the &quot;civilized&quot; ones) developed from foraging to a superior state of farming, neglecting the tribes all over the world who continue the foraging lifestyle. Ishmael refers to humanity in terms of &quot;Takers&quot; (members of the dominant globalized culture that destroys other peoples or forces them to assimilate) and Leavers (members of the countless cultures who lived or continue to live in tribal societies). He also examines evolutionary processes and how they tend to maintain behaviors that best sustain some particular gene pool and enforce a sort of equilibrium in which no single organism or group of organisms overwhelms the competition for resources in the biological community. He claims that Takers depart from this self-sustaining balance by keeping their resources, primarily food, under &quot;lock and key.&quot; This, he claims, creates hierarchical social structures that, abandoning the cooperating ethos of Leavers, result in distress and conflict &quot;within&quot; the society, such as crime, suicide, poverty, famine, and senseless violence. He argues that although Taker societies flourish in terms of material wealth – such as technological advancement and greater scientific progress – they fail utterly with regard to what he believes to be actual wealth: the sense of belonging and security that hold together the fabric of human tribal societies.

===Competition and war===
Ishmael describes how tribes live alongside other tribes in a state of &quot;erratic retaliation&quot;, meaning that they avenge their neighbors&#x27; acts of aggression but do not behave too predictably. This allows people to compete effectively for resources without engaging &quot;in mortal combat for every little thing&quot;. Furthermore, Ishmael distinguishes erratic retaliation from war, a feature of Taker societies, which he describes thus: &quot;Retaliation is giving as good as you get; going to war is conquering people to make them do what you want&quot;. Ishmael also outlines his preference for the Leaver (or tribal) notion of law, which is generally unwritten knowledge of how to deal with undesirable behaviors within the tribe. He explains that this is different from the Taker concept of law because since &quot;tribal peoples didn&#x27;t waste time with laws they knew would be disobeyed, disobedience was not a problem for them. Tribal law didn&#x27;t outlaw mischief. It spelled out ways to &quot;undo&quot; mischief, so people were glad to obey it&quot;.

===Education===
Eventually, Ishmael&#x27;s teachings turn toward the subject of formal education, which he argues is merely a way to keep children out of the work force and is otherwise unnecessary because humans learn on their own, naturally following their own interests and picking up information necessary to operate in their culture. In tribal cultures, this information inherently includes that which is relevant to surviving in the wild by learning to hunt and gather food, as well as easily adopting their culture&#x27;s values, customs, and so on. In Taker culture, the otherwise automatic process of learning is hindered and convoluted by the institution of formal education, which largely forces students to study abstract topics that they do not directly apply outside of the classroom and that they therefore largely forget once the information is no longer required to pass tests or other evaluations.

===Inspiration and innovation===
When Ishmael asserts that humans must strive to belong to functional and secure communities, Julie asks for concrete examples of how this can be achieved. Ishmael praises the utter strength of human innovation, citing positive examples from the Industrial Revolution and claims that this will lead, and has already led, to a diversity of new models, including the Sudbury school, the Gesundheit! Institute, and intentional communities. He claims that humans must together create these answers little by little and that innovators in fact gradually build upon prior ideas toward eventual progress. He concludes his teachings with an iteration of his philosophy summed up in a single sentence: &quot;There is no one right way for people to live&quot;.

==Influence==
Tosin Abasi, founder of rock band Animals as Leaders in 2008, claims that &quot;My Ishmael&quot; was an inspiration for the band&#x27;s name.

This book was mentioned by James Lee in his list of demands when he took several hostages at the Discovery Channel Headquarters on September 1, 2010. He demanded the network air daily programs based on the book, specifically content found on pages 207 through 212 (the chapter &quot;Revolutionaries&quot;). Quinn regarded Lee as &quot;a fanatic&quot; who warped his ideas.

<text>HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; was a fifth-rate 32-gun sailing frigate of the British Royal Navy that George Parsons built at Bursledon and launched in 1794. Before she was broken up in 1809 she captured numerous prizes and participated in a number of actions, first in the Channel and off Ireland (1794–1803), and then in the Caribbean (1802–1809), including one that earned her crew the Naval General Service Medal.

==Service history==

===Channel Fleet, 1794–1803===
&quot;Galatea&quot; was commissioned in May 1794 under the command of Captain Richard Goodwin Keats. She then joined the Channel Squadrons under Sir Edward Pellew and Sir John Borlase Warren.

&quot;Galatea&quot; took part in the capture or destruction of a number of French warships. On 23 August, the squadron ran the French ships &quot;Volontaire&quot;, &quot;Espion&quot;, and &quot;Alerte&quot; on to the shore along the coast of France and destroyed them.

&quot;Galatea&quot;, , , and shared in the capture of the French cutter &quot;Quartidi&quot; on 7 September. They also shared in the recapture of the Swedish brig &quot;Haesingeland&quot; on 16 September.

&quot;Galatea&quot; was among the vessels in sight when &quot;Artois&quot; captured the frigate of 40 guns and 370 men at the action of 21 October 1794. She was on her first cruise, barely a week out of LeHavre. Prize money exceeded £16,000. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS &quot;Revolutionaire&quot;.

From January into February &quot;Galatea&quot; was under the temporary command of Captain F. Cole. On 31 January 1795, the squadron captured the Dutch East India Ship &quot;Ostenhuyson&quot;.

Between 13 and 26 February 1795, the squadron under Captain Sir John Borlase Warren in , captured nine vessels off the Île de Groix, near Lorient:
*Sloop &quot;Petit Jean&quot;;
*Brig &quot;St. Pierre&quot;;
*Brig &quot;Deux Frères&quot;;
*Ship &quot;Petite Magalène&quot;;
*Pacquet boat &quot;De Cayenne&quot;;
*Schooner &quot;Curieuse&quot; (name latter corrected to &quot;Coureuse&quot;; she was a vessel belonging to the National Convention government), of eight brass guns;
*Lugger &quot;Liberté&quot;;
*Lugger &quot;Gloire&quot;; and
*Brig transport &quot;Biche&quot; (National Convention).
The squadron also burnt seven vessels and scuttled four. In his letter listing the vessels, Warren particularly thanked Keats for his efforts.

&quot;Coureuse&quot;, American-built, was escorting this convoy from Brest to Nantz with clothing for the army. The frigates &quot;Artois&quot;, &quot;Galatea&quot; and , and the hired armed lugger &quot;Duke of York&quot; assisted &quot;Pomone&quot; in the capture. The British latter scuttled two more of the brigs that were of little value, but took the other four vessels as prizes, with being taken into service briefly as a dispatch vessel in the Mediterranean.

&quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Anson&quot;, &quot;Artois&quot; and &quot;Pomone&quot; shared in the capture of &quot;Jean Amie&quot;, &quot;François Bernard&quot; and &quot;Lune&quot; on 15 and 27 February 1795. Between 13 February and 2 March, the same four British ships shared in the capture of the &quot;Petit Jean&quot;, &quot;Adélaïde&quot;, and &quot;Aimalie&quot;.

Then &quot;Galatea&quot; took the ship-corvette &quot;Expédition&quot; on 16 April 1795. &quot;Expédition&quot;, of 16 guns and 110 men, was formerly a British packet. She was part of a convoy that Pellew&#x27;s squadron had chased and was one of several small vessels they captured that day.

&quot;Galatea&quot; participated in the unsuccessful invasion of France at Quiberon Bay between 23 June and 21 July. She therefore was among the myriad vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Rachel&quot; on 1 and 4 July 1795. &quot;Galatea&quot; was also among the vessels of Pellew&#x27;s squadron that shared in the recapture, on 9 October, of the ship &quot;Kent&quot;.

&quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Artois&quot;, &quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Pomone&quot;, which was under the command of Sir John Borlase Warren, who commanded the squadron, attacked a French convoy of some 60 vessels, including its escort of four frigates, a corvette, the armed store ship &quot;Étoile&quot; and a gun-brig, on 20 March 1796. The British captured &quot;Étoile&quot;, which was under the command of &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot; Mathurin-Théodore Berthelin. She was armed with thirty 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 160 men. The British also captured a ship and four brigs belonging to the convoy. In the engagement &quot;Galatea&quot; lost two men killed and six wounded and her losses represented the only British casualties. In his letter, Sir John exaggerated the French strength; actually the British outgunned them.

On 29 March &quot;Galatea&quot; recaptured the ship &quot;Fortitude&quot;. Then &quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Pomone&quot;, &quot;Artois&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; shared in the capture of several vessels.
*&quot;América&quot; (6 April);
*&quot;Jean Marie&quot; (18 April);
*French ship &quot;Robuste&quot; (26 April):
*&quot;Pacific&quot; (14 May);
*&quot;Pacific&quot; (22 May);
*&quot;Friendschap&quot; (25 May).
*&quot;Fantaisie&quot; (25 May);
Then &quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Pomone&quot;, &quot;Artois&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; shared in the capture of the chasse marees &quot;Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Véronique&quot; on 16 August. Six days later, the same four vessels plus the lugger &quot;Argus&quot; captured the &quot;Jonge Duisse&quot;.

On 23 August 1796 the squadron was cruising near the Garonne when a French frigate hove in sight. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the navigation in shoal waters Captain Richard Goodwin Keats and &quot;Galatea&quot; pursued the frigate. The French pilot on board declared himself incapable of piloting the ship in the shoal waters, but Keats persevered taking responsibility for conning his ship and chased the enemy through the night in squally winds, rain and lightning, passing between the Chevrier bank and the lighthouse before making all sail in pursuit right over the shoals of Arcachon on which the French frigate struck and was immediately wrecked. In the morning they were joined by the &#x27; &#x27;Artois&#x27; &#x27; and &quot;Sylph&quot;. Boats from &quot;Artois&quot; and &quot;Galatea&quot; were sent with a boarding party. The frigate turned out to be the &quot;Andromaque&quot;, of forty-four 12-pounder guns (though pierced for 48), most of which her crew thrown overboard. She had a crew of 300 men, many of whom jumped overboard and who drowned in their attempt to reach the shore. The boarding party took prisoner &quot;Andromaque″&quot;s captain and officers, and rescued a number of Portuguese prisoners who had been the crews of two Brazilian ships that her squadron had captured. A boarding party from &quot;Sylph&quot; fired into her bottom to prevent re-floating and set fire to &quot;Andromaque&quot; as they left; she was completely burnt.

Shortly after this encounter the squadron returned to Falmouth on Admiralty orders to reinforce the squadrons off Brest. such was the widespread public expectation that the gallant western frigate squadron would continue its well publicised harassment of the enemy the admiralty wrote they were &#x27;intending by and by to release you from the fleet and send you cruising again on your old ground.&quot; 
Next, &quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Pomone&quot;, &quot;Artois&quot; and &quot;Anson&quot; shared in the capture of even more vessels:
*Brig (name unknown), chasse marees &quot;Maria Theresa&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; (11 December);
*Spanish brig recaptured (14 December); and
*Spanish brig &quot;Divina Pastora&quot; (17 December);

Also in 1796, &quot;Galatea&quot;, as a member of the fleet under Admiral Colpoys, shared in the capture of the privateer &quot;Franklin&quot;. On 19 November, &quot;Galatea&quot; was among the vessels that shared in the capture of the &quot;Bergen&quot;.

&quot;Pomone&quot;, &quot;Galatea&quot;, &quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Artois&quot; recaptured the whaler &quot;Mary South&quot; on 25 April 1797. On 15 May, &quot;Pomone&quot;, &quot;Galatea&quot; and &quot;Artois&quot; detained the &quot;Count Bernstoff&quot;.

A month and a half later, on 30 June 1797, Captain George Byng had assumed command of &quot;Galatea&quot; and was her captain when she captured the privateer lugger &quot;Argonaute&quot; off Cape Clear. &quot;Argonaute&quot; was armed with two brass 6-pounder guns and ten swivel guns. She had a crew of 36 men and was 14 days out of Granville but had not taken any prizes.

On 15 July, took the 22-gun privateer &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;. &quot;Galatea&quot; shared in the capture.

On 19 July, &quot;Doris&quot; and &quot;Galatea&quot; recaptured the Portuguese ship &quot;Nostra Senora de Patrocinio e Santa Anna&quot;. At some point they also recaptured the Portuguese ship &quot;Nostra Senora de Conceiçao e Navigantes&quot;.

A little over a month later, on 22 August 1797 &quot;Galatea&quot; recaptured the brig &quot;Friends Adventure&quot;. Then on 6 November she captured the 14-gun &quot;Venturier&quot;, the former . There being a already in service, when the Royal Navy took &quot;Galatea″&quot;s prize into back into service they gave her the name HMS &quot;Venturer&quot;.

In 1799, &quot;Galatea&quot; was stationed off Southern Ireland. On 26 December she was in company with &quot;Loire&quot; when they captured the American ship &quot;Favorite&quot;.

In January 1800 &quot;Galatea&quot; escorted a convoy from Cork through the Channel to the Downs. On a stormy night, Lieutenant Donald Campbell and six men took a boat to take possession of a Spanish letter of marque that &quot;Galatea&quot; had caught. Because of the weather it took them an hour to get to her and then as they boarded her waves stove in their boat. Still, the seven men took control of &quot;Pensée&quot; and her 20-man crew. However, for the next ten days the weather blocked Campbell from contact with &quot;Galatea&quot;. Campbell therefore had to navigate &quot;Pensée&quot; while keeping control of a group of prisoners that outnumbered his men by almost three to one. This feat and his good service record led to Lieutenant Campbell being promoted to first lieutenant of in 1802 or 1803.

On 3 January 1801, &quot;Galatea&quot; escorted &quot;Hibernia&quot; into Plymouth from Belfast. &quot;Hibernia&quot; was a linen ship worth £100,000, and was carrying as a passenger Mr. J. Dalway, Member of Parliament from Belfast. On their way the two vessels encountered very bad weather off the Isles of Scilly.

On 21 April 1801 &quot;Galatea&quot; recaptured &quot;Kenyon&quot;. &quot;Kenyon&quot; had been en route from Jamaica to Liverpool with a cargo worth £40,000, when the French captured her. recaptured &quot;Kenyon&quot; and the three other prizes, which the French again captured. After re-recapturing &quot;Kenyon&quot;, &quot;Galatea&quot; searched for the other three; there is no report of her having recaptured them, so she was apparently unable to find them.

After this, Captain George Wolfe assumed command, having been appointed in April 1801. On 1 July &quot;Galatea&quot; came into Plymouth after a cruise of 18 weeks in the Atlantic and off the western islands. Then during October and November she was on a 28-day cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Here she not only endured fifteen severe gales, but on 1 and 2 November she nearly foundered. Hurricane-force winds sent her mizzen mast and the main and foretop masts over the side, even though she had no sails set. Furthermore, when the mizzen mast went it took one seaman to go overboard with it and severely injured others. When the winds died down on 3 November, Byng sailed &quot;Galatea&quot; for Cork. There he jury rigged a mizzen-mast, main, and foretop-mast. &quot;Galatea&quot; finally reached Plymouth on 22 November.
She spent the first quarter of 1802 sailing between Cork and Plymouth and was paid off on 28 April 1802. On 30 July she sailed in company with and for the Isle of Wight. There they were to pick up Dutch troops to return to Holland.

&quot;Galatea&quot; and several other frigates then returned to Plymouth from Den Helder on 3 September. On 14 September she sailed for Spithead carrying discharged seamen. She then returned discharged marines to Plymouth. Subsequently, she cruised on patrols looking for smugglers.

In April 1803 Captain Henry Heathcote assumed command while &quot;Galatea&quot; was being fitted out at Portsmouth. On 8 July she sailed to take up position as guardship off The Needles.

===Caribbean, 1804–1809===
In February 1804 &quot;Galatea&quot; sailed to the West Indies as escort to a convoy of merchant vessels. On 19 May she recaptured , which was carrying plantation stores. A month later, on 25 June, she recaptured the English ship , which was carrying a cargo of slaves and ivory.

On 3 August the French privateer schooner &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, of six guns, arrived at Dominica. &quot;Galatea&quot; had cut her out at Guadeloupe.

The next attempt to cut out a French vessel went badly. On 14 August &quot;Galatea&quot; attempted to cut out the French privateer &quot;Général Ernouf&quot;, which had been the British sloop-of-war &quot;Lilly&quot;. &quot;Général Ernouf&quot; was sheltering at the Saintes near Guadeloupe where shore batteries could protect her. The attack was a debacle for the British, who failed completely in their attempt. Captain Heathcote had been too obvious in his reconnoitering and the French were waiting for the night attack. In all, the British lost some 10 men killed, including Lieutenant Charles Hayman, the commander of the boarding party, and first lieutenant of &quot;Galatea&quot;, and 55 or more wounded or captured. The French lost four killed and suffered some wounded, among them Captain Lapointe, commander of &quot;Général Ernouf&quot;, and Lieutenant Mouret, commander of the detachment of troops the French stationed aboard her in anticipation of the attack. The French also captured &quot;Galatea″&quot;s barge, which the other three boats of the cutting out party could not retrieve as they made their escape.

On 18 September &quot;Galatea&quot; captured &quot;Mercury&quot;.

In July 1805 &quot;Galatea&quot; came under the command of Captain Murray Maxwell at Jamaica. By September &quot;Galatea&quot; was under the command of Captain George Sayer. On 11 September she shared with , &quot;Africaine&quot;, , , and the schooner in the proceeds of the capture of the brig &quot;Hiram&quot; .

In February 1806 &quot;Galatea&quot; recaptured the merchantman , which a French privateer had captured as &quot;Shipley&quot; was sailing to Dominica. &quot;Galatea&quot; sent &quot;Shipley&quot; into Barbados. The French privateer was the former Royal Navy schooner .

On 18 August 1806 Lieutenant M&#x27;Culloch used &quot;Galatea″&quot;s barge to pursue a schooner several miles up a river near Puerto Cabello, Venezuela. The schooner resisted the boarding party until she lost her commander and a crew member, at which time she surrendered. She proved to be a Spanish privateer with three long 6 and 4-pounder guns, some swivel guns, and musketoons. M&#x27;Culloch blew her up as he could not safely bring her out. He did return with the prisoners. &quot;Galatea&quot; suffered one man wounded in the affair.

Three days later &quot;Galatea&quot;″s boats under Lieutenant Walker captured a small Spanish privateer armed with swivel guns and small arms. Her crew, however, escaped; Walker had her destroyed.

Then between 9 and 11 October a cutting-out party in three boats under the command of Richard Gittins, the first lieutenant, brought out four Spanish schooners that were sheltering under three batteries at Barcelona (Colombia). Although the cutting-out party was under fire from the batteries for one and a half hours, it suffered no casualties.

Off Guadeloupe on the morning of 12 November 1806 &quot;Galatea&quot; sailed after a strange sail. After a pursuit of a few hours &quot;Galatea&quot; was able, once the seas were calm enough, to dispatch a boarding party. The schooner&#x27;s crew resisted slightly, but she struck just before the boarding party came on board. The schooner was the &quot;Réunion&quot;, bound for Martinique from La Guaira with cargo and dispatches from the Spanish government at Caracas to the French commander at Martinique. &quot;Réunion&quot; was pierced for 14 guns but was armed with ten.

====&quot;Galatea&quot; captures &quot;Lynx&quot;====
On 3 January 1807 &quot;Galatea&quot; captured a schooner.

On the morning of 21 January 1807 &quot;Galatea&quot; was off the coast of Venezuela when she sighted a sail steering for La Guaira. &quot;Galatea&quot; approached and identified the vessel as a man-of-war; she then change her course, heading for Barcelona, Anzoátegui, which lay some 160 miles to the east. By noon &quot;Galatea&quot; was becalmed; at the same time a slight breeze enabled &quot;Galatea″&quot;s quarry to continue on her way. Two hours later lookouts could barely see her highest sails above the horizon.

&quot;Galatea&quot; sent her boats under the command of her first lieutenant William Coombe, together with Lieutenants Harry Walker and Robert Gibson, Master&#x27;s Mates John Green and Barry Sarsfield, 50 seamen and 20 marines. The boat crews rowed about 35 miles in eight hours, some of it in the blazing sun, before they were able to catch up with their quarry. The British tried to board twice, but her guns repelled them. The boats then pulled back and poured musket and small arms fire through the stern and quarter ports. This had the effect of clearing many of the enemy from her decks, including the captain and most of his officers. The British then were able to board on their third attempt. There they still faced a fight as the vessel&#x27;s crew outnumbered the attackers.

Still, Coombe and his men prevailed and discovered that they had captured the French navy corvette &quot;Lynx&quot;. She was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades, two 9-pounder chase guns and carried a crew of 161 men under the command of Mons. Jean M. Yarquest. Their resistance had cost the French 14 men killed and 20 wounded, including their captain. The British loss was 9 killed, including Lieutenant Walker. Coombe and Master&#x27;s Mates Sarsfield and Green were among the 22 wounded. Coombe&#x27;s wound was in the thigh above his previous amputation.

The surviving British officers received promotions. Coombe was promoted to commander but received an appointment as captain of , not &quot;Lynx&quot;. &quot;Hart&quot; was a lesser vessel than &quot;Lynx&quot; and Coombe complained to the admiral of the station and then to the Admiralty. The Admiralty reversed the appointments, which led to Coombe fighting a duel with the relegated captain. The Royal Navy took &quot;Lynx&quot; into service as &quot;Heureux&quot;.

The Patriotic Society awarded Coombe and several of the other British officers swords worth 50 guineas, but Coombe did not live to receive it. In 1849 the Navy awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;21 Jan. Boat Service 1807&quot; to all surviving claimants from the action.

Some two months after the capture of &quot;Lynx&quot;, on 3 March, &quot;Galatea&quot; captured an open boat. Then in October &quot;Galatea&quot; captured several Danish ships: 
*12 October: with the brig , under the command of Commander William Coombe, she captured the schooner &quot;John and Joseph&quot;;
*13 October: with the brig she captured the brig &quot;Catharini&quot;;
*17 October: again with &quot;Pert&quot;, she captured the brig &quot;Amalia&quot;;
*18 October: with she captured the Danish ship &quot;Johann Smidt Senior&quot;, Hans Jansen Hammer, master.

&quot;Galatea&quot; shared with &quot;Hart&quot;, &quot;Pert&quot;, &quot;Circe&quot;, &quot;Cygnet&quot; and others in the proceeds of the Danish schooner &quot;Danske Patriot&quot;, captured on 20 October.

In December &quot;Galatea&quot; was part of the squadron under Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane that captured the Danish islands of St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December. The Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless.

==Fate==
&quot;Galatea&quot; returned to England in the spring of 1809 where she was paid off. She was in poor condition and so was broken up at Woolwich in April. In November, Captain Sayer moved to command .

<text>New Faces is a British television talent show that aired in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been hosted by Leslie Crowther, Derek Hobson and Marti Caine. It was produced for the ITV network by ATV, and later by Central.

==Original series: 1973–1978==
The show first aired as a pilot on the ATV network on 31 May 1973 with host Leslie Crowther and a judging panel consisting of Noele Gordon, Tony Hatch, Clive James and John Smith assessing performances from ten acts looking for a break in show business. Welsh singer Jennifer Jones won the show that also featured a man who blew up a hot water bottle until it burst followed by a few choruses of &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;.

A further pilot aired on 7 July 1973 with new host Derek Hobson and a full series followed from 29 September 1973 to 2 April 1978. It was recorded at the ATV Centre in Birmingham. The show&#x27;s theme tune, &quot;You&#x27;re a Star!&quot;, was performed by singer Carl Wayne, formerly of The Move, and it was eventually released, becoming a minor hit.

Winners went on to have careers in television entertainment, such as Lenny Henry. Many top entertainers began their careers with a performance on this programme. The acts were evaluated by a panel of experts, including Tony Hatch, Mickie Most, Clifford Davis, Arthur Askey, Ted Ray, Ed Stewart, Jack Parnell, Alan A. Freeman, Muriel Young, Lonnie Donegan, Lionel Blair, Ingrid Pitt, Shaw Taylor, Terry Wogan and Noel Edmonds.

Four judges would make up the panel each week. Contestants received marks out of ten from the four judges in three categories such as &quot;presentation&quot;, &quot;content&quot; and &quot;star quality&quot; – The &quot;star quality&quot; category was later replaced by &quot;entertainment value&quot;. The highest score any act could attain was thus 120 points. Patti Boulaye was the only act who ever attained the maximum mark, doing so in the programme&#x27;s final season. Les Dennis received 119 points, with only Tony Hatch giving him less than a perfect &#x27;10&#x27; for Presentation. Arthur Askey was on the same panel and started singing &quot;Tony is a spoilsport&quot; when Hatch awarded Dennis 9 as his final score.

===Series 1–6 Winners===
===Series One Final (1973)===


===Series Two Final (1974)===


===Series Three Final (1975)===


===Series Five Final (1977)===


===Series Six Final (1978)===


==Revived version==
The series was revived by Central for three series between 1986 and 1988, presented by past winner Marti Caine. Her catchphrase was bellowed at the voting studio audience: &quot;Press your buttons... NOW!&quot;. The show also featured a panel of experts including the journalist Nina Myskow, who often made critical comments. In this incarnation, the home audience decided who won by sending in postcards (phone voting was soon introduced by BBC rival &quot;Bob Says Opportunity Knocks&quot;), though, the audience did vote for its favourite act using a gigantic lightboard known as Spaghetti Junction lighting up to a varying degree as they pushed their buttons.

===1986 final===


Note: The James Stone who appeared in this final is the same one who appeared in the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; semi-finals of 2008.

===1987 final===


===1988 final===
The 1988 final took place at the Birmingham Hippodrome Theatre on Saturday 3 December 1988 and was hosted by the 1975 winner Marti Caine.

<text>TickIT is a certification program for companies in the software development and computer industries, supported primarily by the United Kingdom and Swedish industries through UKAS and SWEDAC respectively. Its general objective is to improve software quality.

==History==
In the 1980s, the UK government&#x27;s CCTA organisation promoted the use of IT standards in the UK public sector, with work on BS5750 (Quality Management) leading to the publishing of the Quality Management Library and the inception of the TickIT assessment scheme with DTI, MoD and participation of software development companies.

TickIT also includes a guide. This provides guidance in understanding and applying ISO 9001 in the IT industry. It gives a background to the TickIT scheme, including its origins and objectives. Furthermore, it provides detailed information on how to implement a Quality System and the expected structure and content relevant to software activities. The TickIT guide also assists in defining appropriate measures and/or metrics. Various TickIT Guides have been issued, including &quot;Guide to Software Quality Management and Certification using EN29001&quot;.

<text>Michael Dana Gioia (; born December 24, 1950) is an American poet, literary critic, literary translator, and essayist.

Since the early 1980s, Gioia has been considered part of the highly controversial and countercultural literary movements within American poetry known as New Formalism, which advocates the continued writing of poetry in rhyme and meter, and New Narrative, which advocates the telling of non-autobiographical stories. Gioia has also argued in favor of a return to the past tradition of poetry translators replicating the rhythm and verse structure of the original poem.

Gioia helped renew the popularity of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and the rediscovery of Weldon Kees and John Allan Wyeth. He also co-founded the annual West Chester University Poetry Conference, which has run annually since 1995.

At the request of U.S. President George W. Bush, Gioia served between 2003 and 2009 as the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). In November 2006, &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine profiled Gioia as &quot;The Man Who Saved the NEA&quot;. Five years after Gioia left office, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to him as one of &quot;two of the NEA&#x27;s strongest leaders&quot;.

In December 2015, Gioia became the California State Poet Laureate.

Gioia has published six books of poetry and five volumes of literary criticism as well as opera libretti, song cycles, translations, and over two dozen literary anthologies. Gioia&#x27;s poetry has been anthologized in &quot;The Norton Anthology of Poetry&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Book of American Poetry&quot;, and several other anthologies. His poetry has been translated into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Chinese, and Arabic. Gioia published translations of poets such as Eugenio Montale and Seneca the Younger.

==Early Biography==
Gioia was born in Los Angeles in 1950, the child of a working-class Sicilian father and Mexican-American mother. He attended Catholic schools for twelve years. He became the first person in his family to attend college. He received a B.A. and M.B.A. from Stanford and an M.A. in Comparative Literature from Harvard. At Harvard he studied with poets Robert Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Bishop. For fifteen years he worked as a businessman in New York while writing at night and on weekends. In 1992 he quit to become a full-time writer.

==Writing and business career==
=== Criticism and beliefs about poetry ===
In a 2016 interview, Gioia recalled, &quot;As soon as I began publishing formal poems, my work was attacked.&quot; In response, he decided, &quot;to articulate my poetics&quot;, by publishing literary essays.

Gioia wrote the 1983 essay &quot;Business and Poetry&quot;, in which he pointed out how many other well-known figures in American poetry, including Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, and William Carlos Williams, had also made their livings outside of the academy.

In his influential 1987 essay &quot;Notes on the New Formalism&quot;, Gioia wrote: &quot;Literature not only changes; it must change to keep its force and vitality. There will always be groups advocating new types of poetry, some of it genuine, just as there will always be conservative opposing forces trying to maintain the conventional methods. But the revival of rhyme and meter among some young poets creates an unprecedented situation in American poetry. The New Formalists put the free-verse poets in the ironic and unprepared position of being the &quot;status quo&quot;. Free verse, the creation of an older literary revolution, is now the long-established, ruling orthodoxy, formal poetry the unexpected challenge... Form, we are told authoritatively, is artificial, elitist, retrogressive, right-wing, and (my favorite) Un-American. None of these arguments can withstand critical scrutiny, but nevertheless, they continue to be made so regularly that one can only assume that they provide some emotional comfort to their advocates. Obviously, for many writers the discussion between formal and free-verse has become an encoded political debate.&quot;

In a 2016 interview with John Cusatis, however, Dana Gioia explained, &quot;Literary movements are always temporary. They last a decade or so, and then they die or merge into the mainstream. The best New Formalist poets gradually became mainstream figures. There was no climax to the so-called Poetry Wars, only slow assimilation and change. Free and formal verse gradually ceased to be considered polar opposites. Form became one of the available styles of contemporary practice.&quot;

=== &quot;Can Poetry Matter?&quot; ===

In 1991, Gioia published the influential essay, &quot;Can Poetry Matter?&quot; in the April issue of &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. In the essay, Gioia began with the words, &quot;American poetry now belongs to a subculture. No longer part of the mainstream of artistic and intellectual life, it has become the specialized occupation of a relatively small and isolated group. Little of the frenetic activity it generates ever reaches outside that closed group. As a class, poets are not without cultural status. Like priests in a town of agnostics, they still command a certain residual prestige. But as individual artists, they are almost invisible.&quot;

The reason, Gioia explained, was that between 1940s and the 1960s, when college and university faculty positions were routinely offered to famous poets, American poetry had become imprisoned in college and university creative writing programs. As a result, recent poetry was no longer being read or studied by the vast majority of the American people. He alleged that, to say that a living poet was well-known, meant merely that he or she was well known to other poets, who were generally professors and graduate students. He further wrote that poetry was no longer a fruit of Literary Bohemia, but of academic bureaucracy.

Gioia concluded with the words, &quot;The history of art tells the same story over and over. As art forms develop, they establish forms that guide creation, performance, instruction, and analysis. But, eventually, these conventions grow stale. They begin to stand between the art and its audience. Although much wonderful poetry is being written, the American poetry establishment is locked into a series of outmoded conventions – outmoded ways of presenting, dissecting, and teaching poetry. Educational institutions have codified them into a stifling bureaucratic etiquette that enervates the art. These conventions may once have made sense, but today they imprison poetry in an intellectual ghetto. It is time to experiment, time to leave the well-ordered but stuffy classroom, time to restore a vulgar vitality to poetry and unleash the energy now trapped in the subculture. There is nothing to lose. Society has already told us that poetry is dead. Let&#x27;s build a funeral pyre out of the desiccated conventions piled around us and watch the unkillable Phoenix rise from the ashes.&quot;

Writing in 2002, Gioia recalled, &quot;When the original essay appeared in the April 1991 issue of &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the editors warned me to expect angry letters from interested parties. When the hate mail arrived typed on the letterheads of University writing programs, no one was surprised. What astonished the &quot;Atlantic&quot; editors, however, was the sheer size and intensity of the response. &quot;Can Poetry Matter?&quot; eventually generated more mail than any article the &quot;Atlantic&quot; had published in decades.&quot;

In 1992, Gioia resigned from his position as a vice president at General Foods to pursue a full-time career as a poet.

===Conferences===
Gioia has created several major literary conferences—each addressing a unique need. In 1995 he co-created (with fine-press printer Michael Peich) the West Chester Conference on Form and Narrative to provide training in poetic form. West Chester soon became the largest all-poetry conference in the U.S. It has run for thirty years. Gioia later created the “Teaching Poetry” (2001–2003) program for high school instructors. Although successful, it ended when Gioia became NEA Chairman. Finally, in 2013 he created the first “Catholic Literary Imagination Conference” at USC. This influential conference has been repeated at two-year intervals at Fordham, Loyola Chicago, and University of Dallas.

===NEA chairman===

In 2002, Gioia was nominated as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts by U.S. President George W. Bush. He was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Gioia served as chairman from 2003 to 2009, and worked to bring new visibility to the agency through a series of national initiatives that stressed broad democratic reach and artistic excellence.

With wide support from both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, Gioia gained a $20.1 million increase in his agency&#x27;s budget and for the remainder of his tenure, silenced the perpetual requests from conservative Republicans to abolish the NEA. In November 2006, &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine profiled Gioia as &quot;The Man Who Saved the NEA&quot;.

While Chairman, Gioia created several national initiatives each around a specific art. &quot;We have a generation of Americans growing up who have never been to the theater, the symphony, opera, dance, who have never heard fine jazz, and who increasingly don&#x27;t read,&quot; said Gioia, in justifying his efforts to bring large scale national initiatives of artistic excellence to millions of Americans. &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist William Safire referred to Gioia&#x27;s NEA national initiatives as &quot;A Gioia to Behold&quot;. His program &quot;Shakespeare in American Communities&quot; gave grants to more than 40 American theatre companies to tour small and medium-sized communities. His program The Big Read aimed to increase literacy across America. Based on the &quot;one city, one book&quot; concept, The Big Read brought together partner organizations across the country to encourage entire communities to read the same book. It was launched as a pilot program with ten communities in 2006, and went national in 2007, eventually becoming the largest literary program in the history of the federal government.

In 2006, Gioia created Poetry Out Loud, a national poetry recitation contest for students. Each year, some 375,000 students participate, beginning at the high school classroom level. Classroom winners advance to school-wide recitation competitions, and school champions advance to regional and state competitions, and ultimately to the National Finals in Washington, DC. The winner receives a $20,000 scholarship.

Gioia also re-energized the NEA Jazz Masters, which is the nation&#x27;s highest honor in jazz music, in order to raise the visibility of artists who he felt were undervalued in their own country.

Gioia&#x27;s term as NEA Chairman coincided with the peak of U.S. involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During that time, Gioia worked to include the U.S. military and their families in NEA national initiatives. He expanded his &quot;Shakespeare in American Communities&quot; program to include tours to military bases. The NEA also sent young artist programs from opera companies around the country to military bases with the Great American Voices Military Base Tour. In 2004, Gioia launched &quot;Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience&quot;, which collected writings from U.S. troops and their families about their wartime experiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, and stateside. Many of the writings were collected in the anthology &quot;Operation Homecoming&quot;. The anthology was named one of the &quot;Best of 2006&quot; non-fiction by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. A documentary based on Operation Homecoming, produced by the Documentary Group, was nominated for a 2006 Academy Award.

Gioia stepped down from the NEA in January 2009 to return to poetry.

Five years after Gioia left office, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred to him as one of &quot;two of the NEA&#x27;s strongest leaders&quot;.

=== Teaching ===
Gioia has never taught full-time. He has been a visiting professor for a single term at Johns Hopkins, Sarah Lawrence, Wesleyan, Mercer University, and Colorado College. For nine years he taught literature and music at the University of Southern California as the Judge Widney Professor of Poetry and Public Culture. He quit in 2019.

=== California Poet Laureate ===

In 2015 Gioia was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown as the Poet Laureate of California. During his four years in office, Gioia became the first state laureate to visit all 58 counties in California. Focusing on small and mid-sized communities, he participated in over 100 events with local writers and students. His travels became the subject of a BBC Radio 3 documentary.

==Personal life==
On February 23, 1980, he and Mary Elizabeth Hiecke were married. They had three sons, one of whom died in infancy. His poem &quot;Planting a Sequoia&quot; is based on his experience of losing his infant son.

==Poetry==
Gioia has published six full-length volumes of poetry in addition to many smaller fine-press books and pamphlets. Although Gioia is best known for helping revive rhyme and meter, all of his books contain a mix of poems in free and formal verse. His first collection, &quot;Daily Horoscope&quot; (1986), attracted much notice, favorable and unfavorably, because of its use of rhyme, meter and verse narrative, but its most widely reprinted poem, “California Hills in August,” is in free verse.

&quot;The Gods of Winter&quot; (1991), Gioia’s dark second collection, contains poems written after the death of his first son. Published in the U.S. and U.K, the British edition was chosen by the Poetry Book Society as their main selection. This volume demonstrated Gioia’s interest in narrative poetry with two long dramatic monologues, “Counting the Children” in which an accountant has a disturbing interaction with a dead woman’s grotesque doll collection, and “The Homecoming,” which is spoken by an escaped returning home to commit one final murder.

Gioia’s third collection, &quot;Interrogations at Noon&quot; (2001), was the winner of the 2002 American Book Award. This diverse book, which contains both original poems and translations, was followed by a decade of silence during Gioia’s service at the National Endowment for the Arts and the Aspen Institute. &quot;Pity the Beautiful&quot; (2012) marked Gioia’s return to poetry and included two chilling poems, “Special Treatments Ward,” which describes a terminal ward in a children’s hospital, and “Haunted,” a dramatic monologue in equal parts of a love story and a ghost story. “Haunted” was turned into a ballet-opera by composer Paul Salerni.

Gioia’s next volume, &quot;99 Poems: New &amp; Selected&quot; (2016), surveyed his career in an unusual way. Rather than present his poems chronologically, Gioia arranged them by seven themes. The book won the Poets’ Prize. Gioia’s most recent volume, &quot;Meet Me at the Lighthouse&quot; (2023), paid special attention to his Mexican roots and included “The Ballad of Jesus Ortiz,” which recounts the life and death of this great-grandfather, a vaquero who was killed in a racially motivated incident.

Gioia&#x27;s most recent collection of poems is &quot;Meet Me at the Lighthouse&quot;, published in 2023.

===Music and opera===
Gioia has collaborated with musicians including James MacMillan, Ned Rorem, Lori Laitman, Morten Lauridsen, Paul Salerni, Alva Henderson, David Conte, Tom Cipullo, Stefania de Kenessey, and John Harbison. His jazz collaborators include Dave Brubeck, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, and Helen Sung.

Gioia has written three opera libretti. His first opera, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, with music by Alva Henderson, was jointly premiered by Rimrock Opera and Opera Idaho in 2004. His second libretto, &quot;Tony Caruso&#x27;s Final Broadcast&quot;, with music by Paul Salerni, won the National Opera Association award for best new chamber opera and was premiered in Los Angeles in 2008. Both of these works have been recorded. His latest opera, &quot;The Three Feathers&quot;, with music by Lori Laitman, was premiered by Virginia Tech and Opera Roanoke in 2014.

<text>The Taizé Community () is an ecumenical Christian monastic community in Taizé, Saône-et-Loire, Burgundy, France. It is composed of about one hundred brothers, from Catholic and Protestant traditions, who originate from about thirty countries around the world. It was founded in 1940 by Brother Roger Schütz, a Reformed Protestant. Guidelines for the community&#x27;s life are contained in &quot;The Rule of Taizé&quot; written by Brother Roger and first published in French in 1954.

Taizé has become one of the world&#x27;s most important sites of Christian pilgrimage, with a focus on youth. Over 100,000 young people from around the world make pilgrimages to Taizé each year for prayer, Bible study, sharing, and communal work. Through the community&#x27;s ecumenical outlook, they are encouraged to live in the spirit of kindness, simplicity and reconciliation. The community&#x27;s church, the Church of Reconciliation, was inaugurated on 6 August 1962. It was designed by a Taizé member and architect, Brother Denis. Young Germans from Action Reconciliation Service for Peace, created for reconciliation after World War II, assumed the work of building it. Owing to the founder&#x27;s commitment, since its inception the community has evolved into an important site for Catholic–Lutheran ecumenism. A Catholic, Brother Alois, succeeded as prior after his predecessor&#x27;s death in 2005. In 2023 Brother Alois announced his resignation and was succeeded by Brother Matthew on the 2nd December 2023.

==History==
===Early years===

The Taizé Community was founded by Brother Roger (Roger Schütz) in 1940. He pondered what it really meant to live a life according to the Scriptures and began a quest for a different expression of the Christian life. A year after this decision, Schütz reflected:

Because his native Switzerland was neutral and thus less affected by the war, Schütz felt as if France would be ideal for his vision, seeing it as a &quot;land of poverty, a land of wartime suffering, but a land of inner freedom.&quot; He eventually settled in Taizé, which was a small, isolated village just north of Cluny, the site of a historically influential Christian monastic foundation.

In September 1940, Schütz purchased a small farm house that would eventually become the home of the Taizé Community. Only miles south of the demarcation line that separated Vichy France and the &quot;Zone occupée&quot;, Brother Roger&#x27;s home became a sanctuary to countless war refugees seeking shelter. On November 11, 1942, the Gestapo occupied Roger&#x27;s house while he was in Switzerland collecting funds to aid in his refuge ministry. Roger was not able to return to his home in Taizé until the autumn of 1944, when France was liberated.

In 1941, Brother Roger had published a few small brochures outlining several facets of a Christ-centred communal life together. These brochures prompted two young men to apply, soon followed by a third. They all lived in Switzerland in a flat owned by Roger&#x27;s family until after the war when they began a new life together in the French countryside. Over the next few years several other men would join the community. On Easter Sunday 1949, seven brothers committed themselves to a life following Christ in simplicity, celibacy and community.

===Growth and current situation===
In the years that followed, others joined. In 1969, a young Belgian doctor became the first Catholic to pledge his life to the Taizé Community. More brothers from Reformed, Anglican and Catholic backgrounds joined the community. Soon the Brothers of Taizé were making trips to take aid to people in both rural and urban areas. They began forming &quot;fraternities&quot; of brothers in other cities that sought to be &quot;signs of the presence of Christ among men, and bearers of joy&quot;. Since 1951, the brothers have lived, for longer or shorter periods, in small fraternities among the poor in India (chiefly in Calcutta), Bangladesh, the Philippines, Algeria, Cuba, South Korea, Brazil, Kenya, Senegal, and the United States (chiefly in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of Manhattan, New York City).

In August 2005 Brother Roger, aged 90, was killed in a knife attack by a mentally-ill woman. At his funeral, Brother Roger had an ecumenical dream fulfilled. The presider at his funeral was the president of the Vatican&#x27;s council for the unity of Christians, Cardinal Walter Kasper. Anglican bishop Nigel McCulloch of Manchester, England, who represented Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, read the first reading in English. The second reading was read in French by the Rev. Jean-Arnold de Clermont, president of the Conference of European Churches, and in German by Bishop Wolfgang Huber, head of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Cardinals and archbishops, Orthodox, Anglican and other religious leaders and international politicians joined ordinary Christians in prayer during the funeral, including the President of Germany, Horst Köhler, and the retired Archbishop of Paris, Jean-Marie Lustiger. His funeral was attended by approximately 10,000 people.

In 2010, for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Taizé, five years after Brother Roger&#x27;s death, ecumenical messages of love and benediction were received from church leaders as varied as: 
* Pope Benedict XVI 
* Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople 
* Patriarch Kirill of Moscow 
* The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams 
* The General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation, Ishmael Noko
* The General Secretary of the World Communion of Reformed Churches, Setri Nyomi
* The General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, Olav Fykse Tveit
* The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu
* The Anglican Archbishop of the Cape, Thabo Cecil Makgoba
* The President of the German Bishops&#x27; Conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch
* The President of the Netherlands Episcopal Conference, Ad van Luyn
* The President of the Community of Christian Churches in the Canton of Vaud, Pastor Martin Hoegger.

At the end of 2010, the community was composed of about one hundred brothers, from Protestant and Catholic traditions, who originate from about thirty countries around the world. From 2005 to 2023, the community was led by Brother Alois, a German-born Catholic, who had been appointed by Brother Roger before his death.
After consulting his brothers, Brother Alois appointed Brother Matthew, a British Anglican, to succeed him in December 2023.

==Components==

=== Music and worship===

The community, though Western European in origin, has sought to include people and traditions worldwide. They have sought to demonstrate this in the music and prayers where songs are sung in many languages, and have included chants and icons from the Eastern Orthodox tradition. The music emphasizes simple phrases, usually lines from Psalms or other pieces of Scripture, repeated and sometimes also sung in canon.
Earlier Taizé community music was conceived and composed by Jacques Berthier. Later Joseph Gelineau became a major contributor to the music.

Ecumenical services based on this model and music are held in many churches throughout the world.

==Young adult meetings==
===In Taizé===

Throughout the year, meetings for young adults between 15 and 35 years old (and, within certain limits, for adults and families with children) take place in Taizé. The number of visitors reaches more than 5,000 during the summer and on Easter. Meetings usually last from Sunday to Sunday, though it is also possible to just come for a few days, or, for young volunteers, to stay for a longer time.

Several sisters also help with running the meetings. However, they are not &quot;Taizé Sisters&quot;. These sisters come from various orders, most notably the Catholic order of St. Andrew from Belgium. The Sisters of St. Andrew live in the neighboring village Ameugny.
The schedule of a typical day in the youth meetings:
* Morning prayer
* Breakfast
* Bible introduction with a brother of the community followed by quiet reflection or small group discussion
* Midday prayer
* Lunch
* Song practice (optional)
* Practical tasks
* Tea time
* Workshops (optional)
* Supper
* Evening prayer
* Informal gathering at Oyak, a common area at Taizé (optional)

The evening prayer is broadcast every Saturday at 22:00 Central European Time by the German radio station Domradio and provided online as a podcast.

===Worldwide===

The Taizé Community attempts to send pilgrims back from youth meetings to their local churches, to their parishes, groups or communities, to undertake, with many others, a &quot;Pilgrimage of Trust on Earth.&quot; Every year around New Year (usually from 28 December to 1 January), a meeting in a large European city attracts several tens of thousands of young adults. It is organized by brothers of the Taizé Community, sisters of St. Andrew, and young volunteers from all over Europe, and from the host city. The participants stay with local families or in very simple group accommodations. In the morning, they take part in a program organized by the parish closest to their accommodation. For their midday meal, all participants travel to a central location, usually the local exhibition halls. The meal is followed by a common prayer, and the afternoon is spent in workshops covering faith, art, politics and social topics. In the evening, everyone meets again for the evening meal and an evening prayer.

In his &quot;Unfinished Letter&quot;, published after his death, Brother Roger is quoted to have proposed to &quot;widen&quot; the &quot;Pilgrimage of Trust&quot; originating from the Taizé community. As a result, international meetings for young adults have begun to take place, beginning with Kolkata in India in 2006. The program closely resembles the European meetings, though some aspects, such as the songs, are often adapted to the local culture.

<text>Oldies is a term for musical genres such as pop music, rock and roll, doo-wop, surf music, broadly characterized as classic rock and pop rock, from the second half of the 20th century, specifically from around the mid-1950s to the 1980s, as well as for a radio format playing this music.

Since 2000, 1970s music has been increasingly included in this genre. &quot;Classic hits&quot; have been seen as a successor to the oldies format on the radio, with music from the 1980s serving as the core example.

==Description==
This category includes styles as diverse as doo-wop, early rock and roll, novelty songs, bubblegum music, folk rock, psychedelic rock, baroque pop, surf music, soul music, rhythm and blues, classic rock, some blues, and some country music.

Golden Oldies usually refers to music exclusively from the 1950s and 1960s. Oldies radio typically features artists such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, The Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Beach Boys, Frankie Avalon, The Four Seasons, Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, Little Richard and Sam Cooke; as well as such musical movements and genres as early rock and roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, soul music, Motown, British Invasion, early girl groups, surf music, teen idol singers, teenage tragedy songs, and bubblegum pop. Music from the folk revival and instrumental beautiful music are among the most commonly excluded recordings from the Oldies era.

Most traditional Oldies stations limit their on-air playlists to no more than 300 songs, based on the programming strategy that average listeners and passive listeners will stay tuned provided they are familiar with the hits being played. A drawback to this concept is the constant heavy rotation and repetition of the station&#x27;s program library, as well as rejection of the format by active listeners. This can be avoided either through the use of a broader playlist or by rotating different songs from the Oldies era into and out of the playlist every few weeks.

Oldies has some overlap with the classic hits and classic rock formats. Classic hits features pop and rock hits from the early 1970s to early 1990s, while classic rock focuses on album rock from the late 1960s to 1990s (sometimes playing newer material made in the same style as the older songs). As formats have drifted in time with their target audiences, classic hits and classic rock have moved further away from pure Oldies, which has largely remained a static format.

In the early days of the rock era, the term Oldies referred to the traditional pop songs of previous decades; a 1953 record review in &quot;Billboard&quot; describes 1925&#x27;s &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; as an Oldie. Oldies is known for the near-total and sometimes arbitrary exclusion of some acts that were very popular in their time, including The Osmonds and Barbra Streisand.

==Classic hits format==

A variation on the Oldies theme is classic hits, which provides most of the playlist of Oldies with some classic rock with an addition of contemporaneous R&amp;B and pop hits as well, creating a balance between the mostly 1970s-focused classic rock genre and the more broad-based Oldies format. The evolution of Oldies into classic hits is an example of channel drift.

==Radio history==
===20th century===

The Oldies format began to appear in the early 1970s. KOOL-FM in Phoenix became one of the first radio stations to play Oldies music, at that time focusing on the 1950s and early 1960s.

In the 1960s, very few top 40 radio stations played anything more than a few years old. In the late 1960s, a few FM stations adopted top 40 formats that leaned towards adults who did not want to hear the same 30 songs repetitively but also did not want to hear music featured on Middle of the road radio stations. They mixed in Oldies with their current product and only played new music a few times an hour. These radio stations were often referred to as &quot;gold&quot; stations. Some AM radio stations also began to employ this format. There were also syndicated music format packages such as Drake-Chenault&#x27;s &quot;Solid Gold&quot; format, frequently used on FM stations that needed separate programming from their AM sisters (due to then-new FCC rules on simulcasting), that functioned as a hybrid of Oldies and the adult-oriented softer rock hits of the day. The popularity of the movie &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is often credited with helping to spur the 1950s nostalgia movement of the early 1970s. It is this movement that gave rise to a number of gold-based stations, such as WHND/WHNE (Honey Radio) in Detroit, WCBS-FM in New York City, WQSR in Baltimore, and WROR in Boston, that were classified as Oldies stations and not adult top 40. These stations, did play current product sparingly (one or two per hour) throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s; WCBS-FM, for example, played current hits under the moniker &quot;Future Gold&quot; through the late 1980s, and WLNG on nearby Long Island featured a roughly 50/50 mix of current hits and Oldies from the early 1960s until about 1999. 

Most of these &quot;Solid Gold&quot; stations began to either evolve into other formats or drop the format altogether in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Most AM gold stations flipped to other formats. Some FM stations evolved into adult contemporary stations, including WROR in Boston and WFYR in Chicago. In the early 1980s many AC stations began mixing in more Oldies into regular rotation and aired Oldies shows on Saturday nights.

Beginning in 1982, both AM and FM stations began changing to full-time Oldies formats. These stations played strictly music from 1955 to 1973, focusing on the 1964–1969 era. Among these Oldies stations were WNBC in New York City before 1988, WDRC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut, WODS in Boston, WOGL in Philadelphia, KLUV in Dallas, WWSW in Pittsburgh, WJMK in Chicago, and CHUM in Toronto. Some had as few as 300 songs while stations like WODS and WOGL had as many as 1,500 songs in regular rotation. By 1989, most large and medium markets had at least one, usually FM, Oldies station.

This period also saw the rise of syndicated radio shows specifically aimed at an Oldies format. They included &quot;Soundtrack of the 1960s with Murray the K&quot;, &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Rock, Roll &amp; Remember&quot;, &quot;Live from the &#x27;60s with The Real Don Steele&quot;, &quot;Cruisin&#x27; America with Cousin Brucie&quot;, and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&#x27;s Greatest Hits with Dick Bartley&quot;. Most of these shows were three hours long and featured much of the same music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that was in rotation at affiliate stations. All but a few of these shows had ended their run by the mid-1990s, though Bartley&#x27;s ran into the late 2000s (and eventually returned for several years in the late 2010s) while Clark&#x27;s show continued until his 2004 stroke and in reruns until 2020.

From 1986 to 1990 several solid gold stations evolved into full-time Oldies stations by eliminating current and recent product while also gradually eliminating 1980s songs and limiting 1970s songs substantially. KRTH and WQSR both did this in the late 1980s into the early 1990s. WCBS-FM however continued playing current product in regular rotation until 1988. After that, they played it once an hour between 11pm and 5:30am, until 2001. WCBS-FM also played several 1990s songs per shift during these overnight hours. They also continued to play between one 1980s song every couple of hours to as many as two per hour day and night. WCBS-FM also played from three to five songs per hour from the 1970s. They indeed played more 1970s music than any other notable Oldies station. At the same time, WCBS-FM featured slightly more pre 1964 songs than the average station playing as many as five of those per hour.

Oldies stations continued to be late 1960s based throughout the 1990s. WCBS-FM was an exception. Most AM Oldies stations also disappeared by the early 1990s except in markets where there was no FM oldies outlet. The format fared well with no end in sight.

===21st century===
Beginning in 2000, Oldies stations began to notice that their demographics were getting older and harder to sell. Still, at that time only a few stations dumped the format altogether. A few, such as Orlando&#x27;s WOCL and Sacramento&#x27;s KHYL shifted to the briefly popular and more disco-centric rhythmic oldies format; most others continued to hang onto the format initially.

Since around 2000, stations have begun to limit selections from the 1950s and early 1960s. At the same time these stations began playing songs from as late as 1979 and even a few 1980s songs. WCBS-FM New York slightly cut back on the pre-1964 oldies and slightly increased the 1970s and 1980s songs early in 2001. They also eliminated the overnight currents at the same time along with some speciality shows.

In 2002, many Oldies stations began dropping pre-1964 music from their playlists, since the earlier music tended to appeal to an older demographic that advertisers found undesirable—hence, the addition of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. WCBS-FM canceled their &quot;Doo Wop Shop&quot; program and began playing only one pre-1964 oldie per hour; by 2003, there were fewer than 50 songs from the 1950s and early 1960s in the regular rotation. 

Many stations have since dropped the Oldies format because of low ad revenue despite high ratings. On June 3, 2005, New York City&#x27;s WCBS-FM, an Oldies-based station for over three decades, abruptly switched to the Jack FM format, resulting in a tremendous outcry from Oldies fans in the Big Apple and a huge decline in revenue followed. WJMK in Chicago (WCBS-FM&#x27;s sister station) switched to Jack FM on the same day. Some point to the demise of WCBS-FM and WJMK as a sign that the Oldies format is in danger, for many of the same reasons that the adult standards and smooth jazz formats are disappearing. 

The Oldies format returned to WCBS-FM on July 12, 2007, in an updated form featuring music from 1964 to 1989 without the word &quot;Oldies&quot;, but rather &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in the on-air positioning, with songs such as &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; by Cyndi Lauper, &quot;Gloria&quot; by Laura Branigan, and corporate rock hit &quot;We Built This City&quot; by Starship in rotation (though the original WCBS-FM played current hits mixed in with its Oldies as late as the late 1980s and the three songs mentioned here during most of their years). 

By the mid-2010s, as the phrase &quot;classic hits&quot; came to entail a format centered around late 1970s (disco-era) and 1980s pop, dance and rock format, the phrase &quot;Oldies&quot; had come to entail a 1960s to mid-1970s format that centered mostly on soft rock and easy listening (akin to the old MOR format), examples including WRME-LD in Chicago. More upbeat 1960s and 1970s stations are known within the industry as &quot;gold&quot; classic hits.

As of 2020, 1960s music is becoming increasingly rare on radio. Of the 1000 most played songs on radio as of May 2020, only four of them are from before 1970, and three of them also benefit from being aired on classic rock stations, Oldies, and classic hits. Of the 100 songs that suffered the most drop-off in popularity from their heyday to 2022, a majority were from the 1960s; 56% were from before the British Invasion and another 13% were from then to 1969. This is despite a small pantheon of songs from that era that have become part of an &quot;eternal jukebox of all-ages event records,&quot; as well as parents and grandparents who had listened to the music when they were younger passing those songs on to their children; in the latter case, the older songs popular among the younger crowd can be more random, driven by exposure in television, film, commercials and person-to-person.

==Oldies stations==
The Oldies format remains one of the most popular formats on radio in markets where it is still active. Some of the most successful major-market Oldies stations today include KRTH &quot;K-Earth 101&quot; in Los Angeles, XHPRS-FM &quot;105.7 the Walrus&quot; in Tijuana-San Diego, KOLA 99.9 in Riverside-San Bernandino KYNO in Fresno, California, 98.1 WOGL in Philadelphia, WMJI &quot;Majic 105.7&quot; in Cleveland, and KSPF in Dallas. WLS-FM in Chicago, however, is similar to the way Oldies stations sounded several years back, still playing one or two pre-1964 songs an hour during the day and as many as four an hour at night. However, to illustrate the continued decline in the format, San Francisco&#x27;s KFRC moved toward Classic Hits in 2005 and dropped this format entirely in 2006 in favor of the Rhythmic AC &quot;MOViN&quot; format, which left most of Northern California without an oldies station until the debut of KCCL (K-Hits 92.1) in Sacramento in January 2007. However, KFRC had already evolved its format and positioning to classic hits at the time it changed to &quot;Movin&quot;. But KFRC was not gone for long. On May 17, 2007, with Free FM hot talk format failing on 106.9 KIFR CBS relaunched KFRC with a rock leaning classic hits format on 106.9. But KFRC was not back for long either. On October 27, 2008, 106.9 KFRC FM became an all news 740 KCBS AM simulcast. KFRC now only airs on 106.9 FM HD-2 and online at KFRC.com. But KFRC came back again. On January 1, 2009, KFRC returned on the radio at 1550 AM, as true Oldies.

KZQZ, which aired in St. Louis, and began playing Oldies in March 2008, held onto the traditional Oldies format, playing a wide variety of top 40 Billboard hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, until the FCC forced the station off the air in 2020. Non-commercial WXRB, 95.1 FM in Dudley, Massachusetts (one of the first non-commercial all-Oldies stations in North America) began playing Golden Oldies on March 6, 2005, at 1:00pm, focusing on the years 1954 through 1979.

On August 27, 2009, Grand Rapids, Michigan station WGVU became the first public radio station to feature an all-Oldies format. The format has since been imitated by other public radio stations; for example, WCNY-FM in Syracuse, New York has begun broadcasting a personality-based oldies format on its HD Radio digital subchannel.

Jones Radio Networks, Waitt Radio Networks and Transtar Radio Networks also offered 24-hour satellite-distributed Oldies formats; since those companies have integrated into the Dial Global corporation, the networks have merged into one, Kool Gold. Satellite Music Network offered &quot;Oldies Radio&quot;, which survived until its acquisition by ABC but has since rebranded as Classic Hits Radio under current owner Cumulus Media Networks, focusing on music primarily from the 1970s and 1980s, with some limited 1960s music.

ABC also offered The True Oldies Channel, a 24-hour Oldies network programmed and voice tracked at all hours by Scott Shannon, at the time morning show host at ABC&#x27;s WPLJ. The True Oldies Channel was conceived on the concept of avoiding the drift into 1970s and 1980s music that the Oldies format was undergoing in the first years of the 21st century. Eventually, by the end of the network&#x27;s terrestrial run in 2014, it had taken a hybrid approach, with both 1960s and 1970s music being featured at the core of the network, with some limited 1980s music included.

In North America, satellite radio broadcasters XM and Sirius launched in 2001 and 2002, respectively, with more than a dozen Oldies radio channels, with XM offering separate stations for each decade from the 1940s to the 1990s, and Sirius doing the same for the 1950s through the 1980s, initially all in prime single-digit channel positions. These companies also offered specific genre channels for disco and dance hits, garage rock, classic rock, classic country, and vintage R&amp;B and soul hits. These pay radio channels boasted thousands of songs in their libraries, ensuring far less repetition than traditional broadcast stations. In November 2008, following a merger of Sirius and XM, the two services shifted to a unified group of decades channels, with the playlists for most cut back to reflect a more conventional style of Oldies programming. SiriusXM further marginalized its Oldies stations over the years, moving its 1940s channel off channel 4 in 2015, then in 2021 by moving its 1950s and 1960s channels out of their 5 and 6 channel slots respectively. Music Choice similarly offers an interruption-free Oldies station, which includes music from the 1950s, 1960s, and decades channels for the 1970s through the 1990s. A number of Internet radio stations also carry the format.

From the late 2010s until 2022, shortwave radio station WTWW operated an Oldies service in the evening hours. In November 2022, WTWW lead engineer Ted Randall left the station and took the Oldies programming to a dedicated transmitter on WRMI a short distance down the dial from WTWW on the 60-meter band.

<text>Borgerhout () is the smallest district of Antwerp, Belgium. , the district housed 45,769 inhabitants on 3.93 km².
It was an independent municipality until January 1983. The postal area code for Borgerhout is 2140.

==Geography==
Borgerhout is divided into two parts by a highway and the historical walls.
The part inside those walls is &quot;intra muros,&quot; meaning (within the walls). It is built around a big boulevard, the Turnhoutsebaan

== Demographics ==
Borgerhout has an extremely diverse population, with 63% percent of inhabitants having non-Belgian ancestry. Of the nine districts of Antwerp, it has the highest population density.

== History ==

Borgerhout was first mentioned in the year 1214 in an act written by the Duke of Brabant. It was then named &#x27;Borgerholt&#x27;.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Borger&quot; likely comes from the old word for citizen or city dweller. Currently, the Dutch word for this is &quot;burger&quot;. It might also refer to the word &quot;borgh&quot;, meaning a fortress or fortified building. Borghmeester (1254) or borgermeyster (1286) are mentioned in written sources as the word for &quot;mayor&quot;, literally &quot;master of the fortress&quot; or &quot;master of the citizens&quot;. &quot;Hout&quot; (or previously &quot;holt) means &quot;wood&quot;. It is similar to some naming conventions in English, for example &quot;Hollywood&quot;. It refers to a time when Borgerhout was still much greener, and had not yet merged with greater Antwerp. It likely also explains the tree on the coat of arms.

<doc id="973957" wikidata="Q741313" url="?curid=973957" title="Milan Mandarić">
<text>Milan Mandarić (; born 5 September 1938) is a Serbian-American businessman who has owned a string of businesses and association football clubs, including Portsmouth, Leicester City and Sheffield Wednesday. He was born near Gospić, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (today Croatia), and grew up in Novi Sad, Serbia. He is currently the vice-president of Serbian Superliga team Vojvodina.

==Business activities==
===Yugoslavia and Serbia===
Mandarić took control of his father&#x27;s machine shop aged 21, and by the age of 26 had turned it into one of the largest businesses in the country. His homeland of Yugoslavia was a socialist country where successful business owners and affluent people in general were considered to represent a political threat to the ruling communist party regime, which is why he and his family left the country.

===United States===
In 1969, worried by the Yugoslav government&#x27;s view of his business, Mandarić left Yugoslavia and settled in the United States. He had to leave most of his fortune behind, and got a job for an American computer component manufacturer in California. When two of the senior managers left to start their own firm, Mandarić was invited to be their third partner. The firm was successful, but disagreements over manufacturing processes led to Mandarić leaving to form his own company, Lika Corporation, in 1971. In 1976, he became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. By 1976, Lika Corp. was the largest manufacturer of computer components in the U.S., and Mandarić was pioneering the boom that led to the creation of California&#x27;s Silicon Valley. He sold the company to the Tandy Corporation in 1980 and set up a new company, Sanmina, which manufactured printed circuit boards. In 2001, the company acquired SCI Systems, a much larger competitor, becoming Sanmina-SCI Corporation. Mandarić also began branching out into investment banking operations, such as Behrman Capital. He also became owner of the St. Louis Storm, a Major Indoor Soccer League franchise which ceased operations in 1992 when the MISL also folded. He was ranked 1,049 in the times top 2,000 rich list, worth £75 million.

On 23 December 2009, Mandarić was charged with two counts of tax evasion by the Crown Prosecution Service, however he was found not guilty on 8 February 2012.

==Football==
===United States===
Around the same time he had begun using his money to invest in football, Mandarić&#x27;s passion since childhood (as a young man he had played for Novi Sad). He set up firstly F.C. Lika, then San Jose Earthquakes which played in the United States&#x27; first professional league. In 1978, he purchased a North American Soccer League franchise called the Connecticut Bicentennials and moved them to Oakland, California, to play as the Stompers. After one year in the East Bay, the team was moved to Edmonton, Alberta, to become the Drillers.

===Europe===
Sceptical about the future of the sport in the U.S., Mandarić looked to European football, initially taking a stake in Belgian team Standard Liège before taking outright ownership of Belgian club R. Charleroi S.C., then French side OGC Nice. Under his ownership the latter club won the 1996–97 Coupe de France but they were also relegated from the French top division.

===Portsmouth===
In 1998, Mandarić sold Nice and took over English club Portsmouth in May 1999, to whom he had been introduced by ex-player Preki.

After struggling for a number of years in the second tier of English football (now the EFL Championship), Portsmouth won promotion as champions to the Premier League, arguably the richest football division in the world. This was due in large part to Mandarić&#x27;s appointment of the experienced manager Harry Redknapp. Mandarić appointed Velimir Zajec as executive director, a move which caused tension between Redknapp and Mandarić. Shortly afterwards, Redknapp resigned from Portsmouth.

In January 2006, Mandarić sold a 50% stake in the club to French-Israeli businessman Alexandre Gaydamak. After the club&#x27;s survival that season, Mandarić sold his remaining share of Portsmouth to Gaydamak, but stayed on as a figurehead in his role as non-executive chairman.

Mandarić resigned as chairman of Portsmouth on 21 September 2006. Since then, Portsmouth appeared to prosper, with successive top-ten Premier League finishes and an FA Cup win in 2008. The club, however, was relegated in 2010.

Portsmouth City Council conferred the Freedom of the City of Portsmouth on Mandarić in 2003.

=== Leicester City ===
On 24 February, Mandarić made a bid for East Midlands club Leicester City, believed to be in the region of £25 million. He had wanted to remain outside of football for a longer period, however he &quot;had to accelerate takeover plans&quot; because of bids for the club by at least two other parties. On 18 November 2006, Leicester City accepted his approach to take over the club at an extraordinary general meeting.

Despite setting an initial takeover deadline of 15 December, negotiations stalled, reportedly after hidden debts in the club&#x27;s accounts surfaced during the due diligence period. Both parties, however, dismissed reports that the takeover bid was in danger of collapse, stating that it had merely been delayed. Indeed, on 2 January the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; reported that the deal was in fact close to completion after Mandarić&#x27;s revised terms were accepted by the club&#x27;s board.
On 15 January, the paper reported that an official announcement confirming the takeover &quot;will probably be on Thursday&quot;.

On 25 January, Mandarić put his bid for Leicester on temporary hold after news of his mother&#x27;s illness back in Serbia. There were wild rumours that suggested he was on the verge of pulling out and, indeed, the delay guaranteed that manager Rob Kelly would not enjoy the benefit of a cash injection before the season&#x27;s transfer window closed on 31 January. Mandarić, however, returned from Serbia to complete the deal the following week.

On 13 February 2007, Mandarić was officially unveiled as owner of Leicester City. However, that the club were still a public limited company (PLC) meant he did not acquire the title of chairman for a further 23 days. In April 2007, he sacked manager Kelly and replaced him with Nigel Worthington as caretaker manager for the last five games of the season. At the end of the season, Martin Allen was named the club&#x27;s new permanent manager but Allen left after only three months in charge in August as a result of deteriorating relations with Mandarić. Gary Megson was then appointed in September, becoming the third manager since Mandarić took over the club. Megson left after only six weeks in charge to take control of Premier League team Bolton Wanderers. Ian Holloway was Mandarić&#x27;s fourth permanent manager, appointed in November 2007. Leicester, however, was relegated to League One at the end of the season for the first time in the club&#x27;s history; many observers attributed this to the large turnover in managers since Mandarić took control of the club.

Mandarić was arrested on 28 November 2007 over allegations of corruption in football, along with Harry Redknapp, Peter Storrie, Willie McKay and Amdy Faye. but was later released without charge.

After tumultuous times, however, things started to look up for Mandarić as Leicester were crowned champions of League One on 18 April 2009 under the stewardship of Nigel Pearson. The Foxes came close to achieving a second successive promotion the following season (something not achieved by any club at this level for a decade) as they finished fifth in the Championship but lost to Cardiff City in the playoff semi-finals.

During the close season, it was reported that Mandarić had agreed to sell Leicester City to a consortium of Thai businessmen, but these reports were swiftly denied by club officials. Just weeks later, however, he sold the club for a reported £40 million to Vichai Raksriaksorn and his son Aiyawatt. It later emerged that Mandarić was a shareholder in the consortium and he was re-appointed chairman.

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
On 29 November 2010, Mandarić agreed to purchase Sheffield Wednesday. The purchase was completed after an extraordinary general meeting of Sheffield Wednesday shareholders on 14 December 2010, during which 99.7% of shareholders voted to sell the company to Mandarić&#x27;s UK Football Investments for £1. Mandarić had agreed to settle the club&#x27;s outstanding debts as part of the largely confidential deal. He negotiated settlements with a number of the club&#x27;s creditors, including an agreement to pay the Co-operative Bank £7m of the £23m owed to them, and a deal to pay £1.5m of the £2.4m owed to five of the club&#x27;s directors. Mandarić also stepped down as chairman of Leicester City, due to Football League rules preventing him from being the chairman of two different clubs. During his time as owner Wednesday secured promotion from League One to the Championship in 2012. In 2014 Mandarić agreed to sell the club to Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov, however this fell through, and in January 2015 Mandarić struck a deal to sell the club to Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri for £37.5m, a sum which included money to clear the club&#x27;s debts.

<doc id="973959" wikidata="Q275926" url="?curid=973959" title="Bumetanide">
<text>Bumetanide, sold under the brand name Bumex among others, is a medication used to treat swelling and high blood pressure. This includes swelling as a result of heart failure, liver failure, or kidney problems. It may work for swelling when other medications have not. For high blood pressure it is not a preferred treatment. It is taken by mouth, or by injection into a vein or muscle. Effects generally begin within an hour and last for about six hours.
Common side effects include dizziness, low blood pressure, low blood potassium, muscle cramps, and kidney problems. Other serious side effects may include hearing loss and low blood platelets. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic and works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys.
Bumetanide was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 270th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
It is used to treat swelling and high blood pressure. This includes swelling as a result of heart failure, liver failure, or kidney problems. For high blood pressure it is not a preferred treatment. It is taken by mouth, or by injection into a vein or muscle.

==Side effects==
Common side effects include dizziness, low blood pressure, low blood potassium, muscle cramps, and kidney problems. Other serious side effects may include hearing loss and low blood platelets. A large observational study concluded that people with a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy may be allergic to sulfonamide non-antibiotics, such as bumetanide, but this is likely due to certain people being at an increased risk in general to developing allergic reactions rather than cross-reactivity between sulfonamide-containing drugs. In smaller studies, the lack of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfonamide non-antibiotics has been demonstrated. 

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Bumetanide is a loop diuretic and works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys.
The main difference between bumetanide and furosemide is in their bioavailability and potency. About 60% of furosemide is absorbed in the intestine, and there are substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). About 80% of bumetanide is absorbed, and its absorption does not change when it is taken with food. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect. Bumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide for people with normal renal function.

==Synthesis==
Bumetanide is synthesized from 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In the first stage of synthesis, it undergoes sulfonylchlorination by chlorosulfonic acid, forming 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonylbenzoic acid, which is further nitrated with nitric acid to 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonyl-5-nitrobenzoic acid. Reacting this with ammonia gives 5-aminosulfonyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, which when reacted with sodium phenolate is transformed into 5-amino-sulfonyl-3-nitro-5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Reduction of the nitro group in this product by hydrogen using a palladium on carbon catalyst gives 3-amino-5-aminosulfonyl-5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Finally, reacting this with butyl alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid, followed by treatment with sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the butyl ester, gives the desired bumetanide.


== Society and culture ==
It 2008, ESPN reported that four NFL players were being suspended under the steroid policy as a result of taking bumetanide.

Bumetanide was an undisclosed active ingredient in the over-the-counter weight loss supplement StarCaps, which was removed from the market after its presence was discovered by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

==Research==
In the brain, bumetanide blocks the NKCC1 cation-chloride co-transporter, and thus decreases internal chloride concentration in neurons. In turn, this concentration change makes the action of GABA more hyperpolarizing, which may be useful for treatment of neonatal seizures, which quite often are not responsive to traditional GABA-targeted treatment, such as barbiturates. Bumetanide is therefore under evaluation as a prospective antiepileptic drug. 

The drug has also been studied as a treatment for autism.

<doc id="973969" wikidata="Q779933" url="?curid=973969" title="Edicts of Ashoka">
<text>The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of more than thirty inscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka, as well as boulders and cave walls, attributed to Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire who ruled most of the Indian subcontinent from 268 BCE to 232 BCE. Ashoka used the expression &quot;Dhaṃma Lipi&quot; (Prakrit in the Brahmi script: , &quot;Inscriptions of the Dharma&quot;) to describe his own Edicts. These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and provide the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail Ashoka&#x27;s policy on dhamma, an earnest attempt to solve some of the problems that a complex society faced. According to the edicts, the extent of his promotion of &quot;dhamma&quot; during this period reached as far as the Greeks in the Mediterranean region. While the inscriptions mention the conversion of Ashoka to Buddhism, the &quot;dhamma&quot; that he promotes is largely ecumenical and non-sectarian in nature. As historian Romila Thapar relates: In his edicts Aśoka defines the main principles of &quot;dhamma&quot; as non-violence, tolerance of all sects and opinions, obedience to parents, respect to brahmins and other religious teachers and priests, liberality toward friends, humane treatment of servants and generosity towards all. It suggests a general ethic of behaviour to which no religious or social group could object. It also could act as a focus of loyalty to weld together the diverse strands that made up the empire. Interestingly, the Greek versions of these edicts translate &quot;dhamma&quot; as &quot;eusebeia&quot; (piety) and no mention is made anywhere of the teachings of the Buddha, as would be expected if Aśoka had been propagating Buddhism.’The inscriptions show his efforts to develop the &quot;dhamma&quot; throughout his empire. Although Buddhism as well as Gautama Buddha are mentioned, the edicts focus on social and moral precepts rather than specific religious practices or the philosophical dimension of Buddhism. These were located in public places and were meant for people to read.

In these inscriptions, Ashoka refers to himself as &quot;Beloved of the Gods&quot; (&quot;Devanampiya&quot;). The identification of Devanampiya with Ashoka was confirmed by an inscription discovered in 1915 by C. Beadon, a British gold-mining engineer, at Maski, a town in Madras Presidency (present day Raichur district, Karnataka). Another minor rock edict, found at the village in Gwalior State (present day Datia district of Madhya Pradesh), also used the name of Ashoka together with his titles: &quot;Devanampiya Piyadasi Asokaraja&quot;. The inscriptions found in the central and eastern part of India were written in Magadhi Prakrit using the Brahmi script, while Prakrit using the Kharoshthi script, Greek and Aramaic were used in the northwest. These edicts were deciphered by British archaeologist and historian James Prinsep.

The inscriptions revolve around a few recurring themes: Ashoka&#x27;s conversion to Buddhism, the description of his efforts to spread &quot;dhamma&quot;, his moral and religious precepts, and his social and animal welfare program. The edicts were based on Ashoka&#x27;s ideas on administration and behavior of people towards one another and religion.

==Decipherment==
Besides a few inscriptions in Greek and Aramaic (which were discovered only in the 20th century), the Edicts were mostly written in the Brahmi script and sometimes in the Kharoshthi script in the northwest, two Indian scripts which had both become extinct around the 5th century CE, and were yet undeciphered at the time the Edicts were discovered and investigated in the 19th century.

The first successful attempts at deciphering the ancient Brahmi script were made in 1836 by Norwegian scholar Christian Lassen, who used the bilingual Greek-Brahmi coins of Indo-Greek king Agathocles to correctly and securely identify several Brahmi letters. The task was then completed by James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the East India Company, who was able to identify the rest of the Brahmi characters, with the help of Major Cunningham. In a series of results that he published in March 1838 Prinsep was able to translate the inscriptions on a large number of rock edicts found around India, and to provide, according to Richard Salomon, a &quot;virtually perfect&quot; rendering of the full Brahmi alphabet. The edicts in Brahmi script mentioned a King Devanampriya Piyadasi which Prinsep initially assumed was a Sri Lankan king. He was then able to associate this title with Ashoka on the basis of Pali script from Sri Lanka communicated to him by George Turnour.

The Kharoshthi script, written from right to left, and associated with Aramaic, was also deciphered by James Prinsep in parallel with Christian Lassen, using the bilingual Greek-Kharoshthi coinage of the Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythian kings. &quot;Within the incredibly brief space of three years (1834-37) the mystery of both the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts (were unlocked), the effect of which was instantly to remove the thick crust of oblivion which for many centuries had concealed the character and the language of the earliest epigraphs&quot;.

==The Edicts==

The Edicts are divided into four categories, according to their size (Minor or Major) and according to their medium (Rock or Pillar). Chronologically, the minor inscriptions tend to precede the larger ones, while rock inscriptions generally seem to have been started earlier than the pillar inscriptions:
* Minor Rock Edicts: Edicts inscribed at the beginning of Ashoka&#x27;s reign; in Prakrit, Greek and Aramaic.
* Minor Pillar Edicts: Schism Edict, Queen&#x27;s Edict, Rummindei Edict, Nigali Sagar Edict; in Prakrit.
* Major Rock Edicts: 14 Edicts (termed 1st to 14th) and 2 separate ones found in Odisha; in Prakrit and Greek.
* Major Pillar Edicts: 7 Edicts, inscribed at the end of Ashoka&#x27;s reign; in Prakrit.

;General content
The Minor Rock Edicts (in which Ashoka is sometimes named in person, as in Maski and Gujarra) as well as the Minor Pillar Edicts are very religious in their content: they mention extensively the Buddha (and even previous Buddhas as in the Nigali Sagar inscription), the Sangha, Buddhism and Buddhist scriptures (as in the Bairat Temple Edict).

On the contrary, the Major Rock Edicts and Major Pillar Edicts are essentially moral and political in nature: they never mention the Buddha or explicit Buddhist teachings, but are preoccupied with order, proper behavior and non violence under the general concept of &quot;Dharma&quot;, and they also focus on the administration of the state and positive relations with foreign countries as far as the Hellenistic Mediterranean of the mid-3rd century BCE.

===Minor Rock Edicts===
The Minor Rock Edicts of Ashoka (r.269-233 BCE) are rock inscriptions which form the earliest part of the Edicts of Ashoka. They predate Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edicts.

Chronologically, the first known edict, sometimes classified as a Minor Rock Edict, is the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription, in Greek and in Aramaic, written in the 10th year of his reign (260 BCE) at the border of his empire with the Hellenistic world, in the city of Old Kandahar in modern Afghanistan.

Ashoka then made the first edicts in the Indian language, written in the Brahmi script, from the 11th year of his reign (according to his own inscription, &quot;two and a half years after becoming a secular Buddhist&quot;, i.e. two and a half years at least after returning from the Kalinga conquest of the eighth year of his reign, which is the starting point for his remorse towards the horrors of the war, and his gradual conversion to Buddhism). The texts of the inscriptions are rather short, the technical quality of the engraving of the inscriptions is generally very poor, and generally very inferior to the pillar edicts dated to the years 26 and 27 of Ashoka&#x27;s reign.

There are several slight variations in the content of these edicts, depending on location, but a common designation is usually used, with Minor Rock Edict N°1 (MRE1) and a Minor Rock Edict N°2 (MRE2, which does not appear alone but always in combination with Edict N°1), the different versions being generally aggregated in most translations. The Maski version of Minor Rock Edict No.1 is historically particularly important in that it confirmed the association of the title &quot;Devanampriya&quot; with the name &quot;Asoka&quot;, thereby clarifying the historical author of all these inscriptions. In the Gujarra version of Minor Rock Edict No.1 also, the name of Ashoka is used together with his full title: &quot;Devanampiya Piyadasi Asokaraja&quot;.

There is also a unique Minor Rock Edict No.3, discovered next to Bairat Temple, for the Buddhist clergy, which gives a list of Buddhist scriptures (most of them unknown today) which the clergy should study regularly.

A few other inscriptions of Ashoka in Aramaic, which are not strictly edicts, but tend to share a similar content, are sometimes also categorized as &quot;Minor Rock Edicts&quot;. The dedicatory inscriptions of the Barabar caves are also sometimes classified among the Minor Rock Edicts of Ashoka.

The Minor Rock Edicts can be found throughout the territory of Ashoka, including in the frontier area near the Hindu Kush, and are especially numerous in the southern, newly conquered, frontier areas of Karnataka and southern Andhra Pradesh.

===Minor Pillar Edicts===
The Minor Pillar Edicts of Ashoka refer to five separate minor Edicts inscribed on columns, the Pillars of Ashoka. These edicts are preceded chronologically by the Minor Rock Edicts and may have been made in parallel with the Major Rock Edicts.

The inscription technique is generally very poor compared for example to the later Major Pillar Edicts, however the Minor Pillar Edicts are often associated with some of the artistically most sophisticated pillar capitals of Ashoka, such as the Lion Capital of Ashoka, which crowned the Sarnath Minor Pillar Edict, or the very similar, but less well-preserved Sanchi lion capital, which crowned the very clumsily inscribed Schism Edict of Sanchi. According to Irwin, the Brahmi inscriptions on the Sarnath and Sanchi pillars were made by inexperienced Indian engravers at a time when stone engraving was still new in India, whereas the very refined Sarnath capital itself was made under the tutelage of craftsmen from the former Achaemenid Empire, trained in Perso-Hellenistic statuary and employed by Ashoka. This suggests that the most sophisticated capitals were actually the earliest in the sequence of Ashokan pillars and that style degraded over a short period of time.

These edicts were probably made at the beginning of the reign of Ashoka (reigned 268-232 BCE), from the year 12 of his reign, that is, from 256 BCE.

The Minor Pillar Edicts are the Schism Edict, warning of punishment for dissent in the Samgha, the Queen&#x27;s Edict, and the Rummindei Edict as well as the Nigali Sagar Edict which record Ashoka&#x27;s visits and Buddhist dedications in the area corresponding to today&#x27;s Nepal. The Rummindei and Nigali Sagar edicts, inscribed on pillars erected by Ashoka later in his reign (19th and 20th year) display a high level of inscriptional technique with a good regularity in the lettering.

===Major Rock Edicts===
The Major Rock Edicts of Ashoka refer to 14 separate major Edicts, which are significantly detailed and extensive. These Edicts were concerned with practical instructions in running the empire such as the design of irrigation systems and descriptions of Ashoka&#x27;s beliefs in peaceful moral behavior. They contain little personal detail about his life. These edicts are preceded chronologically by the Minor Rock Edicts.

Three languages were used, Prakrit, Greek and Aramaic. The edicts are composed in non-standardized and archaic forms of Prakrit. Prakrit inscriptions were written in Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts, which even a commoner could read and understand. The inscriptions found in the area of Pakistan are in the Kharoshthi script. Other Edicts are written in Greek or Aramaic. The Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka (including portions of Edict No.13 and No.14) is in Greek only, and originally probably contained all the Major Rock Edicts 1-14.

The Major Rock Edicts of Ashoka are inscribed on large rocks, except for the Kandahar version in Greek (Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka), written on a stone plaque belonging to a building. The Major Edicts are not located in the heartland of Mauryan territory, traditionally centered on Bihar, but on the frontiers of the territory controlled by Ashoka.

===Major Pillar Edicts===
The Major Pillar Edicts of Ashoka refer to seven separate major Edicts inscribed on columns, the Pillars of Ashoka, which are significantly detailed and extensive.

These edicts are preceded chronologically by the Minor Rock Edicts and the Major Rock Edicts, and constitute the most technically elegant of the inscriptions made by Ashoka. They were made at the end of his reign, from the years 26 and 27 of his reign, that is, from 237 to 236 BCE. Chronologically they follow the fall of Seleucid power in Central Asia and the related rise of the Parthian Empire and the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom circa 250 BCE. Hellenistic rulers are not mentioned anymore in these last edicts, as they only appear in Major Rock Edict No.13 (and to a lesser extent Major Rock Edict No.2), which can be dated to about the 14th year of the reign of Ashoka circa 256–255. The last Major Pillar Edicts (Edict No.7) is testamental in nature, making a summary of the accomplishments of Ashoka during his life.

The Major Pillar Edicts of Ashoka were exclusively inscribed on the Pillars of Ashoka or fragments thereof, at Kausambi (now Allahabad Pillar), Topra Kalan, Meerut, Lauriya-Araraj, Lauria Nandangarh, Rampurva (Champaran), and fragments of these in Aramaic (Kandahar, Edict No.7 and Pul-i-Darunteh, Edict No.5 or No.7 in Afghanistan) However several pillars, such as the bull pillar of Rampurva, or the pillar of Vaishali do not have inscriptions, which, together with their lack of proper foundation stones and their particular style, led some authors to suggest that they were in fact pre-Ashokan.

The Major Pillar Edicts (excluding the two fragments of translations found in modern Afghanistan) are all located in Central India.

The Pillars of Ashoka are stylistically very close to an important Buddhist monument, also built by Ashoka in Bodh Gaya, at the location where the Buddha had reached enlightenment some 200 years earlier: the Diamond Throne. The sculpted decorations on the Diamond Throne clearly echo the decorations found on the Pillars of Ashoka. The Pillars dated to the end of Ashoka&#x27;s reign are associated with pillar capitals that tend to be more solemn and less elegant than the earlier capitals, such as those of Sanchi or Sarnath. This led some authors to suggest that the artistic level under Ashoka tended to fall towards the end of his reign.

==Languages of the Edicts==
Three languages were used: Ashokan Prakrit, Greek (the language of the neighbouring Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Greek communities in Ashoka&#x27;s realm) and Aramaic (an official language of the former Achaemenid Empire). The Prakrit displayed local variations, from early Gandhari language in the northwest, to Old Ardhamagadhi in the east, where it was the &quot;chancery language&quot; of the court. The language level of the Prakrit inscriptions tends to be rather informal or colloquial. 

Four scripts were used. Prakrit inscriptions were written in the Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts, the latter for the area of modern Pakistan. The Greek and Aramaic inscriptions used their respective scripts, in the northwestern areas of Ashoka&#x27;s territory, in modern Pakistan and Afghanistan.

While most Edicts were in Ashokan Prakrit, a few were written in Greek or Aramaic. The Kandahar Rock Inscription is bilingual Greek-Aramaic. The Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka is in Greek only, and originally probably contained all the Major Rock Edicts 1-14. The Greek language used in the inscription is of a very high level and displays philosophical refinement. It also displays an in-depth understanding of the political language of the Hellenic world in the 3rd century BCE. This suggests a highly cultured Greek presence in Kandahar at that time.

By contrast, in the rock edicts engraved in southern India in the newly conquered territories of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, Ashoka only used the Prakrit of the North as the language of communication, with the Brahmi script, and not the local Dravidian idiom, which can be interpreted as a kind of authoritarianism in respect to the southern territories.

Ashoka&#x27;s edicts were the first written inscriptions in India after the ancient city of Harrapa fell to ruin. Due to the influence of Ashoka&#x27;s Prakrit inscriptions, Prakrit would remain the main inscriptional language for the following centuries, until the rise of inscriptional Sanskrit from the 1st century CE.

==Content of the Edicts==
The Dharma preached by Ashoka is explained mainly in term of moral precepts, based on the doing of good deeds, respect for others, generosity and purity. The expressions used by Ashoka to express the Dharma, were the Prakrit word &quot;Dhaṃma&quot;, the Greek word &quot;Eusebeia&quot; (in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription and the Kandahar Greek Edict of Ashoka), and the Aramaic word &quot;Qsyt&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;) (in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription).

===Empire boundaries===
The initial translation of this Edict by James Prinsep differs from that of E. Hultzsch. His translation is as follows:

===Moral precepts===
; Right behaviour

; Benevolence
Ashoka&#x27;s Dharma meant that he used his power to try to make life better for his people and he also tried to change the way people thought and lived. He also thought that dharma meant doing the right thing.

; Kindness to prisoners
Ashoka showed great concern for fairness in the exercise of justice, caution and tolerance in the application of sentences, and regularly pardoned prisoners.

; Respect for animal life

The Mauryan Empire was the first Indian empire to unify most of the country and it had a clear-cut policy of exploiting as well as protecting natural resources with specific officials tasked with protection duty. When Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the imperial hunt. He was perhaps the first ruler in history to advocate conservation measures for wildlife. Reference to these can be seen inscribed on the stone edicts.



Ashoka advocated restraint in the number that had to be killed for consumption, protected some of them, and in general condemned violent acts against animals, such as castration.

However, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 &#x27;panas&#x27; (coins) fine for poaching deer in imperial hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices then freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.

===Religious precepts===
;Buddhism
Explicit mentions of Buddhism or the Buddha only appear in the Minor Rock Edicts and the Minor Pillar Edicts. Beyond affirming himself as a Buddhist and spreading the moral virtues of Buddhism, Ashoka also insisted that the word of the Buddha be read and followed, in particular in monastic circles (the Sanghas), in a unique edict (Minor Rock Edict No.3), found in front of the Bairat Temple



Ashoka also expressed his devotion for the Buddhas of the past, such as the Koṇāgamana Buddha, for whom he enlarged a stupa in the 14th year of his reign, and made a dedication and set up a pillar during a visit in person in the 20th year of his reign, as described in his Minor Pillar Edict of Nigali Sagar, in modern Nepal.

;Belief in a next world


; Religious exchange

Far from being sectarian, Ashoka, based on a belief that all religions shared a common, positive essence, encouraged tolerance and understanding of other religions.

===Social and animal welfare===
According to the edicts, Ashoka took great care of the welfare of his subjects (human and animal), and those beyond his borders, spreading the use of medicinal treatments, improving roadside facilities for more comfortable travel, and establishing &quot;officers of the faith&quot; throughout his territories to survey the welfare of the population and the propagation of the Dharma. The Greek king Antiochos (&quot;the Yona king named Antiyoga&quot; in the text of the Edicts) is also named as a recipient of Ashoka&#x27;s generosity, together with the other kings neighbouring him.

; Medicinal treatments



; Roadside facilities
; Officers of the faith
; Birthplace of the historical Buddha

In a particularly famous Edict, the Rummindei Edict in Lumbini, Nepal, Ashoka describes his visit in the 21st year of his reign, and mentions Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha. He also, for the first time in historical records, uses the epithet &quot;Sakyamuni&quot; (Sage of the Shakyas), to describe the historical Buddha.

==Ashoka&#x27;s proselytism according to the Edicts==
In order to propagate welfare, Ashoka explains that he sent emissaries and medicinal plants to the Hellenistic kings as far as the Mediterranean, and to people throughout India, claiming that Dharma had been achieved in all their territories as well. He names the Greek rulers of the time, inheritors of the conquest of Alexander the Great, from Bactria to as far as Greece and North Africa, as recipients of the Dharma, displaying a clear grasp of the political situation at the time.

===Proselytism beyond India===
The distance of 600 yojanas (&gt; 2,000 km) corresponds roughly to the distance between the center of India and Greece.

In the Gandhari original Antiochos is referred to as &quot;Amtiyoge nama Yona-raja&quot; (lit. &quot;The Greek king by the name of Antiokos&quot;), beyond whom live the four other kings: &quot;param ca tena Atiyogena cature 4 rajani Tulamaye nama Amtekine nama Makā nama Alikasudaro nama&quot; (lit. &quot;And beyond Antiochus, four kings by the name of Ptolemy, the name of Antigonos, the name of Magas, the name Alexander&quot;.

* Amtiyaka () or Amtiyoga (𑀅𑀁𑀢𑀺𑀕), refers to Antiochus II Theos (261–246 BCE), King of the Seleucid Empire from Syria to Bactria in the east from 305 to 250 BCE, and was therefore a direct neighbor of Ashoka.
* Tulamāya () refers to Ptolemy II Philadelphos of Egypt (285–247 BCE), king of the dynasty founded by Ptolemy I, a former general of Alexander the Great, in Egypt.
* Amtekina () refers to Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia (278–239 BCE).
* Makā (𑀫𑀓𑀸) refers to Magas of Cyrene (300–258 BCE).
* Alikyaṣadala (𑀅𑀁𑀮𑀺𑀱𑀤𑀮) refers to Alexander II of Epirus (272–258 BCE).

All the kings mentioned in Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edict No.13 are famous Hellenistic rulers, contemporary of Ashoka:

; Emissaries

It is not clear in Hellenic records whether these emissaries were actually received, or had any influence on the Hellenic world. But the existence of the edicts in a very high-level Greek literary and philosophical language testifies to the high sophistication of the Greek community of Kandahar, and to a true communication between Greek intellectuals and Indian thought. According to historian Louis Robert, it becomes quite likely that these Kandahar Greeks who were very familiar with Indian culture could in turn transmit Indian ideas to the philosophical circles of the Mediterranean world, in Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria, Pella or Cyrene. He suggests that the famous Ashoka emissaries sent to the Western Hellenistic Courts according to Ashoka&#x27;s Major Rock Edict No.13 were in fact Greek subjects and citizens of Kandahar, who had the full capacity to carry out these embassies.

Another document, the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; (XII, 1st paragraph), also states that in the 17th year of his reign, at the end of the Third Buddhist Council, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to eight parts of Southern Asia and the &quot;country of the Yonas&quot; (Greeks) to propagate Buddhism.

;Presence in the West
Overall, the evidence for the presence of Buddhists in the west from that time is very meager. But some scholars point to the possible presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world, in particular in Alexandria. Dio Chrysostum wrote to Alexandrians that there are &quot;Indians who view the spectacles with you and are with you on all occasions&quot; (Oratio.XXXII.373). According to Ptolemy also, Indians were present in Alexandria, to whom he was much indebted for his knowledge of India (As.Res.III.53). Clement of Alexandria too mentioned the presence of Indians in Alexandria. A possible Buddhist gravestone from the Ptolemaic period has been found by Flinders Petrie, decorated with a depiction of what may be Dharmachakra and Trishula. According to the 11th century Muslim historian Al-Biruni, before the advent of Islam, Buddhists were present in Western Asia as far as the frontiers of Syria.

; Possible influences on Western thought

Colonial era scholars such as Rhys Davids have attributed Ashoka&#x27;s claims of &quot;Dharmic conquest&quot; to mere vanity, and expressed disbelief that Greeks could have been in any way influenced by Indian thought.

But numerous authors have noted the parallels between Buddhism, Cyrenaicism and Epicureanism, which all strive for a state of ataraxia (&quot;equanimity&quot;) away from the sorrows of life. The positions of philosophers such as Hegesias of Cyrene were close to Buddhism, his ideas recalling the Buddhist doctrine of suffering: he lived in the city of Cyrene where Magas ruled, the same Magas under whom the Dharma prospered according to Ashoka, and he may have been influenced by Ashoka&#x27;s missionaries.

The religious communities of the Essenes of Palestine and the Therapeutae of Alexandria may also have been communities based on the model of Buddhist monasticism, following Ashoka&#x27;s missions. According to semitologist André Dupont-Sommer, speaking about the consequences of Ashoka&#x27;s proselytism: &quot;It is India which would be, according to us, at the beginning of this vast monastic current which shone with a strong brightness during about three centuries in Judaism itself&quot;. This influence would even contribute, according to André Dupont-Sommer, to the emergence of Christianity: &quot;Thus was prepared the ground on which Christianity, that sect of Jewish origin influenced by the Essenes, which was so quickly and so powerfully to conquer a very large part of the world.&quot;

===Proselytism within Ashoka&#x27;s territories===
Inside India proper, in the empire of Ashoka, many different populations were the object of the emperor&#x27;s proselytism. Greek communities also lived in the northwest of the Mauryan Empire, currently in Pakistan, notably ancient Gandhara, and in the region of Gedrosia, nowadays in Southern Afghanistan, following the conquest and the colonization efforts of Alexander the Great around 323 BCE. These communities therefore seem to have been still significant during the reign of Ashoka. The Kambojas are a people of Central Asian origin who had settled first in Arachosia and Drangiana (today&#x27;s southern Afghanistan), and in some of the other areas in the northwestern Indian subcontinent in Sindh, Gujarat and Sauvira. The Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas were other people under Ashoka&#x27;s rule:

==Influences==
===Achaemenid inscriptional tradition===

The inscriptions of Ashoka may show Achaemenid influences, including formulaic parallels with Achaemenid inscriptions, presence of Iranian loanwords (in Aramaic inscriptions), and the very act of engraving edicts on rocks and mountains (compare for example Behistun inscription). To describe his own Edicts, Ashoka used the word &quot;Lipī&quot; (), now generally simply translated as &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;inscription&quot;. It is thought the word &quot;lipi&quot;, which is also orthographed &quot;dipi&quot; (𐨡𐨁𐨤𐨁) in the two Kharosthi versions of the rock edicts, comes from an Old Persian prototype &quot;dipî&quot; () also meaning &quot;inscription&quot;, which is used for example by Darius I in his Behistun inscription, suggesting borrowing and diffusion. There are other borrowings of Old Persian terms for writing-related words in the Edicts of Ahoka, such as &quot;nipista&quot; or &quot;nipesita&quot; (𐨣𐨁𐨤𐨁𐨯𐨿𐨟, &quot;written&quot; and &quot;made to be written&quot;) in the Kharoshthi version of Major Rock Edict No.4, which can be related to the word &quot;nipištā&quot; (𐎴𐎡𐎱𐎡𐏁𐎫𐎠, &quot;written&quot;) from the &quot;daiva&quot; inscription of Xerxes I at Persepolis.

===Hellenistic inscriptions===
It has also been suggested that inscriptions bearing the Delphic maxims from the Seven Sages of Greece, inscribed by philosopher Clearchus of Soli in the neighbouring city of Ai-Khanoum circa 300 BCE, may have influenced the writings of Ashoka. These Greek inscriptions, located in the central square of Ai-Khanoum, put forward traditional Greek moral rules which are very close to the Edicts, both in term of formulation and content.

===Ancestor of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system===
The first examples of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system appeared in the Brahmi numerals used in the Edicts of Ashoka, in which a few numerals are found, although the system is not yet positional (the zero, together with a mature positional system, was invented much later around the 6th century CE) and involves different symbols for units, dozens or hundreds. This system is later further documented with more numerals in the Nanaghat inscriptions (1st century BCE), and later in the Nasik Caves inscriptions (2nd century CE), to acquire designs which are largely similar to the Hindu–Arabic numerals used today.

The number &quot;6&quot; in particular appears in Minor Rock Edict No.1 when Ashoka explains he has &quot;been on tour for 256 days&quot;. The evolution to the modern glyph for 6 appears rather straightforward. It was written in one stroke, somewhat like a cursive lowercase &quot;e&quot;. Gradually, the upper part of the stroke (above the central squiggle) became more curved, while the lower part of the stroke (below the central squiggle) became straighter. The Arabs dropped the part of the stroke below the squiggle. From there, the European evolution to the modern 6 was very straightforward, aside from a flirtation with a glyph that looked more like an uppercase G.

===Influence on the Indian epigraphy===
Ashokan inscriptions in Prakrit precede by several centuries inscriptions in Sanskrit, probably owing to the great prestige which Ashokan inscriptions gave to the Prakrit language. Louis Renou called it &quot;the great linguistical paradox of India&quot; that the Sanskrit inscriptions appear later than Prakrit inscriptions, although Prakrit is considered as a descendant of the Sanskrit language.

Ashoka was probably the first Indian ruler to create stone inscriptions, and in doing so, he began an important Indian tradition of royal epigraphical inscriptions. The earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE. These early Sanskrit inscriptions include the Ayodhyā (Uttar Pradesh) and Hāthībādā-Ghosuṇḍī (near Chittorgarh, Rajasthan) inscriptions. Other important inscriptions dated to the 1st century BCE, in relatively accurate classical Sanskrit and Brahmi script are the Yavanarajya inscription on a red sandstone slab and the long Naneghat inscription on the wall of a cave rest stop in the Western Ghats. Besides these few examples from the 1st century BCE, the bulk of early Sanskrit inscriptions were made from the 1st and 2nd-century CE by the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh), and the Western Satraps in Gujarat and Maharashtra. According to Salomon, the Scythian rulers of northern and western India while not the originators, were promoters of the use of Sanskrit language for inscriptions, and &quot;their motivation in promoting Sanskrit was presumably a desire to establish themselves as legitimate Indian or at least Indianized rulers and to curry the favor of the educated Brahmanical elite&quot;.

The Brahmi script used in the Edicts of Ashoka, as well as the Prakrit language of these inscriptions was in popular use down through the Kushan period, and remained readable down to the 4th century CE during the Gupta period. After that time the script underwent significant evolutions which rendered the Ashokan inscriptions unreadable. This still means that Ashoka&#x27;s Edicts were for everyone to see and understand for a period of nearly 700 years in India, suggesting that they remained significantly influential for a long time.

==Later mention==
The Chinese traveller Fa Hian in his writings refers to one of Ashoka&#x27;s edicts in Ni-li city. However, the specific edict mentioned by Fa-Hien has not yet been discovered.On the surface of this pillar is an inscription to the following effect:
&quot;“King Asoka presented the whole of Jambudvipa to the priests of the four quarters, and redeemed it again with money, and tins he did three times.”&quot;
Three or four hundred paces to the north of the pagoda is the spot where Asoka was horn (or resided). On this spot he raised the city of Ni-li, and in the midst of it erected a stone pillar, also about 35 feet in height, on the top of which he placed the figure of a lion, and also engraved an historical record on the pillar giving an account of the successive events connected with Ni-li, with the corresponding year, day, and month.&lt;br&gt;— Chapter XXVII , The travels of Fa Hian (400 A.D.)

==Questions of authorship==

According to some scholars such as Christopher I. Beckwith, Ashoka, whose name only appears in the Minor Rock Edicts, should be differentiated from the King Piyadasi, or &quot;Devanampiya&quot; Piyadasi (i.e. &quot;Beloved of the Gods Piyadasi&quot;, &quot;Beloved of the Gods&quot; being a fairly widespread title for &quot;King&quot;), who is named as the author of the Major Pillar Edicts and the Major Rock Edicts. Beckwith also highlights the fact that neither Buddhism nor the Buddha are mentioned in the Major Edicts, but only in the Minor Edicts. Further, the Buddhist notions described in the Minor Edicts (such as the Buddhist canonical writings in Minor Edict No.3 at Bairat Temple, the mention of a Buddha of the past Kanakamuni Buddha in the Nigali Sagar Minor Pillar Edict) are more characteristic of the &quot;Normative Buddhism&quot; of the Saka-Kushan period around the 2nd century CE.

Beckwith proposed that possibly Piyadasi and Ashoka were two different rulers. According to Beckwith, Piyadasi was living in the 3rd century BCE, probably the son of Chandragupta Maurya known to the Greeks as Amitrochates, and only advocating for piety (&quot;Dharma&quot;) in his Major Pillar Edicts and Major Rock Edicts, without ever mentioning Buddhism, the Buddha or the Samgha. Since he does mention a pilgrimage to &quot;Sambhodi&quot; (Bodh Gaya, in Major Rock Edict No.8) however, he may have adhered to an &quot;early, pietistic, popular&quot; form of Buddhism. Also, the geographical spread of his inscription shows that Piyadasi ruled a vast Empire, contiguous with the Seleucid Empire in the West.

On the contrary, for Beckwith, Ashoka himself was a later king of the 1st-2nd century CE, whose name only appears explicitly in the Minor Rock Edicts and allusively in the Minor Pillar Edicts, and who does mention the Buddha and the Samgha, explicitly promoting Buddhism. He may have been an unknown or possibly invented ruler named Devanampriya Asoka, with the intent of propagating a later, more institutional version of the Buddhist faith. His inscriptions cover a very different and much smaller geographical area, clustering in Central India. According to Beckwith, the inscriptions of this later Ashoka were typical of the later forms of &quot;normative Buddhism&quot;, which are well attested from inscriptions and Gandhari manuscripts dated to the turn of the millennium, and around the time of the Kushan Empire. The quality of the inscriptions of this Ashoka is significantly lower than the quality of the inscriptions of the earlier Piyadasi.

However, many of Beckwith&#x27;s methodologies and interpretations concerning early Buddhism, inscriptions, and archaeological sites have been criticized by other scholars, such as Johannes Bronkhorst and Osmund Bopearachchi.

<text>Ruby Records is an American record label, founded predominantly as a rock music label subsidiary of Slash Records. The original version of the label released seven albums in 1981 and 1982.

Ruby was distributed through the same independent distributors that handled its corporate parent, Slash. When Warner Bros. Records bought Slash, they took over distribution of Ruby&#x27;s three most popular albums (The Gun Club&#x27;s &quot;Fire of Love&quot;, The Misfits&#x27; &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;, The Dream Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;) and deleted the others (which included releases by the Flesh Eaters, Blurt and Lydia Lunch). The WB-distributed version of &quot;Fire of Love&quot; has an altered cover design, but the CD reissues on Slash and Rhino use the original artwork. Ruby was founded by the Flesh Eaters singer Chris D. He was listed as producer of the Misfits&#x27; &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; LP on its original release, although this was amended for the CD reissue. Chris D. also produced The Dream Syndicate&#x27;s &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot; and some tracks on The Gun Club&#x27;s &quot;Fire of Love&quot;, as well as the two Flesh Eaters albums released by Ruby.

After the Chris D. era, the Ruby label received some brief revivals. In 1989, it released albums by Sweet Baby and Field Trip. In 2012, Drag News released a self-titled EP on Ruby. In 2018, Prayers collaborated with the surviving members of Christian Death to release a limited edition single on Ruby. Ruby has also released an album by Mississippi Fred McDowell and an EP by The Drab.

<text>Ådne Søndrål (born 10 May 1971) is a former Norwegian speed skater.

Søndrål, representing Hol IL, was one of the best 1500 m skaters through most of the 1990s. He placed 2nd in the 1992 Winter Olympics and 4th in the 1994 Olympics. He finally won Olympic gold when he won 1500 m in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, setting a new world record: 1:47.87. He was also one of the favourites for a 1000 m medal in 1998, but he got sick before this race and did not start. In the 2002 Winter Olympics he was the big favourite, but he dislocated both his shoulders in falls in the last two weeks before the Olympic races, and he was happy to win a bronze medal. This made his collection of Olympic medals complete - one of each colour, in addition to a 4th position.

He started his career as an allround speed skater, without much success in the international allround championships. From 1996, he specialized in 1000 m and 1500 m, and he placed 2nd on both distances at the first World Single Distance Championships. He also won the 1000 m World Cup this season. In 1999 he tried allround again and he achieved his best result, placing 6th in the World Allround Championships on home ground in Hamar, Norway.

His achievements also include 4 gold and 6 silver medals in the World Single Distance Championships, 30 World Cup wins (1 on the 500 m, 11 on the 1000 m and 18 on the 1500 m) and 4 World Cup titles (on the 1000 m in 1996 and on the 1500 m in 1999, 2000 and 2002), and the Oscar Mathisen Award in 1998. In March 1998 in Calgary, he broke his own 1500 m world record, setting it at 1:46.43. This record stood firm until Jakko Jan Leeuwangh broke it in January 2000.

For many years, his personal trainer was former Norwegian speed skater Tom Erik Oxholm.

At the 2002 Winter Olympics, he was elected by the athletes as an IOC member for a period of 4 years, replacing Johann Olav Koss as one of the athletes representatives.
