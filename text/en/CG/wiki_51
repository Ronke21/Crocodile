<text>John Henry Kinkead (December 10, 1826 – August 15, 1904) was an American businessman and politician who served as the third Governor of Nevada and the first Governor of the District of Alaska. Spending most of his life in the dry goods business, he was also Treasurer of Nevada Territory, a member of the Nevada Constitutional Convention in 1864, and the first United States official to hold office in Alaska.

==Biography==

===Background===
Kinkead was born in the now defunct town of Smithfield in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on October 10, 1826, to Catherine (Bushey) and James S. Kinkead. He attended elementary school in Zanesville, Ohio, and high school in Lancaster, Ohio. At age 18, Kinkead became a clerk at a dry goods store. In 1849, he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah where, with I. M. Livingston, he founded the dry goods firm Livingston &amp; Kinkead.

In 1854 Kinkead moved to California, working at various jobs before settling in Marysville. There, on January 1, 1856, he married Elizabeth Falls. The marriage produced no children. However, much later, they adopted a boy named Kahtz from Alaska. He died at the age of 12. During 1856, Kinkead attempted to establish a dry goods business in New York City. Unsuccessful in this effort, he returned to California at the end of the year. There Kinkead suffered a series of business setbacks.

===Early political career===
Prompted by the discovery of silver in the area, Kinkead moved to Carson City, Utah Territory. While operating his dry goods store, he became involved in the organization of Nevada Territory. Kinkead was appointed Nevada&#x27;s first Territorial Treasurer, a position he held from 1862 to 1864, and in 1864 served as a member of the Nevada Constitutional Convention.

By mid-1867, Kinkead was without work and journeyed to Alaska with the &quot;Occupancy&quot; Commission. As part of the commission, he witnessed the transfer of Alaska from Russian to American possession. He also became the first United States official to hold office in Alaska when he was appointed postmaster by President Andrew Johnson. In addition to his postal duties, Kinkead operated a trading post and served as Sitka, Alaska&#x27;s unofficial mayor.

===Governorships===
Kinkead returned to Nevada in 1871, settling in the town of Unionville. There he engaged in various milling, mining, and mercantile efforts within Humboldt and Lander counties. His efforts during this period included founding Washoe City, building smelters in Pleasant Valley and Austin, and becoming an early promoter for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad.

Running on the Republican ticket, Kinkead was elected Governor of Nevada for the term running from January 1, 1879, to January 1, 1883. He was an opponent of Chinese immigration, stating in his inaugural address that: 

While in office he supported mining efforts, creation of toll roads, and the interests of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. At the end of his term, the governor declined to run for reelection.

Acting on the recommendation of U.S. Senator John P. Jones, President Chester Arthur appointed Kinkead as governor of the new formed District of Alaska on July 4, 1884. Arriving at his new post in early September, his only gubernatorial report was submitted in October. In the report he asked for establishment of a legal code and creation of a tax collection agency for the district, a boat to allow the governor to travel within Alaska, expanded financial aid, and initiation of new mail services.

During his term, Kinkead suffered a broken arm and a stroke. He also had to deal with a rift between himself and influential Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson, who differed with the governor on the trustworthiness of the district&#x27;s mining interests. Upon the instigation of the Alaskan District Attorney, the missionary was arrested on trumped up charges. The resulting scandal gained national attention with the governor receiving a portion of the blame for the incident. Kinkead submitted his resignation on May 9, 1885.

After leaving office, Kinkead returned to Carson City, Nevada, and resumed his mining and mercantile efforts. He died on August 15, 1904, and was buried in the Lone Mountain Cemetery.

<text>Redshift-space distortions are an effect in observational cosmology where the spatial distribution of galaxies appears squashed and distorted when their positions are plotted as a function of their redshift rather than as a function of their distance. The effect is due to the peculiar velocities of the galaxies causing a Doppler shift in addition to the redshift caused by the cosmological expansion.

Redshift-space distortions (RSDs) manifest in two particular ways. The Fingers of God effect is where the galaxy distribution is elongated in redshift space, with an axis of elongation pointed toward the observer. It is caused by a Doppler shift associated with the random peculiar velocities of galaxies bound in structures such as clusters. The large velocities that lead to this effect are associated with the gravity of the cluster by means of the virial theorem; they change the observed redshifts of the galaxies in the cluster. The deviation from the Hubble&#x27;s law relationship between distance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate distance measurements.

A closely related effect is the Kaiser effect, in which the distortion is caused by the coherent motions of galaxies as they fall inwards towards the cluster center as the cluster assembles. Depending on the particular dynamics of the situation, the Kaiser effect usually leads not to an elongation, but an apparent flattening (&quot;pancakes of God&quot;), of the structure. It is a much smaller effect than the fingers of God, and can be distinguished by the fact that it occurs on larger scales.

The previous effects are a consequence of special relativity, and have been observed in real data. There are additional effects that arise from general relativity. One is gravitational redshift distortion, which arises from the net gravitational redshift, or blueshift, that is acquired when the photon climbs out of the gravitational potential well of the distant galaxy and then falls into the potential well of the Milky Way galaxy. This effect will make galaxies at a higher gravitational potential than Earth appear slightly closer, and galaxies at lower potential will appear farther away.

The other effects of general relativity on clustering statistics are observed when the light from a background galaxy passes near, or through, a closer galaxy or cluster. These two effects are the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) and gravitational lensing. ISW arises because large-scale gravitational potentials are decaying in time (due to dark energy), so that a photon passing through a low area of gravitational potential gains more energy on entry than it loses on exit, making the background galaxy appear closer. Gravitational lensing, unlike all of the previous effects, distorts the apparent position, and number, of background galaxies.

The RSDs measured in galaxy redshift surveys can be used as a cosmological probe in their own right, providing information on how structure formed in the Universe, and how gravity behaves on large scales.

<text>Hanatarashi (), meaning &quot;sniveler&quot; or &quot;snot-nosed&quot; in Japanese, was a noise band created by later Boredoms frontman Yamantaka Eye and featured Zeni Geva guitarist Mitsuru Tabata. The outfit was formed in Osaka, Japan in 1983 after Eye and Tabata met as stage hands at an Einstürzende Neubauten show. After the release of the first album, the &quot;I&quot; was dropped and the name became &quot;Hanatarash&quot;.

They used a variety of unusual noise-making objects, including power tools, drills, and heavy machinery.

==Live shows==
Hanatarash was notorious for their dangerous live shows. Some of the band&#x27;s most infamous shows included Eye cutting a dead cat in half with a machete, strapping a circular saw to his back and almost cutting his leg off, and destroying part of a venue with an excavator by driving it through the back wall and onto the stage.

At a 1985 show in Tokyo&#x27;s Superloft, the audience were required to fill out forms due to the possibility of harm caused by the show. The show was stopped due to Eye preparing to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage. The performance cost ¥600,000 (approximately $9,000 US) in repairs.

After several years of the intense live shows, Hanatarash was forbidden from performing at most venues, and were only allowed to return to live performances in the 1990s after Eye would agree to cease his destructive on-stage behavior.

<doc id="990096" wikidata="Q6942070" url="?curid=990096" title="Music of Eritrea">
<text>The music of Eritrea, is a diverse mix of traditional and popular styles originating from ancient to modern times. The nine major ethnic groups of Eritrea—Afar, Bilen, Hedareb, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Saho, Tigre and Tigrinya—celebrate autonomous music-making expressed through a rich heritage of vocalists, instrumentalists and activities within the country and throughout the international diaspora. The country&#x27;s music is informed by a range of ethnolinguistic group dynamics in the region, by its shared pre-colonial history with and revolutionized independence from Ethiopia, and by its exposure to globalized American music in the mid-twentieth century.

==Notable musicians==
Notable Eritrean musicians were Edris Wad Amir, Ibrahim Wad Goret, Edris M. Ali, Zainab Bashir, Fatima Ibrahim, Engineer Asgedom Woldemichael, Wad Asheikh, Yemane Baria, Osman Abderrehim, Alamin Abdeletif and Atowe Birhan Segid. Yemane Baria wrote one political song, and he was in jail. Also of note is Bereket Mengistab, who has had a lengthy career, and 1960s musicians Haile Ghebru and Tewolde Redda.

Modern popular stars include Wad Asheikh, Saeed salih, Fatima Ibrahim, Teklé Tesfa-Ezighe, Tekle Kiflemariam Wedi Tukul, Tesfai Mehari (Fihira), Osman Abderrehim, Abrar Osman, Abraham Afwerki, Yemane Ghebremichael, Alamin Abdeletif, Atewebrhan Segid, and Tsehaytu Beraki.

==Folk music==
Folk musicians used traditional instruments include the stringed kraar, kebero, lyre. Tesfuy Mehari Fihira and Wedi Sheik were notable folk musicians.

==Popular music==
Modern Eritrean popular music can be traced back to the late 1960s, when the MaHber Theatre Asmara began to produce stars like Osman Abderrehim, Alamin Abdeletif, Yemane Ghebremichael (commonly known as Yemane Baria), Jabber, Ateweberhan Seghid, Yonus Ibrahim, Tsehaytu Beraki, Tewolde Redda, Teberh Tesfahiwet and Tukabo Weldemariam.

Since then, some musicians, like kraar-player Dawit Shilan, Yohannes Tikabo (also known as Wedi Tukabo), Dehab Faytinga (commonly known as Faytinga), the Asmara All Stars and Temesgen Gebreselassie (also known as Taniqo) have helped to incorporate the core indigenous Eritrean musical elements in popular music.

==Dancing==

Traditional Eritrean Tigrinya dancing involves two main styles of dance. In the first which is called &#x27;quda&#x27;, the dancers form a circle and slowly circumambulator or move around in an endless circular motion to the rhythm of the music. Then, they cease the circular musical flow/motion and dance in pairs or 3&#x27;s facing each other for a short while before resuming the circular motion in a file again. During this time, they shuffle their feet to the beat of the music and bob their shoulders in a rhythmic fashion. Female dancers usually move their shoulders more than the male dancers. The dancers round off their dancing by facing each other in twos and threes and moving their shoulders faster. This can also involve jumping and bending one&#x27;s knees, as well as going down to the floor to sit in a squatting position while bobbing those shoulders and moving the head sideways to the strong drum beats.

In the second style of dance, two groups (often a group of men and a group of women) line up and face each other. The dance features a skipping step to the music. Periodically, the two groups will change places, dancing across the floor and passing each other in the process.

Traditional dances practiced by Eritrea&#x27;s other Afro-Asiatic communities include those by the Saho, which involve jumping on each leg in rhythm with the beat. The related Afar, Tigre, Bilen and Hidareb have similar moves. Additionally, the Rashaida also have their own unique dances.

Dancing by the Nilo-Saharan Kunama involves raising bead-strung legs in sync with the rhythm of the music. The related Nara have similar traditions.

==Live music: piano bars==
The music scene in the Eritrean capital of Asmara has traditionally been known for setting the standard of &quot;Tigrinya&quot; music for listeners in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The relatively recent &#x27;piano bar&#x27; phenomenon has been largely exclusive to Asmara because almost all contemporary musicians and singers live in the capital city.

The piano bar culture became popular around 2004, when leading singers such as Dawit Shilan played at the Ha.Ko.Se.E cafe. At the time - live music in bars being a new experience in the city - the cafe was overcrowded over weekends and many customers had to be turned away.

One of the intrinsic characteristics of the piano bars is that the artists remix a range of classic hits, instead of sticking to performing only their own songs. For example, Dawit Shilan playing Atewebrhan Segid&#x27;s 1970s jazz not only brought these classic song back to life, but showed his mastery of performance skills, particularly on the &quot;krar.&quot;

Piano bars have thus provided a platform for jazz and blues artists - and to a lesser extent the local dance music known as &quot;Guayla&quot;. They have become sites for musicians to show their artistry, as they are not bound by the typical demands for upbeat music for dancing.

After the success of gigs at the Ha.Ko.Se.E piano bar, other hotels and cafes were quick to catch on the business. Hotels such as Sunshine, Savana, Bologna cub and Ayele family have been hosting contemporary favourites such as Yohannes Tikabo, Tesfay Mengesha and Kahsai Haile regularly.

In 2013, the Berhe Aiba Hotel started a new type of live performance by giving prominence to musicians rather than singers. Jazz classics were played, with singers such as Yohannes Tikabo only featuring on certain songs. Some of the best talents in Eritrean music - like Shonqie, Fanjai, Chobie and Gidewon - were brought together as a band to provide a unique experience. The place became a hangout for many musicians, who would get often on stage and jam.

The success of piano bars in Asmara could also be connected with the &quot;Gaeda&quot; genre, which is played in Swa houses in Aba Shawel, a district of Asmara that has traditionally been home to many notable artists across generations. &quot;Gaeda&quot; is a communal music experience where a singer plays songs accompanied by friends beating drums, clapping and singing along. Many of these songs are exclusively played in &quot;Gaeda&quot; settings and are never recorded or released on albums. Songs are often modified by whoever sings them, adding thought-provoking social and political messages.

==Sibrit==
In 1994, a year after Eritrea declared its independence and gained international recognition, a group of musicians were brought together under the direction of Kahsay Gebrehewet as part of Eritrea&#x27;s nation building efforts. The musicians, who had previously performed in various revolutionary music groups, were brought together as the national music and dance troupe, Sibrit, which means &quot;heritage&quot;. Sibrit perform music and dance from all nine of Eritrea&#x27;s main ethnic groups (Afar, Bilen, Hedareb, Saho, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Tigre and Tigrinya), they feature regularly on Eritrean radio and television shows and perform as representatives of Eritrean culture around the world. Their instrumentation includes the amplified krar, bass krar and percussion.

<text>Juan Antonio Corretjer Montes (March 3, 1908 – January 19, 1985) was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist and pro-independence political activist opposing United States rule in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==

Corretjer (birth name: Juan Antonio Corretjer Montes) was born in Ciales, Puerto Rico, into a politically active pro-independence family. His parents were Diego Corretjer Hernández and María Brígida Montes González. His father and uncles were involved in the &quot;Ciales Uprising&quot; of August 13, 1898, against the United States occupation. As a lad, he would often accompany his father and uncles to political rallies. He received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. In 1920, when he was only 12 years old, Corretjer wrote his first poem &quot;Canto a Ciales&quot; (I sing to Ciales). In 1924, Corretjer published his first booklet of poems.

Corretjer joined the &quot;Literary Society of José Gautier Benítez&quot;, which later would be renamed the &quot;Nationalist Youth&quot;, while he was still in elementary school. When he was in 8th grade, he organized a student protest against the United States in his town. He was expelled from his local high school for organizing a strike to have it renamed for José de Diego. Corretjer was then sent to school in the town of Vega Baja.

==Nationalist youth==
In 1927, he moved to San Juan and worked as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;La Democracia&quot;. He later moved to the city of Ponce where he published his first two books of poetry: &quot;Agüeybaná&quot; (1932) and &quot;Ulises&quot; (1933). Throughout his life, he wrote for various newspapers and publications in Puerto Rico, Cuba and the United States.

In 1935, Corretjer travelled to Cuba and joined an anti-Batista group whose aim was to overthrow the U.S.-backed Cuban dictator. He also traveled to Haiti and to the Dominican Republic looking for international support for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence movement.

In 1935, four Nationalists were killed by the police under the command of Colonel E. Francis Riggs. The incident became known as the Río Piedras massacre. The following year in 1936, two members of the Cadets of the Republic, the Nationalist youth organization, Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp assassinated Colonel Riggs. They were arrested and executed, without a trial, at police headquarters in San Juan.

In 1936, Corretjer met and became friends with the nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He was named Secretary General of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

On April 3, 1936, a Federal Grand Jury submitted accusations against Pedro Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Velázquez, Clemente Soto Vélez and the following members of the Cadets of the Republic: Erasmo Velázquez, Julio H. Velázquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of Title 18 of the United States Code. Title 18 of the United States Code is the criminal and penal code of the federal government of the United States. It deals with federal crimes and criminal procedure. As evidence, the prosecution referred to the creation, organization and the activities of the cadets, which the government made reference to as the &quot;Liberating Army of Puerto Rico&quot;. The government prosecutors stated that the military tactics which the cadets were taught was for the sole purpose of overthrowing the Government of the U.S. A jury composed of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans ended with a hung jury. Judge Robert A. Cooper called for a new jury, this time composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans, and a guilty verdict was reached.
Corretjer was sent to the infamous La Princesa prison for one year in 1937, because he refused to hand over to the American authorities the Book of Acts of the Nationalists Party, as result of his political beliefs.

In 1937 a group of lawyers, including a young Gilberto Concepción de Gracia, tried in vain to defend the Nationalists, but the Boston Court of Appeals, which held appellate jurisdiction over federal matters in Puerto Rico, upheld the verdict. Albizu Campos and the other Nationalist leaders were sent to the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Puerto Rico&#x27;s Gag Law==
On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948.

Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.

==Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s==
On October 30, 1950, the Nationalists staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt), and Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising).

Known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, the revolts were a widespread call for independence by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, against United States Government rule over Puerto Rico. It specifically repudiated the so-called &quot;Free Associated State&quot; (&quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot;) designation of Puerto Rico - a designation widely recognized as a colonial farce.

The revolts failed because of the overwhelming force used by the U.S. military, the Puerto Rican National Guard, the FBI, the CIA, and the Puerto Rican Insular Police - all of whom were aligned against the Nationalists. This force included the machine-gunning of Nationalists all over the island, and the aerial bombing of the town of Jayuya. Hundreds of Cadets and Nationalists, among them Corretjer, were arrested by mid-November 1950, and the party was never the same.

==Poetry and essays==

===Literary style and themes===
The themes and inspiration for his poems and essays were devoted to his defense of his native land. Corretjer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Alabanza en la Torre de Ciales&quot; (Praise in the tower of Ciales) (1953), is considered one of the representative works of the &quot;neocriollismo&quot; movement and has had a strong influence on many later poets. In Corretjer&#x27;s poetry the Taino is no longer an idealized figure but allegory of revolutionary legacy. In the prologue of &quot;Yerba bruja&quot;, Corretjer states it was not his intent to &quot;dig up a mummy&quot; but to bring to light &quot;the splendor of the indigenous imagination that lives on in our own.&quot;

His poetry spans several decades and transcended any particular literary movement. The Puerto Rican Athenaeum awarded him the honorary title of Puerto Rico National Poet.

<text>Rear Admiral Roy F. &quot;Latch&quot; Hoffmann, U.S. Navy (retired) (1925–2022) was chairman of the former Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, established May 4, 2004, in opposition to John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy for U.S. President, and which disbanded on May 31, 2008. As a naval officer, he patrolled the Mekong Delta on swift boats during the Vietnam War.

==Early life==
Hoffmann attended the University of Notre Dame. He was commissioned through the Naval ROTC program on June 1, 1946.

==Military career==

His awards included the Legion of Merit, Purple Heart, World War II Victory Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal.

==Civilian career==
Following his retirement from the Navy, he was a port director in Milwaukee, Wisconsin before being removed from the post.

Hoffmann claimed he got involved with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth after reading Douglas Brinkley&#x27;s book &quot;Tour of Duty&quot;, which, among other things, detailed Kerry&#x27;s Swift Boat duty in Vietnam; he told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t bear that someone was betraying us and being a dastardly liar. If I can be any more plain than that, I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

In 2009, the Admiral Roy F. Hoffmann Foundation ceased operations.

<text>Heeralal Mohandas Gandhi (formerly Abdullah Gandhi; born Harilal Mohandas Gandhi; 23 August 1888 – 18 June 1948) was the eldest son of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. He had three younger brothers: Manilal Gandhi, Ramdas Gandhi and Devdas Gandhi.

==Early life==
Harilal was born on 23 August 1888, just before his father left for England for higher studies. Harilal remained in India with his mother.

Harilal was involved in the Indian independence movement, and was imprisoned as a satyagrahi six times between 1908 and 1911. His willingness to endure these sentences earned him the nickname of &#x27;Chhote (Little) Gandhi&#x27;.

He too wanted to go to England for higher studies, hoping to become a barrister as his father had once been. His father however firmly opposed this, believing that a Western-style education would not be helpful in the struggle against British rule over India, leading to tensions between father and son. Eventually rebelling against his father&#x27;s decision, in 1911 Harilal renounced all family ties.

In 1906 he married Gulab Gandhi, with whom he had had five children: two daughters, Rami, and Manu; and three sons, Kantilal, Rasiklal and Shantilal. Rasiklal and Shantilal died at an early age. He had four grandchildren (Anushrya, Prabodh, Neelam Solanki, and Navmalika) via Rani, two (Shanti and Pradeep) via Kantilal, and one (Urmi) via Manu. After Gulab died during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Harilal became detached from his children. He contemplated marrying his wife&#x27;s sister Kumi Adalaja, who was a child widow, however this did not materialize. This led to Harilal&#x27;s further descent and he gradually began to slip and became an alcoholic. 

In 1925, Harilal had lent Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s name to a Calcutta firm &quot;All India Stores.&quot; One of the investor of this firm was a Muslim from Lyallpur, he feared this was a bogus fair. He sent a legal notice to Young India, whose editor was Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi replied that &#x27;Harilal was indeed his son but his ideals and mine are different and he has been living separately since 1915&#x27;.

He stayed in touch with his father sporadically through the years, sometimes through commonly known people, right up to 1947.

Harilal appeared at his father&#x27;s funeral in such a poor health condition that few recognized him.

Neelam Parikh, the daughter of Ranibehn, the eldest of Harilal&#x27;s children, wrote a biography of him subsequently, entitled &quot;Gandhiji&#x27;s Lost Jewel: Harilal Gandhi&quot;.

==Religious conversions==

In May 1936, at the age of 48, Harilal publicly converted to Islam and named himself Abdullah Gandhi. Later on he re-converted to Hinduism.

==Letters from Mahatma Gandhi==

In June 1935, Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter
 to Harilal, accusing him of &quot;alcohol and debauchery&quot;. In the letters, Mahatma Gandhi stated that Harilal&#x27;s problems were more difficult for him to deal with than the struggle for an independent India. In these letters, Gandhi also accused Harilal of raping his own daughter.

In 2014 three letters written by Mahatma Gandhi to Harilal in 1935 were offered for auction.

==Death==

Harilal died of tuberculosis four months after Gandhi&#x27;s death, on the night of 18 June 1948, aged 59 at a municipal hospital (now the Sewri TB Hospital) in Mumbai. His death certificate is preserved at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation&#x27;s archives in Vakola. Harilal&#x27;s death certificate reveals that he was admitted to the hospital after being found unconscious in Kamathipura. Harilal did not reveal to staff that he was Gandhi&#x27;s son, and his family only found out about his hospitalisation after his death.

==&quot;Gandhi, My Father&quot;==
The troubled relationship between Harilal and his father is the subject of the film and play &quot;Gandhi, My Father&quot;. The film adaptation was released on 3 August 2007 and directed by Feroz Abbas Khan and produced by Anil Kapoor. Harilal is portrayed by Akshaye Khanna. Khan&#x27;s play, &quot;Mahatma vs. Gandhi&quot;, while different from this film, had a similar theme. The film got positive reviews from critics but was a failure at box office. 

There is also a Marathi play named &quot;Gandhi virudh Gandhi&quot;.

<doc id="990130" wikidata="Q6942148" url="?curid=990130" title="Music of Liberia">
<text>The music of Liberia uses many tribal beats and often one of the native dialects, or vernacular. Liberian music includes traditional Gbema music, as well as the popular genre Hipco.

==Gbema music or traditional music==
Liberian music makes particular use of vocal harmony, repetition and call-and-response song structure as well as such typical West African elements as ululation and the polyrhythm typical of rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa. Christian music was introduced to Liberia by American missionaries and Christian songs are now sung in a style that mixes American harmonies with West African language, rhythm and the call-and-response format.
Traditional music is performed at weddings, naming ceremonies, royal events and other special occasions, as well as ordinary children&#x27;s songs, work songs and lullabies.

==Popular music==
Highlife, and Hiplife music are very popular in Liberia, as elsewhere in West Africa. Both Highlife and Hiplife music evolved out of Africa&#x27;s original sound called Palmwine Music or Gbema music genre. All African music legends since 1920s were greatly inspired by the Palmwine music which originated out of Liberia in 1918-1920 by indigenous kru tribe of the Grain Coast of Africa. Late in the 1950s, a combination of North American, West African and Latin American styles, emerged in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Liberia, especially among the Liberian Kru people, who were sailors that learned to played Funk, Jazz, and Fuji from Americo Liberians who settled on the African continent from Louisiana, USA during the abolition of Slavery between 1822-1846. The Kru people played Spanish guitar, banjo, pennywhistle, harmonica, accordion, mandolin and concertina and their sounds inspired the rest of African music since then. The Palm wine music also known as Gbema music genre also inspired the evolution of HipCo music in Liberia. 

Past and present musicians include Fatu Gayflor and Miatta Fahnbulleh.

The country&#x27;s most renowned radio station is ELBC, or the Liberian Broadcasting System. Rap and pop music are also performed in indigenous languages across the country.

In 1963, President Tubman set up the new Cape-Palmas Military Band (CPMB). Israeli bandmaster Aharon Shefi formed and conducted a 56-piece concert and marching band that performed Liberian, American and universal folk and church music. The CPMB has performed on January 1, 1964, at President Tubman&#x27;s inauguration in Monrovia. Among the pieces played were Highlife, original marches by the late Liberian composer Victor Bowya, the National Anthem and &quot;The Lone Star Forever&quot;. The CPMB had also performed in churches, schools, holidays and military parades and official events.

==Hipco==

Liberia has a unique Liberian rap and singing genre called Hipco, or &quot;Co&quot;. The &quot;co&quot; in the genre is short for the Liberian dialect Kolokwa. Hipco is usually performed in Liberian English or the local vernacular. Kolokwa rap in Gbema music evolved in the 1980s but was not branded as HipCo music genre until 2002-2003 when HipCo was founded or established by the Liberian Legendary Detrench, the late DJ SummerTime and MC Switch. HipCo has always had a social and political bent. In the 1990s it continued to develop through the civil wars. Hipco music was becoming popular in 2004 and still is the most popular music genre of Liberia, &quot;serving as the medium through which rappers and singers speak against societal ills, including injustice and corruption and also with an infusion of enticing lyrics for pleasure.&quot; UNICEF has worked with Hipco artists to release Hipco songs on Ebola prevention, with several of the songs becoming popular on radio in the country in 2014. Among high-profile Hipco artists are Takun J, DenG, and MC Caro.

<text>Various kinds of Arab music are popular in Libya such as Andalusi music, locally known as Ma&#x27;luf, Chabi and Arab classical music.

The Tuareg in the south have their own distinctive folk music. There is little or no pop music industry. Among the Tuareg, women are the musicians. They play a one-stringed violin called an anzad, as well as a variety of drums.

Two of the most famous musicians of Libya are Ahmed Fakroun and Mohamed Hassan.

Among Libyan Arabs, instruments include the zokra (a bagpipe), flute (made of bamboo), tambourine, oud (a fretless lute) and darbuka, a goblet drum held sideways and played with the fingers. Intricate clapping is also common in Libyan folk music.

Traveling Bedouin poet-singers have spread many popular songs across Libya. Among their styles is huda, the camel driver&#x27;s song, the rhythm of which is said to mimic the feet of a walking camel.

During the 2011 revolution, the Berber singer Dania Ben Sassi went viral with her songs praising the sacrifices of the Libyan people, sung in Amazight.

<text>&quot;O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing&quot; is a Christian hymn written by Charles Wesley. The hymn was placed first in John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Hymns for the People Called Methodists&quot; published in 1780. It was the first hymn in every (Wesleyan) Methodist hymnal from that time until the publication of &quot;Hymns and Psalms&quot; in 1983.

==Background==
Charles Wesley was suffering a bout of pleurisy in May 1738, while he and his brother were studying under the Moravian scholar Peter Boehler in London. At the time, Wesley was plagued by extreme doubts about his faith. Taken to bed with the sickness, on 21 May Wesley was attended by a group of Christians who offered him testimony and basic care, and he was deeply affected by this. He read from his Bible and found himself deeply affected by the words, and at peace with God. Shortly his strength began to return. He wrote of this experience in his journal, and counted it as a renewal of his faith; when his brother John had a similar experience on 24 May, the two men met and sang a hymn Charles had written in praise of his renewal.

One year from the experience, Wesley was taken with the urge to write another hymn, this one in commemoration of his renewal of faith. This hymn took the form of an 18-stanza poem, beginning with the opening lines &quot;Glory to God, and praise, and love, / Be ever, ever given&quot; and was published in 1740 and entitled &quot;For the anniversary day of one&#x27;s conversion&quot;. The seventh verse, which begins, &quot;O for a thousand tongues to sing&quot;, and which now is invariably the first verse of a shorter hymn, recalls Boehler&#x27;s words, &quot;Had I a thousand tongues I would praise him [God] with them all&quot;.

==Original text==
The original text is as follows:

1. Glory to God, and praise and love,&lt;br&gt;
Be ever, ever given;&lt;br&gt;
By saints below and saints above,&lt;br&gt;
The Church in earth and heaven.

2. On this glad day the glorious Sun&lt;br&gt;
Of righteousness arose,&lt;br&gt;
On my benighted soul he shone,&lt;br&gt;
And filled it with repose.

3. Sudden expired the legal strife;&lt;br&gt;
&#x27;Twas then I ceased to grieve.&lt;br&gt;
My second, real, living life,&lt;br&gt;
I then began to live.

4. Then with my heart I first believed,&lt;br&gt;
Believed with faith divine;&lt;br&gt;
Power with the Holy Ghost received&lt;br&gt;
To call the Saviour mine.

5. I felt my Lord&#x27;s atoning blood&lt;br&gt;
Close to my soul applied;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Me, me&quot; he loved - the Son of God&lt;br&gt;
For &quot;me,&quot; for &quot;me&quot; he died!

6. I found and owned his promise true,&lt;br&gt;
Ascertained of my part,&lt;br&gt;
My pardon passed in heaven I know,&lt;br&gt;
When written on my heart.

7. O For a thousand tongues to sing &lt;br&gt;
My dear Redeemer&#x27;s praise! &lt;br&gt;
The glories of my God and King, &lt;br&gt;
The triumphs of His grace!

8. My gracious Master and my God, &lt;br&gt;
Assist me to proclaim, &lt;br&gt;
To spread through all the world abroad&lt;br&gt;
The honors of Thy name.

9. Jesus! the Name that charms our fears, &lt;br&gt;
That bids our sorrows cease; &lt;br&gt;
&#x27;Tis music in the sinner&#x27;s ears, &lt;br&gt;
&#x27;Tis life, and health, and peace.

10. He breaks the power of cancell&#x27;d sin, &lt;br&gt;
He sets the prisoner free; &lt;br&gt;
His blood can make the foulest clean, &lt;br&gt;
His blood avail&#x27;d for &quot;me&quot;.

11. He speaks, - and, listening to his voice, &lt;br&gt;
New life the dead receive; &lt;br&gt;
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice; &lt;br&gt;
The humble poor believe.

12. Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb, &lt;br&gt;
Your loosen&#x27;d tongues employ; &lt;br&gt;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come, &lt;br&gt;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

13. Look unto him, ye nations; own&lt;br&gt;
Your God, ye fallen race; &lt;br&gt;
Look, and be saved through faith alone, &lt;br&gt;
Be justified by grace.

14. See all your sins on Jesus laid; &lt;br&gt;
The Lamb of God was slain; &lt;br&gt;
His soul was once an offering made&lt;br&gt;
For every soul of man.

15. Harlots, and publicans, and thieves,&lt;br&gt;
In holy triumph join!&lt;br&gt;
Saved is the sinner that believes,&lt;br&gt;
From crimes as great as mine.

16. Murderers, and all ye hellish crew,&lt;br&gt;
Ye sons of lust and pride,&lt;br&gt;
Believe the Savior died for you;&lt;br&gt;
For me the Saviour died.

17. Awake from guilty nature&#x27;s sleep, &lt;br&gt;
And Christ shall give you light, &lt;br&gt;
Cast all your sins into the deep, &lt;br&gt;
And wash the AEthiop white.

18. With me, your chief, ye then shall know, &lt;br&gt;
Shall feel your sins forgiven; &lt;br&gt;
Anticipate your heaven below, &lt;br&gt;
And own that love is heaven.

==Current versions==
Today the hymn is often condensed into a smaller number of stanzas, typically between six and eight.

The 1989 editors of &quot;The United Methodist Hymnal&quot; omitted the verse containing the words &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;lame&quot;, but later reverted to the original version.

The authors of &quot;Companion to Hymns and Psalms&quot; (1988) note that the verse &quot;He breaks the power of cancelled sin&quot; is an apparent tautology, but speculated on Wesley&#x27;s intention.

==Tunes==

In the U.S., the hymn is commonly sung to Lowell Mason&#x27;s 1839 arrangement of the hymn tune &quot;Azmon&quot;, written by Carl G. Glaser in 1828. Mason&#x27;s arrangement was written as a setting for this hymn. In Great Britain, Thomas Jarman&#x27;s tune &quot;Lyngham&quot; is favoured, especially in larger congregations, although the tunes &quot;Lydia&quot; by Thomas Phillips and &quot;Richmond&quot; by Thomas Haweis are also used. &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; has A. J. Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Selby&quot; and J. H. Coombes&#x27;s &quot;Oxford New&quot;. In Australia, &quot;Lyngham&quot; is the favoured tune in churches, although &quot;Azmon&quot; and &quot;Lydia&quot; are also widely used.

<doc id="990165" wikidata="Q483997" url="?curid=990165" title="Governor-General of Chōsen">
<text>The Governor-General of Chōsen (; ) was the chief administrator of the : a part of an administrative organ established by the Imperial government of Japan. The position existed from 1910 to 1945.

The governor-general of Chōsen was established shortly after the Korean Empire was formally annexed by the Empire of Japan in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 to replace the title of Resident-General. The governor-general of Chōsen was appointed from Tokyo and accountable to the emperor of Japan. The governor-general of Chōsen was responsible for the administrate ministry of the Chōsen regionin, including infrastructure, culture, justice, censorship, and the suppression of the Korean independence movement.

The governor-general of Chōsen was seated in the General Government Building in Keijō after its completion in 1926. Pending its completion, the governor-general resided at Namsan.

== History ==

After the annexation of Korea to Japan in 1910, the office of resident-general was replaced by that of governor-general. However, the position was unique in among Japan&#x27;s external possessions, as the governor-general had sweeping plenipotentiary powers, and the position also entailed judicial oversight and some legislative powers. As of 1944, the governor-general did not command the Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy units stationed in Chōsen. Given the powers and levels of responsibility, only ranking full generals in the Imperial Japanese Army were selected for the post, with the sole exception of Viscount Saitō, a retired admiral.

The governor-general of Chōsen had a police organisation, which may have been partly involved in having Korean women working as comfort women.

After the Japanese defeat in World War II, the Korean Peninsula was administered by the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. The governor-general building was demolished during administration of South Korean president Kim Young-sam on August 15, 1995.

=== Prime Ministers of Japan ===
Four individuals who held the position of the governor-general of Chōsen also held the office of the prime minister of Japan. Three, Terauchi Masatake, Saitō Makoto, and Koiso Kuniaki, were governors-general before becoming prime ministers. One, Abe Nobuyuki, was prime minister before his appointment as governor-general. Ugaki Kazushige was named prime minister-designate, but he could not take office because he was unable to form a cabinet.

In addition, Resident-General Itō Hirobumi served four terms as prime minister prior to his appointment to Korea.

<text>The Music of Luxembourg is an important component of the country&#x27;s cultural life. The new Philharmonie concert hall provides a venue for orchestral concerts while opera is frequently presented in the theatres. Rock, pop and jazz are also popular with a number of successful performers. The wide general interest in music and musical activities in Luxembourg can be seen from the membership of the Union Grand-Duc Adolphe, the national music federation for choral societies, brass bands, music schools, theatrical societies, folklore associations and instrumental groups. Some 340 music groups and associations with over 17,000 individual members are currently represented by the organization.

==History==

Music in what is now the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has a history stretching back to the Gallo-Roman period. The 3rd-century Roman mosaic from Vichten presents excellent representations of the muses Euterpe with her flutes and Erato playing the lyre, testifying to an early interest in music. The 6th-century Latin poet Venantius Fortunatus tells us he was impressed by the music he heard in the region. From the 8th century, the Abbey of Echternach became an important centre for church music. Around the year 900, the abbey produced the &quot;Officium Sancti Willibrordi&quot; manuscript, one of the first examples of musical notation from Luxembourg.

After the Grand Duchy was established in 1815, interest in music slowly developed across the country, initially with patriotic music played by military bands. In 1842, the Luxembourg Army Band known as the &quot;Musique militaries grand-ducale&quot; was found in Echternach with some 24 musicians from the battalion stationed there. In 1852, the &quot;Société philharmonique&quot; was founded in Ettelbrück by the local priest J. B. Victor Müllendorf with the objective of &quot;supporting all types of vocal and instrumental music&quot;. On the occasion of the first train from Luxembourg to Thionville on 4 October 1859, the national poet Michel Lentz wrote the words and music for &quot;De Feierwon&quot;, a patriotic song with the famous line &quot;Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin&quot; (We want to remain as we are).

In the middle of the 19th century, music and singing societies became increasingly popular. A series of local composers wrote vocal music and light pieces to be performed by the brass bands and choirs which were also emerging everywhere. They included Joseph-Alexandre Müller, Louis Beicht and Emile Boeres as well as Gustave Kahnt and Pol Albrecht who, apart from being prolific composers, were bandmasters for the Luxembourg Band.

==Overview==

Luxembourg&#x27;s music and cultural heritage is Germanic. The national music federation is the Union Grand-Duc Adolphe (UGDA); another important institution is the Luxembourg Conservatory of Music with some 2,600 students each year. Annual music festivals include the Echternach Music Festival and the Rock um Knuedler in Luxembourg City. The national radio station, Radio Luxembourg, is listened to throughout Europe. Modern Luxembourg is home to an array of performers with the rise of folk, classical, popular music (pop, rock, hip hop) and electronic dance music (hardstyle, jumpstyle).

The national anthem is &quot;Ons Heemecht&quot; (&quot;Our Homeland&quot;), which was composed and written by Jean-Antoine Zinnen and Michel Lentz. It has been the national anthem since 1895.

===Classical music===

One of the most influential and versatile musicians in Luxembourg was Laurent Menager (1835–1902). Often referred to as Luxembourg&#x27;s national composer, he was also an enthusiastic choirmaster, organist and teacher. In 1857, he founded the national choral association &quot;Sang a Klang&quot;. His many compositions include choral works, church music, orchestral pieces and operettas as well as music for brass bands and the theatre.

The Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra, originally known as the RTL Grand Symphony Orchestra, was founded in 1933. Since 2005, when the Philharmonie Luxembourg concert hall was opened, the orchestra has had its own home. Recent directors have done much to enhance its image, particularly in regard to 20th-century French music. Opera is frequently performed in Luxembourg City at the Grand Théâtre and in Esch-sur-Alzette at the Théâtre d’Esch as well as at the annual Wiltz festival.

Luxembourg&#x27;s internationally recognized soloists include violinist Sandrine Cantoreggi, cellist Françoise Groben, pianists Francesco Tristano Schlimé and Jean Muller, and singer Mariette Kemmer. Among its contemporary composers are Camille Kerger, Claude Lenners, Georges Lentz (although he lives mainly in Australia), Alexander Mullenbach and Marcel Wengler. Since 1999, the Luxembourg Sinfonietta orchestra has done much to promote contemporary music, not only by performing Luxembourg works at home and abroad but by organizing annual international competitions for contemporary composers.

The Luxembourg-based ensemble The Art of Music was founded in 1993. With approximately seven members, it specialises in singing Renaissance religious music, with some medieval repertoire as well. As of 2018, it had published 11 CDs.

===Jazz===

Jazz is in Luxembourg with artists such as trumpeters Ernie Hammes and Gast Waltzing, pianist Michel Reis and percussionist Pascal Schumacher. Waltzing has gained a name as a composer of film and TV music while Schumacher has performed worldwide with his Pascal Schumacher Quartet.

=== Folk, rock, pop ===

Serge Tonnar &amp; Legotrip sing in Luxembourgish mainly about small and bigger idiosyncrasies of Luxembourg life and politics. Some albums: &quot;Klasseklon, Legotrip, Pärele bei d&#x27;sei&quot;, and a single: &quot;Wat der Noper seet&quot;.

Kate, a five-member indy-folk-pop group (started in 2008, first album in 2010, titled &quot;Can&#x27;t keep Secrets&quot;), brought out its second album &quot;Life in Stereo&quot; in 2012 with a new pianist, Tom.

Luxembourg was a founding participant of the Eurovision Song Contest, and participated every year between 1956 and 1993, with the exception of 1959, but will return to the contest in 2024. It won the competition a total of five times, 1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983 and hosted the contest in 1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984. The Grand Duchy&#x27;s last entry was in 1993. Luxembourg&#x27;s most famous entry is perhaps Poupée de cire, poupée de son, penned by French composer Serge Gainsbourg and performed by the French artist France Gall. Only eight of its 38 entries were performed by Luxembourgish artists. Three of the entries were performed in Luxembourgish: &quot;So laang we&#x27;s du do bast&quot; by Camillo Felgen in 1960, &quot;Sou fräi&quot; by Marion Welter and Kontinent in 1992, and &quot;Donne-moi une chance&quot; by Modern Times in 1993.

There is a small but active metal music scene, with a handful of bands known to have played various European Metal festivals. Notable is the band Pronoian Made, the first to play gothic influenced metal in the country.

Though formed in London and being labeled a British band, Placebo have close ties to Luxembourg, as two members attended the American School of Luxembourg (now International School of Luxembourg).

=== Hip Hop ===
In 2002, hip hop group The Gentles (formerly known as: Gentle MC&#x27;s) was formed in Petange and they performed lyrics in Luxembourgish, German, French and English. In 2003, they released their debut single &quot;Firwat&quot; as a campaign against drunk driving in Luxembourg and reached the local radio charts. The song was also recorded in English, titled &quot;Why&quot;, and released in 2004.
The group&#x27;s album &quot;Gentle Attitude&quot; was released in 2005, additional with two singles &quot;Empfäng der deen Toun?&quot; and the French title &quot;L&#x27;abandon de nos familles&quot;.

On 10 October 2018 rapper Turnup Tun (real name: Tun Tonnar) - son of musician Serge Tonnar - released his song &quot;FCK LXB&quot;, a political statement against right-wing politics in Luxembourg (see Politics of Luxembourg). The song sparked controversy national and the rapper had to face court in March 2019, following complains by right-wing politicians. In the song, Turnup Tun takes aim at several politicians, including Fred Keup, Joe Thein and Tom Weidig, a candidate for the &quot;ADR&quot; (Alternative Democratic Reformparty) in the 2018 election in Luxembourg who later became a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He also named Daniel Schmitz, an online personality known for his xenophobic statements. Keup, Thein and Schmitz pressed charges for slander and feeling personally offended by the song&#x27;s lyrics, which goes: &quot;Féck de Fred Keup (...) Féck de Joe Thein (...) Féck den Dan Schmitz&quot; (translated: &quot;Fuck Fred Keup (...) Fuck Joe Thein (...) Fuck Dan Schmitz&quot;).

<doc id="990183" wikidata="Q305718" url="?curid=990183" title="Abaya">
<text>The abaya (colloquially and more commonly, &#x27;, especially in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]:&#x27;; plural &#x27;,&#x27;), sometimes also called an aba, is a simple, loose over-garment, essentially a robe-like dress, worn by some women in the Muslim world including most of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. Traditional abayas are usually black and may either be a large square of fabric draped from the shoulders or head or a long kaftan. The &quot;abaya&quot; covers the whole body except the head (sometimes), feet, and hands. It can be worn with the &quot;niqāb&quot;, a face veil covering all but the eyes. Some women also wear long black gloves, so their hands are covered as well. It is common that the abaya be worn on special occasions, such as mosque visits, Islamic holiday celebrations for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and also during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.

==Rationale==
The rationale for the abaya is often attributed to the Quranic quote, &quot;O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, to cover themselves with a loose garment. They will thus be recognised and no harm will come to them&quot; (Qur&#x27;an 33:59, translated by Ahmed Ali). This quotation is often given as the argument for wearing the abaya.

==Countries==
Outside some states such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen, UAE, Qatar and Pakistan the abaya is not widely worn by Muslim women. Abaya also refers to different garments in different countries. In Arab states of the Persian Gulf, they tend to be black in color.

===Saudi Arabia===
In Saudi Arabia, women were required to cover in public. However, in March 2018, the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman claimed that women could choose what to wear in public, provided it met certain standards, when he stated, &quot;The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear&quot;.

====Foreign servicewomen in Saudi Arabia====
American military pilot Martha McSally was represented by The Rutherford Institute in &quot;McSally v. Rumsfeld&quot;, a successful 2001 lawsuit against the United States Department of Defense, challenging the military policy that required U.S. and U.K. servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear the abaya when traveling off base in the country.

In 2002, General Tommy Franks, then commander of the United States Central Command, announced that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be &quot;encouraged&quot; to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally&#x27;s lawsuit but had already been &quot;under review&quot; before the lawsuit was filed. McSally had been working to change the policy for several years and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply.

Also in 2002, the U.S. Congress passed legislation prohibiting anyone in the military from &quot;requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers&#x27; money to buy them.&quot;

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Abayas are commonly worn in the United Arab Emirates. They often are made with fabrics such as crêpe, georgette, and chiffon and light colors like beige and white that are suited to the country’s climate.

=== Indonesia ===
The abaya in Indonesia takes on a unique style called the &quot;jilbab.&quot; It is paired with a headscarf and is often brightly colored or patterned, reflecting the vibrant Indonesian culture.

Abayas are known by various names but serve the same purpose, which is to cover. Contemporary models are usually caftans, cut from light, flowing fabrics like crepe, georgette, and chiffon. Other known styles are front open and front closed abaya. Styles differ from region to region: some abayas have embroidery on black fabric while others are brightly colored and have different forms of artwork across them.

== Abaya ban in French schools ==
In August 2023, French education minister Gabriel Attal said that abayas would be banned in state schools as they breached the &quot;principle of secularism&quot;. On 4 September, the first day of the new academic year, French schools sent 67 girls home for refusing to remove their abayas.

== Influence of Western fashion in abaya designs ==
In the mid-20th century, the influence of Western fashion began to permeate the Arab world. This led to a significant transformation in abaya design. While the basic silhouette remained the same, new fabrics like silk, chiffon, and lace were introduced. Designers began experimenting with colors, patterns, cuts, and styles, blending traditional elements with contemporary fashion trends.

<doc id="990184" wikidata="Q753741" url="?curid=990184" title="Pin-tailed sandgrouse">
<text>The pin-tailed sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata) is a medium large bird in the sandgrouse family. It has a small, pigeon-like head and neck and a sturdy, compact body. It has long pointed wings, which are white underneath, a long tail and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn. The call is a loud &quot;kattar-kattar&quot;. This gregarious species breeds on dry open treeless plains and similar habitats. Its nest is a ground scrape into which two or three cream-coloured eggs with cryptic markings are laid. Both sexes incubate the eggs.

The pin-tailed sandgrouse is about long. Its head and upperparts are yellowish-green. The underparts are white with a chestnut breast band separating the belly from the green neck. Sexes are somewhat similar, but the female is better camouflaged and has a shorter tail than the male. There are two subspecies; &quot;P. a. alchata&quot; breeds in southern Europe and &quot;P. a. caudacutus&quot; breeds in northwestern Africa, the Middle East and southeastern Asia. It is a partial migrant, with some Asian birds moving to the Middle East and northern Pakistan in winter. Males of the eastern race have duller underparts than the European birds, and the females have white, rather than yellow, wing coverts.

==Taxonomy==
There are two subspecies. The nominate race, &quot;P. a. alchata&quot;, breeds in Iberia and southern France, and the eastern form &quot;P. a. caudacutus&quot; (Gmelin, 1774) is found in northwest Africa, and from southeast Turkey east to Kazakhstan.

The species name &quot;alchata&quot; is thought to be derived from the Arabic name &quot;al-gata القطا&quot; which is derived from the call of the bird.

==Description==
The pin-tailed sandgrouse is a robust, medium-sized bird about in length. The general colouring is cryptic, a blend of barred and flecked olive green, brown, buff, yellow, grey and black. The underparts and the feathered legs are dull white.
The sexes are different and the male&#x27;s plumage varies with the time of year. In the breeding season, the male has the crown, most of the neck, the back and under-wing coverts a yellowish-green colour with dull yellow spots in the shoulder region. The cheeks are also yellow with a narrow black line extending from the beak, through the eye to the nape of the neck. The irises are brown and the beak is slatey grey. There is a black patch on the throat immediately below the beak and below this, there is a broad, reddish-brown band round the breast, bordered by a thin black stripe above and below the band. The outer wing coverts are chestnut edged with black and white and the primaries are black with pale edges which gives both the leading and trailing edges of the wing the appearance of a black rim in flight. The rump and the tail are distinctly barred in black and brownish-yellow and the streamers on the central tail feathers are slate-grey. Outside the breeding season, all the upper parts, including the crown and cheeks, are barred in black and brownish-yellow and the throat loses its black patch, becoming whitish.

The female is generally similar to the male but the colours are duller. The cheeks and neck are golden-buff and lack the greenish tinge of the male. There is a black stripe running through the eye. The chin is white and there is an additional yellow-buff band across the breast with a broad black stripe above, another thinner one about a third of the way down and a further narrow black stripe at the base. The back and wings are grey, barred with black. The rump and the tail (which has shorter central feathers than the male) are similar in colouration to the male but have finer black barrings.

In flight, the pin-tailed sandgrouse can be identified by its bright, white underparts and under-wing coverts, and the long feathers in the centre part of its tail. It is usually silent when on the ground but in the air communicates with other birds with a frequently uttered, loud &quot;kattar-kattar&quot;, a nasal &quot;ga-ga-ga&quot; and a low-pitched &quot;gang gang&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pin-tailed sandgrouse breeds in North Africa and the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Kazakhstan. In Europe it breeds in Spain, Portugal and the southern part of France. Eastern populations, particularly those from Kazakhstan, migrate to Pakistan and parts of northern India in winter.

The pin-tailed sandgrouse inhabits open areas of stony land, semi arid areas at the edge of deserts, treeless plains and occasionally dried-out mud flats. In winter it may visit ploughed or fallow land but prefers sandy soils and is much less reliant on vegetation cover than the black-bellied sandgrouse (&quot;Pterocles orientalis&quot;) which has a similar range. It does not occur at elevations above about .

==Behaviour==
The pin-tailed sandgrouse often feeds in groups and gathers regularly in large numbers at waterholes, to which the birds fly soon after dawn. During the day they disperse to forage for seeds, which are the main part of their diet, and also eat buds, green shoots and leaves. They favour leguminous seeds and also eat seeds of knotweed (&quot;Polygonum&quot;), buckwheat (&quot;Fagopyrum&quot;), &quot;Salicornia&quot;, &quot;Artemisia&quot;, camelthorn (&quot;Alhagi&quot;), rock rose (&quot;Helianthemum&quot;) and asphodel (&quot;Asphodelus&quot;). In cultivated areas they take grain and the seeds of leguminous crops. Beetles and other small invertebrates are sometimes eaten and grit is consumed to help grind up the contents of the crop.

==Breeding==

The pin-tailed sandgrouse nests in a slight depression on the ground in the open. Two or three eggs are laid at intervals of two days, creamy-brown spotted with darker brown, reddish-brown and grey. Both parents share the task of incubation which lasts from nineteen to twenty five days. The male starts his shift about an hour before sunset and the female takes over after she has been to the waterhole in the morning. The young are precocial and leave the nest soon after they have hatched. Both parents care for them but only the male is involved in bringing them water, absorbed by the feathers on his breast. The chicks are able to feed themselves by the age of a week and can fly by the time they are four weeks old. They are dependent on their parents for two months and attain their adult plumage at about four months. There is normally a single brood each year but if the eggs are destroyed or removed, more eggs may be laid.

==Status==
The pin-tailed sandgrouse is rated as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot; by BirdLife International. This is because it has a large range and the population, estimated to be somewhere between 130,000 and 1,500,000 individuals, is believed to be stable. The range may be expanding in south eastern Turkey, possibly as a result of changes in climate. However, the populations in parts of Europe are decreasing due to changes in agricultural production. The bird remains common in Spain but in the only remaining locality in southern France where it is found, at La Crau, only about 170 pairs remained in 2002, while there were fewer than 100 pairs of birds breeding in Portugal in the same year.

<text>The French Academy in Rome (, ) is an academy located in the Villa Medici, within the Villa Borghese, on the Pincio (Pincian Hill) in Rome, Italy.

==History==
The Academy was founded at the Palazzo Capranica in 1666 by Louis XIV under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Charles Le Brun and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The Academy was from the 17th to 19th centuries the culmination of study for select French artists who, having won the prestigious Prix de Rome (Rome Prize), were honored with a 3, 4 or 5-year scholarship (depending on the art discipline they followed) in the Eternal City for the purpose of the study of art and architecture. Such scholars were and are known as &quot;pensionnaires de l&#x27;Académie&quot; (Academy pensioners). One recipient of the scholarship in the 17th century was Pierre Le Gros the Younger.

The Academy was housed in the Palazzo Capranica until 1737, and then in the Palazzo Mancini from 1737 to 1793. The Scottish artists Alexander Clerk, Allan Ramsay and Alexander Cunyngham enrolled as day students at the Academy during this period. In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte moved it to the Villa Medici, with the intention of perpetuating an institution once threatened by the French Revolution and, thus, of retaining for young French artists the opportunity to see and copy the masterpieces of the Antiquity or the Renaissance and send back to Paris their &quot;envois de Rome&quot;, the results of the inspiration they had gained in Rome. These &quot;envois&quot; were annual works, sent to Paris to be judged, and were a compulsory requirement for all the pensionaries.

At first, the villa and its gardens were in a sad state and had to be renovated to house the winners of the Prix de Rome. The competition was interrupted during the first World War, and Mussolini confiscated the villa in 1941, forcing the academy of France in Rome to withdraw to Nice then to Fontainebleau until 1945. The competition and Prix de Rome were eliminated in 1968 by André Malraux (the last Grand Prix for architecture came to an end as early as 1967, the events of 1968 preventing its continuation). The Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and the Institut de France then lost their guardianship of the Villa Medici to the Ministry of the Culture and the State. From that time on, the boarders no longer belonged solely to the traditional disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, medal-engraving, precious-stone engraving, musical composition) but also to new or previously neglected artistic fields (art history, archaeology, literature, stagecraft, photography, movies, video, restoration, writing and even cookery). These artists-in-residence are known as &quot;pensionnaires.&quot; The French word ‘pension’ refers to the room and board these generally young and promising artists receive. The artists are no longer recruited by a competition but by application, and their stays vary from six to eighteen months and even, more rarely, two years.

Between 1961 and 1967, the artist Balthus, then at the head of the Academy, carried out a vast restoration campaign of the palace and its gardens, providing them with modern equipment. Balthus participated &quot;hands on&quot; in all the phases of the construction. Where the historic décor had disappeared, Balthus proposed personal alternatives. He invented a décor that was a homage to the past and, at the same time, radically contemporary: The mysterious melancholic decor he created for Villa Medici has become, in turn, historic and was undergoing an important restoration campaign in 2016. Work continued under the direction of director, Richard Peduzzi, and the Villa Medici resumed organizing exhibitions and shows created by its artists in residence.

Under director Frédéric Mitterrand the Academy opened up its guest rooms to the general public at times when they are not used by pensionnaires or other official guests.

<text>Oyster crackers are small, salted crackers, typically rounds about in diameter, although a slightly smaller hexagonal variety is also common. Oyster crackers are often served with oyster stew and clam chowder and have a flavor similar to saltine crackers.

== In cuisine==
Oyster crackers are popular in the northeastern United States, where they are served as an accompaniment to soup, and in the Cincinnati area, where they are frequently served with that city&#x27;s distinctive chili. In New England, oyster crackers are served with oyster stew and chowders. Plain oyster crackers are sometimes seasoned with various spices or pepper sauce and served as an appetizer or snack. Oyster crackers have a taste similar to saltine crackers, but usually are less salty. In other areas of the United States, they are among the choices for crackers with soup or salads and are often available in restaurants in single serving packages.

Many different companies produce oyster crackers with different combinations of shortenings and other ingredients, but retaining the same general shape and size.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term &quot;oyster cracker&quot; is unclear, but it may be that they were originally served with oyster stew or clam chowder or possibly that they look somewhat like an oyster in its shell. Other names include &quot;water cracker,&quot; &quot;Philadelphia cracker,&quot; and &quot;Trenton cracker&quot;.

== Origins ==

The Westminster Cracker Company, currently of Rutland, Vermont, claims to have been making oyster crackers since 1828. However, a counterclaim credits Adam Exton with inventing the oyster cracker nearly 18 years later.

Adam Exton, a baker in Trenton, New Jersey, immigrated to America from Lancashire, England, in 1842. In Trenton, Exton opened a cake and cracker bakery with his brother-in-law, Richard Aspden, in 1846. Although Aspden died the following year, Exton continued with the bakery (the &quot;Exton Cracker Bakery&quot; or &quot;Adam Exton &amp; Co.&quot;). He invented a machine that rolled and docked pastry and solved the sanitary problems of hand-rolling crackers.

The history of the oyster cracker was related by Exton&#x27;s nephew, also named Adam Exton, in the &quot;Trenton Evening Times&quot; newspaper on May 31, 1917:

<text>In chemistry, a concerted reaction is a chemical reaction in which all bond breaking and bond making occurs in a single step. Reactive intermediates or other unstable high energy intermediates are not involved. Concerted reaction rates tend not to depend on solvent polarity ruling out large buildup of charge in the transition state. The reaction is said to progress through a concerted mechanism as all bonds are formed and broken &quot;in concert&quot;. Pericyclic reactions, the S2 reaction, and some rearrangements - such as the Claisen rearrangement - are concerted reactions.

The rate of the SN2 reaction is second order overall due to the reaction being bimolecular (i.e. there are two molecular species involved in the rate-determining step). The reaction does not have any intermediate steps, only a transition state. This means that all the bond making and bond breaking takes place in a single step. In order for the reaction to occur both molecules must be situated correctly.

<text>The province of Verona (Italian: &quot;provincia di Verona&quot;) is a province of the Veneto region in Italy. On its northwestern border, Lake Garda—Italy&#x27;s largest—is divided between Verona and the provinces of Brescia (Lombardy region) and Trentino (Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region). Its capital is the city of Verona. The city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The province is cosmopolitan in nature. It is bordered by Italian Tyrol in the north, province of Vicenza and province of Padua in the east, province of Rovigo and province of Mantua in the south, and Lake Garda in the west. From north to south the maximum extent of the province is 50 miles while it is 25 miles from east to west.

==Overview==
The province has an area of and a total population of about 0.9 million. There are 98 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province. Important &quot;comuni&quot; include Bovolone, Bonavigo, Bussolengo, Cerea, Isola della Scala, Legnago, Negrar di Valpolicella, Peschiera del Garda, San Bonifacio, San Giovanni Lupatoto, San Martino Buon Albergo, Soave, Sona, Valeggio sul Mincio and Villafranca di Verona.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; takes place in Verona, as do some scenes in his play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. Verona attracts many tourists, and the Casa di Giulietta (Juliet Capulet&#x27;s villa in the play) is an important local visitor attraction. 

Due to its historic importance, the province boasts a large number of castles, towers, hermitages, monasteries, sanctuaries, and old Romanesque parishes. A regional park is located in Lessinia. Valpolicella is popular for its wines which are made from indigenous techniques. Europe&#x27;s biggest natural bridge-Ponte di Veja is located in the province. The northern part of the province is mostly hilly, with several rivers, including Tartaro, Caslagnaro and Adige.

<text>The province of Treviso (&quot;&quot;) is a province in the Veneto region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Treviso. The province is surrounded by Belluno in the north, Vicenza in the west, Padua in southwest, Venice in the south-east and Friuli-Venezia Giulia in the east. The current President of Treviso is Stefano Marcon, elected in September 2016. He is also the current mayor of Castelfranco Veneto.

== History ==
The province of Treviso was established by the Celts but later was flourished under the Romans, in which they had their own district when it became a Municipium, before it was subjugated to Hun, Ostrogoth, and Lombard control. Over time, political power was replaced by ecclesiastical authority, and Treviso was divided into two dioceses around 1000 AD. It evolved into a county, municipality, and later a lordship. In the late 1300s, Treviso fell under the rule of the Republic of Venice and was divided into various regiments and feudal territories, yet it maintained its unity under the &quot;podestà&quot; of Treviso.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the region went through changes with the fall of Venice to France in 1797, then Austria, and back to France again. It was finally organized into departments, districts, and municipalities under French and Austrian rule. After several transitions, the territory was reorganized, and in 1816, it became the new province of Treviso within the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia with ten districts. At the top of the government stood the provincial delegation, supported by the provincial congregation, with advisory functions. This situation was interrupted by the interlude of 1848 when the Republic of San Marco was established: during that brief period, a provisional central government was formed, along with a committee for each district. In 1853, there was a new reorganization of the system, with the abolition of the districts of Motta and Ceneda. This territorial organization remained largely unchanged until the 20th century.

== Geography ==

The province is mostly flat, but it has hilly terrain in the northern region. Along the border with the province of Belluno, there are mountainous areas with peaks reaching over a thousand meters. Mount Grappa and Col Visentin are the highest peaks. Montello, an isolated hill on the right bank of the Piave River, is also noteworthy.

The province is rich in water resources, with numerous springs (known as &quot;fontanassi&quot;) in the mid-low area. The Sile River, originating in Casacorba, flows through Treviso&#x27;s historic center. The main river is the Piave, characterized by a wide gravel bed along most of its course. Other notable watercourses include the Livenza, Monticano, and Meschio, originating from the foothill area.

==Economy==
The province is home to the headquarters of clothing retailer Benetton, Sisley, Stefanel, Geox, Diadora and Lotto Sport Italia, appliance maker De&#x27;Longhi, and bicycle maker Pinarello.

The land is of relatively recent formation, created by drifts taken by the rivers, and subsidence occurs due to natural consolidation as well as to human activities such as drainage, groundwater extraction and methane extraction.

The Canal Bianco is the only other river that flows across the province.
Many canals for drainage have been dug in the province of Rovigo because the Po and the Adige are the first and the third biggest rivers of Italy as for rate of flow and the land has a huge amount of water to deal with; the main canals are the &quot;Collettore Padano&quot;, the &quot;Ceresolo&quot; and the &quot;Valdentro&quot;.

Other streams of historic importance are the &quot;Adigetto&quot; (a former course of the Adige), the &quot;Poazzo&quot; (a former course of the Po) and the &quot;Fossa Polesella&quot; (a former waterway connecting the Canal Bianco with the Po).

The climate is mild continental with high humidity, having sultry summers and foggy winters; precipitation is normal, usually happens in spring and autumn.

=== Main &quot;comuni&quot; by population ===
As of 2011, the main &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) by population are:
== Emigration problem ==
The province of Rovigo suffers the emigration phenomenon even nowadays: young people still use to emigrate to more developed areas of Veneto and of Italy; this leads to population ageing. There are still migrations from rural areas to more developed towns within the boundaries of the province.

== Railway systems ==
The SS434 &quot;Transpolesana&quot;, a long highway, connects Verona with Rovigo and crosses the western part of the province. A13 toll motorway, connecting Bologna with Padua, A31, connecting Badia Polesine and SS434 Transpolesana with Piovene Rocchette, and SS309 &quot;Romea&quot; State Road, connecting Venice with Ravenna, pass through the zone. The A13 motorway exits in the province of Rovigo are &quot;Occhiobello&quot;, &quot;Villamarzana-Rovigo sud&quot; and &quot;Rovigo&quot;, while the only A31 exits in the province are &quot;Badia Polesine&quot; and the final junction with SS434.

== History ==

The territory of the province was first colonized by the Greeks, who founded the colony of Adria in the 12th-11th centuries BC. During the 6th and 5th centuries BC Etruscans and Venetians inhabited the area, followed by the Romans. In the Middle Ages the region was ruled by the Este as part of the Duchy of Ferrara, but Rovigo was not an administrative unit of the duchy, and there was more than one &quot;Podesteria&quot; for each side of the Po river.

After the War of Ferrara in 1484 the Republic of Venice started ruling over the northern part of Polesine; the Venetians designated it a &quot;territorio&quot; whose capital was Rovigo, thus giving the area an administrative unity for the first time. This can be viewed as the start of the province of Rovigo, though its extent was a less than today; the borders were set as the Canal Bianco river with few exceptions: the territories of Polesella, Guarda Veneta, Adria and the delta of the Po were included in the Venetian &quot;territorio&quot; of Rovigo.

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815 all the territories to the north of the Po were included into the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, thus giving the province its modern extent.

== Economy ==
The province is characterized by a thriving agriculture, particularly the cultivation of wheat, maize, rice and sugar beets as well as grapevines, apples, pears, peaches, tomatoes and vegetables.

There are small to medium size factories set in the city of Rovigo and few other centres of the province: they mainly are about food processing (many are sugar refineries), metalworking, carpentry, textile, construction and construction materials.
Many Aquaculture farms are set in the wetlands of the delta of the Po.

The province of Rovigo has some famous holiday villages, as Rosolina Mare, Rosa Pineta, and Albarella Island (&quot;Isola di Albarella&quot; in Italian).

== Delta and nature delta park ==
The eastern portion of the province corresponds with the delta of River Po, a large area where the river subdivides into channels (each with its own name). The delta is also a protected area, because it&#x27;s a national-legally recognized nature park.

<text>The province of Padua () is a province in the Veneto region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Padua.

==Geography==

It has an area of 2,142 km2, and a total population of 936,492 (2016) making it the most populated province of Veneto. There are 102 &quot;comuni&quot; in the province.
The territory is usually divided in the capital city, Padua, and its hinterland, formed by the nearby municipalities; the &quot;alta pianura&quot; (&quot;higher plain&quot;), north of the city; the &quot;bassa pianura&quot; (&quot;lower plain&quot;), south of the city, including the &quot;Saccisica&quot; in the south-east; and the &quot;Colli Euganei&quot; (&quot;Euganei hills&quot;) south-west of the city. The Euganei hills are the only heights of the entire province, the other parts being totally plain.
==History==
The borders of the province are almost the same of the Medieval commune of Padua, with just some adjustment in the north-east. The territory was administered within these boundaries since the time of the Republic of Venice, but the modern province comes directly from the administrative divisions of Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. The Diocese of Padua covers the most part of the province, out of a main part of &quot;alta pianura&quot;; instead it includes areas from the surrounding provinces.

==Main sights==
Padua is home to some masterpieces from Medieval and Renaissance art and architecture, while the towns of Cittadella and Montagnana are known for the well preserved Medieval city walls. There are numerous villas in the countryside, a few of them from Palladio, the main ones being Villa Contarini (in Piazzola sul Brenta) and Villa Barbarigo (in Valsanzibio). The Euganei hills offer a relaxing naturalistic site, often covered in woods, while at their eastern slopes there are many ancient spa sites: the &quot;Terme Euganee&quot;, as Abano Terme, Montegrotto Terme, Galzignano Terme, Battaglia Terme. There is a small part of the Venetian Lagoon lying inside the province, the &quot;Valle Millecampi&quot; (&quot;one-thousand-fields valley&quot;); and also the river landscapes of the countryside include naturalistic routes, even for cycling or horse-riding. Travelling by boat is possible as well.
==Climate==

The most part of the province has a temperate sub-continental climate for the Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;); only part of the Colli Euganei have a milder climate, because their southern slopes are above the thermal inversion line by winter, and exposed to the Sun all the year: which allows them to cultivate small olive trees.

The winter is usually moderately cold in the province, avoiding both warm and cold extremes; frost is very common at plain (below the thermal inversion line) with about 60–70 frost days a year, and temperatures usually do not get lower than −8/−12 °C in the plains during the year; but the all-times record for Padua is −19.2 °C by January 1985. The lower plain is slightly colder than the higher plain; snowfalls are highly variable from year to year, and one could see winters with almost no snow as years with frequent snowfalls (Padua has a century average of almost during a year). Fog is a common phenomenon, even lasting all the day long, above all in the lower plain.

Summers are moderately hot and wet, warmer and less rainy in the lower plain, while the higher plain is often hit by thunderstorms; Padua has a record of +39.8 °C by August 2003, and usually gets above +36 °C in a year.

Spring and autumn are changeable seasons, which may experience wintry or sultry weather, heavy rainfalls or pleasant sunny days. The period between April and June is usually the wettest one in a year.

Extreme events may sometime hit the province. Flooding is a well-known phenomenon since ancient time, so that all the rivers and channels which cross the plain are embanked, and many channels were dug to avoid frequent flooding. The worst recent events were on 4 November 1966 and on 2 November 2010.

Snowstorms, with some inch of fresh snow and strong &quot;Bora&quot; gusts, may happen during a normal winter, but rarely can be considered like a &quot;blizzard&quot;, and usually they do not last more than 1–2 days and with no more than of snow. Anyway, a really exceptional event happened during the winter of 1608: a snowfall that lasted for 40 consecutive days, from late January to early March, with the snow depth at ground reaching at least 6–7 ft (about 2m) as witnessed by Galileo; a similar event never repeated.

Rarely, between May and September, tornadoes may hit the area as well. The most famous were the one of 17 August 1756, bringing heavy damages to Padua; and the one of 11 September 1970, starting from &quot;Colli Euganei&quot; and passing through Paduan metropolitan area to end over Venice, an F2 (intensifying up to F4 going onto Venice) on the Fujita scale. Hailstorms are possible as well by summer, the worst recent event having been on 28 August 2003.

==Economy==

The province has a thriving economy, in the metropolitan area and the &quot;alta pianura&quot;, due to the presence of numerous enterprises of every kind, mainly industrial ones, but also from tertiary and primary economical sectors; these areas are also densely populated. The &quot;bassa pianura&quot; is instead a mainly rural area, thus being poorer and less populated. Tourism is developed above all in the spa towns, while both in Padua and in the other parts of the province it may be considered under-developed, aside from the arrival of large numbers of pilgrims in Padua.

==Transportation==
Two motorways cross the territory, one being the A4, the other being the A13; Padua has also a highway ring surrounding the city and connecting it to its hinterland. The main railways make almost the same paths of the motorways, going to Venice, Milan or Bologna; but there are minor railways going north (Castelfranco Veneto), north-west (Bassano del Grappa and Trento), south-west (Mantua) and south-east (Chioggia). The main roads follow all those paths.

==Sport==

Several sports are practiced in the province of Padua. The most popular is football: every village as well as every city parish has its own little team, out of the most important ones playing in the Italian professional or amateur championships; and futsal is widespread too. Rugby union and volleyball are popular sports too; there are several teams also for basketball and field hockey; water polo, American football and baseball are played too. Among individual sports, cycling, athletics, swimming, rowing, tennis, fencing, golf, and horseback riding are often practiced, as well as martial arts.

<doc id="990217" wikidata="Q15147029" url="?curid=990217" title="Northern Circars">
<text>The Northern Circars (also spelt Sarkars) was a division of British India&#x27;s Madras Presidency. It consisted of a narrow slip of territory lying along the western side of the Bay of Bengal from 15° 40′ to 20° 17′ north latitude, in the present-day Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The Subah of Deccan (Hyderabad/Golconda) consisted of 22 circars. These northern circars were five in number and the most prominent ones in the Subah.

They became British in a protracted piecemeal process lasting from 1758 to 1823, involving diplomacy and financial settlements rather than military conquest. The annexation by the British of the Northern Circars deprived Hyderabad State, the Nizam&#x27;s dominion, of the considerable coastline it formerly had, assuming the shape it is now remembered for that of a landlocked princely state with territories in Central Deccan, bounded on all sides by British India.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Circar&quot; was an English spelling of &quot;sarkar&quot;, a Mughal term for district (a subdivision of a &quot;subah&quot; or province), which had been in use since the time of Sher Shah Suri (1486–1545). &quot;Northern Circars&quot; meant the northern districts of the Nizam&#x27;s dominion.

Eventually &quot;Circar&quot; also acquired the meaning of &quot;British Sarkar&quot;, i.e., the British government. Hence, &quot;Sarkar districts&quot; could also be understood as the districts under the administration of the British government. In British maps, the area might just be labelled &quot;Circars&quot;.

==Geography==
The Northern Circars were five in number: Chicacole (Srikakulam), Rajmandri (Rajahmundry), Ellore (Eluru), Mustaphanagar (Kondapalli) and Murtuzanagar (Guntur), with a total area, was about when Nizam initially lost control of them to the European Colonizers.

In the main, the region at various points of time corresponded to the northern and the central parts of Coastal Andhra region of Andhra Pradesh, including the whole of present-day districts of Guntur, Bapatla, Palnadu, NTR district, Krishna, Eluru, East Godavari, West Godavari, Konaseema, Kakinada, Alluri Sitharama Raju, Anakapalli, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Parvathipuram Manyam and Srikakulam of Andhra Pradesh. It also included parts of the present day Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Nabarangapur and Malkangiri districts of Odisha and a few parts of the Mulugu and Kothagudem districts of Telangana.

==History==
The region was invaded by the Bahmani Sultanate in 1471; in 1541 the Qutb Shahi conquered and extended their conquests over the Guntur and Masulipatnam districts. They appear to have acquired only an imperfect possession of the country, as it was again wrested from Balram Dev I, the ruling Jeypore king and his several feudal lords. The conquest was finally completed in 1571, during the reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda and Hyderabad.

In 1674, Vishwambhar Dev of Jeypore kingdom defeated the Faujdar of Chicacole, appointed by the Qutb Shahi Sultans and claimed an independent semi-monarchy over the Circars. Aurangzeb conquered Golconda in 1687 and the Circars along with the Qutb Shahi Sultanate were annexed to the extensive empire of Aurangzeb. However, the first two Faujdars appointed by the Mughals were defeated and slain in the battlefield by the Maharaja of Jeypore, Raghunath Krishna Dev, who continued to rule claiming independent control over the region until he died in 1708. The successor of Raghunath Krishna proved to be an inefficient ruler and as a result lost a vast territory of the Circars. However, the kings of Jeypore continued to rule their decreased kingdom independently until the advent of the British in 1777. The British destroyed the fort of Jeypore and granted them a demoted status of a Zamindari.

In 1724, Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan was appointed the governor of Hyderabad, with the title &quot;Nizam al Mulk&quot;. He came to be known as the Nizam of Hyderabad, its &quot;de facto&quot; ruler. The fourth Nizam Salabat Jang, a son of the Nizam al Mulk, who was indebted for his elevation to the throne to the French East India Company, granted the district of Kondavid (in the Guntur district) to the French in return for their services, and soon afterwards granted the other circars as well. In 1759, through the conquest of the fortress of Masulipatnam, the maritime provinces from the river Gundlakamma to the Chilka Lake were transferred from the French to the British. But the British left them under the administration of the Nizam, except Masulipatnam, a valuable port, which was retained by the British.

In 1765, Lord Robert Clive obtained from the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II a grant of the five Circars. The fort of Kondapalli was seized by the British as an opening move. On 12 November 1766, a treaty of alliance was signed with Nizam Ali Khan by which the British undertook to maintain troops for Nizam&#x27;s assistance. By a second treaty, often referred to as the Treaty of Masulipatnam, signed on 1 March 1768, the Nizam acknowledged the validity of Shah Alam&#x27;s grant and resigned the Circars to the British East India Company, receiving as a mark of friendship an annuity of £50,000. Guntur, as the personal estate of the Nizam&#x27;s brother Basalat Jang, was excepted from British rule during his lifetime under both treaties. He died in 1782, but it was not till 1788 that Guntur came under British administration. Finally, in 1823, the claims of the Nizam over the Northern Circars were bought outright by the company, and they became a British possession.
The Northern Circars were governed as part of Madras Presidency until India&#x27;s independence in 1947, after which the presidency became India&#x27;s Madras State. The northern, Telugu-speaking portion of Madras state, including the Northern Circars, was detached in 1953 to form a new &#x27;Andhra State&#x27;. The Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking parts of Hyderabad State in 1956 to form a united Andhra Pradesh. The two were bifurcated again in 2014 as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

<text>A guestbook (also guest book, visitor log, visitors&#x27; book, visitors&#x27; album) is a paper or electronic means for a visitor to acknowledge a visit to a site, physical or web-based, and leave details such as their name, postal or electronic address and any comments. Such paper-based ledgers or books are traditional in churches, at weddings, funerals, B&amp;Bs, museums, schools, institutions and other private facilities open to the public. Some private homes keep visitors&#x27; books. Specialised forms of guestbooks include hotel registers, wherein guests are required to provide their contact information, and Books of Condolence, which are used at funeral homes and more generally after notable public deaths, such as the death of a monarch or president, or after a public disaster, such as an airplane crash.

On the web, a guestbook is a logging system that allows visitors of a website to leave a public comment. It is possible in some guestbooks for visitors to express their thoughts about the website or its subject. Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain feedback from them. This allows the webmaster to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a script, which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as Perl, PHP, Python or ASP. Many free guestbook hosts and scripts exist.

Names and addresses provided in guestbooks, paper-based or electronic, are frequently recorded and collated for use in providing statistics about visitors to the site, and to contact visitors to the site in the future. Because guestbooks are considered ephemeral objects, historians, literary scholars and other academic researchers have been increasingly eager to identify and help conserve them.

<text>The Gangster Disciple Nation (often abbreviated as the GD&#x27;s; formally, GDN), also known as Growth &amp; Development, is an African American street and prison gang founded by former rivals David Barksdale and Larry Hoover; in 1968, the two came together to form the Black Gangster Disciple Nation (BGDN).

Post-1989, following growing tension between the two over declining leadership, the BGDN split into two new factions—Hoover&#x27;s Gangster Disciple Nation (GDN) and Barksdale&#x27;s Black Disciple Nation (BDN), respectively. As of 2022, following Hoover&#x27;s departure, the GDN has no full-time leadership role.

== History ==
The origins of the Gangster Disciples began in Englewood (in Chicago, Illinois&#x27;s South Side) in 1964, when then 13-year-old Larry &#x27;The King&#x27; Hoover joined a small street gang called the &#x27;Supreme Gangsters&#x27;. For years, the Supreme Gangsters had an outstanding war with the Black Disciples Nation, led by David Barksdale. In 1969, Hoover and Barksdale agreed to a ceasefire. This resulted in the creation of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation. By the early 1970s, the BGDN dominated the Chicago gang scene. Barksdale died of kidney failure in 1974, at the age of 27. Following his death, Hoover assumed full control of the Black Gangster Disciples.

=== Folks Nation ===

In 1978, the BGDN began to splinter into three distinct factions: Black Gangsters, Black Disciples and Gangster Disciples; however, Hoover (at the time incarcerated on murder charges) prevented it by quickly setting up an alliance of all street and prison gangs in his interest into one family.

The alliance consisted of Gangster Disciples, Black Disciples, Satan Disciples, Latin Disciples, Spanish Gangster Disciples, Ambrose, Two-One Boys, Two-Two Boys, Two-Sixers/Two-Six Boys, Simon City Royals, North Side Insane Popes, La Raza, Spanish Cobras, Imperial Gangsters, Harrison Gents, and the Latin Eagles.

=== Expansions ===
The Gangster Disciples are active in over 100 cities and 50 states, predominantly in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, and remnants also maintain a significant presence in the U.S. prison system. The gang had between approximately 50,000 and 90,000 members. The gang had expanded through the North and West Sides of Chicago, as well as Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Birmingham, Hattiesburg, and co-founder Hoover&#x27;s birthplace of Jackson. They first emerged in significant numbers in Memphis, Tennessee in the 1980s, the first modern street gang to do so.

=== Splintering of the Black Disciples ===
In 1989, Hoover&#x27;s attention of the Black Gangster Disciples began to die down as he focused solely on the Gangster Disciples, enraging parts of the BGDN&#x27;s subsets and the Folk Nation. Members of the Black Disciples decided to splinter from the Black Gangster Disciples, resulting in the reinvention of the original gang name and the incorporation of the new Gangster Disciples. Other members who felt disrespected by Hoover&#x27;s declining orders decided to get his attention again by instigating gang-related shootings toward the new GD&#x27;s. Two noted shootings that related to the dispute between the two Disciple gangs was a drug-related shooting that killed some members of the Gangster Disciples and the 1991 revenge murder of Black Disciple leader Mickey &quot;Bull&quot; Johnson.

== Notable incidents of gang-related violence ==

On July 3, 2005, men claiming to be members of the Gangster Disciples street gang killed Sergeant Juwan Johnson of the U.S. Army in the small town of Hohenecken (part of the city of Kaiserslautern) near Ramstein, Germany. Prosecutors accused U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Rico Williams of being the first one to start attacking Johnson in a six-minute beating that he had to endure to join the gang. After the beating Johnson asked one of his fellow gang members to take him to the hospital. Williams then ordered his gang members not to take him there. Johnson later died from multiple blunt-force trauma injuries. According to the government&#x27;s investigations, Williams was the leader of the gang set operating on base. Senior Airman Williams was sentenced to 22 years in prison, while other servicemen faced sentences ranging from 2 to 12 years. Some of the charges against the servicemen were: Williams, second-degree murder and witness tampering; Air Force Staff Sergeant Jerome Jones, conspiracy to commit assault, gang participation, and other charges; Airman Nicholas Sims and Army Sergeant Rodney Howell; involuntary manslaughter; Private Terrance Norman, voluntary manslaughter.

The Gangster Disciples were implicated in the 2008 murders of member Cecil Dotson Sr., his fiancée Marissa Williams, fellow member Hollis Seals, and his girlfriend Shindri Roberson. Also killed were Cecil and Marissa&#x27;s 4-year-old son Cemario and Cecil&#x27;s son with Erica Smith, 2-year-old Cecil Dotson II. The toddler had been spending the night with his father and siblings. Severely injured in the attack were Cecil and Marissa&#x27;s other three children nine-year-old Cecil Dotson Jr., five-year-old Cedric and two-month-old Ce&#x27;niyah. Allegations were originally made that the Gangster Disciples were responsible for the event which came to be known as &quot;The Lester Street Massacre&quot; and was featured in two separate episodes of &quot;The First 48&quot; on A&amp;E. Cecil and his family were butchered by Dotson&#x27;s own brother, Jessie, who eventually confessed to the killings. He was convicted on all counts and sentenced to six death sentences plus 120 years for the three children (his niece and nephews) that he attempted to kill. The Gangster Disciples were cleared of any involvement.

On July 21, 2020, a car pulled up to a funeral home in Chicago&#x27;s Englewood area, and two gunmen infiltrated the property, opening fire. Fifteen people were wounded, with no reported fatalities. The funeral was for a victim killed a week prior, and was allegedly involving a dispute between two Gangster Disciples factions. At least 60 shots were fired, and there were victims &quot;all up and down 79th street&quot;.

== Arrests and incarcerations ==
In 1989, a member of the Gangster Disciples was arrested on felony drug-related offenses. He was found guilty and sentenced to 28 years in prison.

On April 27, 2016, 32 members of Gangster Disciples were arrested on RICO charges by federal agents. Among the 32 arrested was a former Atlanta-area police officer who prosecutors say was a hit man for the gang. The indictment alleges that Gangster Disciples members committed 10 murders, 12 attempted murders, 2 robberies, the extortion of rap artists to force the artists to become affiliated with the Gangster Disciples, and fraud resulting in losses of over $450,000. In addition, the Gangster Disciples trafficked in large amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, illegal prescription drugs, and marijuana. The indictment also seek forfeiture of 34 different firearms seized as part of the investigation.

On January 25, 2021, seven members of the gang throughout Naperville, Illinois, and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, were all arrested and charged with RICO-related federal charges. The charges alleged that on April 28, 2018, three members under a leader&#x27;s order, allegedly killed Leroy Allen as part of a leadership dispute at a Gangster Disciples meeting in Bridgeton, Missouri. A month later, on May 18, two other members allegedly killed Ernest Wilson, a rival board member, in Chicago. Other acts of violence alleged as part of the conspiracy include a nightclub stabbing in East St. Louis, Illinois, a nonfatal shooting in Cape Girardeau and multiple unsuccessful murder plots. The seven-member indictment also claimed drug trafficking by two members, including a scheme to smuggle the synthetic drug &quot;K2&quot; into a Scott County, Missouri state prison.

On February 25, 2025 reputed Gangster Disciples gang member and sex offender James Robert Stiver was captured in El Paso, Texas.

=== Indictment, incarceration and departure of Larry Hoover ===
On August 22, 1995, after a 17-year undercover joint investigation by the Illinois Department of Corrections, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Hoover was arrested for conspiracy, extortion, money laundering, drug-related offenses, and continuing to engage in a criminal enterprise. The investigation used wiretaps to determine that Hoover was still operating in illegal activities within the GDs. In 1997, he stood trial in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Hoover was found guilty on all charges. He was sentenced to three additional life terms in federal prison. Hoover is currently serving his sentence at the ADX Florence in Fremont County, Colorado.

In July 2022, Hoover claimed to have renounced his gang ties, ending his affiliation with the Gangster Disciples.

== Symbolism/colors ==
The predominant symbols of this gang are the trident and the Star of David, the latter a reference to co-founder David Barksdale.

<text>Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher Parrish Friede (July 3, 1908 – June 22, 1992), writing as M.F.K. Fisher, was an American food writer. She was a founder of the Napa Valley Wine Library. Over her lifetime she wrote 27 books, among them &quot;Consider the Oyster&quot; (1941), &quot;How to Cook a Wolf&quot; (1942), &quot;The Gastronomical Me&quot; (1943) and a translation of Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s &quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot;. Fisher believed that eating well was just one of the &quot;arts of life&quot; and explored this in her writing. W. H. Auden once remarked, &quot;I do not know of anyone in the United States who writes better prose.&quot; In 1991 the &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board went so far as to say, &quot;Calling M.F.K. Fisher, who has just been elected to the American Academy and National Institute of Arts and Letters, a food writer is a lot like calling Mozart a tunesmith. At the same time that she is celebrating, say, oysters (which lead, she says, &#x27;a dreadful but exciting life&#x27;) or the scent of orange segments drying on a radiator, she is also celebrating life and loneliness, sense and sensibility.&quot;

==Early life==
Fisher was born Mary Frances Kennedy on July 3, 1908, at 202 Irwin Avenue, Albion, Michigan. She told Albion City Historian Frank Passic:

Rex was a co-owner (with his brother Walter) and editor of the Albion &quot;Evening Recorder&quot; newspaper.

In 1911, Rex sold his interest in the paper to his brother, and moved the family to the West Coast, where he hoped to buy a fruit or citrus orchard. The family spent some time in Washington with relatives, and then traveled down the coast to Ventura, California, where Rex nearly purchased an orange grove, but backed out after discovering soil problems. He next purchased and briefly owned the &quot;Oxnard Courier&quot; in Oxnard, California. From there he traveled to San Diego and worked for a local newspaper. In 1912 he purchased a controlling interest in the &quot;Whittier News&quot; and moved the family to Whittier, California. Rex initially purchased a house at 115 Painter Avenue. In 1919, he purchased a large white house outside the city limits on South Painter Avenue. The house sat on thirteen acres, with an orange grove; it was referred to by the family as &quot;The Ranch.&quot; Although Whittier was primarily a Quaker community at that time, Mary Frances was brought up within the Episcopal Church.

Mary Frances enjoyed reading as a child, and began writing poetry at the age of five. The Kennedys had a vast home library, and her mother provided her access to many other books. Later, her father used her as stringer on his paper, and she would draft as many as fifteen stories a day.

Mary Frances received a formal education; however, she was an indifferent student who often skipped classes throughout her academic career. At the age of sixteen, her parents enrolled her in a private school: The Bishop&#x27;s School in La Jolla, California. After one year there, she transferred to the Harker School for Girls in Palo Alto, California, adjacent to Stanford University; she graduated from Harker in 1927. Upon graduation, she attended Illinois College, but left after only one semester, In 1928, she enrolled in summer school at UCLA in order to obtain enough credits to transfer to Occidental College. While there, she met her future first husband: Alfred Fisher (&quot;Al&quot;). She attended Occidental College for one year; however, she married Al on September 5, 1929, and moved with him to Dijon, France.

== Career ==
Food became an early passion in her life. Her earliest memory of taste was &quot;the grayish-pink fuzz my grandmother skimmed from a spitting kettle of strawberry jam&quot;. Her maternal grandmother Holbrook lived with them until her death in 1920. During that period, Holbrook was a source of tension in the household. She was a stern, rather joyless person, and a Campbellite who firmly believed in overcooked, bland food. She was also a follower of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg&#x27;s dietary restrictions at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Fisher would later write that during her grandmother&#x27;s absences at religious conventions:
An early food influence was &quot;Aunt&quot; Gwen. Aunt Gwen was not family, but the daughter of friends — the Nettleship family — &quot;a strange family of English medical missionaries who preferred tents to houses.&quot; The Nettleships had an encampment on Laguna Beach, and Mary Frances would camp out there with Gwen. Rex would later buy the campsite and a cabin that had been built on it. Mary Frances recalled cooking outdoors with Gwen: steaming mussels on fresh seaweed over hot coals; catching and frying rock bass; skinning and cooking eel; and, making fried egg sandwiches to carry on hikes. Mary Frances wrote of her meals with Gwen and Gwen&#x27;s brothers: &quot;I decided at the age of nine that one of the best ways to grow up is to eat and talk quietly with good people.&quot; Mary Frances liked to cook meals in the kitchen at home, and &quot;easily fell into the role of the cook&#x27;s helper.&quot;

===Dijon===

In September 1929, newlyweds Mary Frances and Al sailed on the RMS &quot;Berengaria&quot; to Cherbourg (now Cherbourg-Octeville), France. They traveled to Paris for a brief stay, before continuing south to Dijon. They initially found a rental at 14 Rue du Petit-Potet in a home owned by the Ollangnier family. The lodgings consisted of two rooms, with no kitchen, and no separate bathroom. Al attended the Faculté des Lettres at the University of Dijon where he was working on his doctorate; when not in class, he worked on his epic poem, &quot;The Ghosts in the Underblows.&quot; The poem was based on the Bible and was analogous to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By 1931, Fisher had finished the first twelve books of the poem, which he ultimately expected to contain sixty books. Mary Frances attended night classes at the École des Beaux-Arts where she spent three years studying painting and sculpture. The Ollangniers served good food at home, although Madame Ollangnier was &quot;extremely penurious and stingy.&quot; Mary Frances remembered big salads made at the table, deep-fried Jerusalem artichokes, and &quot;reject cheese&quot; that was always good. To celebrate their three-month anniversary, Al and Mary Frances went to the Aux Trois Faisans restaurant — their first of many visits. There, Mary Frances received her education in fine wine from a sommelier named Charles. The Fishers visited all the restaurants in town, where in Mary Frances&#x27;s words:

In 1930, Lawrence Clark Powell came to Dijon to obtain his doctorate at the University of Burgundy. He came at Mary Frances&#x27;s suggestion. Powell had become acquainted with Mary Frances when her sister was attending Occidental College, and roomed with Powell&#x27;s girlfriend. Powell moved into the attic above the Fishers and became lifelong friends with Mary Frances. He described the food at the Fishers&#x27; pensione: In 1931, Mary Frances and Al moved to their own apartment, above a pastry shop at 26 Rue Monge. It was Mary Frances&#x27;s first kitchen. It was only five feet by three feet and contained a two-burner hotplate. Despite the kitchen&#x27;s limitations, or perhaps because of it, Mary Frances began developing her own personal cuisine, with the goal of &quot;cooking meals that would &#x27;shake [her guests] from their routines, not only of meat-potatoes-gravy, but of thought, of behavior.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;The Gastronomical Me&quot; she describes one such meal:

After Al was awarded his doctorate, they moved briefly to Strasbourg, France, where Al continued to study and write. Mary Frances became depressed from loneliness and being cooped up in a cold, dank apartment. Unable to afford better accommodations, the Fishers next moved to a tiny French fishing village, Le Cros-de-Cagnes. Powell visited with them there for six weeks and observed that Al was growing more introspective. He had stopped work on his poem, was trying to write novels and did not want to return to the States where he knew job prospects were poor. He could not, however, see a way to stay in France. After running out of funds, the Fishers returned to California, sailing on the &quot;Feltre&quot; out of Marseilles.

===California===

Back in California, Al and Mary Frances initially moved in with Mary Frances&#x27;s family at &quot;The Ranch&quot;. They later moved into the Laguna cabin. This was during the Great Depression and work was hard to find. Al spent two years looking for a teaching position until he found one at Occidental College. Mary Frances began writing and she published her first piece — &quot;Pacific Village&quot; — in the February 1935 issue of &quot;Westways&quot; magazine (previously known as &quot;Touring Topics&quot;). The article was a fictional account of life in Laguna Beach. In 1934, Lawrence Powell moved to Laguna with his wife Fay. In 1933, Dillwyn Parrish and his wife Gigi moved next door to them, and they rapidly became friends.

When Al began teaching at Occidental, the Fishers initially moved to Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, where the Parrishes helped them paint and fix up an older house they had rented. Unfortunately the home was sold shortly thereafter, and the Fishers had to move to another rented house in Highland Park. Mary Frances worked part-time in a card shop and researched old cookery books at the Los Angeles Public Library. She began writing short pieces on gastronomy. Parrish&#x27;s sister Anne showed them to her publisher at Harpers who expressed an interest in them. The pieces were later to become her first book: &quot;Serve It Forth.&quot; Mary Frances next began work on a novel she never finished; it was based on the founding of Whittier.

During this period, Mary Frances&#x27;s marriage with Al was beginning to fail. After Parrish divorced Gigi in 1934, Mary Frances found herself falling in love with him. In Mary&#x27;s words, she one day sat next to Parrish at the piano and told him she loved him. Mary Frances&#x27;s biographer Joan Reardon, however, interviewed Gigi who told a different story. She stated that Parrish told her that one night after he had dined alone with Mary Frances, she later let herself into his house and slipped into bed with him. In 1935, with Al&#x27;s permission, Mary Frances traveled to Europe with Parrish and his mother. The Parrishes had money, and they sailed on the luxury liner &quot;Hansa&quot;. While in Europe, they spent four days in Paris, and traveled through Provence, Languedoc, and the French Riviera. Mary Frances also revisited Dijon and ate with Parrish at Aux Trois Faisans where she was recognized and served by her old friend, the waiter Charles. She later wrote a piece on their visit — &quot;The Standing and the Waiting&quot; — which was to become the centerpiece of &quot;Serve It Forth.&quot; Upon her return from Europe, Mary Frances informed Al of her developing relationship with Parrish. In 1936, Dillwyn invited the Fishers to join him in creating an artists&#x27; colony at Le Paquis — a two-story stone house that Parrish had bought with his sister north of Vevey, Switzerland. Notwithstanding the clear threat to his marriage, Al agreed.

===Vevey===

The Fishers sailed to Holland on a small Dutch passenger freighter, and from there took a train to Vevey. &quot;Le Paquis&quot; means the grazing ground. The house sat on a sloping meadow on the north shore of Lake Geneva, looking across to the snowcapped Alps. They had a large garden in which In mid-1937 Al and Mary Frances separated. He traveled to Austria and then returned to the States where he began a distinguished career as a teacher and poet at Smith College. In a December 2, 1938, letter to Powell, Mary Frances explained her side of the marital breakup. She stated that Al was afraid of physical love; he was sexually impotent in their marriage. Moreover, he was an intellectual loner who was emotionally estranged from Mary Frances. Mary Frances stated that contrary to Al&#x27;s belief, she had not left him for another man; she had left him because he could not satisfy her emotional and physical needs. In 1938, Mary Frances returned home briefly to inform her parents in person of her separation and pending divorce from Al.

Meanwhile, her first book, &quot;Serve It Forth&quot;, had opened to largely glowing reviews, including reviews in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Fisher, however, was disappointed in the book&#x27;s meager sales because she needed the money. During this same period, Fisher and Parrish also co-wrote (alternating chapters) a light romance entitled &quot;Touch and Go&quot; under the pseudonym Victoria Berne. The book was published by Harper and Brothers in 1939.

In September 1938, Fisher and Parrish could no longer afford to live at Les Paquis and they moved to Bern. After only two days in Bern, however, Parrish suffered severe cramping in his left leg. Hospitalized, he underwent two surgeries to remove clots. Gangrene then set in and his left leg had to be amputated. Parrish was in considerable pain and could not get a good diagnosis from his doctors. With the onset of World War II, and Parrish&#x27;s need for medical care, Fisher and Parrish returned to the States, where he saw a number of doctors. He ultimately was diagnosed as having Buerger&#x27;s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans) — a circulatory system malady that causes extreme thrombosis of the arteries and veins, causing severe pain, and often necessitating multiple amputations. The disease is progressive and there was (and is) no known successful treatment. They returned briefly to Switzerland to close down their apartment, and returned to California. They also needed to accumulate a stock of the painkiller Analgeticum, the only one that Parrish found efficacious, unavailable in the States.

===California and Provence===
Once in California, Fisher searched for a warm dry climate that would be beneficial for Parrish&#x27;s health. She found a small cabin on ninety acres of land south of Hemet, California. They bought the property and named it &quot;Bareacres&quot; after the character Lord Bareacres in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by Thackeray. Lord Bareacres was land-poor; his only asset was his estate. Fisher wrote Powell: &quot;God help us ... We&#x27;ve put our last penny into 90 acres of rocks and rattlesnakes.&quot; Although Parrish&#x27;s life at Bareacres had its ups and downs, its course was a downward spiral. He continued to paint, and Powell staged an exhibition of his works. Fisher was always trying to find ways to obtain Analgeticum; she even wrote President Roosevelt at one point to urge him to lift the import restriction on the drug. Ultimately, Parrish could no longer tolerate the pain and the probable need for additional amputations. On the morning of August 6, 1941, Fisher was awakened by a gunshot. Venturing outside, she discovered that Parrish had committed suicide. Fisher later would write, &quot;I have never understood some (a lot of) taboos and it seems silly to me to make suicide one of them in our social life.&quot;

During the period leading up to Tim&#x27;s death (Parrish was often called &quot;Tim&quot; by family and friends, but referred to as &quot;Chexbres&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s autobiographical books), Fisher completed three books. The first was a novel entitled &quot;The Theoretical Foot.&quot; It was a fictional account of expatriates enjoying a summer romp when the protagonist, suffering great pain, ends up losing a leg. Transparently based on Tim, the novel was rejected by publishers. The second book was an unsuccessful attempt by her to revise a novel written by Tim, &quot;Daniel Among the Women.&quot; Third, she completed and published &quot;Consider the Oyster,&quot; which she dedicated to Tim. The book was humorous and informative. It contained numerous recipes incorporating oysters, mixed with musings on the history of the oyster, oyster cuisine, and the love life of the oyster.

In 1942, Fisher published &quot;How to Cook a Wolf.&quot; The book was published at the height of WWII food shortages. &quot;Pages offered housewives advice on how to achieve a balanced diet, stretch ingredients, eat during blackouts, deal with sleeplessness and sorrow, and care for pets during wartime.&quot; The book received good reviews and attained literary success, leading to a feature article on Fisher in &quot;Look&quot; magazine in July 1942.

In May 1942 Fisher began working in Hollywood for Paramount Studios. While there she wrote gags for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour. Fisher became pregnant in 1943, and secluded herself in a boarding house in Altadena. While there she worked on the book that would become &quot;The Gastronomical Me.&quot; On August 15, 1943, she gave birth to Anne Kennedy Parrish (later known as Anna). Fisher listed a fictional father on the birth certificate, Michael Parrish. Fisher initially claimed she had adopted the baby; she never revealed the father&#x27;s identity.

In 1944, Fisher broke her contract with Paramount. On a trip to New York, she met and fell in love with publisher Donald Friede. In a letter to Powell she wrote, &quot;I accidentally got married to Donald Friede.&quot; She spent the summer in Greenwich Village with Friede, working on the book that would become &quot;Let Us Feast.&quot; Her relationship with Friede gave her entree to additional publishing markets, and she wrote articles for &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Town and Country&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Woman&quot; and &quot;Gourmet&quot;. In fall 1945, Friede&#x27;s publishing entity failed, and Fisher and Friede returned to Bareacres, both to write. On March 12, 1946, Fisher gave birth to her second daughter, Kennedy Mary Friede. Fisher began work on &quot;With Bold Knife and Fork.&quot;

Mary Frances&#x27;s mother died in 1948. In 1949, she moved to the Ranch to take care of her father, Rex. On Christmas Eve 1949, the limited edition release of her translation of Savarin&#x27;s &quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot; received rave reviews. &quot;Craig Claiborne of the &quot;New York Times&quot; said Fisher&#x27;s prose perfectly captured the wit and gaiety of the book and lauded the hundreds of marginal glosses that [she] added to elucidate the text.&quot; During this period, Fisher also was working on a biography of Madame Récamier for which she had received an advance. Her marriage with Donald was starting to unravel. He became ill with intestinal pains and after considerable medical treatment, it became apparent that the pain was psychosomatic, and Don began receiving psychiatric care. Fisher in turn had been under considerable stress. She had been caretaker for Tim, had weathered his suicide, suffered her brother&#x27;s suicide a year later, followed by the death of her mother, only to be thrust into the role of caretaker for Rex. Despite her financially successful writing career, Don lived a lifestyle that exceeded their income, leaving her $27,000 in debt. She sought psychiatric counseling for what essentially was a nervous breakdown. By 1949, Donald had become frustrated by his isolation in a small Southern California town and separated from Fisher. Don sought further treatment at the Harkness Pavilion in New York. Fisher and Friede divorced on August 8, 1950.

Her father died June 2, 1953. Mary Frances subsequently sold the Ranch and the newspaper. She rented out Bareacres and moved to Napa Valley, renting &quot;Red Cottage&quot; south of St. Helena, California. Dissatisfied with the educational opportunities available to her children, Fisher sailed to France in 1954. She ended up in Aix-en-Provence, France. She planned to live in Aix using the proceeds from the sale of her father&#x27;s paper.

Once in Aix, Fisher lodged with Mme Lanes at 17 rue Cardinale. She employed a French tutor and enrolled Anna and Kennedy, then aged 11 and 8, in the École St Catherine. She described Mme Lanes as &quot;incredibly fusty and &#x27;correcte,&#x27;&quot; part of the &quot;poor but proud aristocracy.&quot; In Aix, her life developed a pattern. Each day she would walk across town to pick up the girls from school at noon, and in late afternoon they ate snacks or ices at the Deux Garçons or Glacière. She never felt completely at home. She felt patronized because she was an American: &quot;I was forever in their eyes the product of a naïve, undeveloped, and indeed infantile civilization ...&quot;. At one point, an important local woman, introduced to her through mutual friends in Dijon, invited her to lunch. During the meal, the woman sneered at Fisher:

===St. Helena===
Fisher left Provence in July 1955, and sailed for San Francisco on the freighter &quot;Vesuvio&quot;. After living in the city for a short period, she decided that the intense urban environment did not provide the children enough freedom. She sold Bareacres and used the proceeds to buy an old Victorian house on Oak Street in St. Helena. She owned the house until 1970, using it as a base for frequent travels. During extended absences she would rent it out.

In fall 1959 she moved the family to Lugano, Switzerland, where she hoped to introduce her daughters to a new language and culture. She enrolled the girls in the Istituto Sant&#x27;Anna Convent boarding school. She revisited Dijon and Aix. Falling back in love with Aix, she rented the L&#x27;Harmas farmhouse outside Aix. In July 1961, she returned to San Francisco.

In 1963, Fisher decided to try her hand at teaching at the African-American Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi. It was not a good experience for her. She received mixed reviews and was not invited back for another term.

She next contracted to write a series of cookbook reviews for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. Because her St. Helena house was rented out, she moved to her sister&#x27;s home in Genoa, Nevada, to work on the assignment.

In 1966, Time-Life hired Fisher to write &quot;The Cooking of Provincial France&quot;. She traveled to Paris to research material for the book. While there, she met Paul and Julia Child, and through them James Beard. Child was hired to be a consultant on the book; Michael Field was the consulting editor. Field rented out the Childs&#x27; country home — La Pitchoune — to work on the book. When Fisher later moved into the house immediately after Field, she found the refrigerator empty. She remarked: &quot;How could a person who loves food be in the south of France and not at least have a piece of cheese in the refrigerator?&quot; Fisher was disappointed in the book&#x27;s final form; it contained restaurant recipes, without regard to regional cuisine, and much of her signature prose had been cut.

===Glen Ellen, California===
In 1971, Fisher&#x27;s friend David Bouverie, who owned a ranch in Glen Ellen, California, offered to build Fisher a house on his ranch. Fisher designed it, calling it &quot;Last House&quot;. The presence of ranch staff made it easy for her to use the house as a base for frequent travels. She returned to France in 1970, 1973, 1976 and 1978, visiting, inter alia, La Roquette, Marseilles, and Aix. 


==Death==
After Dillwyn Parrish&#x27;s death, Fisher considered herself a &quot;ghost&quot; of a person, but she continued to have a long and productive life, dying at the age of 83 in Glen Ellen, California, in 1992. She had long suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and arthritis. She spent the last twenty years of her life in &quot;Last House&quot;.

<doc id="990229" wikidata="Q296721" url="?curid=990229" title="Oil wrestling">
<text>Oil wrestling (), also called grease wrestling, is a traditional Turkish sport where participants, called &quot;pehlivan&quot; (wrestlers) or &quot;başpehlivan&quot; (master wrestlers), wrestle while covered in oil. Competitions are held in a proving ground called an &quot;er meydanı&quot;.

Oil wrestling was performed by ancient communities 4,500 years ago in Thrace and the Balkans. As the Ottoman Empire extended into Europe, oil wrestling competitions have been held ceremoniously until modern times.

Unlike Olympic wrestling, oil wrestling matches may be won by achieving an effective hold of the . Thus, the &quot;pehlivan&quot; aims to control his opponent by putting his arm through the latter&#x27;s &quot;kisbet&quot;. To win by using this move is called &quot;paça kazık&quot;. Originally, matches had no set duration and could go on for one or two days until one man was able to establish his superiority, but in 1975 the duration was capped at 40 minutes for the &quot;baspehlivan&quot; and 30 minutes for the &quot;pehlivan&quot; category. If there is no winner, play continues for another 15 minutes in the &quot;baspelivan&quot; or 10 minutes in the &quot;pehlivan&quot; category, wherein scores are kept to determine the victor.

The annual Kırkpınar tournament, held in Edirne in Turkish Thrace since 1346, is the oldest continuously running, sanctioned sporting competition in the world. Oil wrestling festivals also take place in the Turkish-inhabited regions of Bulgaria (Ludogorie and Rhodopes), as well as northern Greece in Eastern Macedonia (Serres region) and West Thrace (Rhodope Mountains).

==History==
The Turkish word for wrestling can be traced back to the Oghuz Turkic languages, which originate from the Eurasian steppes. After the conquest of Anatolia by Seljuk Turks, a form of traditional freestyle wrestling called &quot;Karakucak Güreşi&quot; (literally &quot;Ground hug&quot;) was popularized, where special leather clothing was worn and wrestlers commenced the competition by pouring olive oil on their bodies. This form evolved into what is currently known as &quot;Yağlı Güreş&quot;, or Turkish oil wrestling. In the Ottoman Empire, wrestlers trained in special schools called &quot;tekke&quot; (), which were both athletic and spiritual centers.
Oil wrestling can be traced back to ancient Sumer and Babylon. Cognate forms of folk wrestling practiced by Turkic-speakers are found throughout Western Eurasia (i.e. Europe and Central Asia) under the names Köraş, Khuresh, Kurash, etc.. Greco-Roman traditions also point to the practice of oil wrestling.
Wrestlers oil one another prior to matches as a demonstration of balance and mutual respect. If a man defeats an older opponent, he kisses the latter&#x27;s hand (a sign of respect for elders in Turkey).

Matches are held all over Turkey throughout the year, but in early summer, around 1000 competitors gather in Kırkpınar for an annual three-day wrestling tournament to determine who will be the winner, or &quot;başpehlivan&quot; (&quot;chief wrestler&quot;), of Turkey. Evidence from Ottoman chronicles and documents indicate that the Kırkpınar Games have been held every year since 1362. The Guinness Book of World Records accepts this as the world&#x27;s oldest continually sanctioned sporting competition. The games have only been cancelled about 70 times. In 1924, they were moved to the present location after the Balkan War, some from the original site.

There are some organized oil wrestling competitions outside Turkey, particularly the ones regulated by the Royal Dutch Power Sport Federation (&quot;Koninklijke Nederlandse Krachtsport en Fitnessfederatie&quot; (KNKF)) in the Netherlands.

==Peşrev==
The most important of rituals is &quot;peşrev&quot;, a theatrical introduction to wrestling, prayer, and warm-up at the same time. Rituals like peşrev also exist in the other kinds of Turkish traditional wrestling (&quot;karakucak&quot;, &quot;aba&quot; &quot;güreş&quot;), but they are much simpler and don&#x27;t have a developed symbolism. At the beginning of &quot;peşrev&quot;, wrestlers line up in rows with the main &quot;pehlivan&quot; (&quot;başpehlivan&quot;, the winner of the previous competitions) on the right. Wrestlers then look toward the &quot;Kıbla&quot;&#x27;s side; they take the right hand of the competitor in their own right hand, take the competitor&#x27;s left hand in their left hand, and listen to &quot;cazgır&quot; prayer. Holding each other&#x27;s hands means: &quot;You are more than a brother for me; you are my comrade in a holy war, in struggle on the way of martyrdom (&quot;şehadet&quot;). We are like heroes Ali and Selim, who became founders of Kırkpınar, we are their representatives now&quot;.

==Kıspet==
A wrestler&#x27;s garment comprises only leather pants below the knee called &quot;kıspet&quot;. &quot;Kıspet&quot; is derived from the Arabic word Kiswa, and adheres to the minimum modesty standard of Muslim men where the garment starts at the belt and goes down to just below the knee, covering their Awra. The word itself came to the Ottoman language through Persian. Until the 1960s, kıspets were made of buffalo skin and weighed between 12–13 kg. Nowadays, they&#x27;re typically made of calfskin and weigh about 1.8 kg or 2.5 kg when oiled.

==Rules==
According to the rules of oil wrestling, the loser is the wrestler whose back touches the ground as a result of the opponent&#x27;s actions (&quot;showing belly to the stars&quot;); sitting supported by two hands behind them; touching the ground with both elbows or elbow and hand. The winner is the wrestler who raises his opponent and either carries him three steps or spins him around. If a wrestler&#x27;s &quot;kıspet&quot; gets pulled down (revealing his genitals), he loses as well, though losing under such circumstances is unlikely.

Before 1975 the duration of each wrestling match was unlimited, which was highly inconvenient from the competition&#x27;s organizational point of view as matches could drag on for hours. Currently, wrestling is limited to 30 minutes in young categories, and 40 minutes for masters. The winner of a final tournament receives the title of &quot;başpehlivan&quot; and a monetary award. A &quot;pehlivan&quot; who won three years successively is awarded a Golden belt. Second and third place winners are also awarded, and all participating pehlivans receive &quot;trip money.&quot;

<text>The province of Terni () is the smaller of the two provinces in the Umbria region of Italy, comprising one-third of both the area and population of the region. Its capital is the city of Terni. The province came into being in 1927, when it was carved out of the original unitary province of Umbria.

The province of Terni has an area of 2,122 km2 and a population of 228,836 (2016). There are 33 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province.

In June 2006, the only &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) with a population over 10,000 were Terni, Orvieto, Narni and Amelia.

== Geography ==
It is bordered to the north with the province of Perugia, to the east, south and west with the Lazio (province of Rieti and province of Viterbo) and to north-west with the Tuscany (province of Siena). The province extends into the south-west of the Umbria region, occupying the last section of the Nera Valley near the confluence with the River Velino, and the eastern part of the valley of the Tiber Valley.

The province of Terni is characterized by its slopes encountered along the path of rivers, allowing the exploitation of hydro catchment areas, so as to have led to the creation of several artificial lakes:

* Lake Corbara
* Lake Alviano
* Lake Recentino
* Lake San Liberato
* Lake Arezzo
* Lake Piediluco

== History ==
In the 2nd millennium BC the province was occupied by a population called Umbri, who founded the cities of Amelia, Narnia Nahars, Otricolum and Interamna Nahars. With the development of the Etruscan civilization, their territory was reduced to the valleys of the Black and Velino. One of the most important and richest Etruscan cities in province of Terni was Orvieto and an unidentified place called &quot;Fanum Voltumnae&quot;. For centuries, Umbrian and Etruscan fought hard for the rule of the Tiber Valley, until, in 299 BC when Roman legions began the invasion of Umbria.

The provincial territory was part of the Roman Republic and then the Roman Empire until the latter&#x27;s western part fell in the 5th century AD. In 571 the Lombards, after invading the Po Plain, went down the Apennines and, in 575, founded the Duchy of Spoleto in what is now Umbria and the neighbouring areas; this state remained formally independent until 1250. In 1527 Terni was used a camp of the Landsknecht army that would subsequently take part in the Sack of Rome and fought at Spoleto and Todi, where the League of Cognac troops were located.

Before the late-19th century industrial development, Terni was a small center with some 15,000 inhabitants in 1881. In 1921 it had grown to 40,000 inhabitants. In 1926 it became the seat of a separate province, detached from Perugia, including the countryside around the main centres of Terni and Orvieto.

<text>The province of Perugia () is the larger of the two provinces in the Umbria region of Italy, comprising two-thirds of both the area and population of the region. Its capital is the city of Perugia. The province covered all of Umbria until 1927, when the province of Terni was carved out of its southern third. The province of Perugia has an area of 6,334 km2 covering two-thirds of Umbria, and a total population of about 660,000. There are 59 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province. The province has numerous tourist attractions, especially artistic and historical ones, and is home to the Lake Trasimeno, the largest lake of Central Italy. It is historically the ancestral origin of the Umbri, while later it was a Roman province and then part of the Papal States until the late 19th century.

== History and topology ==

The Etruscans likely founded Perugia in the 6th century BC. The Umbra and Tiber valleys are located in the province. The eastern part of the province is a hilly region while the rest was covered by forests. The province lies in the basin of the river Tiber and its tributaries Chiaseio, Nestore, Naja, and Chiana. The southern regions are less hilly. Silk, corn and grass are some of the most important agricultural products of the province. 

The 1840 version of the &quot;Penny Cyclopaedia&quot; records that Perugia supplied almost half of the butcher&#x27;s meat required in the city of Rome. The large number of cattle was fed on grass growing on the plain areas irrigated by the water of Tiber and its tributaries. After the province of Rome, Viterbo and Spoleto e Rieti the Perugian province was the fourth most important of the Papal States. 

The largest lake in central Italy, Lake Trasimeno is located in the Province of Perugia. The lake has three islands – Polvese, Maggiore and Minore. The lake has a circumference of about 30 miles but is relatively shallow. 
It is fed by springs in the nearby hills.

Perugia was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, as the Province of Umbria. The province at the time was somewhat larger than the current region of Umbria, comprising Rieti to the south (now part of Lazio). It was subdivided into the districts (&quot;circondari&quot;) of Perugia, Foligno, Orvieto, Terni, Rieti and Spoleto. 
In 1921, the municipal council of Terni proposed the separation of the province into the new provinces of Perugia and Terni. 

In 1923, Rieti together with Cittaducale were added to the province of Rome (Lazio). The remaining Province of Umbria was divided into the provinces of Perugia and Terni in 1927.

== Administration ==
The 59 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;) in the province of Perugia are administered by an elected local authority which is responsible for regional planning, managing and addressing municipalities activities, environment, energy, road maintenance etc. In 2007, 25 people died of consequences of drug overdose in the province of Perugia. This was the highest number of deaths recorded due to drug overdose in any Italian province.

== Tourist attractions ==
The province is well known for its medieval palaces, castles and fortresses. A few important tourist destinations of the province are the Roman amphitheatre near Porta Marzia, Cassero di Porta Sant&#x27;Angelo, Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo, Cathedral of San Lorenzo, San Bernardino&#x27;s Pulpit, Piazza IV Novembre, Maggiore Fountain, National Gallery of Umbria, National Museum of Umbrian Archaeology and St Peter&#x27;s bell tower in the city of Perugia; Basilica of Saint Clare, Upper Basilica of St Francis, Temple of Minerva (dates back to 1st century B.C.) and the Basilica of Santa Maria Degli Angeli in Assisi. The first Christian monk Saint Benedict was born in Norcia. 

The town of Gubbio has a Roman theater which dates back to 1st century A.D.. Franciscan Path of Peace which was the path traversed by Saint Francis who left all the property he inherited from his father, connects Assisi with Gubbio. Assisi is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The cultural festival named &quot;Festival dei due Mondi&quot; held in Spoleto; Festival of the Ceri involving a candle procession to the nearby Basilica of San Ubaldo and a crossbow contest &quot;Cross-Bow Palio&quot; in Gubbio also attract large number of tourists. The province is also known for its cuisine which includes black truffles, Easter Pizza, lentils from Castelluccio, and salami and cured meats from Norcia.

<doc id="990246" wikidata="Q10746495" url="?curid=990246" title="Selphie Tilmitt">
<text> is a character from the 1999 role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. She is introduced as a recent transfer student from Trabia Garden to its rival school Balamb Garden, a prestigious military academy for elite mercenaries (known as &quot;SeeDs&quot;) and home to several of the game&#x27;s major characters. She is also the pilot in command of the Ragnarok starship, the primary means of air transport for the player&#x27;s party.

Selphie was the second character drawn by &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; artist Tetsuya Nomura after the game&#x27;s lead protagonist Squall Leonhart. The development team originally intended to program Selphie with some of the game&#x27;s most powerful attacks. A younger version of Selphie appears as a supporting character in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, which is under the direction of Nomura. Other appearances include the mobile game &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot; as well as the &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; fighting game series. Selphie has received a generally positive reception, being noted for her relatable personality as well as her carefree and energetic demeanour, although some critics did not respond well to her characterization as a childlike female character.

==Development==
Selphie Tilmitt, along with most of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; principal cast of characters, was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who would then pass on his finalized character designs to the game&#x27;s scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Nomura came up with Selphie&#x27;s initial design prior to the completion of his work on Squall Leonheart. Selphie is given a flip hairstyle which was popular in the United States during the latter years of the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, an aesthetic design Nomura considered to be improper in real life. When Nomura first designed Selphie, he drew her in overalls, but he realized that none of the characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let another character named Quistis wear pants.

Selphie is depicted in the game as 17 years old and stands at tall. She wields a large pair of nunchaku in battle. In the European version of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, her weapon is renamed as &quot;Shinobou&quot; due to strict censorship laws in the United Kingdom concerning the portrayal of ninja weapons in visual media which were instituted by then-director of the British Board of Film Censors, James Ferman. Selphie&#x27;s Limit Break, a special cinematic attack sequence, is based on a &quot;Slot&quot; machine. If the player manages to line up the reels in a certain way, Selphie can cast a random spell numerous times or unleash some powerful spells which are exclusive to her Limit Break phase, including a magical attack called The End which can defeat almost any enemy in the game. Selphie was intended to have two additional exclusive Limit Break abilities during the game&#x27;s development; though they were shown during a game demo that came bundled with the 1998 action role-playing game &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;, they were never implemented in the final release due to time constraints and cannot be accessed through normal play.

A preadolescent version of Selphie appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, with the inaugural series instalment in 2002 being the character&#x27;s first voiced appearance. She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.

==Appearances==
For Selphie&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, she encounters Squall while running late for class. She asks Squall to show her around as she is a recent transfer from Trabia Garden. During the Dollet exam, Selphie joins Squall&#x27;s team after Seifer abandons them. She successfully graduates alongside Squall and Zell and becomes a SeeD, and the three are assigned to the same team. When Galbadia launches missiles at Trabia Garden, she reacts with outrage and helps destroy the missile base. She is depicted as active and energetic, although slightly clumsy. She participates in many extracurricular activities, such as planning the Garden Festival and running the school&#x27;s online website, the Study Panel.

Throughout the game, she revisits her childhood closeness with Irvine Kinneas, who serves as her copilot on the Ragnarok. A recurring character moment involve Selphie singing a song about trains during the party&#x27;s train journeys.

===Other appearances===
In the 2002 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Selphie appears as a juvenile resident of Destiny Islands and a friend of Sora. She is armed with a jump rope instead of nunchaku. Selphie returns in the 2005 sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as Kairi&#x27;s classmate, but lost all memory of Sora and the island.

Selphie has appeared in several &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise spin-off games, including playable appearances in titles like &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;.

==Promotion and merchandise==
In 2004, action figures of Selphie alongside Squall and Rinoa were distributed in North America by Diamond Comics Distributors.

==Reception==
Selphie has been mostly well-received by the general public. She has been the subject of creative activities engaged by video game enthusiasts, such as cosplay. Magazines have also called her as one of the best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character.

Critical reception for the character has been generally positive, with some critics calling her one of the most appealing and memorable aspects of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. Meagan Marie from &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered Selphie to be one of her &quot;personal favorite&quot; &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; female characters. Dave Smith from &quot;IGN&quot; praised Selphie as one of the game&#x27;s few bright lights, highlighting her hairstyle and her cheerfulness as an effective foil for the angst-filled personalities of its cast. Jeremy Parish from &quot;USGamer&quot; called Selphie his favorite role-playing game character, going as far as calling her the first video game character he could relate to as a realistic human being, setting her apart from other game characters given the sharp contrast between her conduct and the rest of her team. Parish made the claim that she &quot;broke the mold for RPG characters as either grim heroes or blank slates or a combination of the two&quot;. Matt Sainsbury from &quot;Digitally Downloaded&quot; felt that Selphie stood out to him as a physically attractive character, in spite of the graphical limitations of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; as a product of its time, because of her &quot;cute, quirky hairstyle&quot; and her attractive mini-dress outfit. David Lozada from &quot;GameRevolution&quot; considered Selphie&#x27;s character arc, which sees her dealing with insecurity and childhood trauma in her own way, to be noteworthy because he found that &quot;few other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games feature female character arcs that are as remarkable&quot; as her growth into a confident, strong woman by the game&#x27;s ending. &quot;WomenGamers&quot; gave a positive assessment of the character, noting that while others may underestimate Selphie&#x27;s intellect due to her perky and energetic nature, she demonstrates that she is competent when a problematic situation arises and appears to be as smart as her prodigious comrade Quistis. Selphie received high scores from &quot;WomenGamers&quot; for the stance and marketing effort behind her, with praise for the lack of sexualization surrounding the character&#x27;s appearances in promotional material for &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; and her balanced portrayal as a clumsy yet capable fighter.

Several critics note that elements of Selphie&#x27;s behavior and personality resemble that of other female characters within the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise and that she represented a common recurring character archetype used throughout related media. Commentary on this aspect of her character drew both positive and negative responses. Parish argued that Selphie never seemed &quot;overbearing or forced&quot; to him, unlike many other female characters in the series who also occupy the same &quot;genki girl&quot; niche. Sainsbury praised Selphie as the &quot;original somewhat ditzy, super perky, brighten-up-your-day background character&quot; archetype within the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, which is continued by characters who appear in subsequent instalments like Rikku and Vanille. Conversely, Andy Kelly from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; recognized Selphie as the light-hearted &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; character archetype &quot;who gets hit extra hard when something tragic inevitably happens&quot;, but found her to be &quot;almost sickeningly friendly and good-natured&quot;, and her &quot;bouncy and eager to please tendencies&quot; unendearing.

===Analysis===
Selphie&#x27;s role as a child figure was discussed by Mark Filipowich in an essay published in the 2018 book &quot;Queerness in Play&quot;. He observed that a lithe fighter archetype like Selphie is characterized as much by her offensive versatility as her helplessness. In terms of gender roles, Filipowich suggested that there is a looser gender script for a childlike character, unlike the maiden character archetype who may be constrained to a nurturing healer role or supporting the rest of the party with rogue-style tactics. Filipowich suggested that the child character archetype represents potential as opposed to limitation, and that female variants of the archetype seemingly have space to undergo character development independently of male party members. Alexa Ray Corriea noted that Selphie&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, where she is depicted as an actual child, fall into the same trope as other female characters present in its male-dominated setting, as none of them make enough of a significant impact within its narrative. Josh Tolentino from &quot;Destructoid&quot; used Selphie and her fascination with trains as a point of reference about linear game design in an analysis of the mechanics and systems typical of Japanese role-playing games.

<doc id="990247" wikidata="Q6338449" url="?curid=990247" title="KT66">
<text>KT66 is the designator for a beam power tube introduced by Marconi-Osram Valve Co. Ltd. (M-OV) of Britain in 1937 and marketed for application as a power amplifier for audio frequencies and driver for radio frequencies.
The KT66 is a beam tetrode that utilizes partially collimated electron beams to form a low potential space charge region between the anode and screen grid to return anode secondary emission electrons to the anode and offers significant performance improvements over comparable power pentodes. In the 21st century, the KT66 is manufactured and used in some high fidelity audio amplifiers and musical instrument amplifiers.

== Overview ==
Although the RCA 6L6 of 1936 (the result of a license agreement between RCA and EMI) was the first successful beam power tube on the market, the KT66 of 1937 became almost equally famous, at least in Europe.

Because the beam tetrode design eliminated the &quot;tetrode kink&quot; in the lower parts of the tetrode&#x27;s voltage-current characteristic curves, M-OV marketed this tube family as the &quot;KT&quot; series, standing for &quot;kinkless tetrode&quot;.

The KT66 was one of the &quot;International series&quot; introduced in 1937. This series utilized the &quot;American Octal&quot; base and had characteristics equivalent to tubes by U.S. manufacturers. A number of different KT tubes were later marketed by M-OV. Some, but not all, were versions of existing American beam tetrode tubes or European power pentodes, such as the KT66 (6L6GC similar), KT77 (EL34 and 6CA7 similar), KT88 (6550), and KT63 (6F6, pentode but almost identical characteristics).

The KT66 was very popular in British radios and audio amplifiers. It was the standard output tube in the classic Quad II (1952, a version of which is still being manufactured today) and in the LEAK Type 15 (1945) and TL/12 (1948), both among the earliest British hi-fi amplifiers. Because of their excellent electrical characteristics and overload tolerance, KT66s are preferred by some guitar players for use in guitar amps in place of 6L6GC. However, the plate dissipation of the 6L6GC, at 30W, exceeds the KT66&#x27;s 25W, and adjustment of the amplifier&#x27;s bias is necessary.

M-OV ceased glass vacuum tube manufacturing in 1988; their old audio tube types became valuable collectibles. In 2004 original M-OV KT66 tubes (bearing the official &quot;Genalex&quot; marketing brand that M-OV used outside the UK), unused in original carton, sold for US$250. KT66 tubes continued to be manufactured at EkspoPUL in Saratov, Russia (Genalex Gold Lion brand), JJ Electronic in Slovakia, and by Hengyang Electronics at former Guiguang factory in Foshan city, southern China.

Some modern Russian manufacture Sovtek KT66 tubes are actually 6L6GC tubes in a KT66 style bottle. While these tubes have the same pinout and minimum tolerances required of a KT66 tube, they do not have the performance characteristics of a true kinkless tetrode KT66 tube.

By contrast the very latest Russian manufactured tubes (2012) not only carry the same internal electrode structure as the original KT66 (they now look the same) they also have the same rugged electrical characteristics and can withstand a high voltage on grid 2 comparable to the anode voltage rating, allowing greater power output afforded by higher voltage capability when run in ultralinear connection.

<text>Coastal Andhra, also known as Kosta Andhra (IAST: Kōstā Āndhra), is a geographic region in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, comprising the coastal districts of the state between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, from the northern border with Orissa to Rayalaseema in the south. It includes major cities such as Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada as well as the state capital Amaravati and is recognized for its fertile lands, rich cultural heritage, and economic importance. Coastal Andhra plays a significant role in the state&#x27;s agricultural output, particularly in rice and tobacco production, supported by abundant water resources from the Godavari, Krishna, and Penna rivers.

While Coastal Andhra generally includes the districts along the Bay of Bengal, the Uttarandhra (Northern Andhra) area is sometimes regarded as distinct due to its unique cultural and historical background. Coastal Andhra shares borders with the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh and the state of Telangana. Covering an area of , Coastal Andhra accounts for 58% of Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s total area and, as per the 2011 Census of India, hosts a population of over 3.4 crore, constituting 69.20% of the state’s population. Coastal Andhra was formerly part of the Madras State until 1953 and then became part of Andhra State from 1953 to 1956.

Historically, Coastal Andhra has been a centre of trade and culture, featuring strong traditions in literature, music, and dance. The region contributed actively to the Indian independence movement and continues to impact the state’s economy through industries such as information technology, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals. It is also home to major ports in Visakhapatnam and Kakinada, enhancing its status as a critical industrial and trading hub. Proximity to the Bay of Bengal, however, makes the region susceptible to tropical cyclones and coastal erosion, prompting investments in disaster preparedness and coastal management initiatives.

== History ==
The region of Andhra emerged as a prominent political power during the Maurya Empire. Historical accounts by Greek ambassador Megasthenes () reference Andhra as a flourishing region under the Satavahanas before the Common Era. The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan Plateau from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE. It had trade relations with the Roman Empire. The Satavahanas made Dhanyakataka-Amaravathi their capital. According to historian Stanley Wolpert, it might have been the most prosperous city in India in 2nd century CE.

Coastal Andhra was subsequently governed by the Eastern Chalukya dynasty between the 7th and 12th centuries CE, followed by successive rule under the Chola, Kakatiya, and Vijayanagara empires. According to 11th-century inscriptions, the geographical boundaries of Coastal Andhra extended from the Mahendragiri mountains in the northeastern border near Orissa’s Gajapati district, to the Kalahasti Temple in Tirupati district, and the Srisailam Temple in Nandyal district.

In the mid-18th century, the Gajapati and Ganjam districts, which were part of Coastal Andhra, were granted to the French East India Company in 1752 but were later transferred to British control. Nellore, including areas reaching up to Ongole Taluk, came under British administration after being acquired from the Nawab of Arcot. Additionally, certain parts of present-day Nellore and Chittoor were managed by the Venkatagiri Rajas until 1802, when the British entered into an arrangement with the Raja of Venkatagiri, consolidating their control over these territories.

The Coastal Andhra districts, historically known as the Northern Circars, along with the Rayalaseema region, were ceded by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the British colonial administration, becoming part of the Madras Presidency under British rule.

<text>Brie de Meaux is a French brie cheese of the Brie region and a designated AOC product since 1980. Its name comes from the town of Meaux in the Brie region. As of 2003, 6,774 tonnes (-13.4% since 1998) were produced annually.

==Description==
Brie de Meaux is made from cow&#x27;s milk, with an average weight of for a diameter of . It has a soft, delicate white rind. The interior of the cheese is straw-yellow, creamy and soft.

==History==
A modern legend identifies as Brie de Meaux a certain cheese dating to the seventh century, &quot;rich and creamy&quot;, with an edible white rind that in the 774 AD Frankish Emperor Charlemagne first tasted in the company of a bishop and approved, requiring two cartloads to be sent to Aachen annually; the site, not mentioned in the anecdotal but unreliable ninth-century life of Charlemagne, &quot;De Carolo Magno&quot; by Notker the Stammerer, has become associated with the monastery traditionally founded by Rado in Reuil-en-Brie.

This cheese was named the &quot;king of cheeses&quot; in 1815 by Talleyrand at the Congress of Vienna.

==Manufacturing==

The production territory of Brie de Meaux is limited to the departments of Seine-et-Marne, Loiret, Meuse, Aube, Marne, Haute-Marne and the Yonne. There is, however, no production close to Meaux, and there is little celebration of the cheese in the town.

Brie de Meaux is made with raw cow&#x27;s milk. It takes about of milk to make a large cheese. The fermented milk is placed in a tank for 16 hours, then put in bowl for curding which lasts one hour. It is then cut into small cubes with a slice-curd. Finally, it is molded by hand into thin layers with a brie shovel. The temperature in the room where casting is made must be increased to for four hours to evacuate the whey, then at for six hours and finally at . It is then drained on mats made of reeds. The next day, the cheese is then salted and they will then remain in the curing room for two days. Then, the cheeses are placed in a room at in which they will begin to be refined and the characteristic white rind will begin to appear. After one week, the cheese will be placed in another refrigerator at . It must wait 3 weeks minimum, typically 6 to 8 weeks to reach full maturity. Throughout the ripening period, cheeses are routinely turned by hand. The time of manufacture of Brie de Meaux is two months.

<text>Angoche Island is a small island in the district of same name in Mozambique. The island lies at the mouth of the Mluli River; the river enters the sea at the southernmost point of a large bay which contains a number of low, marshy islands. One of these islands was home to the ancient Islamic settlement of Angoche, and the island is thus known as Angoche Island. A coastal island, its main source of income was the illegal shipment of enslaved people, which enriched the aristocratic classes of the Nyapakho clan. It was not taken by the Portuguese until 1913, thanks to the brave resistance of the sultan, particularly Ibrahim Iussuf. His nephew, who was the commander-in-chief of a 30,000 men army took over power and opposed with tenacity the Portuguese until 1890. By then, Farlah, the last sultan, resumed the war against the Portuguese until he was captured in a battle in 1910 and deported to East Timor where he died in prison. The small island is subject to cyclones; Cyclone Huda in particular is remembered, and so permanent habitation has not been possible. Angoche is the largest producer of cashew and shrimps in Mozambique. 

== History ==
Angoche was first mentioned by a Portuguese document in 1506. The former British consul, Lyons McLeod, published a brief history of the Angoche sultanate in 1860, followed by a more comprehensive account by Eduardo do Couto Lupi in his 1907 study, &quot;Angoche&quot;. According to Lupi, the islands of Angoche, Mocambique, and Quelimane were founded by a group of refugees from Kilwa shortly before the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. The two leaders of the refugees, Mussa and Hassani, who settled at Mocambique and Quelimane respectively, found established Muslim communities in each place. Hassani died while on a visit to Mocambique and was buried on Mafamale Island (also off the mouth of the Angoche River). After Mussa visited the grave, he decided that Angoche was a more favourable locality than Queliman and installed Xosa, Hassani&#x27;s son, as sultan of Angoche. (See Angoche Sultanate for more information.) The tomb of Sultan Hassani remained a centre of pilgrimage until at least the 19th century.

Other sources, such as the account of Duarte Barbosa in 1518, confirm that the language and customs of Angoche were the same as those of Mocambique. Duarte de Lemos noted the close trade relationships that still survived in 1508 between Angoche and Mocambique.

<doc id="990266" wikidata="Q1277590" url="?curid=990266" title="Antun Branko Šimić">
<text>Antun Branko Šimić (18 November 1898 – 2 May 1925) was a Bosnian and Herzegovinian and Croatian expressionist poet, considered to be one of the most important poets of Croatian literature of the 20th century.

==Life==
He was born to a Croat family from Drinovci near Grude on 18 November 1898, in the family of Vida and Martin Šimić. He attended primary school in his native village, and then the first three forms of the Franciscan classical grammar school in Široki Brijeg. He decided to change school in the fourth form and went to Mostar and afterwards to Vinkovci (Gymnasium Vinkovci). His unruly spirit made him change his surroundings again and so he continued his education in Zagreb, in the upper town grammar school.

In 1917, he started the journal for art and culture, &quot;Vijavica&quot; (Whirlwind), which forced him to leave school. This is when he lost his parents&#x27; support and it also meant a hard life overpowered by many illnesses. After four issues of &quot;Vijavica&quot;, taking the example of German journal &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, he also launched another journal, &quot;Juriš&quot; (Attack), which likewise had a short life of three issues only. He went on writing poems, literary and art critiques and also translating. At the Faculty of Philosophy he met Tatjana Marinić to whom he dedicated his one and only collection, &quot;Preobraženja&quot; (&quot;Metamorphoses&quot;) in 1920.

Between 1918 and 1919, he immersed himself into writing poems whilst staying in a hamlet of Drinovci, Dubrava Majići, in a cottage where his mother grew up. Some of his first expressionist works were created here, most notably &quot;Ja pjevam&quot; (I Sing), &quot;Povratak&quot; (The Return) and &quot;Ljubav&quot; (Love).

His modest income and dedication to his literary work left a mark on his health, so he went back to Drinovci in December 1923 and made up with his father. When he returned to Zagreb in spring 1924 he launched his third journal, &quot;Književnik&quot; (Writer). Some time in 1924, he contracted tuberculosis, for which he received treatment later that year in a hospital in Dubrovnik, and spent time recuperating in a sanatorium in Cavtat. However, after his return to Zagreb in February 1925, his condition rapidly worsened. He died on 2 May 1925 in a hospital in Zagreb and was buried in Mirogoj Cemetery.

==Works==

Šimić did not write a large literary opus during his lifetime. However, some of his poems could be called anthological, like &quot;Pjesnici&quot; (Poets), &quot;Veče i ja&quot; (The Evening and I), &quot;Opomena&quot; (Warning), &quot;Ručak siromaha&quot; (The Poor Man&#x27;s Dinner), &quot;Žene pred uredima&quot; (Women in Front of Offices), &quot;Smrt i ja&quot; (Death and I), &quot;Pjesma jednom brijegu&quot; (Poem to a Mountain), &quot;Smrt&quot; (Death), and some others. After writing under the influence of Matoš, Kranjčević, Vidrić and Domjanić, he bore down on the traditionalists and started favouring an unrestrained expression and expressionist spirit. In his collection &quot;Preobraženja&quot; (Metamorphoses), using a free verse, he wrote tersely, rhythmically, gnomically and logically.

He would also sometimes recourse to the decasyllabic line and the folk lament. His topics are the man, pain, poverty, stars, Herzegovina, the poor, life and death (&quot;death is something quite human&quot;). When he turns to the man he warns him: Be careful not to go, small as thou are, under the stars, man, (from the poem Warning). When he writes about the mystery and perseverance, he says: We watch each other silently. Mountain and man. I&#x27;ll never know where our different meanings meet- (Poem to a mountain).

In his journals, Šimić published his essays that defended the principles of expressionism, which influenced his later poetry. In particular, his views were based on the tenets of German Expressionism.

The image of A.B. Šimić can be seen on Federation of BiH issue of the 20 km banknote.

<text>Telangana (, ALA-LC: ; ) is a state in India situated in the south-central part of the Indian subcontinent on the high Deccan Plateau. It is the eleventh largest state and the twelfth most populated state in India according to the 2011 census. On 2 June 2014, the area was separated from the northwestern part of United Andhra Pradesh as the newly formed state of Telangana, with Hyderabad as its capital. Telugu, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and the primary official language of the state while Urdu is the second official language. 

The economy of Telangana is the ninth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of and has a GSDP per capita of for the financial year 2024–25. Telangana scored 0.705 on the Human Development Index during 2017–2018.

The state has emerged as a major focal point for IT software companies, industry and the services sector. The state is also the main administrative center of many Indian defence aerospace and research labs including Bharat Dynamics Limited, Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory, Defence Research and Development Organisation and Defence Research and Development Laboratory.


== Etymology ==
One popular etymology derives the word &quot;Telangana&quot; from &quot;Trilinga desha&quot; (&quot;land of three lingas&quot;), a region named after 3 important Shaivite shrines present in it: Kaleshwaram (present day Telangana), Srisailam and Draksharama (present day Andhra Pradesh).

According to Jayadheer Tirumala Rao, a scholar of history, the name Telangana is of Gondi origin. Rao asserts that it is derived from &quot;Telangadh&quot;, which means &quot;south&quot; in Gondi and has been referred in &quot;Gond script dating back to about 2000 years&quot;.

One of the earliest uses of a word similar to Telangana can also be seen in a name of Malik Maqbul Tilangani (14th century CE), who was called the &quot;Tilangani&quot;, which implies that he was from Telangana. He was the commander of the Warangal Fort (&quot;Kataka Pāludu&quot;) and later &quot;Wazir&quot;— Minister under Firuz Shah Tughlaq.

A 16th-century travel writer, Firishta, recorded in his book:
During the just reign of Ibrahim Kootb Shah, &quot;Tulingana&quot;, like Egypt, became the mart of the whole world. Merchants from Toorkistan, Arabia, and Persia resorted to it; and they met with such encouragement that they found in it inducements to return frequently. The greatest luxuries from foreign parts daily abounded at the king&#x27;s hospitable board.

The word &quot;Telinga&quot; changed over time to &quot;Telangana&quot; and the name &quot;Telangana&quot; was designated to distinguish the predominantly Telugu-speaking region of the erstwhile Hyderabad State from its predominantly Marathi-speaking one, Marathwada. It is also called &quot;The land of Telugu people&quot;. After Asaf Jahi&#x27;s ceded the Seemandhra region to the British, the rest of the Telugu region retained the name Telangana and the other parts were called Madras Presidency&#x27;s Circars and Ceded.

== History ==
Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Telangana region was part of multiple Indian empires; such as the Mauryans, Satavahanas, Vishnukundinas, Chalukyas, Cholas, Rashtrakutas, Kakatiyas, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate and Golconda Sultanate. During the 17th-19th centuries, the region was ruled by the Mughals and Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1823, the Nizams ceded Northern Circars—(Coastal Andhra) and Ceded Districts—(Rayalseema) to British India under a subsidiary alliance which reduced it to that of a landlocked princely state bounded on all sides by British India.

Following the Indian Independence in 1947 the Hyderabad state joined the Union of India in 1948 after a police action. In 1956, the Hyderabad State was dissolved and its Telugu-speaking region Telangana was merged with the Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh. A peasant-driven movement began to advocate for separation from Andhra Pradesh starting in the early 1950s, and continued until Telangana was granted statehood on 2 June 2014.

The historic city Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre, and until the end of the 19th century the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name Golconda Diamonds became synonymous with Golconda itself.

=== Early history ===

From 230 BCE to 220 CE, the Satavahana dynasty became the dominant power in this area. It originated from the lands between the Godavari and Krishna rivers and was based at Amaravathi and Dharanikota. After the decline of the Satavahanas, various dynasties, such as the Vakataka, Vishnukundina, Chalukya, Rashtrakuta and Western Chalukya, ruled the area.

=== Medieval period ===


The Telangana area experienced its golden age during the reign of the Kakatiya dynasty, which ruled most parts of the present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from 1083 to 1323 CE. Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra II were prominent rulers from the Kakatiya dynasty. The dynasty weakened with the attack of Malik Kafur in 1309 and was dissolved after the defeat of Prataparudra by the forces of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323.
The area came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, followed by the Bahmani Sultanate. Quli Qutb Mulk, a governor of Golconda, revolted against the Bahmani Sultanate and established the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1518. On 21 September 1687, the Golconda Sultanate came under the rule of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb after a year-long siege of the Golconda fort.

During the early seventeenth century a strong cotton-weaving industry existed in Telangana. Large quantities of cotton were produced for domestic and exports consumption. High quality plain and patterned cloth made of muslin and calico was produced.

In 1712, Qamar-ud-din Khan was appointed by emperor Farrukhsiyar as the viceroy of Deccan with the title &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; (meaning &quot;Administrator of the Realm&quot;). He was later recalled to Delhi, with Mubariz Khan appointed as the viceroy. In 1724, Qamar-ud-din Khan defeated Mubariz Khan to reclaim the &quot;Deccan suba,&quot; establishing it as an autonomous province of the Mughal empire. He took the name &quot;Asif Jah&quot;, starting what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. He named the area Hyderabad Deccan. Subsequent rulers retained the title &quot;Nizam ul-Mulk&quot; and were called Asif Jahi Nizams or nizams of Hyderabad. Hyderabad Nizams remained the tributary of marathas after suffering series of defeats paying annual chauth in return for retaining their domain. The Medak and Warangal divisions of Telangana were part of their realm.
When Asif Jah I died in 1748, there was political unrest due to contention for the throne among his sons, who were aided by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. In 1769, Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. The Nizam Nasir-ud-dawlah, Asaf Jah IV signed the subsidiary alliance with the British in 1799 and lost its control over the state&#x27;s defence and foreign affairs. 

All of the Telugu speaking regions of modern Telangana, Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema were all under the rule of Asaf Jahi I. However, after the second monarch, Nizam Ali Khan (1762-1803), signed the Treaty of Subsidiary Alliance with the British in 1798, the rulers were soon under financial duress as the state had to pay the British East India Company lakhs of rupees a year to maintain the foreign troops.

The Nizam’s government kept borrowing money from Palmer and Company in the first half of the 19th century, which it could not pay back. Instead, the EIC paid-off the bank, and in return took away the present day Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions away from the Nizams, which were since then referred to as Circars (which means the region sold to the British lords) and Ceded, respectively. 

Hyderabad State became a princely state among the presidencies and provinces of British India.

In 1787, heavy flooding killed over 20,000 causing a plague which killed about 10,656 people in Telangana.

=== Modern period ===
When India became independent from the British Empire in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad did not want to merge with the Indian Union and wanted to remain independent. The Government of India annexed Hyderabad State on 17 September 1948 after a military operation called Operation Polo. It appointed a civil servant, M. K. Vellodi, as first chief minister of Hyderabad State on 26 January 1950. He administered the state with the help of English-educated bureaucrats from the Madras and Bombay states, who were familiar with British systems of administration unlike the bureaucrats of Hyderabad State who used a completely different administrative system. The official language of the state was switched from Urdu to English.

In 1952, Dr. Burgula Ramakrishna Rao was elected chief minister of the Hyderabad State in its first democratic election. During this time, there were violent agitations by some Telanganites to send the Madras state bureaucrats back and implement a rule by the natives (&quot;mulkis&quot;) of Hyderabad (Syed Alam Sharjil) was elected chief minister of Hyderabad after (Dr. Burgula Ramakrishana Rao) for one year after he resigned from the post.
The Telangana Rebellion was a peasant revolt supported by the communists. It originated in the Telangana regions of the Hyderabad State between 1946 and 1951, led by the Communist Party of India (CPI).

The revolt began in the Nalgonda district against the feudal lords of Reddy and Velama castes. It quickly spread to the Warangal and Bidar districts. Peasant farmers and labourers revolted against the local feudal landlords (&quot;jagirdars&quot; and &quot;deshmukhs&quot;) and later against the Nizam Osman Ali Khan. The violent phase of the movement ended after the government of India&#x27;s Operation Polo. Starting in 1951, the CPI shifted to a more moderate strategy of seeking to bring communism to India within the framework of Indian democracy.

In December 1953, the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC) was appointed to form states on a linguistic basis. An agreement was reached between Telangana leaders and Andhra leaders on 20 February 1956 to merge Telangana and Andhra with promises to safeguard Telangana&#x27;s interests. After reorganisation in 1956, the region of Telangana was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh.

Following this Gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, the central government established the unified state of Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956. G.O 553 of 1959 from the united Andhra Pradesh state moved two revenue divisions of Bhadrachalam from East Godavari and Aswaraopeta from West Godavari to Khammam for administrative convenience.
There had been several movements to revoke the merger of Telangana and Andhra, major ones occurring in 1969, 1972, and 2009. The movement for a new state of Telangana gained momentum in the 21st century by an initiative of Kalvakuntla Chandrashekhar Rao from Bharat Rashtra Samithi later joined by the Telangana Political Joint Action Committee (TJAC), including political leadership representing the Telangana area. On 9 December 2009 the government of India announced the process of formation of the Telangana state. Violent protests led by people in the Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema regions occurred immediately after the announcement, and the decision was put on hold on 23 December 2009.

The movement continued in Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana. There were hundreds of claimed suicides, strikes, protests and disturbances to public life demanding separate statehood.
On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recommend the formation of a separate Telangana state. After various stages the bill was placed in the Parliament of India in February 2014. In February 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state, comprising ten districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh. The bill received the assent of the president and was published in the Gazette on 1 March 2014.

The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014. Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected as the first chief minister of Telangana, following elections in which the Bharat Rashtra Samithi party secured a majority. Hyderabad would remain as the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for a period. Within the decade, Hyderabad would become the capital of the state of Telangana, and a new capital was selected for Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh picked Amaravati as its capital and relocated its secretariat in 2016 and its legislature in 2017.

== Geography ==
Telangana is situated on the Deccan Plateau, in the central stretch of the eastern seaboard of the Indian Peninsula. It covers . The region is drained by two major rivers, with about 79% of the Godavari River catchment area and about 69% of the Krishna River catchment area, but most of the land is arid. Telangana is also drained by several minor rivers such as the Bhima, the Maner, the Manjira, the Musi, and the Tungabhadra.

The annual rainfall is between 900 and 1500mm in northern Telangana and 700 to 900mm in southern Telangana, from the southwest monsoons. Telangana contains various soil types, some of which are red sandy loams (Chalaka), Red loamy sands (Dubba), lateritic soils, salt-affected soils, alluvial soils, shallow to medium black soils and very deep black cotton soils. These soil types allow the planting of a variety of fruits and vegetable crops such as mangoes, oranges, coconut, sugarcane, paddy, banana and flower crops.

=== Climate ===
Telangana is a semi-arid area and has a predominantly hot and dry climate. Summers start in March, and peak in mid-April with average high temperatures in the range. The monsoon arrives in June and lasts until Late-September with about 755 mm (29.7 inches) of precipitation. A dry, mild winter starts in late November and lasts until early February with little humidity and average temperatures in the range.

==== Ecology ====
The Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregion covers much of the state, including Hyderabad. The characteristic vegetation is woodlands of &quot;Hardwickia binata&quot; and &quot;Albizia amara&quot;. Over 80% of the original forest cover has been cleared for agriculture, timber harvesting, or cattle grazing, but large blocks of forest can be found in Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve and elsewhere. The more humid Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests cover the Eastern Ghats in the eastern part of the state.

==== National parks and sanctuaries ====
Telangana has three National Parks: Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park in Hyderabad district, and Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park and Mrugavani National Park in Ranga Reddy district.
Wildlife Sanctuaries in Telangana include Eturunagaram Wildlife Sanctuary and Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary in Warangal District, Kawal Tiger Reserve and Pranahita Wildlife Sanctuary in Adilabad district, Kinnerasani Wildlife Sanctuary in Khammam district, Manjira Wildlife Sanctuary in Medak district, Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve in Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar districts, Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary in Medak and Nizamabad districts, Shivaram Wildlife Sanctuary in Karimnagar district.

Sacred groves are small areas of forest preserved by local people. Sacred groves provide sanctuary to the local flora and fauna. Some are included within other protected areas, like Kadalivanam in Nagarjunsagar–Srisailam Tiger Reserve, but most stand alone. There are 65 sacred groves in Telangana—two in Adilabad district, thirteen in Hyderabad district, four in Karimnagar district, four in Khammam district, nine in Mahbubnagar district, four in Medak district, nine in Nalgonda district, ten in Ranga Reddy district, and three in Warangal district.

== Demographics ==
=== Language ===


Telugu, one of the classical languages of India, is the official language of Telangana and Urdu is the second official language of the state. About 75% of the population of Telangana speak Telugu and 12% speak Urdu. Before 1948, Urdu was the official language of Hyderabad State, and due to a lack of Telugu-language educational institutions, Urdu was the language of the educated elite of Telangana. After 1948, once Hyderabad State joined the new Republic of India, Telugu became the language of government, and as Telugu was introduced as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges, the use of Urdu among non-Hyderabadi Muslims decreased. Both Telugu and Urdu are used in services across the state, such as the Telangana Legislature website, with Telugu and Urdu versions of the website available, as well as the Hyderabad metro, wherein both languages are used on station names and signs along with English and Hindi. The Urdu spoken in Telangana is called Hyderabadi Urdu, which in itself is a dialect of the larger Dakhini Urdu dialects of South India. Although the language is spoken by most Hyderabadi Muslims, the language in a literary context has long been lost, and standard Urdu is used. Hindi is spoken mainly in Hyderabad, as well as some other urban areas like Warangal. Lambadi, a language related to Rajasthani dialects, is used across the state. Marathi is predominant in regions bordering Maharashtra, especially in the old Adilabad district, while Kannada is spoken by significant minorities along some parts of the Karnataka border. The old Adilabad district has a large number of speakers of tribal languages such as Gondi and Kolami, while Koya is a language spoken by significant numbers in Bhadradi Kothagudem district and along the Chhattisgarh border.

Telangana ranked eighth in the Fiscal Health Index (FHI) 2025, with a score of 43.6.

=== Religion and Culture ===
According to the 2011 census, Hindus form 85.1% of the State&#x27;s population. Muslims form 12.7% and Christians form 1.3%.

Religious edifices like the Lakshmi Narasimha Temple in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Makkah Masjid in Hyderabad, the ancient Bhadrakali Temple and Govinda Rajula Gutta in Warangal, Alampur Jogulamba Temple in Jogulamba Gadwal district and Medak Cathedral, Kondagattu Anjaneya Swamy Temple, Kothakonda Veerabhadra Swamy Temple, Lord Shiva temple in Vemulawada of Rajanna-Sircilla district are several of its most famous places of worship. Buddhism also flourished in the region and many Aramams can be found.

Hyderabadi cuisine and Kakatiya architecture both from Telangana, are on the list of creativity UNESCO creative city of gastronomy and UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The cultural centers of Telangana, Hyderabad and Warangal, are noted for their wealth and renowned historical structures – Ramappa Temple (UNESCO World Heritage Site), Charminar, Qutb Shahi Tombs, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace, Warangal Fort, Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, Thousand Pillar Temple and the Bhongir Fort.

=== Literacy ===
According to the 2011 census, Telangana&#x27;s literacy rate is 66.46%. Male literacy and female literacy are 74.95% and 57.92%, respectively. Hyderabad district has the highest literacy rate with 80.96% and Mahabubnagar district has the lowest with 56.06%.

In a 2019 report, the &quot;Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education in India&quot;, by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Telangana has a literacy rate of 72.8% which is the fourth lowest among large states. It also has the second lowest literacy rate among rural women at 53.7%. 37.1% of the population aged 3–35 years received free education at pre-primary and higher levels in Telangana.

== Administrative divisions ==
The state is divided into 33 districts. The latest two new districts, Mulugu and Narayanpet, were formed on 17 February 2019. The districts are divided into 70 revenue divisions which are further divided into 584 mandals. There are a total of 10,909 revenue villages and 12,769 gram panchayats in the state.

The districts in the state are:
There are a total of 12 cities in the state. Hyderabad is the biggest city in the state and 4th largest city in India. There are 13 municipal corporations and 132 municipalities in the state.

== Government and politics ==

Telangana is governed by a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are three branches of government.

# Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.
# The legislature, the Telangana Legislative Assembly and the Telangana Legislative Council, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the speaker or the deputy speaker in the speaker&#x27;s absence. The Assembly is bicameral with 119 Members of the Legislative Assembly and 40 Member of the Legislative Council. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The Legislative Council is a permanent body with one-third of members retiring every two years.
# The judiciary is composed of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad and a system of lower courts.

Auxiliary authorities known as &quot;panchayats&quot;, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes seats to Lok Sabha.

The main political parties in the regional politics are the Bharat Rashtra Samithi, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Bharatiya Janata Party and Indian National Congress. Following the Telangana Legislative Assembly Election in 2014, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi under Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected to power.

== Economy ==

The economy of Telangana is mainly driven by agriculture. Two important rivers of
India, the Godavari and Krishna, flow through the state,
providing irrigation. Farmers in Telangana mainly depend on rain-fed water sources for irrigation. Rice is the major food crop. Other important crops are cotton, sugar cane, mango, and tobacco. Recently, crops used for vegetable oil production such as sunflower and peanuts have gained favour. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world&#x27;s highest masonry dam.

The state has also started to focus on the fields of information technology and biotechnology. Telangana is one of top IT-exporting states of India. There are 68 Special Economic Zones in the state.

Telangana is a mineral-rich state, with coal reserves at Singareni Collieries Company.

=== Agriculture ===

Rice is the major food crop and staple food of the state. Other important crops are maize, tobacco, mango, cotton and sugar cane. Agriculture has been the chief source of income for the state&#x27;s economy. The Godavari and Krishna rivers flow through the state, providing irrigation. Apart from major rivers, there are small rivers like Tunga Bhadra, Bima, Dindi, Kinnerasani, Manjeera, Manair, Penganga, Pranahitha, peddavagu and Taliperu. There are many multi-state irrigation projects in development, including Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects and Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world&#x27;s highest masonry dam.

Agri Export Zones for the following produce have been proposed for the following locations:
* Gherkins: Mahabubnagar, Rangareddy, Medak, Karimnagar, Warangal
* Mangoes and grapes: Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medak, Mahabubnagar

In 2019, environmental anthropologist Andrew Flachs raised concerns regarding the financial and social pressures experienced by small cotton farmers in Telangana after conducting ethnographic research in the area. The GM (genetically modified) seeds he focused on were introduced to combat pests and low yields. Within 10 years, GM cottonseeds, which are solely bred by private breeders, were able to capture more than 90% of the Indian market, which was formerly a public market. The privatisation of seed brands in formerly public markets has been accompanied by pesticides, fertilisers, consultations, and herbicides which are needed to manage the new monocultures. He found that this introduction, however, negatively impacted farmers’ ecological knowledge about seed choices and cotton-plant management.

Flachs surveyed farming households about their experiences with GM hybrid cottonseeds from 2012 to 2016. His research initially focused on the agricultural decision-making process among Telangana cotton farmers in the wake of genetically modified seed market expansion, then later on the concept of &quot;manci digubadi&quot; as a script. &quot;Manci digubadi&quot; means &quot;good yields,&quot; with a more extended phrasing being &quot;&quot;manci digubadi annakunthunnanu&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;I’m hoping for good yields.&quot; The concept of &quot;manci digubadi,&quot; as described by Flachs, posits that seed choice should be made based on whether or not it has &quot;good yields,&quot;  which is dependent solely on what the individual believes is &quot;good.&quot; Flachs further argues that this script is used in the absence of reliable experiential knowledge in the face of agricultural development and GMOs. This is because, in the pursuit of a good yield, cotton farmers learn little about the seeds they use before they switch to the next promising new brands, some of which have been smuggled in or bought on the black market. Marketing, the constant influx of new options, and the fear of missing out on popular seeds also contribute to the high turnover. This high turnover and the resulting lack of experiential knowledge have resulted in cotton farmers unwittingly planting the same type of seed multiple times because they are under different brand names. In contrast to this, farmers adopt and abandon seeds from public-sector-bred crops like rice and heirloom vegetables more slowly so they can rely more on experiential knowledge to make decisions.

Telangana cotton farmers are at risk for debt and suicide caused by agricultural pressures such as unreliable credit, pest problems, and agricultural management uncertainty. Flachs argues that seed choices and the rationalisation behind the choice are central to the agricultural political economy, as seed choice is &quot;the first decision that cotton farmers make and one that they cannot take back.&quot; Flachs argues that cotton seed choices are driven less by economic rationalism and more by an aspiration to overcome generational poverty and historical marginalisation. Flachs found evidence in his work suggesting that many farmers&#x27; seed choices are influenced by the choices of their neighbours or more wealthy landowners. As an example of &quot;manci digubadi&quot; being used in place of experiential knowledge, Flachs gives the story of a farmer who had planted the Mahyco company&#x27;s Neeraja cottonseed for nine years abandoned that seed in favour of Kaveri&#x27;s Jaadoo seed after hearing reports that the Jaadoo seeds had done well in a neighbouring village. Farmers also seek advice from non-household experts such as pesticide shop managers and university extension agents. There is no objective cost-benefit analysis because the costs and benefits are ambiguous due to things variations of factors like weather and pests and farmers having no reliable measure for what constitutes a good yield for cotton.

=== Industries ===

Several major manufacturing and services industries are in operation mainly around Hyderabad. Automobiles and auto components, spices, mines and minerals, textiles and apparels, pharmaceutical, horticulture, and poultry farming are the main industries in Telangana.

In terms of services, Hyderabad is nicknamed &quot;Cyberabad&quot; due to the location of major software industries in the city. Prior to secession, it contributed 10% to India&#x27;s and 98% to Andhra Pradesh&#x27;s exports in the IT and ITES sectors in 2013 With Hyderabad in the front line of Telangana&#x27;s goal to promote information technology in India, the city boasts the HITEC City as its premier hub.

<text>The Spokane Valley is a valley of the Spokane River through the southern Selkirk Mountains in the U.S. state of Washington.
The valley is home to the cities of Spokane and its suburbs Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, and Millwood. The valley is bounded on the north and south by the Selkirk Mountains, on the west by the Columbia River Basalt Group, and on the east by the Rathdrum Prairie at the Idaho state border.
Mica Peak, located south of the valley, is the southernmost peak in the Selkirk Range. The mountain, along with surrounding peaks, separates the Spokane Valley from the Palouse.
The Valley contains part of the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer.

==Geography==
===Topography===
The valley exhibits signs of the prehistoric geologic events that shaped the area and region such as the Missoula Floods which ended 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The Spokane valley was gouged out by repeated failures in the ice dam that held Glacial Lake Missoula. The protected Dishman Hills Natural Resources Conservation Area to the west, with its rugged, potholed appearance and deep gullies is a result of the Missoula Floods as well and represents one of the most ecologically diverse regions in Washington state, where forests, grasslands and shrublands converge and is within two ecoregions, the Okanagan and Northern Rockies ecoregions. The geography further to the southeast, such as the Saltese Flats and Saltese Uplands is characterized as a shrub–steppe landscape with grassy hills and ravines.

===Climate===
Most of the valley is classified as a Mediterranean Climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), however the western slope of the Saltese Uplands closely border on a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;Bsk&quot;).

==History==
===Early history===

For thousands of years, native peoples lived in the Valley, and included it in their seasonal migrations, where they hunted, fished, gathered, and dug roots. Prior to European settlers, the Valley was occupied the Spokane and Coeur d’Alene people.

Starting in the early 1800s, fur traders sent by the North West Company (later merged with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company) arrived in Spokane territory. West of the Valley, two trading posts were established near the mouth of the Little Spokane, 1810-1826 Northwest of there, missionaries established the Tshimakain Mission, 1838–1848. The first settler in the Valley was Antoine Plante, a French Canadian and Blackfoot, and his wife, Mary of the Flathead nation. He came as an employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, for which he worked for two years before becoming a Freeman. He built a small cabin near the Spokane River in 1849 (now the Plantes Ferry Recreation Park between the neighborhoods of Trentwood and Irwin), from which he ran a small Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post. He operated the first ferry across the Spokane River, the only means of crossing the river in the area, from 1852 to 1864.

===Washington Territory===
In 1853, two years after the establishment of the Washington Territory, the first governor, Isaac Stevens, made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the Spokanes at Antoine Plantes&#x27; cabin. In spite of the calming influence of Chief Garry, the Spokanes protested the loss of their lands by joining in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene War of 1858. The battle culminated in the Battle of Spokane Plains, while there was no decisive winner, the tribes were greatly weakened. The Spokanes were forced from the lands of their ancestors to a reservation north of the Spokane River, just west of the Spokane area.

In 1862, A. C. &quot;Charley&quot; Kendall established a store on the north side of the Spokane River at the far east end of the Valley. A bridge to cross the river at Kendall&#x27;s store was soon built by Joe Herring, Timothy Lee, and Ned Jordan in 1864, strategically located nearer the Mullan Road than Plante&#x27;s Ferry. A small community, known as Spokane Bridge, began to build up near the bridge. It boasts the first hotel and post office in the Valley. In 1871, it became a stop on the Pony Express, connecting The Dalles, Oregon Territory, to Missoula, Montana Territory.

Before the turn of the century, early pioneers, many of them silver miners, arrived from the East by way of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railroads, for which Spokane was a major hub. By 1883, the first transcontinental rail was established. The railroad activity created support for extensive shops and facilities. Within a few years, Spokane was tied to the outside world by five transcontinental railroads, making it the hub of commerce it remains today.

===Early 1900s===
Irrigation efforts stimulated population growth in the Spokane Valley significantly in the early part of the 20th century. Developers and real estate speculators tapped into nearby lakes, the Spokane River and the aquifer lying under the valley in an effort to turn the dry land into saleable agricultural land. In 1899, the Spokane Valley Land and Water Co., later owned by long-time irrigation advocate D.C. Corbin, built a canal to irrigate land in the Greenacres area with water from Liberty Lake. In 1905, the Spokane Canal Company built a canal to irrigate the Otis Orchard area with water from Newman Lake, and Modern Irrigation and Land Company tapped into the underground aquifer to irrigate in Opportunity. Within just twenty years, of dry land was converted into fertile farmland. Water access greatly increased land values. Valley population grew from 1,000 residents in 1900 to nearly 10,000 by 1922. Extensive apple orchards thrived in the gravelly soil of the Valley, and by 1912 nearly 2 million apple trees had been planted. A huge packing plant was built in 1911 by the Spokane Valley Growers Union.

The Spokane Valley was developed as townships. In 1908, the state granted the formation of county townships as semi-autonomous, self-governing bodies, with the same basic governing rights as most municipalities, including the ability to levy property taxes. Only Spokane and Whatcom counties took full advantage of these townships with taxing capabilities, essentially reducing the need to incorporate rural communities. These townships fulfilled the basic needs for services in the rural districts until the State revoked their taxing rights in 1969, after which the unfunded townships declined until the Spokane County voted to disorganize them in 1974. The Valley townships were East Spokane, Opportunity and Greenacres, the southern edge of Pleasant Prairie, Foothills, and Newman, and the northern edge of Chester.

A few Spokane Valley towns developed for residential and/or business purposes. Trent (now Irwin) was originally platted as a residential area for Northern Pacific railroad workers in 1881. Millwood (originally Woodward) began as a &quot;company town&quot;, developed by Inland Empire Paper Mill for their employees, and Dishman developed primarily as a business center. All other Valley townships were developed as irrigation districts and owe their existence to their agricultural roots. Between 1901 and 1915, the communities of Orchard Avenue, Greenacres, Otis Orchards, Opportunity, Vera, Dishman, Liberty Lake, Newman Lake, East Spokane, Mica and Chester were platted. Pasadena Park is a populated place located in Spokane County at latitude 47.697 and longitude -117.283, North of Millwood across the Spokane River that existed at least as early as 1916.

The Spokane Valley was promoted as a wonderful place to live. Though most Valley residents were farmers or orchardists, canneries, brickyards, railroad maintenance facilities and lumber mills provided jobs for many. The beauty of the surrounding area, pleasant communities, fertile farmlands, business opportunities, outdoor sports and activities, local recreational areas and community organizations caused it to be called &quot;Spokane Valley, the Valley Bountiful&quot;. As the population increased, small
communities with schools, churches, businesses, community clubs and organizations thrived. Tied to Spokane, local lakes and Coeur d’Alene by railroads and bus systems, the people of the Valley enjoyed a full life.

In the years that followed, crop troubles and irrigation system maintenance problems prompted many residents to sell their farms in five, ten, or plots for suburban home sites. Many of the apple trees were pulled out and replaced by neighborhoods and truck farms. The truck farms were successful in raising strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes, beans, peas, watermelons, asparagus, squash, cucumbers and thousands of acres of Heart of Gold cantaloupes. Dairy, poultry and fur farms also appeared in the Valley during these years.

===1930s to 1950s===
While jobs were scarce during the Great Depression, most people in the Spokane Valley had enough land to grow food for their families. The Spokane Valley Chamber of Commerce adhered to a positive agenda throughout these hard times. They placed street signs on Valley roads and in an effort to show solidarity with Spokane, east–west roads were renamed to correspond with Spokane&#x27;s roads. Observing that fires were a constant and catastrophic problem for area residents, the Chamber lobbied to begin a fire protection district in the Valley. Their efforts were successful and Valley residents were first offered fire protection in 1940, with the formation of Spokane County Fire Protection District Number One.

Spokane University, a four-year liberal arts college operated in the Spokane Valley from 1913 to 1933. when it closed due to financial difficulties amid the Great Depression. It briefly reopened as Spokane Valley Junior College, before facilities were moved to Spokane&#x27;s South Hill and merged into the newly formed Spokane Junior College in 1935. The campus of Spokane University was eventually used by University High School from 1962 until 2002, when it relocated to new facilities. The campus has been occupied by Valley Christian School since 2005.

The people of the valley always maintained independence from the City of Spokane on its borders. The first local newspaper, The Spokane Valley Herald, was launched in 1920. In 1919 an early municipal airfield was carved out, later named Felts Field in honor of Herald owner Buell Felts who died in a plane crash there. A streetcar line was started as early as 1908, and later extended to Liberty Lake in the east part of the valley, where entertainment facilities were built for music and outdoor gatherings. Other than Millwood, which incorporated in 1927 and Liberty Lake, Washington which did so in 2001, the Valley remained unincorporated throughout the 20th century.

Industry began to replace agriculture more rapidly after the completion of Grand Coulee Dam in 1941, which combined cheap electricity with readily available water from the Spokane River and the extensive aquifer which underlies the Valley. At its height, the Valley was the site for an aluminum plant, a cement plant and a paper mill. Plans to attract light industry through the establishment of an industrial park at a former military depot were not very successful. The cement plant closed in the 1950s, but the paper mill and aluminum plant remain.

In the 1950s a further transformation swept the valley as the post World War II population boom began to push into the valley, replacing most of the remaining apple orchards with tracts of houses. The first shopping mall was built at University Village on Sprague Avenue (formerly called Appleway), which became the major artery through the Valley, lined with stores and restaurants. The last large-scale orchard irrigations ended in the late 1950s, canvas pipes running down residential streets replacing the old ditches by that time.

===Last half of 20th century===
In the later decades of the last century, the Valley experienced a large influx of retirees due to inexpensive housing and the relatively dry weather. Retirement complexes and apartment blocks began to appear. At the present time the Valley remains principally a suburban area, a mixture of families and retirees and the retail commerce to support them. In the 1990s and the early part of the twenty-first century the Spokane Valley continued to grow more urban, becoming one of the fastest growing regions in the state. Commercial growth increased and joined residential growth as it moved towards the state line. The urban development included the opening of the long-awaited Spokane Valley Mall in 1997, the establishment of dozens of other businesses along business corridors, and the development of the Mirabeau Point community complex.

<doc id="990279" wikidata="Q468626" url="?curid=990279" title="Grigory Sokolov">
<text>Grigory Lipmanovich Sokolov (; born April 18, 1950) is a Russian pianist with Spanish citizenship. He is among the most esteemed of living pianists, his repertoire spanning composers from the Baroque period such as Bach, Couperin or Rameau up to Schoenberg and Arapov. He regularly tours Europe (excluding the UK) and resides in Italy.

== Biography ==
Sokolov was born in Leningrad (Russian SSR, Soviet Union, now Saint Petersburg) to Jewish father Lipman Girshevich Sokolov and Russian mother Galina Nikolayevna Zelenetskaya. He began studying the piano at the age of five and entered the Leningrad Conservatory&#x27;s special school for children at the age of seven to study with Leah Zelikhman. After graduating from the children&#x27;s school, he continued studying at the Conservatory with Moisey Khalfin. At 12, he gave his first major recital in Moscow, in a concert of works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Liszt, Debussy and Shostakovich at the Philharmonic Society. At age 16, he came to international attention when he was awarded the gold medal in the 1966 International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, making him the youngest ever winner. It seems this may have been a surprising result: &quot;16-year old Grisha Sokolov, who finally became the winner of that competition, was not taken seriously by anyone at that time.&quot;

Despite his success at the Tchaikovsky Competition in his youth, Sokolov&#x27;s international career only began to develop towards the end of the 1980s. It has been speculated that this was because of his not defecting and the limited travelling allowed under the Soviet regime, but this is refuted by the fact that Sokolov gave U.S. tours in 1969, 1971, 1975 and 1979, as well as numerous recitals elsewhere in the world, eg Finland and Japan. &quot;Sokolov&#x27;s life as a touring soloist is quite overcrowded. He tours a great deal in both his motherland and abroad.&quot;
The 1980s seem to have posed something of a stumbling block to Sokolov&#x27;s career in the U.S. &quot;In the beginning, I played a lot of single concerts in America, in 1969, &#x27;71 and, I think, 1975. After that there was a break in relationships between the U.S. and the Soviet Union — they were disconnected by the Afghanistan war. A scheduled tour in the U.S. was cancelled in 1980. Then all cultural agreements between the two countries were cancelled.&quot; In addition, during the breakup of the former Soviet Union, Sokolov played no concerts outside Russia.
He is now a well-known figure in concert halls around Europe, but much less so in the U.S. Sokolov has released relatively few recordings to date, and released none for the 20 years between 1995 and 2015. But in 2014 he signed a contract with Deutsche Grammophon to release recordings of some of his live performances, and in 2015 he released a 2-CD live Salzburg recital featuring two sonatas by Mozart, Chopin&#x27;s cycle of 24 Preludes, and encore pieces by Scriabin, Chopin, Rameau, Purcell and Bach.

In August 2022, he was granted Spanish nationality.

==Public statements==

In March 2009, Sokolov cancelled a planned concert in London because of British visa requirements demanding that all non-E.U. workers provide fingerprints and eye prints with every visa application (he also cancelled his 2008 concert on seemingly similar grounds). Sokolov protested that such requirements had echoes of Soviet oppression.

After British music journalist Norman Lebrecht received the Cremona Music Award 2014, Sokolov, upon learning of his being awarded the Cremona Music Award 2015, refused to accept the honour, making this statement on his website: &quot;According to my ideas about elementary decency, it is shame to be in the same award-winners list with Lebrecht.&quot; Sokolov&#x27;s statement appeared to refer to personal remarks Lebrecht had made about Sokolov&#x27;s family.

== Influences ==
Sokolov cited the following pianists as having inspired him in his years of studies:
&quot;Of those whom I heard on the stage I&#x27;d like to name first of all Emil Gilels. Judging by the records, it was Rachmaninoff, Sofronitsky, Glenn Gould, Solomon [and] Lipatti. As to aesthetics, I feel most close to Anton Rubinstein.&quot;

== Repertoire ==
In 2006, Sokolov explained his decision to give fewer concerto performances. Among the adverse factors he cited were inadequate rehearsal time and that one can rarely pair with a conductor whose approach fits his own. He also said that by repeating his solo programs in many venues over time, he deepens his interpretations, whereas a concerto performance starts over at the first rehearsal in each engagement.

==Recordings==
Sokolov originally published on the &quot;Opus 111&quot; label, later acquired by Naïve Records. Since 2015 he has been represented by Deutsche Grammophon.

<text>The Curriculum Council of Western Australia is a defunct government department that once set curriculum policy directions for kindergarten to year 12 schooling in Western Australia. It was located at 27 Walters Drive, Osborne Park, Western Australia 6017. The Curriculum Council was governed by the 1997 Curriculum Council Act.

Set up in 1997, the Council was disbanded following a litany of failures in 2012. It was replaced by the School Curriculum and Standards Authority.

The goal of the Curriculum Council was to provide for the development and implementation of a &quot;Curriculum Framework&quot; for schooling which sets out the knowledge, understandings, skills, values and attitudes that students are expected to acquire; provides for the development and accreditation of courses of study for post-compulsory schooling; and provides for the assessment and certification of student achievement.

==Principles==
Student learning is the major stated principle of the Curriculum. The Curriculum policy directions are underpinned by the following stated principles:

* an encompassing view of the Curriculum (K-12);
* a recognition of the significance of learning outcomes;
* fair and explicit standards; 
* inclusivity; 
* an agreed set of values; 
* consultative and transparent decision making processes; 
* collaboration with stakeholders.

==History==
Paul Albert was appointed as the inaugural Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council by the then Education Minister, Colin Barnett, shortly after the formation of the Council in 1997 when it superseded the Secondary Education Authority. Albert was appointed on a five-year contract, and left the Council in 2001, leaving Norma Jeffery as the CEO.

Norma Jeffery was appointed as Chief Executive of the Council in 2003. Jeffery was responsible for the implementation of the Curriculum Framework and in 2005 began to introduce the new courses of study into Year 11 of senior high schools in Western Australia under the direction of the then Education Minister Ljiljanna Ravlich.

Jeffery commissioned a report on the assessment scheme that was to be used in the controversial system of outcomes based education from Professor David Andrich, the Dean of Education at Murdoch University in 2005. The report was duly completed later the same year and found that &quot;strongly argued case for marks arising from analytic assessments to be used for tertiary selection&quot; and against the levelling system that was currently being used. Consequently, Jeffery was removed from her position and transferred elsewhere in the public service and replaced by Greg Robson. Robson left shortly afterward accepting a position in the Department of Education in South Australia.

David Axworthy, who was appointed as the acting Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council in 2005, announced in July 2006 that he would not continue in the position. This followed widespread opposition to the introduction of the state&#x27;s ill-conceived outcomes based education system into the school system that Axworthy was in charge of. As a result, the Council was going to have to find its fourth Chief Executive in twelve months.

Dave Wood was appointed to the role of Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council in 2006, in the midst of a furore of the botched introduction of Outcomes Based Education in schools in Western Australia.

In 2009 the Council miscalculated final scores for students who had completed practical tests for three courses.

The Chief Executive of the Curriculum Council, Dave Wood, was dumped in 2010 by the then education minister, Liz Constable, following a string of errors being identified in the WACE examinations from 2010. The minister stated that &quot;serious problems&quot; with the Year 12 examinations were the reason Woods&#x27; contract was not renewed. Errors had been identified in the History, Physics, Maths, English and Business Management and Enterprise exams, evidence of failures in the Council&#x27;s proof-reading processes.

Some of the mistakes included a Physics question where the incorrect unit of measurement was used, a History exam where an image was labelled 1915 instead of 1925., a Mathematics exam where an incorrect answer had been given in an example question, a Music exam where questions were asked that were not in the subject syllabus. Other more serious blunders by the Council included a printing error in an Economics exam where questions from the History course had been included and an exam supervisor allowing students to use notes when they were not supposed to.

In another instance of outright incompetence a Food Science and Technology exam had to be rewritten after it had been displayed on the Council web-site for two days.

The Council claimed that the mistakes were the result of budget cuts, although its budget had actually increased from 7 Million in 2007 to 14 million in 2010.

Both the Council charmain, Professor Bill Louden, and the Chief Executive, Dave Wood, were reprimanded by the then Minister of Education, Liz Constable after she had expressly asked them to recheck all papers after initial errors were discovered.

Further problems occurred in 2011 when complaints about the Chemistry exam made by teachers concerned that a large proportion of the exam had been devoted to an obscure part of the course. Also the exam had asked for an essay to be written on a topic when the exam design brief specified that only short paragraph style answers were required. The current acting Chief Executive, Allan Blagaich, claimed that the exams did fit the design brief. Additional complaints were also made about the Modern History and the English exam.

The Curriculum Council was disbanded in 2012 and replaced by the new School Curriculum and Standards Authority, to be chaired by Patrick Garnett.

<text>Rayalaseema (IAST: &quot;Rāyalasīma&quot;) is a geographic region in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It comprises four southern districts of the State, from prior to the districts reorganisation in 2022, namely Kurnool, Anantapur, YSR, and Chittoor. Four new districts were created from these, namely Sri Sathya Sai, Nandyal, Annamayya, and Tirupati. As of 2011 census of India, the western four districts (before the district realignment) of the region had a population of 15,184,908 and cover an area of .

== Etymology ==
The region was previously called &quot;Ceded districts&quot; during the rule of the British Raj. This is with reference to the time when the Nizam of Hyderabad, Ali Khan, ceded the region to the British as a part of subsidiary alliance. Chilukuri Narayana Rao, a Telugu lecturer and activist from Anantapur, deemed the term &quot;ceded&quot; as derogatory and coined the term &quot;Rayalaseema&quot;. In the Andhra Mahasabha and Ceded Districts Conference held at Nandyala in November 1928, he moved a resolution to the effect which was accepted by the other delegates of the conference.

The name &quot;Rayalaseema&quot; hearkened back to the Vijayanagara times, whose Kings used a suffix &quot;Rāya&quot; (tadbhava of Sanskrit Rāja) or &quot;Rāyalu&quot; in Telugu as their regnal title. The boundaries of Rayalaseema roughly match the territorial extent of the Aravidu dynasty, the last dynasty to rule the Vijayanagara Empire. People of region coined their land as a Raya Desam.

=== Post independence ===
The four districts of the region were part of the Madras Presidency until 1953. From 1953 to 1956, the region was a part of Andhra State and in 1956, the Telangana region was merged with Andhra State to form Andhra Pradesh State. On 2 February 1970, three taluks from Kurnool i.e., Markapur, Cumbum and Giddalur were merged along with some other taluks of Nellore district and Guntur district to form Prakasam district.

In February 2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of Telangana state comprising ten districts. Hyderabad will remain as a joint capital for 10 years for both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The new State of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the President of India. The formation of a new state named &quot;Telangana&quot; from &quot;Andhra Pradesh&quot; is not considered an amendment to the Constitution of India per article 3 and 4 of that document.

<doc id="990297" wikidata="Q882615" url="?curid=990297" title="John Collins (Continental Congress)">
<text>John Collins (June 8, 1717March 4, 1795), was an American politician and a Founding Father of the United States who, as a member of the Continental Congress, signed the Articles of Confederation. He was the third governor of the U.S. state of Rhode Island from 1786 to 1790.

==Early life==
Born in Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, he was the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Collins.

== Political life ==
He stood forth as a staunch advocate of the independence of the Thirteen Colonies. An admirer of George Washington, he was selected by the governor of Rhode Island in 1776 to carry a letter to Washington informing him of the condition of the colony and soliciting counsel upon the best method to adopt for its defense. In 1778, Collins represented Rhode Island in the Second Continental Congress, where he served until May 1781, when he was superseded by William Ellery. He was, however, re-elected in 1782 and held the position until 1783.

In 1782, he was made bearer to the President of Congress of a statement of Rhode Island&#x27;s reasons for rejecting the Impost Act. During the American Revolution, Rhode Island was for the most part an agricultural area, and as such opposed the restrictions of a national government. The state&#x27;s agricultural interests vigorously advocated a paper currency. Collins espoused their cause and in 1786 was elected governor. During his term in office, the issuance of paper money, which had been ceased at intervals since 1750, was resumed. It was provided by law that should any creditor refuse to accept the bills of the state the debtor might secure a discharge by depositing the amount of his debt with one of the judges of the state superior court or the court of common pleas. This law led to the suit of &quot;Trevett vs. Weeden&quot;, which resulted in a decision looking toward the right of courts to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional.

==Rhode Island&#x27;s ratification of the U.S. Constitution==

When Washington was inaugurated as President of the United States on April 30, 1789, Rhode Island was one of only two of the thirteen original states (along with North Carolina) not to have ratified the United States Constitution and was, technically speaking, an independent nation with Collins as it chief of state. Anti-Federalist elements in Rhode Island vigorously fought against the calling of a convention to decide upon entering the Federal Union, but on January 17, 1790, gave its sanction to such a call by a majority of one vote in the General Assembly. This vote was cast by Collins, who had come to realize the importance of a Federal connection. The vote cost him his popularity and the governorship. He left office on May 5, 1790. The Rhode Island General Assembly ratified the United States Constitution on May 29. Later in 1790, Collins was elected to the 1st Congress but did not take his seat.

==Personal life==

Collins was married to Mary, daughter of John Avery of Boston, and his daughter Abigail married John Warren. Collins died at Newport and was buried on his farm, &quot;Brenton Neck&quot;, near Brenton Point in that city. His grandson and namesake, John Collins Covell (1823–1887), was a principal of the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind and West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution holds an annual observance of Rhode Island Independence Day (May 4) at Governor Collins&#x27; grave. John Collins was a close friend of Benjamin Franklin when he was young. John Collins and Benjamin Franklin unfortunately broke off their friendship after trouble due to money, as detailed in &quot;The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin 1771-1790&quot;.

<text>Ubuntu ( ) is a Linux distribution derived from Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. Ubuntu is officially released in multiple editions: &quot;Desktop&quot;, &quot;Server&quot;, and &quot;Core&quot; for Internet of things devices and robots. The operating system is developed by the British company Canonical and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. , the latest interim release is 24.10 (&quot;Oracular Oriole&quot;), with the most recent long-term support release being 24.04 (&quot;Noble Numbat&quot;).

As with other Linux distributions, all of the editions can run on a computer alone, or in a virtual machine. An upgrade to Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to the Ubuntu software and donations from those who download Ubuntu directly.

Ubuntu is named after the Nguni philosophy of &quot;&quot;, &quot;humanity to others&quot;, with a connotation of &quot;I am what I am because of who we all are&quot;. Since the release of the first version in 2004, Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distributions for general purposes and is backed by large online communities like Ask Ubuntu. Numerous community-editions of Ubuntu also exist. It is also popular for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.

== History ==

Ubuntu is built on Debian&#x27;s architecture and infrastructure, and comprises Linux server, desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions. Ubuntu releases updated versions predictably every six months, and each release receives free support for twelve months (eighteen months prior to 13.04) with security fixes, high-impact bug fixes and conservative, substantially beneficial low-risk bug fixes. The first release was in October 2004.

Ubuntu is currently funded by Canonical Ltd. On 8 July 2005, Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical announced the creation of the Ubuntu Foundation and provided initial funding of US$10 million. The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of Ubuntu. Mark Shuttleworth describes the foundation&#x27;s goal to ensure the continuity of the Ubuntu project.

On 12 March 2009, Ubuntu announced developer support for third-party cloud management platforms, such as those used at Amazon EC2.

In 2011, Ubuntu&#x27;s default desktop was changed from GNOME 2 to the in-house Unity instead of GNOME 3. After nearly 6.5 years, the default desktop was changed back to GNOME 3 in 2017 upon the release of version 17.10.

Ubuntu, since 16.04.5, requires a 2 GB or larger installation medium. The last release of Ubuntu available on a minimal CD was 18.04.

32-bit x86 processors were supported up to Ubuntu 18.04. It was decided to support &quot;legacy software&quot;, i.e. select 32-bit i386 packages, for Ubuntu 19.10 (since out of support) and 20.04 LTS.

On 9 August 2024, Ubuntu announced a change in policy to always use the latest upstream code of the Linux kernel at the time of each Ubuntu release, even if the kernel code hasn&#x27;t seen a stable release.

== Features ==

As of version 24.10, a default installation of Ubuntu contains a minimal selection of software, namely a web browser (Firefox) and basic GNOME utilities (including the desktop). Many additional software packages are accessible from the built-in Ubuntu Software (previously Ubuntu Software Center) as well as any other APT-based package management tools. Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by default, such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still accessible in the repositories and installable by the main tool or by any other APT-based package management tool. Cross-distribution snap packages and Flatpaks are also available, that both allow installing software, such as some of Microsoft&#x27;s software, in most of the major Linux operating systems (such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and in Fedora). The default file manager is GNOME Files, formerly called Nautilus.

All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, Ubuntu redistributes some hardware drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component.

Current long-term support (LTS) releases are supported for five years, and are released every two years. Since the release of Ubuntu 6.06, every fourth release receives long-term support. Long-term support includes updates for new hardware, security patches and updates to the &#x27;Ubuntu stack&#x27; (cloud computing infrastructure). The first LTS releases were supported for three years on the desktop and five years on the server; since Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, desktop support for LTS releases was increased to five years as well. LTS releases get regular point releases with support for new hardware and integration of all the updates published in that series to date.

Ubuntu packages are based on Debian&#x27;s unstable branch, which are synchronized every six months. Both distributions use Debian&#x27;s deb package format and package management tools (e.g. APT and Ubuntu Software). Debian and Ubuntu packages are not necessarily binary compatible with each other, however, so packages may need to be rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu. Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian. Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian, although there has been criticism that this does not happen often enough. Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible. Before release, packages are imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu-specific modifications. At some point during the release process, the Debian Import Freeze is implemented. This prevents the automatic import of packages from Debian without an explicit request from a developer. In combination with other freezes, this helps packagers ensure that frozen features interoperate well together.

== Security ==

Ubuntu aims to be secure by default. User programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other users&#x27; files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes. Polkit is also being widely implemented into the desktop.

Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking. A built-in firewall, Uncomplicated Firewall, allows end-users who install network servers to control access. A GUI is available to configure it. Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its software. These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 0.01% in 64-bit.

Ubuntu also supports full disk encryption as well as encryption of the home and private directories.

== Installation ==

The system requirements vary among Ubuntu products. For the Ubuntu desktop release 22.04 LTS (and still for 24.04.1), a PC with at least 2 GHz dual-core processor, 4 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space is recommended. For less powerful computers, there are other Ubuntu distributions such as Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Ubuntu also supports the ARM architecture. It is also available on Power ISA, while older PowerPC architecture was at one point unofficially supported, and now newer Power ISA CPUs (POWER8) are supported. The x86-64 (&quot;AMD64&quot;) architecture is also officially supported.

Live images are the typical way for users to assess and subsequently install Ubuntu. These can be downloaded as a disk image (.iso) and subsequently burnt to a DVD or USB flash drive and then booted. Other methods include running the live version via Ventoy, UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer, or Startup Disk Creator (a pre-installed tool on Ubuntu, available on machines already running the OS) directly from a USB drive (making, respectively, a live DVD or live USB medium). Running Ubuntu in this way is slower than running it from a hard drive, but does not alter the computer unless specifically instructed by the user. If the user chooses to boot the live image rather than execute an installer at boot time, there is still the option to then use the Ubuntu Desktop Installer once booted into the live environment. The Ubuntu Desktop Installer replaced the former Ubiquity installer since Ubuntu 23.04. Disk images of all current and past versions are available for download at the Ubuntu web site.

Additionally, USB flash drive installations can be used to boot Ubuntu and Kubuntu in a way that allows permanent saving of user settings and portability of the USB-installed system between physical machines (however, the computers&#x27; BIOS must support booting from USB). In newer versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Live USB creator can be used to install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or without a live CD or DVD). Creating a bootable USB drive with persistence is as simple as dragging a slider to determine how much space to reserve for persistence; for this, Ubuntu employs casper.

== Package classification and support ==

Ubuntu divides most software into four domains to reflect differences in licensing and the degree of support available. Some unsupported applications receive updates from community members known as &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (MOTU), but not from Canonical Ltd.

Free software includes software that has met the Ubuntu licensing requirements, which roughly correspond to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. Exceptions, however, include firmware, in the Main category, because although some firmware is not allowed to be modified, its distribution is still permitted.

Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are made for important non-free software. Supported non-free software includes device drivers that can be used to run Ubuntu on some current hardware, such as binary-only graphics card drivers. The level of support in the Restricted category is more limited than that of Main, because the developers may not have access to the source code. It is intended that Main and Restricted should contain all software needed for a complete desktop environment.

In addition to the above, in which the software does not receive new features after an initial release, &quot;Ubuntu Backports&quot; is an officially recognised repository for backporting newer software from later versions of Ubuntu. 

The &quot;-updates&quot; repository provides stable release updates (SRU) of Ubuntu and are generally installed through update-manager. Each release is given its own -updates repository (e.g. intrepid-updates). The repository is supported by Canonical Ltd. for packages in main and restricted, and by the community for packages in universe and multiverse. All updates to the repository must meet certain requirements and go through the &quot;-proposed&quot; repository before being made available to the public. Updates are scheduled to be available until the end of life for the release.

In addition to the -updates repository, the unstable &quot;-proposed&quot; repository contains uploads that must be confirmed before being copied into -updates. All updates must go through this process to ensure that the patch does truly fix the bug and there is no risk of regression. Updates in -proposed are confirmed by either Canonical or members of the community.

Canonical previously hosted a partner repository that let vendors of proprietary software deliver their products to Ubuntu users at no cost through the same familiar tools for installing and upgrading software. The software in the partner repository was officially supported with security and other important updates by its respective vendors. Canonical supported the packaging of the software for Ubuntu and provided guidance to vendors. However, in anticipation for the release of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Canonical closed the partner repository, as the only package still hosted in it was Adobe Flash, which would not be released with 22.04. Ubuntu developer Steve Langasek said in a development mailing list that he felt the &quot;Snap Store has matured to the point that I believe it supersedes the partner archive&quot;.

=== Package Archives ===

A &quot;Personal Package Archive&quot; (PPA) is a software repository for uploading source packages to be built and published as an Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) repository by Launchpad. While the term is used exclusively within Ubuntu, Launchpad&#x27;s host, Canonical, envisions adoption beyond the Ubuntu community.

=== Third-party software ===

Some third-party software that does not limit distribution is included in Ubuntu&#x27;s multiverse component. The package &quot;ubuntu-restricted-extras&quot; additionally contains software that may be legally restricted, including support for DVD playback, Microsoft TrueType core fonts, many common audio/video codecs, and unrar, an unarchiver for files compressed in the RAR file format.

Additionally, third-party application suites are available for download via Ubuntu Software and the Snap store, including many games such as Braid, Minecraft and Oil Rush, software for DVD playback and media codecs.

== Releases ==

Each Ubuntu release has a version number that consists of the year and month number of the release. For example, the first release was Ubuntu 4.10 as it was released on 20 October 2004.

Ubuntu releases are also given alliterative code names, using an adjective and an animal (e.g., &quot;Bionic Beaver&quot;). Except the first two releases, code names are in alphabetical order, allowing a quick determination of which release is newer, at least until restarting the cycle with the release of &quot;Artful Aardvark&quot; in October 2017. Commonly, Ubuntu releases are referred to using only the adjective portion of the code name; for example, the 24.04 LTS release is commonly known as &quot;Noble&quot;. Releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases.

Upgrades from one LTS release to the next LTS release (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS etc.) are supported, while upgrades from non-LTS have only supported upgrade to the next release, regardless of its LTS status (e.g. Ubuntu 23.10 to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). However, it is possible to skip an LTS upgrade, going straight from 16.04 LTS to 18.04.5 LTS, by waiting for a point release that supports such updating.

LTS releases have optional extended security maintenance (ESM) support available, including e.g. 18.04 &quot;Bionic&quot; that is otherwise out of public support, adding support for that version up to 2028, giving a total of 10 years.

Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat), was released on 10 October 2010 (10–10–10). This departed from the traditional schedule of releasing at the end of October to get &quot;the perfect 10&quot;, and makes a playful reference to &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; books, since, in binary, 101010 equals decimal 42, the &quot;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; within the series.

== Variants ==

Ubuntu Desktop (formally named as Ubuntu Desktop Edition, and simply called Ubuntu) is the variant officially recommended for most users. It is designed for desktop and laptop PCs and is officially supported by Canonical. Variants are distinguished simply by each featuring a different desktop environment, or, in the case of Ubuntu Server, no desktop. LXQt and Xfce are often recommended for use with older PCs that may have less memory and processing power available.

=== Official distributions ===

Most Ubuntu editions and flavours simply install a different set of default packages compared to the standard Ubuntu Desktop. Since they share the same package repositories, all of the same software is available for each of them. Ubuntu Core is the sole exception as it only has access to packages in the Snap Store.

Ubuntu had some official distributions that have been discontinued, such as Gobuntu; including some previously supported by Canonical, like Ubuntu Touch, that is now maintained by volunteers (UBports Community).

=== Unofficial distributions ===

Alongside the official flavours are those that are unofficial. These are still in the process of becoming recognised as official flavours by Canonical.
=== Cloud computing ===

Ubuntu offers Ubuntu Cloud Images which are pre-installed disk images that have been customised by Ubuntu engineering to run on cloud-platforms such as Amazon EC2, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure and LXC. Ubuntu is also prevalent on VPS platforms such as DigitalOcean.
Ubuntu has support for OpenStack, with Eucalyptus to OpenStack migration tools added by Canonical. Ubuntu 11.10 added focus on OpenStack as the Ubuntu&#x27;s preferred IaaS offering, though Eucalyptus is also supported. Another major focus is Canonical Juju for provisioning, deploying, hosting, managing, and orchestrating enterprise data centre infrastructure services, by, with, and for the Ubuntu Server.

== Adoption and reception ==
=== Installed base ===

As Ubuntu is distributed freely and historically, there was no registration process (still optional), Ubuntu usage can only be roughly estimated. In 2015, Canonical&#x27;s Ubuntu Insights page stated, &quot;Ubuntu now has over 40 million desktop users and counting&quot;.

W3Techs Web Technology Surveys estimated in November 2020 that:
* Ubuntu is by far the most popular Linux distribution for running web servers; of the websites they analyse it is &quot;used by 47.3% of all the websites who use Linux&quot;, and Ubuntu alone powers more websites than Microsoft Windows, which powers 28.2% of all websites, or 39% of the share Unix has (which includes Linux and thus Ubuntu). All Linux/Unix distributions in total power well over twice the number of hosts as Windows for websites based on W3Techs numbers. Ubuntu and Debian only (which Ubuntu is based on, with the same package manager and thus administered the same way) make up 65% of all Linux distributions for web serving use; the usage of Ubuntu surpassed Debian (for such server use) in May 2016.
* Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution among the top 1,000 sites and gains around 500 of the top 10 million websites per day.
W3Techs analyses the top 10 million websites only. 

Wikimedia Foundation data (based on user agent) for September 2013 shows that Ubuntu generated the most page requests to Wikimedia sites, including Wikipedia, among recognizable Linux distributions.

, Ubuntu 22.04 is used in Microsoft NDv5, a Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud computer, its fastest one (of 7 Azure supercomputers, all running on Ubuntu), currently 3rd fastest supercomputer on the TOP500 list (only beaten by the only two exaflop computers; is itself half an exaflop, only the top 3 are that powerful). Other supercomputers running Ubuntu also rank high on the list e.g. NVIDIA&#x27;s Selene supercomputer still ranks highly, and was fifth-fastest one in the world in November 2022 after an upgrade from seventh place, where it entered the list in June. Another Nvidia-based supercomputer using Ubuntu previously topped the Green500 list (it and the next one was also Ubuntu-based), a list which is a reordering of former list, ordered by power-efficiency. On the TOP500 list, that supercomputer was ranked 170nd (and many Ubuntu-based rank higher than that).

=== Large-scale deployments ===

The public sector has also adopted Ubuntu. , the Ministry of Education and Science of North Macedonia deployed more than 180,000 Ubuntu-based classroom desktops, and has encouraged every student in the country to use Ubuntu-powered computer workstations; the Spanish school system has 195,000 Ubuntu desktops. The French police, having already started using open-source software in 2005 by replacing Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org, decided to transition to Ubuntu from Windows XP after the release of Windows Vista in 2006. By March 2009, the Gendarmerie Nationale had already switched 5,000 workstations to Ubuntu. Based on the success of that transition, it planned to switch 15,000 more over by the end of 2009 and to have switched all 90,000 workstations over by 2015 (GendBuntu project). Lt. Colonel Guimard announced that the move was very easy and allowed for a 70% saving on the IT budget without having to reduce its capabilities. In 2011, Ubuntu 10.04 was adopted by the Indian justice system.

In 2004, the city of Munich, Germany, started the LiMux project, and later forked Kubuntu 10.04 LTS for use on the city&#x27;s computers. After originally planning to migrate 12,000 desktop computers to LiMux, it was announced in December 2013 that the project had completed successfully with the migration of 14,800 out of 15,500 desktop computers, but still keeping about 5,000 Windows clients for unported applications. In February 2017 the majority coalition decided, against heavy protest from the opposition, to evaluate the migration back to Windows, after Microsoft had decided to move its company headquarters to Munich. Governing Mayor Dieter Reiter cited lack of compatibility with systems outside of the administrative sector, such as requiring a governmental mail server to send e-mails to his personal smartphone, as reasons for the return, but has been criticised for evaluating administrative IT based on private and business standards. In May 2020, the recently elected Alliance 90/The Greens party and the Social Democrat party negotiated a new coalition agreement, stating: &quot;Where it is technologically and financially possible, the city will emphasize open standards and free open-source licensed software&quot;.

In March 2012, the government of Iceland launched a project to get all public institutions using free and open-source software. Already, several government agencies and schools have adopted Ubuntu. The government cited cost savings as a big factor for the decision, and also stated that open-source software avoids vendor lock-in. A 12-month project was launched to migrate the biggest public institutions in Iceland to using open-source software, and help ease the migration for others. US president Barack Obama&#x27;s successful campaign for re-election in 2012 used Ubuntu in its IT department. In August 2014, the city of Turin, Italy, announced its migration from Windows XP to Ubuntu for the 8,300 desktop computers used by the municipality, becoming the first city in Italy to adopt Ubuntu.

Starting in 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization behind Wikipedia, switched from multiple different Linux operating systems to Ubuntu.

=== Reception ===

Ubuntu was awarded the Reader Award for best Linux distribution at the 2005 LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in London, received favourable reviews in online and print publications, and has won InfoWorld&#x27;s 2007 Bossie Award for &quot;Best Open Source Client OS&quot;. In early 2008, &quot;PC World&quot; named Ubuntu the &quot;best all-around Linux distribution available today&quot;, though it criticized the lack of an integrated desktop effects manager. Chris DiBona, the program manager for open-source software at Google, said &quot;I think Ubuntu has captured people&#x27;s imaginations around the Linux desktop,&quot; and &quot;If there is a hope for the Linux desktop, it would be them&quot;. , almost half of Google&#x27;s 20,000 employees used Goobuntu, a slightly modified version of Ubuntu. In 2012, &quot;ZDNet&quot; reported that Ubuntu was still Google&#x27;s desktop of choice. In March 2016, Matt Hartley picked a list of best Linux distributions for Datamation; he chose Ubuntu as number one.

In 2008, Jamie Hyneman, co-host of the American television series &quot;MythBusters&quot;, advocated Linux (giving the example of Ubuntu) as a solution to software bloat. Other celebrity users of Ubuntu include science fiction writer Cory Doctorow and actor Stephen Fry.
In January 2014, the UK&#x27;s authority for computer security, CESG, reported that Ubuntu 12.04 LTS was &quot;the only operating system that passes as many as 9 out of 12 requirements without any significant risks&quot;, though it was unclear if any other Linux distributions were tested.

=== 32-bit &quot;deprecation&quot; controversy ===
In June 2019, Canonical announced that they would be deprecating support for 32-bit applications and libraries in Ubuntu 19.10.

Because Steam&#x27;s Linux client depends on these 32-bit libraries, Valve announced that they would no longer be supporting Ubuntu. After uproar from the Linux gaming community, Canonical backtracked on this decision and decided to support select 32-bit libraries. As a result, Valve decided that Steam would support Ubuntu 19.10 again.

Wine needs most of the same 32-bit library packages that the Steam package depends on, and more, to enable its version of WoW64 to run 32-bit Windows applications. The parts of Wine that would continue to function without 32-bit libraries would be limited to the subset of Windows applications that have a 64-bit version, removing decades of Windows compatibility. In Canonical&#x27;s statement on bringing back the libraries, they mentioned using &quot;container technology&quot; in the future to make sure that Wine continues to function.

=== Conformity with European data privacy law ===

Soon after being introduced in 2012, doubts emerged on the conformance of the &quot;shopping lens&quot; (a feature that displays Amazon suggestions in the searching tool Unity Dash) with the European Data Protection Directive. A petition was later signed and delivered to Canonical demanding various modifications to the feature to clearly frame it within European law. Canonical did not reply.

In 2013, a formal complaint on the shopping lens was filed with the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO), the UK data privacy office. Almost one year later, the ICO ruled in favour of Canonical, considering the various improvements introduced to the feature conformed with the Data Protection Directive. According to European rules, this ruling is automatically effective in the entirety of the European Union. However, the ruling also made clear that at the time of introduction the feature was not legal, among other things, since it was missing a privacy policy statement.

=== System terminal advertising controversies ===
Ubuntu has integrated increasing quantities of advertising into the operating system&#x27;s terminal, leading to multiple controversies with its user base.

In 2017, Canonical placed a message regarding HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley in the MOTD file, causing the message to be shown whenever a terminal session started. Over the following years, more messages would be placed into the MOTD.

In 2022, ads for Ubuntu&#x27;s premium service, Ubuntu Advantage, were introduced into the apt system update utility. This move caused controversy in the user community, with some users considering advertising a fair business model to support development, while other users found the inclusion inappropriate and annoying.

== Local communities (LoCos) ==
To reach out to users who are less technical, and to foster a sense of community around the distribution, Local Communities, better known as &quot;LoCos&quot;, have been established throughout the world. Originally, each country had one LoCo Team. However, in some areas, most notably the United States and Canada, each state or province may establish a team. A LoCo Council approves teams based upon their efforts to aid in either the development or the promotion of Ubuntu.

== Hardware vendor support ==

Ubuntu works closely with OEMs to jointly make Ubuntu available on a wide range of devices. These vendors offer computers with Ubuntu pre-installed, including Dell, Hasee, Sharp Corporation, OnLogic, and Cirrus7. Specifically, Dell offers the XPS 13 laptop, Developer Edition with Ubuntu pre-installed. Together, Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Acer offer over 200 desktop and over 400 laptop PCs preloaded with Ubuntu. System76 computers are also sold with Ubuntu. Dell and System76 customers can choose between 30-day, three-month, and yearly Ubuntu support plans through Canonical. Dell computers (running Ubuntu 10.04) included extra support for ATI/AMD Video Graphics, Dell Wireless, fingerprint readers, HDMI, Bluetooth, DVD playback (using LinDVD), and MP3/WMA/WMV. Asus also sold some Eee PCs with Ubuntu pre-installed and announced &quot;many more&quot; models running Ubuntu for 2011. Vodafone has made available a notebook for the South African market called &quot;Webbook&quot;.
Dell sells computers (initially Inspiron 14R and 15R laptops) preloaded with Ubuntu in India and China, with 850 and 350 retail outlets respectively. Starting in 2013, Alienware began offering its X51 model gaming desktop pre-installed with Ubuntu at a lower price than if it were pre-installed with Windows.

While Linux already works on IBM&#x27;s mainframe system (Linux on IBM Z), IBM in collaboration with Canonical (and SUSE; &quot;Linux Foundation will form a new Open Mainframe Project&quot;) announced Ubuntu support for their z/Architecture for the first time (IBM claimed their system, IBM zEnterprise System, version z13, the most powerful computer in the world in 2015; it was then the largest computer by transistor count; again claimed fastest in 2017 with IBM z14), at the time of their &quot;biggest code drop&quot; (&quot;LinuxOne&quot;) in Linux history.

In early 2015, Intel launched the Intel Compute Stick small form factor computer available preloaded with Ubuntu or Windows operating systems.

== Windows interoperability ==
Many Windows applications can be run on Ubuntu, much like in other Linux distributions, using the Wine compatibility layer, which can be managed via frontends such as Bottles.

Multiple Windows virtual machines can also be installed by KVM/QEMU and Virt-Manager. Graphics settings are easiest in QXL/SPICE mode. For 3D accelerated graphics performance, there is a third-party VirGL driver or GPU Full Passthrough mode.

In a networked environment, file sharing between Ubuntu Linux and Windows is possible by Samba client/server software. Host Ubuntu Linux and the guest Windows virtual machines are also virtually networked in KVM, so file sharing between the host and virtual guest machines can also be done by the Samba in the KVM environment.

RDP server of GNOME Remote Desktop and Remmina client software is used for remote desktop connection between Ubuntu Linux and the other OSs.

In March 2016, Microsoft announced that it would support the Ubuntu userland on top of the Windows 10 kernel by implementing the Linux system calls as a subsystem. At the time, it was focused on command-line tools like Bash and was aimed at software developers. WSL was made available with Windows 10, version 1709. As of 2019, other Linux distributions are also supported.

In 2019, Microsoft announced the new subsystem that includes a Linux kernel, that Canonical announced will have &quot;full support for Ubuntu&quot;. By this time, it was possible to run graphical Linux apps on Windows. In 2021, Microsoft went on to add out-of-the-box support for graphical Linux apps, through the project.

In May 2021, Microsoft extended its Threat and Vulnerability Management solution, which was a Windows-only solution thus far, to support Ubuntu, RHEL, and CentOS. Starting with version 6, PowerShell runs on Ubuntu and can manage both Windows and Ubuntu computers remotely from either platforms.

<text>John Collins (March 1, 1776 – April 16, 1822) was an American manufacturer and politician from Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and served as Governor of Delaware from 1821 until his death in 1822.

==Early life and family==
He was born at Collins Mill Pond, in Nanticoke Hundred, Sussex County, Delaware, the son of Captain John and Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Houston Collins. Captain John Collins had mined bog ore from his property and served twelve years in the Delaware General Assembly. The sister of the younger John, married future Governor David Hazzard. The younger John himself married Jane Hall, daughter of former Governor David Hall, and had six children, Theophilus, John, Joseph, Sarah, Catherine, and Martha. Their home was at the Collins Mill Pond in Nanticoke Hundred, where he continued the operation of a mill. It is believed they were members of the Methodist Church.

==Political career==
Collins was elected governor in 1820 by defeating the Federalist candidate, a longtime member of the General Assembly, Jesse Green. He was governor from January 16, 1821 until his death on April 16, 1822. Collins was known for his interest in improving public education. It was during his term that a controversial transit duty began being assessed to support the beginning of a new college in Newark. He also appointed Willard Hall, the future &quot;father of public education,&quot; as secretary of state. Both of these actions would achieve results in later years.

==Death and legacy==
Collins died at Collins Mill Pond, in Nanticoke Hundred, Sussex County, Delaware at the age of 46. He is buried there on the family farm. No known portrait of John Collins exists.

==Almanac==
Elections were held on the first Tuesday of October. The governor takes office the third Tuesday in January, and had a three-year term.

<text>Thysdrus was a Carthaginian town and Roman colony near present-day El Djem, Tunisia. Under the Romans, it was the center of olive oil production in the provinces of Africa and Byzacena and was quite prosperous. The surviving amphitheater is a World Heritage Site.

==Name==

The Punic name of the town was (). The Latin name &quot;&quot; has Berber roots.

==History==

Thysdrus began as a small Carthaginian and Berber village.

Following the Punic Wars, it was refounded as a Roman town and probably received some of Julius Caesar&#x27;s veterans as settlers in 45BC. Punic culture remained long predominant, with the city minting bronze coins as late as Augustus with Punic inscriptions. Some bore Astarte&#x27;s head obverse and a lyre reverse; others bore &quot;Poseidon&quot;&#x27;s head obverse and a capricorn reverse.

Roman Africa was less arid than modern Tunisia, and Thysdrus and the surrounding lands in Byzacena were an important center of olive oil production and export. Its greatest importance occurred under the Severan dynasty in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. Septimius Severus was a native of Roman Africa and bestowed a great deal of imperial favor upon it. He raised Thysdrus to municipality status () with partial Roman citizenship.

By the early 3rd century when its huge amphitheater was built, Thysdrus rivaled Hadrumetum (present-day Sousse) as the second city of Roman North Africa, after Carthage (near present-day Tunis). The city had even a huge racetrack (&quot;&quot;), nearly as large as the Circus Maximus at Rome and capable of accommodating about 30,000 spectators.

In AD238, Thysdrus was at the center of a struggle to control the Roman Empire. After Maximinus Thrax killed Emperor Alexander Severus at Moguntiacum in Germania Inferior and assumed the throne, his oppressive rule resulted in universal discontent. Maximinus&#x27;s procurator in Africa, in particular, sought to extract the maximum level of taxation and fines possible, including falsifying charges against the local aristocracy. A riot among the 50,000 Thysdrians ended with the death of the procurator, after which they turned to Gordian and demanded that he accept the dangerous honor of the imperial throne. After protesting that he was too old for the position, he eventually yielded to the popular clamor of the Thysdrians and assumed both the purple and the epithet &quot;&quot; (&quot;the African&quot;) on March 22. According to Edward Gibbon:

Due to his advanced age, he insisted that his son M. Antonius Gordianus be acclaimed as his coruler. A few days later, Gordian entered the city of Carthage with the overwhelming support of the population and local political leaders. Meanwhile, in Rome, Maximinus&#x27;s praetorian prefect was assassinated and the rebellion seemed to be successful. Gordian in the meantime had sent an embassy to Rome under the leadership of P. Licinius Valerianus to obtain the Senate&#x27;s support for his rebellion. 

The senate confirmed the new emperor on 2 April and many of the provinces gladly sided with Gordian.

Opposition would come from the neighboring province of Numidia. Its governor Capelianus, a loyal supporter of Maximinus and a stalwart opponent of Gordian, renewed his alliance to the emperor and invaded the province of Africa with the only legion stationed in the region and other veteran units. GordianII, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers mostly from Thysdrus and surroundings, lost the Battle of Carthage and was killed. Gordian killed himself in his villa near Carthage by hanging himself with his belt. The Gordians had &quot;reigned&quot; only thirty-six days.

Following this abortive revolt, Capelianus&#x27;s troops sacked Thysdrus. Thysdrus was subsequently raised to the level of a colony (&quot;&quot;) by in AD244. It was the seat of a Christian diocese, which is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. All the same, it never really recovered.

===Later history===

Around 695, the Romano-Berber queen Kahina destroyed most of the olive trees of the Thysdrus area in her final attempt to stop the Arab invasion. She made her final stand at the amphitheater, but was defeated.

In the next centuries, Thysdrus largely disappeared from the record, with a worsening arid climate apparently damaging its olive oil production. By the 10th century, many of Thysdrus&#x27;s buildings had been dismantled for use in construction at Kairouan. In the 19th century, French colonizers found only a small village named El Djem, with a few hundred inhabitants living around the remains of the amphitheater and barely eking out enough production from their farms to survive.

==Buildings==

The Amphitheatre of El Jem was built around AD238 and it is one of the best preserved stone Roman ruins in the world. It was named a World Heritage Site in 1979.

==Religion==
Thysdrus&#x27;s bishops attended the councils of 393, 411, and 641. The Donatist schism had a hold in the city around 411.

Hedesunda has evidence of continuous habitation from the neolithic era around 3500 BCE until today. Especially interesting is the findings after early description of iron. The oldest historical documentation in the area consist of runic stones and a very rare stone carving dated to 970 CE. It is rare because such carvings usually do not appear north of lake Mälaren. Gästriklands only ancient castle is located in Hedesunda.

It is written on parchment or paper that the archbishop Nils Allesson visited Hedesunda parish in 1302 CE. &quot;Svarta-brevet&quot; is a collection of notes on demarcation dating from the year 1402 CE. In this early document some 16 small villages around Hedesunda are mentioned.
The parish registration from Hedesunda has been diligently kept and more than 30.000 people are registered. This information has been made into a book for genealogists, in two parts of 900 pages each. The latest version was printed in 1997.

<doc id="990315" wikidata="Q6621118" url="?curid=990315" title="List of former IA-32 compatible processor manufacturers">
<text>As the 32-bit Intel Architecture became the dominant computing platform during the 1980s and 1990s, multiple companies have tried to build microprocessors that are compatible with that Intel instruction set architecture. Most of these companies were not successful in the mainstream computing market. So far, only AMD has had any market presence in the computing market for more than a couple of product generations. Cyrix was successful during the 386 and 486 generations of products but did not do well after the Pentium was introduced.

List of former IA-32 compatible microprocessor vendors:

==Progressed into surviving companies==
* Centaur Technology – originally subsidiary of IDT, later acquired by VIA Technologies, still producing compatible low-end devices for VIA
* Cyrix – acquired by National Semiconductor, later acquired by VIA Technologies, eventually shut down
* NexGen – bought by AMD to help develop the successful K6 device
* National Semiconductor – low-end 486 (designed in-house) never widely sold; first acquirer of Cyrix, later keeping only low-end IA-32 devices targeted for consumer System-on-a-chips, finally selling them to AMD

==Product discontinued/transformed==
* Harris Corporation – sold radiation-hardened versions of the 8086 and 80286; product line discontinued. Produced 20 MHz and 25 MHz 80286s (some motherboards were equipped with cache memory, which was unusual for 80286 processors).
* NEC – sold processors, such as NEC V20 and NEC V30, that were compatible with early Intel 16-bit architectures; product line transitioned to NEC-designed architectures.
* Siemens – sold versions of the 8086 and 80286; product line discontinued.
* V.M. Technology – developed VM860 (8086-compatible processor), VM8600SP (80286 compatibility with proprietary 32-bit extensions), and VM386SX+ (Intel 386SX pin compatible processor) for the Japanese market.
==Left the market or closed==
* Chips and Technologies – left market after failed 386 compatible chip failed to boot the Windows operating system
* IBM – Cyrix licensee and developer of Blue Lightning 486 line of processors, eventually left compatible chip market
* Rise Technology – after five years of working on the slow mP6 chip (released in 1998), the company closed a year later
* Texas Instruments and SGS-Thomson – licensees of Cyrix designs, eventually left compatible chip market
* Transmeta – transitioned to an intellectual property company in 2005
* United Microelectronics Corporation and Meridian Semiconductor – got out of market after a suit from Intel questioning the legality of copying Intel origin x86 microcode

==Incomplete/unsuccessful projects==
* Chromatic Research – media processor with x86 instruction set compatibility never completed
* Exponential Technology – x86-compatible microprocessor never completed
* S-MOS - 486-compatible project was canceled
* IIT Corp – 486-compatible project never completed
* International Meta Systems – Pentium/PPro-class processors &quot;Meta 6000&quot;, &quot;Meta 6500&quot;, &quot;Meta 7000/BiFrost&quot; never completed
* Texas Instruments - internally developed Pentium class processor was canceled in 1996
* MemoryLogix – multi-threaded CPU core &quot;MLX1&quot; and SOC for PCs never completed
* Metaflow Technologies – 486-class processor &quot;CP100&quot; never released
* Montalvo Systems – asymmetric multiprocessor never completed
* ULSI System Technology – never completed x86 SOC; company shut down after one of their employees was convicted for stealing Intel floating-point x87 design documents
* VLSI Technology - developed 386SX-based &quot;Polar&quot; SoC in collaboration with Intel - canceled due to low performance and lack of software support
* KAIST - developed but did not commercialize Intel-compatible processors HK386 and K486.
* Henry Wong - developed a 2-way superscalar, out-of-order execution, 32-bit x86 processor soft core running at over 200 MHz on Altera Stratix IV FPGA.

<text>Rajpath, officially named Kartavya Path (), and formerly known as Kingsway, is a ceremonial boulevard in New Delhi, India, that runs from Rashtrapati Bhavan on Raisina Hill through Vijay Chowk and India Gate, National War Memorial to National Stadium, Delhi. The avenue is lined on both sides by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees. Considered to be one of the most important roads in India, it is where the annual Republic Day parade takes place on 26 January. Janpath (meaning &quot;People&#x27;s Way&quot;) crosses the road. Rajpath runs in east-west direction. Roads from Connaught Place, the financial centre of Delhi, run into Rajpath from north. It was made during the Construction of New Delhi.

After climbing Raisina Hill, Rajpath is flanked by the North and South Blocks of the Secretariat Building. Finally it ends at the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan. At Vijay Chowk it crosses Sansad Marg, and the Parliament House of India can be seen to the right when coming from the India Gate.

It is also used for the funeral processions of key political leaders of India.

==Name and history==
In 1911 the British Imperial Government and the Viceregal administration determined that the capital of the British Indian Empire should be moved from Calcutta to Delhi. Accordingly, construction in that year began on the district of New Delhi, which would serve as the purpose-built administrative capital of the Indian Empire. The British Raj duly turned to Sir Edwin Lutyens to construct the new city. Lutyens conceived of a modern imperial city centred around a &quot;ceremonial axis&quot;, such axis being the large boulevard now called the Rajpath. Lutyens wanted a panoramic view of the city of Delhi from the viceregal palace. Consequently, the view from Raisina Hill runs unhindered across Rajpath and the India Gate, and is obstructed only by the National Stadium.

Most of the buildings surrounding the Rajpath were designed by Lutyens and the second architect of the project, Sir Herbert Baker and contracted by Sir Sobha Singh. The key function of such buildings in the government of India ensures the road&#x27;s importance. The first project was done in 1911 under Sujan Singh Hadaliwale, the Vijay Chowk, but it then halted due to the onset of the First World War.

===Name===

When built, the road was named King&#x27;s Way, or Kingsway, in honour of the Emperor of India George V, who had visited Delhi during the Durbar of 1911, and where the Emperor formally proclaimed the decision to move the capital. The name was similar to Kingsway in London, which had been opened in 1905, and which was also a custom-built arterial road, and which had been named in honour of George V&#x27;s father, Edward VII (as King of the United Kingdom).

Following the Independence of India the road was given its Hindi name, &#x27;Rajpath&#x27;, in place of its English designation. This represented a mere translation more than a substantial renaming, since &#x27;Rajpath&#x27; in Hindi is broadly analogous in meaning to &#x27;King&#x27;s Way&#x27;.

In September 2022, Rajpath was redeveloped under Central Vista Redevelopment Project and renamed Kartavya Path.

==Landmarks==
*The Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. It was the viceroy&#x27;s residence before Indian independence.
*North Block and South Block, also called the Secretariat Building. North Block houses the offices of Finance and Home ministries. South Block hosts External affairs and Defense ministries. Other important offices like some of the Prime Ministers Offices are also in the Secretariat Buildings.
*Vijay Chowk is a spacious plaza and the site of Beating the Retreat ceremony, which takes place on 29 January each year, which marks the end of Republic Day celebrations, in which Military Bands, Pipes and Drums Bands, Buglers and Trumpeters from various Army Regiments besides bands of the Navy and Air Force take part, with the President of India as the Chief Guest.
*India Gate is India&#x27;s war memorial arch in honour of those who died in the First World War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is also India&#x27;s memorial of the unknown soldier.
*National War Memorial, built to honour and remember soldiers of the Indian military who fought in armed conflicts of independent India. Since Independence, more than 25,000 soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces have been killed in various conflicts, humanitarian assistance and disaster response operations.

==Redevelopment==

The Central Vista Redevelopment Project started construction on 4 February 2021 and is planned to be finished in 2026 in phases.

On 8 September 2022, the redeveloped Boulevard was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A number of new features like planned landscapes, lawns with walkways, green spaces, refurbished canals, amenity blocks, improved signages and vending kiosks, new pedestrian underpasses, improved parking spaces, new exhibition panels, and upgraded night lighting were added. 
New sustainability features like solid waste management, storm-water management, recycling unit, rainwater harvesting, water conservation and energy efficient lighting systems were implemented. Foldable seats were added for the annual Republic Day parade.

<text>Jeremiah Trotter (born January 20, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons. He played college football for the Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks and was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft.

Trotter is one of just four linebackers in Eagles history to earn four or more Pro Bowl invitations, joining Chuck Bednarik, Maxie Baughan, and Bill Bergey in that select group. Trotter has also been a member of the Washington Redskins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

==Early life==
Trotter attended Hooks High School in Hooks, Texas and was a letterman in football. In football, he was a three-time all district honoree and was named the District MVP as a senior.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles (first stint)===
Trotter was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft. In his first year with the Eagles as a backup, he recorded only six tackles. In his second season, newly hired Head Coach Andy Reid named Trotter the starting middle linebacker. Over the next three seasons, he led the team in tackles. In four seasons with the Eagles, he had accumulated 361 tackles, nine sacks, five interceptions and four forced fumbles. He also made two straight Pro Bowls in the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

Trotter and the Eagles defense ranked second in the NFL in 2001, earning them their first NFC East championship since 1988. The Eagles would go to the NFC Championship that year for the first time since 1980, but lost to the St. Louis Rams. Following the loss, Trotter became a free agent. He was designated with the franchise tag by the Eagles, but after failing to agree on a contract, became a free agent.

===Washington Redskins===
Trotter signed a seven-year, $36 million contract with the Washington Redskins on April 19, 2002. On June 1, 2004, after just two seasons into his contract, Trotter was released. In his two seasons with the Redskins, Trotter recorded over 200 tackles and 1.5 sacks.

===Philadelphia Eagles (second stint)===
Trotter returned to the Eagles for the 2004 season, signing a one-year contract worth the veteran minimum.

Prior to re-signing Trotter, the Eagles run defense was among the worst in the NFL. Trotter became the starter midway through the 2004 season, and immediately improved the defense. That year, the Eagles advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1980, marking Trotter&#x27;s first appearance in the championship game, though they would lose by a narrow margin to the defending champion New England Patriots, 24–21. At the end of the season, Trotter re-signed with the Eagles to a five-year contract worth $15 million, opting to return despite a larger contract offer from Kansas City.

During the 2005 season opener, about 40 minutes before kickoff between the Eagles and Atlanta Falcons, Trotter and Falcons&#x27; cornerback Kevin Mathis got into a fight during pregame warmups. After officials reviewed video to see who instigated the fight, both Trotter and Mathis were ejected before kickoff. Terry Bradshaw said about the incident, &quot;No one&#x27;s been thrown out of a house that fast since my last divorce&quot;. The fight led to an NFL rules change where non-kickers cannot enter a neutral zone between the 45-yard-lines prior to the game.

Trotter was voted to the Pro Bowl in 2005, being the only Eagle to be voted outright by the fans that season (Brian Dawkins was named to the Pro Bowl as an alternate). He was once again named to the Pro Bowl in 2006. On August 21, 2007, the Philadelphia Eagles released the veteran linebacker from the remainder of his second contract. The position of middle linebacker was filled by two-year veteran Omar Gaither.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
On September 3, 2007, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Trotter to a one-year deal.

===Philadelphia Eagles (third stint)===
After Stewart Bradley tore his ACL during training camp, the Eagles needed an experienced middle linebacker to take his place for the season. Trotter worked out on September 25, 2009, with the Eagles and signed a one-year contract. The following offseason, after allowing Brian Dawkins to leave via free agency, the Eagles cut ties with most of their NFC Championship squad, by trading Donovan McNabb, releasing Brian Westbrook, and not re-signing Trotter.

==Business ventures==
Trotter has been involved in various business ventures in addition to his football career. In 2000, he opened a salon called T&amp;I Unisex Salon, located in Willingboro, New Jersey. In 2003, Trotter opened a car wash business called Trott&#x27;s Spot Car Wash, located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and he also owns two car washes in neighboring Voorhees. The car wash in Cherry Hill, New Jersey has since closed down.

==Personal life==

Trotter was married to Tammi Trotter (née Johnson), who died on February 28, 2023. The couple had three children. Trotter is a Christian. While playing with the Eagles, Trotter was a resident of Hainesport, New Jersey.

Trotter&#x27;s two sons, Jeremiah Jr. and Josiah, each played linebacker in high school at St. Joseph&#x27;s Preparatory School in Philadelphia. Jeremiah Jr. played college football for the Clemson Tigers, and was drafted by the Eagles in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL draft. Josiah currently plays college football for the Missouri Tigers. 

Trotter was captain of the Philadelphia Benjamins dodgeball team on the 3rd season of GSN&#x27;s Extreme Dodgeball.
Trotter made his acting debut in 2013 in the independent film &quot;The North Star&quot;.

Trotter was inducted into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame on November 28, 2016.

Trotter is the uncle of former St. Louis Rams running back Terrance Ganaway.

<doc id="990322" wikidata="Q4127328" url="?curid=990322" title="Bolo universe">
<text>The &quot;Bolo&quot; universe is a fictional universe based on a series of military science fiction books by author Keith Laumer. It primarily revolves around the eponymous &quot;Bolo&quot;, a type of self-aware tank. They first appeared in the short story &quot;Combat Unit&quot; (1960), and have since been featured in science fiction novels and short story anthologies by him and others.

==Themes==
The story of the books takes place in various times from the near-future (2018, 2068), the mid-range future (27th up to 37th century) and even farther in one case (118th century). The overall plot features mostly military themes and includes space exploration, alien races and some advances in human society.

Many Bolo stories are told from the point of view of the Bolo itself, with its internal thoughts printed in italics throughout the text.

One theme in Bolo works is the portrayal of valiant, tragic, self-sacrificing heroes, such as Bolo &quot;Nike&quot; in the story &quot;Miles to Go&quot; (Weber 1995, in Bolos Book III). Another concept explored by stories such as &quot;Miles to Go&quot; is the use (and abuse) of safeguards to prevent artificial intelligence from hurting its creators.

Their overall programming involves large amounts of human military history, and often they draw conclusions from that information which puts them at odds with their commanders. Sometimes Bolos develop senses of honor and nobility that would bring their actions into conflict with orders given by their human superiors. One of the stories in Rogue Bolo chronicles the actions of Combat Unit CSR, who identifies an alien threat to humanity but is forced to go &quot;rogue&quot; in order to defeat it (possibly for dramatic effect, as it does not appear to be explained why the bolo did not simply inform its commanders of the threat).

==Description==
Bolos as envisioned by Laumer in his future history military SF are described as autonomous armoured fighting vehicles of immense size. 
While the early versions are in the range of a few hundred tons, the &quot;Mark XXXIII&quot;, a standard model appearing in the series, weighs 32,000 tons:
* Their increasingly complex AI: Where first models are controlled by programming intended to reduce the need for a human crew, later models mimic human thought patterns, feature strong AIs and finally &quot;Psychotronic circuitry&quot;, enabling self-awareness, strategic planning and decision-making, and even conscience.
* Minimized human crew, often consisting only of a single human commander who can either directly control all aspects of his unit thanks to an advanced interface, or who communicates with his unit, giving it instructions to carry out.

===Offensive systems===
Weapon systems described as part of early Bolo marks include mostly real-world weaponry; the more futuristic settings of the novels describe them carrying advanced nuclear weapons. The main gun of a Bolo is usually a variant of the &quot;Hellbore&quot; system which is described in the Bolo story-universe as a long-range deuterium-initiated fusion pulse. &quot;Hellbores&quot; were meant as weapons for interstellar vessels, and the versions mounted on Bolos were modified to fit.

Secondary weapons cover a wide field of weapon systems, as Bolos were supposed to address most combat situations, including land, sea and air battles, sometimes including space/orbit. While Bolo models generally opted for a &quot;balanced&quot; approach to offensive and defensive capabilities, there were often specialised variations on the base model, such as heavy siege units, scout units and ECM platforms. The additional weaponry thus includes but isn&#x27;t restricted to: A high-speed auto-cannon which was recurringly referred to as &quot;Infinite Repeaters&quot; (the &#x27;infinite&#x27; referring to the fact that the Bolo can create its own ammunition from metals found in the environment, thus not having an ammo count in the true sense of the word), firing systems such as a combination of Gatling guns with mortars similar to the 2S4 Tyulpan; VLS (also for launch of drones etc.); as well as tank guns or railguns similar to secondary armament, which includes additional &quot;Hellbores&quot; of a smaller caliber. Projectiles include KEP projectiles, &quot;DSFSLRP&quot; (futuristic APFSDS), other missiles and anti-personnel flechettes. Bolos may carry different types of drones (UAVs, hover-UGVs, even satellites) for maintenance, reconnaissance (sometimes including spy satellites) and providing additional offense.

===Defensive and other systems===
The armor of a Bolo unit is designed to withstand direct hits from all weapons, including in some of the stories nuclear weapons. The armor consists of composite materials that are named in the books as &quot;durachrome&quot;, &quot;flintsteel&quot;, &quot;duralloy&quot; and &quot;endurachrome&quot;. Many models would also use ablative or ceramic tiles to provide additional protection against plasma weapons.

Bolos are also described as having reactive armor (to stop penetrator missiles that could bore through their regular armor), and energy battlescreens; battlescreens convert an enemy weapon fire into energy which could then be redirected to the Bolo&#x27;s own systems and weapons. Also, beginning with the Mark XXIII, internal disruptor fields were added to limit damage to vital systems from any attacks which did manage to penetrate the Bolo&#x27;s outer defenses.

Each unit is also equipped with passive and active sensors, as well as stealth and ECW capabilities. Later Marks were often also equipped with FTL comm.

Power for weapons, battlescreens, and mobility is most often provided by one or more fission or fusion energy sources, in conjunction with high-capacity batteries which are used as secondary or emergency power supplies. A Bolo&#x27;s command center can remain operational for decades or centuries after reactor fuel is exhausted. As a last resort, Bolos may detonate their reactors to destroy an enemy, or prevent their capture.

===Artificial intelligence===
Early Bolo models are described as not self-aware artificial intelligences. Up to the Mark IX, they are only systems which automate the functioning of the vehicle under direct human command. Beginning with the Mark X, Bolos begin to use limited AI systems using pre-packaged battle plans which allows them to function relatively independently provided the situation on the battlefield falls within the parameters of its pre-loaded plan. If not, the human commander needs to directly intervene either selecting a new battle plan or taking over the functions of the Bolo personally. This system is further advanced beginning with the Mark XV-R which is given a basic AI core capable of choosing between various pre-loaded plans based upon actual battlefield conditions. However, what these earlier Bolos are not capable of doing is developing their own independent battle plans.

Beginning with the Mark XX, Bolos are equipped with a &quot;psychotronic brain&quot; which gives them artificial intelligence. Analogous to human minds, psychotronic brains do turn insane when damaged, which requires their creators to restrict the awareness and initiative at all times except during battle. This is accomplished by separating main processing from personality. The two are integrated (enabling the Bolo to come into possession of its full faculties) only when battle preconditions are met, such as the approach of an enemy or the order of a human officer. In later models, added redundancy reduces the likelihood of insanity and the restriction is relaxed to enhance intelligence. As a final safeguard, Bolos are equipped with a &quot;Total Systems Override Program&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Omega Worm&quot;) which erases the Bolo&#x27;s software, rendering it brain-dead. This is triggered if a Bolo refuses an authorized order or if executed by a human operator.

The cognitive inhibitions are completely removed after a review of the combat performance, at the &quot;Battle of Santa Cruz&quot; (c. A.D. 3030), of experimental unit &quot;23/B-0075-NKE&quot; (&quot;Nike&quot;). &quot;Nike&quot;&#x27;s performance demonstrates the capabilities and reliability of fully autonomous psychotronics. &quot;Nike&quot; herself dies by &quot;Omega Worm&quot; as a result of refusing to obey an officer who is a traitor. This leads to a revision of the parameters for execution of &quot;Omega Worm&quot; in later model Bolos.

Beginning with the Mark XXV models, Bolos become completely autonomous, capable of full self-direction in all situations. However, it is found that the intuitive capabilities of human commanders working in conjunction with intelligent Bolos increases the effectiveness of the units and so, with some exceptions, human commanders continue to be assigned to, fight with and if necessary, die with their Bolos. This partnership is further enhanced with the introduction of the Mark XXXII which pioneers a neural interface which allows the Bolo and its human commander to mentally merge human intuition and Bolo processing speed.

====Computing design structure====
Most later mark Bolos have several processing centers, the main core, the personality center, the damage control core (in later models) and the survival center. Some Bolos are given a secondary main core, but this was not typical. Of these, the survival center is the most heavily protected. In the event of the destruction of the Bolo, the survival center is designed to protect the Bolo&#x27;s core personality and programming for later retrieval and reactivation.

Each Bolo contains several computer &quot;cores&quot; with different functions, each of which contains multiple fully functional duplicates in case of failure. If a Bolo&#x27;s logic becomes dysfunctional enough, it regresses to the original &quot;Resartus protocol&quot;, which is embedded in all self-aware models just for such a case, which essentially shuts down the Bolo&#x27;s &quot;mind&quot;.

====Safeguards====
A key factor in Bolo psychotronic design is the need to address public and military concern over the potential catastrophe which could be unleashed in the event of a Bolo disobeying orders or being suborned. To mitigate this, a number of safeguards are included in the psychotronic design—specifically a focus on loyalty, honour and a strong sense of duty, as well as a restriction on the level of awareness and processing power made available to the Bolo outside of combat. These safeguards often combine with the prejudices of ranking officers to cause the unnecessary destruction of a Bolo during combat. With Bolos being able to survive for centuries, older Marks often end up scattered across the galaxy abandoned on old warfields or retrofitted for use in farming or heavy construction. On several occasions obsolete Bolos go rogue, causing significant destruction, loss of life and bad publicity for the &quot;Dinochrome Brigade&quot;: as a result, a special unit was set up to find all such units and burn out their control centers.

On several occasions, Bolos have turned against their commanders during combat: in &quot;Bolo!&quot;, a damaged Mark XXV (Unit LNC/Lance) loses its IFF capability, causing it to attack a fellow Bolo. Similarly, a Mark XXXIII (Unit HCT/Hector) was subverted by an alien AI and turned into a prison guard in &quot;Bolo Rising&quot;. Conversely, Bolos have occasionally refused to carry out illegal, treasonous, or dishonourable orders, such as Unit NKE (Nike) in &quot;The Triumphant&quot; or Unit SOL (Surplus On Loan) in &quot;The Road to Damascus&quot;.

===Command structure and deployment===
Bolos and their human commanders are assigned to an elite &quot;Concordiat&quot; unit called the &quot;Dinochrome Brigade&quot;, which traces its lineage back to various units on Earth. Individual Bolos are generally identified by a three-letter prefix which is generally extrapolated into a given name—this name is generally used as the default access code for a new commander. Often, Bolos on garrison duty are described as older surplus or reserve units on loan, in which case their three-letter prefix is changed to &quot;SOL&quot;.
Bolos are generally deployed in groups to provide fire support, though individual units are occasionally detached to perform garrison duty—later marks of Bolo are considered to be so capable that a single unit can be assigned to guard an entire planet, even during periods when a human commander is not available. When deployed by the Dinochrome Brigade for major combat operations, Bolos usually serve with &quot;Planetary Siege Regiments&quot;. Before the development of higher marks of Bolos, powerful enough to often allow a single Bolo to conduct major planetary operations without support, the regiments are only called &quot;siege regiments&quot;.

==Fictional history==
Laumer included a history of the Bolo as an appendix to one of his books. The &quot;Mark I&quot; is described as conventional large (150 tonne) tank equipped with various servos and mechanical devices to reduce crew requirements. It is developed around the year 2000 by the fictional Bolo Division of General Motors.

By the time of the development of the 300-tonne Mark III, its AI allows limited independent action, and is powered by &quot;ionic&quot; batteries able to support combat-level activity for up to ten years and enabling operation even when fully submerged.

The AI increases until the incorporation of Psychotronic circuitry in the Mark XX leads to Bolos becoming self-aware and capable of fully independent operation. The Mark XXVI is described as capable of true independent strategic planning, while the final standardised Bolo, the 32,000-tonne Mark XXXIII is described as fully self-willed and able to operate indefinitely without external support.

As humanity spreads beyond Earth, Bolos are used to protect first &quot;the Empire&quot;, and then the &quot;Concordiat of Man&quot;. For millennia, each successive mark of Bolo proves to be the lynchpin of humanity&#x27;s ground-based defenses, especially in the numerous and protracted wars against various aliens, most notably the &quot;Deng&quot; and the &quot;Melconians&quot; in the 30th century. Bolos are also used in smaller scale raids, skirmishes and internal conflicts between warring human parties.

The Mark XXXIII Bolo is the last standard Bolo built by the &quot;Concordiat&quot; prior to the &quot;Melconian&quot; destruction of Earth. Following the genocide of the &quot;Final War&quot; with the &quot;Melconians&quot;, surviving Bolos are described as crucial in sheltering and protecting the few scattered remnants of humanity during the long slow process of rebuilding. A number of &quot;seed corn&quot; colonies survive the genocide policies carried out by both sides and go on to produce new models of Bolo: these are even larger in size, design and capabilities.

==Species introduced in the Bolo Universe==
==Books==
Bolos appear in these books by Keith Laumer and others; almost all published by Baen Books:

===Keith Laumer stories (1970s–1990)===

* (also known as simply Bolo) - anthology of short stories previously published in magazines such as &quot;Analog&quot;
* 
* - includes &quot;Bolo&quot; and &quot;Rogue Bolo&quot;

===Anthologies (1990s–2002)===

==In other media==
The Bolo stories inspired the board game &quot;Ogre&quot;, whose creators originally intended to license the stories. For cost reasons this did not occur and a different background was invented for the game, with its titular tank deliberately being made self-unaware in order to differentiate it.

===Video games===

<text>GameSpot is an American video gaming website that provides news, reviews, previews, downloads, and other information on video games. The site was launched on May 1, 1996, created by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein. In addition to the information produced by &quot;GameSpot&quot; staff, the site also allows users to write their own reviews, blogs, and post on the site&#x27;s forums. It has been owned by Fandom, Inc. since October 2022.

In 2004, &quot;GameSpot&quot; won &quot;Best Gaming Website&quot; as chosen by the viewers in Spike TV&#x27;s second &quot;Video Game Award Show&quot;, and has won Webby Awards several times. The domain &quot;GameSpot.com&quot; attracted at least 60 million visitors annually by October 2008 according to a Compete.com study.

==History==
In January 1996, Pete Deemer, Vince Broady, and Jon Epstein quit their positions at IDG and founded SpotMedia Communications. SpotMedia then launched &quot;GameSpot&quot; on May 1, 1996. Originally, &quot;GameSpot&quot; focused solely on personal computer games, so a sister site, &quot;VideoGameSpot&quot;, was launched on December 1, 1996. Eventually &quot;VideoGameSpot&quot;, then renamed &quot;VideoGames.com&quot;, was merged into &quot;GameSpot&quot;. On January 6, 1997, SpotMedia and publisher Ziff Davis announced a $20 million agreement allowing the publisher to run content from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; on SpotMedia&#x27;s websites. By the following month, Ziff Davis&#x27;s substantial financial infusion enabled &quot;GameSpot&quot; to grow to 45 employees. In February 1999, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; named &quot;GameSpot&quot; one of the hundred best websites, alongside competitors &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;. On July 19, 2000, CNET announced its acquisition of ZDNET, putting &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Gamecenter&quot; under the same parent company. That December, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Gamecenter&quot; the &quot;&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; of gaming sites&quot;. In February 2001, &quot;GameSpot&quot; was spared from a redundancy reduction effort by CNET which shuttered &quot;Gamecenter&quot;.

In October 2005, &quot;GameSpot&quot; adopted a new design similar to that of TV.com, now considered a sister site to &quot;GameSpot&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; ran a few different paid subscriptions from 2006 to 2013, but is no longer running those. In June 2008, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s parent company CNET was acquired by CBS Corporation, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; along with CNET&#x27;s other online assets were managed by the CBS Interactive division.

A new layout change was adopted in October 2013.

CNET was sold to Red Ventures in October 2020. Two years later, Fandom acquired &quot;GameSpot&quot;, along with Metacritic, TV Guide, GameFAQs, Giant Bomb, Cord Cutters News, and Comic Vine from Red Ventures. In January 2023, 40-50 employees were affected by a round of layoffs. More layoffs at GameSpot took place in January 2024.

===International history===
&quot;GameSpot UK&quot; (United Kingdom) was started in October 1997 and operated until mid-2002, offering content that was oriented for the British market that often differed from that of the U.S. site. During this period, &quot;GameSpot UK&quot; won the 1999 PPAi (Periodical Publishers Association interactive) award for best website, and was short listed in 2001. &quot;PC Gaming World&quot; was considered a &quot;sister print magazine&quot; and some content appeared on both &quot;GameSpot UK&quot; and &quot;PC Gaming World&quot;. Following the purchase of ZDNet by CNET, GameSpot UK was merged with the main US site. On April 24, 2006, &quot;GameSpot UK&quot; was relaunched.

In a similar fashion, &quot;GameSpot AU&quot; (Australia) existed on a local scale in the late 1990s with Australian-produced reviews. It ceased in 2003. When a local version of the main CNET portal, CNET.com.au was launched in 2003, GameSpot AU content was folded into CNET.com.au. The site was fully re-launched in mid-2006, with a specialized forum, local reviews, special features, local pricings in Australian dollars, Australian release dates, and more local news.

===Gerstmann dismissal===
Jeff Gerstmann, editorial director of the site, was fired on November 28, 2007 as a result of pressure from Eidos Interactive, a major advertiser; Eidos objected to the 6/10 review that Gerstmann had given &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men&quot;, a game they were heavily advertising on &quot;GameSpot&quot; at the time. Both &quot;GameSpot&quot; and parent company CNET initially stated that his dismissal was unrelated to the review. However, in March 2012, the non-disclosure agreement that forced Gerstmann to withhold the details of his termination was nullified. Not long after, &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; (a site Gerstmann founded after leaving &quot;GameSpot&quot;) was being purchased by the same parent company as &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and that they moved their headquarters into the same building. As part of this announcement, Gerstmann revealed that the firing was indeed related to threats of Eidos pulling advertising revenue away from &quot;GameSpot&quot; as a result of Gerstmann&#x27;s poor review score, which was confirmed by &quot;GameSpot&#x27;s&quot; Jon Davison.

===Notable staff===
* Greg Kasavin – executive editor and site director of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, who left in 2007 to become a game developer. He became a producer at EA and 2K Games. As of 2021, he was working for Supergiant Games as a writer and creative director.
* Jeff Gerstmann – editorial director of the site, dismissed from &quot;GameSpot&quot; on November 28, 2007, for undisclosed reasons, after which he started &quot;Giant Bomb&quot;. Following the announcement of the purchase of &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; by CBS Interactive on March 15, 2012, Jeff was allowed to reveal that he was dismissed by management as a result of publishers threatening to pull advertising revenue due to less-than-glowing review scores being awarded by &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s editorial team.
* Danny O&#x27;Dwyer – video presenter of &quot;GameSpot&quot;, founded crowdfunded game documentary company Noclip in 2016.
* Chris Wanstrath – web developer of &quot;GameSpot&quot; who left in 2008 to start GitHub, which became the world’s largest host service for software code. In 2018 he sold GitHub to Microsoft for $7.5 billion.

==Community features==
&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s forums were originally run by ZDNet, and later by Lithium. &quot;GameSpot&quot; uses a semi-automated moderation system with numerous volunteer moderators. &quot;GameSpot&quot; moderators are picked by paid &quot;GameSpot&quot; staff from members of the &quot;GameSpot&quot; user community. Due to the size and massive quantity of boards and posts on &quot;GameSpot&quot;, there is a &quot;report&quot; feature where a normal user can report a violation post to an unpaid moderator volunteer.

In addition to the message board system, &quot;GameSpot&quot; has expanded its community through the addition of features such as user blogs (formerly known as &quot;journals&quot;) and user video blogs. Users can track other users, thus allowing them to see updates for their favorite blogs. If both users track each other, they are listed on each other&#x27;s friends list.

<doc id="990343" wikidata="Q841805" url="?curid=990343" title="Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra">
<text>In mathematical logic, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra (or Lindenbaum algebra) of a logical theory &quot;T&quot; consists of the equivalence classes of sentences of the theory (i.e., the quotient, under the equivalence relation ~ defined such that &quot;p&quot; ~ &quot;q&quot; exactly when &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are provably equivalent in &quot;T&quot;). That is, two sentences are equivalent if the theory &quot;T&quot; proves that each implies the other. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the quotient algebra obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this congruence relation.

The algebra is named for logicians Adolf Lindenbaum and Alfred Tarski. 
Starting in the academic year 1926-1927, Lindenbaum pioneered his method in Jan Łukasiewicz&#x27;s mathematical logic seminar, and the method was popularized and generalized in subsequent decades through work 
by Tarski.
The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern algebraic logic.

== Operations ==

The operations in a Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra &quot;A&quot; are inherited from those in the underlying theory &quot;T&quot;. These typically include conjunction and disjunction, which are well-defined on the equivalence classes. When negation is also present in &quot;T&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is a Boolean algebra, provided the logic is classical. If the theory &quot;T&quot; consists of the propositional tautologies, the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is the free Boolean algebra generated by the propositional variables.

If &quot;T&quot; is closed for deduction, then the embedding of &quot;T/~&quot; in &quot;A&quot; is a filter. Moreover, an ultrafilter in A corresponds to a complete consistent theory, establishing the equivalence between Lindenbaum&#x27;s Lemma and the Ultrafilter Lemma.

== Related algebras ==

Heyting algebras and interior algebras are the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras for intuitionistic logic and the modal logic S4, respectively.

A logic for which Tarski&#x27;s method is applicable, is called &quot;algebraizable&quot;. There are however a number of logics where this is not the case, for instance the modal logics S1, S2, or S3, which lack the rule of necessitation (⊢φ implying ⊢□φ), so ~ (defined above) is not a congruence (because ⊢φ→ψ does not imply ⊢□φ→□ψ). Another type of logic where Tarski&#x27;s method is inapplicable is relevance logics, because given two theorems an implication from one to the other may not itself be a theorem in a relevance logic. The study of the algebraization process (and notion) as topic of interest by itself, not necessarily by Tarski&#x27;s method, has led to the development of abstract algebraic logic.

<text>General John Charles Meyer (April 3, 1919 – December 2, 1975) was an American World War II flying ace, and later the commander-in-chief of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) and director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. SAC was the United States&#x27; major nuclear deterrent force with bombers, tankers and reconnaissance aircraft, and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff coordinated the nation&#x27;s nuclear war plans and developed the Single Integrated Operations Plan.

==Early life==
Meyer was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 3, 1919. He attended schools in New York and left Dartmouth to become an Aviation Cadet in 1939. After World War II, he graduated from Dartmouth College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political geography.

==Military career==
Meyer enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps in November 1939 in order to become a pilot. In July 1940 he was commissioned a second lieutenant and awarded pilot wings. Second Lieutenant Meyer was assigned to flight instructor duty at Randolph Field, Texas and Gunter Field, Alabama. He was then transferred to the 33rd Pursuit Squadron of the 8th Pursuit Group at Mitchel Field, New York to fly the Curtiss P-40. During the tense days before the United States entered World War II, the Group was sent to Iceland, flying convoy patrol missions.

===World War II===
In September 1942 he was assigned to the newly formed 352nd Fighter Group at Westover, Massachusetts, where he, as a 1st Lieutenant, assumed command of the 34th Pursuit Squadron that had recently returned from the Philippines in name only and was in need of new equipment and personnel. By the end of December, Meyer had received most of the ground personnel and had twenty six pilots assigned, but had no aircraft. In January, the unit moved to New Haven, Connecticut, and began picking up the first Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters that it would take to combat. The 34th was redesignated as the 487th Fighter Squadron in May 1943 prior to receiving orders to deploy to England.

Captain Meyer took the 487th Fighter Squadron to its new base at RAF Bodney in East Anglia and into combat, scoring its first victory in November. By then he had been promoted to major and began leading the group in aerial victories. He continued to score against German fighters and remain a leading ace after the 352nd transitioned to the North American P-51 Mustang and adopted their famous &quot;Blue Noses&quot;. By November 1944 he was deputy commander of the 352nd Fighter Group and the fourth highest scoring American ace in Europe with 24 confirmed air-to-air victories and 13 destroyed on the ground.

In December Meyer, as a Lieutenant Colonel, deployed with the 352nd to a forward base in Belgium designated &quot;Y-29&quot;. His foresight in having the 487th squadron preflighted and ready to take off on 1 January averted a major disaster when the field was attacked by fighters of Jagdgeschwader 11 in the massive aerial assault known as Operation Bodenplatte. Meyer led the takeoff under fire and scored against a strafing Focke-Wulf Fw 190 before his landing gear retracted earning a Distinguished Service Cross that day.

Later, a vehicle accident left him with a severe leg injury thereby ending his combat flying with the 352nd after flying 200 combat missions with 462 combat flying hours and scoring 24 aerial victories with another 13 credited to ground strafing.

===Postwar assignments===
In 1948, Meyer was selected as the Secretary of the Air Force&#x27;s principal point of contact with the United States House of Representatives.

===Korean War===
Meyer then returned to a tactical flying unit in August 1950 when he assumed command of the 4th Fighter Wing at New Castle, Delaware. He took the North American F-86 Sabre jet wing to Korea where it flew in the First United Nations Counteroffensive and Chinese Communist Forces Spring Offensive campaigns.

On December 22, 1950, Meyer, led a flight of eight F-86 Sabres against 15 MiG-15s in the first major all-jet fighter battle in history. The flight downed six MiGs without sustaining any losses.

During the war, he destroyed two MiG-15 aircraft, bringing his total of enemy aircraft destroyed (air and ground) in both World War II and Korean War to 39½.

===Postwar assignments===
After a tour of duty as Director of Operations for Air Defense Command and Continental Air Defense Command, General Meyer graduated from the Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in June 1956, and was retained as an instructor at the college. He was then assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC) where he commanded two air divisions in the Northeast United States. In July 1962 he moved to SAC headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, as the deputy director of plans, and also served as the commander-in-chief of SAC&#x27;s representative to the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff.

In November 1963 General Meyer assumed command of the Tactical Air Command&#x27;s Twelfth Air Force with headquarters at James Connally AFB in Waco, Texas. Twelfth Air Force provided tactical air units for joint logistic and close air support training with Army ground units stationed in the western half of the United States. In February 1966 he was assigned to the Organization of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff where he served first as deputy director and then vice director of the Joint Staff. In May 1967 he became the director of operations on the Joint Staff.

Meyer became 12th Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on 1st August 1969, remaining in that post until 30th April 1972. On May 1, 1972, he became the seventh commander-in-chief of the Strategic Air Command, and the director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff. As commander of SAC from 1972 to 1974, he directed Operation Linebacker II, the &#x27;Christmas Bombing&#x27; of North Vietnam.

On January 3, 1973, general Meyer visited Andersen Air Base on Guam, on a morale-boosting trio after The &#x27;Christmas Bombing&#x27; had placed heavy strains on the morale and cohesion of the B-52 bomber squadrons. In a Q&amp;A session with crews, Meyer&#x27;s answers prompted such anger among the airmen, that some walked out in disgust, while other pelted the general with coke cans and furniture. In &quot;Vietnam - An Epic Tragedy&quot; historian Max Hastings describes it as one of the most extraordinary episodes in the history of SAC.

==Later life==
Meyer died of a heart attack on December 2, 1975, and was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

In 1988, Meyer was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

==Awards and decorations==
Meyer&#x27;s military decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Silver Star with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with six oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with 14 oak leaf clusters, Croix de Guerre with palm from both France and Belgium. In March 1973 be received the Frank Hawks Memorial Award for his many contributions to aviation. He retired July 1, 1974.

On this date, Lieutenant Colonel Meyer was leading his squadron of P-51 fighters and was proceeding to rendezvous with a task force of heavy bombers, when he observed approximately thirty hostile aircraft forming up near the bomber track. He promptly led his squadron in an attack on the enemy formation and succeeded in scattering it into ones and twos. With the enemy separated, his squadron proceeded to engage them with great tenacity. Lieutenant Colonel Meyer sent one enemy plane crashing to the ground and found himself separated entirely from his squadron. At this time he observed about fifteen enemy aircraft preparing to engage the bombers. Without regard to the superior enemy numbers, he unhesitatingly attacked the enemy formation without support of any kind, and destroyed three of them. The formation was dispersed and any possible attack on the bombers frustrated. The outstanding heroism and devotion to duty displayed by Lieutenant Colonel Meyer on this occasion are in keeping with the highest traditions of the Armed Forces of the United States.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation (3rd Award)===

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel (Air Corps) John Charles Meyer, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-51 Fighter Airplane and as Deputy Commander, 352d Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 1 January 1945. On this date, to save the airfield and ground personnel from extensive damage by a surprise enemy strafing attack, Colonel Meyer unhesitatingly led his squadron off the field in the face of an attacking force of approximately fifty hostile fighters, and engaged the enemy as they initiated their first strafing run. Despite the enemy&#x27;s great tactical advantage in numbers and position, and although his own aircraft was burdened with loaded wing tanks and its maneuverability greatly reduced, Colonel Meyer viciously engaged the enemy formation, personally destroying two of their aircraft. His valiant action in the face of extreme danger unquestionably saved the airfield from great damage. The extraordinary heroism and complete disregard for his personal safety displayed by Colonel Meyer on this occasion reflect highest credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the United States.

<doc id="990353" wikidata="Q3907285" url="?curid=990353" title="Polyculturalism">
<text>Polyculturalism is an ideological approach to the consequences of intercultural engagements within a geographical area which emphasises similarities between, and the enduring interconnectedness of, groups which self-identify as distinct, thus blurring the boundaries which may be perceived by members of those groups.

The concept of polyculturalism was first proposed by Robin Kelley and Vijay Prashad. It differs from multiculturalism which instead emphasises the separateness of the identities of self-identifying cultural groups with an aim of preserving and celebrating their differences in spite of interactions between them. Supporters of polyculturalism oppose multiculturalism, arguing that the latter&#x27;s emphasis on difference and separateness is divisive and harmful to social cohesion.

Polyculturalism was the subject of the 2001 book &quot;Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting: Afro-Asian Connections and the Myth of Cultural Purity&quot; by Vijay Prashad.

==Comparison of cultural ideologies==


Like advocates of multiculturalism, proponents of polyculturalism encourage individuals to learn about different cultures, especially those they may come into contact with in their own areas. However whereas multiculturalism advocates for toleration between members of distinctly different cultures groups, polyculturalism is less rigid and acknowledges that individuals shape their own identities and may choose to change so as to express their culture in a different way to their own ancestors, either by adding elements of other cultures to it or by eliminating aspects of it.

Polyculturalism views the concept of race as a social construct with no scientific basis, however it recognises the concept of ethnicity, considering ethno-nationalism a barrier which must be transcended in the pursuit of a dynamic community culture.

Critics of multiculturalism argue that it entrenches identity politics while polyculturalism aims to forge a common new identity

Polyculturalism acknowledges that cultures are dynamic, interactive and impure while multiculturalism treats them as static, isolated and complete.

==Examples of polycultural states ==

=== Revolutionary France=== 
The different successive polities over the last two centuries in France has tried various policies in intercultural relations, creating much research material for Citizenship Studies.

The French Revolution was ground-breaking in its de-emphasis of religious and other cultural distinctions. On 27 August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. On 27 September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly voted to give France’s Jewish population equal rights under the law. That a long-scapegoated minority were to be recognised simply as citizens regardless of their religion was unprecedented in Modern Europe.

Debates about citizenship, equality, and representative politics among intellectuals defined the Age of Enlightenment, and played a role in the shaping of political thinking in early America and France on the eve of the Revolution in 1789. Radical components of the Republican movement in France coalesced around the Jacobin Club in early 1790. One of their objectives was: 
To work for the establishment and strengthening of the constitution in accordance with the spirit of the preamble (that is, of respect for legally constituted authority and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen).

The political views of the Jacobin Movement were rooted in Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s notion of the social contract. The promotion and inculcation of civic values and the sense of nationhood became consolidated in France. A common identity for the peoples within France’s natural boundaries of the Alps, Jura mountains, Pyrenees, the river Rhine and the Atlantic coast was successfully cultivated and propagated. France’s regional identities were presented as parts of a wider whole in an effort to create common bonds across a much larger territorial area.

=== Socialist Yugoslavia=== 
In the new socialist countries that arose in the 20th century religious and other cultural distinctions were played down in an effort to promote a new shared common citizenship. The capacity to satisfactorily facilitate cultural autonomy in poly-ethnic societies without reinforcing divisions and thereby weaken the state had exorcised socialist intellectuals from as far back as Otto Bauer in his 1907 book &quot;The Nationalities Question and Social Democracy&quot;.

Edvard Kardelj, the constitutional architect of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, had set out to delicately de-escalate the often fractious &#x27;national question&#x27; in the Balkans. The 1946 Yugoslav Constitution was heavily influenced by the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, another poly-ethnic socialist state. Kardelj pointed out: &quot;For us the model was the Soviet Constitution, since the Soviet federation is the most positive example of the solution of relations between peoples in the history of Mankind.&quot;

The development of a Yugoslav socialist consciousness was further clarified in the 1953 Constitutional Law. The law referred to &quot;all power in the FPRY belongs to the working people&quot;. The emphasis on class was an obvious effort to supersede individual ethnic and religious differences. The constitutional changes were explained by the gathering development of new &quot;unified Yugoslav community&quot;.

In the practise of socialist self-management the establishment of a powerful body like the Council of Producers () instead of a Council of Nationalities appeared to confirm the post-nationalist atmosphere the populations of Yugoslavia had entered.

The developing moves from a Yugoslav citizenship to a Yugoslav ethnicity was greatly aided by the mutual comprehensibility of many of the ethnic groups in the region. Even after Yugoslavia was dismantled there is much agreement about this shared linguistic heritage as can be seen in the Declaration on the Common Language.

<text>The Rocas Atoll ( ) is the only atoll in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Norte. It is located approximately northeast of Natal and west of the Fernando de Noronha archipelago. The atoll is of volcanic origin and coralline formation.

==Description==

The oval atoll is long and wide. The lagoon is up to deep and has an area of . The land area of the two islets (Cemitério Island, southwest and Farol Cay, northwest) is . Farol Cay accounts for almost two-thirds of the aggregate area. The highest point is a sand dune in the south of larger Farol Cay, with a height of . Both islets are overgrown with grasses, bushes and a few palm trees. The population consists of crabs, spiders, scorpions, sand fleas, beetles, large roaches, and many species of birds.

There is a lighthouse of the Brazilian Navy that has been in operation and maintained since the 1960s, at the Northern end of Farol Bay. In its vicinity is a derelict lighthouse from 1933.

The atoll is a wildlife sanctuary, and in 2001 was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site because of its importance as a feeding ground for marine life. Numerous turtles, sharks, dolphins and birds live in the area. The atoll consists mainly of coral and red algae. The coral ring is almost closed, with a wide channel on the north side and a much narrower channel on the west side.

The atoll and surrounding waters are contained in the Atol das Rocas Biological Reserve. The reserve it is currently used solely for scientific research. Due to their remote location, the islands remain largely undisturbed by human activities. On the other hand, the remoteness also limits researchers&#x27; access to the islands and few studies have been developed on this atoll. The entomological fauna from Atol das Rocas have been recorded.

<doc id="990368" wikidata="Q1144827" url="?curid=990368" title="Currach">
<text>A currach ( ) is a type of Irish boat with a wooden frame, over which animal skins or hides were once stretched, though now canvas is more usual. It is sometimes anglicised as &quot;curragh&quot;.

The construction and design of the currach are unique to the west coasts of Ireland. It is referred to as a &quot;naomhóg&quot; in counties Cork, Waterford and Kerry and as a &quot;canoe&quot; in West Clare. It is similar to the coracle, though the two originated independently. The plank-built rowing boat found on the west coast of Connacht is also called a currach or &quot;curach adhmaid&quot; (&quot;wooden currach&quot;), and is built in a style very similar to its canvas-covered relative. Folk etymology has it that &quot;naomhóg&quot; means &quot;little holy one&quot;, &quot;little female saint&quot;, from &quot;naomh&quot;, Munster pronunciation &quot;saint, holy&quot;, and the feminine diminutive suffix &quot;-óg&quot;). Another explanation is that it comes from the Latin &quot;navis&quot;, and it has also been suggested that it derives from the Irish &quot;nae&quot;, a boat.

A larger version of this is known simply as a &quot;bád iomartha&quot; (rowing boat). It is suggested that the prototype of this wooden boat was built on Inishnee around 1900 and based upon a tender from a foreign vessel seen in Cleggan harbour. These wooden boats progressively supplanted the canvas currach as a workboat around the Connemara coast. This rowing currach measured up to 20 feet, and is still seen in water in North Donegal.

The currach has traditionally been both a sea boat and a vessel for inland waters. The River currach was especially well known for its shallow draft and manoeuvrability. Its framework was constructed of hazel rods and sally twigs, covered by a single ox-hide, which not only insulated the currach, but also helped dictate its shape. These currachs were common on the rivers of South Wales, and in Ireland were often referred to as Boyne currachs. However, when Ireland declared the netting of salmon and other freshwater fish illegal in 1948, it quickly fell out of use.

==History==
During the Neolithic period, the first settlers landed in the northern part of Ireland, likely arriving in boats that were the ancestors of the currach. Development in joining methods of wood during the Neolithic period made it possible to eventually create what the currach is today. Hide-covered basket origins are evident in currachs found in the east of Ireland, and 
using the skins for lining currachs in the Neolithic period likely was how the early Irish were able to make their way over to the Irish Isles.

The currach represents one of two traditions of boat and shipbuilding in Ireland: the skin-covered vessel and the wooden vessel. The flimsy construction of the former makes it unlikely that any remains would be available for the marine archaeologist, but its antiquity is clear from written sources.

One of these is the Latin account of the voyage of St Brendan (who was born c. 484 in the southwest of Ireland): &quot;Navigatio sancti Brendani abbatis&quot;. This contains an account of the building of an ocean-going boat: using iron tools, the monks made a thin-sided and wooden-ribbed vessel &quot;sicut mos est in illis partibus&quot; (&quot;as the custom is in those parts&quot;), covering it with hides cured with oak bark. Tar was used to seal the places where the skins joined. A mast was then erected in the middle of the vessel and a sail supplied. Though the voyage itself is essentially a wonder-tale, it is implied that the vessel as described was built in accordance with ordinary practice at the time. An Irish martyrology of the same period says of the Isle of Aran that the boat commonly used there was made of wickerwork and covered with cowhide.

Tim Severin constructed such a ship, following as best they could the Brendan descriptions and drawing on the skills and knowledge of a few traditional craftsmen, and showed that the result was quite seaworthy by sailing it from Ireland to the new world.

Gerald of Wales, in his &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot; (1187), relates that he was told by certain seamen that, having taken refuge from a storm off the coast of Connacht, they saw two men, long-haired and scantily clad, approaching in a slender wickerwork boat covered in skins. The crew found that the two spoke Irish and took them on board, whereupon they expressed amazement, never before having seen a large wooden ship.

The consistency in accounts from the early Middle Ages to the early modern period makes it likely that the construction and design of the currach underwent no fundamental change in the interval.

A 17th-century account in Latin by Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare of the Elizabethan wars in Ireland includes a description of two currachs built in haste to cross the River Shannon. The larger was constructed as follows: two rows of osiers were thrust in the ground opposite each other, the upper ends being bent in to each other (&quot;ad medium invicem reflexa&quot;) and tied with cords, whereupon the frame so made was turned upside down. Planks, seats and thwarts were then fitted inside (&quot;cui e solida tabula, statumina, transtraque interius adduntur&quot;), horse hide was fixed to the exterior and oars with rowlocks were supplied. This vessel is described as being able to carry 30 armed men at a time.

===Relationship with the coracle===
The currach bears a close resemblance to the coracle, a similar circular boat used in parts of the UK and to the wide family of circular boats termed &quot;coracles&quot; common throughout South and Southeast Asia. These non-Irish coracles all ultimately trace their origin to the quffa, a round Iraqi riverboat dating to the 9th century BCE, or possibly even as early as the 2nd millennium BCE. The resemblances between the currach and the coracle and quffa are a coincidence, however. British ethnologist James Hornell, who studied the currach, coracle, and quffa extensively during the early 20th century, believes that the currach was developed independently of the coracle and quffa in a case of multiple invention.

== Sea-going currachs, c. 17th century ==

The construction and sailing of a seagoing curach of the 17th century, a hybrid of the skin-covered and plank-built boat, was depicted in some detail by an Englishman, Captain Thomas Phillips: &quot;A portable vessel of wicker ordinarily used by the Wild Irish&quot;.

Though doubt has been cast on the accuracy of these sketches, they are detailed and represent a valid development of the ocean-going currach. The vessel is some twenty feet long: it possesses a keel and a rudder, with a ribbed hull and a mast amidship. Because of the keel, the craft is shown as being constructed from the bottom up. A covering (presumably of animal hides) was added, the sides being supported by rods in the interval.

The mast is supported by stays and by double shrouds on each side, the latter descending to an external shelf functioning as a chainwale. The forestay is shown as passing over a small fork above the yardarm, which supports a square sail: a branch is tied to the mast-top. The stern is surmounted by double half-hoops which could support a covering.

The sketches by Phillips imply that such a vessel was common in his day. The keel would improve the handling of the boat but the hull would remain flexible.

== Modern Irish currach ==

Currachs in general adhere to a plan designed to produce a sturdy, light and versatile vessel. The framework consists of latticework formed of rib-frames (&quot;hoops&quot;) and stringers (longitudinal slats), surmounted by a gunwale. There are stem and stern posts, but no keel. Thwarts are fitted, with knees supplied as required. Cleats or thole pins are fitted for the oars, and there may be a mast and sail, though with a minimum of rigging. The outside of the hull is covered by tarred canvas or calico, a substitute for animal hide.

Currachs were used in the modern period for fishing, for ferrying and for the transport of goods and livestock, including sheep and cattle.

Use of the currach was not continuous or universal along the Atlantic coast. In the modern period it did not reach Kerry (in the southwest of Ireland) until the late 19th century (c. 1880). Until then the only vessel used was the heavy wooden seine boat, which required eight men to row it. The Blasket Islanders found the currach (or &quot;naomhóg&quot;) particularly useful, and a distinctive regional type developed.

=== Oldbridge ===

The Irish River Currach is still being built in Oldbridge at river Boyne. Currachs produced here follow the same general construction process as many other Currach styles but in Boyne they implement the use of tarred canvas as the outer layer.

=== Donegal ===

Detailed plans are available for Donegal currachs.

The Donegal Sea Currach is very similar to the Boyne Currach in construction and style although the two are produced on opposite coasts from each other. The Donegal Sea Currach is the last traditional Irish craft to use the free paddle instead of the traditional oar.

=== Mayo ===

South Mayo currachs differ from most other currach types in that, instead of the stringers which elsewhere run outside the latticework frame, the bottom and sides are covered with a thin planking. In Achill Island the currach is built with double gunwales.

=== Connemara and the Islands ===

The Connemara currach is also distinguished by a double gunwale and by a particular form of pivoting block or &quot;bull&quot; attached to one side of the squared region of the loom of the oar.

The Aran islanders, like the Blasket islanders further south, were assiduous users of the curach. Unusually for the area a sail was used, though without shrouds or stays. Apart from the halliard, the only ropes were the tack, led to a point near the stem, and the sheet, carried aft and secured to the last thwart.

Currach races remain popular. In the mid-1950s and early 1960s the Seoighe cousins excelled by winning many county and All Ireland championships, including three in a row of the latter.

=== Clare ===

The Clare currach closely resembled that of the Aran Islands. In construction, a series of wooden markers were sunk into the ground at definite distances apart. These helped show the width desired for the lower gunwale frame. This was constructed first, followed by the upper frame, and the thwarts were then nailed into place.

=== Shannon ===

Currachs covered in cowhide were still common in the 1840s above Lough Ree, in the centre of Ireland. Thereafter they disappeared except at the seaward end of the Shannon Estuary.

=== Kerry ===

Kerry currachs had a reputation for elegance and speed. All were fitted for sailing, with a short mast without shrouds stepped in a socket in a short mast shoe. The halliard was rove through an iron ring near the masthead, hoisting a small lug sail, and this was controlled by a sheet and tack. When under sail lee-boards might be employed.

==== Currach builders ====

Currently there are few full-time currach builders. A notable exception are Meitheal Mara, who build currachs and train in currach building in Cork. They also organise currach-racing.

There has been a community-based enterprise in West Clare since 2005 called West Clare Currachs, with support from James Madigan of the Ilen School, Limerick. LNBHA, a community group on Lough Neagh, has made a number of Kerry naomhógs and Dunfanaghy and Tory Island currachs. In other counties on the western seaboard there are boat builders who sometimes make currachs.

== Scottish currachs ==
The traditional Scottish currach is nearly extinct, but there are occasional recreations. It is known to have been in use on the River Spey, in the north east, and also in the Hebrides.

=== St Columba ===
St Columba is said to have used a currach.

:&quot;On a day, at the end of two years from his arrival on Iona, Columba goes to the beach, where his craft of wicker and cowhide lies moored, waiting the use of any member of the community of Hy whose occasions may call him away from the island. He is accompanied by two friends and former fellow-students, Comgal and Cainnech, and followed by a little escort of faithful attendants. Taking his seat in his currach, he and his party are rowed across the sound to the mainland.&quot;

St Beccan of Rùm may have lived on the island for four decades from 632 AD, his death being recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; in 677. He wrote of Columba:

:In scores of curraghs with an army of wretches he crossed the long-haired sea.
:He crossed the wave-strewn wild region,
:Foam flecked, seal-filled, savage, bounding, seething, white-tipped, pleasing, doleful.

====Currachs in the River Spey====
In the &quot;Statistical Account of Scotland&quot; of 1795 we read of

:&quot;[a] man, sitting in what was called a Currach, made of hide, in the shape, and about the size of a small brewing-kettle, broader above than below, with ribs or hoops of wood in the inside, and a cross-stick for the man to sit on. . . . These currachs were so light, that the men carried them on their backs home from Speymouth.&quot;

The Spey currach would thus seem to be similar to the Welsh coracle in design, being used on a river rather than in the open sea. But twenty years earlier, we read of bigger ones, in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;History of the Province of Moray&quot; (1775):

:&quot;Let me add, as now become a Rarity, the Courach. . . . It is in shape oval, near three feet broad, and four long.&quot;

A more detailed description can be found in Scottish court records (1780):

:&quot;The currach contained only one man in working it, whereas the floats require two men and oars; and the man in the currach paddled with a shovel, one end of the rope being fixed to the raft, and the other tied to the man&#x27;s knee in the currach, which he let loose when there was any danger, the currach going before the raft.&quot;

Spey currachs were used in the timber trade there, as described in Ainslie&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage etc.&quot; (1822):

:&quot;The river taking a sudden bend, broadened and deepened into a wheel, on the breast of which a salmon cobble, or &quot;currach&quot; swam.

:&quot;Hence &quot;curracher&quot;, a man who sat in a &quot;currach&quot; and guided floating timbers down the Spey.&quot;

These may have survived into twentieth century; there is a reference to a &quot;currick&quot; in the &quot;Banffshire Journal&quot; (1926).

== Current use as racing boats ==
Currachs survive now as racing boats, often holding their own against much more modern types. In the annual London Great River Race, Currachs have regularly performed outstandingly in the Overall rankings (fastest boat on handicap), notably in 2007, 2008, and 2010.

A currach entered the inaugural Race to Alaska in 2015. The West Kerry &quot;naomhóg&quot;, with two Canadian crew members, attempted the 1,200 kilometre no-motor trip up the Inside Passage from Port Townsend, WA, to Ketchikan, AK.

Currach races are also performed at the Milwaukee Irish Fest. This event is held by the Irish Currach Club of Milwaukee in late August of every year and it features two races that are available for the public to view during the festival.

Currach races are also hosted in Albany, NY; Annapolis, MD; Boston, MA; Leetsdale, PA; New London, CT; Pittsburgh, PA and Philadelphia; PA as part of the North American Currach Association.

<doc id="990380" wikidata="Q3657246" url="?curid=990380" title="Goatman (urban legend)">
<text>According to urban legend, Goatman is a creature resembling a goat-human hybrid often credited with canine deaths and purported to take refuge in the woods of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States.

==History==
In May of 1971, University of Maryland student George Lizama completed an undergraduate folklore project on the Goatman that was later added to the Maryland Folklife Archives. In Lizama’s paper, the Goatman was said to be located on Tucker Road in Clinton, Maryland. Later the same year, reporter Karen Hosler discovered Lizama’s project in the Maryland Folklife Archives and reported on it in the &quot;Prince George’s County News&quot; in October 1971, this time placing the Goatman near Fletchertown Road in Bowie, Maryland. Additionally, this report covered the theory that the Goatman’s origins can be traced to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center.

While Goatman stories originated in the early 1970s, some of its legends are set in the late 1930s, within Prince George&#x27;s County, following the disappearances and/or deaths of multiple dogs, which were later attributed to the creature. However, given the condition of the remains, the deaths may more likely have been the result of passing trains. Despite evidence to the contrary, stories of Goatman&#x27;s existence continued to circulate, especially among local students. Graffiti reading &quot;Goatman was here&quot; were not uncommon, and law enforcement would habitually receive calls of reported sightings, albeit with a number being pranks.

The creature was commonly claimed to have a human face but with a body covered in hair. However, descriptions differed on whether Goatman greatly resembled a hairy humanoid or a human with the lower portion of a goat, similar to the fauns of Greek mythology.

As well, Goatman was rumored to reside in a makeshift shelter in the wooded region of northeastern Prince George&#x27;s County near the abandoned trailer parks. Occasionally, it was rumored that Goatman would venture out to kill any living thing such as animals, humans, etc .

==Variations==
According to some variations of the legend, Goatman is said to have once been a scientist, Dr. Stephen Fletcher, who worked in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. In this version, an experiment on goats backfires and the scientist mutates into a half man, half goat creature who begins aggressively attacking cars in the vicinity of Beltsville, Maryland. Another variation of the legend holds that Goatman himself was an old hermit who lived in the woods and often could be seen walking alone at night along Fletchertown Road.

According to University of Maryland folklorist Barry Pearson, the Goatman legends began &quot;long, long, long&quot; ago and were further popularized in 1971 when the death of a dog was blamed on Goatman by local residents. Pearson relates that &quot;bored teenagers&quot; keep the Goatman legend alive by repeating the story and suggesting that the creature attacks couples, frequenting the local lover&#x27;s lane, subsequently stirring interest in sites like Fletchertown Road.

<doc id="990390" wikidata="Q3731102" url="?curid=990390" title="Erastus Corning">
<text>Erastus Corning (December 14, 1794 – April 9, 1872) was an American businessman and politician from Albany, New York. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as mayor of Albany from 1834 to 1837, in the New York State Senate from 1842 to 1845, and in the United States House of Representatives from 1857 to 1859, and from 1861 to 1863.

A native of Norwich, Connecticut, Corning moved to Troy, New York, when he was 13 so he could be trained for a career as a merchant. He worked as a clerk in his uncle&#x27;s hardware store for six years, then moved to Albany, New York, to work for the retail business owned by James Spencer. Corning eventually became the senior partner in the enterprise, which he combined with businesses he inherited from his uncle to create Erastus Corning &amp; Co. The Corning company sold ironware, including tools and farm implements, nails, stoves, parts for railroad cars, and rails for railroads. John V. L. Pruyn married Corning&#x27;s niece Harriet, and Pruyn and Corning became partners in a variety of business ventures and investments. Under Corning&#x27;s leadership, several local and regional railways were combined in the early 1850s to form the New York Central Railroad, and Corning served as its first president.

Corning was involved in politics as a Democrat, and served as Albany&#x27;s mayor from 1834 to 1837. He was a member of the state senate from 1842 to 1845. In 1856 he was elected to Congress, and he served one term, 1857 to 1859. In 1860, he was again elected to the U.S. House, and he served a partial term, March 1861 to October 1863. Corning was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention and to the Peace Conference of 1861, which attempted to prevent the American Civil War. Though he was a Democrat and President Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, once the war started, Corning supported the Union while also criticizing what he viewed as the Lincoln administration&#x27;s excesses.

After leaving Congress, Corning began to wind down his business and political activities. He left the presidency of the New York Central in 1865, and focused much of his attention on speculating in and developing land he had purchased in the western states. He served as a delegate to the 1867 state constitutional convention. He died in Albany on April 8, 1872, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.

== Early life ==
Corning was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of Bliss Corning and Lucinda (Smith) Corning. At age two, Corning fell from his crib and injured a hip, which required him to walk with crutches. He was unable to walk unaided for more than a few steps, but this physical limitation was generally not referred to in the press. As an adult, he taught himself to walk with a cane, which enabled him to rely less on his crutches.

Corning attended academies in Norwich and Chatham, New York, and moved to Troy, New York, at the age of thirteen to clerk in the hardware store of his uncle, Benjamin Smith. Six years later he moved to Albany, New York, where he joined the mercantile business of James Spencer. After some time at Spencer&#x27;s firm, Corning became a partner, and the senior partner upon Spencer&#x27;s death in 1824. Corning combined the Spencer firm with holdings he inherited from his uncle to form Erastus Corning &amp; Co. John V. L. Pruyn was married to Harriet Corning Turner, who was Erastus Corning&#x27;s niece. As a result of this family connection, Corning and Pruyn were often partners in business ventures and investments, which grew to include insurance, banking, land speculation, and land development.

==Erastus Corning &amp; Co.==

Erastus Corning &amp; Co. bought and sold all types iron products, including tools, nails, stoves, farming implements, and eventually railroad track rails and railroad car parts. The company had a wharf and warehouse on the Hudson River in Albany, and the store served not only Albany and the surrounding towns, but hundreds of large customers from the west who visited Albany only two or three times a year to buy and sell products, restock their own supplies, and see what new items were for sale.

Corning also invested in banks and insurance companies. He purchased the Albany Rolling and Slitting Mill, renamed it the Albany Nail Factory, and used it to corner the market on numerous iron products he sold at his store. The Albany Nail Factory eventually became the Rensselaer Iron Works, which under Corning&#x27;s guidance installed the first Bessemer converter in the United States.

By the time he was 40, Corning had helped found the Albany City Bank, of which he served as president until his death. He had also been appointed to the board of regents for the University of the State of New York, begun speculating on land in western New York, including what are now the town of Corning and city of Corning. A Democrat, Corning also served a term as an Albany alderman beginning in 1828, then served as mayor from 1834 until 1837.

==Railroads==

As an iron dealer, Corning saw the potential of railroads as both a consumer and distributor of his products. When the Utica and Schenectady Railroad was chartered in 1833, Corning was a major investor and served as president and a member of the board of directors. Corning was also a shareholder in and president of the smaller Mohawk and Hudson Railroad. In 1851, the two roads were reorganized as the Mohawk Valley Railroad, of which Corning was president.

Corning remained active in politics, and was a member of the New York State Senate from 1842 to 1845, sitting in the 65th, 66th, 67th and 68th New York State Legislatures. His time in state politics convinced him that the system of local and regional railroads covering upstate New York was inefficient and could be made far more profitable by consolidation. In an effort to create efficiencies that would improve profitability, Corning began planning the New York Central Railroad, what eventually became the largest corporation in America. Corning was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1848 and again in 1852.

In 1853, Corning succeeded in persuading shareholders and executives of six functioning railroads and two that had been planned but were not yet constructed to agree to a plan for consolidating their companies. Corning was the main lobbyist who pursued approval by the New York State Legislature. Though he was a Democrat, Corning appealed for help to Thurlow Weed, the leader of New York&#x27;s Whigs, who controlled the state government. Thanks to the efforts of Corning and Weed, the legislature passed the Consolidation Act on April 2, 1853. As the largest shareholder in the new company, Corning became its first president. He remained in the post for twelve years, during which the New York Central&#x27;s expansion and connections with other railways gave it access to cities from New York City to Chicago, which made it one of the country&#x27;s most important railroads.

Corning amassed a significant fortune, and used it to invest in land as far west as Wisconsin and Iowa. He bought large shares in the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Michigan Central Railroad, and was the largest shareholder in and president of the St. Mary&#x27;s Falls Ship Canal Company. The canal company constructed the canal and locks on the St. Mary&#x27;s River at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, which connected Lake Superior with Lake Huron. The canal company received 750,000 acres (3035 km²) of land in the west; which included 100,000 acres (400 km²) for Corning.

==Civil War==
In 1856 Corning was elected to the 35th Congress, and he served one term, March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1859. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1858, but was elected to a second term in 1860. He served in the 37th Congress from March 4, 1861, until resigning on October 5, 1863.

Corning was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention. In 1861, he was a delegate to the Peace Congress in Washington, D.C. Though he was a Democrat, once the American Civil War began, he supported the Union while also criticizing what he viewed as the excesses of Republican President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s administration. He resigned his seat in Congress before the end of his second term because of failing health and because of his disagreements with Lincoln&#x27;s prosecution of the war. In February 1863, Corning was the Democratic caucus nominee for U.S. Senator from New York, but Republicans controlled the state legislature, and Corning was defeated by Republican Edwin D. Morgan, 86 votes to 70, with one cast for John Adams Dix and one for Daniel S. Dickinson.

In the spring of 1863, Corning organized a public meeting on Lincoln&#x27;s conduct, which passed resolutions in support of the Union but was critical of several Lincoln policies, including military arrests rather than civilian court trials for individuals accused of desertion or avoiding military conscription. Lincoln replied in a lengthy letter that set out his views on what the Constitution allowed a president to do during wartime. In the reply, Lincoln argued for the necessity of arresting anti-government agitators including Clement Vallandigham, famously asking &quot;Must I shoot a simple-minded deserter, while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert?&quot;

Despite disagreeing with Lincoln on how to prosecute the war, Corning fully supported the effort to maintain the Union. When the United States Navy decided to pursue construction of ironclad ships in 1862, John Ericsson contracted with Corning&#x27;s partners John F. Winslow and John Augustus Griswold to manufacture parts and materials for USS &quot;Monitor&quot;.

==Later years==

From the mid-1860s on, Corning reduced the scope of his business dealings, though he remained as president of the Albany City Bank and its successor, and continued as vice chancellor of the University of the State of New York Board of Regents. He died at his home in Albany on April 8, 1872. Corning was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.

==Family==

In 1819, Corning married Harriet Weld (1794-1883). They were the parents of five children:

*Benjamin (1820-1821)
*John (1823-1833)
*Erastus Jr. (1827-1897)
*Joseph (1829-1830)
*Edwin (1836-1871)

After Corning&#x27;s death, his son Erastus Corning Jr. (1827-1897) succeeded to management of Corning&#x27;s business interests. He did not manage them successfully, but after his death his sons Edwin and Parker succeeded in restoring the family&#x27;s wealth. Both were active in politics as Democrats, and helped found a party organization that ran Albany and the surrounding Albany County for decades. Edwin Corning served as lieutenant governor of New York from 1927 to 1928, and Parker Corning served in the United States House of Representatives from 1923 to 1937.

Corning&#x27;s great-grandsons, Edwin Corning&#x27;s sons Erastus 2nd and Edwin Jr., were also active in Albany-area business and politics. Edwin Jr. served in the New York State Assembly from 1955 to 1959, and Erastus 2nd was mayor of Albany for over 40 years, from 1941 to 1983.

<doc id="990391" wikidata="Q135908" url="?curid=990391" title="Zard">
<text>(stylized as ZARD) were a Japanese pop rock group, originally with five members, with lead vocalist Izumi Sakai as its only constant member. Izumi Sakai was also the band&#x27;s core member. Zard&#x27;s work was sold under the record label B-Gram Records, Inc. Their most popular and successful songs are , , and &quot;My Friend&quot; (1996). As of 2023, Zard has sold over 38 million records, making them one of the best-selling music artists in Japan.

==Career==
Zard began when the former CEO of Being Corporation, Daikō Nagato, recruited a 24-year-old model named Sachiko Kamachi. Changing her name to Izumi Sakai in an attempt to cut off her past, she created a group called Zard. Zard made a breakthrough with the release of their debut single February 10, 1991 &quot;Good-bye My Loneliness&quot;, which was a theme song for the Fuji TV drama &quot;Ideals and Reality of Marriage&quot; featuring Misako Tanaka. The song was very successful, reaching No. 9 in the Oricon rankings.

Zard&#x27;s next two singles did not sell as well. The fourth, took a slightly different approach. The group&#x27;s rock style had morphed to popular while the seemingly dark music videos turned to a relatively brighter image. In fact, half of Zard&#x27;s official appearances on TV were related to performing this song, which sold 440,000 copies. At that time, Music Station host Kazuyoshi Morita (aka Tamori) asked Sakai what had taken Zard so long to be on stage. Sakai&#x27;s reply was that they had wanted to make sure Zard would be an economically viable project and hence did not want to go public prematurely.

The major breakthrough for the group came with their sixth single in 1993, &quot;Makenaide&quot;, which became No. 1 in the Oricon charts and went on to sell over 1.8 million copies. Zard went on to release two more songs that reached No. 1, &quot;Yureru Omoi&quot; and &quot;Kitto Wasurenai&quot; in the same year. An album titled &quot;Yureru Omoi&quot; featuring both &quot;Makenaide&quot; and &quot;Yureru Omoi&quot; sold two million copies, the first million milestone for the group in album sales. In fact, Being was so successful in the early 1990s that it was called Being Boom. No one sold more CDs than Zard in this year.

In 1996, Zard had one more million-selling hit, &quot;My Friend&quot;. Although their sales fluctuated among six digits in sales for the remainder of the twentieth century, nine of twenty-one singles reached No. 1 and six reached No. 2. Only two could not break the top four mark. Since they also had three hits selling one million and one other hitting two million copies. On August 31, 1999, Zard held their first concert aboard cruise ship Pacific Venus, where six hundred people were randomly selected out of a million applicants. The DVD for this concert, released on January 26, 2000, had a limited production of 300,000 copies.

Besides being the driving force of Zard (and so much so that it became synonymous with her alone), Izumi Sakai was a very prolific lyricist. She wrote 150 songs during her 17-year career (numerous songs for other artists as well as all of the Zard songs except for two, and from their first album, &quot;Good-bye My Loneliness&quot;, which was written by Daria Kawashima,) and she released several books of poetry as well. An editorial in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; claimed that the secret to Zard&#x27;s success was that while the trend in Japan showed a decrease in the number of music programs on television, Sakai used late night commercials to air her voice and so advertise her works.

She also wrote songs for other artists, most notably for the J-pop groups that shared her management company: Field of View, Wands and Deen, and the late mainland Taiwanese singer Teresa Teng. She also wrote the lyrics for and participated in the collaboration for the single featuring J-pop groups Zard, Zyyg, Rev &amp; Wands. The single also featured famed Japanese baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima. Some of her singles were used in anime, such as &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; and &quot;Detective Conan&quot;. The lyrics of by Field of View, the opening theme song of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, is by Izumi Sakai. Afterward, Zard covered this song in &quot;Today Is Another Day&quot; album.

Zard&#x27;s most successful single, has been used as a theme song for Nippon Television program 24-hour TV, an annual Japanese television program in which a celebrity host is on screen continually for a whole day. Sakai said that she was honored at the song&#x27;s being chosen and looked forward to watching the show. She also said that since &quot;Makenaide&quot; was widely appreciated by the public, she often felt as if that song was not hers to keep.

Sakai was also known for being mysterious. This is partly because her record label did not release much personal information on their artists, but also because she did not make very many personal appearances. She rarely appeared on any live TV music programs (e.g. TV Asahi&#x27;s Music Station), which had been the main public relations tool for the record industry in Japan since 1993, or make any public appearances. Her first concert was in 1999, this being held on a cruise ship for a mere 600 members of her fan club (300 entries x2 among 2 million concert ticket requests). Her first and only concert tour, &quot;What A Beautiful Moment Tour&quot;, was held in 2004, 13 years after her debut. Almost every concert was sold out at the time. The tour ended up having 10 concerts spanning 4 months from March to July 2004, with the final concert held in the famed Nippon Budokan.

Although Zard began as a group, Sakai&#x27;s dominance within it has led to the name &quot;Zard&quot; often being used in Japan to refer to her alone, as a solo female singer. She used to hold a female record in Japan for most single sales until Ayumi Hamasaki released &quot;No Way to Say&quot;. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, as of August 2007, Zard was No. 8 for overall total in Japan. She has had 12 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon Singles Charts, and 9 albums reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon Album Charts. 43 of her singles reached top 10 in the Oricon rankings. Zard has released a total of 45 singles and 17 albums.

Zard was also featured in Tak Matsumoto&#x27;s Ihoujin (August 27, 2003). This single was later included in the cover album &quot;The Hit Parade&quot; produced by Tak Matsumoto.

On a trivial note, Zard&#x27;s album &quot;Oh My Love&quot; released in 1994 reached No. 1 for the 500th edition of the Oricon Rankings since it began in 1970. She has had 12 singles reach the No. 1 spot on the Oricon.

=== Post-Izumi Sakai Zard===
On January 23, 2008, an album based on fan requests was released, titled Zard Request Best: Beautiful Memory. NTV Morning News program, Zoom In Super&#x27;s December 28, 2007 reports that over 500,000 entries were mailed to Being. Surprisingly, Makenaide and Yureru Omoi were not in the top 3, though they did make the top 10. The three songs garnering most votes were 1) Ano Hohoemi o Wasurenaide, 2) Shoujo no Koro ni Modotta Mitai ni, 3) Kakegae no Naimono.

When this album hit number one in the Oricon charts, it marked the eleventh time Zard/Sakai had done so, matching the record held by Dreams Come True for the most number ones by female vocal groups.

== Sakai&#x27;s death ==

Founding member Izumi Sakai died on May 27, 2007, at the age of 40 in Keio University Hospital. She had entered the hospital in June 2006 after discovering she had cervical cancer and had the tumor removed. In April 2007, however, the cancer had spread to her lungs, resulting in her re-admittance to hospital. According to the hospital, she took daily walks every morning. During her walk on May 26, she accidentally fell from the stairs and was discovered at around 5:40 a.m. and taken to the ICU. Never regaining consciousness, she died at 3:10 p.m. the following day. An agency spokesman said:

Sakai had planned to release a new album in the fall, as well as make her first live tour in three years to show her fans that she was fighting strongly against her illnesses.

A memorial service for fans was held on June 27 in a funeral hall in Aoyama, Tokyo. On the previous day, a memorial service for the people concerned was held and Maki Ohguro and Tetsuro Oda and others were in attendance. At the same time, Tak Matsumoto and Koshi Inaba of B&#x27;z, Mai Kuraki and Shigeo Nagashima made announcements in her remembrance.

Two compilation albums were planned for release on August 15, one including a selection of Sakai&#x27;s personal favorite songs, and the other including favorites chosen by her staff. A fan-selected compilation album was also planned for the fall. Two tribute concerts were held—one on September 7 at Osaka Festival Hall, and the other on September 14 at Tokyo Nippon Budokan. These two places were chosen because they were the first and last stops respectively of the &quot;What a beautiful moment Tour&quot; in 2004—the only tour that band had gone on. The new tour was called &quot;What a Beautiful Memory&quot;.

In September 2007, an audience of 13,000 participated in a memorial Budokan concert. Nine screens were set up to show previously unseen footage of Izumi Sakai, and a first single after she died called &quot;Glorious Mind&quot; was played. This was a song that Sakai had recorded before her hospitalization, and was used as the opening theme song of the anime series &quot;Case Closed&quot;. It was not complete at the time of Sakai&#x27;s death, but the chorus footage was complete. Extra minutes where she was singing in English were incorporated from a previously unrelated and unreleased song as well.

<doc id="990393" wikidata="Q210163" url="?curid=990393" title="Astrakhan Khanate">
<text>The Khanate of Astrakhan was a Tatar rump state of the Golden Horde. The khanate existed in the 15th and 16th centuries in the area adjacent to the mouth of the Volga river, around the modern city of Astrakhan. Its khans claimed patrilineal descent from Toqa Temür, the thirteenth son of Jochi and grandson of Genghis Khan.

Mahmud bin Küchük established the Khanate in the 1460s. The capital was the city of Xacitarxan, also known as Astrakhan in Russian chronicles. Its territory included the Lower Volga valley and the Volga Delta, including most of what is now Astrakhan Oblast and the steppeland on the right bank of Volga in present-day Kalmykia. To the south was the Caspian Sea, to the east the Nogai Horde, and to the west Nogais who were theoretically subjects of the Crimean Khanate.

==Before the Khanate==
The area was a natural center since it was the intersection of the north–south trade route down the Volga to Persia and the east–west trade route north of the Caspian. From the sixth century it was populated by various Turkic-speaking tribes. They formed two states: Old Great Bulgaria () and the Khazars (c. 650–969). Following the Mongol conquest the western steppe broke off and became the Golden Horde (c. 1240–1502). In the fifteenth century parts of the Horde broke off as follows: 1438: Khanate of Kazan, 1441: Khanate of Crimea, 1466: Astrakhan, 1480: Russia. The steppe remnant ended in 1502 and steppe peoples around Astrakhan became the Nogai Horde.

==Demography and society==
Most of the population of the Astrakhan khanate were Astrakhan Tatars and Nogais. Merchants carried on a transit trade between Muscovy, Kazan, Crimea, Central Asia, and the Transcaucasus region.

The nobility consisted of feudal ranks, which were, from highest to lowest: the khan, sultans, begs, and morzalar. The rest of the population were known as &quot;qara xalıq&quot;, (&#x27;black people&#x27;, or more accurately in Old Turkic, &quot;great creation&quot; implying &#x27;the creatures at large&quot; or common folks, when &quot;qara&quot; stood for &quot;big&quot; and &quot;great&quot; not just black, and &quot;aq&quot; (white), stood also for delicate, small, dainty etc.), the standard Turkic designation for commoners.

The state religion was Sunni Islam. With its conquest by the Russians in 1556, Sunni Islam was largely replaced by Russian Orthodox Christianity, though the region to this day is home to a Sunni Muslim minority. The Kalmyks are largely Buddhist.

==History==

The Astrakhan khanate is poorly documented. According to Frank &quot;The dates and activities of these rulers are faintly represented in the sources, when they are represented at all.&quot; About all we have is an imperfect khan list with uncertain regnal dates and a few military and diplomatic events and traveler&#x27;s reports. The capital was Xacitarxan, which the Russians called Astrakhan, 12 km north of modern Astrakhan. After the conquest, the town and name were moved to the present location.

The khanate is said to have been founded in 1466, but did not become fully separate from the Golden Horde until the Horde&#x27;s end in 1502. In 1459 the Golden Horde ruler Küchük Muhammad died and power was split between his sons Ahmed Khan bin Küchük, the man who lost Russia in 1480, and Mahmud bin Küchük who was based around Astrakhan. The khanate was founded either by Mahmud or his son Qasim I. The khans of Astrakhan were all descended from Mahmud or his brother Ahmed. It was visited by Ambrogio Contarini in 1476. Howorth (only) says it was besieged by Ahmed and Ibak Khan some time before 1480. The Russian Wikipedia (only) says it was besieged by Ibak&#x27;s brother and the Nogais in 1492. It was twice briefly occupied by Crimea (Mehmed I Giray in 1523 and Sahib I Giray in 1549). The khanate traditionally had military and diplomatic relations with Crimea, the Nogais and sometimes the Circassians. Diplomatic contact with Moscow began in 1532 or earlier. About this time Moscow was expanding east toward Kazan which it conquered in 1552. It also was gaining the power to exert force down the Volga between Kazan and Astrakhan, something that is not explained in the sources. In 1551, Yamghurchi of Astrakhan made a nominal submission to Moscow. He soon changed sides and allied with Crimea and the Nogais. Russia sent 30,000 troops against him. In 1554 he fled the town and Russia imposed its client Dervish Ali Astrakhani who soon began intriguing with the Crimeans. Russia sent more troops and occupied Astrakhan in 1556, proceeding to destroy the largest slave market on the Volga. In 1558, Astrakhan was moved 12 km south to its present location. In 1569, the Ottomans were unable to capture Astrakhan.

<text>Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) (formerly Zee Telefilms) is an Indian media conglomerate. Headquartered in Mumbai, it has interests in television, print, internet, film, and businesses related to mobile content, and operates 45 channels worldwide.

== History ==
=== Independent era ===
In April 1995, the company launched the premium movie channel Zee Cinema, the first channel of its sort in the country. Until 1999, programming was done by Star TV. In the following years Zee Cinema has also catered to international markets like South-East America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, Indonesia and Asia Pacific and the Rest of Africa. Zee Cinema (Canada) is available in Canada as a joint ventures with Ethnic Group.

Zee Telefilms launched a Nickelodeon-branded programming block in 1999 as part of a distribution deal between Viacom International and Zee Telefilms. It was replaced by a new Cartoon Network block in 2002.

In 2008, Zee Networks launched Zee Motion Pictures and Zee Limelight (now Zee Studios) for the development, production, distribution and marketing of mainstream films in Indian languages, including Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali and Marathi.

In 2015, Zee acquired Sarthak TV, an Odia-language pay television channel.

In 2017, the company acquired the majority stake of the Reliance Broadcast Network. It also planned to acquire 9X Media in October 2017 for the cost of 160 crore, however, the plan fell through in March 2018.
A partially-owned subsidiary, Diligent Media Corporation, is a publisher of Indian daily newspapers and websites. DMC is a joint venture between Zee and the Dainik Bhaskar Group.

In 2018, Zee launched Zee Theatre, which offers a collection of recorded theatre plays also called teleplay- produced in India and internationally.

=== Sale talks ===
In February 2019, media reported that Essel Group was in talks to sell their shares from the Zee Entertainment Enterprises to save them from debt.
Top Sony officials including Mike Hopkins, chairman of Sony Pictures Television, and Tony Vinciquerra, chairman of Sony Pictures, had visited Subhash Chandra and his family at his residence shortly after Chandra announced his intent to sell half of the promoter holding in Zee Entertainment Enterprises to a global strategic investor.On 2 April reports said that some other promoters were willing to sell their shares worth 332 crore. On 3 April media reported Sony and Zee Entertainment Enterprises deal off. 
On 1 August media reports Invesco Oppenheimer Fund to buy 11% stake in Zee Entertainment.

In September 2021, it was reported that Invesco Developing Markets Funds and OFI Global China Fund LLC, who jointly holds a 17.88% stake, wanted Punit Goenka (also the son of founder) to step down as MD and CEO. It was also reported that Essel Group owns a sum of 3.99% minority stake.

In 2024, Zee Entertainment Enterprises partnered with Sony Pictures Entertainment.

==== Attempted merger with Sony Pictures Networks India ====
On 22 September 2021, the company announced its intent to merge with Sony Pictures Networks India. Sony Pictures will hold a majority stake in the proposed merged entity, which will be headed by Zee&#x27;s Punit Goenka. In December 2021, the merger was approved by the two companies boards. Sony will hold a stake close to 51% in the company, with Zee controlling the remaining stake.

On 10 August 2023, the National Company Law Tribunal approved the proposed Sony/Zee merger.

On 18 January 2024, the anticipated $10 billion merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Sony Pictures India progressed as ZEE&#x27;s stock increased amid reports that CEO Punit Goenka might step down, potentially resolving a major deadlock in the merger process. However, on 22 January 2024, Sony Pictures Networks India issued a notice to Zee Entertainment Enterprises effectively terminating the merger proceedings due to, among other reasons, the closing conditions to the merger not being satisfied by the given deadline of 21 January.

== Controversy ==
=== Dispute between promoters ===
On 11 September 2021, Invesco asked Zee management to call shareholders an &quot;extraordinary general meeting&quot; (EGM) to consider its demands. One of the main demands was the removal of Punit Goenka, son of the Zee Network founder. However Zee board rejects a demand from Invesco to convene an extraordinary general meeting. Invesco Developing Market Funds Moves to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Bombay High Court seeking a mandatory order for Zee Enterprises Entertainment Limited (ZEEL) to call the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that the shareholder has been demanding.

Zee Board replied to Invesco&#x27;s open letter saying they didn&#x27;t care about the company, and Invesco was not motivated by concerns related to any corporate governance issue but &quot;by the events that transpired during February–April 2021 pointing Invesco purposed deal with Reliance Industries.

On 21 October, Bombay High Court asked the Zee board to call EGM as demanded by shareholder Invesco, and Counsel appearing for Zee Entertainment said the company will inform the date of the EGM by the morning of 22 October.

On 22 October, Zee replied to the court that the board can&#x27;t give a nod to something that will turn out to be illegal, so HC postponed hearing of the Zee-Invesco matter to 26 October. Also, on 26 October Bombay High Court had restrained Invesco from taking any action in furtherance of their requisition notice (to call an EGM).

On 7 December, Invesco headed towards a resolution expected to back the merger deal with Sony as long as the Goenka family does not get any preferential equity.

On 22 December, Board of Zee signed definitive agreements with Sony after received approval from its board of directors

=== Zee Music vs Sonu Nigam ===
Sonu Nigam alleged that he was banned by the Zee Music Company after he tweeted in support of politician Kumar Vishwas.

<doc id="990395" wikidata="Q7661167" url="?curid=990395" title="Symbolic Stream Generator">
<text>The Symbolic Stream Generator (or SSG) is a software productivity aid by Unisys for their mainframe computers of the former UNIVAC 1100/2200 series.

SSG is used to generate RUN-Streams (corresponding to IBM&#x27;s Job Control Language), apply and administer symbolic changes to program sources as a form of version control, and for many other purposes.

An SSG program (i.e., its &quot;job control script&quot;) is called a &quot;Skeleton&quot;, and its programming language Symstream.

The tool created output streams based on interpreting data provided via multiple input sources. It was originally created by Univac for the creation of Operating System (OS) updates. It was later adopted by the general user community for the creation of complex batch and real-time computer processes. The sources could recursively reference additional sources, providing wide flexibility in input parsing. The rules for output creation were also in source files, with similar levels of dynamic input capability. Interpretation of the multiple input sources allowed for dynamic creation of output stream content. Complex recursive processes could be applied to create program source code, job execution sequences, simulated dynamic input from virtual consoles, and in general provide scripting capabilities reminiscent of the Unix grep and yacc tools.

<doc id="990397" wikidata="Q1911055" url="?curid=990397" title="Maui Nui">
<text>Maui Nui is a modern geologists&#x27; name given to a prehistoric Hawaiian island and the corresponding modern biogeographic region. Maui Nui is composed of four modern islands: Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Kahoʻolawe. Administratively, the four modern islands comprise Maui County (and a tiny part of Molokaʻi called Kalawao County). Long after the breakup of Maui Nui, the four modern islands retained plant and animal life similar to each other. Thus, Maui Nui is not only a prehistoric island but also a modern biogeographic region.

== Geology ==
Maui Nui formed and broke up during the Pleistocene Epoch, which lasted from about 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago.

Maui Nui is built from seven shield volcanoes. The three oldest are Penguin Bank, West Molokaʻi, and East Molokaʻi, which probably range from slightly over to slightly less than 2 million years old. The four younger volcanoes are Lāna‘i, West Maui, Kaho‘olawe, and Haleakalā, which probably formed between 1.5 and 2 million years ago.

At its prime 1.2 million years ago, Maui Nui was , 50% larger than today&#x27;s Hawaiʻi Island. The island of Maui Nui included four modern islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and Kahoʻolawe) and landmass west of Molokaʻi called Penguin Bank, which is now completely submerged.
Maui Nui broke up as rising sea levels flooded the connections between the volcanoes. The breakup was complex because global sea levels rose and fell intermittently during the Quaternary glaciation. About 600,000 years ago, the connection between Molokaʻi and the island of Lāna‘i/Maui/Kahoʻolawe became intermittent. About 400,000 years ago, the connection between Lāna‘i and Maui/Kahoʻolawe also became intermittent. The connection between Maui and Kahoʻolawe was permanently broken between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago. Maui, Lāna‘i, and Molokaʻi were connected intermittently thereafter, most recently about 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Today, the sea floor between these four islands is relatively shallow, about deep. At the outer edges of former Maui Nui, as with the edges of all Hawaiian Islands, the sea floor plummets to the abyssal plain of the Pacific Ocean.

== Biogeography ==

The term Maui Nui is also used as a modern biogeographic region of Hawaii. Long after the breakup of Maui Nui, the four modern islands retained similar plant and animal life. Many plant and animal species occur across multiple islands of former Maui Nui but are found nowhere else in Hawaii.

Many of Hawaii&#x27;s native species declined or became extinct after Polynesian arrival or in the modern era, making the study of Hawaiian biogeography more complicated. Among Hawaii&#x27;s native birds, the ʻākohekohe (&quot;Palmeria dolei&quot;) only survives on Maui, but it also occurred on Molokaʻi until 1907. The black mamo (&quot;Drepanis funerea&quot;) was historically documented only on Molokaʻi until its extinction in 1907, but fossils are also known from Maui. The Maui Nui icterid-like gaper (&quot;Aidemedia lutetiae&quot;) was never documented historically, but fossils are known from Maui and Molokaʻi. Among Hawaii&#x27;s native plants, the maui hala pepe (&quot;Dracaena rockii&quot;) is known from Maui and Molokaʻi, and survives on both islands. Pua ʻala (&quot;Brighamia rockii&quot;) survives only on Molokaʻi, but was historically documented on Maui and Lāna‘i. Additional examples of plants and animals endemic to the Maui Nui region appear in List of Hawaiian animals extinct in the Holocene and Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands. 

Conversely, the ʻelepaio (genus &quot;Chasiempis&quot;) have a disjunct distribution. These birds occur on Hawaiʻi Island, Oʻahu, and Kauaʻi, but are curiously absent from the islands of former Maui Nui (both currently and in the fossil record).

Some bird species use the term &quot;Maui Nui&quot; in their common names, such as the Maui Nui large-billed moa-nalo (&quot;Thambetochen chauliodous&quot;), Maui Nui icterid-like gaper (&quot;Aidemedia lutetiae&quot;), Maui Nui ʻakialoa (&quot;Akialoa lanaiensis&quot;), Maui Nui ʻalauahio (&quot;Paroreomyza montana&quot;), and Maui Nui finch (&quot;Telespiza ypsilon&quot;). All of these species survived for thousands of years after the breakup of Maui Nui, and the Maui population of the Maui Nui ʻalauahio survives to the present. Thus, Maui Nui is not just a prehistoric island but also a modern biogeographic region.

<doc id="990400" wikidata="Q606526" url="?curid=990400" title="The Skye Boat Song">
<text>&quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot; (Roud 3772) is a late 19th-century Scottish song adaptation of a Gaelic song composed c.1782 by William Ross, entitled &quot;Cuachag nan Craobh&quot; (&quot;Cuckoo of the Tree&quot;). In the original song, the composer laments to a cuckoo that his unrequited love, Lady Marion Ross, is rejecting him. The 19th century English lyrics instead evoked the journey of Prince Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;) from Benbecula to the Isle of Skye as he evaded capture by government soldiers after his defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

Sir Harold Boulton, 2nd Baronet composed the new lyrics to Ross&#x27;s song which had been heard by Anne Campbell MacLeod in the 1870s, and the line &quot;Over the Sea to Skye&quot; is now a cornerstone of the tourism industry on the Isle of Skye.

Alternative lyrics to the tune were written by Robert Louis Stevenson, probably in 1885. After hearing the Jacobite airs sung by a visitor, he judged the lyrics to be &quot;unworthy&quot;, so made a new set of verses &quot;more in harmony with the plaintive tune&quot;.

It is often played as a slow lullaby or waltz, and entered into the modern folk canon in the twentieth century with versions by Paul Robeson, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart, Roger Whittaker, Tori Amos, and many others.

==Content==
The text of the song gives an account of how Bonnie Prince Charlie, disguised as a serving maid, escaped in a small boat after the defeat of his Jacobite rising of 1745, with the aid of Flora MacDonald. The song draws on the motifs of Jacobitism although it was composed nearly a century and a half after the episode it describes. Especially Stevenson&#x27;s version, which gives the boat&#x27;s course (Mull was astern, Rum on the port, Eigg on the starboard bow) seems to describe Charles&#x27;s flight from the mainland, but that is unhistorical. The only time Charles was in Skye was when he left Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides to avoid the increasingly thorough government searches. It is unlikely that a boat from Benbecula would sail south of Rum to travel to Skye.

==Origin==
The lyrics were written by Sir Harold Boulton, 2nd Baronet, to Ross&#x27;s song collected in the 1870s by Anne Campbell MacLeod (1855–1921), who became Lady Wilson by marriage to Sir James Wilson, KSCI (1853–1926), in 1888. The song was first published by Boulton and MacLeod, London, in 1884, in &quot;Songs of the North&quot;, a book that went into at least twenty editions. In later editions, MacLeod&#x27;s name was dropped and the ascription &quot;Old Highland rowing measure arranged by Malcolm Lawson&quot; was substituted. It was quickly taken up by other compilers, such as Laura Alexandrine Smith&#x27;s &quot;Music of the Waters&quot; (published 1888). Lawson was the elder brother of artist Cecil Gordon Lawson.

The song is set in the style of a &quot;iorram&quot;, a Gaelic rowing song. According to Andrew Kuntz, a collector of folk music lore, MacLeod was on a trip to the isle of Skye and was being rowed over Loch Coruisk (, the &quot;Cauldron of Waters&quot;) when the rowers broke into a Gaelic rowing song &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Cuckoo in the Grove&quot;). MacLeod set down what she remembered of the air, with the intention of using it in a book she was to co-author with Boulton, who later added the section with the Jacobite associations. &quot;As a piece of modern romantic literature with traditional links it succeeded perhaps too well, for soon people began &#x27;remembering&#x27; they had learned the song in their childhood, and that the words were &#x27;old Gaelic lines&#x27;,&quot; Andrew Kuntz has observed.

The song was not in any older books of Scottish songs, though it is in most collections like &quot;The Fireside Book of Folk Songs&quot;. It is often sung as a lullaby, in a slow rocking 6/8 time.

==Recording history and covers==
It was extremely popular in its day and, from its first recording by Tom Bryce on 29 April 1899, it became a standard among Scottish folk and dance musicians. From the 1960s onwards, it became even more widely known and has remained popular in mainstream music genres.

The song was also used in the British World War II film, &quot;Above Us The Waves&quot; (1955), with John Mills, James Robertson Justice and John Gregson. The film was based on the attack by British midget submarines (human torpedoes) on the German battleship Tirpitz in a Norwegian fjord during the war.

Michael Tippett originally included the song, titled as &quot;Over the Sea to Skye&quot;, in his arrangements of &quot;Four Songs from the British Isles&quot; for unaccompanied four-part chorus in 1957, commissioned by North West German Radio, Bremen, for a festival of European folk song. The amateur choir for which they were intended found the songs too difficult, and the first performance took place in July 1958, given by the London Bach Group, conducted by John Minchinton, at Royaumont in France. Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Selected Letters&quot; states that he proposed to replace &quot;Over the Sea to Skye&quot; because it was &quot;too strictly held by a publisher here&quot;.

Alfred Deller recorded a version for his album &quot;Western Wind&quot; in 1958, together with Desmond Dupré on guitar and John Sothcott on recorder. It was performed to great acclaim and recorded by artist and social activist Paul Robeson in 1959 and 1960.

Welshman Tom Jones recorded a version, arranged by Lee Lawson and Harold Boulton, on his 1965 debut album &quot;Along Came Jones&quot;. The same album, released in the U.S. as &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot;, which included only 12 of the original 16 tracks, gave no attribution for the arrangement but did characterise the song as &quot;Trad.—2:57.&quot; Esther &amp; Abi Ofarim recorded the song under the title &quot;Bonnie Boat&quot; for their album &quot;Das Neue Esther &amp; Abi Ofarim Album&quot; (1966).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Patrick Troughton, as the Second Doctor on the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, played the song repeatedly on his recorder in episode 6, scene 10 of &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (broadcast 9 March 1968).
Ncuti Gatwa, as the Fifteenth Doctor, sings the songs to calm himself while standing on a land mine, in episode 3 of series 14, &quot;Boom&quot; (broadcast 18 May 2024).

===Hits Down Under===
Among later renditions that became well known were Peter Nelson and The Castaways from New Zealand, who released a version in 1966, as did Western Australian artist Glen Ingram. Both versions were in the Australian hit parade in 1966. A tough garage rock version of the song by a New Guinean band, The Stalemates, was included on the Viking Records compilation &quot;The New Guinea Scene&quot; in 1969.

===1970s===
Calum Kennedy included a version on &quot;Songs of Scotland and Ireland&quot; (Beltona 1971), and Rod Stewart recorded two versions of the song with The Atlantic Crossing Drum &amp; Pipe Band during the sessions for &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot; between 1974 and 1975. They were given an official release on the deluxe re-release of the album in 2009.

===After 1980===
&quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot; can be heard at the beginning of &quot;Who Stole the Bagpipes&quot;, the second episode in season one of the early 1980s British cartoon &quot;Dangermouse&quot;. It can also be heard in &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; by the New Zealand musical theatre duo The Front Lawn on their 1989 album Songs from the Front Lawn.

Roger Whittaker&#x27;s duet version with Des O&#x27;Connor, released in 1986, made the UK top 10; it combined O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s vocals with Whittaker&#x27;s whistling version, a part of his repertoire since at least the mid-1970s. The track was recorded at London&#x27;s Holland Park Lansdowne Studios (now a high-end residential underground property) with session drummer Peter Boita along with all the high-profile studio session players of the day. The cellist Julian Lloyd Webber recorded an instrumental version of the song in 1986 on the album &quot;Encore!&quot;.

In the 1987 horror movie, &quot;It&#x27;s Alive III: Island of the Alive&quot;, the main character played by Michael Moriarty sings the song on board a boat with crew members at 46 mins 17 secs.

The Shadows played an instrumental version of the song on their 1987 album &quot;Simply Shadows&quot;. Singer Tori Amos covered the song as part of a song trilogy entitled &quot;Etienne Trilogy&quot; on her debut album &quot;Y Kant Tori Read&quot; (1988). James Galway and The Chieftains recorded an instrumental version (which was used as background music for a Johnnie Walker commercial) in February 1990 at Studios 301, Sydney, Australia, released on the album &quot;Over the Sea to Skye – The Celtic Connection&quot;. There is also a version on The Corries &quot;In Concert / Scottish Love Songs&quot; album (track 19). Galway plays the instrumental version on episode 1957 of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, originally aired in 1984.

Stellan Skarsgård&#x27;s character plays this song on the cello in the 1992 film &quot;Wind&quot;. Canadian Punk band The Real McKenzies covered this song on their 1995 debut album &quot;The Real McKenzies&quot;.

===21st century===
The music can be heard in Season 3, episode 12 of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; before the first wedding of Charlotte York to Trey McDougal.

Scottish singer Barbara Dickson recorded the song in 2006, and Marc Gunn included it on his 2013 album &quot;Scottish Songs of Drinking &amp; Rebellion&quot;.

Bear McCreary adapted the song as the opening titles of the 2014 TV series &quot;Outlander&quot;, sung by Raya Yarbrough, changing the text of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s poem &quot;Sing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone&quot; (1892) to &quot;&quot; to fit the story. In season 7, the opening is sung by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

It can also be heard as background instrumental music in several episodes of the American serial killer television series &quot;Dexter&quot;. Peter Hollens recorded an a capella cover of the song for the 2018 album &quot;Legendary Folk songs&quot;.

It&#x27;s sung by the character Claire Louise McLeod (played by Lisa Chappell) on season 1, episode 5, &quot;Taking the Reins&quot; of the Australian TV series &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot;.

George Donaldson of Celtic Thunder sang it in the 2015 show &quot;Heritage&quot; (arr. Phil Coulter) and on the CD and DVD of the same name. Celtic Thunder Limited. USA Sony Music Entertainment.

The Choral Scholars of University College Dublin recorded an arrangement by their artistic director Desmond Earley for their 2015 album &quot;Invisible Stars: Choral Works of Ireland and Scotland&quot;

The song was played by pipers as the coffin of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II travelled up the Long Walk to Windsor Castle on 19 September 2022. Media comment included speculation that this was to &#x27;put to rest&#x27; the conflict between the Jacobite and Hannoverian houses.

The song reappears in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the episode &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; in October 2022, played by the Master on the recorder, which in-universe is supposed to be the same recorder that the Second Doctor used.

The song reappears again in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the episode &quot;Boom&quot; in May 2024, sung by the Fifteenth Doctor.

===Original lyrics===

&lt;poem&gt;[Chorus:]
Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
Onward! the sailors cry;
Carry the lad that&#x27;s born to be king
Over the sea to Skye.

1. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
Thunderclaps rend the air;
Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,
Follow they will not dare.

[Chorus]

2. Many&#x27;s the lad, fought on that day
Well the claymore did wield;
When the night came, silently lay
Dead on Culloden&#x27;s field.

[Chorus]

3. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
Ocean&#x27;s a royal bed.
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head.

[Chorus]

4. Burned are their homes, exile and death
Scatter the loyal men;
Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath
Charlie will come again.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Stevenson&#x27;s poem===
Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1892 poem, which has been sung to the tune, has the following text:

&lt;poem&gt;[Chorus:]
 Sing me a song of a lad that is gone,
Say, could that lad be I?
Merry of soul he sailed on a day
Over the sea to Skye.

1. Mull was astern, Rum on the port,
Eigg on the starboard bow;
Glory of youth glowed in his soul;
Where is that glory now?

[Chorus]

2. Give me again all that was there,
Give me the sun that shone!
Give me the eyes, give me the soul,
Give me the lad that&#x27;s gone!

[Chorus]

3. Billow and breeze, islands and seas,
Mountains of rain and sun,
All that was good, all that was fair,
All that was me is gone.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Other versions===
There has also been a hymn adaptation of the tune, known as &quot;Spirit of God Unseen as the Wind&quot;; some of the lyrics vary.

&quot;The Skye Boat Song&quot; has been parodied in song by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders on their comedy series &quot;French and Saunders&quot;.

<text>The National Intelligence Council (NIC), established in 1979 and reporting to the Director of National Intelligence, bridges the United States Intelligence Community (IC) with policy makers in the United States. The NIC produces the &quot;Global Trends&quot; report every four years beginning in 1997, for the incoming President of the United States. Their work is based on intelligence from a wide variety of sources that includes experts in academia and the private sector. NIC documents and reports which are used by policymakers, include the National Intelligence Estimate and the Global Trends reports delivered every four years. The NIC&#x27;s goal is to provide policymakers with the best available information, that is unvarnished, unbiased and without regard to whether the analytic judgments conform to current U.S. policy.

One of the NIC&#x27;s most important analytical projects is a Global Trends report produced for the incoming US president, which is usually delivered to the incoming president between Election Day and Inauguration Day. The Global Trends reports assess critical drivers and scenarios for global trends with an approximate time horizon of fifteen years. The Global Trends analysis provides a basis for long-range strategic policy assessment for the White House and the Intelligence Community. In 1997, the Office of the NIC Director released the first Global Trends report, &quot;Global Trends 2010&quot;, and in March 2021, their most recent report, &quot;NIC Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World&quot;.

== Overview ==
When Walter Bedell Smith became Director of Central Intelligence in 1950, he established Office of National Estimates (ONE), whose sole purpose was to produce National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs). There were two components in ONE, a staff which drafted the estimates and a senior body, the Board of National Estimates, which reviewed the estimates, coordinated the judgments with other agencies, and negotiated over their final form. The ONE consisted of a group of intelligence professionals, complemented by retired military officers, diplomats, and academics. Though ONE, which reported to the DCI, was officially outside of the CIA, many ONE members came from the agency.

The National Intelligence Council (NIC), which was established in 1979, also reports to the Director of National Intelligence. The NIC bridges the United States Intelligence Community (IC) with policy makers in the United States, according to a February 2, 2007 DNI report.

The report combines &quot;traditional national security challenges&quot; with &quot;social trends that have clear security implications&quot;.

In 2011, NIC members included &quot;18 senior analysts and national security policy experts&quot;, who were appointed by the Director of National Intelligence. The NIC support the work of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council. Congress may at times request that the NIC prepare &quot;specific estimates and other analytical products&quot; to inform &quot;consideration of legislation&quot;, according to a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report. The NIC also &quot;provides the U.S. intelligence community&#x27;s best judgments on crucial international issues&quot;.

The NIC has a Chairman and Vice Chairman, as well as a Vice Chairman for Evaluation, a Director of Strategic Plans and Outreach, a Director of Analysis and Production Staff, a Special Adviser, and National Intelligence Officers (NIOs) and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for different subject matters including Africa, East Asia, Europe, Latin America, Near East, South Asia, Russia and Eurasia. Issues include economics and global issues, science and technology, intelligence assurance, military issues, transnational threats, warning, weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation, and cyber.

The first director of the NIC was Richard Lehman, (1979–1981) who served during the tenure of then President Jimmy Carter.

==Global Trends reports==
One of the NIC&#x27;s most important analytical projects is a Global Trends report produced for the incoming US president which is usually delivered to the incoming president between Election Day and Inauguration Day. The Global Trends reports assess critical drivers and scenarios for global trends with an approximate time horizon of fifteen years. While the Global Trends analysis provides a basis for long-range strategic policy assessment for the White House and the intelligence community, it is proscribed by law to not provide any policy recommendations. 

The goal of the report is to examine &quot;longer-term impacts&quot; of &quot;current changes&quot; on the &quot;world of the future&quot;—twenty years ahead. 

The first Global Trends report was released in 1997, and the most recent, &quot;NIC Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World&#x27;&quot; was released in March 2021. The NIC&#x27;s Strategic Futures Group, under the direction of Maria Langan-Riekhof, led the publication of the &quot;Global Trends 2040&quot; report, working with 18 organizations that make up the United States Intelligence Community. This includes the National Security Agency and C.I.A.

Previous reports include &quot;Global Trends 2035: Paradox of Progress&quot; in January 2017, &quot;Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds&quot; in 2012, &quot;Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World&quot;, &quot;Global Trends 2020: Mapping the Global Future&quot;, &quot;Global Trends 2010&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Global Trends 2015: A Dialogue About the Future With Nongovernment Experts&quot; in December 2000.

=== Global Trends 2020: Mapping the Global Future ===
In December 2004, the NIC published a report on its 2020 Project, titled &quot;Global Trends 2020: Mapping the Global Future&quot;. Developed in consultation with &quot;non-governmental experts around the world,&quot; the report examined possible scenarios evolving out of global trends shaping international politics and economics. Particular emphasis was put on the increasing role of China and India on the global stage, as well as the evolution of radical Islamic terrorism worldwide. Considerations are made for the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the use of biological and chemical weapons in future terrorist attacks.

===Global Trends 2035: Paradox of Progress===
At the beginning the Presidency of Donald Trump in January 2017, the Obama administration released its report titled, &quot;Global Trends 2035: Paradox of Progress&quot;, which &quot;highlighted the risk of a pandemic and the vast economic disruption it could cause.&quot;

===Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World===
In their April 15, 2021 article about the March 2021 report, &quot;NIC Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board cited experts in Washington saying &quot;they do not recall a gloomier&quot; NIC Global Trends report. The &quot;Times&quot; listed headings such as &quot;Competitive Coexistence&quot;, &quot;Separate Silos&quot;, &quot;Tragedy and Mobilization&quot;, and &quot;A World Adrift&quot; and questions if we will heed the report&#x27;s warnings &quot;at a time when states and societies are turning inward and political discourse has become poisonous.&quot; According to the report, &quot;Nationalism and polarization have been on the rise in many countries, especially exclusionary nationalism. Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups.&quot;

<text>Juan José Viamonte González (February 9, 1774 – March 31, 1843) was an Argentine general in the early 19th century.

==Life and Politics==
Viamonte was born in Buenos Aires and entered the army in his youth following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He fought in the First British Invasion with the rank of lieutenant, and after his participation in the Second Invasion, having distinguished himself in the defense of the Colegio de San Carlos, was promoted to captain.

He took part on the Buenos Aires Cabildo of May 22, 1810 and after the revolution he fought at the battles of Suipacha and Huaqui. After this latter battle he was accused of not joining with the 1,500 men under his command, while he was doing military exercises nearby. This accusation led to a long court-martial which finally acquitted him and he remained in the army.

In November 1814, when the civil war between Federales and Unitarians had started, he was named governor of Entre Ríos Province.

The following year he took part in the revolution against Supreme Director Carlos María de Alvear, and later he was sent to Santa Fe Province to control the advance of the federalists. The day after his arrival governor Francisco Candioti died, which gave Viamonte the opportunity to make the province depend again on Buenos Aires. The following year he was expelled in a rising organized by local caudillos Mariano Vera and Estanislao López, and he was sent to be imprisoned at Artigas encampment.

In May 1818 he was a deputy to the Congress of Tucumán, and the following year he was named chief of the expeditionary army of Santa Fe, replacing Juan Ramón Balcarce. Estanislao López immobilized the army directed from Córdoba by Juan Bautista Bustos and captured Viamonte at Rosario, forcing him to sign the armistice of Santo Tomé.

He was exiled to Montevideo after the Battle of Cepeda (1820), but he returned a year later in 1821 and was named governor of Buenos Aires Province due to the absence of Martín Rodríguez.

He was a deputy to the General Congress of 1824 and he supported the unitarian constitution of 1826, but later on he changed sides and joined Dorrego&#x27;s Federal Party. After the failed unitarian experiment of Juan Lavalle, he was interim governor in 1829, a post in which he did practically nothing but ensure the ascent to power of Juan Manuel de Rosas.

In 1833, when governor Balcarce was deposed in the Revolution of the Restorers, he returned to the governorship but Rosas forced him to resign in June 1834, a resignation that was not readily accepted as nobody wanted to take the post. Finally in October the legislature reached a compromise and its president Manuel Vicente Maza, was forced to take the governorship.

Viamonte was exiled in Montevideo in 1839 for the last time where he died in 1843. His remains were transported back to Buenos Aires, and were interred in the La Recoleta Cemetery.

<doc id="990419" wikidata="Q3486963" url="?curid=990419" title="Loveland frog">
<text>In Ohio folklore, the Loveland frog (also known as the Loveland frogman or Loveland lizard) is a legendary humanoid frog described as standing roughly tall, allegedly spotted in Loveland, Ohio. In 1972, the Loveland frog legend gained renewed attention when a Loveland police officer reported to a colleague that he had seen an animal consistent with descriptions of the frogman. After a reported sighting in 2016, the second officer called a news station to report that he had shot and killed the same creature some weeks after the 1972 incident and had identified it as a large iguana that was missing its tail.

University of Cincinnati folklore professor Edgar Slotkin compared the Loveland frog to Paul Bunyan, saying that stories about it have been passed down for &quot;several decades&quot; and that sighting reports seem to come in predictable cycles.

==Legends==
According to various legends, the creature was first sighted by a businessman or a traveling salesman driving along an unnamed road late at night in 1955, with some versions of the story specifying the month of May. In one story, the driver was heading out of the Branch Hill neighborhood when he spotted three figures stood erect on their hind legs along the side of the road, each in height, with leathery skin and frog faces. In other versions of the story, the creatures were spotted under or over a poorly lit bridge, and one held a wand over its head that fired a spray of sparks.

==Loveland police reports==
On March 3, 1972, at 1:00am, Loveland police officer Ray Shockey was driving on Riverside Drive near the Totes boot factory and the Little Miami River when an unidentified animal scurried across the road in front of his vehicle. The animal was fully illuminated in his vehicle&#x27;s headlights, and he described it as long and about , with leathery skin. He reported spotting the animal &quot;crouched like a frog&quot; before it momentarily stood erect to climb over the guardrail and back down towards the river.

Two weeks after the incident, a second Loveland police officer, Mark Matthews, reported seeing an unidentified animal crouched along the road in the same vicinity as Shockey&#x27;s sighting. Matthews shot the animal, recovered the body, and put it in his trunk to show officer Shockey. According to Matthews, it was &quot;a large iguana about long&quot;, and he didn&#x27;t immediately recognize it because it was missing its tail. Matthews speculated the iguana had been someone&#x27;s pet that &quot;either got loose or was released when it grew too large&quot;. According to Matthews, Shockey was shown the dead iguana and confirmed it was the animal he had seen two weeks previously. Matthews recounted the incident to an author of a book about urban legends, but says the author &quot;omitted the part that confirmed that the creature was an iguana rather than a Frogman&quot;. Mathews also recounted the frogman story in 2016 again on WCPO-TV.

==In fiction==
James Renner&#x27;s science fiction/mystery novel &quot;The Man From Primrose Lane&quot; features a version of the Loveland frog.

In May 2014, the Loveland frog legend was made into a musical, titled &quot;Hot Damn! It&#x27;s the Loveland Frog!&quot;. The musical premiered at the Art Academy of Cincinnati during the 2014 Cincinnati Fringe Festival.

In 2024, a horror found footage film directed by Anthony Cousins, &quot;Frogman&quot;, was released.

==Commemorations==
In 2023, the Loveland frog became the city&#x27;s mascot. The frog, dressed as a &quot;frog prince&quot;, debuted at the city&#x27;s second annual Hearts Afire Weekend celebration and appears at other city events.

<doc id="990422" wikidata="Q3589698" url="?curid=990422" title="England national rugby league team">
<text>The England national rugby league team represents England in international rugby league since the first international match in 1904. It is controlled by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the governing body for rugby league in England, and participated in the Rugby League World Cup and other test matches.

The England national team is the worlds oldest national rugby league team, having played the first international rugby league game in 1904 against Other Nationalities, a team initially made up of Welsh and Scottish players.

England have made the Rugby League World Cup final three times, being runners-up; in 1975, 1995 and 2017.

Shaun Wane is the head coach, and George Williams the captain.

== History ==

=== 1904–1995: Foundations and European Championships ===
For most of its history, England has been represented by the Great Britain national rugby league team in tours and world cups. The only competitive exception to this was the European Championship. England, in its early years, would also play regular friendlies against Wales to ensure the strength of the Great Britain side. The first international rugby league game was played by England in 1904. 

At the start of 1903–04 season the Northern Union thought about international matches and scheduled a match for England on New Year&#x27;s Day 1904 in Oldham. On that day though, the ground was frosty and the match was cancelled and it was rescheduled for April.

On 5 April 1904 England competed against a team called &quot;Other Nationalities&quot;, who were made up of ten Welshman and two Scotsman, including George Frater, who captained the side. It was a period of experimentation for the Northern Union and each team had twelve players, not thirteen. At Central Park, Wigan the ground was muddy and in poor condition, however the match went ahead. England steamed into a 3–0 lead, from a try by Warrington&#x27;s Jackie Fish. This is despite Salford&#x27;s James Lomas arriving late and causing England to start the match with eleven players. Fish missed the conversion and so the Other Nationalities were able to level the scores a little later, Welshman Thomas crashing over for a try. The conversion was missed and going into half-time the score was tied 3–3. In the second half Thomas went over for another try before Wigan&#x27;s Harris sealed a 9–3 win for the Other Nationalities in the final minutes of the match. A total of 6,000 spectators turned up for the match, which was considered a poor showing despite a Broughton Rangers v Bradford cup clash being scheduled on the same day.

In 1905 a match between the two sides was played at Bradford. This time England won 26–11 even though they were losing 11–0 at half-time. Wigan&#x27;s Jim Leytham scored four tries in succession, a record that still stand today. The match was played with fifteen players on each side and so was the 1906 match. Played in Wigan again, the match finished a 3–3 draw. The concept was abandoned after the 1906 match. By 1908 the game had expanded much more into Australia, New Zealand and Wales and England began playing those teams. Harold Wagstaff made his debut for England in 1908 against the touring Kangaroos team at 17 years and 228 days.

The Other Nationalities side did return in 1921.
An England side beat the Australasian team of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain 4–5 at Highbury. 
England played only one international between 10 May 1956 and 7 November 1968 an 18–6 victory at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds.

=== 1975 &quot;One-off&quot; World Cup ===

England played at the World Cup in 1975 coached by Alex Murphy, which was played over several months in both hemispheres on a league basis. Normally Great Britain would represent England in the World Cup, but the RLIF wanted to capitalise on the large number of Welsh players in the game at the time, and so England and Wales fielded separate teams.

England won their first match, a 20–2 victory over France in Leeds in March. In June the Lions suffered their first defeat in just their second match of the tournament, losing 12–7 against a strong Wales side in Brisbane. A little later England managed to hold on for a draw against Australia in Sydney, the final score being 10–10. And they also picked up a point in Auckland, drawing 17–17 against New Zealand. At the end of October, after the domestic season had finished, England beat the Welsh 22–16 in Warrington and then crossed the English Channel to thrash a French side 48–2 in Bordeaux. Bradford played host the England versus New Zealand match, in which England won comfortably 27–12.

At the start of November, England squeezed past Australia winning 16–13 in November at Wigan. This meant that the Kangaroos had finished on 13 points, with the Lions on 12 points. Australia were deemed champions by finishing top of the table, but because they had not beaten England a final match was quickly arranged. Australia beat England 25–0 at Leeds to clinch their fourth title.

=== 1995–2007: Regular World Cup appearances ===
==== 1995 World Cup ====
With the break up of the Great Britain team into its individual nations, England (as co-host) were in the 1995 World Cup, their first appearance in the World Cup since 1975. England were coached by Phil Larder. The Lions got off to a flying start beating Australia 20–16 in the opening game at Wembley, then hammering Fiji and South Africa in the remaining group games to finish top of group A. This set up a semi-final game at Old Trafford against Wales. England won the tussle 25–10 to reach the World Cup final, but they lost 16–8 to Australia at Wembley Stadium. England would not play again until 2000.

The 1995 World Cup saw the first change of the England strip in a number of years. Instead of the usual all-white kit, an offset red St George&#x27;s Cross was added to both the front and back of the jumper.

==== 2000 World Cup ====
John Kear was coach of England for the World Cup in 2000. Compared to 1995, England had little success, losing their opening game at Twickenham 22–2 against Australia. But they won their remaining two pool games against Fiji and Russia. A surprisingly competitive display by Ireland in the quarter-finals, saw England scrape through to the semi-finals 26–16. England then went down to a record defeat, losing 49–6 to New Zealand at Bolton, and were knocked out of the tournament.

=== 2007–present: Break up of Great Britain ===
Following the 2007 All Golds Tour, Great Britain splits into separate home nations teams meaning England would represent itself in all international rugby league competitions.

==== 2008–2009: Tony Smith era ====

Australian born, Tony Smith, took charge of England in 2008. His first game was against France in Toulouse where the English won 56–8. In his second game, England were missing St Helens and Leeds Rhinos players but the team still created history with a record 74–0 win over Wales in Doncaster. It was England&#x27;s biggest win recorded over the Welsh since 1978.

It was World Cup year, and Smith announced his ambitions that he wanted England to win their first World Cup, since 1972, when Great Britain represented the country at the event. In the event they were placed in Group A alongside hosts Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. England faced a scare in their opening game against Papua New Guinea, as Smith&#x27;s men were trailing 12–16 at halftime, but they did go on to win the game. England were humiliated in their second game against the hosts, suffering their biggest defeat to date, beating their 43-point margin against New Zealand eight years ago. In their final pool game against New Zealand, they produced a much better performance but for only 28 minutes, as they gave up a 24–8 lead to lose 24–36. Before, and during the match, England were accusing New Zealand of being soft, however, after the match, media outlets were calling England the biggest losers of the tournament. Controversy also occurred before the game kicked off, when England refused to face New Zealand&#x27;s haka challenge. Smith said &#x27;In some cultures poking your tongue out at others could be seen as insulting and the Kiwis pushed things too far by crossing into England&#x27;s side of halfway.&#x27; They took on New Zealand again in the semi-final. This time they never had the lead over the Kiwis, as they lost the match by 10 points. After rumours Smith would be sacked from his position, the RFL announced they&#x27;d keep faith in Smith for the remainder of his contract. The World Cup players took the blame for their performances.

After the World Cup nightmare, England began 2009 on a high-note with a record-breaking 54-point away win over France.

Later that year, England were co-hosts of the year&#x27;s major international tournament, the inaugural Four Nations. After thrashing them earlier in the year, England faced a shock half-time deficit in their opening game against a French side coached by former Great Britain international Bobbie Goulding. But despite trailing at the interval, England scored 30 consecutive points to record another victory over &#x27;Les Tricolores&#x27;. In the second match against Australia, England impressively kept Australia scoreless in the second half, and staged a second-half comeback. However it wasn&#x27;t enough, as Smith&#x27;s men needed to recover from a 26-point half-time deficit. They then took on New Zealand and, after losing to them twice at last year&#x27;s World Cup, England earned revenge with an 8-point win over the Kiwis. England then went on to make the final to face Australia. In the final England, at one point, led 16–14 and were credited with how they were able to produce a real contest. However, in the final quarter of the game, Australia dominated proceedings and eventually went on to win 46–16. On 16 November 2009, a few hours after crediting that the England national team had a bright future in rugby league, Smith resigned from the English national side.

==== 2010–2015: Steve McNamara era ====
Following Tony Smiths resignation, former Bradford Bulls head coach Steve McNamara was given the job. His first game in charge of England was against France in Leigh. England thrashed the French to keep their impressive winning run going over their opponents that dates back to 1981. McNamara also fielded the first brothers, Sam and Joel Tomkins, to start on the field for England since Paul and David Hulme represented Great Britain in 1989.

The following year, England co-hosted the 2011 Four Nations with Wales. Their opening game was a win against Wales where Sam Tomkins scored a record-equalling four tries in one game. The win meant England kept their impressive record of not losing on home soil against Wales since 1977. A loss the following week to Australia at Wembley meant that they had to beat New Zealand to make the final, which they did. In the final, England at one point were tied at 8–8, but they would be outclassed again. England were held &#x27;try-less&#x27; in the second half as Australia won by 22 points.

In mid-2012, the second International Origin series was held. The Exiles had won the first series in 2011 after Samoan International, George Carmont, scored a try with less than 40 seconds remaining to win the game for the Exiles. England won their first ever International Origin series game, after winning game 1 of the 2012 series, held in St Helens, by 8 points. However the Exiles would win the 2012 series after recording a bigger winning margin in game 2. In October and November that year, England competed in the Autumn Internationals where they took on Wales, and France. In their first game, England racked up their biggest points tally against Wales, as they thrashed &#x27;the Red Dragons&#x27; 80–12 in Wrexham. In their second game against France, fullback Sam Tomkins became England&#x27;s top try scorer when he scored his 14th try for England, breaking the record set by former Wigan and St Helens winger Alf Ellaby in 1935. In the final, England had a rematch with France at Salford City Stadium. England thrashed their opponents to win their first tournament title since the 2004 European Nations Cup.

In the lone 2013 International Origin game, England thrashed their opponents by 20 points. At the end of the year, the 2013 World Cup was held in England and Wales. England, who were now known as the &#x27;Wall of White&#x27;, featured a new record of three brothers in their squad: Sam and twins George and Tom Burgess. England played their first game against Australia in Cardiff. England got off to a surprising early lead for many, when they were up 10–0 after 20 minutes. England, however, went on to lose in what was one of their best displays against the Kangaroos in years, losing 20–28. They then went on to thrash Ireland to nil in front of a record crowd in Huddersfield, in a game which saw Ryan Hall become the new England top try-scorer after a hat-trick took him to tally 17 total tries for his country. England also beat a determined Fiji, in front a sold-out crowd at the KC Stadium, to advance to the quarter-finals. They took on European rivals, France, in Wigan and, after trailing 0–6 early, England went on to advance to the semi-finals to meet defending World Champions, New Zealand, at Wembley. The game was a see-saw affair, which saw England leading 18–14 with one minute on the clock remaining, until New Zealand play-maker Shaun Johnson produced a historical moment, to level the scores, and then convert his try after the siren, to win the match, and make the Kiwis advance to a third consecutive World Cup final. This was the first time England, or Great Britain, had lost to New Zealand in England since 2005.

In October and November 2014, England travelled down-under to play in the 2014 Four Nations. In the opening game, England took on Samoa in an affair which saw the lead change several times. In the end, England survived a shock result occurring after winning by 6 points. In the second game against Australia, controversy occurred. Australia led 16–12 with one minute left on the clock. England player, Liam Farrell, put a grubber-kick in the in-goal area, which forced Australian fullback, Greg Inglis, to force the ball dead, however, the video referees decided to have a look and see whether or not Inglis or the incoming Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays, it showed that Ryan Hall&#x27;s right hand&#x27;s little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball, however, in normal speed, it was deemed &#x27;inconclusive&#x27; by Australian officiating rules. It was eventually given a no-try to the anger of English players and fans. Ryan complained on Twitter, saying &quot;Looking at the video, I’d say it was a try if we’re playing Super League rules...&quot; Had Hall scored, and England converted, it would have been England&#x27;s first win over Australia since 1995, the first time Australia suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time Australia did not qualify for a tournament final since the 1954 World Cup final. England lost their final game against New Zealand and, in the process, ended any chance of qualifying for their first Four Nations final in the Southern Hemisphere.

In 2015, England took on New Zealand in a three match series held in England. Before the series, England recorded their biggest ever win over France, beating their previous 73–6 win in 1996. England beat New Zealand 2–1 in the Baskerville Series to retain the trophy that Great Britain last won in 2007. During that series vice-captain, James Graham, reached the milestone of becoming England&#x27;s most capped player, surpassing Kevin Sinfield&#x27;s record of 27 test appearances. Despite the series victory, McNamara was facing scrutiny beforehand and the RFL decided not to renew his contract which expired after the series. McNamara therefore left the England national team.

==== 2016–2019: Wayne Bennett era ====
Following McNamara&#x27;s contract expiration, the RFL appointed Australian Wayne Bennett on a 2-year contract, with a view to win the 2017 World Cup. Bennett&#x27;s first request as coach was for England to have a pre-season training camp, a mid-season international in 2017, as well as shortening the 2017 Super League season in order to prepare for the 2017 World Cup. RFL Chief Executive Nigel Wood accepted Bennett&#x27;s first two demands, but said shortening the domestic season is a &quot;big disturbance in lots of ways...&quot; Bennett&#x27;s plans suffered criticism from some professional club coaches.

Bennett&#x27;s first match was against France in Perpignan, in preparation for the 2016 Four Nations. Despite trailing, and being held scoreless in the first 26 minutes, England did go on to avoid an upset, convincingly beating the French and giving Bennett a successful return to the International scene, 8 years after he left the New Zealand assistant coach role. However England went onto having a disappointing Four Nations, losing the opening game to New Zealand, facing a scare against Scotland, before going on to lose a &#x27;must-win&#x27; game against Australia. This marked the first time that England failed to qualify for a Four Nations final while being hosts.

At the end of 2016, Bennett announced that the England pre-season &#x27;heat training camp&#x27; in Dubai would be cancelled after taking in the consideration of domestic coaches&#x27; concerns. Instead of a pre-season training camp, Bennett and the English coaching staff chose an Elite Performance Squad of players, based in England, who would be scouted regularly throughout the 2017 season. The squad trained six times throughout the season in England.

England&#x27;s first game of 2017 was a convincing result over Samoa, although Bennett came under criticism of his selections for the test-match. Former Great Britain captain Garry Schofield, along with other former players, media, and fans were angered by Bennett&#x27;s decision to include Australian born players Chris McQueen and Chris Heighington, who are eligible to play through their English fathers. Heighington&#x27;s age was also a talking point. At the age of 35, it was suggested younger players such as Liam Farrell, Alex Walmsley, Mark Percival, and Scott Taylor, should have been selected instead.

Bennett only named one NRL player, Chris Heighnington, in his England team for the World Cup, while Zak Hardaker missed out due to a drugs ban. England&#x27;s first game of the World Cup was against Australia. Although they were credited throughout the match for the way they were able to defend and prevent the Australians from dominating the game like they have in the past they again failed to beat Australia. Despite the defeat, England continued their way through the tournament with convincing victories over Lebanon, France, finishing second in Group A. They then went on to beat Papua New Guinea convincingly in the quarter finals before reaching the semi-finals where they would take on Tonga who had knocked New Zealand out the week before. England led 20–0, with seven minutes left on the clock, before the Tongans began an unpredictable and nerve-wracking comeback for England. With less than one minute left on the clock, Andrew Fifita lost control of the ball before regathering it and putting it over the try-line, only to realise the referee had already blown his whistle. The referee was criticised for not going to the Video Referee and if awarded would have seen that Tonga won the game and reached their first ever World Cup final. Despite the controversy, England were victorious and had advanced to their first World Cup final in 22 Years. England met Australia again in the final but again failed to beat Australia, for a 13th consecutive time, since their last win in the 1995 World Cup group stage. England lost in the lowest World Cup final score in the history of the tournament. Bennets contract expired at the end of the World Cup and despite not winning the tournament he was rewarded with another 2-year contract.

==== 2020–present: Shaun Wane era ====

On 3 February 2020, it was announced that Shaun Wane would replace Bennett as Head Coach on a two-year contract with the intention of leading England in the 2020 Ashes series and the 2021 World Cup.

England started the 2021 Rugby League World Cup with a 60-6 victory over Samoa and finished top of their group after winning all three pool matches. England would then defeat Papua New Guinea to reach the semi-final. In the semi-final, England would lose 27-26 against Samoa during golden point extra-time.
In October and November 2023, England played in the 2023 Tonga rugby league tour of England. England won the series 3-0.

== Identity ==
=== Kits and colours ===
England traditionally play in white, their early colours were white with red and gold stripes while later they played in white and red hoops. They occasionally play in a red away kit but colour clashes are rare and they rarely wear an away kit.

In the 1975 World Cup they played in a fully white kit. While they predominately played in white and red blue was also occasionally incorporated into the kit. It wasn&#x27;t until 1995 when the St George’s cross was first integrated into the kit.

Ahead of the 2021 World Cup a radical New England kit was released which was white with navy blue shoulders and cross.

=== Kit evolution ===
=== Kit suppliers and sponsors ===

* In a test match against France on 22 October 2016, Kingstone Press was replaced by Rugby to the Core due to the Evin law.

=== Badge ===
* The Lions crest

From the 1995 Rugby League World cup, it was used a crest with the St. George&#x27;s cross, the Three Lions Coat of Arms of England and Tudor rose. It was similar to most other English sporting badges, such as the England national football team and the English national cricket team which all promote similar attributes. Until the mid 1990s, England simply used a red lion rampant as crest.

* The Shield Crest

The new official logo was launched on 6 February 2008 on the rugby league magazine programme Boots N&#x27; All. The cross of St George is positioned across a three-dimensional shield within the design. The date &quot;1895&quot; is placed through the centre of the cross, symbolising the birth of rugby league. Many people involved in the sport were consulted throughout the design process, which took a little under a year. The logo was first used for the 2008 World Cup and was replaced in 2017.

* Three Lions Cross
As part of a rebrand across all of the RFL in 2017, a new England crest was introduced. It is a merge of both the shield crest and the old lions crest. It has the St. Georges cross on the background with three lions in front of it.

=== Media coverage ===

The BBC have the rights to screen all England games. They showed every game England competed in at the 2017 Rugby League World Cup, as well as all their Four Nations, and Baskerville Shield games. They also showed every game at the 2021 Rugby League World Cup in addition to women&#x27;s and wheelchair games.

=== Overall record ===
Below is a list of England&#x27;s head-to-head record as of 2 November 2024.
* Includes results from games against Exiles and Combined Nations All Stars.

=== World Cup ===
England have competed seven times in the World Cup; in 1975, 1995, 2000, 2008, 2013, 2017 and 2021. They have never won the competition, though finished runners-up to Australia in 1975, 1995 and 2017. In every other year, Great Britain have represented England. Despite having only played in 7 world cups, England have hosted matches in 8 different tournaments, including 3 that took part internationally. England have played 39 games in the world cup; winning 24, drawing 2 and losing 13. Of these losses, only two have been against a team other than New Zealand or Australia; Wales in 1975 and Samoa in 2021. England lost out on reaching the final in 2013, when New Zealand beat them 20-18 in the semi-final, after Shaun Johnson scored a conversion in the last 30 seconds of the game to secure the win. England reached the world cup final in 2017, but were beaten by Australia with a score of just 6–0.

As hosts of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, and as a team who reached the quarter finals in the previous world cup, England automatically qualified. They again reached the semi-final, but lost 27-26, on a golden point after extra time, to Samoa.

=== Four Nations ===

England replaced Great Britain in competing in the Rugby League Four Nations which replaced the previous Tri Nations tournament. They have been runners up twice, in 2009 and 2011. These two tournaments were hosted by England.

=== European Championship ===

England have competed in twenty-six European Nations Cups, the first in 1935. In the past the tournament has been axed and revived many times, and it was stopped for six years because of the Second World War. From 1935 to 1949 (minus the war years) England played France and Wales annually, and won the tournament in 1935, 1946, 1947 and 1948. From 1950 to 1956 an Other Nationalities team were added as the fourth team in the competition (except in 1956 when Wales did not field a team). During those years England won in 1950 and 1954. Since then the tournament has run for some seasons, but never for more than five years at a time. But from 1970 to 1996 England won it six out of a possible nine times. In 2003 the tournament was revived and England comfortably won, beating her old rivals plus Scotland, Ireland and Russia. England beat the same opponents to win the cup again in 2004. This was the last time England competed to give the competition more of a level playing field for other teams, however the England Knights competed in 2012.

In 2011 the England Knights were created to serve as a step up for the younger players from their club in view of playing for the 1st team. A squad of players were chosen (below the age of 25) to represent the Knights in a few games. Their first ever game was against France and the Knights came out 38–18 victors.

The Knights won the 2012 European Cup by beating Ireland and Scotland in a 3-game tournament.
