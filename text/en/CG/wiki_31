<text>Traditionalism, also sometimes known as Perennialism, posits the existence of a perennial wisdom or perennial philosophy, primordial and universal truths which form the source for, and are shared by, all the major world religions. Historian Mark Sedgwick identifies René Guénon, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Julius Evola, Mircea Eliade, Frithjof Schuon, Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Alexandr Dugin to be the seven most prominent Traditionalists.

==Concept==

According to representatives of Traditionalism, all major world religions are founded upon common primordial and universal metaphysical truths. The perspective of its authors is often referred to as &quot;philosophia perennis&quot; (perennial philosophy), which is both &quot;absolute Truth and infinite Presence&quot;. Absolute Truth is &quot;the perennial wisdom (&quot;sophia perennis&quot;) that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind&quot;. Infinite Presence is &quot;the perennial religion (&quot;religio perennis&quot;) that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions.&quot; According to Frithjof Schuon,
The Traditionalist vision of a perennial wisdom is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions. It is &quot;intuited directly through divine intellect&quot;. This divine intellect is different from reason, and makes it possible to discern &quot;the sacred unity of reality that is attested in all authentic esoteric expressions of tradition&quot;; it is &quot;the presence of divinity within each human waiting to be uncovered&quot;. According to Schuon:
For the Traditionalists, perennial philosophy has a transcendent dimension – Truth or Wisdom – and an immanent dimension – infinite Presence or Union. Thus, on the one hand, &quot;discernment between the Real and the unreal, or the Absolute and the relative&quot;, and on the other hand, &quot;mystical concentration on the Real&quot;.

According to the Traditionalists, this truth has been lost in the modern world through the rise of novel secular philosophies stemming from the Enlightenment, and modernism itself is considered an abnormality. Traditionalists see their approach as a justifiable longing for the past; in Schuon&#x27;s words: &quot;If to recognize what is true and just is &quot;nostalgia for the past&quot;, it is quite clearly a crime or a disgrace not to feel this nostalgia&quot;.

Traditionalists insist on the necessity for affiliation to one of the great religions of the world, without which no esoteric path is possible.

==People==

The ideas of Traditionalism are considered to begin with René Guénon. Other representatives of this school of thought include Ananda Coomaraswamy, Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, Hossein Nasr, William Stoddart, Jean-Louis Michon, Marco Pallis, Lord Northbourne, Huston Smith, Awadh Kishore Saran, Harry Oldmeadow, Reza Shah-Kazemi and Patrick Laude. Some academics include Julius Evola in this school, although Evola presents many differences in relation to those mentioned. Another author linked to perennialism is Mircea Eliade, although Eliade&#x27;s link is nuanced and often contested.

===René Guénon===
A major theme in the works of René Guénon (18861951) is the contrast between traditional world views and modernism, &quot;which he considered to be an anomaly in the history of mankind&quot;. For Guénon, the world is a manifestation of metaphysical principles, which are preserved in the perennial teachings of the world religions, but were lost to the modern world. For Guénon, &quot;the malaise of the modern world lies in its relentless denial of the metaphysical realm&quot;.

Early on, Guénon was attracted to Sufism, and in 1912 he was initiated in the Shadhili order. He started writing after his doctoral dissertation was rejected, and he left academia in 1923. His works center on the return to these traditional world views, trying to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy.

In his first books and essays, he envisaged a restoration of traditional &quot;intellectualité&quot; in the West on the basis of Roman Catholicism and Freemasonry. He gave up early on a purely Christian basis for a Traditionalist restoration of the West, searching for other traditions. He denounced the lure of Theosophy and neo-occultism in the form of Spiritism, two influential movements that were flourishing in his lifetime. In 1930, he moved to Egypt, where he lived until his death in 1951.

==Influence==
===In the East===
Through its close affiliation with Sufism, the Guénonian Traditionalist perspective has been gaining ground in Asia and the Islamic world at large.

====Iran====
In Iran, it was introduced by Hossein Nasr as well as, earlier, by Ali Shariati, the intellectual considered the ideologue of the Iranian Revolution who recommended Guénon to his students. While it never acquired a mass following, its influence on the elite can be measured by the fact that when Ayatollah Khomeini organized the Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution, out of the seven members designed to serve it, three were acquainted with Traditionalist ideas, namely Abdolkarim Soroush, Reza Davari Ardakani, and Nasrullah Pourjavady.

====Pakistan====
Hasan Askari, an important writer and literary critic, was directly influenced by Guénon, and, through him, Muhammad Shafi Deobandi and his son Muhammad Taqi Usmani, some of the country&#x27;s most influential Islamic scholars, integrated Guénon&#x27;s works in the curriculum of the Darul Uloom Karachi, one of the most important madrassa or religious seminaries in the country.

Other important figures of Pakistan influenced by Traditionalism include A. K. Brohi, who was seen as close to General Zia-ul-Haq and psychologist Muhammad Ajmal.

====Morocco====
The Budshishiyya order of Sufism, based in Morocco, is known to have strands influenced by Traditionalism.

===In the West===
====United Kingdom====
According to Mark Sedgwick, King Charles III, then Prince of Wales, was &quot;more of an anti-modernist than a Traditionalist, though [...] Traditionalist influences [were] increasingly visible in some of his speeches&quot;. The Temenos Academy, which has Charles as a patron, is associated with Traditionalism and perennialism.

====Far-right movements====
Julius Evola was an Italian Traditionalist influenced by Guénon but from whom he departed on many points, which did not allow him to be assimilated to Guénonian Traditionalism. The ideas of Evola have been associated with some far-right movements, such as the European &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; (&quot;New Right&quot;), and Italian Fascists during the Years of Lead.

Similarly, the Romanian Traditionalist Mircea Eliade had been a supporter of the Romanian Orthodox fascist Iron Guard.

According to Benjamin Teitelbaum, Savitri Devi, the founder of Esoteric Hitlerism, was influenced by both Guénon and Evola.

Mark Sedgwick&#x27;s &quot;Against the Modern World&quot;, published in 2004, gives an analysis of political traditionalism:
Various influential figures in twenty-first century far-right populist movements have affiliated with Traditionalism, often with Evola in particular. According to Benjamin R. Teitelbaum: Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, informal adviser to Vladimir Putin, Aleksandr Dugin, Brazilian writer Olavo de Carvalho, as well as Tibor Baranyi, the one time adviser to the Hungarian Jobbik conservative political party, all have associated with Traditionalism and have interacted with each other based on those interests. Carvalho denies this association.

Alain de Benoist, the founder of the French Nouvelle Droite, declared in 2013 that the influence of Guénon on his political school was very weak and that he does not consider him a major author for his work.

<doc id="983458" wikidata="Q2635126" url="?curid=983458" title="Waterfall (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Waterfall () is a lithograph by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in October 1961. It shows a perpetual motion machine where water from the base of a waterfall appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall.

While most two-dimensional artists use relative proportions to create an illusion of depth, Escher here and elsewhere uses conflicting proportions to create a visual paradox. The watercourse supplying the waterfall (its aqueduct or leat) has the structure of three Penrose triangles. A Penrose triangle is an impossible object designed by Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934, and found independently by Roger Penrose in 1958.

==Description==
The image depicts a watermill with an elevated aqueduct and waterwheel as the main feature. The aqueduct begins at the waterwheel and flows behind it. The walls of the aqueduct step downward, suggesting that it slopes downhill. The aqueduct turns sharply three times, first to the left, then to the right, and finally to the left again. The viewer looks down at the scene diagonally, which means that from the viewer&#x27;s perspective the aqueduct appears to be slanted upward. The viewer is also looking across the scene diagonally from the lower right, which means that from the viewer&#x27;s perspective the two left-hand turns are directly in line with each other, while the waterwheel, the forward turn and the end of the aqueduct are all in line. The second left-hand turn is supported by pillars from the first, while the other two corners are supported by a tower of pillars that begins at the waterwheel. The water falls off the edge of the aqueduct and over the waterwheel in an impossible infinite cycle; in his notes on the picture, Escher points out that some water must be periodically added to this perpetual motion machine to compensate for evaporation. The use of the Penrose stairs is paralleled by Escher&#x27;s &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; (1960), where instead of the flow of water, two lines of monks endlessly march uphill or downhill around the four flights of stairs.

The two support towers continue above the aqueduct and are topped by two compound polyhedra, revealing Escher&#x27;s interest in mathematics as an artist. The one on the left is a compound of three cubes. The one on the right is a stellation of a rhombic dodecahedron (or a compound of three non-regular octahedra) and is known as Escher&#x27;s solid.

Below the mill is a garden of bizarre, giant plants. This is a magnified view of a cluster of moss and lichen that Escher drew in ink as a study in 1942.

The background seems to be a climbing expanse of terraced farmland.

<text>Welcome to the Freak Show is a live audio and video recording by DC Talk. Chronicling the Jesus Freak Tour in the spring of 1996, they were released separately two months apart in 1997 on CD and VHS, respectively. A DVD version was later released in 2003. Each version has been certified gold by the RIAA (audio for 500,000 units and video for 50,000 units sold). Track listings differ slightly between the two. Select videos included a bonus audio disc that remains one of the rarest recordings in the DC Talk catalog. The audio version won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album.

== Release dates ==
* VHS June 17, 1997
* CD August 26, 1997
* DVD October 21, 2003

== Jesus Freak Tour ==
&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; released in November 1995 to first-week sales of 85,000 units, a record for a Christian album at the time. This placed it at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Anticipation was already high for the scheduled 65-city tour set to begin in the Spring of 1996, but DC Talk&#x27;s record label, ForeFront Records launched a massive marketing blitz to increase awareness. The tour debuted to a sold-out crowd at the Bren Center on the University of California Irvine campus. It later included stops in several European countries (which is documented in the video). Audio Adrenaline opened for DC Talk on the tour.

== Audio version ==
The audio version was recorded in the Pacific Northwest, more specifically in Portland, Oregon and Tacoma, Washington, as evidenced by the band dialogue in several places, such as following &quot;Like It, Love It, Need It&quot; (Michael and Kevin banter about what they like about Seattle). Of notable absence is &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; which was the album&#x27;s biggest mainstream hit. This song&#x27;s rise on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts was a result of the partnership with Virgin Records that came after the close of the tour. &quot;Between You and Me&quot; was not played until the last dates of the tour, which was after this recording had taken place.

===Track listing===
=== Awards and recognition ===
The audio recording was awarded the 1997 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Rock Gospel Album&quot;. It was certified gold by the RIAA (500,000 units sold) on October 25, 2000.

== VHS version ==

=== Track listing ===
# &quot;Help!&quot; (The Beatles cover)
# &quot;So Help Me God&quot;
# &quot;Luv Is a Verb&quot;
# &quot;Colored People&quot;
# &quot;Like It, Love It, Need It&quot;
# &quot;What If I Stumble&quot;
# &quot;In the Light&quot; 
# &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;
# &quot;Day by Day&quot;
# &quot;Walls/Time Is...&quot;
# &quot;Alas, My Love&quot;
# &quot;The Hardway&quot;
# &quot;Jesus Freak&quot;

=== Description ===
The video was filmed in a variety of U.S. locations. This is evidenced by the band members wearing different clothes within the same songs. Footage was obviously spliced together. As with the audio version, dc Talk&#x27;s mainstream hit &quot;Between You and Me&quot; had yet to be added to the set list at the time of recording. &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; were left off the video recording due to time constraints. The video, however, added short segments between songs that were filmed at various stops in Europe.

=== Awards and recognition ===
The video was certified gold by the RIAA (50,000 units sold) on March 2, 1998.

== DVD Version ==

=== Track listing ===
The DVD has the main feature of the VHS versions but adds the following bonus features:
# &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; (music video)
# &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; (music video)
# &quot;Colored People&quot; (music video)

== Bonus disc ==
Included with an extremely select number of videos in 1997 was a four-song bonus disc. The cover reads &quot;Limited Edition EP&quot; although is more commonly called the &quot;Freak Show Bonus Disc&quot; among collectors of dc Talk&#x27;s more rare releases. It contains the extremely rare release of &quot;Colored People (Organic Mix)&quot;.

=== Track listing ===
# &quot;In the Light&quot; (Welcome to the Freak Show Live Version)
# &quot;Day by Day&quot; (Welcome to the Freak Show Live Version)
# &quot;Colored People&quot; (Organic Mix)
# &quot;What Have We Become?&quot; (Jesus Freak Album Version)

<text>NGC 5078 is a spiral galaxy in the Hydra constellation, approximately 94 million light-years away from Earth. It has a diameter of 127,000 light-years and is probably a member of the NGC 5061 group. The dust lane of NGC 5078 is warped, probably by interaction with the nearby galaxy IC 879, which is itself distorted into an &#x27;S&#x27; shape by the interaction. At the presumed distance the two galaxies would have a minimal separation of about 61,000 light-years. For comparison, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years from the Milky Way.

NGC 5078 is also only separated in the sky from the spiral galaxy NGC 5101 by about 0.5 degrees, and both are believed to be at the same distance from the Earth. This would mean they are approximately 800,000 light-years apart.

One supernova has been observed in NGC 5078: SN 1999cz (type Ic, mag. 16).

He moved to Los Angeles and spent the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s as a member of orchestras led by Bill Holman and Bob Florence. He toured and recorded with Dave Brubeck from 1982 to 2012.

<text>Hamid Reza Dastmalchi () is an Iranian-American professional poker player.

Dastmalchi finished in fifth place in the 1985 WSOP Main Event for a total prize of $70,000. Dastmalchi won the 1992 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, which is his largest tournament win with a prize of $1 million. He again made the final table of the Main Event in 1995, finishing in fourth place.

Dastmalchi was involved in a legal dispute in 1999 with Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe after the new management would not let him cash in $865,000 in chips he had won under the prior management. A gaming commission ultimately ruled the chips should be cashed.

In his career, Dastmalchi has won three WSOP bracelets, his last victory coming in 1993.

Dastmalchi&#x27;s last major tournament cash came in 2002 in the World Poker Tour Five Diamond World Poker Classic.

Although he rarely plays in tournaments anymore, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,800,000 as of 2009, with his ten cashes at the WSOP accounting for $1,600,760 of those winnings.

<text>NGC 5189 (Gum 47, IC 4274, nicknamed Spiral Planetary Nebula) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Musca. It was discovered by James Dunlop on 1 July 1826, who catalogued it as Δ252. For many years, well into the 1960s, it was thought to be a bright emission nebula. It was Karl Gordon Henize in 1967 who first described NGC 5189 as quasi-planetary based on its spectral emissions.

Seen through the telescope it seems to have an &quot;S&quot; shape, reminiscent of a barred spiral galaxy. The &quot;S&quot; shape, together with point-symmetric knots in the nebula, have for a long time hinted to astronomers that a binary central star is present. 
The Hubble Space Telescope imaging analysis showed that this &quot;S&quot; shape structure is indeed two dense low-ionization regions: one moving toward the north-east and another one moving toward the south-west of the nebula, which could be a result of a recent outburst from the central star. Observations with the Southern African Large Telescope have finally found a white dwarf companion in a 4.04 day orbit around the rare low-mass Wolf-Rayet type central star of NGC 5189. NGC 5189 is estimated to be 546 parsecs or 1,780 light years away from Earth. Other measurements have yielded results up to 900 parsecs (~3000 light-years).

<doc id="983485" wikidata="Q221028" url="?curid=983485" title="Lisa's Wedding">
<text>&quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; is the nineteenth episode of the sixth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 19, 1995. The plot focuses on Lisa visiting a carnival fortune teller and learning about her future love in the far-off future of 2010. It was written by Greg Daniels and directed by Jim Reardon. Mandy Patinkin guest stars as Hugh Parkfield and Phil Hartman guest stars as Troy McClure. The episode won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Animated Program, becoming the third episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to win the award.

==Plot==
The Simpson family visit a Renaissance fair, where Lisa finds a fortune-telling booth. The clairvoyant says she will predict Lisa&#x27;s future and tell the story of her true love.

In the year 2010 – 15 years in the future – 23-year-old Lisa meets a fellow university student named Hugh Parkfield from London. The pair fall madly in love and soon plan to marry. Lisa and Hugh travel to Springfield, where they plan to hold the wedding. Marge is still a housewife; 25-year-old Bart is twice-divorced and works as a building demolition expert while planning on going to law school; 16-year-old Maggie apparently never stops speaking (although she never talks in the episode, and whenever she tries to she is interrupted); and Homer still works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, with Milhouse as his supervisor.

Despite Lisa&#x27;s hopes, Hugh does not get along with her family, and is particularly dismayed when Homer wants him to wear family-tradition cufflinks resembling pigs on his wedding day. Lisa begs Hugh to wear the cufflinks, and he agrees on the condition that Lisa abandon her family after the wedding because Hugh is deeply embarrassed by them (although he agrees to let Marge visit once they have children). Outraged, Lisa insists she cannot marry him if he cannot understand that she loves her family members – despite their shortcomings – and calls off the wedding. Hugh returns to England and never sees Lisa again.

In the present, Lisa questions the fortune-teller about her &quot;true love&quot; and the fortune-teller reveals that although Lisa will have a true love, she specializes in foretelling doomed romances. Lisa leaves the booth and finds Homer, who is excited to tell her about his day at the fair.

==Production==
The episode was written by Greg Daniels and directed by Jim Reardon. The idea for the episode came from James L. Brooks, who called David Mirkin and pitched the idea as traveling to the future and Lisa meeting the perfect guy, who in turn cannot stand her family. Believing that it would be a tough episode to write, Brooks gave the job to Greg Daniels, who was enthusiastic about it and has said that it was a lot easier and more fun to write than expected. The plot involving Homer&#x27;s cuff links was not in the original draft; it was later added because the writers felt that something was needed to represent Hugh&#x27;s disdain for the Simpson family. The end theme was redone by Alf Clausen as a &quot;Renaissance version&quot;, including a harp.
Everything in the episode had to be redesigned, including the sets and all the characters. In most cases, the adults were made older, heavier, had a few lines added to the face, and less hair. On Homer, the redesign was minimal, making him a bit heavier, removing one hair and placing an extra line under the eye. In the future, Lisa has frilled, pointed hair, Marge with slightly grayer blue hair, Bart has a beard line like his father, Homer is stouter and even balder, with only one hair on his head and the one wrapping around thinning, and Krusty looks like Groucho Marx. The night sky was intentionally made a more reddish color in a subtle joke about how the producers thought the world would be much more polluted in 2010. Nancy Cartwright&#x27;s Bart voice was electronically lowered a couple of notches.

This is the first of five future-themed episodes. It was followed by &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; in season 11, &quot;Future-Drama&quot; in season 16, &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; in season 23, and &quot;Days of Future Future&quot; in season 25. While both &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Future-Drama&quot; were nominated for an Emmy, in 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Bart to the Future&quot; the worst episode in the history of the series.

==Cultural references==
The episode makes mention of &quot;40 classic films starring Jim Carrey&quot; in 2010. According to David Mirkin, this is a joke about how &quot;huge&quot; Carrey&#x27;s films were at the time, and how he was not garnering much respect as an actor. Lisa wandering away from the Renaissance fair while following a rabbit is similar to the plot of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures In Wonderland&quot;. The sounds of the car are the same as the ones used in &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. On Lisa&#x27;s wall there is a poster of Rolling Stones &quot;Steel Wheelchair Tour 2010&quot;. Wrist communicators are using the same sounds as communicators in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In this episode&#x27;s version of the future, apparently three of the major American television networks have been bought by ABC and merged into CNNBCBS. Hugh Parkfield is a parody of English actor Hugh Grant. The beginning of Lisa and Hugh&#x27;s romance is similar to the one in the 1970 film &quot;Love Story&quot;. Martin Prince&#x27;s fate is a parody of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The song that he plays on the organ is a variation of &quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot; by Walter Murphy, a disco version of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; in C Minor. Hugh mentions that he and Lisa are &quot;both utterly humorless about our vegetarianism&quot;; in the next season&#x27;s episode, &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian,&quot; Lisa does indeed become a vegetarian and remains one for subsequent episodes.

==Reception and legacy==
In its original broadcast, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; finished 52nd in ratings for the week of March 13–19, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 9.1, equivalent to approximately 8.7 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

&quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Animated Program, becoming the third episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to win in the category. This episode is a favorite of James L. Brooks, who believes that it is one of the best-written episodes and ranks near the top of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episodes. The emotion of &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; is often compared with season two&#x27;s &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;.

Mandy Patinkin as Hugh is considered one of the best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest spots by Chris Turner in his book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, who says that many of the best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars have been lesser known celebrities. In a 2008 article, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Patinkin one of the 16 best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars. In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed it as the first in its list of top twelve episodes, calling it &quot;the premier example of what makes a &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode work.&quot; In 2007, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; characterized the episode as one of &quot;The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes&quot;.

On August 1, 2010, the day of Lisa&#x27;s wedding in the episode, the name &quot;Lisa Simpson&quot; was a trending topic on Twitter. Most of the Twitter users that tweeted her name wished her a happy wedding day.

<text>NGC 5195 (also known as Messier 51b or M51b) is a dwarf galaxy that is interacting with the Whirlpool Galaxy (also known as M51a or NGC 5194). Both galaxies are located approximately 25 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. Together, the two galaxies are one of the most famous interacting galaxy pairs.

==History==

NGC 5195 was discovered by Pierre Méchain on March 20, 1781.

==Interaction with the Whirlpool Galaxy==

NGC 5195 and the Whirlpool Galaxy compose one of the most noted interacting galaxy pairs in astronomy. The two galaxies are listed in the &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot; as one of several prominent examples of a spiral galaxy with a companion galaxy. The system was also the subject of very early theoretical investigations into galaxy interactions. The two galaxies are connected by a dust-rich tidal bridge. The dust in this tidal bridge can be seen silhouetted against the center of NGC 5195. This demonstrates that NGC 5195 appears to lie behind the Whirlpool Galaxy. The encounter has significantly enhanced the spiral structure of M51.
A three-pronged structure extends from NGC 5195. The middle prong seems to be bluer than the other prongs, suggesting that this feature is an extension of the Whirlpool Galaxy’s tidal tails. The structure leads to several massive plumes and streams of stars produced by the interaction with the aforementioned grand-design spiral galaxy. One massive plume is called the &quot;Northwest Plume&quot;. However, diffuse high-speed gas within the plume suggests an origin within the Whirlpool Galaxy and not NGC 5195. The Northwest plume partially overlaps and blends it with two stellar streams extending from NGC 5195. Unlike the northwest plume, the stellar streams are bifurcated and similar in color to NGC 5195. A 2015 study observing the Whirlpool galaxy and its companion found two new and very faint tidal structures. One of them is called the &quot;South Plume&quot; while the other one is called the &quot;Northeast Plume&quot;.

In January 2016, BBC science reporter Jonathan Webb said, &quot;Astronomers have spotted two huge waves of gas being &#x27;burped&#x27; by the black hole at the heart of a nearby galaxy. The swathes of hot gas, detected in X-ray images from NASA&#x27;s Chandra space telescope, appear to be sweeping cooler hydrogen gas ahead of them. This vast, rippling belch is taking place in NGC 5195 – a small, neglected sibling of the &#x27;Whirlpool Galaxy&#x27;, 26 million light years away. That makes it one of the closest black holes blasting gas in this way&quot;. He added, &quot;The findings, presented at the 227th meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) in Florida, are a dramatic example of &#x27;feedback&#x27; between a supermassive black hole and its host galaxy&quot;. Webb&#x27;s report cited Marie Machacek, co-author of the study from the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CFA), as saying, &quot;We think that feedback keeps galaxies from becoming too large ... But at the same time, it can be responsible for how some stars form. This shows that black holes can create, not just destroy.&quot;

==Morphology==

As a consequence of the gravitational interaction with the Whirlpool Galaxy, NGC 5195 is highly distorted. Classification of its morphology is difficult, as it is sometimes identified as a lenticular galaxy or as an amorphous or irregular galaxy. It has been described as falling outside the standard morphological classification system.

==Supernova==
SN 1945A is the only supernova that has been detected within NGC 5195. It was found 10″ northwest of the nucleus on April 6, 1945, by Milton L. Humason using the telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. The supernova, classified as a Type I supernova, reached a peak apparent magnitude of 14.0.

<doc id="983517" wikidata="Q536757" url="?curid=983517" title="Miura Peninsula">
<text>is a peninsula located in Kanagawa, Japan. It lies south of Yokohama and Tokyo and divides Tokyo Bay, to the east, from Sagami Bay, to the west. Cities and towns on the Miura Peninsula include Yokosuka, Miura, Hayama, Zushi, and Kamakura. The northern limit of the peninsula runs from Koshigoe, Kamakura in the west, across to Mt. Enkai, in the southern wards of Yokohama in the east, overlooking Tokyo Bay.

==Overview==
The peninsula is a bedroom community for those who work in Tokyo and a popular tourist destination for people from Tokyo. It is also an important area for Japan&#x27;s self-defense, with the eastern side hosting the National Defense Academy of Japan and the Yokosuka Naval Base, serving both the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force and the United States Seventh Fleet.

A significant portion of Tokyo&#x27;s electricity is generated at Tokyo Electric&#x27;s power station at Kurihama, and important R&amp;D activity on next-generation mobile phones is done at Yokosuka Research Park.

== Three lighthouses ==
There are three important lighthouses on Miura Peninsula. Kannonzaki Lighthouse stands at the easternmost tip of the peninsula, facing Cape Futtsu across the bay. At Cape Tsurugi on the eastern side of the southernmost tip of the peninsula is the Tsurugisaki Lighthouse, one of Japan&#x27;s oldest western style lighthouses, first illuminated in 1871. On the island of Jōgashima, off the southernmost and western tip of the peninsula, stands the Jōgashima Lighthouse.

<doc id="983518" wikidata="Q2160532" url="?curid=983518" title="Rock the Vote">
<text>Rock the Vote is a non-profit organization in the United States. Through registering new young voters, the group aims to &quot;channel the energy among young people around racial, economic, and health justice into one of the most powerful actions they can take: voting.&quot;

The organization was founded in 1990 by Virgin Records America Co-Chairman Jeff Ayeroff to encourage young Americans to vote. It is geared toward increasing voter turnout among voters ages 18 to 24. Rock the Vote is known for its celebrity spokespeople and its partnership with MTV.

==History==
Rock the Vote was founded in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff with Virgin America co-chair Jordan Harris and Virgin executive Beverly Lund. Later, they hired Jodi Uttal and then Steve Barr, a campaign worker and political fundraiser, who became co-founders for their contribution to Rock the Vote.

Initially, Rock the Vote delivered its voter registration message by staffing tents at music festivals and concerts.

In 1991, their message was broadcast on MTV with Madonna&#x27;s Rock the Vote Public Service Announcements (PSA) where she literally wrapped herself in the American flag. That same year, Barr, on behalf of Rock the Vote, testified before Congress to support pending voter registration legislation.

Rock the Vote supported the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, commonly referred to as the &quot;motor voter&quot; bill, which expanded access to voter registration. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law requires state governments to offer voter registration opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver&#x27;s license or public assistance.

In 1996, Rock the Vote created the first telephone voter registration system, 1-800-REGISTER, followed by the first online voter-registration system, NetVote, later that year.

&quot;We supported Rock the Vote&quot;, said Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke, &quot;but – because of the way the whole political system works – it does seem rather odd to be choosing between one unworkable, outdated system and another. We need to go beyond that – because, at the moment, it&#x27;s just Cowboys and Indians&quot;.

With CNN, Rock the Vote organized &quot;America Rocks the Vote&quot;, a 2003 Democratic presidential candidates forum at Faneuil Hall in Boston.

Rock the Vote has expressed support for a public health insurance option. It signed on to Health Care for America NOW!, a progressive political coalition that supported passage of the Affordable Care Act. In 2009, Rock the Vote ran a campaign encouraging people to refuse to have sex with those who opposed what they regarded as a reform of American health care.

During the 2004 presidential election, Rock the Vote drew criticism from Republican Party officials such as Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie for sending a mock draft notice to over 600,000 e-mail addresses. The message included the words &quot;Selective Service System&quot; and read &quot;You are hereby ordered for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States, and to report to a polling place near you&quot; on November 2 (Election Day). The Rock the Vote logo and a facsimile of Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s signature appeared at the bottom of the message. In addition, Rock the Vote created public service announcements featuring the subject of the draft. Besides making the PSAs available to large cable systems, they paid to run them on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18- to 19-year-olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Rock the Vote experienced financial problems in the aftermath of the 2004 election. It emerged from the election $700,000 in debt, and its president resigned in summer 2005 &quot;amid disagreements about the organization&#x27;s direction&quot;. In 2008, Rock the Vote&#x27;s youth vote registration drive resulted in 2.6 million young voters registered.

In November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends &quot;liked&quot; the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads. In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.

In advance of the 2014 elections, Rock the Vote released a video titled &quot;Turn Out For What&quot;. It was a parody of Lil Jon and DJ Snake&#x27;s song &quot;Turn Down for What&quot;. The video sought to encourage youth voter turnout and featured reproductive rights, marijuana legalization, global warming, LGBT rights, student debt, gun control, and deforestation as reasons why young Americans might want to vote. The video was criticized for having a disproportionate representation of left-wing political issues. The video was also criticized because several of the celebrities who appeared in it, including Lena Dunham, Whoopi Goldberg, Natasha Lyonne, and Darren Criss, had not voted in the previous midterm election.

The day after the 2016 US presidential election, Rock the Vote President and Executive Director Carolyn DeWitt issued a statement on behalf of the organization expressing disappointment with the election of Donald Trump and Republican Party congressional victories, writing &quot;This is a jarring day for Millennial voters, who voted overwhelmingly for Secretary Clinton and for progressive candidates down the ticket...we woke up this morning with full hearts and piercing focus, not just on the next national election in two short years, but on putting the needs of young Americans, people of color and others feeling under siege, front and center for our new president and the 115th Congress&quot;. In 2019, DeWitt spoke out in favor of abolishing the United States Electoral College.

==Democracy Class==
Rock the Vote: Democracy Class is a program put on by Rock the Vote. It is designed to educate high school students about voting, elections, and governance. The lesson plan uses music, pop culture, video, classroom discussion, and a mock election to teach young Americans about elections. On Democracy Day 2011, teachers in all 50 states committed to teaching Democracy Class in more than 1,100 classrooms. High school students in Democracy Classes participate in mobile polls that assess their viewpoints on public policy issues.

== Brands for Democracy ==

(operates the brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and The Habit), and Zumiez.

== Athletes Rock the Vote ==

<text>Zanshin () is a state of awareness; of relaxed alertness, in Japanese martial arts. A literal translation of &quot;zanshin&quot; is &quot;remaining mind&quot;.

In several martial arts, &quot;zanshin&quot; refers specifically to the body&#x27;s posture after a technique is executed.

==In various martial arts==
In &quot;kyūdō&quot;, &quot;zanshin&quot; means the body posture after the loosing of an arrow; the posture is intended to reflect the higher meaning of &quot;zanshin&quot;, which is a mental aspect maintained before, during, &quot;and&quot; after an action.

In &quot;karate&quot;, &quot;zanshin&quot; is the state of total awareness. It means being aware of one&#x27;s surroundings and enemies, while being prepared to react. 

In the context of &quot;kendō&quot;, &quot;zanshin&quot; is the continued state of spirit, mental alertness and physical readiness to meet the situation (such as an opposing attack) that must be maintained when one returns to &quot;kamae&quot; after attacking. It is one of the essential elements that define a good attack.

During the practice of &quot;aikidō&quot;, the usual method of practicing &quot;zanshin&quot; is to focus on the just-thrown &quot;uke&quot;, or opponent, while holding &quot;kamae&quot; and maintaining awareness in case there are additional attacks or attackers. In Iwama Style training, zanshin is practiced as general awareness of one&#x27;s surroundings, of which uke is just a small part. In Yōseikan-style aikidō, students are trained to maintain that continued state of mental awareness and physical readiness beyond the dōjō walls and into daily life.

<text>O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits is a greatest hits album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released in 2002 by Columbia Records and Geffen Records. A double-disc album, it includes 27 of the band&#x27;s biggest hits in chronological order and spans the band&#x27;s entire career to that point, but does not include any songs from the albums &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot;, or &quot;Done With Mirrors&quot;. Aerosmith&#x27;s collaboration with Run-DMC on &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, however, is included, as are two new songs, &quot;Girls of Summer&quot; and &quot;Lay It Down&quot;, which the band recorded in Hawaii.

&quot;O, Yeah!&quot; has since been certified triple platinum in the United States. Noticeable on the corners of album cover are the different variations of the Aerosmith logo used throughout the band&#x27;s career.

&quot;O, Yeah!&quot; was re-released as TheEssential Aerosmith on September 13, 2011. The album cover was changed, with a more straightforward profile picture of the band being used, and a limited edition bonus disc with six additional tracks was released, otherwise the track listing to the two CDs are the same.

<text>Williston Northampton School (simply referred to as Williston) is a private, co-educational, day and boarding college-preparatory school in Easthampton, Massachusetts, United States. It was established in 1841.

== History ==

Williston Seminary was founded by Samuel Williston (1795–1874), a wealthy button manufacturer, in February 1841; the school opened that December, with a dedication address by Mark Hopkins, president of nearby Williams College. The idea of opening a new academy in the neighborhood had been in the air ever since the closing in 1834 of the Round Hill School in nearby Northampton. In its early days, there was no arrangement of studies by terms and the students were not classified. Luther Wright, its principal from 1841 to 1849, believed it was desirable to have his pupils study together in a single room under his direction. However, the school&#x27;s student population grew rapidly and the one-room schoolhouse scheme was soon no longer practicable as more instructors and new buildings were added. By the 1850s, the schools campus was dominated by three large buildings: North Hall, Middle Hall and South Hall. For many years, the school was co-educational, with the students divided and taught separately in male and female departments, but in 1864, the female division was discontinued.

The seminary comprised two faculties: classical and scientific. With the departure in 1863 of the school&#x27;s second president, Josiah Clark, a classicist Greek and Latin scholar who had vigorously fought against the expansion of the English department, the school&#x27;s curriculum began to be modernized. Samuel Williston remained the dominant influence in the school&#x27;s growth until his death in 1874. In the late 19th century, the dual curricula had evolved into a more modern comprehensive course (e.g. with &quot;scientific and preparatory departments&quot;), and in 1924 the school was renamed Williston Academy. During the 1960s, Williston began to examine possibilities for coeducation and in 1971, merged with its longtime sister school, the Northampton School for Girls, to become the Williston Northampton School. Starting as a preparatory academy for those seeking the clergy, the school now has a core college preparatory curriculum.

== Students and faculty ==

Williston Northampton encompasses the middle school (7th and 8th grade) and the upper school (9th-12th and postgraduate).

The school had 486 students in the 2017-2018 academic year with 58.6 teachers on a full-time equivalent basis, and a student–teacher ratio of 8.3. Its boarding students come from 25 states and 30 countries around the world. International students come from eastern Asia, the Middle East and Europe.

== The campus ==

The campus is located in Easthampton, Massachusetts, within view of Mount Tom.

Many of the school&#x27;s buildings and dorms are situated around the main quad. In 2017, construction began on a new dorm across from the main part of campus. The Schoolhouse, a former factory building remodeled in the 1950s to resemble the old schoolhouse building on the original Main Street campus, holds English and math classes and also contains administrative offices. In 1996, the former gymnasium, originally built in 1924, was transformed into the Reed Campus Center. In 2019, the athletic center was named the Sabina Cain Family Athletic Center. The Dodge Room is the setting for many guest speakers, including the school&#x27;s Writers&#x27; Workshop series.

After a fire destroyed the school&#x27;s theater building in 1994, it was rebuilt adjacent to the science laboratories, Scott Hall. The Williston Theatre is a 250-seat performance space.

The Robert Clapp Memorial Library is located near the center of the campus. The library has a 40,000+ collection.

The Middle School is housed in the Whitaker-Bement Center. It was created in 1972 in honor of the Northampton School for Girls founders Sarah B. Whitaker and Dorothy M. Bement. The Phillips Stevens Chapel (1964) hosts both the weekly assembly in its traditional chapel and language classes in its basement.

== Tuition ==
Tuition for the 2023-2024 academic year is $74,000 for boarding students, and $51,000 for day students. Tuition for the middle school is $41,000.

<text>Machuca is a 2004 internationally co-produced coming-of-age drama film co-written and directed by Andrés Wood. It stars Matías Quer, Ariel Mateluna, Manuela Martelli, and Aline Küppenheim alongside Federico Luppi.

Set in Santiago during the months leading up to the 1973 coup d&#x27;état led by General Augusto Pinochet – which overthrew Salvador Allende&#x27;s socialist government – the film tells the story of two boys who attend an elite Catholic school: Gonzalo Infante – who belongs to a wealthy family with a European background – and Pedro Machuca – who is poor and comes from an indigenous background.

The film is inspired by and dedicated to Father Gerardo Whelan, C.S.C. who from 1969 to 1973 was the director of Saint George&#x27;s College, the private school depicted in the film, which the director himself attended as a boy. &quot;Machuca&quot; was filmed in July 2003 and produced on a moderate budget of US$1,700,000. It is a joint Chilean-Spanish-British-French international co-production with support from Ibermedia. Production companies included Andrés Wood Producciones, Tornasol Films, Mamoun Hassan, Paraíso, and Chile Films.

The film premiered in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight parallel section of the 57th Cannes Film Festival in May 2004. It was well received in theaters in Chile and a few other countries, but did not have notable box office success outside of Latin America.

==Plot==
The story is told from the viewpoint of Gonzalo Infante, a 12-year-old upper-class boy, and it is set in a turbulent time in Chile. The working class was demanding social justice and significant changes to the country&#x27;s socioeconomic structure after electing a socialist president. In this context, the wealthy classes became afraid of the socialist movement, and some of its most prominent members conspired against the government of Salvador Allende.

While Gonzalo&#x27;s father is sympathetic to the less fortunate and not part of the right-wing movement, he wants to take his family to Italy, where he often travels for his work at the UN FAO. Gonzalo&#x27;s mother, on the other hand, is resigned to the state of affairs and is having an affair with a wealthy and much older Argentinean.

Gonzalo attends a private school where the determined school principal, Father McEnroe, has initiated a social integration project. However, some of the parents consider it a &quot;leftist venture&quot; instead of a Christian, charitable effort. When five disadvantaged students are admitted to Gonzalo&#x27;s class, he befriends Pedro because he sympathizes with him after some wealthy classmates bully him.

Gonzalo joins Pedro and his neighbor Silvana in selling flags and cigarettes during street demonstrations. They first sell nationalist flags at a right-wing protest and later socialist flags at a leftist rally supporting the government. Silvana initially calls Gonzalo a snob and &quot;strawberry-face,&quot; but eventually, they develop affection for each other and even share a kiss.

Pedro visits Gonzalo&#x27;s home and is amazed by the fact that Gonzalo has a room to himself, filled with toys and a closet full of clothes. However, he also witnesses the tension and cruelty that exists within Gonzalo&#x27;s family. When Gonzalo visits Pedro&#x27;s shantytown dwelling, he is horrified by the extremely poor living conditions. Their friendship mirrors that of the Lone Ranger and Native American Tonto from Gonzalo&#x27;s favorite comic book series. Gonzalo realizes that their friendship is against all odds when Silvana discovers them reading an issue of the magazine and comments on the implausibility of a white person being friends with an Indian.

As the political unrest in Chile escalates, the boys&#x27; friendship is put to the test. Pedro&#x27;s alcoholic father ridicules him, telling him that while his supposed friend will grow up to be wealthy, he will be stuck in the lower class, likely cleaning toilets for the rich. The affluent parents of the students at St. Patrick&#x27;s school have differing views on Father McEnroe&#x27;s project. While some support the new policies, including Gonzalo&#x27;s father, many others, including Gonzalo&#x27;s mother, believe that for the good of the country, social classes should not be mixed.

The school&#x27;s vegetable garden, which the students take care of, turns out to be a failure, jeopardizing the funding for Father McEnroe&#x27;s project. During an anti-Communist protest, Gonzalo&#x27;s mother takes Silvana&#x27;s merchandise when the latter is being threatened by other protesters. Silvana retaliates by spitting on Gonzalo&#x27;s mother&#x27;s car windshield and calling her a whore. This increases tension between Gonzalo and Pedro, leading to a fight and the end of their friendship.

Following the coup, Father McEnroe is removed from the school by the military and is not even allowed to perform mass at the chapel. When he attends the first mass performed by a new priest, he receives communion but does not swallow the sacramental bread to preserve it from desecration and declares the place profane. Pedro leads the other students in honoring the priest, resulting in his expulsion from the school.

Gonzalo visits the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live, but upon arrival, he witnesses soldiers raiding the area and a tragic incident unfolds, resulting in Silvana being shot and killed. Gonzalo finds himself dragged into the chaos and struggles to convince a soldier that he does not belong there until he shows them his nice clothing and fair complexion. Eventually, the soldier lets him go, warning him never to return.

Heartbroken over the events he witnessed and the loss of his friend, Gonzalo returns to his family&#x27;s new home. Their wealth has increased thanks to his mother&#x27;s lover and the new government&#x27;s redistribution of wealth. However, Gonzalo is left devastated, recalling the last time he saw Pedro staring at the ruins of their homes.

==Cast==

== Reception ==
Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; deemed the film to be &quot;that rare film that merges the personal and political without sacrificing restraint or intellectual honesty&quot;. 

Mike Goodridge of &quot;ScreenDaily&quot; described the film as a &quot;small, artfully crafted movie&quot;, otherwise deeming it to be an &quot;unsettling piece&quot; which [unlike other films with similar themes] &quot;doesn&#x27;t fall into easy traps of sentimentalism&quot;.

<text>Brad Daugherty (born July 5, 1951, in Mountain Grove, Missouri) is a professional poker player.

Daugherty began playing poker in 1969 on a high school trip. Following high school he worked in the construction industry, but after hearing of large prize money for tournament winnings, in 1978 he moved to Reno, Nevada. In 1987 he won his first tournament.

Daugherty was awarded the first ever million-dollar first-place prize at the World Series of Poker when he won the bracelet in the 1991 Main Event, and finished in ninth place in 1993. As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,700,000. His 19 cashes as the WSOP account for $1,158,574 of those winnings.

Daugherty is the co-author with Tom McEvoy of &quot;Championship Satellite Strategy&quot; and &quot;No-Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em for New Players&quot;. He is married, has three sons, and currently resides in the Philippines, where he attempted to raise money for impoverished families by putting his 1991 WSOP bracelet up for auction on eBay twice in 2010 and 2011, with it going unsold both times due to bids not meeting his reserve price.

<doc id="983585" wikidata="Q1803955" url="?curid=983585" title="The Insyderz">
<text>The Insyderz were an American Christian ska-punk band from Detroit, Michigan. They formed in 1996 and disbanded in 2005. The band reformed in 2009, but have not been actively playing shows in the last few years. The Insyderz are one of the &quot;big three&quot; bands which represented the Christian ska scene, alongside the Supertones and Five Iron Frenzy. 

== Band history ==
The Insyderz began from Joe Yerke and Nate Sjogren who led worship together at their church. Many members have associations with the Salvation Army, and throughout the life of the band support has been reciprocal, with the band playing at SA sponsored youth rallies. The band found their break at the 1996 Cornerstone Festival. They began playing on their campsite, and wound up garnering the attention of Michael Sean Black and Gene Eugene, who signed them to his label Brainstorm Artists International. While that label folded soon after, the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Motor City Ska&quot; (1997), effectively established a presence in the Christian music marketplace and garnered the attention of Steve Taylor&#x27;s Squint Entertainment.

Their subsequent release, &quot;Skalleluia&quot;, became their most successful album and ranked the highest in record sales for the band. The album consists of contemporary praise and worship songs in ska and ska-punk renditions. Guest performances include Gene Eugene, Terry Scott Taylor, and Steve Taylor. Despite the fact that their initial formation centered around turning praise and worship songs into ska the album faced criticism for &quot;jumping on the bandwagon&quot; on praise and worship music&#x27;s growing commercial appeal. Beyond charting on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hot 200&quot; and &quot;Heatseekers&quot; charts and spending six months on their &quot;Top Contemporary Christian&quot; chart, their rendition of Rich Mullins&#x27; song &quot;Awesome God&quot; won the band a Dove Award for &quot;Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year&quot; in 1999. Some commercial success for the album was due in part to the use of recently written and widely known contemporary worship songs. Covers on the album include Twila Paris&#x27;s &quot;We will Glorfiy&quot; and Keith Green&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Lord, You&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;.

&quot;Skalleluia&quot; became an unexpected hit for the band but differs from the sound the Insyderz had displayed on their own original material. &quot;Skalleluia&quot; broke the band into the national limelight, but somewhat restricted their audience to the church. For the Insyderz this was somewhat problematic; their stated goal was to attract a mainstream audience in order to, in the words of Joe Yerke, &quot;reach the unsaved.&quot; In mid-1998 trombonist Mike Rowland got married and left the band; he was replaced by Sang Kim, who appeared on their next release. Later the same year they released their third album, &quot;Fight of My Life&quot;, which contains original songs and returned the sound of their debut release.

In support of &quot;Skalleluia!&quot; the band toured with Plankeye and Morella&#x27;s Forest. In 1999 they made an appearance on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and embarked on an all-ska tour with the Skeletones and Jeffries Fan Club. On this tour the band held daily Bible studies where two members of the Skeletones converted to Christianity. Also following this tour Jeffries Fan Club guitarist Sonnie Johnston left to join Five Iron Frenzy. Late that year they were a part of the &quot;Holy Roller Tour&quot;, which was held in roller skating rinks across the nation. Other bands involved included Five Iron, The W&#x27;s, and Justin McRoberts.

In 2000 &quot;Skalleluia Too!&quot; was released. Within the next few years the band&#x27;s website featured rare updates and touring seemed to halt which led to rumors of the band&#x27;s demise. However, The Insyderz had become tired of record label politics and until business had been sorted out continued to perform on a much smaller scale. Many of the members of the band married including Nate Sjogren (drums), Bram Roberts (Trumpet), Beau McCarthy (Bass), Kyle Wasil (Guitar), and Joe Yerke (vocals). The band decided to spend more time working and ministering through other projects while never fully disbanding. Nate Sjogren, for instance, left to start a youth oriented church in Michigan with the help of the Salvation Army.

In 2001 a compilation CD entitled &quot;The Greatest &amp; The Rarest&quot; (or alternately &quot;Tails of a Comet&quot;) was released, which consists of fifteen popular songs from their first four albums and six rare songs.

In 2003 they re-activated, appearing at Cornerstone, and releasing an album entitled &quot;Soundtrack to a Revolution&quot;. After the release the Insyderz went through another lineup change adding Royce Nunley (Suicide Machines) and Dan Powers (Blueprint 76) on bass.

In the first half of 2005, the band announced on their website that they would be playing their last three shows in August and September of that year, which led to confusion on whether they were the band&#x27;s last three shows or the tour&#x27;s last three. Later, in August of the same year, the site was updated to announce that the band would be breaking up after their final show on September 24, 2005, as a part of the I&#x27;ll Fight Fest presented by The Salvation Army. The show was performed with The O.C. Supertones who were also in the midst of a final tour. In 2009, the band got back together and in 2012, they released The Sinner&#x27;s Songbook. In 2012, they did a short tour with Five Iron Frenzy, but have remained inactive in the past several years due to the band member&#x27;s work schedules and family life. 

===Post break up===
Nate Sjogren has played drums in several other projects including &quot;Dead By Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Paper Sound&quot;, and the singer/songwriter &quot;James Stephen&quot;.

In December 2007, Todd, along with wife Sarah, welcomed their first child, a girl named Harper. In January 2008 Todd Miesch received his first official teaching job teaching for Stoney Creek High School in Rochester, Michigan.

Michael Lloyd now lives in Los Angeles, and is currently working in the film industry. Nate and Beau work together at the Genesis church in Royal Oak, MI. Joe works as a police officer now.

==Reunion==
During 2011, The Insyderz launched a kickstarter campaign to fund their next album, &quot;The Sinner&#x27;s Songbook&quot;, and succeeded in raising the funds to do so. In April 2012 The Insyderz began recording at Al Sutton&#x27;s Rustbelt Studio in Royal Oak, MI with Producer/Engineer Eric Hoegemeyer, and released &quot;The Sinner&#x27;s Songbook&quot; publicly on Labor Day, September 3, 2012. The band played some sporadic local shows during this time, which sometimes featured fill-in trombone players, including Kenny Plont, formerly of A Billion Ernies. However, trombone duties were usually performed by Tim Reynolds. Matt Darcie and John Miller played guitar and bass in the band during their reunion as well.

<text>Giovanni Bernardino Nanino (ca. 1560 – 1623) was an Italian composer, teacher and singing master of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, and a leading member of the Roman School of composers. He was the younger brother of the somewhat more influential composer Giovanni Maria Nanino.

==Life==
Born in Vallerano, he was first a boy soprano in the local cathedral, just like his brother. His first post may have been as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Santa Maria dei Monti in 1588, and he is known to have acquired the post of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome in 1591, after his brother left to join the papal choir. The two brothers, however, were living together at this time in a house owned by the church, and spent a good deal of their time teaching choirboys. Following the appointment at San Luigi dei Francesi, he was associated with Cardinal Montalto, a wealthy and influential patron of art and music, and may have served as teacher, composer, and archivist for the Cardinal at his church, San Lorenzo in Damaso.

==Works==
Nanino&#x27;s music of the 1580s and 1590s is conservative in idiom, avoiding the experimental tendencies of his brother and Marenzio, preferring instead to incorporate the technique and expressive style of the earlier Roman composers such as Palestrina. After about 1610 he adopted the technique of basso continuo in his sacred works — hardly a conservative tendency — and, significantly, something his brother never did. Much of his earlier music is secular (such as madrigals), but he published several books of motets after 1610, after his brother&#x27;s death. It is tempting to speculate that when he wrote music in the same format as his brother, he chose opposite stylistic means, and after his brother&#x27;s death he quickly adopted the progressive style of the time, using it to write music in the same forms which his brother had used more conservatively.

<doc id="983596" wikidata="Q6736006" url="?curid=983596" title="Main Line (NJ Transit)">
<text>The Main Line (or Erie Main Line) is a commuter rail line owned and operated by New Jersey Transit running from Suffern, New York to Hoboken, New Jersey, in the United States. It runs daily commuter service and was once the north–south main line of the Erie Railroad. It is colored yellow on NJ Transit system maps, and its symbol is a water wheel.

The Bergen County Line splits off the Main Line just west of the Secaucus Junction transfer station and rejoins it at Ridgewood. Trains on both lines are push-pull, powered by diesel locomotives (ordinarily on the west end of the train).

==History==
The Erie Railroad&#x27;s main line ran from Jersey City to Chicago via Binghamton and Jamestown, New York, Akron and Marion, Ohio, and Huntington, Indiana, with branches to Buffalo, Cleveland, and Dayton. The section in New Jersey and lower New York State saw frequent commuter service to the waterfront Pavonia Terminal, Jersey City, with connections to the Pavonia Ferry to Lower Manhattan.

The Erie Railroad&#x27;s major long-distance passenger trains to Chicago, the &quot;Atlantic Express and Pacific Express,&quot; the &quot;Erie Limited&quot;, and the &quot;Lake Cities,&quot; ran along this section, through Passaic, Paterson, Ridgewood, on to Port Jervis, northwest to Binghamton, New York State&#x27;s Southern Tier, Jamestown, and west to Chicago. The final long-distance train along this route was the &quot;Atlantic Express and Pacific Express&quot; in 1965. 
In 1963, the Erie Main Line south of Paterson to its connection with the Bergen County Line south of Carlton Hill in Rutherford was abandoned and service began using the former Lackawanna Boonton Branch south of Paterson via the Lyndhurst Draw and Upper Hack Lift bridges as the route through downtown Passaic was abandoned. Nominal Boonton Line service began using the Erie&#x27;s Greenwood Lake division up to its junction with the Lackawanna Boonton Branch at Mountain View in Wayne as the Lackawanna right-of-way in Paterson was used for the construction of Interstate 80 and New Jersey State Highway 19. The Erie Jersey City terminal was abandoned circa 1959 after all Erie service had moved to the Lackawanna Hoboken Terminal.

Service under Erie Lackawanna introduced new GE U34CH diesels and Comet I cars in 1970 which lasted under NJ DOT and Conrail into the NJ Transit era. Metro-North took over service north of Suffern in 1983. Effective April 18, 1983, Metro-North Railroad shifted its Port Jervis Line service to run on the Graham Line freight bypass, thus ending the direct passenger route from Harriman through Monroe and Goshen to Middletown. Service was increased along with the opening of the Secaucus Junction station in late 2003.

=== 1996 Secaucus collision ===
On February 9, 1996, a Main Line train was involved in a collision with a Bergen County Line train in Secaucus.

==Service==
Departing the historic 1907-built Hoboken Terminal, the yards for the coaches to the left, trains pass over two city streets and the Hudson Bergen Light Rail before entering the Bergen Tunnels under the Bergen Hill section of Hudson Palisades. Midway through the tunnel there are air shafts allowing light through and venting out the diesel fumes. Exiting the tunnel, the train curves right onto the Main Line at West End interlocking in Jersey City. Until 1963 this was the DL&amp;W Boonton Branch; about a mile ahead was the connection built circa 1956 with the Erie main line (that after 1963 became the Bergen County Line). Two trains collided head-on here in 1996, killing two engineers and a passenger. The ramps for New Jersey Turnpike Interchange 15X now occupy the Erie alignment—since the Bergen County line was rerouted adjacent to the Main Line to pass through Secaucus Junction.

At Secaucus Junction, all trains stop for passengers to change to and from Northeast Corridor Line, North Jersey Coast Line, Raritan Valley Line and Midtown Direct trains on the Morristown Line, the Gladstone Branch, and the Montclair-Boonton Line on the upper level.

The Main Line then runs through an industrial section of Secaucus. Shortly afterwards the Bergen County Line curves right on its new connection to the Erie alignment. The Main Line then crosses over the Hackensack River on the single-track Upper Hack Lift bridge, built in 1958.

Double track resumes under the New Jersey Turnpike&#x27;s western spur after 0.4 mile of single track. The train continues through the Meadowlands and passes the first grade crossing at Valley Brook Avenue in Lyndhurst. The line curves slightly and passes through the 1903 Kingsland tunnel. Kingsland station is shortly after the tunnel in an open cut. Just beyond Kingsland station is Lyndhurst station, on an embankment.

After Lyndhurst the train crosses the Passaic River on a swing bridge that has been bolted shut (although it is technically required by Federal regulation to be opened on 24 hours notice). The train passes under Route 3 and approaches Delawanna station.

Next stop is Passaic, on an embankment. After Passaic, the Main Line has a stretch through some industrial areas before the Clifton station, also on an embankment.

The Main Line passes under U.S. Route 46 and the Garden State Parkway before it crosses under and over several streets in south Paterson. It leaves the DL&amp;W Boonton Branch alignment at about and reaches the Erie Main Line alignment at . This connection was single track when built circa 1963, then double-tracked in a rehabilitation project in 2002. The line passes under Interstate 80 and heads into downtown Paterson. The Erie station in Paterson is elevated, with a center platform.

Continuing north the Main Line is elevated through Paterson, passing over streets. After several grade crossings in an industrial area, the tracks cross the Passaic River on a truss bridge. Hawthorne is the next stop, at grade level. After a long stretch, the train reaches Glen Rock station, at grade level at a crossing.

After Glen Rock the Main Line merges with the Bergen County Line at Ridgewood Junction. The line widens to three tracks (in Erie days the line was four tracks from here to Suffern NY). Ridgewood station is next, with Spanish-style design on the station building and with newly constructed high-level platforms.

Next is Ho-Ho-Kus, also at grade. Waldwick follows with an abandoned station building on the northbound side and a footbridge connecting the two platforms. Waldwick Yard is just north of the station with the restored WC tower on the southbound side by the yard. Just following Waldwick Yard is a grade crossing. North of the grade crossing (which has three tracks) the line becomes two tracks.

Allendale and Ramsey follow, both as grade-level stations. Ramsey-Route 17 station (opened August 22, 2004) is next. It is a park-and-ride facility located off of Route 17 south in Ramsey.

Mahwah follows and is the last station in New Jersey. Crossing over the New York state line the train arrives at Suffern, the last stop for NJT Main Line trains.

<text>Redoubt Volcano, or Mount Redoubt (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Bentuggezh K’enulgheli&quot;), is an active stratovolcano in the largely volcanic Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located at the head of the Chigmit Mountains subrange in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, the mountain is just west of Cook Inlet, in the Kenai Peninsula Borough about southwest of Anchorage. At , in just over Mount Redoubt attains of prominence over its surrounding terrain. It is the highest summit in the Aleutian Range. In 1976, Redoubt Volcano was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

Active for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted four times since it was first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two questionable eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of . It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about . The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal.

==Name==
The official name of the mountain is Redoubt Volcano, a translation of the Russian name &quot;Sopka Redutskaya&quot;, referring to, as does the word &quot;redoubt&quot;, &quot;a fortified place&quot;. A local name, &quot;Ujakushatsch&quot;, also means &quot;fortified place&quot;, but it is difficult to determine if one name is derived from the other. The Board on Geographic Names decided on the name &quot;Redoubt Volcano&quot; in 1891.

The Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution refers to the mountain simply as &quot;Redoubt&quot;, and lists these alternate names: Burnt Mountain, Goreloi, Mirando, Ujakushatsch, Viesokaia, and Yjakushatsch. The Alaska Volcano Observatory also uses simply &quot;Redoubt&quot;; it lists the same alternate names in addition to: Goryalaya, Redoute Mtn., and Redutskaya, Sopka.

==Geology==

The volcano is about in diameter at its base with a rough volume of . The sides of the upper cone are relatively steep (in comparison to volcanoes in general). Made up of pyroclastic flow deposits and lava flows, and resting on Mesozoic era rocks of the Aleutian Mountain Range batholith, the mountain has been somewhat weathered by movement of several glaciers that reside on it. The current main vent is on the north side of the crater by the head of the Drift glacier. Also present on the mountain are Holocene lahar deposits that extend as far as the Cook Inlet. This mountain has produced andesite, basalt and dacite, with relatively silicic andesite dominant in recent eruptions.

==Eruptions==
===Early reports===
Captain James Cook saw Mt. Redoubt during the summer of 1778, describing it as &quot;emitting a white smoke but no fire which made some think it was no more than a white thick cloud such as we have frequently seen on the Coast, for the most part appearing on the sides of hills and often extends along a whole range and at different times falls or rises, expands or contracts itself and has a resemblance to Clouds of white smoke. But this besides being too small for one of those clouds, remained as it were fixed in the same spot for the whole time the Mountain was clear which was above 48 hours.&quot; However, several sources call this a &quot;discredited eruption&quot;. There are several other of these activities that are not called eruptions.

In 1819, smoke was observed at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by an employee of the ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.


===1881===
There was apparently an eruption described as &quot;to the eastward, Redoubt Volcano, high, is constantly smoking, with periods of exaggerated activity. Fire has been seen issuing from its summit far out at sea. A great eruption took place in 1881, when a party of native hunters half-way up its slopes were overwhelmed by a lava-flow and only two escaped.&quot; However, this eruption is not well documented by other sources.

===1902===
The volcano erupted rather abruptly in 1902, spewing out ash from January 18 to June 21 in the year. A local newspaper stated, &quot;Word has just been received that Redoubt, one of the volcanoes at Cook&#x27;s Inlet had an eruption on January 18, and the country for around was covered with ashes and lava. The news comes from Sunrise, but nothing definite has been ascertained as to whether any damage was done, for no boats have as yet been in the neighborhood of the volcano.&quot; There were many other news reports on the eruption, one describing the eruption as &quot;a terrific earthquake which burst the mountain asunder leaving a large gap,&quot; which could possibly suggest the crack formation in the volcano&#x27;s crater, however, it is unlikely. Supposedly, the volcano was ejecting &quot;flames&quot; from its crater, and the eruption terrified natives in the area. Newspapers seemed to suggest that the ash had traveled for more than , reaching the opposite side of the Cook Inlet.

===1989–1990===
The volcano erupted on December 14, 1989, and continued to erupt for over six months. Sudden melting of snow and ice at the summit caused by pyroclastic flows and dome collapses caused lahars, or mudflows, which flowed down the north flank of the mountain. A majority of the mudflows coursed to Cook Inlet, about from the volcano. The lahars entered a nearby river, worrying officials that they might destroy an oil storage facility located along it.

Since lahars were produced repeatedly, scientists realized that they could use these to analyze a trial period for a newly developed device proposed to measure the movement of rocks against each other. This device, now known as an Acoustic Flow Monitor, alerts nearby stations to possible lahars.

The eruption also caused an airliner to have all four engines fail after a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flew into a cloud of volcanic ash.
Damage from the eruption was estimated at $160 million, the second costliest volcanic eruption in United States history.

===2009===

==== Pre-eruption ====
On January 24, 2009, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit the region at a depth of 98 kilometers. The relation to the eruption is unknown, but was the strongest in the vicinity since 2001.

On January 30, 2009, scientists from the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) warned that an eruption was imminent, sending experienced Alaskans shopping for protection against a dusty shower of volcanic ash that could descend on south-central Alaska.

By January 31, volcanic earthquakes increased to several per hour, and a large hole in the glacier on the side of the mountain was spotted. Scientists began to monitor seismic data from the mountain twenty-four hours a day in an effort to warn people in nearby communities. A fly over conducted by the AVO detected &quot;significant steaming from a new melt depression at the mouth of the summit crater near the vent area of the 1989-90 eruption.&quot;

==== March 15====
Seismic activity at Redoubt increased beginning about 13:01 ATZ. An AVO observation flight reported that a steam and ash plume rose as high as above sea level and produced minor ash fall on the upper south flank of Redoubt. Later reports were that the plume was then mainly steam.

On the basis of this change in activity, AVO increased the level of concern and alert level to ORANGE/WATCH.

==== Emissions ====
The material ejected from the volcano mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Further study by airborne monitors suggests that the materials were not oxidized much, and little of the concentration contained sulfates, less than 20%.

====Large scale eruptions begin====

Mount Redoubt erupted explosively late in the evening of March 22, 2009. AVO recorded numerous volcanic eruptions and/or explosions at Redoubt volcano during this period of activity. Ash from this eruption fell in Alaska&#x27;s largest city, Anchorage.

<doc id="983601" wikidata="Q656638" url="?curid=983601" title="Comparative genomic hybridization">
<text>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method for analysing copy number variations (CNVs) relative to ploidy level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells. The aim of this technique is to quickly and efficiently compare two genomic DNA samples arising from two sources, which are most often closely related, because it is suspected that they contain differences in terms of either gains or losses of either whole chromosomes or subchromosomal regions (a portion of a whole chromosome). This technique was originally developed for the evaluation of the differences between the chromosomal complements of solid tumor and normal tissue, and has an improved resolution of 5–10 megabases compared to the more traditional cytogenetic analysis techniques of giemsa banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which are limited by the resolution of the microscope utilized.

This is achieved through the use of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization. In short, this involves the isolation of DNA from the two sources to be compared, most commonly a test and reference source, independent labelling of each DNA sample with fluorophores (fluorescent molecules) of different colours (usually red and green), denaturation of the DNA so that it is single stranded, and the hybridization of the two resultant samples in a 1:1 ratio to a normal metaphase spread of chromosomes, to which the labelled DNA samples will bind at their locus of origin. Using a fluorescence microscope and computer software, the differentially coloured fluorescent signals are then compared along the length of each chromosome for identification of chromosomal differences between the two sources. A higher intensity of the test sample colour in a specific region of a chromosome indicates the gain of material of that region in the corresponding source sample, while a higher intensity of the reference sample colour indicates the loss of material in the test sample in that specific region. A neutral colour (yellow when the fluorophore labels are red and green) indicates no difference between the two samples in that location.

CGH is only able to detect unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities. This is because balanced chromosomal abnormalities such as reciprocal translocations, inversions or ring chromosomes do not affect copy number, which is what is detected by CGH technologies. CGH does, however, allow for the exploration of all 46 human chromosomes in single test and the discovery of deletions and duplications, even on the microscopic scale which may lead to the identification of candidate genes to be further explored by other cytological techniques.

Through the use of DNA microarrays in conjunction with CGH techniques, the more specific form of array CGH (aCGH) has been developed, allowing for a locus-by-locus measure of CNV with increased resolution as low as 100 kilobases. This improved technique allows for the aetiology of known and unknown conditions to be discovered.

==History==
The motivation underlying the development of CGH stemmed from the fact that the available forms of cytogenetic analysis at the time (giemsa banding and FISH) were limited in their potential resolution by the microscopes necessary for interpretation of the results they provided. Furthermore, giemsa banding interpretation has the potential to be ambiguous and therefore has lowered reliability, and both techniques require high labour inputs which limits the loci which may be examined.

The first report of CGH analysis was by Kallioniemi and colleagues in 1992 at the University of California, San Francisco, who utilised CGH in the analysis of solid tumors. They achieved this by the direct application of the technique to both breast cancer cell lines and primary bladder tumors in order to establish complete copy number karyotypes for the cells. They were able to identify 16 different regions of amplification, many of which were novel discoveries.

Soon after in 1993, du Manoir et al. reported virtually the same methodology. The authors painted a series of individual human chromosomes from a DNA library with two different fluorophores in different proportions to test the technique, and also applied CGH to genomic DNA from patients affected with either Downs syndrome or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia as well as cells of a renal papillary carcinoma cell line. It was concluded that the fluorescence ratios obtained were accurate and that differences between genomic DNA from different cell types were detectable, and therefore that CGH was a highly useful cytogenetic analysis tool.

Initially, the widespread use of CGH technology was difficult, as protocols were not uniform and therefore inconsistencies arose, especially due to uncertainties in the interpretation of data. However, in 1994 a review was published which described an easily understood protocol in detail and the image analysis software was made available commercially, which allowed CGH to be utilised all around the world.
As new techniques such as microdissection and degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) became available for the generation of DNA products, it was possible to apply the concept of CGH to smaller chromosomal abnormalities, and thus the resolution of CGH was improved.

The implementation of array CGH, whereby DNA microarrays are used instead of the traditional metaphase chromosome preparation, was pioneered by Solinas-Tolodo et al. in 1997 using tumor cells and Pinkel et al. in 1998 by use of breast cancer cells. This was made possible by the Human Genome Project which generated a library of cloned DNA fragments with known locations throughout the human genome, with these fragments being used as probes on the DNA microarray. Now probes of various origins such as cDNA, genomic PCR products and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) can be used on DNA microarrays which may contain up to 2 million probes. Array CGH is automated, allows greater resolution (down to 100 kb) than traditional CGH as the probes are far smaller than metaphase preparations, requires smaller amounts of DNA, can be targeted to specific chromosomal regions if required and is ordered and therefore faster to analyse, making it far more adaptable to diagnostic uses.

==Basic methods==

===Metaphase slide preparation===
The DNA on the slide is a reference sample, and is thus obtained from a karyotypically normal man or woman, though it is preferential to use female DNA as they possess two X chromosomes which contain far more genetic information than the male Y chromosome. Phytohaemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes are used. 1mL of heparinised blood is added to 10ml of culture medium and incubated for 72 hours at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Colchicine is added to arrest the cells in mitosis, the cells are then harvested and treated with hypotonic potassium chloride and fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid.

One drop of the cell suspension should then be dropped onto an ethanol cleaned slide from a distance of about 30 cm, optimally this should be carried out at room temperature at humidity levels of 60–70%. Slides should be evaluated by visualisation using a phase contrast microscope, minimal cytoplasm should be observed and chromosomes should not be overlapping and be 400–550 bands long with no separated chromatids and finally should appear dark rather than shiny. Slides then need to be air dried overnight at room temperature, and any further storage should be in groups of four at −20 °C with either silica beads or nitrogen present to maintain dryness. Different donors should be tested as hybridization may be variable. Commercially available slides may be used, but should always be tested first.

===Isolation of DNA from test tissue and reference tissue===

Standard phenol extraction is used to obtain DNA from test or reference (karyotypically normal individual) tissue, which involves the combination of Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and phenol with aqueous DNA in equal amounts. This is followed by separation by agitation and centrifugation, after which the aqueous layer is removed and further treated using ether and finally ethanol precipitation is used to concentrate the DNA.

May be completed using DNA isolation kits available commercially which are based on affinity columns.

Preferentially, DNA should be extracted from fresh or frozen tissue as this will be of the highest quality, though it is now possible to use archival material which is formalin fixed or paraffin wax embedded, provided the appropriate procedures are followed. 0.5-1 μg of DNA is sufficient for the CGH experiment, though if the desired amount is not obtained DOP-PCR may be applied to amplify the DNA, however it in this case it is important to apply DOP-PCR to both the test and reference DNA samples to improve reliability.

===DNA labelling===

Nick translation is used to label the DNA and involves cutting DNA and substituting nucleotides labelled with fluorophores (direct labelling) or biotin or oxigenin to have fluophore conjugated antibodies added later (indirect labelling). It is then important to check fragment lengths of both test and reference DNA by gel electrophoresis, as they should be within the range of 500kb-1500kb for optimum hybridization.

===Blocking===
Unlabelled Life Technologies Corporation&#x27;s Cot-1 DNA (placental DNA enriched with repetitive sequences of length 50bp-100bp)is added to block normal repetitive DNA sequences, particularly at centromeres and telomeres, as these sequences, if detected, may reduce the fluorescence ratio and cause gains or losses to escape detection.

===Hybridization===
8–12μl of each of labelled test and labelled reference DNA are mixed and 40 μg Cot-1 DNA is added, then precipitated and subsequently dissolved in 6μl of hybridization mix, which contains 50% formamide to decrease DNA melting temperature and 10% dextran sulphate to increase the effective probe concentration in a saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution at a pH of 7.0.

Denaturation of the slide and probes are carried out separately. The slide is submerged in 70% formamide/2xSSC for 5–10 minutes at 72 °C, while the probes are denatured by immersion in a water bath of 80 °C for 10 minutes and are immediately added to the metaphase slide preparation. This reaction is then covered with a coverslip and left for two to four days in a humid chamber at 40 °C.

The coverslip is then removed and 5 minute washes are applied, three using 2xSSC at room temperature, one at 45 °C with 0.1xSSC and one using TNT at room temperature. The reaction is then preincubated for 10 minutes then followed by a 60-minute, 37 °C incubation, three more 5 minute washes with TNT then one with 2xSSC at room temperature. The slide is then dried using an ethanol series of 70%/96%/100% before counterstaining with DAPI (0.35 μg/ml), for chromosome identification, and sealing with a coverslip.

===Fluorescence visualisation and imaging===
A fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filters for the DAPI stain as well as the two fluorophores utilised is required for visualisation, and these filters should also minimise the crosstalk between the fluorophores, such as narrow band pass filters. The microscope must provide uniform illumination without chromatic variation, be appropriately aligned and have a &quot;plan&quot; type of objective which is apochromatic and give a magnification of x63 or x100.

The image should be recorded using a camera with spatial resolution at least 0.1 μm at the specimen level and give an image of at least 600x600 pixels. The camera must also be able to integrate the image for at least 5 to 10 seconds, with a minimum photometric resolution of 8 bit.

Dedicated CGH software is commercially available for the image processing step, and is required to subtract background noise, remove and segment materials not of chromosomal origin, normalize the fluorescence ratio, carry out interactive karyotyping and chromosome scaling to standard length. A &quot;relative copy number karyotype&quot; which presents chromosomal areas of deletions or amplifications is generated by averaging the ratios of a number of high quality metaphases and plotting them along an ideogram, a diagram identifying chromosomes based on banding patterns. Interpretation of the ratio profiles is conducted either using fixed or statistical thresholds (confidence intervals). When using confidence intervals, gains or losses are identified when 95% of the fluorescence ratio does not contain 1.0.

=== Extra notes ===
Extreme care must be taken to avoid contamination of any step involving DNA, especially with the test DNA as contamination of the sample with normal DNA will skew results closer to 1.0, thus abnormalities may go undetected. FISH, PCR and flow cytometry experiments may be employed to confirm results.

==Array comparative genomic hybridization==

Array comparative genomic hybridization (also microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, matrix CGH, array CGH, aCGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique for the detection of chromosomal copy number changes on a genome wide and high-resolution scale. Array CGH compares the patient&#x27;s genome against a reference genome and identifies differences between the two genomes, and hence locates regions of genomic imbalances in the patient, utilizing the same principles of competitive fluorescence in situ hybridization as traditional CGH.

With the introduction of array CGH, the main limitation of conventional CGH, a low resolution, is overcome. In array CGH, the metaphase chromosomes are replaced by cloned DNA fragments (+100–200 kb) of which the exact chromosomal location is known. This allows the detection of aberrations in more detail and, moreover, makes it possible to map the changes directly onto the genomic sequence.

Array CGH has proven to be a specific, sensitive, fast and high-throughput technique, with considerable advantages compared to other methods used for the analysis of DNA copy number changes making it more amenable to diagnostic applications. Using this method, copy number changes at a level of 5–10 kilobases of DNA sequences can be detected. , even high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations (SV) at resolution of 200 bp. This method allows one to identify new recurrent chromosome changes such as microdeletions and duplications in human conditions such as cancer and birth defects due to chromosome aberrations.

===Methodology===

Array CGH is based on the same principle as conventional CGH. In both techniques, DNA from a reference (or control) sample and DNA from a test (or patient) sample are differentially labelled with two different fluorophores and used as probes that are cohybridized competitively onto nucleic acid targets. In conventional CGH, the target is a reference metaphase spread. In array CGH, these targets can be genomic fragments cloned in a variety of vectors (such as BACs or plasmids), cDNAs, or oligonucleotides.

Figure 2. is a schematic overview of the array CGH technique. DNA from the sample to be tested is labeled with a red fluorophore (Cyanine 5) and a reference DNA sample is labeled with green fluorophore (Cyanine 3). Equal quantities of the two DNA samples are mixed and cohybridized to a DNA microarray of several thousand evenly spaced cloned DNA fragments or oligonucleotides, which have been spotted in triplicate on the array. After hybridization, digital imaging systems are used to capture and quantify the relative fluorescence intensities of each of the hybridized fluorophores. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities is proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. If the intensities of the flurochromes are equal on one probe, this region of the patient&#x27;s genome is interpreted as having equal quantity of DNA in the test and reference samples; if there is an altered Cy3:Cy5 ratio this indicates a loss or a gain of the patient DNA at that specific genomic region.

===Technological approaches to array CGH===
Array CGH has been implemented using a wide variety of techniques. Therefore, some of the advantages and limitations of array CGH are dependent on the technique chosen.
The initial approaches used arrays produced from large insert genomic DNA clones, such as BACs. The use of BACs provides sufficient intense signals to detect single-copy changes and to locate aberration boundaries accurately. However, initial DNA yields of isolated BAC clones are low and DNA amplification techniques are necessary. These techniques include ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), degenerate primer PCR using one or several sets of primers, and rolling circle amplification. Arrays can also be constructed using cDNA. These arrays currently yield a high spatial resolution, but the number of cDNAs is limited by the genes that are encoded on the chromosomes, and their sensitivity is low due to cross-hybridization. This results in the inability to detect single copy changes on a genome wide scale. The latest approach is spotting the arrays with short oligonucleotides. The amount of oligos is almost infinite, and the processing is rapid, cost-effective, and easy. Although oligonucleotides do not have the sensitivity to detect single copy changes, averaging of ratios from oligos that map next to each other on the chromosome can compensate for the reduced sensitivity. It is also possible to use arrays which have overlapping probes so that specific breakpoints may be uncovered.

===Design approaches===

There are two approaches to the design of microarrays for CGH applications: whole genome and targeted.

Whole genome arrays are designed to cover the entire human genome. They often include clones that provide an extensive coverage across the genome; and arrays that have contiguous coverage, within the limits of the genome. Whole-genome arrays have been constructed mostly for research applications and have proven their outstanding worth in gene discovery. They are also very valuable in screening the genome for DNA gains and losses at an unprecedented resolution.

Targeted arrays are designed for a specific region(s) of the genome for the purpose of evaluating that targeted segment. It may be designed to study a specific chromosome or chromosomal segment or to identify and evaluate specific DNA dosage abnormalities in individuals with suspected microdeletion syndromes or subtelomeric rearrangements. The crucial goal of a targeted microarray in medical practice is to provide clinically useful results for diagnosis, genetic counseling, prognosis, and clinical management of unbalanced cytogenetic abnormalities.

==Applications==

===Conventional===

Conventional CGH has been used mainly for the identification of chromosomal regions that are recurrently lost or gained in tumors, as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. This approach can also be used to study chromosomal aberrations in fetal and neonatal genomes. Furthermore, conventional CGH can be used in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and have been shown to be efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities associated with human genetic disorders.

====In cancer research====
CGH data from several studies of the same tumor type show consistent patterns of non-random genetic aberrations. Some of these changes appear to be common to various kinds of malignant tumors, while others are more tumor specific. For example, gains of chromosomal regions lq, 3q and 8q, as well as losses of 8p, 13q, 16q and 17p, are common to a number of tumor types, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, renal and bladder cancer (Figure. 3). Other alterations, such as 12p and Xp gains in testicular cancer, 13q gain 9q loss in bladder cancer, 14q loss in renal cancer and Xp loss in ovarian cancer are more specific, and might reflect the unique selection forces operating during cancer development in different organs. Array CGH is also frequently used in research and diagnostics of B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

====Chromosomal aberrations====
Cri du Chat (CdC) is a syndrome caused by a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. Several studies have shown that conventional CGH is suitable to detect the deletion, as well as more complex chromosomal alterations. For example, Levy et al. (2002) reported an infant with a cat-like cry, the hallmark of CdC, but having an indistinct karyotype. CGH analysis revealed a loss of chromosomal material from 5p15.3 confirming the diagnosis clinically. These results demonstrate that conventional CGH is a reliable technique in detecting structural aberrations and, in specific cases, may be more efficient in diagnosing complex abnormalities.

===Array CGH===
Array CGH applications are mainly directed at detecting genomic abnormalities in cancer. However, array CGH is also suitable for the analysis of DNA copy number aberrations that cause human genetic disorders. That is, array CGH is employed to uncover deletions, amplifications, breakpoints and ploidy abnormalities. Earlier diagnosis is of benefit to the patient as they may undergo appropriate treatments and counseling to improve their prognosis.

====Genomic abnormalities in cancer====
Genetic alterations and rearrangements occur frequently in cancer and contribute to its pathogenesis. Detecting these aberrations by array CGH provides information on the locations of important cancer genes and can have clinical use in diagnosis, cancer classification and prognostification. However, not all of the losses of genetic material are pathogenetic, since some DNA material is physiologically lost during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin subgenes. In a recent study, array CGH has been implemented to identify regions of chromosomal aberration (copy-number variation) in several mouse models of breast cancer, leading to identification of cooperating genes during myc-induced oncogenesis.

Array CGH may also be applied not only to the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities in cancer, but also to the monitoring of the progression of tumors. Differentiation between metastatic and mild lesions is also possible using FISH once the abnormalities have been identified by array CGH.

====Submicroscopic aberrations====
Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a paternal structural abnormality involving 15q11-13, while a maternal aberration in the same region causes Angelman syndrome (AS). In both syndromes, the majority of cases (75%) are the result of a 3–5 Mb deletion of the PWS/AS critical region. These small aberrations cannot be detected using cytogenetics or conventional CGH, but can be readily detected using array CGH. As a proof of principle Vissers et al. (2003) constructed a genome wide array with a 1 Mb resolution to screen three patients with known, FISH-confirmed microdeletion syndromes, including one with PWS. In all three cases, the abnormalities, ranging from 1.5 to 2.9Mb, were readily identified. Thus, array CGH was demonstrated to be a specific and sensitive approach in detecting submicroscopic aberrations.

When using overlapping microarrays, it is also possible to uncover breakpoints involved in chromosomal aberrations.

====Prenatal genetic diagnosis====
Though not yet a widely employed technique, the use of array CGH as a tool for preimplantation genetic screening is becoming an increasingly popular concept. It has the potential to detect CNVs and aneuploidy in eggs, sperm or embryos which may contribute to failure of the embryo to successfully implant, miscarriage or conditions such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21). This makes array CGH a promising tool to reduce the incidence of life altering conditions and improve success rates of IVF attempts. The technique involves whole genome amplification from a single cell which is then used in the array CGH method. It may also be used in couples carrying chromosomal translocations such as balanced reciprocal translocations or Robertsonian translocations, which have the potential to cause chromosomal imbalances in their offspring.

==Limitations of CGH and array CGH==
A main disadvantage of conventional CGH is its inability to detect structural chromosomal aberrations without copy number changes, such as mosaicism, balanced chromosomal translocations, and inversions. CGH can also only detect gains and losses relative to the ploidy level. In addition, chromosomal regions with short repetitive DNA sequences are highly variable between individuals and can interfere with CGH analysis. Therefore, repetitive DNA regions like centromeres and telomeres need to be blocked with unlabeled repetitive DNA (e.g. Cot1 DNA) and/or can be omitted from screening. Furthermore, the resolution of conventional CGH is a major practical problem that limits its clinical applications. Although CGH has proven to be a useful and reliable technique in the research and diagnostics of both cancer and human genetic disorders, the applications involve only gross abnormalities. Because of the limited resolution of metaphase chromosomes, aberrations smaller than 5–10 Mb cannot be detected using conventional CGH.
For the detection of such abnormalities, a high-resolution technique is required.
Array CGH overcomes many of these limitations. Array CGH is characterized by a high resolution, its major advantage with respect to conventional CGH. The standard resolution varies between 1 and 5 Mb, but can be increased up to approximately 40 kb by supplementing the array with extra clones. However, as in conventional CGH, the main disadvantage of array CGH is its inability to detect aberrations that do not result in copy number changes and is limited in its ability to detect mosaicism. The level of mosaicism that can be detected is dependent on the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the clones. At present, rearrangements present in approximately 50% of the cells is the detection limit. For the detection of such abnormalities, other techniques, such as SKY (Spectral karyotyping) or FISH have to still be used.

<text>Janet Rosenberg Jagan (née Rosenberg; 20 October 1920 – 28 March 2009) was an American-born Guyanese politician who served as the President of Guyana, serving from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999. She was the first female president of Guyana. She previously served as the first female Prime Minister of Guyana from March 17, 1997, to December 19, 1997. The wife of Cheddi Jagan, whom she succeeded as president, she was awarded Guyana&#x27;s highest national award, the Order of Excellence, in 1993, and the UNESCO Mahatma Gandhi Gold Medal for Women&#x27;s Rights in 1998.

==Early years and marriage==
Jagan was born Janet Rosenberg on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, on October 20, 1920. Her parents, Kathryn (née Kronberg) (1895–1990) and Charles Rosenberg (1891–1957), were Jewish. She had one brother, Maurice Rosenberg (1917-2006). Her maternal grandparents, Adolph and Rosa Kronberg (née Appelbaum), were Jewish immigrants. Adolph immigrated to Chicago from Romania and Rosa came from Hungary. The Rosenberg family lived in a bungalow at 7532 S. East End Avenue in the middle-class, formerly all-white neighborhood of South Shore. In December 1942, aged 22, while working as a student nurse at Cook County Hospital, she met Cheddi Jagan, a Hindu Indo-Guyanese dentistry student at Northwestern University. They married on August 5, 1943, and in December that year she moved with him to Guyana, where he set up his dental practice.

== In Guyana ==
In Guyana, she took part in labour activism along with her husband and joined the British Guianese Labour Union. She also worked in her husband&#x27;s dental clinic as a nurse for 10 years. In 1946, she founded the Women&#x27;s Political and Economic Organization and co-founded the Political Affairs Committee.

==Political career==
Janet Jagan unsuccessfully ran for a seat from Central Georgetown in the 1947 general election. On January 1, 1950, she and her husband were co-founders of the left-wing People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP); Janet served as the PPP&#x27;s General Secretary from 1950 to 1970. Also in 1950, Jagan was elected to the Georgetown City Council. She was subsequently elected to the House of Assembly in the April 1953 election, winning a seat from Essequibo constituency. She was one of three women to win seats in that election; following the election, she was chosen as Deputy Speaker of the Legislature.

The PPP, a left-wing party, opposed British colonial rule of Guyana. After its electoral victory in April 1953, the PPP briefly formed the government, but the British government had the PPP government removed later in the year due to concerns about the Jagans&#x27; alleged communist sympathies. Leading the country for only 133 days in 1953 following the free and universal election, she and Cheddi were first deposed and then jailed in 1955 on orders of Winston Churchill who feared the existence of a communist state in the Western Hemisphere. Churchill wished to prevent the potential for the Soviet Union to form ties with the new government, though this never occurred. Cheddi and Janet remained in jail for five months; they were subsequently kept under house arrest for two years. Churchill had modified the Guyanese constitution to prevent her and Cheddi from holding the office of President or Prime Minister. In 1957, she was re-elected to the House of Assembly from Essequibo constituency and became Minister of Labour, Health and Housing. Retaining his popularity, in 1961, Cheddi was re-elected Prime Minister. Janet later succeeded Claude Christian as Minister of Home Affairs upon Christian&#x27;s death in 1963, but resigned from the Cabinet in 1964. As a member of the Elections Commission for the opposition in 1967, she expressed concern about the possibility of vote rigging. She was also the editor of the PPP newspaper &quot;Mirror&quot; from 1973 to 1997.

Jagan was elected to Parliament in 1973 and was re-elected in 1980, 1985, and 1992, eventually becoming the longest-serving member of Parliament (46 years). Cheddi Jagan was elected as President of Guyana in 1992, and Janet Jagan became First Lady. She represented Guyana at the United Nations for three months in 1993, temporarily replacing Rudy Insanally when the latter was President of the United Nations General Assembly.

After Cheddi Jagan&#x27;s death, Janet Jagan was sworn in as Prime Minister as well as First Vice President on March 17, 1997. Jagan was the presidential candidate of the PPP in the December 1997 election. The PPP won the election, making Jagan the first female President of Guyana, as well as the country&#x27;s first Jewish and first U.S.-born leader. She was also the fourth woman elected in her own right as chief executive of a country in the Western Hemisphere, after Vigdís Finnbogadóttir of Iceland, Eugenia Charles of Dominica and Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua. She was named a Freedom hero by The My Hero Project.

==Resignation and death==
On July 1, 1999, after Jagan returned from the European-Latin American summit in Rio de Janeiro, she was admitted to St. Joseph&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in the capital, Georgetown, due to chest pains and exhaustion. She was treated for a heart condition and released from the hospital on July 3. Later in the month, she underwent tests regarding her heart condition at the Akron City Hospital in Akron, Ohio; she was discharged on July 23. Returning to Guyana, she received heart medication and was told that bypass surgery was not necessary.

Jagan resigned as President on August 8, 1999 because her health left her incapable of &quot;vigorous, strong leadership&quot;; she said that Finance Minister Bharrat Jagdeo would be her successor. Jagdeo was sworn in as President on August 11.

Despite her resignation, Jagan remained active in the PPP. At the PPP&#x27;s 29th Congress, Jagan had received the second highest number of votes (671) in the election to the party&#x27;s Central Committee, held on August 2, 2008. She was then elected to the PPP Executive Committee, in addition to being elected as editor of the PPP paper &quot;Thunder&quot;, on August 12, 2008.

Jagan later left Guyana for Maracaibo, Venezuela for treatment. She later went to Belém, Brazil for additional treatment. Janet Jagan died of an abdominal aneurysm on March 28, 2009, in Georgetown. Her body was cremated on March 31, 2009 in Guyana.

==Writings==
Janet Jagan was long involved with the literary and cultural life of Guyana. She published early poems by Martin Carter in &quot;Thunder&quot; (which she edited) and supported the publication of early Carter collections such as &quot;The Hill of Fire Glows Red&quot;. She strongly believed that Guyanese children needed books which reflected their own realities. In 1993, Peepal Tree Press published her &quot;When Grandpa Cheddi was a Boy and Other Stories&quot;, followed by &quot;Patricia, the Baby Manatee&quot; (1995), &quot;Anastasia the Ant-Eater&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Dog Who Loved Flowers&quot;.

<doc id="983611" wikidata="Q1141223" url="?curid=983611" title="Isogo-ku, Yokohama">
<text>is one of the 18 wards of the city of Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of 2010, the ward has an estimated population of 163,406 and a population density of 8,520 persons per km2. The total area is 19.17 km2.

==Geography==
Isogo is located in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and in the southeast corner of the city of Yokohama. The area is largely flatland, with scattered small hills. The Ward is bordered to the east by Negishi Bay, a minor bay on the coast of larger Tokyo Bay.

==History==
During the Edo period, area around present-day Isogo Ward was formerly part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; territory in Sagami Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. The area consisted of small fishing villages, noted primarily for their catch of Sea cucumber. After the Meiji Restoration, the area became part of Kuraki District in the new Kanagawa Prefecture. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the area was divided into numerous villages. On April 1, 1901, Negishi village was annexed by neighboring Yokohama. The remaining northern portions of the district were annexed in 1911 and 1927. On October 10, 1927, the 14 former towns and villages were re-organized as Isogo Ward within the city of Yokohama.

Isogo Ward annexed the remaining southern portions of Kuraki District (Kanazawa Town and Mutsuuraso Village) in October 1936. During World War II, Isogo was bombed twice: once on April 15, 1945, and again during the devastating Yokohama Air Raid of May 29, 1945, during which 692 houses were burned down. On May 15, 1948, Kanazawa Ward was separated from Isogo Ward. During the 1960s, the coastal areas of Isogo were converted into a massive chemical and petrochemical industrial zone through the extensive use of landfill, and the population of the area increased dramatically. The Isogo Ward offices relocated to their present location in June 1967.

==Economy==
Isogo is largely a regional commercial center and bedroom community for central Yokohama, Kawasaki and Tokyo. The coastal area is part of the Keihin heavy industrial zone, and has numerous chemical and petrochemical plants.

<text>The &quot;Worm&quot; is a market research analysis tool developed by the Roy Morgan statistics company (known then as Roy Morgan Research, who called it &quot;The Reactor&quot;), with the purpose of gauging an audience&#x27;s reaction to some visual stimuli over some time period. The name &quot;worm&quot; describes its visual appearance – as a line graph snaking up or down, usually depicted on TV during live political debates.

==Background==

Each member of the audience firstly fills out a questionnaire, used to describe the composition of the audience. Then, each member is given a control device (such as a dial or keypad) with which they select their feelings towards the vision or stimuli (for example, whether they regard the comments currently being made by a speaker favourably or unfavourably). This dial is checked centrally three times per second, and as the audience reacts differently over time, the collective feelings of the audience are gathered.
==Australian Federal Elections==

The &quot;worm&quot; has been used in the televised political debates in Australian federal elections, including those between then Australian prime minister John Howard and then-leader of the opposition Kevin Rudd in 2007 and between prime minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott in 2010.

==Internationally==

In the first UK general election debate on 15 April 2010 between Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Conservative leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, &quot;the worm&quot; was used in certain segments. A study published in March 2011 suggests that the worm may influence voters.

In New Zealand, the worm has been controversially credited with increasing the support for United Future leader Peter Dunne in the 2002 election.

<text>Amanda Louise Marchant and Samantha Joanne Marchant (born 28 June 1988), better known as Samanda, are a female duo, consisting of identical twin sisters who first came to fame on &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2007, in which they jointly achieved second place.

They released their cover of Aqua&#x27;s hit song &quot;Barbie Girl&quot; on 8 October 2007 and it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 26.

Their second single titled &quot;Honey Love&quot; entered the chart on 22 August 2008 at number 125. This song was a cover of Donny Osmond&#x27;s Number One UK Hit &quot;Puppy Love&quot; and was a tie-in with Sugar Puffs cereal (as their mascot is the Honey Monster, who also appeared in the video). 

As of 2019 they are both married and have one child each (both a few months apart and girls).

==&quot;Big Brother&quot;==
Amanda and Sam finished runners up in the eighth series of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in the UK despite being bookmakers favourite to win the show in the run up to the final. During their time on the show they received the nickname &quot;Samanda&quot; by the press.

Before their fame they were social-care students at Manchester Metropolitan University. While they were still students at university, the girls took part in an advertising campaign for a new travelcard that offered half-price travel to students. To help publicise the cards, the girls took part in a photoshoot at Manchester Piccadilly railway station with a local magician who performed a double version of Sawing a woman in half, in which he sawed both girls in half and apparently switched their lower halves before reassembling them.

Samanda had previously held the longest duration as housemates spent in the house in Big Brother UK history, after being in the house for a total of 94 days. The current record belongs to Nikki Grahame after spending a total of 157 days in the big brother house. They are also the only housemates ever to reach the final of the series without receiving a nomination.

==Career==
Amanda and Sam have their own skincare and fragrance range. Samanda by Young and Pure is aimed at girls aged 10–22 and was released on 5 November 2007. In January 2008 they signed a two-year contract with Young and Pure line of natural skin care products for teens worth between £40,000 and £150,000.

In 2008, the girls released a keep fit DVD entitled, &quot;Samanda - The Twins: Dance Workout&quot;. They were also signed by Hello Kitty as the faces of their social networking website as well as online bloggers for the site.

On GMTV with an interview with Ben Shepherd Sam and Amanda stated that they made over £1,000,000 between them. They have released two music singles since leaving Big Brother: a cover of Aqua&#x27;s &quot;Barbie Girl&quot;, and &quot;Honey Love&quot; which is a cover of Puppy Love by Donny Osmond with slightly different lyrics featuring the Honey Monster from the Sugar Puffs adverts.

A further unreleased song &quot;Whistle for a hottie&quot; has been leaked on YouTube. The duo were celebrity guest judges at the Miss and Miss Teen Galaxy UK pageant, at the Thistle hotel in Manchester on 29 March 2009. They hosted a Q&amp;A session with their fans on 27 April 2009, and a proportion of revenues generated was donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust.

<doc id="983636" wikidata="Q1373745" url="?curid=983636" title="Hoot (novel)">
<text>Hoot is a 2002 children&#x27;s mystery/suspense novel by Carl Hiaasen. The story takes place in Florida, where new arrival Roy makes two oddball friends and a bad enemy. Roy joins an effort to stop construction of a pancake house which would destroy a colony of burrowing owls who live on the site. The book won a Newbery Honor award in 2003.

==Plot==
The main character, Roy Eberhardt, moves from Montana to Florida and into the fictional town of Coconut Cove, where a 7th grader, Dana Matherson, starts to bully him and call him, &quot;Cowgirl&quot;. On the bus to school, Roy sees a boy running barefoot outside. Roy tries to leave the bus, but Dana viciously chokes and strangles him. He escapes after punching Dana in the face, breaking his nose, and then exiting the bus. However, Roy can&#x27;t catch the running boy because a golf ball hits Roy in the head. Vice-Principal Viola Hennepin suspends Roy from the bus for two weeks and orders him to write an apology to Dana. Roy calls for a truce, but Dana declines this.

A restaurant called Mother Paula&#x27;s All-American Pancake House decides to build a franchise in Coconut Cove, but vandalism delays the work. Roy learns the running boy is the vandal known as &quot;Mullet Fingers&quot; and they become friends. Mullet Fingers vandalizes and delays construction overseen by Chuck Muckle to save the endangered burrowing owls on the site.

The construction foreman, Leroy &quot;Curly&quot; Branitt, denies the owls&#x27; existence. Roy helps Mullet Fingers prove otherwise and tells his class including Beatrice Leep about the owls, and how construction will kill the endangered species, and encourages them to join him in protests.

Roy and his classmates attend the groundbreaking and expose the truth. This includes the company&#x27;s illegal removal of an environmental impact statement from their files. This revelation saves the owls and their habitat. Mother Paula&#x27;s All-American Pancake House blames former employees and promises to preserve the property as an owl sanctuary. Muckle is sent to anger management for attacking a reporter. Dana is later arrested and sentenced to a detention camp as punishment for being mean to Roy. Mullet Fingers&#x27;s mother sees him protesting with Roy and his classmates and goes in front of all the cameras and attempts to hog all the attention.

Two days later, Mullet Fingers climbs out his home&#x27;s bathroom window and is mistaken for a burglar. Mullet Fingers&#x27;s mother lies to the police and says he stole a very valuable toe ring. They believe her and he&#x27;s sent to a juvenile detention center where he escapes. In the last chapter, Roy discovers that Mullet Fingers&#x27;s real name is Napoleon Bridger Leep.

==Characters==
* Roy Andrew Eberhardt – The new kid at Trace Middle School and the main protagonist, who quickly makes an enemy of the school bully, Dana Matherson, and makes two unusual friends, Beatrice Leep and her truant step-brother &quot;Mullet Fingers&quot;.
* Beatrice Leep – &quot;A tall girl with curly blond hair and red-framed glasses.&quot; She is described as sinewy, tomboyish and aggressive, and is a member of the soccer team. At Trace Middle School, she&#x27;s known as &quot;Beatrice The Bear.&quot;
* &quot;Mullet Fingers&quot;/Napoleon Bridger – Beatrice&#x27;s stepbrother, initially known to Roy as the mysterious barefoot kid. His name is not given until the final chapter; the nickname &quot;Mullet Fingers&quot; refers to his ability to catch a mullet with his bare hands. He has a bad relationship with his mother, who had sent him to military school. Napoleon usually runs away from his family to live on his own.
* Officer David Delinko – A police officer in the Coconut Cove Police Department who is investigating the vandalism at the Mother Paula&#x27;s All-American Pancake House construction site. Dutiful and ambitious, he develops sympathy for the owls and aids the kids.
* Leroy &quot;Curly&quot; Branitt – The construction foreman on the Mother Paula&#x27;s Pancake House construction site, where all of the mysterious vandalism happens. Officer Delinko notes the irony of his nickname, as he is &quot;bald as a beach ball&quot;. He is also &quot;cranky,&quot; &quot;unsmiling,&quot; and suspicious of everyone.
* Dana Matherson – A boy who torments underclassmen as the typical bully. Just like other bullies, he is an antagonist who finds inflicting pain on others quite pleasurable. His mother fights with him and is a big bully just like him while his father seems to try to discipline him. He bullies Roy and calls him, &quot;Cowgirl&quot;. Dana was hit in the nose by Roy in an earlier chapter and doesn&#x27;t forget it. Despite the fact that Roy tries to make a truce with him, Dana never learns sense; this eventually leads to Dana paying the price when he is sent to a detention center as punishment for his mean attitude.
*Andrew and Lizzy Eberhardt – Roy&#x27;s parents. They are sensible and supportive. Mr. Eberhardt works in the federal Department of Justice, and helps Roy by checking Mother Paula&#x27;s building permits. Mrs. Eberhardt likes yoga and is protective of Roy.
* Chuck E. Muckle – The &quot;vice president of Corporate Relations&quot; at Mother Paula&#x27;s All-American Pancake House, and the novel&#x27;s primary antagonist. He is portrayed as an arrogant, manipulative, ruthless, and corrupt executive, who pretends owls do not live on the site so he can bulldoze over their homes.
* Leon and Lonna Leep – A couple majorly contrasting in personality, Mr. Leep is Beatrice&#x27;s decent but apathetic father, an ex-NBA player. He is remarried to a temperamental, mean-tempered, narcissistic waitress, Lonna Leep, who wants all the attention she can get, and has a volatile terrible relationship with Mullet Fingers, her son.
* Kimberly Lou Dixon – An actress and former Miss America runner-up who plays Mother Paula, the spokesperson and corporate mascot for Mother Paula&#x27;s All-American Pancake House.
* Garrett – Roy&#x27;s best and, at first, only friend at Trace Middle School. A skateboarder, popular in school, the king of phony farts, and a D student. His mother is also the school counselor.
* Viola Hennepin – The vice principal at Trace Middle School. She attempts to discipline Roy on several occasions such as suspending him from the school bus for two weeks, except she knows Dana strangled him. She is described as having one long jet-black hair protruding out of her upper lip; which later mysteriously becomes blonde.

==Publication history==
Carl Hiaasen started writing children&#x27;s books when he realized that the other novels that he had written were too adult for his nieces and nephews. In writing his first young adult novel, Hiaasen faced some challenges: &quot;The biggest challenge was trying not to subconsciously &#x27;write down&#x27; for young readers.&quot; Hiaasen said, &quot;When I was creating the character in &quot;Hoot&quot;, I&#x27;m sure I stole liberally from my pre-adolescence.&quot;

==Themes==
The themes in the novel are friendship, teamwork, growing up, corruption, parental love, kinship, environmentalism and integrity. The character goes through different adventures to get here.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; reviews read, “Hoot is quintessential Hiaasen … peopled with original and wacky characters… Not consistently a hoot, but worthy of a holler. Hiaasen&#x27;s first YA book succeeds as a humorous diversion.” &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; claims that &quot;With a Florida setting and pro-environment, anti-development message, Hiaasen returns to familiar turf for his first novel for young readers… Several suspenseful scenes, along with dollops of humor, help make this quite a hoot indeed.&quot;

==Adaptations==
A film adaptation of the book was released in May 2006, starring Luke Wilson as Officer Delinko, Logan Lerman as Roy Eberhart, Brie Larson as Beatrice Leep, Tim Blake Nelson as Leroy Brannit, Neil Flynn as Mr. Eberhart, Robert Wagner as Mayor Grandy, Cody Linley as Napoleon Leep, and Clark Gregg as Chuck Muckle while Hiaasen portrays Muckle&#x27;s assistant Felix. Hiaasen and Wil Shriner, the director and script-writer, &quot;fought long and hard to stay truthful to the book.&quot;

<text>Peace Park is a park located in the University District of Seattle, Washington, at the corner of Northeast 40th Street and 9th Avenue Northeast, at the northern end of the University Bridge. Its construction was conceived and led by Floyd Schmoe, winner of the 1988 Hiroshima Peace Prize, and dedicated on August 6, 1990, 45 years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

The park was home to a full-size bronze statue of Sadako Sasaki, sculpted by Daryl Smith, which was cut off at the ankles and stolen in July of 2024. Schoolchildren and other community members from around the city of Seattle frequently draped strings of peace cranes on the statue following the Japanese custom of the one thousand origami cranes.

==History==

Seattle&#x27;s Peace Park was dedicated on August 6, 1990, at the north end of University Bridge. The hillside site, which had been an unused area that was regularly crowded with garbage, was cleared and landscaped by volunteers under the leadership of peace activist Floyd Schmoe, the winner of the 1988 Hiroshima Peace Prize. Schmoe had been a University of Washington student during the incarceration of Japanese Americans and assisted fellow students affected by Executive Order 9066. He lobbied the city government to establish a peace park after receiving the 1988 Kiyoshi Tanimoto Peace Award from the Hiroshima Peace Center and used the $4,000 monetary award towards the project.

The centerpiece of the park is &quot;Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes&quot;, a bronze statue of Sadako Sasaki designed by sculptor Daryl Smith. Sasaki was a survivor of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima at the age of two but later died of leukemia a decade later. During her hospitalization, she aimed to fold one thousand origami cranes, which continue to be placed on her statues in Seattle and Hiroshima. , the statue is the only outdoor monument in Seattle&#x27;s municipal art collection that honors a female historical figure.

The efforts to fill the space under the statue with peace cranes come from Sadako&#x27;s own attempt to fold 1000 cranes. Although she died after making 644 cranes, her story inspired those around her to continue the work she began. The origami crane which is translated to &quot;orizuru&quot; in Japanese, carries a major cultural significance. It is believed that making 1000 cranes fulfills a person&#x27;s goals and dreams, and was later deemed a peace effort in honor of Sadako.

===Vandalism and upgrades===

In December 2003, the statue was vandalized leaving damage to the ankle and a cut off right arm of the statue. After the statue was vandalized, a number of people, including Sadako&#x27;s family, requested the statue be relocated to the more heavily trafficked Green Lake Park. Ultimately the Seattle Parks Department decided the statue should remain in the Peace Park, where it was re-installed in mid-January 2005. The statue was later restored after the community donated towards its repair and held a celebration continuing to honor Sasaki&#x27;s legacy.

In 2008, Peace Park was renovated by Seattle Parks and Recreation. This included new additions such as sidewalks, stairs, and pathways that connected other public parks and trails, such as the Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop. The statue was vandalized again in September 2012 but was later repaired.

On July 12, 2024, the statue was reported stolen by the Seattle Police Department. The majority of the statue was removed, except for the feet. A local historian speculated that the 2024 incident was not politically-motivated vandalism, but theft for monetary reasons.

<text>was a in service with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. She was the only member of her class to survive the war, and did so without suffering any major damage. She participated in the battles of the Java Sea, Midway, and Santa Cruz, helping to sink the submarine USS &quot;Perch&quot;, and saw her first major surface action at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, sinking the destroyer &quot;USS Laffey&quot; and helping to sink the destroyer &quot;USS Cushing&quot;, alongside crippling the destroyer USS &quot;Sterett&quot; and lightly damaging the destroyer USS &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;. She survived the devastating naval defeat that was the Battle of the Bismarck Sea undamaged, and led a Japanese counter attack at the Battle of Kolombangara, where she likely directly torpedoed the light cruiser HMNZS &quot;Leander&quot; and took part in a mass torpedo spread that sank the destroyer USS &quot;Gwin&quot; and torpedoed the light cruisers USS &quot;Honolulu&quot; and USS &quot;Saint Louis&quot;.

&quot;Yukikaze&quot; undertook escort missions during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and later took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, surviving the allied attacks that sank dozens of Japanese ships and engaging the escort carriers and destroyers of Taffy 3, firing torpedoes at US escort carriers without obtaining a hit and engaging the destroyer USS &quot;Johnston&quot;. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; saw her last major action escorting and witnessing the sinking of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; during the Battle of Okinawa, before surviving the war, being the only ship of her class to do so. 

Following the war, the ship was transferred to the Republic of China Navy, where she was renamed Dan Yang ( DD-12) and served until 1966, taking part in two shore bombardment missions and capturing two oil tankers and a cargo ship, before being scrapped in 1970.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Kagerō&quot; class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding of destroyers. Their crew numbered 240 officers and enlisted men. The ships measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a designed speed of . However, the class proved capable of exceeding 35.5 knots on sea trials. The ships were designed with a range of at a speed of . However, the class more accurately proved to have a range of on trials.

The main armament of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class consisted of six Type 3 guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. They were built with four Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons originally consisted of 16 depth charges, but this was upgraded to 36 depth charges by June of 1942. As the war went on, any remaining &quot;Kagerō&quot; class destroyers by 1944 had their X turret removed and replaced by up to 28 25-mm guns.

==Career in Imperial Japanese Navy==
&quot;Yukikaze&quot; was laid down on August 2 1938, launched on March 24 1939, and completed on January 20 1940, and upon commissioning she was appointed as the third ship of destroyer division 16 (&quot;Kuroshio, Hatsukaze, Yukikaze&quot;) and immediately saw a series of peacetime patrol duties and visits to foreign harbors. On 11 October 1940, Yukikaze took part in the 2,600 year anniversary Japanese navy fleet review, the last major fleet review before the start of the Pacific Theater. Then, at the end of 1940, the 16th destroyer division was reorganized; &quot;Kuroshio&quot; was reappointed to destroyer division 15, while the newly completed destroyers &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; joined the group, and &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was appointed as flagship of Captain Shibuyu Shiro, while commander Tobida Kenjirō took personal leadership of the destroyer. 

=== Beginning of the Pacific War ===
During the start of World War 2 for Japan, 7 December 1941, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; led destroyer division 16 in escorting the light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot; during an air raid on Davao. Throughout the rest of December and into January of 1942, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort invasion convoys heading to Legaspi, Lamon Bay, Menado, Kendari, and Ambon. On February 20, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort the invasion force destined for Timor. Then, on the 27th, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would see her first active combat role taking part in the battle of the Java Sea, the destruction of the allied surface ships attempting to defend the Dutch East Indies against Japanese invasion. However, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; only led a torpedo attack that failed to land a single hit. In the aftermath of the battle, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; rescued some 40 survivors from several sunken allied warships. Commander Tobida interrogated Captain Thomas Spencer, the highest ranking member of the survivors who had served as a gunnery chief on the destroyer HMS &quot;Electra&quot;, which was sunk in a gunfight with the destroyer &quot;Asagumo&quot;. No relevant information was found, but Spencer reportedly conversed about his birthplace in Scotland and graduation from the Britannia Royal Naval College. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; then transferred the prisoners to the recently captured hospital ship &quot;Op Ten Noort&quot;. Immediately after, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; located the submarine USS &quot;S-37&quot; and dropped 10 depth charges, completely destroying her starboard engine, breaking her coolers, and causing major flooding and an oil leak, forcing &quot;S-37&quot; to retreat to Australia for immense repairs.

After the Dutch East Indies were successfully invaded, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took part in various anti-submarine operations throughout March. On the 3rd, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was operating in the Java Sea when her consort, the &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, spotted the crippled submarine USS &quot;Perch&quot;. &quot;Perch&quot; had been previously damaged by the destroyers &quot;Minegumo&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&quot; on 1 March, then further crippled by the destroyers &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot; the next day, with the combined damage preventing her from diving and destroying three of her four engines, cutting her speed to five knots; &quot;Yukikaze&quot; promptly joined &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; in blasting &quot;Perch&quot; with gunfire and finished the crippled submarine off. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; continued submarine patrols, but had no further encounters, then escorted the invasion force for New Guinea before returning to Davao. From 26 April to 2 May, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was drydocked for maintenance, then steamed from Kure to Saipan.

In preparation for the Battle of Midway, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort a number of troop transports for the phase of the battle which involved the invasion of Midway Island. However, through June 3 to June 6, the battle turned into one of the most devastating naval defeats of the entire war. Four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser were sunk by American aircraft carrier raids, prompting the invasion forces to retreat. After the battle, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; joined the main body force, and assisted the crippled heavy cruiser &quot;Mogami&quot;. 

With such a blunder out of the way, it was off to the Guadalcanal campaign. Around this time, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would receive a new captain, Ryokichi Kanma, and after a series a training missions, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would see some action again as an aircraft carrier escort at the battle of Santa Cruz, October 26. American aircraft carrier attacks damaged a number of Japanese vessels (but failed to sink any), but the attacks were mostly focused on the carriers as &quot;Yukikaze&quot; remained undamaged. The Japanese planes in turn sank the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Hornet&quot; and the destroyer USS &quot;Porter&quot;, and damaged or crippled several other vessels. With the battle concluded in a victory, the Japanese ships returned to Truk on October 30.

=== Naval Battle of Guadalcanal ===
&quot;Yukikaze&quot; saw her first notable action in what would combinate into the first naval battle of Guadalcanal. With a goal of conducting another major bombardment on Henderson Field, a former Japanese air base which was captured by US forces and being used against Japanese shipping to great effect, the main ships of the force consisted of the battleships &quot;Hiei&quot; and &quot;Kirishima&quot;, each armed with eight 14-inch (356 mm) guns and a variety of smaller guns. &quot;Hiei&quot; served as Admiral Abe&#x27;s flagship. Escorting the force came the light cruiser &quot;Nagara&quot;, and a total of eleven destroyers, including &quot;Yukikaze.&quot; The force departed on the 9th of November 1942&quot;.&quot; While the destroyers initially operated in a standard formation, heavy rain squalls had managed to break up the formation and leave the destroyers operating in small clusters, in turn leaving &quot;Yukikaze&quot; operating alongside the destroyers &quot;Amastukaze&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot;.

In the early morning of the 13th, the force was en route when by 1:25, signs of enemy ships began to appear. A force of two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers had intercepted the force. By 1:48, &quot;Hiei&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Akatsuki&quot; illuminated the light cruiser USS &quot;Atlanta&quot;, starting the battle in a point blank range skirmish which resulted in both &quot;Akatsuki&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s&quot; sinking&quot;.&quot; &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Teruzuki&quot; quickly rushed into action (they were not joined by &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, which was blocked by the battleships and instead broke off from formation to engage and sink the destroyer USS &quot;Barton)&quot;. With the US formation left a scattered mess due to poor command decisions by Admiral Callaghan, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, along with &quot;Teruzuki&quot; (possibly joined by &quot;Nagara&quot;) engaged the lead American destroyer, USS &quot;Cushing&quot;. &quot;Cushing&quot; fired back at &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, and though no hits were scored machine gunfire killed a sailor on the deck, &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; first casualty. However, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; helped to inflict far more damage than she received, a barrage of Japanese shell hits disabled &quot;Cushing&#x27;s&quot; electrical power and guns, leaving her dead in the water and set aflame. With &quot;Cushing&quot; rendered a defenseless floating wreck she was eventually abandoned at 2:30 and left to sink several hours later, losing 70 men in the process.
With an enemy destroyer on her kill sheet, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; just before 2:00 spotted the destroyer USS &quot;Laffey&quot;, which had just escaped a point blank range duel with &quot;Hiei&quot; where she raked her with gunfire, wounding admiral Abe and killing much of his staff, and had just taken a 14-inch (356 mm) shell hit from &quot;Hiei&quot; to her amidships superstructure that caused little critical damage. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; fired her torpedo battery, one of which hit &quot;Laffey&quot; aft, blowing her stern clean off, breaking her keel, disabling all electrical power, and starting a massive fire. The abandon ship order was issued as the massive fire caused by &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedo hit suddenly blew up &quot;Laffey&#x27;s&quot; turret 4 magazines and sank her instantly with the loss of 59 men.

As the destroyer USS &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; swerved to evade the sinking &quot;Laffey&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; noticed her and briefly opened fire. No hits were scored, but a near miss detonated underneath the keel, temporarily disrupting &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s&quot; lighting and power. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; continued on sweeping for targets, and near the end of the battle she managed to ambush the destroyer USS &quot;Sterett&quot; and hit the destroyer with eleven 5-inch (127 mm) shells. The damage destroyed &quot;Sterett&#x27;s&quot; aft guns and torpedo tubes, set her on fire, killed 28 men and injured 13 others. However, all damage was inflicted above the waterline as &quot;Sterett&quot; limped away on her functional engine.

However, during a point-blank range gunfight &quot;Hiei&quot; was crippled by a pair of 8-inch (203 mm) shell hits fired from the heavy cruiser USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; that disabled her steering gear. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; attempted to assist the crippled &quot;Hiei&quot;, but aircraft from both Henderson Field and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; attacked the vulnerable battleship, scoring several bomb hits which served as the final blow. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; came under light air attacks, and through a bomb near miss cracked a boiler no hits were scored, and damage was only minor. Admiral Abe transferred his flag to &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, joined by a large quantity of &quot;Hiei&quot; survivors, before &quot;Yukikaze&quot; assisted in scuttling &quot;Hiei with&quot; torpedo hits. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; then withdrew from the battle to both transfer &quot;Hiei&quot; survivors and escort damaged and crippled Japanese ships to Truk, arriving to their destination on the 18th.

==== Operation Ke ====
&quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort the aircraft carrier between December 5-10 and the carriers and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; between January 18-23. With the start of 1943, Japan had finally decided to cut their losses and retreat from Guadalcanal, allowing an allied takeover of the Island. From February 1-4, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was one of the 20 destroyers that took part in both the first and second evacuations of Japanese troop&quot;. Yukikaze&quot; in particular transported the 17th army to safety. At a meeting at combined fleet headquarters, it was debated whether to use high speed motor boats for the final evacuation, but Captain Kanma, along with other destroyer commanders insisted that the evacuation was a job for their destroyers, even shouting together at some points. The Japanese command gave in, and &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took part in the final evacuation of Guadalcanal, February 7-8. The evacuation was completely successful, and allied attacks were very light, only sinking the destroyer &quot;Makigumo&quot; and the submarine &quot;I-1&quot;. The Japanese in total rescued 10,652 troops from Guadalcanal.

During the evacuation, the destroyer &quot;Maikaze&quot; was moderately damaged by air attacks, prompting &quot;Yukikaze&quot; to escort her to Truk from February 10 to the 14th, before she escorted the transport ship &quot;Gokoku Maru&quot; from Rabaul to New Britain and back.

=== Battle of the Bismarck Sea ===
It wasn&#x27;t long until &quot;Yukikaze&quot; felt the heat of action again. Lae was in desperate need of resupplyment in order to turn back General MacArthur&#x27;s forces from New Guinea, and the 51st army division had just the heavy artillery to do that. A total of eight troop ships were sent out to reinforce Lae, escorted by eight destroyers, including &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;. Transiting through the Bismarck Sea on March 1, allied reconnaissance planes spotted the force by 15:00. At the dawn of March 2, a squadron of B-17s attacked, sinking the troop ship &quot;Kyokusei Maru&quot; and damaging two more, prompting &quot;Yukikaze&quot; to assist in rescuing survivors. The next day, a second wave failed to sink any ships, but scattered the force, leaving the ships vulnerable, and when a third wave attacked, they sank a troop ship and the destroyer &quot;Arashio&quot;, and fatally wounded the destroyers &quot;Shirayuki&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; removed &quot;Tokitsukaze&#x27;s&quot; crew while others scuttled &quot;Shirayuki&quot;. Wave after wave of B-17s and B-25s attacked the force, and through heavy fighting all the remaining six troop ships were all sunk, alongside finishing off the crippled &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and the other destroyers attempted to rescue as many survivors as possible, as they did so a final wave of B-17s sank the destroyer &quot;Asashio&quot; with most of her crew.

With the battle of the Bismarck Sea lasting from March 2-4, all eight troop ships and four of the eight destroyers were sunk. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; survived completely undamaged. Having rescued survivors from several sunken ships, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; ferried them to Rabaul, arriving at her destination on March 5th. Immediately afterwards, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; sailed for a troop transport run to Kolombangara, arriving on March 7. Throughout the rest of March and into April, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took part in troop transport runs to Kolombangara, Rekata, Finschhafen, and Tuluvu. From May 3 to May 8, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was drydocked and was refitted with radar and additional anti-aircraft guns, before taking part in a troop transport run to Nauru and back. 

=== Battle of Kolombangara ===
On July 9, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; departed on another troop transport run to Kolombangara. Protecting four destroyer transports carrying some 1,200 ground troops, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; due to her radar was the lead ship in a flotilla of destroyers, leading the destroyers &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, &quot;Kiyonami&quot;, and &quot;Yūgure&quot;. The four destroyers operated alongside the Japanese flagship, the light cruiser &quot;Jintsū&quot;, as well as the elderly destroyer &quot;Mikazuki&quot;. 

The first three days of the run went relatively smoothly, but en route the force was spotted by allied coastwatchers, who relayed their information to allied intelligence. Hoping to ambush the Japanese ships, Admiral Ainsworth scrambled up a force consisting of the American light cruisers USS &quot;Honolulu&quot; and USS &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, alongside the New Zealand light cruiser HMNZS &quot;Leander&quot;, supported by 10 destroyers.

By 1:03 on the 13th, the allied ships were about 10,400 yards (9,500 meters) away from the Japanese task force, when in a critical moment, &quot;Jintsū&quot; illuminated the enemy ships with her searchlights. &quot;Honolulu&quot;, &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, and &quot;Leander&quot; all fired at &quot;Jintsū&quot;, drawing the complete attention of the allied ships and away from &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and the other destroyers. While &quot;Mikazuki&quot; stayed behind to assist &quot;Jintsū&quot;, Captain Kanma led his destroyers to partake in a torpedo attack on the allied ships, closing to 5,250 yards (4,800 meters) away from the enemy. At 1:20, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, &quot;Kiyonami&quot;, and &quot;Yūgure&quot; each fired a full spread of torpedoes at the allied ships. It was four minutes later that a long lance torpedo (probably) from &quot;Yukikaze&quot; made a critical hit as it slammed into &quot;Leander&quot; amidships as she was attempting to complete a turn. &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; hit killed 23 sailors and forced &quot;Leander&quot; to retire from the battle with severe damage. &quot;Leander&quot; was damaged so badly she could not be repaired in time to take further part in WW2, and on top of that never served as a New Zealand warship again, being decommissioned in May of 1944 and transferred to the British Navy in September of 1945. 

In turn, the Japanese ships failed to save &quot;Jintsū&quot;. After being shelled into a floating wreck by gunfire mostly from &quot;Honolulu&quot; and &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, American destroyers closed to point blank range to deliver the final blow. At least one torpedo probably from USS &quot;Taylor&quot; made its mark, breaking &quot;Jintsū&quot; in half and finally finishing the cruiser off. This did not stop Kanma from ordering another torpedo strike against the allied ships. In just 18 minutes, the torpedo tubes on all four destroyers were fully reloaded and ready to fire. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; led the other destroyers to another torpedo attack, and by 1:50 had closed to around 4,900 yards (4,500 meters), Every allied ship that could fire their guns focused their attention on &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, which took some light damage from straddles and near misses. However, much to the amazement of &quot;Hamakaze&#x27;s&quot; crew, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was not directly hit by even a single shell. The destroyers promptly fired their torpedoes. While the scorers of the following hits are rather ambiguous, at 2:18 the first and second torpedo hits crippled &quot;Honolulu&quot;. One landed aft but was a dud, but the other landed forward and blew the cruiser&#x27;s bow clean off. A third torpedo hit badly damaged &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, twisting her bow to the port side. A fourth and final torpedo fatally damaged the destroyer USS &quot;Gwin&quot;. The torpedo destroyed her engine room and caused significant flooding, forcing &quot;Gwin&quot; to be scuttled.

While the battle was a costly victory with the loss of &quot;Jintsū&quot;, it was a victory none the less. Alongside the numerous allied ships sunk or critically damaged, the destroyer transports made it to Kolombangara and unloaded all 1,200 soldiers to reinforce the area. On July 19, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would take part in another troop transport run to Kolombangara, where en route both &quot;Kiyonami&quot; and &quot;Yūgure&quot; were sunk by land-based bombers the next day. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; saw another troop transport run to Kolombangara on the 23rd before departing from Rabaul to Truk, then escorting Japanese ships to Kure. From August to September 3, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would undergo a major refit, which removed her aft superfiring 5-inch (127 mm) gun turret and replaced it with a pair of triple 25 mm machine guns, with the addition of more anti-aircraft guns and updated type 22 and type 13 radar. Upon refit, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would spend the rest of 1943 taking part in various escorting duties. On December 10, Ryokichi Kanma was relieved of duty and replaced with captain Terauchi Masamichi.

=== Philippine Campaign ===
&quot;Main Article: Philippines campaign (1944–1945)&quot;

&quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort escorted high speed tankers from Moji to Singapore from the 11th to 20th of January 1944, during which her consort, the &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, was damaged beyond repair by a torpedo fired from the submarine USS &quot;Redfin&quot;. She then immediately afterwards escorted the light carrier &quot;Chitose&quot; and convoy HI-32 back to Moji, before escorting &quot;Chitose&quot; to Saipan and Yokosuka, then escorting the light carrier &quot;Zuihō&quot; to Guam throughout February and March. From April 20th to May 1st, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; escorted Japanese warships from Kure to Lingga. On May 22nd, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; scraped her hull on a reef while patrolling off Tawitawi, cutting her speed to 25 knots, which was more damage than any enemy forces had managed to inflict throughout her career.

Upon being repaired, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would be tasked to take part in Operation A-Go, a planned decisive battle to protect the Philippines from allied liberation. With the fall of most of the Soloman Islands territories, the Philippines acted as a crucial supply line between mainland Japan and the Dutch East Indies. If the Philippines were taken over, it would sever the supply line and render Japan unable to function as a wartime economy. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would see a major role escorting crucial oil tankers from submarine attack to operate with the Japanese ships, otherwise the force wouldn&#x27;t have enough fuel to operate. This still enraged captain Masamichi, since his ship was relegated to mere escorting duties, reportedly stating he would rather have &quot;Yukikaze&quot; sunk in battle than not see combat.

In the afternoon of June 17, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would fulfill her role when she protected the tankers from the submarine USS &quot;Cavalla&quot;. Two days later, the Japanese aircraft carriers launching raids on American warships, but only managed to damage the battleship USS &quot;South Dakota&quot;. In turn, &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; crew would witness the battle turn into a crippling defeat for the Japanese navy as submarine attacks sank the new armored aircraft carrier &quot;Taihō&quot; and the Kido Butai veteran aircraft carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, the latter having been sunk by &quot;Cavalla&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes. American aircraft from USS &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; on the 20th sank the aircraft carrier &quot;Hiyō&quot;, before planes from USS &quot;Wasp&quot; attacked &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; group, fatally damaging the oil tankers &quot;Gen&#x27;yo Maru&quot; and &quot;Seiyo Maru&quot;. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; removed &quot;Seiyo Maru&#x27;s&quot; crew before scuttling her, while others did the same to &quot;Gen&#x27;yo Maru&quot;. Alongside the multiple Japanese ships sunk, American forces destroyed over 400 Japanese aircraft. The battle effectively destroyed Japan&#x27;s carrier fleet as a fighting force.

Having survived the battle of the completely undamaged, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would escort the surviving oil tankers to Kure, arriving to their destination on July 2, before being drydocked from July 5 to August 15. She would not leave Kure until September 25th, when she escorted the battleships &quot;Fusō&quot; and &quot;Yamashiro&quot; to Lingga.

=== Battle of Leyte Gulf ===
On October 20, Yukikaze arrived at Brunei to meet up with the rest of the Japanese fleet intended to take part in Operation Sho-Go. Due to the destruction of Japan&#x27;s carrier fleet, their plan was to use their mostly intact surface fleet to engage and sink American troop convoys heading towards the Leyte Gulf and whatever escorts protected them, using the remnants of Japan&#x27;s carrier task force armed with Kamikaze suicide bombers to distract the large naval fleets led by Admiral Halsey. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; departed on 22nd with Admiral Kurita&#x27;s centerforce, consisting of Japan&#x27;s &quot;super battleships&quot;, &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Musashi&quot;, the largest and most powerful battleships ever built, alongside the older but capable battleships &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Kongō&quot;, and &quot;Haruna&quot;, escorted by 10 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and 15 destroyers including &quot;Yukikaze&quot;.

On the 23rd, the plan would immediately begin to fall apart as the opening stages of the battle of Leyte Gulf began. Torpedo attacks from the submarines USS &quot;Darter&quot; and USS &quot;Dace&quot; sank the heavy cruisers &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; and damaged the heavy cruiser &quot;Takao&quot; beyond repair, forcing her out of the battle alongside the destroyers &quot;Naganami&quot; and &quot;Asashimo&quot; to escort her. On the 24th, the centerforce came under the much fear US carrier attacks in what would become known as the battle of the Sibuyan Sea. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; got off undamaged, but a number of ships were damaged, notably the heavy cruiser &quot;Myōkō&quot; was forced to withdraw from the battle due to an aerial torpedo hit, taking the destroyers &quot;Hamakaze&quot; and &quot;Kiyoshimo&quot; with her for protection. A low number of Japanese ships were actually sunk, but that was because the air attacks were mostly focused on Musashi. Over a seven hour long battle, Musashi was hit by a minimum of 17 bombs and 19-20 torpedoes, leaving her dead in the water and adrift. It would take a further two hours for the crippled Musashi to slip beneath the waves and sink by the bow.

==== Battle off Samar ====
Admiral Kurita ordered a retreat from the battle. However, two hours later, he revealed the retreat to be false and ordered the center force to steam back to the battle. The false retreat successfully fooled the American forces into believing the centerforce was well out of the battle, and following the annihilation of Admiral Nishimura&#x27;s Southern Force at the battle of the Surigao Strait, when US forces discovered the decoy carrier force, Admiral Halsey took his ships to engaged it, leaving the troop convoys vulnerable. By the morning of the 25th, the centerforce was diminished to four battlships, six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eleven destroyers. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was left operating alongside the destroyers &quot;Isokaze&quot;, &quot;Urakaze&quot;, and &quot;Nowaki&quot;, led by the light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot;. Just before 6:00, the force would come into contact with Taffy 3, a group of six small escort carriers, three destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. &quot;Yamato&quot; fired the first salvos into the battle, followed by the other large warships, opening up the battle off Samar. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would take part in a torpedo attack on the escort carriers USS &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; and USS &quot;Saint Lo&quot;. However, none of the torpedoes made their mark. In particular, a Japanese torpedo was dangerously close to hitting &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot; when US fighters intercepted and destroyed it with machine gunfire.

&quot;Yukikaze&quot; and the other destroyers would then notice the limping destroyer USS &quot;Johnston&quot;. By that point, &quot;Johnston&quot; had already been crippled by three 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells and three 6.1-inch (155 mm) shells from &quot;Yamato,&quot; being left with only two functional 5-inch (127 mm) guns and her top speed was cut to 17 knots. The five ships engaged &quot;Johnston.&quot; &quot;Yahagi&quot; scored hits that disabled Johnston&#x27;s turret 2 and started a fire that forced the evacuation of the bridge before being turned away by attacking aircraft. &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;, &quot;Urakaze&quot;, and &quot;Nowaki&quot; blasted &quot;Johnston&quot;, disabling her only remaining gun and her remaining engines, leaving her dead in the water, destroying her radio control room and main mast, and setting the ship aflame. Under sustained gunfire, &quot;Johnston&quot; lost all remaining structural integrity she had and split in two where she was hit by an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot; earlier in the battle. As &quot;Johnston&quot; sank, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; closed to point blank range, not for an attack, but to salute the valiant destroyer for her bravery, with Captain Masamichi personally paying his respects to the US sailors and a large number of the crew doing the same. This would prove to be the last time &quot;Yukikaze&quot; engaged enemy ships during her service in the Japanese navy.

Throughout the battle, air attacks sank the heavy cruisers &quot;Chōkai&quot;, &quot;Chikuma&quot;, and &quot;Suzuya&quot;, as well as damaging other ships. Combined with the previous losses faced during the battle, Admiral Kurita finally lost his nerve. Believing he had sunk several fleet carriers and cruisers, he ordered a retreat from the battle, leaving the troop convoys untouched. Throughout the next few days, further air attacks sank the light cruiser &quot;Noshiro&quot; and several destroyers, but &quot;Yukikaze&quot; came out without being hit. By the 27th, the battle of Leyte Gulf was over, and on the 28th, what remained of Kurita&#x27;s centerforce managed to return to Brunei, during which &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was refueled by &quot;Haruna&quot;.
=== Final months of the war ===
While stuck in Brunei, the Japanese fleet would come under air attacks, during which strafing from fighters killed one of &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; machine gunners, prompting her crew to hold a funeral on the deck. As American forces slowly but successfully liberated the Philippines, the Japanese ships desperately needed to evacuate the increasingly dangerous area. In November, Japanese warships would begin to flee the area, culminating on the 16th when the main fleet left Brunai permanently and set sail to Kure, with &quot;Yukikaze&quot; being assigned to protect the capital ships. On the 22nd, both the battleship &quot;Kongō&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Urakaze&quot; were torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS &quot;Sealion&quot;, but &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and the rest of the force successfully arrived at Kure on the 24th. The next day, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; escorted the battleship &quot;Nagato&quot; to Yokosuka.

==== Escorting the Shinano ====
Upon arriving at Yokosuka, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would be assigned to an important mission. The Japanese aircraft carrier &quot;Shinano&quot; was one of Japan&#x27;s largest warships, having been converted from a Yamato class battleship. Several days earlier, she was spotted by a B-29 bomber, and due to Japan fearing follow up air attacks, &quot;Shinano&quot; was commissioned before being fully fitted out, most crucially her watertight doors were either not installed correctly or not installed at all. &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, along with &quot;Isokaze&quot; and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; were tasked with escorting &quot;Shinano&quot; from Yokosuka to Kure. The four ships departed on the 28th. However, en route just after 3:00 on the 29th, signs of an enemy submarine began to appear. &quot;Isokaze&quot; signaled to &quot;Yukikaze&quot; to defense &quot;Shinano&quot;, but she never received the message. Fearing a wolf pack, &quot;Shinano&quot; undertook maneuvers, which ironically showed a full broadside to the lone submarine USS &quot;Archerfish&quot;. Archerfish fired a spread of torpedoes, four of which hit their mark. Admiral Abe initially ignored the damage, given how many hits her half sistership &quot;Musashi&quot; took before sinking, but over several hours as it became clear that fatal damage was inflicted due to the incomplete nature of the ship, it was too late. Even if &quot;Shinano&quot; was complete, according to some accounts in the presence of flooding pumps and other damage control equipment, whatever crew &quot;Shinano&quot; had instead resorted to forming bucket chains throughout the ship. By 11:00, &quot;Shinano&quot; fully capsized and sank, with &quot;Yukikaze&quot; picking up several survivors.

Upon &quot;Shinano&#x27;s&quot; sinking, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; retreated to Moji. She would remain there until December 29, when she escorted a troop convoy to Formosa and back. From January to March of 1945, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; would take part in a number of training exercises. During this time, the &quot;Shigure&quot;, the destroyer sent to replace &quot;Yukikaze&quot; on escorting duties, was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS &quot;Blackfin&quot;.

==== Operation Ten Go ====

In April of 1945, an invasion of Okinawa, Japan&#x27;s last defensible position besides the mainland itself was imminent. While the army was willing to do anything it could to defend Okinawa, the navy was more concerned with reserving what few ships it had for the eventual battle on mainland Japan. However, Emperor Hirohito reportedly questioned the navy&#x27;s lack of action to defend Okinawa, and thus a plan was scrambled up. The navy would send out battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; on a mission to beach herself on the Island and act as a stationary unsinkable gun fortress to destroy allied landing convoys. In turn, an escort was quickly scrambled up to protect &quot;Yamato&quot;. The plan was named Operation Ten-Go, becoming part of the overall battle of Okinawa.

&quot;Yukikaze&quot; would be one of nine escorts tasked with defending Yamato from any potential allied attacks. She would be reunited with a number of ships she fought with in previous battles, such as the light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Hamakaze,&quot; &quot;Isokaze,&quot; and &quot;Asashimo.&quot; She would also serve with other warships for the first (and last) time, such as the destroyers &quot;Hatsushimo&quot;, &quot;Kasumi&quot;, &quot;Fuyutsuki&quot;, and &quot;Suzutsuki&quot;. On April 6, the force departed Tokuyama. Just a few hours later, they were spotted by US submarines, which couldn&#x27;t attack due to the force&#x27;s high cruising speed, but still radioed the Japanese ship&#x27;s location. Throughout the rest of the day and into the 7th, the force was trailed by Catalina floatplanes.

By 11:30, the Japanese ships would be attacked by a total of 386 aircraft from US aircraft carriers. Planes from USS &quot;San Jacinto&quot; quickly sank &quot;Asashimo&quot;, which was suffering engine trouble, before sinking &quot;Hamakaze&quot; as well. Further air attacks quickly overpowered and sank &quot;Yahagi&quot;, and as &quot;Isokaze&quot; attempted to assist her, she too was fatally damaged by bomb hits. By that point, &quot;Isokaze&quot; was the last Kagerō class destroyer still afloat besides &quot;Yukikaze&quot;. Dive bombers then fatally damaged &quot;Kasumi,&quot; while torpedo bombers crippled &quot;Suzutuki&quot; with a torpedo that blew off her bow. With most of her escorts either sunk or out of the fight, the remaining air attacks all focused on &quot;Yamato&quot;, which was already badly damaged. Over a three hour long battle, &quot;Yamato&quot; took at least 7 bombs and 11-13 torpedoes before she sank in a massive magazine explosion, sinking faster to less hits than &quot;Musashi&quot; due to being attacked at the port side only as opposed to any angle. For her part, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; survived the battle with only strafing damage, killing 3 sailors and injuring 15 others. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; first rescued survivors from &quot;Yamato&quot;. Afterwards, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; approached the floating wreck that was &quot;Isokaze&quot;, and removed her crew before scuttling the last of her sisterships, while others did the same to &quot;Kasumi&quot;.&quot;Yukikaze&quot; steamed to the Sasebo after the ordeal was over, where she dropped off &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot; survivors. Throughout the rest of April and into May, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was limited to patrol duties, and eventually with Japan&#x27;s oil reserves almost entirely depleted, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; could not even set sail and was stuck in port without fuel. On May 30, carrier aircraft attacked Maizuru harbor, and while no direct hits were scored on &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, shrapnel damaged killed one sailor and injured 20 others to varying degrees. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was given enough fuel to escape Maizuru along with &quot;Hatsushimo&quot;. During the journey, &quot;Hatsushimo&quot; struck a mine and was forced to run aground, but &quot;Yukikaze&quot; successfully arrived at Ōjima. Upon arrival, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was camouflaged, and spent the rest of the war anchored on security duties. On July 30th, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took further minor damage from aircraft strafing, killing one man and injuring several others.

As a result of participating in and surviving some of the most dangerous battles the IJN had fought while avoiding any major damage whatsoever, never being hit by a single naval shell, torpedo, or air dropped bomb, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; is called &quot;the unsinkable ship&quot; and &quot;the miracle ship&quot;. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took part in more than 10 major battles, and more than 100 escort missions and resupply transport missions during World War II.

=== End of the war ===

After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on August 15 1945, Emperor Hirohito announced that the Japanese would unconditionally surrender to allied forces. Upon the announcement, &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; camouflage was removed, and her crew prepared for the war&#x27;s end, which included secret documents on the ship being destroyed. A day after the former Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay, she was inspected by allied intelligence. &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was stripped of all her guns, and like many surviving Japanese warships she would be used to transport Japanese prisoners of war. &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; name was written in English on both sides of the hull. 

== ROCS &quot;Dan Yang&quot; ==
On 6 July 1947, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was transferred to the Republic of China as a war reparation, where she was renamed Dan Yang ( DD-12). All destroyers were named after Yang regardless of country of origin.

&quot;Dan Yang&quot; served as flagship of the Republic of China Navy. It was an unarmed training vessel until 1952. In 1953, it was fitted with Type 89 12.7 cm/40 dual mounted guns, in addition to the Type 98 10cm/65 dual mounted guns already in use. In 1956, &quot;Dan Yang&quot; had all the Japanese armaments removed and replaced with three open air mounted 5&quot;/38 caliber guns, 3&quot;/50 caliber guns replaced the torpedo tubes, Bofors 40 mm guns, and newer depth charge launchers. The Republic of China Navy had no use for the original torpedo tubes as they did not have access to the appropriate armaments.

She is notable for visiting Manila where 50,000 overseas Chinese visited her in August 1953. &quot;Dan Yang&quot;″s service included patrolling the South China Sea and intercepting incoming ships carrying wartime materials into Shanghai. On 4 October 1953, she captured the Polish civilian oil tanker &quot;Praca&quot; at &quot;21°06&#x27;N 122°48&#x27;E&quot; in the West Pacific Ocean, 125 sea miles southeast of Taiwan. On 12 May 1954, she bombarded and captured another Polish civilian freighter &quot;Prezydent Gottwald&quot; with machinery and medicines at &quot;23°45&#x27;N 128°35&#x27;E&quot;. On 23 June 1954, she captured the civilian oil tanker &quot;Tuapse&quot; of the Soviet Union carrying kerosene eastbound at in the high sea of Balintang Channel near Philippines All ships were confiscated into the ROC Navy list, and the crews were either released, executed or detained for various time frames up to 35 years in captivity till 1988. She also saw action along the Taiwan Strait in a supporting role as she was one of the few ships with long range guns. However, the arrival of surplus US destroyers entering service put the famous destroyer that once served as flagship into retirement, and she was scrapped in 1970 after being damaged beyond repair in a typhoon in 1969.

In Japan, there was a campaign to have her returned to Japan from Taiwan for preservation as a museum ship since she was a symbol of longevity. Her rudder and one of her anchors were repatriated to the Japan Navy Academy Museum as a good will gesture.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Yukikaze&quot; was prominently featured in the final act of the 2023 Japanese movie &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; and played a key role in the finale and the defeat of Godzilla, being one of four destroyers to catch the monster in a trap (alongside &quot;Hibiki&quot;, &quot;Yūkaze&quot;, and &quot;Keyaki&quot;).

While &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Hibiki&quot; both play equal roles in defeating Godzilla, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; is the main focus of the battle due to being sailed by several main characters, and her fame in Japanese pop culture.

<text>Fyodor Ivanovich Tolbukhin (; 16 June 1894 – 17 October 1949) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union. He is regarded as one of the finest Soviet generals of World War II.

Born into a peasant family in Yaroslavl, Tolbukhin volunteered for the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War and served with distinction. He joined the Red Army in 1918 and fought in the Russian Civil War. After graduating from the Frunze Military Academy, he held a succession of commands, rising to the post of chief of staff of the Transcaucasian Military District by 1938. Tolbukhin rose further through the ranks following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and was involved in the Battle of Stalingrad. As commander of the 4th Ukrainian Front, he assisted Rodion Malinovsky in the Lower Dnieper and Dnieper–Carpathian offensives. He then contributed to the Soviet drive into the Balkans and forced Romania&#x27;s defection to the Allies, for which he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, Tolbukhin took part in the occupation of Bulgaria and liberated much of Yugoslavia after the Belgrade offensive. He commanded the Vienna offensive in May 1945 and helped set up the new Austrian government under Karl Renner.

After the war, Tolbukhin received command of the Southern Group of Forces in the Balkans before returning to the Transcaucasus. He held the post until his death in October 1949 from diabetes.

==Early life and military career==
Tolbukhin was born into a peasant family in the province of Yaroslavl, north-east of Moscow. He volunteered for the Imperial Army in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. He was steadily promoted, advancing from private to captain by 1916. He was also decorated for bravery multiple times.

In August 1918 Tolbukhin joined the Red Army, where he served as the chief of staff of the 56th infantry division. After the Russian Civil War ended (1921), Tolbukhin was given a number of staff positions. He also attended the Frunze Military Academy for advanced staff training, graduating in 1931. In 1937, after a series of staff positions, Tolbukhin was given command of a division. In 1938, he was made chief of staff of the Transcaucasus Military District.

==World War II==

Tolbukhin remained in this position through the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa until August 1941, when he was made the chief of staff of the Crimean Front, which he held until March 1942. From May to July 1942, he was the assistant commander of the Stalingrad Military District. After that, he was the commander of the 57th Army until March 1943. The 57th was involved in the Battle of Stalingrad, where Tolbukhin&#x27;s superior, Colonel-General Andrei Yeremenko, praised his command organization and military prowess. After his command of the 57th, Tolbukhin was placed in command of the Southern Front.
In October 1943 the Southern Front was renamed 4th Ukrainian Front. Tolbukhin assisted Rodion Malinovsky&#x27;s 3rd Ukrainian Front in the Lower Dnieper Offensive and Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive. In May 1944, Tolbukhin was transferred to control of 3rd Ukrainian Front. During the Summer Campaign, from June to October 1944, Tolbukhin and Malinovsky launched their invasion of the Balkans and were able to conquer most of Romania. On September 12, 1944, two days after Malinovsky was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union, Tolbukhin was promoted to the same rank. While Malinovsky moved northwest, towards Hungary and Yugoslavia, Tolbukhin occupied Bulgaria. Starting in the Winter Campaign, Tolbukhin shifted his army to the northwest axis, thereby liberating much of Yugoslavia and invading southern Hungary.

In late April 1945, at the end of the Battle of Vienna, Tolbukhin acted on Stalin&#x27;s order to entrust Karl Renner with foundation of a new provisional Austrian government in order to prepare democratic elections. On 27 April, Renner was appointed provisional government leader, at Tolbukhin&#x27;s authority, which renders the latter an important role in the foundation of a new Austrian republic that had been integrated into the Third Reich (1938–1945). Tolbukhin gave the go-ahead at the location, for this important step towards an independent Austria in the formation of the Second Republic (1945–present).
After the war, Tolbukhin was commander-in-chief of the Southern Group of Forces, which comprised the Balkan region. In January 1947, Tolbukhin was made the commander of the Transcaucasus Military District, a post he held until his death on October 17, 1949, due to complication from diabetes.

Tolbukhin is generally regarded as one of the finest Soviet generals of World War II. Meticulous, careful, and not overly ambitious like some Soviet commanders, Tolbukhin was well respected by fellow commanders and also his men, especially since he had a dedication to keeping casualty rates low. Tolbukhin was the recipient of numerous awards and medals including the highest Soviet medal and rank, the Order of Victory and Hero of the Soviet Union, respectively. Tolbukhin was also People&#x27;s Hero of Yugoslavia, whose capital Belgrade he liberated. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, and there is a monument to him in his native Yaroslavl. The city of Dobrich in Bulgaria was renamed to Tolbukhin in his honor in 1949.

===Memorials===
The Bulgarian city of Dobrich was renamed Tolbukhin, a name it held until the fall of communism in 1989.

In Ukraine a Prospect (street) in Odesa holds his name. In December 2022 the Fyodor Tolbukhin street in Kyiv was renamed to street and the Fyodor Tolbukhin lane was renamed to Mykhailo Yalovy lane.

One of the main streets in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, was named Marshal Tolbukhin Street (in Serbian: &quot;Улица маршала Толбухина&quot; / &quot;Ulica maršala Tolbuhina&quot;). The street was originally named &quot;Макензијева&quot; / &quot;Makenzijeva&quot;, after Scottish missionary Francis Mackenzie who purchased and developed this part of the city in the late 19th century. After the fall of Communism in Serbia and democratic changes in 2000, the name of the street was reverted to its original name. Instead, &quot;Goce Delčeva&quot; Street, in the new section of the city (New Belgrade) was renamed Boulevard of Marshal Tolbukhin (&quot;Булевар маршала Толбухина&quot; / &quot;Bulevar maršala Tolbuhina&quot;) in 2016.

Budapest, the capital of Hungary also had one of its streets named after Tolbukhin, as he was one of the major Soviet commanders in the Hungarian war theatre. The previous Mészáros utca (Butchers&#x27; Street) was renamed Vámház körút (Custom House Boulevard) during the (re)construction of the area in 1875. The road was renamed after the Tsar of Bulgaria, Ferdinand in 1915, when Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the First World War. In 1919 the road got back its old name, Vámház körút, which it bore until 1942, when it was once more renamed, this time after son of Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy, István Horthy. In 1945, the road was named after Marshal Tolbukhin (Tolbuhin Boulevard), and it held this name until 1990 with the fall of communism.

A Monument to Fyodor Tolbukhin was installed in 1960 in Moscow in the square on Samotychnaya Street. The authors of the monument are the sculptor L. E. Kerbel and the architect G. A. Zakharov.

<text>The Germanic languages include some 58 (SIL estimate) languages and dialects that originated in Europe; this language family is part of the Indo-European language family. Each subfamily in this list contains subgroups and individual languages.

The standard division of Germanic is into three branches:
* East Germanic languages
* North Germanic languages
* West Germanic languages
They all descend from Proto-Germanic, and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European.

South Germanic languages, an attempt to classify some of the West Germanic languages into a separate group, is rejected by the overwhelming majority of scholars.

<text>Clayton Howard Riddell, OC (July 13, 1937 – September 15, 2018) was a Canadian billionaire businessman who was the founder, president and CEO of Paramount Resources, based in Calgary, Alberta.

==Early life==
He was born on a farm near Treherne, Manitoba on July 13, 1937, the youngest child of
Cecil Howard Riddell and Bertha Maude Riddell née Taylor. Riddell earned with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geology from the University of Manitoba.

==Career==
He was part owner of the Calgary Flames, and high-end Calgary restaurant &quot;Catch&quot;. With an estimated net worth of US$2.5 billion (as of March 2011), he was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 12th wealthiest Canadian and 459th in the world.

Riddell was a president of the Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists and chair of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

The Clayton H. Riddell Faculty of Environment, Earth, and Resources at the University of Manitoba is named in his honour. He donated $10 million to create an endowment fund for the faculty, which combines the Department of Environment and Geography, the Department of Geological Sciences and the Natural Resources Institute.

In 2008, Riddell was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his leadership and philanthropy.

In May 2010, Carleton University announced the creation of Canada&#x27;s first graduate program in political management, Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management, made possible through a donation from Riddell that is the largest in Carleton&#x27;s history.

Riddell&#x27;s $15-million donation led to significant public attention and scrutiny. The program, which aimed to provide practical training for aspiring political staffers with a cross-partisan focus, was originally proposed to Carleton University by the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, founded by former Reform Party leader Preston Manning. Manning played a prominent role in the program&#x27;s creation and chaired the program&#x27;s steering committee.

The original donor agreement allowed the Riddell Family Charitable Foundation to appoint three out of five members of a steering committee, chaired by Manning, which had significant influence over the program&#x27;s budget, hiring decisions, and curriculum. This level of donor control, coupled with Manning’s involvement, was criticized by the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) as an unprecedented infringement on academic independence. The agreement also allowed Riddell’s foundation to withhold $10-million of the pledged funds if it was unsatisfied with the program&#x27;s performance after five years.

In response to the criticism, Carleton University acknowledged that the deal did not reflect the university&#x27;s academic policies and renegotiated its terms in 2012. The revised agreement clarified that the steering committee, now described as a &quot;strategic advisory&quot; body, would no longer have the power to approve faculty hiring or curriculum changes, which would be governed solely by university policies. Manning remained on the committee in an advisory capacity under the new agreement. Despite these changes, the controversy highlighted broader concerns about the influence of private donors over public institutions in Canada, and similar concerns were raised at other Canadian universities.

==Personal life==
He was married to Vi Thorarinson, a nurse for 49 years until her death from leukemia in 2012. They had three daughters and a son together, Lynne, Sue, Jim and Brenda. Sue Riddell Rose is the CEO of Perpetual Energy.

Riddell died on September 15, 2018, after a short illness.

<text>Thomas K. McEvoy (born November 14, 1944, in Grand Rapids, Michigan) is a professional poker player, author and member of the Poker Hall of Fame, 2013 inductee. He is best known for winning the 1983 World Series of Poker Main Event.

==Early life==
McEvoy was born and raised in Michigan. He was an accountant, but after he was laid off from his job, he took up poker full-time in 1978. He first learned to play poker when he was five years old and would regularly get in trouble for playing it in grade school.

==Poker career==
McEvoy&#x27;s first cash in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) came in 1982 when he finished 6th in the $1,000 Razz event. He won his first WSOP bracelets the following year winning the $1,000 Limit Hold&#x27;em event, defeating Irish professional poker player Donnacha O&#x27;Dea heads-up to win the tournament, and later winning the 1983 WSOP Main Event. He was the first Main Event winner to earn his buy-in through a single table satellite tournament. His 7 1/2 hour long heads-up matchup with Rod Peate was the longest heads-up battle in WSOP history before being surpassed at the 2006 WSOP during the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. by Chip Reese and Andy Bloch.

Since his two bracelet wins in 1983, McEvoy has gone on to win two additional WSOP bracelets. He won the Razz tournament in 1986, defeating Alma McClelland, and a Limit Omaha tournament in 1992, defeating 1986 WSOP Main Event champion Berry Johnston. Having played in 36 WSOP Main Events, he has cashed in the Main Event three additional times since 1983 finishing 371st for $34,636 in the 2006 WSOP, 644th for $18,714 in the 2016 WSOP and 430th for $29,625 in the 2018 WSOP.

In March 2005, McEvoy won the third ever Professional Poker Tour event beating a field of pros-only at the Bay 101 casino. He defeated a final table that included fellow WSOP bracelet winners, Toto Leonidas and Hoyt Corkins.

McEvoy is staunchly opposed to smoking and in 1998, he helped organize the first tournament where smoking was not allowed. There was much reluctance, but the tournament still attracted a large number of players, and therefore confirmed the viability of having non-smoking tournaments. In 2002, McEvoy convinced Becky Binion Behnen to make the WSOP a non-smoking tournament in exchange for giving her son, Benny Behnen, poker lessons.

McEvoy has authored or co-authored over a dozen books on poker with other players such as T. J. Cloutier, Brad Daugherty, Don Vines, Linda Johnson, Dag Palovic and Max Stern. He is a former columnist for &quot;CardPlayer Magazine&quot; and was a Team Pro representative at PokerStars.com from 2003-2011.

On May 31, 2009, McEvoy won the WSOP&#x27;s first and only Champions Invitational, outlasting 19 other former Main Event champions. He defeated 2002 world champion, Robert Varkonyi in heads-up play to win the tournament. First prize was a classic 1970 Corvette and the inaugural Binion Cup, presented by Jack Binion, in honour of his father, Benny Binion, the founder of the WSOP and Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe Casino, the original home of the World Series of Poker.

As of October 2021, his total live tournament winnings are $3,087,477. His 56 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,391,462 of those winnings. Since his first WSOP cash in 1982 he has at least one WSOP cash in 30 of the last 39 years, the most recent are 2 cashes in the 2021 WSOP.

McEvoy resides in Las Vegas and has three children.

<text>Luigi Facta (16 November 1861 – 5 November 1930) was an Italian politician, lawyer and journalist and the last prime minister of Italy before the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.

==Background and earlier career==

Facta was born in Pinerolo, Piedmont, Italy. He studied law and later became a lawyer and journalist. He entered politics in 1892 when he was elected to the chamber of deputies for Pinerolo, a seat which he held for 30 years. Facta, a member of the Liberal Party, served as undersecretary of the justice and interior departments in the coalition cabinet for much of his time in Parliament. He was also the Italian Minister of Finance from 1910 until 1914 and 1920 until 1921. He served also as minister of justice from 1919 until 1920. At the outbreak of World War I, Facta supported neutrality for Italy, but then supported the war when Italy entered it. His son was killed in the war, and he said that he was proud to give a son to the fatherland.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

Facta was appointed prime minister in February 1922; leading a centre-right government. As noted by one study, Facta took office &quot;at the head of a Cabinet of definitely more right-wing tendency than the last.&quot; At the time, Italy was in political turmoil and was dealing with Mussolini&#x27;s fascist insurgency. When Mussolini decided to march on Rome, Facta reacted and wanted to declare martial law and send the army to stop Mussolini. A prerequisite for such a declaration to take effect was the monarch&#x27;s signature, which was not granted. Facta always refused to explain the secret reasons that brought King Victor Emmanuel III not to sign the declaration of emergency. The following day, Facta and his government resigned to demonstrate they did not approve of the King&#x27;s decision. The King then requested that Mussolini come to Rome to form a new government.

==Later life; death and legacy==
In 1924, King Victor Emmanuel III named Facta senator in the Italian Senate.

Facta died in Pinerolo, Italy, in 1930, with the general population believing him to have been too feeble and faithful to the King to take a more active role to stop Mussolini and the rise of Fascism.

<doc id="983690" wikidata="Q1227131" url="?curid=983690" title="Dipankara">
<text>Dipankara (Pali: &quot;Dīpaṅkara&quot;; Sanskrit: &#x27;, &quot;Lamp bearer&quot;) orDipankara Buddha is one of the Buddhas of the past. He is said to have lived on Earth four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kalpas ago. According to Buddhists, Dipankara was a previous Buddha who attained Enlightenment eons prior to Gautama Buddha, the historical Buddha.

Generally, Buddhists believe that there has been a succession of many Buddhas in the distant past and that many more will appear in the future. Dipankara was one of these previous Buddhas, while Gautama Buddha was the current and most recent Enlightened one, and Maitreya will be the next Buddha in the distant future.

Chinese Buddhism honors Dipankara as one of many Buddhas of the past. Dipankara, Gautama, and Maitreya are &quot;the Buddhas of Three Times&quot; in Yiguandao.

==Iconography==

Dipankara is generally represented as a sitting Buddha, but his depictions as a standing Buddha are common in China, Thailand, and Nepal; with the right hand he generally forms a protection mudra (&quot;abhaya mudra&quot;), and often he forms it with both hands.

Dipankara is rarely depicted alone; He is generally depicted with two bodhisattvas, Manjusri and Vajrapani (common in Java) or Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapani (common in Sri Lanka); or with the Buddhas who come after him, Gautama and Maitreya.

One of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, destroyed by the Taliban government in Afghanistan in 2001, was said to portray Dipankara. Statues of Dipankara can also be found in the Longmen and Yungang Grottoes in China.

==Prediction==
One story shown in Buddhist art has Gautama Buddha in a former incarnation known as Sumedha, a rich Brahmana turned hermit kneeling and laying his long black hair on the ground, in an act of piety that the Dipankara Buddha could cross a puddle of mud without soiling his feet.

This meeting between Dipankara and Sumedha occurred many lifetimes before Sumedha&#x27;s eventual enlightenment as Gautama Buddha (Shakyamuni). From this act, Dipankara told Sumedha &quot;In the ages of the future you will come to be a Buddha called &#x27;Shakyamuni&#x27;&quot;, to which Sumedha replied, &quot;I am to become a Buddha, awakened to enlightenment; may you tread with your feet on my hair - on my birth, old age, and death.&quot;

Dipankara then said, &quot;Freed from human existence, you will become an effective teacher, for the sake of the world. Born among the Shakyas, as the epitome of the Triple World, the Lamp of all Beings, you will be known as Gautama. You will be the son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya. Sariputta and Moggallana will be your chief disciples. Your caretaker will be named Ananda.&quot;

In the 40-plus years of his life after enlightenment, Gautama Buddha is said to have recounted almost 554 past life stories, (called Jataka tales) of his prior existences. Gautama Buddha is quoted as saying &quot;a person starts the journey to become a Buddha filling 10 Paramita&quot; or &quot;perfections&quot;. Some sources and scriptures recount that the Bodhisattva Gautama was born as Prince Sumedha in the time of Dipankara, and was rich and gave away all his wealth to become a monk. It is said that Gautama Bodhisattva received his first &quot;Niyatha Vivarana&quot;, (or definite foresighting by a Buddha) from Dipankara. This encounter, among many other predictions of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s future enlightenment, can be found in the Mahayana text &quot;Sangatha Sutra&quot;.

== Veneration ==
By the 17th century, Dipankara had become a figure of veneration in Nepalese Buddhist communities. These followers consider him a protector of merchants and associate him with alms-giving. He is also considered the protector of sailors, and sometimes statues of Dipankara are found on the coastline to guide and protect the ships in their route.

Some Chinese folk religionists in Taiwan and Chinese overseas communities also worshipped Dipankara Buddha.

The &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot; says that Dipankara achieved Nirvana in Nandarama, where a stupa was built which was thirty six yojanas high.

After suffering a small breakdown in front of her students (and then being forced to hear a neighbor play Chopin&#x27;s Étude in A Minor, &quot;Winter Wind&quot;, incessantly), Sybil Dorsett is given a neurological examination by Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, a psychiatrist. She admits to having blackouts and fears that they are getting worse. Dr. Wilbur theorizes that the incidents are a kind of hysteria, all related to a deeper problem. She asks Sybil to return at a later date for more therapy. Sybil says she will have to ask her father.

Sybil&#x27;s father, Willard Dorsett, and her stepmother, Freida, are in New York on a visit. Sybil meets them at a cafeteria for lunch. She explains to her father that the problems she used to have as a young girl have returned and that she wants to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur. Sybil&#x27;s father make it clear to Sybil that they disapprove of psychiatry. Sybil becomes upset and dissociates into Peggy, who becomes enraged and breaks a glass. Peggy angrily storms out of the cafeteria. Later that evening, Dr. Wilbur receives a late night call from someone who identifies herself as Vickie and says Sybil is about to jump out a hotel window. Dr. Wilbur rescues Sybil, who denies knowing Vickie. Suddenly, Sybil becomes hysterical and begins speaking like a young girl. This girl introduces herself as Peggy, and Wilbur realizes that Sybil is suffering from multiple personality disorder (now known as dissociative identity disorder).

Vickie introduces herself to Wilbur at the next session. Vickie, who knows everything about the other personalities, tells Wilbur about some of them, including Marcia, who is suicidal, and Vanessa, who plays the piano although Sybil has not played in years and swears she has forgotten how to play piano.

Over the weeks, each of the personalities introduces herself to Wilbur. At the same time, the personality Vanessa falls in love with a charming neighbor named Richard.

Wilbur finally explains to Sybil about the other personalities. As proof, Wilbur plays the session&#x27;s tape to allow Sybil to hear their voices, but when a voice that sounds like Sybil&#x27;s mother Hattie speaks, an infant personality named Ruthie emerges. Wilbur is unable to communicate with the pre-verbal child and must wait until Sybil returns.

Life becomes more chaotic for Sybil as the other personalities grow stronger. The personalities make Dr. Wilbur a Christmas card, but Sybil made everything purple, a color that frightens Peggy. Dr. Wilbur hypnotizes Vickie and asks about the purple. Vickie relates a memory of a time Sybil&#x27;s mother locked young Sybil in the wheat bin in the barn. Thinking she was smothering, Sybil used her purple crayon to scratch on the inside of the bin so someone would know she had been there.

Vanessa invites Richard and his son Matthew to have Christmas dinner, after which Richard spends the night in Sybil&#x27;s apartment. Sybil has a nightmare and awakens as Marcia, who tries to throw herself off the roof. Richard rescues her and calls Wilbur. Soon afterwards, Richard moves away, crushing both Sybil and Vanessa. Once again confronted with her diagnosis, Sybil attempts to convince Wilbur that she has in fact been faking all of the other personalities the entire time and denies that multiple personalities exist within her.

Wilbur goes in search of Sybil&#x27;s father, who mentions that Sybil&#x27;s mother Hattie was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia but denies that she ever abused Sybil. Wilbur also seeks out Sybil&#x27;s pediatrician. The doctor gives Wilbur a frightening account of extensive internal scarring he found while treating Sybil for a bladder problem. Finally, Wilbur visits the old Dorsett house, where she discovers the green kitchen Sybil&#x27;s selves have described many times. She also finds the purple crayon scratches inside the wheat bin. She takes them back to New York City to prove all the memories really happened.

Dr. Wilbur takes Sybil for a drive, during which Peggy reveals the horrific physical abuse she suffered at her mother&#x27;s hands. After Peggy exhausts herself, Sybil emerges, remembering everything that Peggy has just said. Finally, she is able to express her rage against her mother.

Dr. Wilbur hypnotizes Sybil to introduce her to the other personalities. Sybil, who has always been frightened of Peggy, meets her at last and is surprised that she is only a young girl. Sybil embraces a weeping Peggy. A voiceover from Dr. Wilbur explains that after this incident, Sybil recovered her memories and went on to live a full and happy life as an academic.

==The Alters==
*Peggy: A nine-year-old girl who believes she is still in the small town in which Sybil grew up. Peggy holds the rage Sybil felt at her mother&#x27;s abuse and frequently expresses her anger through temper tantrums and breaking glass. Like many of the selves, she enjoys drawing and painting. She fears hands, dishtowels, music, and the colors green and purple, all triggers to specific instances of abuse.
*Vickie: A very sophisticated and mature eighteen-year-old girl who is aware of all the other personalities and knows everything the others do, though Sybil does not. Vicky speaks French and claims to have grown up in Paris with many brothers and sisters and loving parents. The dominant personality and the only personality to undergo hypnosis.
*Vanessa: A young, vibrant, red-haired girl about twelve years old, she is outgoing and full of &quot;joie de vivre&quot;. Falls in love with Richard and helps Sybil build a relationship with him, until he moves away.
*Marcia: A young girl obsessed with thoughts of death and suicide, who tries to kill herself (and thus Sybil) on several occasions. Dresses in black.
*Ruthie: A preverbal infant. When Sybil is extremely frightened, she regresses into Ruthie and cannot move or speak.
*Mary: Named for and strongly resembles Sybil&#x27;s grandmother. When Sybil&#x27;s grandmother (the only person Sybil felt loved her) died, Sybil was so bereft that she created Mary as an internalized version of Grandma. Mary speaks in the voice of an old woman and frequently behaves as one.
*Nancy: A product of Sybil&#x27;s father&#x27;s religious fanaticism, Nancy fears the end of the world and God&#x27;s punishment.
*Clara: Around 8–9 years old. Very religious; critical and resentful of Sybil.
*Helen: Around 13–14 years old. Timid and afraid, but determined &quot;to be somebody&quot;.
*Marjorie: Around 10–11 years old. Serene and quick to laugh, enjoys parties and travel.
*Sybil Ann: Around 5–6 years old. Pale, timid, and extremely lethargic; the defeated Sybil.
*Mike: A brash young boy who likes to build and do carpentry. He builds bookshelves and a partition wall for Sybil&#x27;s apartment, frightening her badly when she doesn&#x27;t know how they got there. He and Sid both believe that they will grow a penis and be able &quot;to give a girl a baby&quot; when they&#x27;re older.
*Sid: Younger and a little more taciturn than Mike, he also enjoys building things, as well as sports. Identifies strongly with Sybil&#x27;s father and wants to be like him when he grows up.

==Production==
Sally Field stars in the title role, with Joanne Woodward playing the part of Sybil&#x27;s psychiatrist, Cornelia B. Wilbur. Woodward herself had starred in &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;, in which she portrayed a woman with three personalities, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role. Based on the book &quot;Sybil&quot; by Flora Rheta Schreiber, the movie dramatizes the life of a shy young graduate student, Sybil Dorsett (in real life, Shirley Ardell Mason), suffering from dissociative identity disorder as a result of the psychological trauma she suffered as a child. With the help of her psychiatrist, Sybil gradually recalls the severe child abuse that led to the development of 16 different personalities. Field&#x27;s portrayal of Sybil won much critical acclaim, as well as an Emmy Award.

==Edited and unedited versions==
The film, originally 198 minutes long, was initially shown over the course of two nights on NBC in 1976. Due to high public interest, the VHS version of &quot;Sybil&quot; was released in the 1980s, with one version running 122 minutes and another, extended version running 132 minutes. Several key scenes, including Sybil&#x27;s final climactic &quot;introduction&quot; to her other personalities, are missing in both versions. The film is shown frequently on television, often with scenes restored or deleted to adjust for time constraints and the varying sensitivity of viewers. The DVD includes the full 198-minute version originally displayed on the NBC broadcast.

A 128-minute edit of the film was shown in cinemas in Australia, opening in January 1978.

==Awards and nominations==
==In popular culture==

Pop rock band Tears for Fears named their album &quot;Songs From the Big Chair&quot; after the 1976 TV movie, as the title character could only prevent herself from using her different guises as defense mechanisms when she was sitting in her analyst&#x27;s &quot;big chair.&quot;

<doc id="983694" wikidata="Q4383995" url="?curid=983694" title="Touch 'n Go">
<text>Touch &#x27;n Go is a contactless smart card system used for electronic payments in Malaysia. The system was introduced in 1997 and is widely used for toll payments on highways, public transportation, parking, and other services. The card is equipped with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip that allows users to make payments by simply tapping the card on a reader device. Touch &#x27;n Go cards can be reloaded with funds either online or at designated reload kiosks. The system has become a popular and convenient way for Malaysians to make cashless transactions.

==History==
Touch &#x27;n Go was developed by Teras Teknologi Sdn Bhd while the brand and the Real Time Gross Settlement (central clearing house systems) are owned and operated by Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd, now known as Touch &#x27;n Go Sdn Bhd. The first Touch &#x27;n Go system was installed and used at Jalan Pahang Toll Plaza on 18 March 1997. It was then immediately extended to Jalan Cheras toll plaza and the East–West Link Expressway toll plaza on 15 April 1997. The Touch &#x27;N Go toll payment system was fully implemented throughout the 848 km North–South Expressway on 15 November 1998. This was made possible when the service was extended to the northern sections of the highway from Jelapang to Jitra. As such the smart card can be used to pay toll from Kempas in Johor to Jitra in Kedah, making it one of the world&#x27;s longest single stretches of expressway to have electronic toll payment systems. The official launch was at the Sungai Dua toll plaza and officiated by Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd&#x27;s then-chairman, Datuk Dr Ramli Mohamad.

The Touch &#x27;n Go system was implemented in Cityliner Sdn Bhd, a stage bus service in Klang Valley in 2000. Touch &#x27;n Go card users enjoyed discount fares of 10% when it was first introduced. Due to the need to further consolidate company operations, card users were required to pay full fare prices after 13 November 2003. However, the Touch &#x27;n Go card reader system on board buses was not well maintained by the bus operator. Card readers often malfunctioned and were not updated. Another subsidiary of Park May Berhad, City Profile Sdn Bhd, a feeder bus service (service known as Putraline) for PUTRA LRT was also introduced, and the system was successfully implemented until the Rapid KL bus revamp program took place.

The Touch &#x27;n Go facility was also embedded in the Buy N Fly loyalty card rewards program for Malaysia Airlines&#x27; retail arm, Golden Boutiques Sdn Bhd&#x27;s which was launched in December 1999. The hybrid cards are multi-function at the rewards airpoint, MEPS Cash and Touch &#x27;n Go. However, on 16 July 2002, Malaysia Airlines announced that the Buy N Fly Programme had ceased operations and consolidated its loyalty rewards into one entity, Malaysia Airlines Enrich Frequent Flyer Programme. Buy N Fly cards are no longer issued but active hybrid card users are still able to use them to perform transactions.

==Card categories==
The cards can be categorized into three types:

===Generic cards===

====Classic card====
A standard stored-value Touch &#x27;n Go card fare structure is currently available for adult fare for public transportation and standard class vehicles with two axles and three or four wheels (Class 1), excluding taxis for toll fare. It is like a top-up card.

The card is derived from several designs.

====NFC card====
The Touch &#x27;n Go card, which is enhanced with NFC technology to enable reload via the Touch &#x27;n Go eWallet, allows us to reload wherever you are and at any time. The enhanced card is currently sold via Touch &#x27;n Go eWallet at cost of RM10.00 per card.

====Identity card====
MyKad is embedded with the Touch &#x27;n Go chip since 2001.

====Co-Branded Cards====

=====PLUSMiles card=====

There is also a PLUSMiles Touch n&#x27; Go card, which is available on the North–South Expressway. The card provides a 5% rebate to users of expressways operated by PLUS (E1, E2, E3, E6, E15, E29 and E36) driving in private non-commercial vehicles.

=====MyRapid card=====
Public transportation monthly pass for Rapid KL services.

=====TESCO Clubcard=====

===Corporate cards===

====Fleet Xs card====
It is mainly used for toll fare payment. Company name, vehicle registration number and vehicle class details are printed on the card. A credit term of 30 days is given for post payment and fleet operators are able to monitor toll record/vehicle movement at highways via e-statement (itemised statement) after 24 to 48 hours from the time of transaction.

====Biz Xs card====
It is the same as the standard card, mainly for corporate users.

===Auto-reload card===

====Zing Card====
The Touch &#x27;n Go Zing Card is a companion card (works as a generic card) that is linked to Visa, MasterCard or American Express issued by participating banks in Malaysia. Each time the card balance falls below RM50, it triggers the auto-reload mechanism to reload RM100 onto the card. The amount is charged to the credit card plus RM2 as an auto-reload fee for each reload. The auto-reload function is only available on road tolls when the threshold trigger occurs; if the card is used to pay other services such as trains and car parks, it will not trigger the auto-reload. The auto-reload card cannot be manually reload value same as generic card.

Participating banks are:
* CIMB Bank
* Maybank
* Hong Leong Bank
* Bank Simpanan Nasional
* Affin Bank
* AEON Credit Service

The Zing card auto-reload facility is currently offered as a bank card.

==Card usage==
The Touch &#x27;n Go card is not only for toll fare but also parking services, public transport, theme park and cashless payment at retail outlets.

===Toll fare===
Touch &#x27;n Go can be used on entire highway stretches in Malaysia with the familiar TnG &amp; TAG sign marked on the road. Two systems were introduced for toll fare collection instead of manual tickets. Due to highways with numerous junctions or intersections serving short-distance trips, most of Malaysia&#x27;s highways use open system toll collection.

====Toll fare collection on open system====

Card users only have to touch the reader at Touch &#x27;n Go lane counters or drive-through SmartTAG lanes at certain toll plazas. Toll fares charged are fixed regardless of the distance travelled.

====Toll fare collection on closed system====
Card users &quot;touch in&quot; before entering the expressway at respective toll plazas and &quot;touch out&quot; at the exit toll plaza. Vehicle with cards have to drive thru TnG lanes and TAG lanes for SmartTAG users. Toll fares are charged based on the distance between the entry plaza and the exit plaza. Card users have to make sure the amount balance is more than RM20 before entering the toll plaza. Those with less than RM20 are required to top it up either at the offices or at TAMBAH NILAI lanes, otherwise they are unable to enter the highway. Seven expressways have the feature; the most famous is the North–South Expressway.

====SmartTAG====
An extension of Touch &#x27;n Go is the SmartTAG or TAG onboard unit, which allows users to insert the card into a reader device installed in the vehicle for fully automatic/non-stop payment at toll plazas. Payment is made automatically as the toll charge is deducted from the value stored in the Touch &#x27;n Go card.

====Electronic toll collection systems====
There are three types of the electronic toll collection (ETC) systems, Touch &#x27;n Go card unit, Smart TAG onboard unit and RFID tag. Touch &#x27;n Go and Smart TAG have been made compulsory in all expressways since 1 July 2004, following the instruction of the Works Minister, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu. Other electronic payment systems that were previously used by other highway operators such as PLUS TAG for all PLUS expressways network, Express TAG for Shah Alam Expressway, FasTrak for Damansara–Puchong Expressway and Sprint Expressway and SagaTag in Cheras–Kajang Expressway, were abolished in a move to standardise the electronic payment method.
&quot;TNG card and TNG ewallet balances are non-transferable. Therefore, road user has to take a note.&quot;

===Public transportation===
Since 2002, Touch &#x27;n Go has been chosen as the common cashless ticketing system for all rail and bus lines in Klang Valley, in parallel with co-branded Rapid KL&#x27;s &quot;My Rapid&quot; card (abolished in 2017) and KTM&#x27;s &quot;Komuterlink&quot; (not using Touch &#x27;n Go fare collection system). For all Touch &#x27;n Go logo printed cards, they are accepted at:
*KTM Komuter
**
*Rapid KL
**
**
**&quot; (future)&quot;
**
*Express Rail Link
**

as well as all Rapid KL buses and feeder buses. Touch &#x27;n Go is also accepted in Rapid Kuantan buses in Pahang, Perak Transit &quot;&quot; in Perak, and Panorama Melaka buses in Malacca.

Touch &#x27;n Go eWallet is an integrated mobile app to use the Touch ‘n Go generic card. It allows users to add the Touch &#x27;n Go generic card number to more easily track their transactions.
The usage balance in the eWallet is not interchangeable to the physical card and vice versa. However, the eWallet balance can be used if linked to the physical card to activate the PayDirect payment mechanism.

Functions available with the app for easier daily usage:
* Pay for movie tickets, concerts, and events 
* Easier transfer money between TnG eWallet
* Top up eWallet for toll usage
* Purchase of flight tickets
* Retail purchase with attached merchants
* Drive through tolls using money from the eWallet

==Criticisms==
*Add value/reload charge
:Free reload is only available as a manual transaction over the counters of Touch &#x27;n Go Hub, Highway Operation Office and selected highway toll lanes, major stations of Rapid KL and KTM Komuter. Reloading through ATM and reload agents incurs an additional fee of RM0.50 and RM1.00 at Cash Deposit machines. RM2.00 is charged for Zingcard autoreload for every RM100.

*Cheque refund
:Refunds for card balance and deposit are paid by cheque within one month and sent by post by Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd.

*No usage discount
:Concessionary users are charged between 2.0 – 2.5 percent of the profit for using the system. No discount is given, but instead card users may have to pay the commission fee. Car park operators usually pass on the Touch &#x27;n Go commission fee onto card users, resulting in users paying 10% more.

*Rebates program
:Effective 5 Oct 2009, users can claim a rebate if their usage exceeds 80 tolled transactions per month. The rebate amounts to 20% of total usage and is given in points credited to the card, not cash. It only can be claimed at the Touch &#x27;n Go counters at the toll offices.

*Effectiveness argued
:Although the system was introduced in the last 20 years with the support of the government (particularly by incorporation the system into MyKad), card and concessionary users still prefer to use cash. According to a Bank Negara report on the Payment System Act 2003, 39% of non-cash transactions in Malaysia were paid with Touch &#x27;n Go. Non-cash payment via Touch &#x27;n Go (and SmartTAG) accounted for 35% of all toll payments nationwide and 50% in the Klang Valley. However, to date, Touch &#x27;n Go claims their ten years of research and development has resulted in four million card users (in a population of 20 million) and use by all 19 toll concession companies in operation in Malaysia.

*E-statement
:All transaction records within three days of the date cannot be viewed through the e-Statement. Fax transactions recorded by phone are however available within 24 hours and mostly dependent on the data server system. There is now a site to view transactions for up to ninety days at MYTouchnGo Portal.

*Limited CTS fare structure
:The fare structure is only applicable for adults. The cards are not available for senior citizens, children, students or the handicapped; however, since 2017 RapidKL has introduced Touch &#x27;n Go concession cards for its services, replacing the previous myrapid-based cards.

*KLIA check-in
:Touch &#x27;n Go card users can no longer access the airline check-in counters at KL Sentral using their Touch &#x27;n Go card as of June 2015. The Touch &#x27;n Go card can still be used (RM55 each way) to board the KLIA Express itself, but travellers will need to check-in at KLIA instead.

*Reload via eWallet
:Despite being introduced for some time, users still need to find reload centers in order to reload their cards. The card balance is not the same with TnG eWallet and not all payment points offer PayDirect features, especially for parking.

*Lack of NFC for Visa cards
:After the introduction of the NFC card, Touch n&#x27; Go launched their very own prepaid Visa debit cards. The cards received wide criticisms as they were unable to be used to make payments at Touch n&#x27; Go terminals, particularly in parking areas. The reason for the Touch N Go feature omission was due to earlier testing showing that there were interference issues when there was both Visa PayWave and Touch N Go functions.

*Flexibility payment for toll fares
:Non-interchangeable toll fares between TnG card with ewallet system (RFID). RFID requires dedicated lanes for the closed toll system, which is different from the open toll system whereby user will be charge once at the entrance at tollgate. On the close toll system, road user require entry &amp; exit at the same RFID dedicated lanes. Otherwise, toll fare collection will be error and the users will be charged a penalty. Due to RFiD transponder does not install on all toll gate, road user have to make sure they are using the right lanes. For hybrid toll gate TnG+RFiD or SmartTAG+RFiD, priority will be taken by RFiD system if road user have RFiD sticker installed at their car. On 15 January 2022, fully migration on all PLUS highway had caused massive traffic jam due to detection issues, wrong lanes by user, low ewallet balance, total conversion on SmartTAG lane into only RFiD lanes also had cause TNG lanes becomes a massive congestion.

<doc id="983696" wikidata="Q689272" url="?curid=983696" title="Vs. System">
<text>Vs. System (short for Versus System), also written as VS System and abbreviated as VS, is a collectible card game designed by Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE). In the game, players build and play a deck of Vs. System cards in an attempt to win a game against their opponent. It was first published in 2004 and is set in the superhero genre. The game was discontinued by Upper Deck Entertainment in January 2009.

UDE announced at the 2014 Gen Con Indianapolis that they would be letting convention-goers playtest a subset of Marvel Origins reprinted as &quot;Vs. System Living Card Game&quot;. UDE then relaunched Vs. System at the 2015 Gen Con Indianapolis in its updated 2PCG format, switching from the traditional, partially-randomized card distribution model of most CCGs to a non-random, fixed-distribution model.

==Superheroic setting==

The sets of the Vs. System are based on the superheroic settings of Marvel and DC Comics, with the exception of a smaller set called the Hellboy Essential Collection. For the most part expansion sets alternated release between Marvel-based sets and DC Comics based sets with new sets every three to six months. All sets are interchangeable and compatible with each other and share the same card back. This allows players to mix characters fighting against or with each other.

Card art, characters, and gameplay concepts are inspired by their comic book appearances with the designers using what they describe as &quot;top-down design&quot;, meaning they make every attempt to develop a character&#x27;s card mechanics in keeping with how the character is represented in comic books.
Well known artists that have contributed card art include Alex Ross, John Van Fleet, Alex Garner, Jim Lee, Rachel Dodson, and Bill Sienkiewicz.

==Gameplay==

The Vs. System attempts to emulate epic superhero battles. Each player starts the game with 50 &quot;endurance points&quot;. If a player has zero or negative endurance at the end of the Recovery Phase, he or she is knocked out of the game. The Vs. System Comprehensive Rules has an in-depth explanation of every aspect of the game and is official for use in tournament judging.

===Types of cards===

There are four types of cards in the Vs. System, with color-coded frames: &quot;Character&quot; (usually red, but black for &quot;concealed&quot; characters), &quot;Equipment&quot; (gray), &quot;Location&quot; (green), and &quot;Plot Twist&quot; (blue). All four types of cards share a common layout.

===Phases of gameplay===
*Draw Phase: Each player simultaneously draws two cards from their deck.
*Build Phase: Starting with the player holding the initiative, and going clockwise, each player completes the following steps:
**&quot;Resource Step&quot;: You may place one card face down into the resource row.
**&quot;Recruit Step&quot;: Spend resource points to recruit characters and/or equipment. Resource points are determined at the beginning of the Recruit step by how many cards a player has in his or her resource row.
**&quot;Formation Step&quot;: Rearrange your characters between your front and support rows. You may also transfer &quot;Transferable&quot; equipment during this step.
::After the player with the initiative completes their steps within the Build Phase, each other player completes theirs in turn. Once each player finishes, the Build Phase ends and the Combat Phase begins.
*Combat Phase: Starting with the player holding the initiative, each player has an &quot;Attack Step&quot; where they may declare attacks with the characters they control against their opponent&#x27;s characters, or directly against an opposing player if they don&#x27;t control any non-stunned visible characters. The player with the initiative attacks with all legal attackers, or until they wish to pass. Repeat this Attack Step for each player, going clockwise, from the player with the initiative. Once each person has completed their Attack Step, the Combat Phase ends and the Recovery Phase begins
*Recovery Phase: At the end of the recovery phase, during the &quot;wrap-up&quot; portion, each player compares endurance totals, and all players with 0 or less endurance lose the game. If this would leave no players still in the game, the player with the highest endurance total wins the game. Then all players may simultaneously recover one stunned character, KO all remaining stunned characters, and ready all objects (characters, locations, equipment) they control. Once these steps are performed, the initiative passes clockwise to the next player, the Recovery Phase ends, and the next turn commences with the Draw Phase.

===Variant rules===
* Grand Melee: A regular game of Vs. System for any number of players. Last man standing wins.
* Team Alliance: A 2-on-2 game of Vs. System. Teammates sit across from each other. Plays just like grand melee, but teammates share an endurance total of 100 and cannot attack each other. Play until only one team is left.
* Two-Headed Mutant: A 2-on-2 game of Vs. System. Teammates sit next to each other across from their opponents. Each team begins the game with 100 endurance. This game variant can be played with any number of people on either team, as long as the teams are even numbered. 50 endurance is added onto the total endurance score for each person on a team. Therefore, a Three-Headed Mutant would see a game with 150 endurance.

==Card sets==
All cards are marked in the lower left with an expansion code or set code, a three-letter code identifying the set in which the card was published. The first letter of the set code indicates the setting (D for DC Comics and M for Marvel Comics), except for the Essential Collection set, which starts with the letter E.

Most Vs. System cards are released in expansion sets, of which there were a total of 18. The first 14 expansion sets all had either 165 or 220 cards, but starting with &quot;Marvel Legends&quot;, which had 273 cards, the size of expansion sets grew larger, peaking at 330 cards of the &quot;Marvel Universe&quot; set. &quot;Marvel Legends&quot; also debuted a card face layout redesign.

The game was also periodically supplemented by the release of starter deck sets, of which there were a total of 6. The starter deck sets each contained two playable 40 card mini-decks. They pitted two teams against each other, typically a &quot;hero&quot; team versus a &quot;villain&quot; team. The first 3 (&quot;X-Men vs. the Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock&quot;, and &quot;Batman vs. the Joker&quot;) drew all their cards from other expansion sets. However, the last 3 (&quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;X-Men&quot;) contained new cards not in expansions sets. Each of the last 3 starter sets also were published to coincide with an associated film also released that year (&quot;Batman Begins&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, respectively). UDE had originally planned to release a 7th starter set, for Superman (to coincide with the 2006 &quot;Superman Returns&quot; movie), but that set ended up being cancelled and never released.

Additionally, UDE planned an Essential Collections line geared towards introducing characters from outside the Marvel and DC Universes. However, only one such set ever ended up being released, the &quot;Hellboy Essential Collection&quot;. It contained two pre-constructed 60-card decks, a comprehensive rule book, and a number of other extras. Like the starter decks, the Hellboy Essential Collection is tournament-legal.

UDE also planned a Giant-Size line. However, the only set ever published in the line was &quot;The Coming of Galactus&quot;, a set geared toward multiplayer play in which multiple players would be pitted against a single powerful player taking on the role of Galactus. All cards in the set were legal for tournament play, with the exception of an oversized Galactus card and &quot;Planet&quot; cards.

Finally, there were exclusive sets, consisting of promotional cards associated with a particular expansion set released through venues such as conventions and tournaments. The exclusives sets are listed here rather than in the table below. The 5 exclusive sets (with set codes in parentheses) were:
* associated with &quot;Marvel Legends&quot;: &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; (MAA) and &quot;Marvel Exclusives&quot; (MEX)
* associated with &quot;DC Legends&quot;: &quot;DC Exclusives&quot; (DCX)
* associated with &quot;Marvel Universe&quot;: &quot;Marvel Equipment&quot; (MEQ) and &quot;Marvel Ultimates&quot; (MUL)

The following table lists all non-exclusive sets in chronological order of release:

==Organized Play==

In tournament play, there are three common formats:
* Modern Age format draws a card pool from the last two released sets from both brands (i.e., the last two Marvel sets and the last two DC Comics sets).
* Silver Age format draws a card pool from the last four released sets from both brands (i.e, the last four released sets from Marvel Comics and the last four released sets from DC Comics).
* Golden Age format draws from a card pool of all legally playable cards.

Upper Deck Entertainment planned the year-round professional $1 million Organized Play Pro Circuit prior to the release of the game.

===Banned list===
As with most TCGs, the ever-increasing card pool leads to more and more combinations and possibilities. While this is generally considered to be a positive factor, sometimes these combinations bring a degeneracy that is unhealthy for tournament play and the long term health of the game. When this occurs, organized play intervenes and the offending cards are usually banned. The first card to be banned was &quot;Overload&quot; banned because of its synergy with various attackpumps. Used in tandem, players were able to stun their opponent&#x27;s board at minimal cost. UDE later released a fixed—playable but unremarkable—version of the card called System Failure, released in MAV.

Unlike most CCGs which have banned lists unique to various formats, UDE has chosen to have one universal all-encompassing banned list.

==Video game==
A video game based on the Vs. System was released on February 27, 2007 for the PC, PSP and Nintendo DS. It was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by Konami. The game has been named as the &quot;Marvel Trading Card game&quot; and only includes cards from &quot;Marvel Origins&quot; and Marvel-based expansions up to the Avengers set.

==Awards==
In 2004, Vs. System won the &quot;Gamers&#x27; Choice Award&quot; and was also nominated for &quot;Best Collectible Card Game or Expansion&quot; both from Origins Awards. In 2005 it received the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award from InQuest Gamer.

<doc id="983703" wikidata="Q809242" url="?curid=983703" title="Bartels (crater)">
<text>Bartels is a lunar impact crater located along the western perimeter of the Moon&#x27;s visible face. At this location the crater is viewed from the side, and visibility is affected by libration. The crater can be viewed in its entirety only from lunar orbit. It is located to the north of the crater Moseley and south-southeast of Voskresenskiy.

The rim of this crater is worn and eroded, particularly along the southern face and in the northeast where a small crater overlies the rim. The interior floor forms a nearly plain except for a tiny central peak offset to the west of the midpoint, and is marked by a number of tiny craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bartels.

<doc id="983708" wikidata="Q509701" url="?curid=983708" title="Irving Allen">
<text>Irving Allen (born Irving Applebaum, November 24, 1905 – December 17, 1987) was an Austro-Hungarian–born American theatrical and cinematic producer and director.

He received an Academy Award in 1948 for producing the short movie &quot;Climbing the Matterhorn&quot;. In the early 1950s, he formed Warwick Films with partner Albert &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli and relocated to England to leverage film making against a subsidy offered by the British government. Through the 1950s, they each became known as one of the best independent film producers of the day, as the two men would sometimes work in tandem, but more often than not on independent projects for their joint enterprise producing multiple projects in a given year.

==Biography==
Born in Lemberg (Austro-Hungary), Allen entered the film industry as an editor at Universal, Paramount and Republic in 1929. During the 1940s, he made a sequence of shorts, including the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Forty Boys and a Song&quot; (1941), which he directed. His short films often won more acclaim than his low-budget features. In the late 1940s, Allen started concentrating more fully on being a producer.

===Warwick Films===
In the early 1950s, he led Warwick Films as the &#x27;name producer&#x27;, making films in both the US and England, with Albert R. Broccoli something of a junior partner. In 1957–1958, his partnership with Broccoli was strained both by Broccoli&#x27;s family health crises (his second wife became terminally ill, soon after adopting one child and with a newborn) and to a lesser extent their disagreement over the film potential of the James Bond novel series. Broccoli was very interested, believing the novels could lead to a high quality series of films, and Allen was not, eschewing the potential of Broccoli&#x27;s vision of Bond in favor of older established forms. The partners met with Bond author Ian Fleming separately in 1957, Cubby from New York where he&#x27;d retreated to care for his wife, but in the London meeting with Fleming arranged by Broccoli, Allen all but insulted Fleming, declaring that Fleming&#x27;s novels weren&#x27;t even &quot;good enough for television&quot;. Broccoli mired in his troubles in New York, only knew that no deal had occurred until pre-production meetings with Fleming which resulted in the decision to make the &quot;Dr. No&quot;, as the first film project by Eon Productions.

In 1959, captivated by the historical importance and a good script Warwick undertook the risky project of producing, funding, and distributing &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot;, which was released in 1960. Ahead of the times, its frank unprejudiced depiction of homosexual issues ran into a ratings stone wall in the United States all but preventing any sort of advertising, and the company lost its large investment, Broccoli and Allen fell out, and the partnership became moribund, being dissolved officially in a 1961 bankruptcy liquidation.

Thus the two partners each turned into solo producers in late 1960. Broccoli went on to found Danjaq, S.A. and Eon Productions with Harry Saltzman beginning the Bond films on a shoestring budget, and Allen occupied himself with other projects.

===Matt Helm===
Some years later, Allen cast about for his own spy series. He acquired the rights to Donald Hamilton&#x27;s Matt Helm series. Allen was responsible for the Matt Helm series, &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966), &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot; (1966), &quot;The Ambushers&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1969).

In July 1967, Allen said &quot;At this stage I&quot;m only interested in making money. I&#x27;m not interested in kudos or getting good reviews - I&#x27;ve had all that. I&#x27;m just concerned with getting the greatest number of people into theatres.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve done practically everything,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s no place I haven&#x27;t been in the business. The only thing I can&#x27;t do is write.&quot;

Allen&#x27;s Helm series had one major effect on Broccoli&#x27;s Bond movies (produced at the time in partnership with Harry Saltzman). To get Dean Martin on board as Matt Helm, Allen had to make the actor a partner in the enterprise. Dean Martin ended up making more money on &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966) than Sean Connery made on &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). This did not go unnoticed by Connery.

Allen was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood, California.

<doc id="983717" wikidata="Q4926190" url="?curid=983717" title="Bless Me, Ultima">
<text>Bless Me, Ultima is a coming-of-age novel by Rudolfo Anaya centering on Antonio Márez y Luna and his mentorship under his &quot;curandera&quot; and protector, Ultima. It has become the most widely read and critically acclaimed novel in the New Mexican literature canon since its first publication in 1972. Teachers across disciplines in middle schools, high schools and universities have adopted it as a way to implement multicultural literature in their classes. The novel reflects Hispano culture of the 1940s in rural New Mexico. Anaya&#x27;s use of Spanish, mystical depiction of the New Mexican landscape, use of cultural motifs such as &quot;La Llorona&quot;, and recounting of &quot;curandera&quot; folkways such as the gathering of medicinal herbs, gives readers a sense of the influence of indigenous cultural ways that are both authentic and distinct from the mainstream.

The ways in which the novel provides insight into the religiosity of Chicano culture were first explored in 1982 in an essay titled &quot;A Perspective for a Study of Religious Dimensions in Chicano Experience: &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; as a Religious Text&quot;, written by Mexican American historian of religion David Carrasco. This essay was the first scholarly text to explore how the novel alludes to the power of sacred landscapes and sacred humans.

&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; is Anaya&#x27;s best known work and was awarded the prestigious Premio Quinto Sol. In 2008, it was one of 12 classic American novels selected for The Big Read, a community-reading program sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, and in 2009, it was the selected novel of the United States Academic Decathlon.

&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; is the first in a trilogy that continued with the publication of &quot;Heart of Aztlan&quot; (1976) and &quot;Tortuga&quot; (1979). With the publication of his novel &quot;Alburquerque&quot; (1992), Anaya was proclaimed a front-runner by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in &quot;what is better called not the new multicultural writing, but the new American writing.&quot;

Owing to what some consider adult language, violent content, and sexual references, &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; is often the target of attempts to restrict access to the book and was therefore placed on the list of most commonly challenged books in the U.S. in 2013. However, in the last third of the twentieth century, the novel has initiated respect for New Mexican, indigenous, and Chicano literature as an important and nonderivative type of American literature among academics.

==Creation and purpose as an autobiography==

Bringing &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; to fruition took Anaya six years and an additional two years to find a publisher. From 1965 to 1971, Anaya struggled to find his own &quot;voice&quot; as the literary models he knew and had studied at the University of New Mexico (BA English, 1963) did not fit him as a writer. He has also remarked on the unavailability of many authors at that time who could serve as mentors for his life experience as a Chicano. Anaya says that the great breakthrough in finding his voice as a writer occurred in an evening when he was writing late at night. He was struggling to find a way to get the novel to come together and then:
This was the epiphany that Anaya believes came from his subconscious to provide him a mentor and his spiritual guide to the world of his Native American experience (115).

In Anaya&#x27;s first novel, his life becomes the model for expressing the complex process of growing up Chicano in the American Southwest. Michael Fink characterizes Anaya&#x27;s work as &quot;the search for a sense of place.&quot; And the author tells us, &quot;&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; takes place in a small town in eastern New Mexico and it is really the setting of my home town Santa Rosa, New Mexico. Many of the characters that appear are my childhood friends.&quot;

The autobiographical relationship between Anaya and his first novel best begins through the author&#x27;s own words as he reflects on his life&#x27;s work as an artist and as a Chicano:

Anaya&#x27;s authenticity to speak about the Chicano worldview is grounded in the history of his family. He is a descendant from the &quot;Hispanos&quot;, who originally settled the land grant in Albuquerque called &quot;La Merced de Atrisco&quot; in the Rio Grande Valley (2). Anaya chooses Maria Luna de Márez as the name of Antonio&#x27;s mother, which parallels his own mother&#x27;s surname, and her cultural and geographical origins: Rafaelita Mares, the daughter of farmers from a small village near Santa Rosa called Puerto De Luna. In additional ways Anaya&#x27;s family and that of his young protagonist parallel: Both Rafaelita&#x27;s first and second husbands were &quot;vaqueros&quot; (cowboys) who preferred life riding horses, herding cattle and roaming the &quot;llano,&quot; as did Antonio&#x27;s father, Gabriel. Anaya&#x27;s family also included two older brothers who left to fight WWII and four sisters. Thus, Anaya grew up in a family constellation similar to that of his young protagonist. Anaya&#x27;s life and that of Antonio parallel in other ways that ground the conflict with which his young protagonist struggles in advancing to adolescence. As a small child Anaya moved with his family from Las Pasturas, his relatively isolated birthplace on the &quot;llano&quot; to Santa Rosa, a &quot;city&quot; by New Mexico standards of the time. This move plays a large part in the first chapter of Anaya&#x27;s first novel as it sets the stage for Antonio&#x27;s father&#x27;s great disappointment in losing the lifestyle of the &quot;llano&quot; that he loved so well, and perhaps the kindling of his dream to embark on a new adventure to move with his sons to California—a dream that never would be.

==Historical context==

&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; focuses on a young boy&#x27;s spiritual transformation amidst cultural and societal changes in the American Southwest during World War II. Anaya&#x27;s work aims to reflect the uniqueness of the Hispano experience in the context of modernization in New Mexico—a place bearing the memory of European and indigenous cultures in contact spanning nearly half a millennium. The relationship between Anaya&#x27;s protagonist, Antonio, and his spiritual guide, Ultima, unfolds in an enchanted landscape that accommodates cultural, religious, moral and epistemological contradictions: Márez vs. Luna, the Golden Carp vs. the Christian God, good vs. evil, Ultima&#x27;s way of knowing vs. the Church&#x27;s or the school&#x27;s way of knowing.

Cynthia Darche Park, a professor at San Diego State University, claims &quot;These contradictions reflect political conquest and colonization that in the first instance put the Hispano-European ways of thinking, believing, and doing in the power position relative to those of the indigenous peoples.&quot; (188) New Mexico experienced a second wave of European influence—this time English speaking—which was definitively marked by U.S. victory in the war between the United States and Mexico that ended with The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. According to Richard Griswold del Castillo, &quot;The treaty established a pattern of political and military inequality between the two countries, and this lopsided relationship has stalked Mexican-U.S relations ever since.&quot;

&quot;Hispanos&quot; emigrated from Central New Spain to what was then one of the outermost frontiers of New Spain after Coronado in 1540 led 1100 men and 1600 pack and food animals northward in search of the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola.

Thereafter, the Spanish built permanent communities for the Indians along the Rio Grande and introduced domesticated animals to the area, all while striving for religious conversion of the native communities. The Spanish subjugated the native people to build mission churches in each of the new villages, but the Pueblo Indians finally rebelled in 1680 and drove the Spanish out of their land.

In 1692, the Spanish, led by Don Diego de Vargas, reconquered New Mexico. This time colonizers were able to coexist with the Pueblo Indians. The Spanish established many communities in which Catholicism and the Spanish language combined with the culture and myths of the Pueblo Indians. New Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821 and eventually achieved independent statehood in the United States of America in 1912. The mixed cultural influences and a long history of intermarriage among the Hispanos and the indigenous peoples (i.e., the &quot;mestizaje&quot;) remained largely intact throughout rural New Mexico well into the 20th century. The colonization of New Mexico by Spanish colonists resulted, therefore, in a combination of indigenous myths with Catholicism. As the Hispano community&#x27;s beliefs and ways of doing things interacted with those of the Native Americans, a cultural pattern evolved in which indigenous myth maintained importance alongside Catholic doctrine.

As modernization spread across the United States with completion of the transcontinental railway in the 1860s and establishment of the Rural Electrification Administration in the 1930s, isolated rural communities were changed forever. The Second World War in the 1940s also wrought change as young men were sent to far off places and returned to their homeland bearing the vestiges of violent, traumatic experiences and exposure to a cosmopolitan world.

Because of the horrors that Antonio&#x27;s brothers experienced in the war, none of them are able to integrate themselves back into the quiet life of Guadalupe; Antonio describes them as “dying giants” because they can no longer cope with the life that they left behind when they went to war. Their decision to leave Guadalupe is indirectly linked to their experiences in the war. The impact of modernization and war, therefore, did not exclude the Hispanos and indigenous peoples of New Mexico as the boundaries of their previously insular communities were crossed by these external technological and cultural influences.

Anaya dramatizes the pressures of change in the New Mexican peoples&#x27; response to the detonation of the first atomic test bomb near Alamogordo, New Mexico July 16, 1945 as apocalyptic:

Tonn reminds us that both the narrated time and the moment of the novel&#x27;s first appearance were periods of transition. The United States in the decades of the 1960s and 70&#x27;s underwent a series of deep societal changes which some scholars deem to have been as apocalyptic to U.S. society as the detonation of the Atomic bomb was to the New Mexican peoples in 1945. Berger (2000:388), cited in Keyword:Apocalypse, outlines two additional areas of post war apocalyptic representation after (1) nuclear war, and (2) the Holocaust. They are (3) apocalypses of liberation (feminist, African American, postcolonial) and (4) what is loosely called &quot;postmodernity&quot;.

Anaya&#x27;s writing of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; coincided with one of the principal upheavals of the move toward liberation, the Civil Rights Movement including the Chicano farm labor movement led by Cesar Chavez. Tonn points out that events surrounding the struggle for civil rights, the Vietnam War, the assassination of John F. Kennedy and later of Martin Luther King Jr., urban disturbances such as Watts and Detroit posed deep-seated &quot;challenges to the dominant self-image of United States Society…&quot; &quot;…leading to fundamental shifts in societal values and mores.&quot;

Tonn and Robert Cantú challenge the received consensus on the purpose of the novel and its relation to its past historical reality.

==Plot summary==
Set in the small town of Guadalupe, New Mexico, just after World War II, Antonio Márez y Luna (Tony) tells his story from the memories of his adult self, who reflects on his growing up. The novel opens as the protagonist, Antonio, approaches the age of seven when his family decides to house Ultima, an elderly curandera. Ultima, known as “La Grande” in the Márez household, embodies the wisdom of her ancestors and carries the powers to heal, to confront evil, knowledge of how to use the power of nature and the ability to understand the relationship between the living and the spirits. Tony&#x27;s parents both hold conflicting views about Tony&#x27;s destiny and battle over his future path. In the first chapter Anaya establishes the roots of this struggle through Tony&#x27;s dream—a flashback to the day of his birth. In his dream, Tony views the differences between his parents&#x27; familial backgrounds. His father&#x27;s side, the Márez (descendants of the sea), are the restless &quot;vaqueros&quot; who roam the &quot;llanos&quot; and seek adventure. The Lunas, his mother&#x27;s side, are the people of the moon, religious farmers whose destiny is to homestead and work the land. Each side of the family wants control of the newborn&#x27;s future. His mother&#x27;s dream is for him to become a Roman Catholic priest, his father&#x27;s dream is to embark on a new adventure and move west to California with his sons to recapture the openness of the &quot;Llano&quot; he has foregone in moving to the town. As the two families argue over Antonio&#x27;s destiny, Ultima, serving as the midwife, declares, “Only I will know his destiny.”

Following an immediate bond with Ultima, Antonio learns of the many herbs and barks, which she uses in her ceremonies. Tony&#x27;s progress in learning about life is grounded in Ultima, who is highly respected by his parents. However, one night Antonio witnesses the death of a man back from the war, which makes him question his religion and identity, and sparks his journey towards manhood. Antonio begins school in the fall, where he is portrayed as an excellent student, which greatly pleases his mother.

Tony&#x27;s First Communion experience leaves him disillusioned as he did not receive the spiritual knowledge he had expected. He begins to question the value of the Catholic Church, concentrated on the Virgin Mary and a Father God, and on ritual, as unable to answer his moral and metaphysical dilemmas. At the same time, realizing that the Church represents the female values of his mother, Tony cannot bring himself to accept the lawlessness, violence and unthinking sensuality which his father and older brothers symbolize. Instead through his relationship with Ultima, he discovers a oneness with nature. Through his discovery that &quot;All is One&quot; he is able to resolve the major existential conflict in his life. One day, while socializing with his friends they tell him the story of the Golden Carp. Antonio also continues to be an example for the children, who praise his religious savant as they dress him as a priest while preparing for first communion. Antonio&#x27;s admiration for Ultima strengthens as he continues to question his faith, hoping to understand once he takes communion for the first time.

When Antonio&#x27;s Uncle Lucas falls ill, presumably due to a curse by Tenorio&#x27;s three evil daughters, Antonio must come to grips with the opposition between good and evil. Ultima, in her role as protector, uses her knowledge of healing and magic to neutralize the evil witchcraft and, despite lacking priestly recognition, emerges as the only one who can save him from death.

In another traumatic death, Antonio witnesses the murder of Narciso, known as the town drunk, by Tenorio, a malicious saloon-keeper and barber in El Puerto. As a result, Antonio becomes ill and enters a dream-like state. Tenorio blames Ultima for the death of one of his daughters, claiming that his daughter passed because Ultima cursed her. Tenorio plots his revenge on Ultima throughout the duration of the novel.

The determined Tenorio emerges in the final scenes as he chases Antonio back to the Màrez house, where Tenorio shoots Ultima&#x27;s owl. Following the death of the owl, Ultima quickly follows and is accompanied by Antonio at her bedside as she dies. Before her death, she instructs Antonio to collect her medicines and herbs before destroying them by the river.

At the conclusion of the novel, Antonio reflects on the tension that he feels as he is pulled between his father&#x27;s free, open landscape of the &quot;llano&quot;, and his mother&#x27;s circumscribed river valley of the town. In addition, he reflects on the pull between Catholicism and the continuation of Ultima&#x27;s spiritual legacy and concludes that he does not need to choose one over the other, but can bring both together to form a new identity and a new religion that is made up of both. Antonio says to his father:
===Characters===

Antonio Juan Márez y Luna – Antonio is seven and serious, thoughtful, and prone to moral questioning, and his experiences force him to confront difficult issues that blur the lines between right and wrong. He turns to both pagan and Christian ideologies for guidance, but he doubts both traditions. With Ultima&#x27;s help, Antonio makes the transition from childhood to adolescence and begins to make his own choices and to accept responsibility for their consequences.

Gabriel Márez and Maria Luna – Tony&#x27;s parents. Both hold conflicting views about Tony&#x27;s destiny and battle over his future path. While Gabriel represents the roaming life of a vaquero and hopes for Tony to follow this path of life, Maria represents the settled life of hard-working farmers and aspires for her son to become a priest.

Ultima – An elderly &quot;curandera&quot;, known in the Márez household as &quot;La Grande&quot; is the embodiment of the wisdom of her ancestors and carries within her the powers to heal, to confront evil, to use the power of nature and to understand the relationship between the seen and unseen. Her role in the community is as mediator. &quot;She preserves the indispensable contact with the world of nature and the supernatural forces inhabiting this universe (255).&quot; She is the spiritual guide for Antonio as he journeys through childhood. Ultima knows the ways of the Catholic Church and also the ways of the indigenous spiritual practices over which she is master. Ultima understands the philosophy and the morality of the ancient peoples of New Mexico and teaches Tony through example, experience and critical reflection, the universal principles that explain and sustain life. Although she is generally respected in the community, people sometimes misunderstand her power. At times she is referred to as a &quot;bruja&quot;, or witch, but no one—not even Antonio—knows whether or not she is truly a witch. Finally Antonio puts pieces of the puzzle together and the revelation of who she is comes to him. She holds Antonio&#x27;s destiny in her hands, and at the end of the story sacrifices her own life so that Antonio might live.

Tenorio Trementina and his three daughters – Tenorio is a malicious saloon-keeper and barber in El Puerto. His three daughters perform a black mass and place a curse on Antonio&#x27;s uncle Lucas Luna. Tenorio detests Ultima because she lifts the curse on Lucas and soon after she does so, one of Tenorio&#x27;s daughters dies. Hot-tempered and vengeful, Tenorio spends the rest of the novel plotting Ultima&#x27;s death, which he finally achieves by killing her owl familiar, her spiritual guardian. Afterwards, he tries to kill Antonio but is shot by Uncle Pedro.

Ultima&#x27;s Owl – Embodies Ultima&#x27;s soul, the power of her mysticism, and her life force. The song the owl sings softly outside Antonio&#x27;s window at night indicates Ultima&#x27;s presence and magical protection in Antonio&#x27;s life. Ultima&#x27;s owl scratches Tenorio&#x27;s eye out as he stands in Gabriel&#x27;s doorway and demands the right to take Ultima away from Gabriel&#x27;s house. By the end of the novel Tenorio has figured out the connection between Ultima and her owl. By killing Ultima&#x27;s owl, Tenorio destroys Ultima&#x27;s soul and life force, which leads quickly to her death. Antonio takes on the responsibility of burying the owl and realizes that he is really burying Ultima.

Lupito – A war veteran who has post-traumatic stress disorder. After Lupito murders the local sheriff in one of his deranged moments, he is killed by the sheriff and his posse as young Antonio looks on from his hiding place on the banks of the river. Lupito&#x27;s violent death provides the catalyst for Antonio&#x27;s serious moral and religious questioning.

&quot;Lucas Luna&quot; – Antonio&#x27;s uncle, who gets cursed by the Trementina sisters when he tries to stop them from practicing black magic. As a result, he gets so sick that Ultima is summoned to cure him. She concocts a potion of herbs, water, and kerosene as a purgative and uses Antonio&#x27;s innocence as a mediator to effect the cure.

Narciso – Although known as the town drunk, Narciso cuts a large, strong figure of a man. Narciso and Gabriel are good friends because they share a deep and passionate love for the &quot;llano&quot;. Narciso has a deep abiding loyalty and love for Ultima because of her extraordinary efforts to save his young wife who had succumbed to an epidemic that struck the town. Narciso demonstrates a strong appreciation for the richness of the earth —his garden is a lush masterpiece full of sweet vegetables and fruits. Tenorio kills him as he is on his way to warn Ultima that Tenorio is after her. As he lies dying in Antonio&#x27;s arms, he asks Antonio to give him a blessing.

Téllez – One of Gabriel&#x27;s friends. He challenges Tenorio when Tenorio speaks badly of Ultima. Not long afterward, a curse is laid on his home. Ultima agrees to lift the curse, explaining that Téllez&#x27;s grandfather once hanged three Comanche Indians for raiding his flocks. Ultima performs a Comanche funeral ceremony on Téllez&#x27;s land, and ghosts cease to haunt his home.

Antonio&#x27;s friends: Abel, Bones, Ernie, Horse, Lloyd, Red, and the Vitamin Kid – An exuberant group of boys who frequently curse and fight. Horse loves to wrestle, but everyone fears Bones more because he is reckless and perhaps even crazy. Ernie is a braggart who frequently teases Antonio. The Vitamin Kid is the fastest runner in Guadalupe. Red is a Protestant, so he is often teased by the other boys. Lloyd enjoys reminding everyone that they can be sued for even the most minor offenses. Abel, the smallest boy in the group, frequently urinates in inappropriate places.

Samuel – One of Antonio&#x27;s friends. He is also the Vitamin Kid&#x27;s brother. Unlike most of Antonio&#x27;s friends, Samuel is gentle and quiet. He tells Antonio about the golden carp. It is here that Antonio starts questioning his faith.

Florence – One of Antonio&#x27;s friends who does not believe in God, but goes to catechism to be with his friends. Florence shows Antonio that the Catholic Church is not perfect. He dies in a very bad drowning accident.

Jasón Chávez – One of Antonio&#x27;s friends. He disobeys his father when he continues to visit an Indian who lives near the town. He is described by Antonio as being moody.

Jasón Chávez&#x27;s Indian – A friend of Jasón&#x27;s who is disliked by Jasón&#x27;s father. Cico tells Antonio that the story of the golden carp originally comes from the Indian.

Andrew, Eugene, and León Márez – Antonio&#x27;s brothers. For most of Antonio&#x27;s childhood, his brothers are fighting in World War II. When they return home, they suffer post-traumatic stress as a result of the war. Restless and depressed, they all eventually leave home to pursue independent lives, crushing Gabriel&#x27;s dream of moving his family to California.

Deborah and Theresa Márez – Antonio&#x27;s older sisters. Most of the time, they play with dolls and speak English, a language Antonio does not begin to learn until he attends school.

Antonio&#x27;s uncles – Juan, Lucas, Mateo, and Pedro Luna – María&#x27;s brothers are farmers. They struggle with Gabriel to lay a claim to Antonio&#x27;s future. They want him to become a farmer or a priest, but Gabriel wants Antonio to be a &quot;vaquero&quot; in the Márez tradition. Antonio&#x27;s uncles are quiet and gentle, and they plant their crops by the cycle of the moon.

Father Byrnes – A stern Catholic priest with hypocritical and unfair policies. He teaches catechism to Antonio and his friends. He punishes Florence for the smallest offenses because Florence challenges the Catholic orthodoxy, but he fails to notice, and perhaps even ignores, the misbehavior of the other boys. Rather than teach the children to understand God, he teaches them to fear God.

Chávez – Chávez is the father of Antonio&#x27;s friend Jasón. Distraught and vengeful, he leads a mob to find Lupito after Lupito kills Chávez&#x27;s brother, the local sheriff. He forbids Jasón to visit an Indian who lives near the town, but Jasón disobeys him.

Prudencio Luna – The father of María and her brothers. He is a quiet man who prefers not to become involved in other peoples’ conflicts. When Tenorio declares an all out war against Ultima, he does not want his sons to get involved, even though Ultima saved Lucas&#x27;s life.

Miss Maestas – Antonio&#x27;s first-grade teacher. Although Antonio does not speak English well, Miss Maestas recognizes his bright spark of intelligence. Under her tutelage, Antonio unlocks the secrets of words. She promotes him to the third grade at the end of the year.

Miss Violet – Antonio&#x27;s third grade teacher. He, with Abel, Bones, Ernie, Horse, Lloyd, Red, and the Vitamin Kid, set up a play about the First Christmas on a dark and snowy night, which turns into a hilarious disaster because of the ever crazy Bones.

Rosie – The woman who runs the local brothel. Antonio has a deep fear of the brothel because it represents sin. He is devastated when he finds out that his brother Andrew frequently goes to it.

The flying man – This man was Ultima&#x27;s teacher and was also known as &quot;el hombre volador&quot;. He gave her the owl that became her spirit familiar, her guardian, and her soul. He told her to do good works with her powers, but to avoid interfering with a person&#x27;s destiny. The invocation of his name inspires awe and respect among the people who have heard about his legendary powers and incites fear in Tenorio Trementina.

== Literary interpretations ==

=== Development of an &quot;American Mestizaje&quot;, Antonio&#x27;s boon ===
After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the state officially constructed a Mexican national identity policy on the proposition that Mexicans are the product of a creative mixing of Indians and Europeans—that is, about a fusing together of cultures. This doctrine is expressed in official rhetoric, mythology and public ceremonial. In practice, however, the emphasis on culture gets conflated with the biological mixing of races, &quot;mestizaje&quot; in Spanish. The Revolution&#x27;s goals included returning to Mexico&#x27;s indigenous peoples their dignity as full-fledged citizens by relieving them from a history of exploitation, providing them with material progress and social justice. In return for this, Mexican Indians would give up their old customs, speak Spanish and join the mainstream of national life, defined as &quot;mestizo&quot;, the biological issue of mixed-race parentage. Thus, the Mexican &quot;Mestizaje&quot; has come to represent a policy of cultural assimilation.

A number of Anaya critics and at least one Chicana novelist view his young protagonist&#x27;s path to adolescence as a spiritual search for a personal identity. The result embodies the synergistic integration of both the cultural and biological aspects of his indigenous and European inheritances as the creation of something new.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicano/acomposite&quot;&gt;Kelly, Margot.(1997). A minor revolution: Chicano/a composite novels and the limits of genre. In Julie Brown (Ed.),&quot;Ethnicity and the American Short Story&quot;. (pp. 63–84). Garland Publishing, Inc.: New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio&#x27;s successful quest provides the world with a new model of cultural identity —a new American &quot;Mestizaje&quot; for the &quot;American Mestizo&quot; known as the &quot;Chicano&quot;. This model repudiates assimilation to the mainstream culture, but embraces acceptance of our historical selves through creative adaptation to the changing world around us.

Margarite Fernandez Olmos comments on the novel&#x27;s pioneering position in the Chicano literary tradition: &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; blazed a path within the Chicano literary tradition in the [genre] &#x27;novels of identity&#x27; in which the main characters must redefine themselves within the larger society from the vantage point of their own distinct ethnicity.&quot; (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (&quot;Face of an Angel&quot;, 1994) support Olmos&#x27; position. In an interview with Margot Kelly, Chavez concludes, &quot;Anaya maintains that the kind of protagonist who will be able to become free is a person of synthesis, a person who is able to draw . . . on our Spanish roots and our native indigenous roots and become a new person, become that Mestizo with a unique perspective.&quot; In general, Amy Barrias&#x27; analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery. (16)

Michael Fink uses a wider lens to suggest that Anaya&#x27;s seminal novel is a contribution to identity and memory politics that provides us with &quot;a set of strategies of transcultural survival . . . [in which] former collective identities are eventually transformed into new hybrid identities of difference.&quot; (6–7)

Anaya uses strategies that employ the need for a mentor, and the return to ancient spiritual roots encompassing belief in magic, mysticism, and the shaman&#x27;s trance. Fernandez Olmos remarks on mentorship: &quot;In &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; the figure of Ultima . . . is crucial. As young Antonio&#x27;s guide and mentor, her teachings not only bring him into contact with a mystical, primordial world but also with a culture—his own Hispanic/Indian culture—that he must learn to appreciate if he is ever to truly understand himself and his place within society.&quot; (17) Amy Barrias cites the novel as a prime example of the use of magical intervention as the mediator, which enables Antonio to &quot;emerge from his conflicts with a blended sense of identity. [He takes] the best each culture has to offer to form a new perspective.&quot;(iv)

Cynthia Darche Park focuses on the shaman&#x27;s initiation as the spiritual experience that allows Antonio&#x27;s transcendental integration of the conflicts with which he is struggling: 

===Anaya as mythmaker: apocalypse as revelation, the hero&#x27;s journey===

– Paul Ricoeur

Robert Cantú suggests that apocalypse as revelation is the ideological construct that best explains the novel&#x27;s structure and purpose. His reconstructive analysis shows how Antonio, as narrator, solves and resolves his troubling metaphysical questions through a series of revelations mediated by Ultima and her otherworldly connections. As more and more is revealed to Tony, a transcendent reality is disclosed which is both temporal, insofar as it envisages eschatological salvation; and spatial, insofar as it involves another, supernatural world.

An ideology is a set of ideas that constitute one&#x27;s goals, expectations, and actions. An ideology can be thought of as a comprehensive vision, as a way of looking at things (compare worldview), as in several philosophical tendencies (see Political ideologies), or a set of ideas proposed by the dominant class of a society to all members of this society (a &quot;received consciousness&quot; or product of socialization).

===Myth and magic as healing===
Because healing is Ultima&#x27;s mission, Antonio&#x27;s relationship with her includes accompanying her to gather the curative herbs she knows about through tradition and spiritual revelation. With her Antonio visits the sick and begins to grasp a connection between healing and nature even though he never receives an explicit scientific or grounded explanation for how she foretells future occurrences, heals the infirm, combats witches through casting spells, or when and why she decides not to intervene. Ultima&#x27;s indigenous and experiential pedagogy allows Antonio to intuit that her approach to healing includes a sense of who the afflicted person is, what s/he believes, knowledge of the healing powers of her herbs, and the limits of her power. He learns through assisting Ultima in the cure of his uncle that healing requires making himself vulnerable to sickness and to the spiritual as well as physical needs of the sick. With Antonio, Ultima&#x27;s relationship as healer is also one of teacher. Cynthia Park considers the relationship between those two roles, and abstracts a set of life-giving principles that form the basis for Ultima&#x27;s way of knowing.

=== Connections to multicultural literature ===
Susan Landt proposes that multicultural literature will take a wide range of perspectives from individuals within historically marginalized groups.

Heriberto Gordina, a teacher at the University of Iowa, and Rachelle McCoy, a teacher at West Branch High School in West Branch, Iowa, analyze the novel in two different perspectives of multicultural literature. An emic perspective takes a view of a culture within its elements whereas an etic perspective takes an objective view of culture. For the two teachers, the story takes an emic perspective as Antonio, living within a Chicano culture, must find his own identity as he analyzes and questions his own connections to the culture&#x27;s various ideologies, cultures, and viewpoints throughout the narrative.

Candace Morales, a graduate student pursuing a Masters of Science in Education while concentrating in Reading, proposes that in a curriculum that utilizes Bless Me Ultima as a piece of multicultural literature, it must be timed appropriately. Specifically, she suggests teaching it to middle schoolers so that they have a diverse lens (that of a Chicano/a culture) to view their own development; to Morales, Antonio&#x27;s own pursuit of “knowledge, truth, and personal identity” will resonate with the students as well.

==Reception and legacy==

, &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; has become the best-selling Chicano novel of all time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reports that Anaya is the most widely read author in Hispanic communities, and sales of his classic, &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; (1972) have surpassed 360,000.

After Quinto Sol&#x27;s initial publication of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; in 1972, critics by and large responded enthusiastically. The general consensus was that the novel provided Chicano literature with a new and refreshing voice. Scott Wood, writing for America Press, asserted:
By 1976, four years after &quot;Bless Me Ultima&#x27;s&quot; initial publication, the new author was finding fans and fame among Chicano readers and scholars. He was in high demand as a speaker and the subject of numerous interviews primarily among journalists and publicists who were Chicanos or deeply interested in the development of Chicano literature. In the preface to his 1976 interview with Anaya reprinted in &quot;Conversations with Rudolfo Anaya&quot; (1998), Ishmael Reed states that, &quot;Bless Me Ultima&quot;, as of July 1, 1976, had sold 80,000 copies without a review in the major media.

For twenty-two years after the novel&#x27;s initial publication (its only availability through a small publisher notwithstanding), the novel sold 300,000 copies primarily through word of mouth. In this period the novel generated the largest body of review, interpretation, and analysis of any work of Chicano Literature (p. 1). Finally in 1994, a major publisher (Grand Central Publishing) issued a mass-market edition of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; to rave reviews.

Terri Windling described the 1994 re-issue as &quot;an important novel which beautifully melds Old World and New World folklore into a contemporary story&quot;.

In 2001, the first edition of The Chicano Studies Reader was published as a collection of the classic essays that have helped shape and influence Chicano studies. The 2001 anthology brings together a selection of twenty-one essays with three different goals in mind: 1) to reprint some of the classic essays that have helped shape and influence Chicano studies 2) to include work that suggests the broad disciplinary and thematic range of Chicano studies scholarship over the past three decades and 3) to historicize the journal and the field in a different way that both engages and challenges previous paradigms. The essay by David Carrasco titled &quot;A Perspective for a Study of Religious Dimensions in Chicano Experience: &#x27;Bless Me, Ultima&#x27; as a Religious Text&quot; was included in this anthology highlighting the importance of the religious dimension of &quot;Bless Me,Última&quot; in the field of Chicano Studies.

=== Censorship and challenges ===
After its publication in 1972, &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; emerged as one of the &quot;Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged Books&quot; in the years 2013 and 2008. According to the American Library association, a challenge is an attempt to restrict access of a book through the removal of the text in curriculum and libraries. Specific reasons for the challenges in 2013 were &quot;occult/Satanism, offensive language, religious viewpoint, sexually explicit&quot; and similarly in 2008 of &quot;occult/satanism, offensive language, religious viewpoint, sexually explicit, violence&quot;.

A particularly vivid experience in the censorship of this book for the author, Rudolfo Anaya, was in 1981: the Bloomfield School Board in San Juan County, New Mexico burned copies of the &quot;Bless Me, Ultima.&quot;

==== Round Rock Independent School District (Round Rock, Texas) ====
In 1996, after appearing on advanced placement and local high school reading lists in Round Rock Independent school district, the novel came to parents attention, which according to Foerstel led to “seven hours of boisterous debate over a proposal to remove a dozen books”, one of which was &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;. It came on January 19, 1996, from Round Rock Independent School District Board member Nelda Click. One of the worries of the parents was excessive violence. However, a local paper, The Austin American Statesman, claimed “ Refusing to allow credit for those celebrated literary works would have been an unnecessary intrusion by the school board.” After multiple hearing and proposals, the board came to a 4–2 vote against the banning of the book.

==== Laton School Board (Laton, California) ====
In May 1999, the Laton School Board removed two books, one being &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;, from teacher Carol Bennett&#x27;s English classes. The removal was proposed by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett&#x27;s students about the violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board&#x27;s action: &quot;What we are doing is trying to protect the children. And you got a teacher that&#x27;s trying to do what we do not think is right&quot;. All copies of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal&#x27;s office.

==== John Jay High School (Hopewell Junction, New York) ====
In October 1999, Deidra DiMaso was troubled when she read &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; to her two daughters. She was prompted to challenge the book&#x27;s placement in the high school&#x27;s ninth grade curriculum at at John Jay High School in the Wappingers Central School District. She addressed officials within the school and district and also spoke at a school board meeting in November of that year. Her reasoning was that the book “is full of sex and cursing”; she later expanded on her claims by saying “I asked the board members to please review all the books for any sexual content, violence, or foul language prior to any book becoming required reading.” Superintendent Wayne Gersen followed the standard protocol for addressing challenged materials. In November 1999, after a review by an &quot;ad hoc&quot; &quot;Instructional Materials Review Committee&quot; he accepted the recommendation of the committee to not ban the book. DiMaso appealed to the local school board, who denied her appeal in December 1999. The New York State Education Commissioner, Richard Paul Mills also denied a further appeal from DiMaso in June 2000.

==== Norwood School District (Norwood, Colorado) ====
In early 2005, Superintendent Bob Conder of the Norwood School District had banned Bless Me, Ultima in Norwood High School after a group of parents objected to the profanity and other themes the book contains; he himself had not read it but did enough reading to make the decision on the basis of the themes presented. Copies were removed from Lisa Doyle&#x27;s English class after she had used them while telling parents Conder had approved of its usage; Conder had Doyle apologize to the parents for the themes the book contains as well as lying about the status of Conder&#x27;s approval. At least twenty-four of the books were given to the group who destroyed the copies. Conder still approved the presence of copies available in the school library, but in hindsight wished to have donated the book.

In protest of the decision, on February 5, 2005, students formed a sit-in while reading passages from the center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard of or read the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, how am I going to get by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.

==== Blue Valley School District (Overland Park, Kansas) ====
In June 2005, Blue Valley School District held a challenge of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; from Georgiane Skid, a resident of the district. She requested the school board discuss the appropriateness of this novel being studied by the freshman class in a communications arts class. A committee made up of two students, two teachers, and two parents unanimously voted to keep the novel in the curriculum.

==== Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District (Newman, California) ====
In Orestimba High School on November 23, 2008, Superintendent Rick Fauss from the Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District banned the book on the grounds of a parental complaint that it was unsuitable for children due to profanity and anti-Catholic messages; teachers complained about Fauss&#x27;s decision as he overrode school board decisions at Stanislaus County Office of Education and Modesto City Schools that both came up with the conclusion to keep the book within the curriculum. The parents within the community were quiet on voicing any complaints. It came after a parent filed a complaint regarding &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;, the novel was withdrawn from the classroom, which affected the 200 students of whom were expected to read it over the course of the year. However, the policy&#x27;s responsibility was then handed over to the school board of Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District after Fauss stayed with his ban even after two panel decisions made up of educators within the district and outside the district. The final decision would be brought to the school board. The parent who made the original complaint argued that the text used explicit wording and anti-Catholic views “that undermine the conservative family values in our homes.” However, one attendee of the special meeting noted in favor of the book that &quot;I can&#x27;t think of a book, I can&#x27;t think of a newspaper article that&#x27;s not offensive to some people.&quot; The policy&#x27;s responsibility after the superintendent was then handed over to the school board of Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District. Ultimately, the board trustees voted 4–1 to remove &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; from the curriculum however the novel will continue to remain in the library based on the grounds of the previous complaint made.

=== Opinions on censorship ===
Linda Varvel is an English teacher who used &quot;Bless Me,&quot; &quot;Ultima&quot; for her students. Her essay on the censorship and the provoking aspects of the novel provide an opinion on why the novel caused issues within various school districts. She believes the novel should stay as a beneficial source of education to students. The book may utilize a critical lens of Catholicism, the overall theme of a child coming to terms with the world around him and forming opinions is a valuable story for all children and parents: &quot;The deeper message is one that many readers who would censor this novel must also believe: no one but God is all-powerful, and the mystery of life cannot be known entirely by human beings. This message might be the common ground to initiate any discussion around this kind of censorship challenge&quot;.

In reviewing the above cases of censorship where a group or individual challenges and/or ends up censoring this book, the reasoning is that the themes of anti-Catholic values, sex, excessive violence, adult language, and/or others are problematic for the values children of a community should have.

===Adaptations===

====Theatrical adaptations====
On April 10 and 12, 2008, in partnership with The National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; Big Read, Roberto Cantú, professor of Chicano Studies and English, who is intimately familiar with &quot;Bless Me, Ultima,&quot; produced a dramatic reading as a stage adaptation of the novel at Cal State L.A. Cantú first reviewed the work when it was published in 1972, and has published and lectured extensively on its art, structure, and significance. The production featured veteran television and film actress Alejandra Flores (&quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot;, &quot;Friends with Money&quot;) as Ultima. Theresa Larkin, a theatre arts professor at Cal State L.A., adapted and directed it.

Also in partnership with The Big Read program, Denver, Colorado&#x27;s premier Chicano theater company, Su Teatro, produced a full-length workshop stage production of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;, for which Anaya himself wrote the adaptation. The play opened on February 12, 2009, at El Centro Su Teatro, directed by Jennifer McCray Rinn, with the title roles of Ultima played by Yolanda Ortega, Antonio Márez by Carlo Rincón, and The Author by Jose Aguila. An encore production was done at The Shadow Theater in Denver on June 26 and 27, 2009, with the title roles of Ultima played by Yolanda Ortega, Antonio Marez by Isabelle Fries, and The Author by Jose Aguila.

The Vortex Theatre in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in partnership with the National Hispanic Center, produced a full stage production of the show from March 26, to April 25, 2010. It was directed by Valli Marie Rivera and again adapted by the author himself. Juanita Sena-Shannon played Ultima to rave reviews. The Vortex Production toured through various cities in New Mexico in October and November 2010. The final performance took place on November 19, 2010.

====Film adaptation====

&quot;Variety&quot; reported on March 2, 2009 that Christy Walton, heiress to the Walton fortune, had set up Tenaja Productions company solely to finance a film adaptation of &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;. Monkey Hill Films&#x27; Sarah DiLeo is billed as producer with collaboration and support from Mark Johnson (producer) of Gran Via Productions (&quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;) and Jesse B. Franklin of Monarch Pictures. Carl Franklin (&quot;One False Move&quot;, &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, &quot;Out of Time&quot;) was tapped as a writer and director. Walton and DiLeo shared a passion for the book, and the latter had succeeded in convincing Anaya to agree to the adaptation over six years back.

Shooting was scheduled in the Abiquiú area, and then resumed in Santa Fe for some interiors at Garson Studios on the Santa Fe University of Art and Design campus during the last week in October 2010. Filming wrapped in Santa Fe, New Mexico in late 2010. The film premiered at the Plaza Theatre in El Paso, Texas on September 17, 2012 and received a general release in February 2013.

====Operatic adaptation====
An opera based on &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; by composer and librettist Héctor Armienta had its premiere at the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in partnership with Opera Southwest, from February 18 through 25, 2018.

<text>Bode is a small crater located near the central region of the Moon, to the northwest of the joined craters Pallas and Murchison. It lies on a region of raised surface between the Mare Vaporum to the northeast, Sinus Aestuum to the west, and Sinus Medii to the southeast. The crater was named after German astronomer Johann Elert Bode.
This crater is bowl-shaped, with a small interior floor and a ridge along the inner wall to the northeast. It has a minor ray system that extends for a distance of 130 kilometers. There is a group of rilles located to the west of the crater named the Rimae Bode. Its name comes from the name of the crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bode.

<text>USS &quot;Bradley&quot; (FF-1041) was the second of ten 2,620-ton destroyer escorts, later reclassified as frigates, in the United States Navy. She was named for Captain Willis Winter Bradley Jr. She was later sold into the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Pernambuco&quot; (D 30).

== As &quot;Bradley&quot; ==
&quot;Bradley&quot; was laid down at San Francisco, California on 17 January 1963, launched on 26 March 1964, sponsored by Sue Worthington Bradley, and commissioned on 15 May 1965.

Her first deployment to the Western Pacific between July and December 1966 included four months of gunfire support along the coast of South Vietnam and carrier escort duty in the Gulf of Tonkin. In February 1967 Bradley received the prototype destroyer installation of the Sea Sparrow Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS). After intensive trials between May and September, the system was removed in September.

&quot;Bradley&quot; commenced her second deployment to Southeast Asia in December 1967 but was diverted to the Sea of Japan in response to the North Korean capture of as part of Operation Formation Star. In March she resumed carrier escort and gunfire support duties off South Vietnam. After a final tour on the gun line in June, during which she fired 3,247 rounds in 10 days from her two 5-inch/38 guns, she returned to San Diego, California in July 1968. Her first regular overhaul between October 1968 and May 1969 featured a major upgrade to her AN/SQS 26AXR sonar and extensive work on her two temperamental pressure-fired boilers. &quot;Bradley&quot;″s third deployment featured a gun line tour in January 1970, surveillance of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s worldwide &quot;Okean&quot; exercise in April, and more carrier escort and gunfire support duty lasting into June. During the next five years &quot;Bradley&quot; conducted three additional deployments to Southeast Asia, interrupted by a second regular overhaul in 1971–72.

In June 1975 &quot;Bradley&quot; began a year-long overhaul which included the enlargement of her helicopter hangar. In July 1975 she was reclassified from escort ship (DE) to frigate (FF). After trials in mid-1976, &quot;Bradley&quot; conducted two more deployments, each of which included lengthy operations in the Indian Ocean, before entering the shipyard in mid-1979 for another one-year overhaul. Repeating this pattern, she conducted another two deployments, this time ranging between Korea and Malaysia, before starting another year-long overhaul in mid-1983, primarily to remedy boiler problems. The ship made one more Western Pacific deployment between mid-1986 and January 1987 and a Northern Pacific cruise in May–June 1988 before decommissioning on 30 September 1988.

==Brazilian service==

In September 1989 &quot;Bradley&quot; was leased to Brazil at San Diego and became the destroyer &quot;Pernambuco&quot; (D 30). She was stricken from the U.S. Navy and sold outright to Brazil in January 2001. She remained active in the Brazilian Navy into her 39th year afloat, having participated at sea in seven exercises between early 2001 and early 2003. On 11 March 2004, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

<text>Chladni is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the northwest edge of Sinus Medii, in the central part of the Moon.

The crater is named for German physicist and musician Ernst Chladni who, in 1794, wrote the first book on meteorites. The rim of the crater is roughly circular, and there is a small central floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. This feature has a higher albedo than the surrounding terrain. It is connected by a low ridge to the rim of the crater Murchison, which lies to the northwest. Due east of Chladni is the larger Triesnecker.

<text>Long Time Dead is a 2002 horror film, co-written and directed by Marcus Adams in his directorial debut.

Set in the United Kingdom, the film follows a group of college students in which they experiment with an Ouija board and inadvertently summon a djinn, an Arabic spirit of fire, which puts their lives in danger.

The film stars Alec Newman, Marsha Thomason and Joe Absolom alongside Mel Raido, Lara Belmont, Melanie Gutteridge and Lukas Haas.

==Plot==

In 1979, a group of demon worshippers in Morocco try to invoke a spirit using a Ouija board. It had resulted in 8 deaths and 2 survivals.

In present-day London, 3 teenagers; Liam (Alec Newman), Rob (Joe Absolom) and Webster (Lukas Haas) prepare to go to a big party held at an abandoned warehouse. Another teenage girl, Stella (Lara Belmont) is also invited to the party and encounters Joe (Mel Raido), who would be the new roommate in the apartment the teenagers live in. She introduces Becker (Tom Bell), the landlord of the apartment to Joe. At the party, the teenagers hang out with Annie (Melanie Gutteridge), who is Liam&#x27;s girlfriend as well as Lucy (Marsha Thomason) and Spencer (James Hillier), who are two teenagers who reside in a boat. After the teenagers get high from drinking and smoking, Spencer suggests to everyone they should try to play a Ouija Board and they all agree with him.

The gang heads into an empty room within the factory and constructs a homemade Ouija Board using a glass and some paper. Lucy warns everyone that they should not take their finger off the glass or else the spirit they would be in contact with would be unable to return to its world. When the Ouija Board spells &quot;Djinn&quot;, Liam has a traumatic flashback of the Djinn killing everyone, freaks out, breaks the glass and runs away. Everyone realizes how horribly wrong it has gone and decide to leave. Later that night, the Djinn hunts down Annie by throwing her through the skylight and causing her to fall hard onto a table, killing her.

The teenagers later return to the apartment while Spencer and Lucy return to their boat, but a frightful encounter forces them to seek refuge at the apartment. While the teenagers try to investigate the cause of Annie&#x27;s death, a power outage occurs. When Spencer and Webster sneak into Becker&#x27;s room to turn the power back on, they discover a bunch of photos, relics and newspaper articles that he had kept and urge the others to come and see. They discover that Becker and Liam&#x27;s father, Paul Brennan (Michael Feast) once conducted a seance to come into contact with the Djinn and Paul was sent to a hospital. They decide to call the police.

The next day, the teenagers meet Liam at school to tell him what they had discovered, but Liam denies any knowledge of it. He later decides to visit Paul at the hospital to get some answers to his questions. Meanwhile, Becker visits Lucy to warn her that the Djinn has possessed one of the teenagers and she has to conduct a banishing to get rid of the evil spirits. At the same time, Stella, Joe and Webster progressively get killed by the Djinn. That night, Lucy meets Spencer and Rob to tell them her idea to banish the Djinn.

Lucy, Rob and Spencer head into the same abandoned factory where Annie was killed the night. Meanhwile, Liam notices that the 3 of them are missing and heads to the factory to look for them. The three teenagers try to conduct the banishing but it fails when the Ouija Board catches fire and explodes. Spencer tries to hide, but is killed by Rob (who was actually possessed by the Djinn the entire time). Becker arrives to knock Rob unconscious and covers him in gasoline, but Liam attacks Becker while Rob finishes the job.

Rob insists to Liam they should leave, but Liam finds Lucy hanged to her death inside an elevator shaft. When he asks Rob for help, the Djinn reveals itself and attacks Liam. In a scuffle, Liam picks up an oil lamp and uses it to ignite Rob on fire, and he kicks him down the elevator shaft. However, the shaft explodes and Liam is killed. With Liam dead, the Djinn possesses his body to visit Paul in the hospital, where he burns him.

<text>Junee () is a medium-sized town in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. The town&#x27;s prosperity and mixed services economy is based on a combination of agriculture, rail transport, light industry and government services, and in particular correctional services. In 2021 Junee&#x27;s urban population was .

==Place name==
One theory is that word &quot;Junee&quot; which originates from the Aboriginal word &#x27;Junee&#x27; means &quot;speak to me&quot;.
Another theory is that it is an Aboriginal word &quot;Choo-nee&quot; meaning &quot;frog&quot;.

==History==
The Wiradjuri people are the traditional owners of the local area prior to European settlement. Leopold de Salis (1816–1898), pastoralist and later politician was one of the first squatters to open up the Riverina region to grazing. He established the &#x27;Junee&#x27; pastoral run in 1845. Leopold held the licence for this run for a total of three years. Other run licencees followed until Thomas Hammond and Richard Gwynne bought the licence in 1857. The Junee run progressively reduced in area as selectors took up land but Hammond lived on it until his death in 1899, the remaining property having been named &quot;Wyoming&quot; in 1887. 
A post office opened in 1862 and a village called &#x27;Junee&#x27; was gazetted in 1863 on the wool road to Sydney. That same year, Ben Hall and his bushranging gang raided the village.
In 1866 Junee&#x27;s population was recorded as twelve but the discovery of reef and alluvial gold during the 1860s triggered a gold rush. The main sites- Junee Reefs (to the north), was mined on and off until after World War 1, as well as Wantiool and Eurongilly (to the east) until the 1880s.

By 1878 with the southward expansion of the Main South line in New South Wales, the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne passed 8 kilometres east of the Village. Junee&#x27;s Post Office was renamed Old Junee in 1885 (Junee railway station). Loftus was the original name of the locality being farm land and as the settlers moved in for the rail line it was renamed. Junee Railway Station Post Office opened on 6 July 1878, was renamed Junee Junction in 1881 and later still, Junee in 1893.

===Rail and road===
The Main South line between Sydney and Melbourne runs through Junee, as does the Olympic Highway, named for the route of the 1956 Summer Olympics Torch Relay.
The advent of rail transport in 1878 provided the impetus for an economic boom providing local agricultural producers with affordable direct access to markets in Sydney. In 1952 the largest wheat terminal in the Southern Hemisphere was constructed at Junee, adjacent to the South West Railway, providing both rail and road transport.

Rail transport makes an important contribution to the local economy with Regional Rail Logistics operating a containerised freight service that delivers various goods from Junee to Sydney, with interstate freight trains also passing through the town.

===Local Government===
On 1 January 1981, Junee Municipal Council amalgamated with the surrounding &quot;Illabo Shire Council&#x27;, creating Junee Shire Council.

A small group of Confederate troops and volunteers, which included teenagers from the nearby Florida Military and Collegiate Institute that would later become Florida State University, protected by breastworks, prevented a detachment of United States Colored Troops from crossing the Natural Bridge on the St. Marks River.

The Natural Bridge is a stretch along which the St. Marks River runs underground, after dropping into a sinkhole. 

==Battle==
The Union&#x27;s Brig. Gen. John Newton had undertaken a joint force expedition to engage and destroy Confederate troops that had attacked at Cedar Keys, Florida and Fort Myers and were allegedly encamped somewhere around St. Marks. The Union Navy had trouble getting its ships up the St. Marks River. The Union Army force, however, had advanced and, after finding one bridge destroyed, started before dawn on March 6 to attempt to cross the river at Natural Bridge. The Union troops initially pushed Rebel forces back, but not away from the bridge.

Sailors from USS Hendrick Hudson also participated, and two were awarded the Medal of Honor for their part in this battle: Seaman John Mack and Coxswain George Schutt.

Confederate forces under Brigade General William Miller, protected by breastworks, guarded all of the approaches and the bridge itself. The action at Natural Bridge lasted most of the day, but, unable to take the bridge in three separate charges, the Union troops retreated to the protection of the fleet.

Based on the involvement of the students from the Florida Military and Collegiate Institute, the Florida State University Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program is one of only four Army ROTC programs to have a battle streamer for their actions in the Civil War. Since it was originally part of the Army, FSU&#x27;s Air Force ROTC unit also displays the same battle streamer.

While the raid was not aimed at Tallahassee, the defeat of the Union force is regarded as keeping Tallahassee as the only Confederate state capital east of the Mississippi River that was not captured by the Union during the war.

==Legacy==

The site has been preserved in the Natural Bridge Battlefield State Historic Site. As of mid-2023, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield that are now part of the state park.

A ceremony honoring the combatants on both sides of the Battle of Natural Bridge, followed by a reenactment of the battle featuring Union, Confederate, and civilian reenactors, is held at the park the first weekend of March every year. The event is free and open to the public.

<text>Euler is a lunar impact crater located in the southern half of the Mare Imbrium, and is named after the Swiss mathematician, physician and astronomer Leonhard Euler. The most notable nearby feature is Mons Vinogradov to the west-southwest. There is a cluster of low ridges to the southwest, and this formation includes the small crater Natasha and the tiny Jehan. About 200 kilometers to the east-northeast is the comparably sized crater Lambert.

Euler&#x27;s rim is surrounded by a low , and contain some slight and slumped features on the irregular inner wall surface. In the middle of the small interior floor is a low central peak that formed from the rebound subsequent to the impact. The crater has a minor system of rays that extend for a distance of 200 kilometers.

Euler is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Euler.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Euler K — &quot;See&quot; Jehan.
* Euler P — &quot;See&quot; Natasha.

<doc id="983751" wikidata="Q275310" url="?curid=983751" title="Marcia Strassman">
<text>Marcia Ann Strassman (April 28, 1948 – October 24, 2014) was an American actress and singer. She had roles on the TV programs &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, as well as in the film &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;.

==Life and career==
Strassman succeeded Liza Minnelli in the role of Ethel Hofflinger in the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;.

In 1967, she became a recording artist for Uni Records. Her debut single, &quot;The Flower Children&quot;, was a top-40 hit in many West Coast U.S. markets, hitting #4 in San Diego and #2 in San Francisco; the track also hit #3 in Vancouver, British Columbia (both at CKLG 730 AM and CFUN 1410 AM in July 1967). However, the single failed to break out nationally in either country; the record stalled at #105 in the United States, and just sneaked into RPM&#x27;s Top 100 for Canada, peaking at #95. The song also reached #95 on &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 Singles chart 


Her follow-up release, &quot;The Groovy World of Jack and Jill&quot;, charted in Denver, Colorado, but virtually nowhere else. A third single, &quot;Star Gazer&quot; (1968) (produced by Kim Fowley), failed to chart anywhere and brought Strassman&#x27;s brief recording career to a close. Returning to acting after a gap of a few years, she landed the recurring role of Nurse Margie Cutler in six early episodes of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;

She landed the role of Julie Kotter, the wife of title character high school teacher Gabe Kotter (Gabe Kaplan) on the ABC comedy series &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; in 1975. The series lasted four years. Strassman was told that Kaplan wanted her off the series, and stated in an interview that working on the series made her &quot;miserable&quot;. Kaplan read the interview and realized that series producer James Komack was separately telling the two actors that they didn&#x27;t like each other, and Kaplan informed Strassman that he actually wanted more balance between Kotter&#x27;s work and home environments, which would have afforded her the chance to do more on the series. Kaplan, a guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that week, had Strassman on to tell the story as an interview guest; she recalled the incident decades later on a Biography Channel special about the history of &quot;Kotter&quot;.

In the 1970s, Strassman did guest spots on &quot;Time Express&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, among other shows. In 1980, she starred as Lenina Crowne in a television production of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;. She co-starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Good Time Harry&quot; that year. She guest-starred on the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; episode &quot;Heal Thyself&quot;, where she played Dr. Karen Harmon, a former nurse with whom the title character served in Vietnam. In 1982, she played Maria Giannin in the romantic comedy &quot;Soup for One&quot;.

In 1989–90, she had a co-starring role on the &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; spin-off, &quot;Booker&quot;, starring Richard Grieco in the title role. She guest starred on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in 1996. Strassman had movie roles as Rick Moranis&#x27;s wife in &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989) and &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; (1992). In 1994, she reprised her role from those movies in the 3-D film spin-off &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!&quot; She later went on to play Nancy Sterngood on the television series &quot;Tremors&quot; (2003).

==Death==
In March 2007, Strassman was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer that had spread to her bones. Her memoir, in which she discussed her life, career, and illness, was published in 2008. Strassman died of the disease at her home in Sherman Oaks, California, on October 24, 2014. She was 66 years old. She had a daughter, Elizabeth Collector (from her 1984 to 1989 marriage to Robert Collector).

<doc id="983752" wikidata="Q1101058" url="?curid=983752" title="Faraday (crater)">
<text>Faraday is a lunar impact crater in the southern highlands of the Moon. It was named after British chemist and physicist Michael Faraday. It lies across the southeast rim of the larger crater Stöfler, and the northwest rim of Faraday forms a wide across the otherwise flat floor of Stöfler. To the east of Faraday is Maurolycus.

The rim of Faraday has been significantly overlain by subsequent impacts, most notably by an overlapping pair across the southwest rim and a crater across the northwest rim. There is a low central ridge running from the southwest to the northeast, nearly dividing the crater floor in half. The floor is nearly flat in the northwest half.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Faraday.

Due to its ray system, Faraday C is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

<doc id="983753" wikidata="Q7799451" url="?curid=983753" title="Thurston Howell III">
<text>Thurston Howell III (mentioned in the opening credits as: &quot;The Millionaire&quot;) is a character on the CBS television sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which ran from 1964 to 1967, and later in syndication.

==Portrayal==
Howell, portrayed by veteran character actor Jim Backus, took hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and several changes of clothing with him for what was intended to be only a three-hour boat tour in Hawaii. Speaking with a Locust Valley lockjaw accent, Howell is a stereotypical member of the New England Yankee elite – a resident of Newport, Rhode Island, a graduate of Harvard University and a Republican. He is a member of the Newport Country Club, Oyster Bay Yacht Club, and the Union League Club where he has a &quot;window seat&quot;. His wife, Lovey, portrayed by Natalie Schafer, is conscious of social strata, yet seems to be a good-hearted woman with a deep sense of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, allowing her to interact with the other passengers and crew, though regarding them all as her social inferiors. One of the implied humorous points of the show is that Thurston continually fails to realize that all of the Howells&#x27; money is essentially useless to them on the island. On the other hand, the other castaways apparently tolerate the fact that he refuses to do any work. One exception is when an egocentric Hollywood producer (played by Phil Silvers) &quot;visited&quot; the island and the Howells had to wait on him as butler and maid in order to be rescued. One of the most unusual aspects of his character is that, even though he is married, he sleeps with a teddy bear that he calls &quot;Teddy&quot;. The Howells, as was common practice on American sitcoms of the mid-1960s, slept in twin beds. Thurston Howell III was the basis of a character in the television sitcom &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot; which was based on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Though described as a cunning, ruthless businessman, whose nickname was &quot;The wolf of Wall Street&quot;, he is shown to have some moral scruples-when a mad scientist lures the castaways to his private island and shows Mr. Howell technology he had developed to switch peoples&#x27; bodies, he then asks for Mr. Howell&#x27;s help in switching the bodies of world leaders with his personal minions to take over the world. Mr. Howell instead turns him down and tells his fellow castaways about the scientist’s intentions.

==Wealth==
Howell was included on &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 2006 list of the 15 richest fictional characters. Just how much money he had was never specified, but he was shown as owning several large corporations. In the pilot episode, when the radio announcer reads the names of the lost passengers, they refer to Mr Howell as a billionaire. Also when asked what happened to him during the Great Depression, his wife says that he was a billionaire, lost most of his money and &quot;became just a millionaire.&quot; Among his assets were a diamond mine, a coconut plantation, a railroad, an oil well, and in Colorado – which included all of downtown Denver – that he bequeathed to his fellow castaways in his will. He also owned the Hatchet-Cuckoo Oil Company in Dust Bowl, Oklahoma. He tried to shove this supposedly worthless oil company on Gilligan. When he hears that an imposter is going to sell off his companies for cash, he is so enraged that he tries to swim back to the mainland three times, intent on killing the man, only to be stopped by Gilligan, the Skipper, and wife Lovey.

==Spin-offs==
Backus reprised his role in the three spin-off movies of the original series, although in the last one (&quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;) Backus&#x27;s declining health only allowed him to make a three-minute cameo appearance at the conclusion. Although the Howells never had any children in the original series, their son Thurston Howell IV (portrayed by David Ruprecht) is introduced in the last movie. The younger Howell&#x27;s mannerisms are similar to those of his father.

<text>MIFARE is a series of integrated circuit (IC) chips used in contactless smart cards and proximity cards.

The brand includes proprietary solutions based on various levels of the ISO/IEC 14443 Type-A 13.56 MHz contactless smart card standard. It uses AES and DES/Triple-DES encryption standards, as well as an older proprietary encryption algorithm, Crypto-1. According to NXP, 10 billion of their smart card chips and over 150 million reader modules have been sold.

The MIFARE trademark is owned by NXP Semiconductors, which was spun off from Philips Electronics in 2006.

==Variants==
MIFARE products are embedded in contactless and contact smart cards, smart paper tickets, wearables and phones.

The MIFARE brand name (derived from the term MIKRON FARE collection and created by the company Mikron) covers four families of contactless cards:
; MIFARE Classic: Employs a proprietary protocol compliant with parts 1–3 of ISO/IEC 14443 Type A, with an NXP proprietary security protocol for authentication and ciphering.

Subtypes: MIFARE Classic EV1 (other subtypes are no longer in use).
; MIFARE Plus: Drop-in replacement for MIFARE Classic with certified security level (AES-128 based) and is fully backwards compatible with MIFARE Classic.

Subtypes: MIFARE Plus S, MIFARE Plus X, MIFARE Plus SE and MIFARE Plus EV2.
; MIFARE Ultralight: Low-cost ICs that are useful for high volume applications such as public transport, loyalty cards and event ticketing.

Subtypes: MIFARE Ultralight C, MIFARE Ultralight EV1, MIFARE Ultralight Nano and MIFARE Ultralight AES.
; MIFARE DESFire: Contactless ICs that comply with parts 3 and 4 of ISO/IEC 14443-4 Type A with a mask-ROM operating system from NXP. The &quot;DES&quot; in the name refers to the use of a DES, two-key 3DES, three-key 3DES and AES encryption; while &quot;Fire&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Fast, innovative, reliable, and enhanced&quot;.

Subtypes: MIFARE DESFire EV1, MIFARE DESFire EV2, MIFARE DESFire EV3 and MIFARE DESFire Light.

There is also the MIFARE SAM AV2 contact smart card. This can be used to handle the encryption in communicating with the contactless cards. The SAM (Secure Access Module) provides the secure storage of cryptographic keys and cryptographic functions.

===MIFARE Classic family===
The MIFARE Classic IC is a basic memory storage device, where the memory is divided into segments and blocks with simple security mechanisms for access control. They are ASIC-based and have limited computational power. Due to their reliability and low cost, those cards are widely used for electronic wallets, access control, corporate ID cards, transportation or stadium ticketing. It uses an NXP proprietary security protocol (Crypto-1) for authentication and ciphering.

MIFARE Classic encryption has been compromised; see below for details.

The MIFARE Classic with 1K memory offers 1,024 bytes of data storage, split into 16 &quot;sectors&quot;; each sector is protected by two different keys, called &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Each key can be programmed to allow operations such as reading, writing, increasing value blocks, etc. MIFARE Classic with 4K memory offers 4,096 bytes split into forty sectors, of which 32 are the same size as in the 1K with eight more that are quadruple size sectors. MIFARE Classic Mini offers 320 bytes split into five sectors. For each of these IC types, 16 bytes per sector are reserved for the keys and access conditions and can not normally be used for user data. Also, the very first 16 bytes contain the serial number of the card and certain other manufacturer data and are read-only. That brings the net storage capacity of these cards down to 752 bytes for MIFARE Classic with 1K memory, 3,440 bytes for MIFARE Classic with 4K memory, and 224 bytes for MIFARE Mini.
The Samsung TecTile NFC tag stickers use MIFARE Classic chips. This means only devices with an NXP NFC controller chip can read or write these tags. At the moment BlackBerry phones, the Nokia Lumia 610 (August 2012), the Google Nexus 4, Google Nexus 7 LTE and Nexus 10 (October 2013) can&#x27;t read/write TecTile stickers.

===MIFARE Plus family===

====MIFARE Plus====
MIFARE Plus is a replacement IC solution for the MIFARE Classic.

It is less flexible than a MIFARE DESFire EV1 contactless IC.

MIFARE Plus was publicly announced in March 2008 with first samples in Q1 2009.

MIFARE Plus, when used in older transportation systems that do not yet support AES on the reader side, still leaves an open door to attacks. Though it helps to mitigate threats from attacks that broke the Crypto-1 cipher through the weak random number generator, it does not help against brute force attacks and crypto analytic attacks.

During the transition period from MIFARE Classic to MIFARE Plus where only a few readers might support AES in the first place, it offers an optional AES authentication in Security Level 1 (which is in fact MIFARE Classic operation). This does not prevent the attacks mentioned above but enables a secure mutual authentication between the reader and the card to prove that the card belongs to the system and is not fake.

In its highest security level SL3, using 128-bit AES encryption, MIFARE Plus is secured from attacks.

==== MIFARE Plus EV1 ====
MIFARE Plus EV1 was announced in April 2016.

New features compared to MIFARE Plus X include:

; Sector-wise security-level switching: The choice of crypto algorithm used in the authentication protocol can be set separately for each sector. This makes it possible to use the same card with both readers that can read MIFARE Classic products (with sectors protected by 48-bit CRYPTO1 keys, &quot;Security Level 1&quot;) and readers that can read MIFARE Plus products (with sectors protected by 128-bit AES keys, &quot;Security Level 3&quot;). This feature is intended to make it easier to gradually migrate existing MIFARE Classic product-based installations to MIFARE Plus, without having to replace all readers at the same time.
; ISO 7816-4 wrapping: The card can now be accessed in either the protocol for MIFARE (which is not compliant with the ISO 7816-4 APDU format), or using a new protocol variant that runs on top of ISO 7816-4. This way the cards become compatible with NFC reader APIs that can only exchange messages in ISO 7816-4 APDU format, with a maximum transfer data buffer size of 256 bytes.
; Proximity check: While the protocol for MIFARE Classic tolerated message delays of several seconds, and was therefore vulnerable to relay attacks, MIFARE Plus EV1 now implements a basic &quot;ISO compliant&quot; distance-bounding protocol. This puts tighter timing constraints on the permitted round-trip delay during authentication, to make it harder to forward messages to far-away cards or readers via computer networks.
; Secure end-2-end channel: Permits AES-protected over-the-air updates even to Crypto1 application sectors (SL1SL3 mix mode).
; Transaction MAC: The card can produce an additional message-authentication code over a transaction that can be verified by a remote clearing service, independent of the keys used by the local reader during the transaction.

==== MIFARE Plus EV2 ====
The MIFARE Plus EV2 was introduced to the market on 23 June 2020. It comes with an enhanced read performance and transaction speed compared to MIFARE Plus EV1.

New features compared to MIFARE Plus EV1 include:
; Transaction Timer: To help mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks, the Transaction Timer feature, which is also available on NXP&#x27;s MIFARE DESFire EV3 IC, makes it possible to set a maximum time per transaction, so it&#x27;s harder for an attacker to interfere with the transaction.

===MIFARE Ultralight family===

====MIFARE Ultralight====
The MIFARE Ultralight has only 512 bits of memory (i.e. 64 bytes), without cryptographic security. The memory is provided in 16 &quot;pages&quot; of 4 bytes. Cards based on these chips are so inexpensive that they are often used for disposable tickets for events such as the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
It provides only basic security features such as one-time-programmable (OTP) bits and a write-lock feature to prevent re-writing of memory pages but does not include cryptography as applied in other MIFARE product-based cards.

====MIFARE Ultralight EV1====
MIFARE Ultralight EV1 introduced in November 2012 the next generation of paper ticketing smart card ICs for limited-use applications for ticketing schemes and additional security options. It comes with several enhancements above the original MIFARE Ultralight:
* 384 and 1024 bits user memory product variants
* OTP, lock bits, configurable counters for improved security
* Three independent 24-bit one-way counters to stop reloading
* Protected data access through 32-bit password
* NXP Semiconductors originality signature function, this is an integrated originality checker and is effective cloning protection that helps to prevent counterfeit of tickets. However, this protection is applicable only to &quot;mass penetration of non NXP originated chips and does not prevent hardware copy or emulation of a single existing valid chip&quot;

====MIFARE Ultralight C====
Introduced at the Cartes industry trade show in 2008, the MIFARE Ultralight C IC is part of NXP&#x27;s low-cost MIFARE product offering (disposable ticket). With Triple DES, MIFARE Ultralight C uses a widely adopted standard, enabling easy integration in existing infrastructures. The integrated Triple DES authentication provides an effective countermeasure against cloning.

Key applications for MIFARE Ultralight C are public transportation, event ticketing, loyalty and NFC Forum tag type 2.

====MIFARE Ultralight AES====
It was introduced in 2022.

===MIFARE DESFire family===

====MIFARE DESFire====
The MIFARE DESFire (MF3ICD40) was introduced in 2002 and is based on a core similar to SmartMX, with more hardware and software security features than MIFARE Classic. It comes pre-programmed with the general-purpose MIFARE DESFire operating system which offers a simple directory structure and files. They are sold in four variants: One with Triple-DES only and 4 KiB of storage, and three with AES (2, 4, or 8 kiB; see MIFARE DESFire EV1). The AES variants have additional security features; e.g., CMAC. MIFARE DESFire uses a protocol compliant with ISO/IEC 14443-4. The contactless IC is based on an 8051 processor with 3DES/AES cryptographic accelerator, making very fast transactions possible.

The maximal read/write distance between card and reader is , but the actual distance depends on the field power generated by the reader and its antenna size.

In 2010, NXP announced the discontinuation of the MIFARE DESFire (MF3ICD40) after it had introduced its successor MIFARE DESFire EV1 (MF3ICD41) in late 2008. In October 2011 researchers of Ruhr University Bochum announced that they had broken the security of MIFARE DESFire (MF3ICD40), which was acknowledged by NXP (see MIFARE DESFire security).

====MIFARE DESFire EV1====
First evolution of MIFARE DESFire contactless IC, broadly backwards compatible. Available with 2 KiB, 4 KiB, and 8 KiB non-volatile memory. Other features include:
* Support for random ID
* Support for 128-bit AES
* Hardware and operating system are Common Criteria certified at level EAL 4+

MIFARE DESFire EV1 was publicly announced in November 2006.

====MIFARE DESFire EV2====

The second evolution of the MIFARE DESFire contactless IC family, broadly backwards compatible.
New features include:
* MI smart App enabling to offer or sell memory space for additional applications of 3rd parties without the need to share secret keys
* Transaction MAC to authenticate transactions by 3rd parties
* Virtual Card Architecture for privacy protection
* Proximity check against relay attacks

MIFARE DESFire EV2 was publicly announced in March 2016 at the IT-TRANS event in Karlsruhe, Germany

====MIFARE DESFire EV3====

The latest evolution of the MIFARE DESFire contactless IC family, broadly backward compatible. New features include:

* ISO/IEC 14443 A 1–4 and ISO/IEC 7816-4 compliant
* Common Criteria EAL5+ certified for IC hardware and software
* NFC Forum Tag Type 4 compliant
* SUN message authentication for advanced data protection within standard NDEF read operation
* Choice of open DES/2K3DES/3K3DES/AES crypto algorithms
* Flexible file structure: hosts as many applications as the memory size supports
* Proof of transaction with card generated MAC
* Transaction Timer mitigates risk of man-in-the-middle attacks

MIFARE DESFire EV3 was publicly announced on 2 June 2020.

===MIFARE SAM AV2===
MIFARE SAMs are not contactless smart cards. They are secure access modules designed to provide the secure storage of cryptographic keys and cryptographic functions for terminals to access the MIFARE products securely and to enable secure communication between terminals and host (backend). MIFARE SAMs are available from NXP in the contact-only module (PCM 1.1) as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-2 and the HVQFN32 format.

Integrating a MIFARE SAM AV2 in a contactless smart card reader enables a design that integrates high-end cryptography features and the support of cryptographic authentication and data encryption/decryption. Like any SAM, it offers functionality to store keys securely and perform authentication and encryption of data between the contactless card and the SAM and the SAM towards the backend. Next to a classical SAM architecture, the MIFARE SAM AV2 supports the X-mode which allows a fast and convenient contactless terminal development by connecting the SAM to the microcontroller and reader IC simultaneously.

MIFARE SAM AV2 offers AV1 mode and AV2 mode where in comparison to the SAM AV1 the AV2 version includes public key infrastructure (PKI), hash functions like SHA-1, SHA-224, and SHA-256. It supports MIFARE Plus and secure host communication. Both modes provide the same communication interfaces, cryptographic algorithms (Triple-DES 112-bit and 168-bit key, MIFARE products using Crypto1, AES-128 and AES-192, RSA with up to 2048-bit keys), and X-mode functionalities. The MIFARE SAM AV3 is the third generation of NXP&#x27;s Secure Access Module, and it supports MIFARE ICs as well as NXP&#x27;s UCODE DNA, ICODE DNA and NTAG DNA ICs.

=== MIFARE 2GO ===
A cloud-based platform that digitizes MIFARE product-based smart cards and makes them available on NFC-enabled smartphones and wearables. With this, new Smart City use cases such as mobile transit ticketing, mobile access and mobile micropayments are being enabled.

The MIFARE product portfolio was originally developed by Mikron in Gratkorn, Austria. Mikron was acquired by Philips in 1995. Mikron sourced silicon from Atmel in the US, Philips in the Netherlands, and Siemens in Germany.

Infineon Technologies (then Siemens) licensed MIFARE Classic from Mikron in 1994 and developed both stand alone and integrated designs with MIFARE product functions. Infineon currently produces various derivatives based on MIFARE Classic including 1K memory (SLE66R35) and various microcontrollers (8 bit (SLE66 series), 16 bit (SLE7x series), and 32 bit (SLE97 series) with MIFARE implementations, including devices for use in USIM with Near Field Communication.

Motorola tried to develop MIFARE product-like chips for the wired-logic version but finally gave up. The project expected one million cards per month for start, but that fell to 100,000 per month just before they gave up the project.

In 1998 Philips licensed MIFARE Classic to Hitachi Hitachi licensed MIFARE products for the development of the contactless smart card solution for NTT&#x27;s IC telephone card which started in 1999 and finished in 2006. In the NTT contactless IC telephone card project, three parties joined: Tokin-Tamura-Siemens, Hitachi (Philips-contract for technical support), and Denso (Motorola-only production). NTT asked for two versions of chip, i.e. wired-logic chip (like MIFARE Classic) with small memory and big memory capacity. Hitachi developed only big memory version and cut part of the memory to fit for the small memory version.

The deal with Hitachi was upgraded in 2008 by NXP (by then no longer part of Philips) to include MIFARE Plus and MIFARE DESFire to the renamed semiconductor division of Hitachi Renesas Technology.

In 2010 NXP licensed MIFARE products to Gemalto. In 2011 NXP licensed Oberthur to use MIFARE products on SIM cards. In 2012 NXP signed an agreement with Giesecke &amp; Devrient to integrate MIFARE product-based applications on their secure SIM products. These licensees are developing Near Field Communication products

==Security==

=== MIFARE Classic ===
The encryption used by the MIFARE Classic IC uses a 48-bit key.

A presentation by Henryk Plötz and Karsten Nohl at the Chaos Communication Congress in December 2007 described a partial reverse-engineering of the algorithm used in the MIFARE Classic chip. A paper that describes the process of reverse engineering this chip was published at the August 2008 USENIX security conference.

In March 2008 the Digital Security research group of the Radboud University Nijmegen made public that they performed a complete reverse-engineering and were able to clone and manipulate the contents of an OV-Chipkaart which is using MIFARE Classic chip. For demonstration they used the Proxmark3 device, a 125 kHz / 13.56 MHz research instrument. The schematics and software are released under the free GNU General Public License by Jonathan Westhues in 2007. They demonstrate it is even possible to perform card-only attacks using just an ordinary stock-commercial NFC reader in combination with the libnfc library.

The Radboud University published four scientific papers concerning the security of the MIFARE Classic:
* A Practical Attack on the MIFARE Classic
* Dismantling MIFARE Classic
* Wirelessly Pickpocketing a MIFARE Classic Card
* Ciphertext-only Cryptanalysis on Hardened MIFARE Classic Cards

In response to these attacks, the Dutch Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations stated that they would investigate whether the introduction of the Dutch Rijkspas could be brought forward from Q4 of 2008.

NXP tried to stop the publication of the second article by requesting a preliminary injunction. However, the injunction was denied, with the court noting that, &quot;It should be considered that the publication of scientific studies carries a lot of weight in a democratic society, as does inform society about serious issues in the chip because it allows for mitigating of the risks.&quot;

Both independent research results are confirmed by the manufacturer NXP. These attacks on the cards didn&#x27;t stop the further introduction of the card as the only accepted card for all Dutch public transport the OV-chipkaart continued as nothing happened but in October 2011 the company TLS, responsible for the OV-Chipkaart announced that the new version of the card will be better protected against fraud.

The MIFARE Classic encryption Crypto-1 can be broken in about 200 seconds on a laptop from 2008, if approx. 50 bits of known (or chosen) keystream are available. This attack reveals the key from sniffed transactions under certain (common) circumstances and/or allows an attacker to learn the key by challenging the reader device.

Another attack recovers the secret key in about 40 ms on a laptop. This attack requires just one (partial) authentication attempt with a legitimate reader. 

Additionally, there are a number of attacks that work directly on a card and without the help of a valid reader device. These attacks have been acknowledged by NXP. 
In April 2009 new and better card-only attack on MIFARE Classic has been found. It was first announced at the rump session of Eurocrypt 2009. 
This attack was presented at SECRYPT 2009. 
The full description of this latest and fastest attack to date can also be found in the IACR preprint archive. 
The new attack improves by a factor of more than 10 all previous card-only attacks on MIFARE Classic, has instant running time, and does not require a costly precomputation. The new attack allows recovering the secret key of any sector of the MIFARE Classic card via wireless interaction, within about 300 queries to the card. It can then be combined with the nested authentication attack in the Nijmegen Oakland paper to recover subsequent keys almost instantly. Both attacks combined and with the right hardware equipment such as Proxmark3, one should be able to clone any MIFARE Classic card in 10 seconds or less. This is much faster than previously thought.

In an attempt to counter these card-only attacks, new &quot;hardened&quot; cards have been released in and around 2011, such as the MIFARE Classic EV1. These variants are insusceptible for all card-only attacks publicly known until then, while remaining backward compatible with the original MIFARE Classic. In 2015, a new card-only attack was discovered that is also able to recover the secret keys from such hardened variants.
Since the discovery of this attack, NXP is officially recommending to migrate from MIFARE Classic product-based systems to higher security products.

===MIFARE DESFire===
In November 2010, security researchers from the Ruhr University released a paper detailing a side-channel attack against MIFARE product-based cards. The paper demonstrated that MIFARE DESFire product-based cards could be easily emulated at a cost of approximately $25 in &quot;off the shelf&quot; hardware. The authors asserted that this side-channel attack allowed cards to be cloned in approximately 100 ms. Furthermore, the paper&#x27;s authors included hardware schematics for their original cloning device, and have since made corresponding software, firmware and improved hardware schematics publicly available on GitHub.

In October 2011 David Oswald and Christof Paar of Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany, detailed how they were able to conduct a successful &quot;side-channel&quot; attack against the card using equipment that can be built for nearly $3,000. Called &quot;Breaking MIFARE DESFire MF3ICD40: Power Analysis and Templates in the Real World&quot;, they stated that system integrators should be aware of the new security risks that arise from the presented attacks and can no longer rely on the mathematical security of the used 3DES cipher. Hence, to avoid, e.g. manipulation or cloning of smart cards used in payment or access control solutions, proper actions have to be taken: on the one hand, multi-level countermeasures in the back end allow to minimize the threat even if the underlying RFID platform is insecure,&quot; In a statement NXP said that the attack would be difficult to replicate and that they had already planned to discontinue the product at the end of 2011. NXP also stated &quot;Also, the impact of a successful attack depends on the end-to-end system security design of each individual infrastructure and whether diversified keys – recommended by NXP – are being used. If this is the case, a stolen or lost card can be disabled simply by the operator detecting the fraud and blacklisting the card, however, this operation assumes that the operator has those mechanisms implemented. This will make it even harder to replicate the attack with a commercial purpose.&quot;

===MIFARE Ultralight===
In September 2012 a security consultancy Intrepidus demonstrated at the EU SecWest event in Amsterdam, that MIFARE Ultralight product-based fare cards in the New Jersey and San Francisco transit systems can be manipulated using an Android application, enabling travelers to reset their card balance and travel for free in a talk entitled &quot;NFC For Free Rides and Rooms (on your phone)&quot;. Although not a direct attack on the chip but rather the reloading of an unprotected register on the device, it allows hackers to replace value and show that the card is valid for use. This can be overcome by having a copy of the register online so that values can be analyzed and suspect cards hot-listed. NXP has responded by pointing out that they had introduced the MIFARE Ultralight C in 2008 with 3DES protection and in November 2012 introduced the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 with three decrement only counters to foil such reloading attacks.

==Considerations for systems integration==
For systems based on contactless smartcards (e.g. public transportation), security against fraud relies on many components, of which the card is just one. Typically, to minimize costs, systems integrators will choose a relatively cheap card such as a MIFARE Classic and concentrate security efforts in the back office. Additional encryption on the card, transaction counters, and other methods known in cryptography are then employed to make cloned cards useless, or at least to enable the back office to detect a fraudulent card, and put it on a blacklist. Systems that work with online readers only (i.e., readers with a permanent link to the back office) are easier to protect than systems that have offline readers as well, for which real-time checks are not possible and blacklists cannot be updated as frequently.

==Certification==
Another aspect of fraud prevention and compatibility guarantee is to obtain certification called to live in 1998 ensuring the compatibility of several certified MIFARE product-based cards with multiple readers. With this certification, the main focus was placed on the contactless communication of the wireless interface, as well as to ensure proper implementation of all the commands of MIFARE product-based cards. The certification process was developed and carried out by the Austrian laboratory called Arsenal Research. Today, independent test houses such as Arsenal Testhouse, UL and LSI-TEC, perform the certification tests and provide the certified products in an online database.

<doc id="983758" wikidata="Q1398851" url="?curid=983758" title="Fauth (crater)">
<text>Fauth is a small double-crater located at the edge of the rough southern ramparts of the prominent ray crater Copernicus on the Moon. It lies in the Mare Insularum, to the northeast of the crater Reinhold. The crater is named after German selenographer Philipp Johann Heinrich Fauth.

This formation is composed of the merged craters Fauth and the slightly smaller Fauth A. The latter craterlet cuts into the southern rim of Fauth and has a radius of 9.6 kilometers. Fauth is most likely a secondary crater that was created by the formation of Copernicus.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fauth.

<doc id="983763" wikidata="Q1141551" url="?curid=983763" title="Gundam (fictional robot)">
<text>The is a fictional manned robot (mecha), introduced in 1979 in Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s and Sunrise&#x27;s anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. In the series, it is a prototype weapon for the Earth Federation when it falls into the hands of Amuro Ray, the son of its designer in story (Tem Ray), who goes on to pilot it in the Earth Federation&#x27;s war against the Principality of Zeon.

As the success of the series began the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, the robot&#x27;s design was the first of many variations in subsequent works. The design appearing in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; serves as the symbol of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise and sparked the creation of its multiple sequels and spinoffs; most future Gundams featured use the RX-78-2&#x27;s color scheme and shape.

==Conception and design==
The RX-78&#x27;s initial concept was that of a powered armor, the primary design for Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s proposed series &quot;Freedom Fighter Gunboy&quot;. The series later changed its name to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; and Kunio Okawara was given Tomino&#x27;s concept to shape into a finalized design for the anime. Okawara created multiple designs before settling on the current, samurai-styled design for the anime in 1979.

Enemies in the series regularly refer to the RX-78-2 as the &quot;white suit&quot; or the &quot;White Devil&quot; (due to the suit&#x27;s formidable battle performance) while it is a mix of blue, red, and white. Tomino&#x27;s response in the novel version of &quot;Gundam&quot; is that the original design was to be a grayscale machine, made up of mostly white and light gray colouring. However, &quot;Sunrise&quot; disapproved of the colouring and insisted the unit to be painted in brighter colours like other super robot anime at that time.

The Japan Self-Defense Forces built an approximately full scale RX-78-3 Gundam (named after the use of helium-3 fuel) with styrofoam in its show and contains a simulation pod.

=== Variants and successors ===

* The RGM-79 GM was a mass-produced mobile suit based on the RX-78-2&#x27;s combat data and design, and spun off into its own line of mobile suits.
* The RX-78-2 Gundam is part of the RX-78 series of high-performance mobile suits, which are primarily featured in spinoff media. They were originally designed by Kunio Okawara for the &quot;Mobile Suit Variation&quot; and &quot;Missing Mobile Suit Variation&quot; series. 8 units were created, with Units 7 and 8 remaining a mystery.
** The RX-78-1 Prototype Gundam was the first Gundam-type mobile suit designed to combat the Zaku and led to the creation of the RX-78-2.
** The RX-78-3 G-3 Gundam donned a gray color scheme and used as a testbed for the magnet coating technology later used by the main unit. It makes an appearance in the novel adaption of the show.
** Units RX-78-4 Gundam Unit 4 &quot;G04&quot; and RX-78-5 Gundam Unit 5 &quot;G05&quot; were featured in the video game &quot;Encounters in Space,&quot; and are sister units that eliminate the Core Block system for increased weaponry and better performance. Unit G04 was equipped with a Mega Beam Launcher, which was unstable and destroyed the unit by overloading its energy output.
** The RX-78-6 Mudrock Gundam, featured in Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: Missing Link, was a Zeonic unit utilizing built-in weaponry as opposed to external ones such as the beam rifle.
** The RX-78-7 7th Gundam (aka RX-78-7 Gundam) featured in Mobile Suit Gundam Battlefield Record U.C. 0081
* The FA-78-1 Full Armor Gundam was an unbuilt schematic for modular weaponry and armor meant for the RX-78-2.
* The PF-78-1 Perfect Gundam was first featured in the manga Plamo-Kyoshiro and was an RX-78-2 model kit modified with over-the-top armor and a shoulder-mounted water cannon.
* The RX-78-NT1 Gundam NT-1 (nicknamed the Alex), was featured in the OVA &quot;War in the Pocket&quot;. Initially meant to be sent to Amuro as a replacement for the aging RX-78-2, it was test piloted by Christina Mackenzie and destroyed in the Side 6 space colony.
** The RX-78GP01 Gundam GP01 Zephyranthes a successor of RX-78-2 was first featured in the OVA &quot;Stardust Memory&quot;. A new Gundam-type as part GP project (Gundam Development Project)
** The RX-178 Gundam MK-II is featured as a key mobile suit in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, being piloted by protagonist Kamille Bidan in its first half and continuing to be used throughout it and &quot;Mobile Suit ZZ Gundam&quot;. Three units were produced by the Titans faction, improving on aspects of the original with technology such as a moving inner frame and a panoramic cockpit. All three units were later stolen by the Anti Earth Union Group (A.E.U.G) and one of them was given a new paint scheme while the other 2 were dismantled and studied.

=== Alternate designs ===
* A redesigned iteration of the RX-78-2 by Hajime Katoki, referred to as &quot;Ver.Ka&quot;, is featured in merchandise such as the Master Grade line of model kits and the Gundam Fix Figuration line of figures.
* A version parallel counter-part of RX-78-2 in featured manga reboot Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin same design characteristics as original, except the shoulder, leg and the body armor was remade.
* Another iteration with a sleeker design is featured in the shorts series Gundam Evolve.
* A version RX-78-2 Gundam designed by mechanical engineer Ken Okuyama is featured in Mobile Suit Gundam G40 a short film and model kit to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The design was meant to mimic realistic human movement similar to the original series.
* Gunboy-Wilbur is a &quot;Machining Skin&quot; featured in &quot;For the Barrel,&quot; a novel reinterpretation of the original series serialized in &quot;Newtype&quot; Magazine.

====gMS-α Red Gundam====
A more skeletal design created by Ikuto Yamashita for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, s&quot;et during an alternate version of the Universal Century timeline. In this incarnation, Char Aznable steals the RX-78-2 Gundam and modifies it with a red color scheme, psycommu systems, and funnel bits from the abandoned Elmeth project, allowing the Principality of Zeon to win the One Year War. While it disappeared during the final battle along with Char, it reappears in UC 0085 piloted by Shuji Ito, kickstarting the main plot.

==Other media and merchandise==

=== Pop culture ===
The RX-78-2 Gundam is one of the basic units that appear in the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series&quot;,&quot; representing the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise alongside series mainstays &quot;Mazinger&quot; and &quot;Getter Robo&quot;.

The RX-78-2 also makes multiple cameo appearances in the anime &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot;.

The RX-78-2 Gundam appeared in the film &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018), where one of the protagonists controls the RX-78-2 to battle Mechagodzilla.

On October 23, 2000, Japan included the RX-78 Gundam and Amuro Ray in the 20th Century Stamp Series. This mobile suit and other notable machines from various &quot;Gundam&quot; series were also recognized in the second set of &quot;Anime Heroes and Heroines&quot; stamps, released in 2005. Other franchises and series included were &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, and &quot;Detective Conan&quot;.

=== Promotions ===
The RX-78-2 Gundam &amp; 2 Medea transport planes were featured in a fire fighting poster in Japan. The RX-78-2 was equipped with water spraying equipment.

On July 16, 2010 to June 30, 2011, ANA launched a series of flights as part of the 30th anniversary of Gunpla. Called the &quot;ANA x GUNDAM Sky Project,&quot; the promotion used specially painted Boeing 777s on domestic and international flights. The initial flight was from Tokyo to Osaka. Promotional model kits include 1/144 scale versions of the RX-78-2, Gundam 00 Raiser, and Unicorn Gundam, as well as a 1/48 scale RX-78-2, all molded in ANA colors.

Promotional food based on the Gundam include Pocky, Pepsi, McDonalds, and Cup Noodles. Food promotions usually tie into merchandise, including exclusive model kits or miniature statues.

===Statues===

On March 23, 2008, a bronze statue of the Gundam was erected at the south entrance of Kami-Igusa Station in Suginami, Tokyo to honor the hometown animation studio Sunrise.

As part of the 30th Anniversary of the Gundam series, the company officially announced a project on March 11, 2009, called &quot;Real-G&quot; planning to build a 1:1 real size scale Gundam in Japan. It was completed on June 9, 2009, and displayed in a Tokyo park. The 18-meter tall statue was later moved and reconstructed in Shizuoka City, where it stayed from July 2010 to March 2011. This design became the basis for the Real Grade model in 2010 and the Master Grade Ver.3.0 model in 2013 and makes an appearance in &quot;Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G&quot;. In August it was dismantled and reconstructed in Odaiba, Tokyo on April 19, 2012. Until March 5, 2017, it stood in Odaiba along with a gift shop called &quot;Gundam Front Tokyo&quot;. On March 5, it was announced that the life size RX 78-2 Gundam will be replaced by a statue of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;.

A second statue based on the original Gundam was announced in late 2018 as part of the &quot;Gundam Global Challenge&quot; made to receive concepts for an animatronic version. The statue, known as the RX-78F00 Yokohama Gundam, finished construction in 2020 and opened to the public on December 19, 2020 as part of the Gundam Factory Yokohama attraction. The statue was dismantled in 2024. A rebuilt version called the F00/E will be featured in the &quot;Gundam Next Future&quot; Pavilion at Expo 2025 in Osaka. This statue will be in a fixed pose, kneeling and reaching for the sky.

Other statues include the Freedom Gundam from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; in Shanghai, China in 2021, and a statue of the Nu Gundam from &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; sporting a long range funnel weapon (dubbed the RX-93ff) in Fukuoka, Japan in 2022.

===Physical attractions===
Gundam the Ride: A Baoa Qu was a theme park attraction from Fuji-Q Highland which ran from 2000 to 2007. Visitors are escorted in a battleship by 2 GM suits during the titular battle. The ride was replaced by &quot;Gundam Crisis,&quot; where visitors explore a hangar in order to collect data to access the RX-78-2&#x27;s cockpit. If successful, an exclusive video will be shown inside the cockpit.

The statue stood in Odaiba, Tokyo, outside the shopping mall Diver City Tokyo, where it was a centerpiece of the &quot;Gundam Front Tokyo&quot; attraction until March 5, 2017. Visitors could visit the statue and also see the Gundam Front Tokyo attraction on the sixth floor of the mall, which featured a 360 degree panoramic movie theater, a room dedicated to Gundam models throughout the years, concept artwork, and a life-size 1/1 scale bust of the Strike Freedom Gundam from the show &quot;Mobile Suit&quot; &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;. The nearby hotel, Grand Nikko Tokyo Daiba (formerly Grand Pacific le Daiba) had a Gundam themed hotel room during this time.

=== Toys and model kits ===
The original line of toys produced by the show&#x27;s original sponsor Clover, diecast figures with more super robot aesthetics, clashed with the show&#x27;s themes and audience and was not a success. To capture the teenage and adult demographics, Bandai produced a line of model kits based on the Gundam and other mobile suits, which became immensely popular. the RX-78-2 Gundam has releases in virtually every model line and scale and is often used to commemorate a new model line or an anniversary.

The current Bandai Universal Century models&#x27; label copyright classification also uses the head of the Gundam as its icon.

<text>Barbara Billingsley (born Barbara Lillian Combes; December 22, 1915 – October 16, 2010) was an American actress. She began her career with uncredited roles in &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot; (1951), &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952), and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1953), and was featured in the 1957 film &quot;The Careless Years&quot; opposite Natalie Trundy. She then appeared in recurring TV roles, such as &quot;The Brothers&quot;.

Billingsley gained prominence for her best-known role of June Cleaver, the mother in the television series &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (1957–1963) and its sequel &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; (1983–1989). She appeared as the &quot;Jive Lady&quot; in &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), and her final film role was as Aunt Martha in the 1997 film version of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;.

==Early life==
Billingsley was born Barbara Lillian Combes on December 22, 1915, in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Lillian Agnes (née McLaughlin) and Robert Collyer Combes, a police officer. She had one elder sibling, Elizabeth. Her parents divorced sometime before her fourth birthday, and her father, who later became an assistant chief of police, remarried. After the divorce, Billingsley&#x27;s mother began working as a foreman at a knitting mill.

==Career==
===Early years===
After attending Los Angeles Junior College for one year, Billingsley traveled to Broadway, when &quot;Straw Hat&quot;, a revue in which she was appearing, attracted enough attention to send it to New York City. When the show closed after five days, she took an apartment on 57th Street and went to work as a $60-a-week fashion model. In 1941, she married Glenn Billingsley Sr. She landed a contract with MGM Studios in 1945, and moved with her husband to Los Angeles in 1946. That same year, Glenn Billingsley opened a steakhouse there.

She had mostly uncredited roles in major movies in the 1940s. These roles continued into the first half of the 1950s with supporting roles in &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot; (1951), opposite Jane Wyman; &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952); and the science-fiction film &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1953). In 1952, Billingsley had her first role as a guest star in an episode of &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot;.

In 1955, she won a costarring role in the sitcom &quot;Professional Father&quot;, starring Stephen Dunne and Beverly Washburn. It lasted one season. The next year, Billingsley had a recurring role in &quot;The Brothers&quot; (with Gale Gordon and Bob Sweeney) and an appearance with David Niven in his anthology series &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;. In 1957, she costarred with Dean Stockwell and Natalie Trundy in &quot;The Careless Years&quot;, her first and only major role in a film.

Billingsley had guest roles in &quot;The Pride of the Family&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, &quot;Letter to Loretta&quot;, &quot;You Are There&quot;, and &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;. She appeared on &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; on January 14, 1957, in the episode &quot;Danny&#x27;s Date&quot;, where she played Mary Rogers.

===&quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;===

Billingsley appeared on TV as June Cleaver in the sitcom &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. It debuted on CBS in 1957 to mediocre ratings. It was picked up by ABC the following year and became a hit, airing for the next five seasons, and broadcast in over 100 countries. It also starred Hugh Beaumont as Ward Cleaver, June&#x27;s husband and the kids&#x27; father, and child actors Tony Dow as Wally Cleaver and Jerry Mathers as Theodore &quot;Beaver&quot; Cleaver.

In the show, Billingsley was often seen doing household chores wearing pearls and earrings. The pearls, which were Billingsley&#x27;s trademark, were, in turn, her idea to have her alter ego wear on television. She had what she termed &quot;a hollow&quot; in her neck and thought that wearing a strand of white pearls would lighten it up for the cameras. In later seasons, she started wearing high heels to compensate for the fact that the actors playing her sons were getting taller than she was. The pearl necklace was so closely associated with the character that an entire episode of the sequel series dealt with the necklace when it was lost.

Billingsley had one regret about the show&#x27;s lasting success: In standard actors&#x27; contracts in the 1950s, residual payments ended after six re-runs and the show, subsequently considered a classic, was syndicated for the rest of her life.

Billingsley said that her character was the &quot;ideal mother&quot; during a 1997 interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;. She said that some people thought June was a weak character, but that she didn&#x27;t: &quot;She was the love in that family. She set a good example for what a wife could be. I had two boys at home when I did the show. I think the character became kind of like me and vice versa. I&#x27;ve never known where one started and where one stopped.&quot; Billingsley explained her view on the enduring appeal of the &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; characters: &quot;I think everybody would like a family like that. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if you came home from school and there was Mom standing there with her little apron and cookies waiting?&quot;

Billingsley, however, questioned her character&#x27;s reactions to the Cleaver children&#x27;s misbehavior, basing her concern on personal experience as the mother of two sons. As co-producer Joseph Connelly explained: &quot;In scenes where she&#x27;s mad at the boys, she&#x27;s always coming over to us with the script and objecting. &#x27;I don&#x27;t see why June is so mad over what Beaver&#x27;s done. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be.&#x27; As a result, many of Beaver&#x27;s crimes have been rewritten into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack.&quot;

After six seasons and 234 episodes, the series was canceled because of the cast&#x27;s desire to move on to other projects, especially Mathers, who retired from acting to enter his freshman year in high school. The younger actor considered Billingsley a mentor, a second mother, and a close professional friend: 

===After &quot;Beaver&quot;===
When production of the show ended in 1963, Billingsley had become typecast and had trouble obtaining acting jobs for years. She traveled extensively abroad until the late 1970s. After an absence of 17 years from the public eye (other than appearing in two episodes of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; in 1971), she spoofed her wholesome image with a brief appearance in the comedy &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) as a passenger who could &quot;speak jive.&quot; She said the role gave her as much publicity as &quot;Beaver&quot; and revived her career.

Returning to TV, she appeared on episodes of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In 1983 she reprised her role as June Cleaver in the &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; television movie titled &quot;Still the Beaver&quot; in 1983. Hugh Beaumont had died the previous year of a heart attack, so she played his widow. She also appeared in the revival of the series &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; from 1985 to 1989. During the run of &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot;, Billingsley became the voice of Nanny on &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; from 1984 to 1991. For her performance as Nanny, she was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Series in 1989 and 1990.

After &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; ended its run in 1989, Billingsley appeared in guest roles on &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Empty Nest&quot;, and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. She also reprised her role as June Cleaver in various television shows, including &quot;Elvira&#x27;s Movie Macabre&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Baby Boom&quot;, &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home!&quot;, and &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In 1998, she appeared on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, with June Lockhart and Isabel Sanford, as audience members in a spoof seminar on motherhood. Billingsley&#x27;s final film role was as Aunt Martha in the 1997 film version of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;. She made her final onscreen appearance in the 2003 television movie &quot;Secret Santa&quot;.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1963, Mathers remained her close friend. They were reunited on &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot;. Billingsley, Mathers, Dow, Frank Bank, and Ken Osmond celebrated the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary together on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

==Personal life==
Billingsley was married three times and had two children. In 1941 she married Glenn Billingsley Sr., a restaurateur and a nephew of Sherman Billingsley, owner of the Stork Club. His businesses included Billingsley&#x27;s Golden Bull, Billingsley&#x27;s Bocage, the Outrigger Polynesian restaurants in Los Angeles, and a Stork Club in Key West, Florida, where they lived briefly after their wedding. They had two sons and divorced in 1947.

In 1953 she married British-born movie director Roy Kellino. Their marriage lasted three years, when in 1956 he died of a heart attack at age 44. It was about six months later that she was handed the pilot for what would become &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (then titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;). Billingsley&#x27;s third and final marriage was to William S. Mortensen in 1959; they remained together until his death in 1981.

==Death==
Billingsley died of polymyalgia rheumatica at her home in Santa Monica, California, on October 16, 2010, at the age of 94. She is interred at Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica.

<text>Thomas Playford (26 November 1837 – 19 April 1915) was an Australian politician who served two terms as Premier of South Australia (1887–1889; 1890–1892). He subsequently entered federal politics, serving as a Senator for South Australia from 1901 to 1906 and as Minister for Defence from 1905 to 1907.

==Early life==
Born in Bethnal Green, London in 1837, Thomas Playford II moved to Adelaide in 1844 with his parents the Rev. Thomas Playford (c. 1795 – 18 September 1873) and his wife Mary Anne Playford, née Perry (c. 1804 – 27 April 1872), two brothers and a sister. He worked as a farmer prior to entering politics.

==South Australian politics==
Elected to the Parliament of South Australia at the 1868 election as the Member for Onkaparinga, he gained the sobriquet &quot;Honest Tom&quot; for his forthright and straightforward manner, although these same qualities would earn him the occasional disapproval of fellow politicians and the electorate, such as the remark in parliament &quot;stinkwort and Emil Wentzel were weeds that have come from Germany&quot;, a remark that contributed to his defeat at the 1871 election. Playford returned to Parliament at the 1875 election as member for East Torrens and held the position of Reforming Commissioner for Crown Lands and Immigration before losing his seat yet again at the 1887 election. A month later however, he won the seat of Newcastle. By mid-1887 he became Premier and Treasurer, positions he would hold for two years until a vote of no confidence passed. During his premiership, his most important achievement was considered to be the implementation of the first systematic tariff system for South Australia.

He regained East Torrens at the 1890 election and a few months later he formed his second government, again becoming Premier and Treasurer, and would again last for two years. He received kudos for significantly reducing the colony&#x27;s debt, although he spent much of this second term in India. Charles Kingston brought together the various &#x27;liberal&#x27; groups and was able to defeat the conservative John Downer government at the 1893 election with Labor support. The Kingston government would last for a then-record six years. Kingston had appointed Playford as Treasurer in his government, however in 1894 Playford moved to London to act as Agent-General for South Australia before returning to South Australia in 1898 to serve in Kingston&#x27;s government from the 1899 election as member for Gumeracha, until he crossed the floor in later that year over a potential erosion of the power of the Legislative Council, bringing down the Kingston government in the process. He also found the time to involve himself in the planning of the Federation of the Australian Commonwealth and drafting the Australian Constitution. As part of this, he proposed the title &quot;Commonwealth of Australia&quot;.

==Federal politics==

As a moderate Protectionist, but with the endorsement of the conservative Australasian National League (formerly National Defence League), Playford became a Senator at the inaugural 1901 federal election. Two years later in Alfred Deakin&#x27;s government, Playford served for seven months as Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council. He became Minister for Defence in 1905 which he held for 18 months. He was defeated in the 1906 federal election, the first serving Minister to suffer this fate. His term as a Senator ended on 31 December 1906, and his ministerial commission was terminated on 24 January 1907. Playford made one further unsuccessful attempt to re-enter the Senate at the 1910 federal election.

==Death==
Playford died in Kent Town, Adelaide on 19 April 1915.

==Family==
Playford married Mary Jane Kinsman (born 20 May 1835, the daughter of Rev. William Kinsman) on 16 December 1860. The couple had eleven children: five sons, five daughters and one adoptive daughter.

His eldest daughter Annie (died 1956) married the Rev. John Henry Sexton on 30 June 1886.

On 1 January 1889 his second daughter Eliza (born 1866) married Harry J. Tuck (born 1863), elder brother of painter Marie Tuck and later headmaster at Unley High School.

Playford&#x27;s grandson, Sir Thomas Playford, also served as Premier of South Australia.

<text>Fernelius is a lunar impact crater located in the southern highlands just to the north of the walled plain Stöfler. It was named after 16th century French astronomer Jean Fernel. The crater Kaiser is located next to the northwest rim of Fernelius. To the north-northwest are the craters Nonius and Walther. Southeast of Fernelius is the crater cluster of Miller, Nasireddin, Huggins, and Orontius.

In the past the floor of Fernelius has been resurfaced, leaving a relatively flat, featureless surface with no central peaks. The crater rim has been heavily worn and indented by impacts, the most prominent being Fernelius A which intrudes into the western rim.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fernelius.

<text>A foreword is a (usually short) piece of writing, sometimes placed at the beginning of a book or other piece of literature. Typically written by someone other than the primary author of the work, it often tells of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the book&#x27;s primary author or the story the book tells. Later editions of a book sometimes have a new foreword prepended (appearing before an older foreword if there was one), which might explain in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.

When written by the author, the foreword may cover the story of how the book came into being or how the idea for the book was developed, and may include thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing. Unlike a preface, a foreword is always signed.

Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an introduction, rather than in the foreword or like preface.

The pages containing the foreword and preface (and other front matter) are typically not numbered as part of the main work, which usually uses Arabic numerals. If the front matter is paginated, it uses lowercase Roman numerals. If there is both a foreword and a preface, the foreword appears first; both appear before the introduction, which may be paginated either with the front matter or the main text.

The word &quot;foreword&quot; was first used around the mid-17th century, originally as a term in philology. It was possibly a calque of German &quot;Vorwort&quot;, itself a calque of Latin &quot;praefatio&quot;.

<text>Gay-Lussac is a lunar impact crater located to the north of the prominent crater Copernicus, in the southern foothills of the Montes Carpatus range. The rim of the crater is slightly distorted, although generally circular. The inner floor is flat but rough, with no central peak. There are a pair of small craterlet depressions in the middle instead of a central peak. The associated crater Gay-Lussac A is nearly joined to the southeast rim.

The crater is named after French physicist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac.

To the southwest is a wide rille named Rima Gay-Lussac. This is a nearly linear formation with curves at the end. It follows a 40-km-long line from the southwest to the northeast.

<doc id="983793" wikidata="Q1958739" url="?curid=983793" title="Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome">
<text>Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is the presence of Müllerian duct derivatives (fallopian tubes, uterus, and/or the upper part of the vagina) in what would be considered a genetically and otherwise physically normal male. In humans, PMDS typically is due to an autosomal recessive congenital disorder and is considered by some to be a form of pseudohermaphroditism due to the presence of Müllerian derivatives. PMDS can also present in non-human animals.

Typical features include undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and the presence of a small, underdeveloped uterus in an XY infant or adult. This condition is usually caused by deficiency of fetal anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) effect due to mutations of the gene for AMH or the anti-Müllerian hormone receptor, but may also be as a result of insensitivity to AMH of the target organ.

==Presentation==
The first visible signs of PMDS after birth is cryptorchidism (undescended testes) either unilaterally or bilaterally, as well as inguinal hernias. Adults who have been oblivious to this condition may present with haematuria, which is when blood appears in urine because of hormonal imbalances. PMDS Type I is also referred to as hernia uteri inguinalis, which exhibits one descended testis that has also pulled the fallopian tube, and sometimes uterus, through the inguinal canal. The descended testes, fallopian tube and uterus all fall in the same inguinal canal, causing an inguinal hernia. When the aforementioned conditions occur together, it is called transverse testicular ectopia.

Under the microscope, some samples taken for biopsies displayed results where testicular tissue was at a stage of immaturity and showed dysplasia.

==Genetics==
Mutation in AMH gene (PMDS Type 1) or AMHR2 gene (PMDS Type 2) are the primary causes of PMDS. AMH, or sometimes referred to as Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS), is secreted by Sertoli cells during an individual&#x27;s whole life. It is essential during the foetal period as it functions to regress the Müllerian ducts. However, AMH also functions in the last trimester of pregnancy, after birth, and even during adulthood in minimal amounts. The Sertoli cells in males secrete AMH, through the presence of a Y chromosome.

The role of the &quot;AMH&quot; gene in reproductive development, is the production of a protein that contributes to male sex differentiation. During development of male foetuses, the AMH protein is secreted by cells within the testes. AMHs bind to the AMH Type 2 Receptors, which are present on cells on the surface of the Müllerian duct. The binding of AMH to its receptors on the Müllerian duct induces the apoptosis of the Müllerian duct cells, thus the regression of the Müllerian duct within males. However, for females who originally do not produce AMH proteins during foetal development, the Müllerian duct eventually becomes the uterus and fallopian tubes as normal. With the AMH gene mutation (PMDS Type 1), the AMH is either not produced, produced in deficient amounts, defective, or secreted at the wrong critical period for male differentiation.

AMHR2 contains the instructions for generating the receptors that AMH binds to. If there is a mutation in the AMHR2 gene, the response to AMH molecules binding to the receptor cannot be properly reciprocated. Other possibilities include an absence of the receptors, such that the AMH molecules cannot induce differentiation. Mutation in the AMHR2 is critical to proper male sex differentiation. The genetic mutational cause of PMDS, is a 27 base-pair deletion of the Anti-Müllerian Type 2 Receptor gene. The 27-base-pair deletion that occurs PMDS is in exon 10 on one allele. With the AMHR2 gene mutation (PMDS Type 2), the AMHR2 is either not produced, produced in deficient amounts, defective, or the Müllerian ducts manifested a resistance to AMH.

PMDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The male individuals inherit mutated copies of the X chromosomes from the maternal and paternal genes, implying the parents are carriers and do not show symptoms. Females inheriting two mutated genes do not display symptoms of PMDS, though remain as carriers. Males are affected genotypically with the karyotype (46, XY) and phenotypically.

==Diagnosis==
Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS), also known as persistent oviduct syndrome, is a congenital disorder related to male sexual development. PMDS usually affects phenotypically normal male individuals with the karyotype (46, XY) and is a form of pseudohermaphroditism.

The condition occurs in males and consists of normal-functioning reproductive organs and gonads, but also female reproductive organs such as the uterus and the fallopian tubes. The fetus has two sets of tubes which give rise to accessory reproductive organs - the (Wolffian) mesonephric ducts and the (Müllerian) paramesonephric ducts. Usually, the Wolffian duct gives rise to male reproductive organs (specifically the testicle, epididymis and vas deferens) while the Müllerian to female (the fallopian tubes, the uterus and the vagina), while the other duct regresses. In PMDS, an abnormality in the anti-Müllerian hormone signaling pathway causes the in-males-redundant Müllerian duct to persist and give rise to variously developed female reproductive organs.

PMDS has various causes related to AMH or receptor abnormalities. For example, AMH has failed to synthesize, failed to release or was secreted at the wrong time. Normally, both the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts are present during the 7th week of gestation. At approximately the end of the 7th and the beginning of the 8th week of gestation, the Sertoli cell&#x27;s secretion of AMH occurs, causing male sex differentiation during fetal development. The AMH molecules bind to AMHRII (anti-Müllerian hormone receptor type II) regressing the Müllerian duct. The Leydig cells secrete testosterone to aid the male differentiation process by inducing structures such as the epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles. However, with PMDS individuals, the Müllerian duct persists instead of regressing, either due to AMH secretion (PMDS Type I) or AMH receptors (PMDS Type II). PMDS is usually coincidentally found during surgery for inguinal hernia, or when searching for adult male infertility causes.

=== Other diagnostic tests ===

==== Genetic ====
Another method for the confirmation of PMDS is genetic testing. It is not usually preferred because of its processing period and cost. With image screenings such as ultrasound and MRI, the condition can be efficiently confirmed. Genetic tests can identify those who hold the mutated gene, identify the family member&#x27;s chances and risks, and advise those who are trying to get pregnant. Genetic counseling and further genetic testing is offered to confirm the chances and risks of an individual&#x27;s offspring obtaining the pair of mutated genes. Further research into the family tree and inheritance is possible as well.

==== ELISA ====
An ELISA test is a form of immunoassay, a technique which uses an antibody or antigen to identify the presence of particular substances. For PMDS, ELISA tests can be used to determine the levels of AMH within the male individual&#x27;s serum, but this is only effective before the individual reaches puberty as it normally increases during this period. PMDS patients display low levels of AMH within the serum, and low levels of testosterone.

==Treatment==
The main form of treatment is laparotomy, a modern and minimally invasive type of surgery. Laparotomy properly positions the testes within the scrotum (orchidopexy) and removes Müllerian structures, the uterus, and fallopian tubes. Occasionally they are unsalvageable if located high in the retroperitoneum. During this surgery, the uterus is usually removed and attempts made to dissect away Müllerian tissue from the vas deferens and epididymis to improve the chance of fertility. If the person has male gender identity and the testes cannot be retrieved, testosterone replacement will usually be necessary at puberty should the affected individual choose to pursue medical attention. Recently, laparoscopic hysterectomy is offered to patients as a solution to both improve the chances of fertility and to prevent the occurrence of neoplastic tissue formation. Having a target age for surgery reduces the risks of damaging the vas deferens. The vas deferens is in close proximity to the Müllerian structures, and is sometimes lodged in the uterine wall.

PMDS patients have a possibility of infertility in the future if not promptly operated on. When the affected males are adults, those who are not aware of the condition may find the presence of blood in their semen (hematospermia). The Müllerian structures and cryptorchidism can also develop into cancer, although rare. If PMDS is found during adulthood, or if Müllerian structures had to be left behind due to risks in surgery, biopsies of the remaining Müllerian structures can be performed. Upon pathohistological observation, the endometrial tissues appear atrophied, and the fallopian tubes have begun to congest showing signs of fibrosis.
== Epidemiology ==
PMDS is a relatively rare congenital condition. From current data, approximately 45% of the known cases are caused by mutations in the AMH gene, being a mutation on chromosome 19 (Type I PMDS). Approximately, 40% are AMHR2 mutations, on the AMH receptor type 2 gene, which is on chromosome 12 (Type 2 PMDS). The remaining unknown 15% are referred to as idiopathic PMDS.

== Case studies ==
Especially before the 21st century, these conditions were hard to diagnose due to the lack of modern imaging capabilities. For this reason, the older population, or those in poorer countries found out later. PMDS was usually overlooked because the external symptoms, such as the cryptorchidism and inguinal hernias, were assumed to be the only complication.

A case reported in 2013, involves a 50-year-old male with a history of low testosterone levels, high cholesterol and the congenital absence of his right testis. Imaging revealed that the patient had three cystic masses, with structures similar to the uterus and ovaries, thus PMDS. During the operation, the surgeons found malignant degeneration of the Müllerian remnants which occurs if PMDS is unnoticed for a long period of time. The cause of the complications presented in the male patient was due to the unidentified bilateral cryptorchidism since birth, as doctors at that time assumed the complication was just the &quot;congenital absence of his right testis&quot;. Overlooking the symptoms of PDMS can cause permanent negative effects such as infertility and future malignancies, as shown by this male patient. The malignant degeneration of the Müllerian structures is supportive evidence for the cause of the male patient&#x27;s infertility.

<doc id="983797" wikidata="Q1571682" url="?curid=983797" title="Halley (lunar crater)">
<text>Halley is a lunar impact crater that is intruding into the southern wall of the walled plain Hipparchus. Its diameter is 35 km. The crater is named after the English astronomer Edmond Halley. On the 1645 map by Michael van Langren, the crater is called &quot;Gansii&quot;, for the &quot;gansa&quot; (a kind of wild swan) of Francis Godwin″s &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;. To the southwest of Halley is the large crater Albategnius, and due east lies the slightly smaller Hind.

The rim of Halley is somewhat worn, the east being scoured by debris from the Imbrium basin, hence forming part of the Imbrium Sculpture. The interior floor of Halley is relatively flat, being filled with material of the same albedo of the surrounding terrain, and is probably melt from the Imbrium impact.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Halley.

<doc id="983799" wikidata="Q4816059" url="?curid=983799" title="Atlanta Cyclorama &amp; Civil War Museum">
<text>The Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum was a Civil War museum located in Atlanta, Georgia. Its most noted attraction was the Atlanta Cyclorama, a cylindrical panoramic painting of the Battle of Atlanta. As of December 2021, the Cyclorama is located at the Atlanta History Center, while the building is now Zoo Atlanta&#x27;s Savanna Hall.

==History==
The painting was created as a traveling attraction for Northerners; it portrayed celebrated Union officers, while the portrayals of Confederate officers were not individualized. It was purchased and moved to Atlanta in 1891 by Paul Atkinson, who attempted to recast the Battle of Atlanta as a Confederate victory, repainting a group of Confederate prisoners of war so they became defeated Union soldiers.

Paying visitors viewed the cylindrical painting from the inside, entering through an entrance in the floor. After being seated, the central cylinder rotates slowly, affording a view of the entire painting. The painting at one time was the largest oil painting in the world, and if unrolled would measure high by long, weighing 10,000 pounds. It held this record until 1894, when it was surpassed in size by the &quot;Racławice Panorama&quot; (15 × 114 meter, 49 ft × 374 ft) a cycloramic painting depicting the Battle of Racławice.

The Cyclorama was narrated at one time by volunteers, some of whom were veterans or widows of veterans of the Civil War. In 1960, Atlanta Mayor William B. Hartsfield accepted the donation of a recorded narration written by Junius Andrew Park Jr., in honor of his father, Junius Andrew Park Sr., who was born and raised in Atlanta. Research was done by Lurline Richardson Park, the writer&#x27;s wife. The narration was musically scored by Atlanta musician Sam T. Wilhoit, and the narration was read by Hollywood actor Victor Jory, who appeared in the original motion picture &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. All parties donated their time and labor. In later years, a revised narration was produced and narrated by actor Shepperd Strudwick.

==Civil War museum==

The museum displayed pictures and artifacts from the Civil War, including the &quot;Texas&quot;, a steam locomotive that pursued the captured train the &quot;General&quot; in the Great Locomotive Chase during the war. This raid was depicted in the 1927 Buster Keaton film &quot;The General&quot; and the 1956 Disney film &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;.

A movie theater inside the museum showed a short film about the Atlanta Campaign to visitors before they viewed the painting. The 14-minute film was called &quot;The Atlanta Campaign&quot;, and was directed by and narrated by James Earl Jones. It originally premiered on May 9, 1990 and had a budget of $300,000, including a 24-foot scale model of Atlanta and a cast of 5,000 reenactors. Many of the reenactors also appeared in the 1989 film, &quot;Glory&quot;.

The Cyclorama painting itself is augmented by a three-dimensional diorama in front of the painting and a narration of the events of the battle and the history of the painting. A popular story concerning the diorama involves actor Clark Gable. During the celebrations surrounding the opening of the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the film&#x27;s actors visited the Atlanta Cyclorama. Gable allegedly claimed that the only way the painting could be any more magnificent was if he were in it, prompting the management to add Gable&#x27;s features to one of the sculptures in the diorama, that of a dying soldier.

==Relocation==
In July 2014, Atlanta city officials announced plans to relocate the Cyclorama to the Atlanta History Center in Buckhead. The possibility of a move started soon after the 2008 restoration of the only other panoramic painting in the United States, the &quot;Gettysburg Cyclorama&quot;. In 2011, a panel of city leaders and historians was appointed to investigate options for restoring and possibly relocating the painting, which was estimated to cost at least $8 million to restore. Three options were considered: relocate to the Centennial Olympic Park area, near the Georgia Aquarium and other new tourist attractions; relocate to the Atlanta History Center; or, remain in the current location. The Atlanta History Center was selected after a local couple offered $10 million towards the project, with the History Center noting in its announcement that it had already raised $32.2 million for the move. Including the $10 million endowment, ultimately a total of $35.78 million was raised.

The Cyclorama&#x27;s final day open to the public was June 30, 2015, after which it closed in preparation for the move. The History Center began construction in fall 2015 on a new building to house the painting, the diorama and the &quot;Texas&quot; locomotive. During the construction, restoration work was done on the painting, including the addition of areas of the painting that were removed prior to its installation in the current Grant Park facility. After the History Center building was completed, the painting and diorama were to be moved to the new facility where restoration continued, at times in view of History Center visitors. The building in Grant Park was given to Zoo Atlanta, which planned to use it as office and event space, including a new private viewing area for a proposed expansion of the zoo&#x27;s African elephant habitat.

The restored Cyclorama reopened in April 2019.

<text>Hind is a lunar impact crater that lies to the southeast of the walled plain Hipparchus, and due east of the crater Halley. Its diameter is 29 km. It was named after British astronomer John Russell Hind. The rim of Hind is relatively free of wear and distortion, except for a break at the north rim. The floor of Hind is relatively uneven, however, compared to the interior of Halley. Hind and the craters Hipparchus C and Hipparchus L form a line with diminishing diameters that point to the northeast.

<text>Horrocks is a lunar impact crater located entirely within the eroded northeast rim of the much larger walled plain Hipparchus. Its diameter is . It was named after the 17th-century English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks. To the south of Horrocks are the craters Halley and Hind, Rhaeticus is to the north, and Pickering to the northeast. Gyldén and Saunder lie to the west and east, respectively.

The rim of Horrocks is somewhat irregular and polygonal, particularly with an outward protrusion on the eastern rim. It has a small outer ridge. The inner wall is slumped, particularly along the northwest where it forms a heap of talus. The interior floor is uneven, and it has a central mountain and hills. The crater is approximately in diameter and deep. It is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

<text>Seoul Subway Line 1 (dubbed &quot;The Dark Blue Line&quot;) of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway is a rapid transit and commuter rail line which links central Seoul, South Korea to Yeoncheon in the northeast, Incheon in the southwest, and Sinchang via Suwon and Cheonan in the south. The central underground portion of Line 1, running underneath Sejongno, Jongno, and Wangsan-ro avenues along Seoul&#x27;s traditional downtown area, is the oldest subway-operated section in the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system. Its branches and services cover a large part of the Seoul Metropolitan Area; totaling in route length.

The underground section between Seoul station and Cheongnyangni station, which is referred to as Seoul Metro Line 1 () after its operator, is currently operated by Seoul Metro, and is electrified at the subway standard of 1.5 kV DC. The line first opened in 1974 as the Korean National Railroad of Seoul with through services to newly-electrified (at the mainline KNR standard of 25 kV AC 60 Hz) national mainline railways from Seongbuk station (now: Kwangwoon University station) to Incheon and Suwon stations. This was the first electrified rapid transit line and service in South Korea and the second in the Korean Peninsula after the Pyongyang Metro in North Korea opened the year before.

Frequent service is provided between Soyosan, Dongducheon, Uijeongbu, Cheongnyangni, Seoul, Yongsan, and Guro, where trains split between Incheon in the west and Byeongjeom and Cheonan in the south. Express trains operate from Yongsan and Seoul stations to Dongincheon and Sinchang stations. Trains run every 3-6 min in the central route between Seoul Station and Cheongnyangni, every 6-9 min between Seoul and Guro, every 8-10 min between Guro and Incheon and between Guro and Byeongjeom, every 10-15 min from Byeongjeom to Cheonan, and every 35 min between Cheonan and Sinchang and service up to the Dongducheon area and Soyosan station.

Service to Yeoncheon is approximately once per hour, limited due to the single track section approaching Soyosan station. This service is meant to be the replacement for the Gyeongwon line commuter trains, which began at Dongducheon station prior to its closure. 

Trains travel along Gyeongbu (Seoul-Cheonan), Gyeongin (Guro-Incheon), Janghang (Cheonan-Sinchang), and Gyeongwon (Hoegi-Yeoncheon) railway lines. The line runs on the left-hand side of the track, as opposed to the right-hand side of the track like all other Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines (another exception to this is Seoul Subway Line 4 although it runs on the right-hand side until Namtaeryeong station, and operates on the left-hand side for the parts afterwards) since railways in Korea generally run on the left side.

== Rapid (Express) trains ==
Korail operates a variety of express &quot;rapid&quot; (Korean: 급행 &quot;geup-haeng&quot;, Hanja: 急行) trains for long distance commuter services on Line 1. These services include:
* Gyeongin line express services from Yongsan to Dongincheon, operating express between Guro and Dongincheon, including:
** Regular express services, introduced on January 29, 1999, following quadruple-tracking of the Gyeongin Line.
** Faster limited express (Korean: 특급 &quot;teuk-geup&quot;, Hanja: 特急) trains, introduced on July 7, 2017.
* Gyeongbu line express services from Cheongnyangni to Cheonan or Sinchang, operating express between Gasan Digital Complex and Cheonan and running local elsewhere.
* Green Gyeongbu line express service from Seoul Station to Cheonan or Sinchang, originating at a platform adjacent to Seoul Station, skipping all stations between Seoul station and Geumcheon-gu Office station, making intermediate stops at Anyang, Gunpo, Uiwang, and Sungkyunkwan University, and then following the red Gyeongbu line express service pattern south of Suwon. Northbound services (departing from Cheonan/Sinchang and terminating at Seoul Station) stop at Yeongdeungpo station, but southbound services are unable to due to the lack of a raised platform. This service was introduced on September 25, 1982.
* Gyeongwon line express services from Dongducheon to Incheon, operating express between Dongducheon and Kwangwoon University and running local between Incheon and Kwangwoon University.

Former express services include:
* One late night Gyeongin line express service that originated at Soyosan, made all stops to Guro, then made express stops until Incheon.
* Yeongdeungpo-Byeongjeom Gyeongbu line express service, skipping all stations between Yeongdeungpo and Anyang and then following the Yeongsan-Cheonan/Sinchang express service pattern south of Anyang until Byeongjeom. This service was introduced on August 25, 2014 and was discontinued on December 9, 2016.
* Two faster Yongsan-Sinchang limited express trains (one in each direction), introduced in 2013. This train only operated on weekends and holidays. It was discontinued on July 1, 2018.

== Electrification ==
Seoul Subway Line 1 is powered by 1500 V direct current on the underground tunnel segment between Cheongnyangni station and Seoul station, and by 25000 V alternating current (60 Hertz frequency) on the rest of the line. Underground DC system was implemented in order to prevent possible telecommunication malfunction by AC current on telephone lines, following the opposition from the Ministry of Postal Service (currently Ministry of Science and ICT). Because of this different manner of offering electric current, there are neutral sections between Cheongnyangni station and Hoegi station, as well as between Seoul Station and Namyeong station. All Line 1 rolling stock are similarly required to be multi-system compatible with both electrification systems.

== Stations ==
Until 2000, the underground city-center portion run by Seoul Metro Corporation—one of Seoul Metro&#x27;s predecessors—was the only section properly referred to as Line 1 and labeled red on maps. On the other hand, the remaining sections of the rail line run by Korail were referred to as Korean National Railroad of Seoul and the local all-stop services labeled either blue or gray on maps, while the express services were labelled thin red. Since 2000, all adjacent through-running Korail services from the Gyeongbu, Gyeongin and Gyeongwon Lines, as well as later Korail-operated extensions and branches, are officially bundled together with the aforementioned underground portion as part of a greater Line 1, and the labeling on maps was changed and standardized to the current dark blue color (as illustrated in the map below); also to avoid confusion with Line 4&#x27;s light blue color. (A slightly different shade of red is now used to label the Shinbundang Line which opened in 2011.)

<text>Ma On Shan Country Park () is a park located in the central neck of the Sai Kung Peninsula in the eastern New Territories of Hong Kong. The park covers an area of and links Sai Kung Country Park and Lion Rock Country Park to form an extensive recreation area on the Ma On Shan massif.

==History==
The country park was established on 27 April 1979.

In 1998, Ma On Shan Country Park was reduced in size by around near Nai Chung in order to accommodate the widening of Sai Sha Road. The revised park boundary came into effect on 18 December 1998.

==Sightseeing==
Apart from a separate section of the park on the Pak Sha Wan Peninsula, much of Ma On Shan Country Park is inland. Distant vistas of the sea and off-shore islands open up from many of the high vantage points within the park&#x27;s boundaries, but most of the exploring keeps you far from the coast.

==Mountains==
Mountains within Ma On Shan Country Park include Buffalo Hill and West Buffalo Hill, Cheung Shan, Kowloon Peak, Luk Chau Shan, Ma On Shan, Nui Po Shan, Pyramid Hill, Shek Nga Shan, Tate&#x27;s Cairn, The Hunch Backs, Tiu Shau Ngam. The Ngong Ping plateau is also locateau within the park.

==Iron mine of Ma On Shan==
Iron mining had long been carried out at Ma On Shan. The lease of the Ma On Shan Iron Mine expired in 1981 and the mine closed subsequently.

==Vegetation==
Most of these hills are somewhat bare in terms of vegetation. Their inaccessibility made it uneconomic to carry out afforestation when tree planting was necessary for fuel supply; the mainly volcanic slopes are inhospitable to all but the hardiest plants. Nevertheless, some unusual pockets of vegetation have survived over the years and even the ruined slopes of Ma On Shan are notable for their wild rhododendron, orchids and some unusual ferns.

==Wildlife==
The secluded and unspoilt surroundings have fostered a range of wildlife within the park. Pangolin, barking deer, porcupine and wild boar are still seen from time to time.

==Hiking trails== 
* Ma On Shan Country Trail - From Ma On Shan Village to Tai Shui Tseng via Ngong Ping.
* Wilson Trail - Stage 4 is from Tseng Lan Shue to Sha Tin Pass via Tai Lo Au.
* MacLehose Trail - Stage 4 and 5, starting from Kei Ling Ha to Tate&#x27;s Cairn (Gilwell Campsite) and then to Tai Po Road via Sha Tin Pass.

<text>König is a lunar impact crater on the southwest Mare Nubium. It was named after Austrian mathematician and astronomer Rudolf König. It lies to the southwest of the prominent crater Bullialdus, and northwest of the flooded Kies. The rim of König is somewhat polygonal in outline, with a small outward bulge to the south and only a slight outer . The crater interior is rough and irregular, with a negligible central peak. The material along the inner sides has slumped to the floor forming a ring of debris around the small central floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to König.

<text>The Sai Kung Peninsula () is a peninsula in the easternmost part of the New Territories in Hong Kong. Its name comes from Sai Kung Town in the central southern area of the peninsula. The southern part of the peninsula is administered by Sai Kung District, the north by Tai Po District and the northwest by Sha Tin District.

==Description==
The vast land and sea area of the peninsula remains untouched by urbanisation, and it is mostly covered by country parks. The marine ecosystem in Hoi Ha Wan is protected by law. Sai Kung is also a popular place for hiking. The starting point for the MacLehose Trail is at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung.

There are also water sports sites along the shoreline offering kayaking, snorkelling and swimming among other activities. In addition, Sai Kung&#x27;s Hoi Ha Wan () is one of the most easily accessed coral dive sites in Hong Kong. It is suitable for diver training and for newly certified divers.

As a former fishing village, Sai Kung Town is a prime attraction for seafood lovers, locals and tourists alike. Visitors can stroll around the regional market center of Sai Kung Town or explore the back lanes, visit the Tin Hau Temple, feast on seafood or enjoy different delicacies at Western-style pubs and restaurants. There is also a famous dessert restaurant called Honeymoon Dessert that brings in many visitors from all over Hong Kong and even from abroad.

In the northern Sai Kung Peninsula, there is also an area called Wong Shek. There are places where people can barbecue and enjoy the view of the sea. However, to protect the natural environment of Wong Shek, the Government controls the number of vehicle entering the area. There is a gate at Pak Tam Chung on the way towards Wong Shek, only allowing vehicles with permits to go through.

Off the coast of the Sai Kung Peninsula, there are many outlying islands. On summer nights, many people hire small boats known as &quot;kai-tos&quot; or &quot;sampans&quot; to have leisurely trips through the island-dotted inland sea of Port Shelter. Popular islands to visit include:

*Kau Sai Chau
*Sharp Island (Kiu Tsui Chau)
*High Island (Leung Shuen Wan Chau)
*Pak Sha Chau (lit. white sand island)
*Yeung Chau (lit. sheep island)
*Yim Tin Tsai (lit. little salt field)

Although Wong Shek and Hoi Ha Wan are geographically in the northern part of Sai Kung Peninsula, they are under the administration of Tai Po District, due to their reliance on ferry transport from Tai Po for access before the construction of Sai Sha Road.

==History==
From about the 14th century, fishing communities lived on boats in sheltered inlets on the peninsula. They later founded small coastal villages, building temples in honour of Tin Hau and Hung Shing in places of permanent anchorage. In addition to coastal fishing, there were small supporting industries of salt-making and boat building.

Agricultural settlements began later and several villages already existed by the year 1660. Economic development began in the middle of the 19th century when Hong Kong was opened as a port. There was especially a prosperous kiln industry producing lime, bricks and tiles for supply Hong Kong during the early days. Sheung Yiu Village, once opened as a Folk Museum, was a good example of a fortified settlement well known for lime-making in those days.

Until 1970, the part of Sai Kung beyond Tai Mong Tsai was still remote, reachable only on foot or by &quot;kai-tos&quot; (local ferry). However work started in 1971 to create the High Island Reservoir, with a capacity of , by closing off both ends of the Kwun Mun Channel which separated the High Island from the main peninsula. In 1979, the project was completed, providing also two new roads to the area. Since then, the city people can reach this relatively unspoilt area for recreation.

==Geology==

The Sai Kung Peninsula and the islands near the coast are composed almost entirely of volcanic materials. Coarse tuffs are found in the northern and south-western parts of the Peninsula and Tap Mun area. Pyroclastic rocks with some lava are found in the eastern part of the Sharp Peak and Sham Chung areas. Acid lavas are found in the area surrounding the High Island Reservoir and the south islands such as Kau Sai Chau, Tiu Chung Chau and Basalt Island, banded acid lava with some welded tuffs are found in the central and southern shore of Pak Tam Chung area.

The most spectacular of all are the hexagonal columnar joints which are found near the east dam of the High Island Reservoir and Po Pin Chau area. They are the results of the uniform cooling of tuff. This natural landscape is complemented by the nearby gigantic water works.

Along the south-eastern coast and on the offshore islands that are exposed to the easterly winds and sea waves, interesting landforms such as sea caves, stacks, arches and inlets add to the beauty of the natural landscape.

==Vegetation==
Grassland generally covers the hilltops, and across the Peninsula, there is an overall gradient from the grassland in the east to the woodland in the west.

Grassland species are predominantly minireed, duck-beak grass and false staghorn fern. Shrubs cloth the lower slopes and species for &quot;Melastoma&quot;, &quot;Rhodomyrtus&quot;, &quot;Baeckea&quot;, &quot;Eurya&quot; and &quot;Gordonia&quot; are commonly found.

Natural woodland, often in strips along the valleys or as patches behind villages are rich in native species of &quot;Machilus&quot;, &quot;Litsea&quot;, &quot;Sapium&quot;, &quot;Ficus&quot;, &quot;Sterculia&quot; and &quot;Heptapleurum&quot;.

Forest plantations, the result of both direct government planting and government-assisted village planting in the 1950s cover the hillslopes, are mostly in the western part of the Peninsula. Chinese red pine was the most important species planted and many of these old pines are now approaching senility and suffer from nematode attack. Fortunately the under-storey native broad-leafed trees are growing up to take their place.

The long and irregular coastline of the Peninsula also presents a wide variety of sea shore conditions for specialised and interesting plant communities to develop.

==Wildlife==
The grassy hillside of Sai Kung Peninsula have few birds. Around the picnic and barbecue sites, crested mynah and Eurasian tree sparrow may be seen feeding on scraps of left-over food. In patches of shrubs, Chinese bulbul can commonly be seen feeding on berries. In the densely wooded areas species such as greater coucal, great tit and Oriental magpie nest. The old fung shui woods are particularly attractive to winter visitors such as thrushes which migrate to Hong Kong from China. Kingfishers can be found searching for food in streams.

Most large wild animals are nocturnal and are rarely seen but porcupine, pangolin, masked palm civet, leopard cat, wild boar and python have been sighted in the area.

<text>Lubiniezky is a lava-flooded lunar impact crater on the northwest edge of Mare Nubium. It was named after Polish astronomer Stanisław Lubieniecki. This feature is most readily located by finding the prominent crater Bullialdus to the southeast.

The floor of Lubiniezky has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, which most likely entered from the surrounding mare through the gap in the southeast wall. The surviving rim forms a curved, worn rise around the relatively flat and featureless inner floor. The rim is joined by ridges attached to the north and west walls. To the north of this feature is the bowl-shaped crater Darney. The associated craters Lubiniezky A and E are also flooded, and lie to the northwest.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lubiniezky.

<doc id="983831" wikidata="Q641648" url="?curid=983831" title="Pallas (crater)">
<text>Pallas is a heavily eroded lunar impact crater located to the north of the Sinus Medii. It was named after the German-born Russian natural historian Peter Simon Pallas. To the northwest is the smaller but less worn crater Bode. Pallas shares a low wall with the crater Murchison that is attached to the southeast, and there are two gaps in the shared rim.

The outer wall of Pallas is worn, notched, and somewhat distorted in shape. The associated crater Pallas A lies across the northwest rim. The inner floor of Pallas has been flooded by lava, leaving a relatively flat surface. The crater possesses a central peak complex.

==Lunar flare==
On November 15, 1953, the physician and amateur astronomer Dr. Leon H. Stuart took a picture of the Moon that appeared to show a flare of light about 16 km southeast of Pallas. The flare was estimated to last for about 8–10 seconds. The report was published in a 1956 issue of &quot;The Strolling Astronomer&quot;, a newsletter. However the incident was dismissed by professionals of the period as more likely a meteoroid entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Many years later Dr. Bonnie Buratti of JPL saw the photograph and decided to investigate. Assisted by a graduate student, she identified a 1.5 km. diameter crater imaged by the Clementine spacecraft. The crater has the correct size, shape, and albedo to match the expected impact energy. Some astronomers now agree that Dr. Stuart may indeed have photographed an asteroid impact on the Moon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pallas.

<text>Pickering is a small lunar impact crater located to the northeast of the worn walled plain Hipparchus in the central region of the Moon. It was named after American astronomers Edward Charles Pickering and William Henry Pickering. It lies more than 25 km northeast of the crater Horrocks, which lies within Hipparchus. To the southeast is the lava-flooded Saunder.

Pickering is a bowl-shaped formation with a circular rim that has received little wear. It has a ray system that extends for about 160 kilometers.

<text>Khalid al-Masri (; other transcriptions: &quot;, , Khaled, El-Masri&quot;  ) is the name of a person alleged to have approached two 9/11 hijackers on a train in Germany and suggested that they contact an alleged al Qaeda operative in Duisburg.

The 9/11 Commission Report stated:

However, in response to Slahi&#x27;s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a U.S. District Court found only that Slahi &quot;provided lodging for three men for one night at his home in Germany [in November 1999], that one of them was Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and that there was discussion of jihad and Afghanistan&quot;.

An unrelated German citizen, Khalid El-Masri, spent almost five months in the covert CIA prison in Afghanistan called the Salt Pit in the early months of 2004, where he was interrogated and tortured. Alfreda Frances Bikowsky ordered El-Masri to be extraordinarily rendered, even though she only had a hunch El-Masri was the same person as al-Masri.

<doc id="983838" wikidata="Q4676866" url="?curid=983838" title="Acting governor">
<text>An acting governor is a person who acts in the role of governor. In Commonwealth jurisdictions where the governor is a vice-regal position, the role of &quot;acting governor&quot; may be filled by a lieutenant governor (as in most Australian states) or an administrator.

In some U.S. states, it is a constitutional position created when the governor dies in office or resigns. In other states, the governor may also be declared to be incapacitated and unable to function for various reasons including illness and absence from the state for more than a specified period.

In these instances, the state constitution will declare which official is to serve as governor and whether this person will have all of the powers of the office or only specified ones. In many states, the person succeeding to the governorship or becoming acting governor is the lieutenant governor; however, not all states have such a position. If the state constitution provides for an acting governor in the event of the governor&#x27;s disability, it will also provide for a method by which the governor can be declared to be no longer disabled.

==Examples of acting governors==
===Alabama===
George C. Wallace was shot in an assassination attempt in May 1972. With him out of state recovering for more than 120 days, Lt. Governor Jere Beasley acted as governor from June 5 to July 7, 1972, at which time Governor Wallace returned to the state and returned to office.

===Massachusetts===
In Massachusetts, in the event of a vacancy in the governor&#x27;s office, the lieutenant governor assumes the &quot;duties&quot; of the office, but &quot;not the office&quot; for the remainder of the term, thus becoming acting governor while retaining the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office. In 1997, when William Weld resigned to pursue the ambassadorship to Mexico, Paul Cellucci took over as acting governor until after his 1998 election as governor, when he assumed office in January 1999. In 2001, when Cellucci resigned to become United States Ambassador to Canada, Jane Swift became the acting governor until January 2003, when Cellucci&#x27;s term ended with the inauguration of Mitt Romney.

===New Jersey===
In New Jersey, a state which has a lieutenant governor, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. In case of the inability of the current governor to fulfill the gubernatorial duties through injury, the lieutenant governor serves as the acting governor. The acting governor performs powers and duties until the governor recovers from the injuries. If the governor&#x27;s death or resignation occurs less than 16 months before end of the term, the new governor serves until the end of the term, otherwise a special election (in which the new governor may participate) is held.

Prior to the establishment of the modern office of lieutenant governor following a constitutional referendum in 2005 that took effect in 2009, a vacancy in the office of governor would lead to the president of the state Senate to become acting governor while still retaining the title of senate president. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor&#x27;s post, serving until January 2002. Following DiFrancesco&#x27;s departure from the senate, John O. Bennett and Richard J. Codey each served as acting governor as well. As control of the New Jersey Senate was evenly split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett each held the office of acting governor for three days in January 2002, until Jim McGreevey began his term as governor. Codey again served as acting governor following McGreevey&#x27;s own resignation, serving from November 2004 until January 2006, when Jon Corzine took office as governor. These unusual events were a major factor in voters&#x27; decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of lieutenant governor in the 2005 referendum, effective with the 2009 election. Before the amendment could take effect, state transportation commissioner Kris Kolluri served as acting governor the day of December 28, 2006. As Governor Corzine, the senate president, assembly speaker, and attorney general were all out of state, Kolluri became acting governor.

===West Virginia===
In West Virginia, if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate president acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor&#x27;s term at the time of vacancy, a special election is held; otherwise, the Senate president serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate president the honorary title of lieutenant governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate president do not correspond with governorships. Then-Senate president Earl Ray Tomblin is the first person under the current state constitution to act as governor following the November 15, 2010 resignation of Joe Manchin following his election to the United States Senate seat vacated by the death of Robert Byrd. As there was more than one year remaining on Manchin&#x27;s term as governor, a special election was held, which Tomblin won. He became governor on November 13, 2011 to complete the term.

==Disputes over powers of acting governors==
The powers of an acting governor came into dispute during the 1980 Democratic primary presidential campaign of Jerry Brown, then governor of California. When he was campaigning out of state, which was often in late 1979 and early 1980, Mike Curb, a Republican who was then serving as lieutenant governor of California often used his position as acting governor to veto legislation, promulgate executive orders, issue proclamations, appoint Republican appellate court justices, and to do other things that Brown would not likely have done had he been present in the state. This eventually resulted in litigation, much of which went in Curb&#x27;s favor.

Powers of an acting governor had previously been questioned in the mid-1970s in Kentucky. In her capacity as acting governor of Kentucky in Julian Carroll&#x27;s absence, Thelma Stovall, then-lieutenant governor, acting as governor, issued pardons, called the Kentucky General Assembly into special session to enact legislation limiting property tax increases, and purported to veto the legislature&#x27;s repeal of its ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The authority of the lieutenant governor of Kentucky to act as governor when the elected governor is out of state was repealed under a 1992 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution.

In 1993, in Pennsylvania, Governor Robert P. Casey underwent surgery that left him incapacitated for months, thus leaving Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel as acting governor. During that time, Singel fulfilled all duties of the office of governor.

Following the death of New Hampshire Governor Hugh Gallen, Vesta M. Roy, as president of the state Senate, served as acting governor of New Hampshire from December 30, 1982, to January 6, 1983.

Practices in this area are anything but uniform from state to state. In Rhode Island, for example, the lieutenant governor never acts as governor, even if the governor has left the state. In most of the states, when the governor dies, resigns or is removed from office (via impeachment conviction), the next in line become the new governor, succeeding to the office &quot;and&quot; powers.

<text>Polybius is a lunar impact crater in the southeast part of the Moon, and is named after ancient Greek historian Polybius. It is located to the south-southeast of the larger crater Catharina, in the area framed by the Rupes Altai scarp. Some distance to the northeast is the Mare Nectaris, with the flooded craters Beaumont and Fracastorius.

The crater rim of Polybius appears slightly distended in the northeast, and has a cut through the northern wall. But the wall is otherwise moderately intact with only minor erosion. The interior floor is flat and almost featureless, with no central rise. To the south and east, a ray from Tycho cuts across the bowl-shaped Polybius A and Polybius B craterlets.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Polybius.

Polybius K is sometimes referred to as &quot;Larrieu’s Dam&quot; because the unusually straight northwest rim of the crater creates the appearance of a dam under certain lighting conditions.

<doc id="983846" wikidata="Q1338061" url="?curid=983846" title="Rhaeticus (crater)">
<text>Rhaeticus is a lunar impact crater that lies astride the equator of the Moon, on the southeast edge of the Sinus Medii. To the north-northwest is the crater Triesnecker, and due south can be found the worn remnant of the walled plain Hipparchus. The crater was named after Austrian astronomer Georg Joachim Rheticus.

==Description==
The outer wall of Rhaeticus is heavily disintegrated, with rifts and notches in the northeast. The wall is most intact along the eastern face, while in the northwest it is little more than a low rise in the surface. There is also a low cut in the south-southeast wall. The overall shape of the rim is that of a rough hexagon that is slightly elongated in the north–south direction. The interior has been resurfaced by lava, and only a few low rises remain in the surface. Beginning at the crest of the eastern wall is a chain of craterlets that continue to the east-northeast for about a crater diameter.

Running southwest from Rhaeticus to the crater Réaumur is a long rille, which is difficult to make out near Rhaeticus because of the group of mountains at that crater&#x27;s southwest. The crater itself is 43 kilometers wide at one diameter and 49 kilometers long at another. It is from the Pre-Imbrian period, which lasted from 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rhaeticus.

<doc id="983847" wikidata="Q7203926" url="?curid=983847" title="Pleasant Porter">
<text>Pleasant Porter (September 26, 1840 – September 3, 1907, Creek), was an American Indian statesman and the last elected Principal Chief of the Creek Nation, serving from 1899 until his death.

He had served with the Confederacy in the 1st Creek Mounted Volunteers, as superintendent of schools in the Creek Nation (1870), and as commander of the Creek Light Horsemen (1883). He was elected several times as the Creek delegate (non-voting status) to the United States Congress. In 1905 he was President of the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention, an effort by Native American tribes to acquire statehood for the Indian Territory. Congress did not approve their proposal, instead passing legislation to extinguish their land rights and make their territory part of the new state of Oklahoma in 1907.

==Early life==
Pleasant Porter was born on September 26, 1840, to Benjamin Edward Porter and Phoebe Perryman (Creek). She and her mother were of mixed-race, with some European ancestry in her grandfather&#x27;s line; she was the daughter of Lydia Perryman and &quot;Tah-lo-pee Tust-a-nuk-kee,&quot; a town chief. (Her mother Lydia was a daughter of Chief Perryman and his wife.) Porter was considered born into his mother&#x27;s Bird Clan, as the Creek had a matrilineal kinship system. Children took their social status from their mother&#x27;s family and clan.

He was born in the Creek Nation, Indian Territory, in what is now Wagoner County, Oklahoma. His Creek name was &quot;Talof Harjo&quot;, which means &quot;Crazy Bear&quot; in English.

His paternal grandfather, John Snodgrass Porter, had founded a family ranch here. He had fought with Andrew Jackson against the Creek in Georgia after the massacre at Fort Mims. To minimize further bloodshed, Captain Porter volunteered to mediate between the Creek leaders and white army. Grateful for his efforts, the Creek adopted him as an honorary member of the tribe.

They allowed him to settle on Creek land in Russell County, Alabama. When the federal government began urging Indian Removal to west of the Mississippi River, John Porter moved with the first group of Lower Creek, who went to Indian Territory in the 1820s. There, he settled on the north bank of the Arkansas River. He developed a plantation based on the labor of enslaved African Americans.

As John Porter was dying in 1847, family members gathered around his deathbed. His grandson Pleasant was seven. According to historian John Meserve, Porter put his hand on the boy&#x27;s head and announced to the family, &quot;He will do more than any of you.&quot;

Pleasant Porter was educated at the Tullahassee Mission School on the Creek Nation, where he studied for five years. He grew up in a bi-cultural environment, and he was fluent in both Muscogee and English. This gave him an advantage in operating in both the white and Creek worlds as an adult. He supplemented this basic education by developing a lifelong habit of study at home. After leaving school, he clerked in a store for some time. He traveled to New Mexico, where he drove cattle until the outbreak of the Civil War.

==Civil War service==
During the Civil War, Porter served in the First Confederate Creek Regiment. Most of the Creek had allied with the Confederacy, whose leaders promised to establish an all-Indian state if they were victorious. He had enlisted as a Private under the command of Col. D. N. McIntosh. (He was the son of chief William McIntosh, who had been a prominent leader in the treaty party. They had agreed to cede communal lands in the homeland and remove to Indian Territory without gaining consensus. McIntosh was later executed by opponents for this action.)

Porter participated in several battles, including Round Mountain, Chusto-Talasah (Bird Creek), Chustenahlah, Pea Ridge and Honey Springs. He was wounded three times, once in the thigh. He walked with a limp for the rest of his life. Twice he was wounded in the head. His highest rank was Quartermaster Sergeant.

==Creek political life==
In 1865, after the end of the war, Porter served as a guard for Creek commissioners who traveled to Fort Smith, Arkansas, to begin peace negotiations with U. S. government representatives. The US required a new peace treaty following the war, one that included emancipation of Creek-owned enslaved African Americans. The Creek government reorganized in 1866.

Porter was asked by Creek Nation leaders to reorganize the schools, which had been disrupted by the war. Most of the missionaries who had established schools had left the Territory during the war. In 1871, Porter was reelected as superintendent of schools, but declined a second term.

===Tribal insurrections===
The &quot;Sands Rebellion&quot; of 1871 was the culmination of grievances between two Creek factions. These had roots to divisions in the society from the Southeast, between the Lower Creek, who tended to have lived more closely near European Americans and had more interaction with them. They had more members and leaders of mixed-blood or partial European ancestry, and more of their men had received some European-American education. The Upper Creek, by contrast, had been more isolated from European-American culture, were still primarily full-blood Creek in ancestry, and kept to traditional ways. Even decades after removal to Indian Territory, divisions remained among the Creek. In 1871 the name &quot;Sands&quot; refers to the leader of a disgruntled group of Upper Creek led by &quot;Oktars-sars-har-jo&quot; (known in English as &quot;Sands&quot;.)

When Principal Chief Samuel Checote convened a National Creek Council in October 1871, nearly 300 Sands followers marched on the capital and dispersed the meeting. Pleasant Porter, commanding a group of Creek horsemen, together with a group of Federal agents, put down the short-lived rebellion without loss of life. Porter convinced the Sands followers to lay down their arms and go home.

In the fall of 1872, the Creek Nation selected Porter as a delegate to Washington, D.C., to represent the nation&#x27;s interests with Congress and the government. He performed this work so effectively that he served for much of his life on business in the national capital. He soon became well-known and respected by members of Congress and several presidents, and was befriended by President Theodore Roosevelt.

In 1875, Lachar Harjo was elected Principal Chief to replace Checote. Checote supporters controlled the Creek legislature and impeached Harjo, replacing him with a Checote supporter. Porter was called on to quell the subsequent demonstration and convinced the Haijo supporters to go home.

In 1882, Judge Isparhecher, from Okmulgee, was charged with sedition by the Creek National Council and removed from office. He gathered about 350 followers of Sands and Haijo, established a military camp and formed a rival government, complete with armed light horsemen.

Checote recalled Porter from Washington and put him in charge of about 700 men. He attacked the opponents camp, beginning what historian Meserve says the Creek called the &quot;Green Peach War&quot;. Porter&#x27;s troops chased their opponents into Sac and Fox territory in February 1883. Isparhecher and his remaining followers tried to gain asylum with the Kiowa, but U. S. troops captured them and sent them to Fort Gibson. According to Meserve, there were seven or eight casualties in the Green Peach War. Afterward, some Creek began calling Porter &quot;General&quot; as an honorific title.

Isparhecher remained the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the full-bloods (then known as the Nuyaka faction). When Checote stepped down as principal chief in 1883, an election elevated a follower of Isparhecher to the position, narrowly defeating Isparhecher himself. Checote came in a distant third. Isparhecher served briefly in December 1883. On February 24, 1884, the Indian Agent at Muskogee, under orders from the Secretary of the Interior, whose department administered Native American affairs, officially recognized Joseph Perryman as the principal chief, although he was not elected by the council.

Under the terms of the Dawes Act, the Creek Nation had to agree to an allotment of former tribal lands to individual households, in an effort to force adaptation to European-American styles of farming and property ownership. Porter headed another Creek commission to negotiate the terms with Federal officials. Agreement was announced September 27, 1897, and incorporated as part of the Curtis Act, passed by Congress in June 1898. The US insisted that any land remaining after allotment would be considered &quot;surplus&quot; and made available for sale to non-Indians. Although the agreement was rejected by the Creek in an election on November 1, 1898, the Dawes Commission began to register tribal members for the process of allotment.

Porter headed a delegation to Washington, C. C. in January 1889 to negotiate the terms for turning over some more of their land to the United States, as required by the 1866 peace treaty. At the time the treaty was signed, it was intended that these lands were to be used for the resettlement of other Native Americans and freedmen. The lands were not intended for settlement by whites. Now, the government wanted to open these so-called &quot;unassigned lands&quot; for white settlement. Porter and his delegation agreed to remove the restrictions on land use in exchange for $2.25 million. The agreement was signed on January 31, 1889.

Pleasant Porter was elected Principal Chief on September 5, 1899. He and his delegation negotiated more concessions regarding rights of individual Creek members than had been allowed to many other tribes. But, many Creek opposed the allotment plan and break-up of communal land. In 1900, a leader of the full-blood faction, Chitto Harjo (&quot;Crazy Snake&quot;), declared a separate government. Porter appealed to the U. S. government for help putting down the revolt. A cavalry troop arrived and arrested the leaders in January 1901. Crazy Snake and his lieutenants pleaded guilty, were lectured by the judge, and sent home.

Porter was reelected as Principal Chief in 1903. The powers of the office had been greatly reduced by the Curtis Act, so its duties were largely ceremonial or clerical. Much time was consumed signing land allotment deeds. Porter and other prominent leaders became interested in the movement to create a state out of Indian Territory, to be governed by Native Americans. The movement proposed to call it the State of Sequoyah, after the Cherokee who created an alphabet.

==Porter and the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention==

The Sequoyah Convention met in the Hinton Theater at Muskogee on August 21, 1905. The purposes were to draft a constitution for the proposed state, choose a name for the state, and name a capital city. Porter was elected permanent chairman of the convention. Other key officers elected by the delegates included Charles N. Haskell, vice chair and Alexander Posey, secretary. The delegates met again on the following day, then departed. They reconvened for a three-day meeting in September, at which the proposed constitution was overwhelmingly approved. At a third session on October 14, the delegates voted to authorize Porter and Posey to sign the document on behalf of all the delegates.

==Family life==
After the Civil War, Porter restored the family plantation. He also went into business as a merchant and rancher. He opened a general store at Okmulgee that he sold in 1869. He moved to Wealaka, built a home and lived there for the rest of his life.

Pleasant Porter married Mary Ellen Keys in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 25, 1872. She was born in the Cherokee Nation on April 6, 1854, the daughter of Judge Riley Keys and his wife; he was chief justice of the courts of the Cherokee Nation for twenty-five years. The Porters had three children: William Adair, Pleasant and Annetta Mary. Mary Ellen died at Wealaka on January 15, 1886.

The widower Porter married Mattie Leonora Bertholf, a cousin of his first wife, on May 26, 1886. They had one daughter, Leonora. She died July 19, 1929.

==Death==
Porter, accompanied by Judge John R. Thomas and M. L. Mott, Creek Nation attorney, boarded a train on September 2, 1907, to attend to legal business in Missouri. They had to stop over in Vinita, I. T. to change trains. Porter complained of feeling unwell, had a stroke sometime that night, lapsed into a coma and died on the morning of September 3, 1907. He is buried in the Pleasant Porter Cemetery in Bixby, Oklahoma.

<text>Top Secret! is a 1984 action comedy film written and directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker (ZAZ) and Martyn Burke. It stars Val Kilmer (in his film debut role) and Lucy Gutteridge alongside a supporting cast featuring Omar Sharif, Peter Cushing, Michael Gough, and Jeremy Kemp. The film parodies various film styles such as musicals starring Elvis Presley, spy films of the Cold War era and World War II films. The original music score was composed by Maurice Jarre.

==Plot==
Nick Rivers, an American rock star (&quot;Skeet Surfin), travels to East Germany to perform at a cultural festival, which secretly serves the East German government as a diversion for a military operation with the intent of reuniting Germany under their rule. At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement who is attempting to avoid the authorities. He pretends to be her date to get to know her, and performs an impromptu song and dance (&quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;), mistakenly thinking he was asked to do so, to the delight of Hillary and the diners, but to the annoyance of General Streck, the mastermind of the &quot;reunification&quot; plot.

Nick later sees Hillary at a ballet, where she expects to rendezvous with the resistance leader, but is met by the police instead. Nick saves her and they try to escape, but Nick turns himself in so that Hillary can get away. He is taken to a prison where he is questioned and tortured, but he knows nothing and does not break. In an escape attempt, he ends up in the secret prison laboratory of Dr. Paul Flammond, a brilliant scientist developing the &quot;Polaris naval mine&quot;, a device that can destroy the entire NATO submarine fleet as part of the government&#x27;s plot. The East Germans force him to work by threatening to kill his daughter, Hillary. Nick is recaptured and scheduled for execution.

The East Germans decide that Nick must perform to avoid an international incident, and he does so to the rapturous joy of the local girls (&quot;How Silly Can You Get&quot;/&quot;Spend This Night with Me&quot;). He is rescued by Hillary at the end of his performance, after which they spend the night in the loft of a Swedish bookstore. Then Nick plays for her (&quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight?&quot;) and they make love. The next morning, they are moved to the &quot;Potato Farm&quot; where they meet members of the French Resistance, led by Nigel &quot;The Torch&quot;, who was Hillary&#x27;s lover from when they were stranded on an island as youths. Nick is upset by Hillary&#x27;s love for Nigel, but accepts that they must work together for the cause. After fighting off an attack by the East Germans (who were tipped off by a mystery traitor) they move to a pizza restaurant, where Nick proves his identity by performing for the locals (&quot;Straighten Out the Rug&quot;).

The resistance group stages a rescue of Dr. Flammond, where Nigel and Du Quois, a resistance leader, dress up in a fake cow outfit to disable the prison&#x27;s defenses. While the other members successfully infiltrate the prison, Nigel reveals himself as the traitor, but his plans are ruined by an amorous bull. Dr. Flammond is rescued, but Nigel makes off with Hillary and Nick is forced to rescue her in an underwater bar fight. With their flight about to leave, Hillary chooses to go with Nick and her father to America.

==Production==
After the success of &quot;Airplane!&quot; the team of ZAZ were unsure of what to do next. They made the TV series &quot;Police Squad!&quot; but it was cancelled after six episodes. David Zucker explained:

We just needed a subject that we would be excited about. Starting out, we didn&#x27;t have a whole genre like the airplane disaster movies. We were just fans of those black and white World War II movies that were made during the war. Somehow, we didn&#x27;t think that was enough: we didn&#x27;t want to do a period piece, we wanted to make it contemporary. That was the whole concept of &#x27;Top Secret!&#x27;: that it was not necessarily grounded in reality, but it would have kind of this heightened sense of craziness – even to which genres we were picking, which was a split hybrid between Elvis movies and the World War II movies.

David Zucker said they had been working on the script since &quot;Airplane!&quot; &quot;but we just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do it. We made repeated attempts to combine a rock and roll movie with a World War II movie but it was very difficult to do ... We already had ideas for scenes we wanted to do and we tried to fit in plot around those scenes&quot;. A fourth writer, Martyn Burke, was brought in to work on the plot. &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for Martyn we&#x27;d still be sitting in that room&quot;, said Jerry Zucker. The film was mostly written at the offices of ZAZ&#x27;s lawyers. The film&#x27;s budget was a reported $8.5 million, whereas &quot;Airplane!&quot; was made for $3.2 million. Key portions of &quot;Top Secret!&quot; are parodies of &quot;The Conspirators&quot;, including the street scene with the novelty vendor.

===Casting===
Kilmer was cast after the directors saw him in a play called &quot;Slab Boys&quot; with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He turned up to the audition dressed like Elvis Presley. &quot;I like to think of it as the role Elvis never got but should have&quot;, said Abrahams. Lucy Gutteridge, who plays the female lead, had just appeared in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;. Unlike &quot;Airplane!&quot;, the film does not feature a large number of cameos by famous actors, because, as Zucker explained, &quot;That was one of the jokes in &quot;Airplane!&quot; and we had done it and wanted to move on.&quot; Two well-known actors who were cast in the film were Omar Sharif as Agent Cedric and Peter Cushing as a Swedish bookstore proprietor.

==Soundtrack==
==Release==
The film was test screened at various colleges and as a result of audience responses, the length was cut from around two hours to 90 minutes. The film was scheduled for release on June 8, 1984 but Paramount pushed the date back to June 22, angering some exhibitors. The official reason was that Paramount wanted to avoid competing against &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot; although rumours spread that the studio was dissatisfied with the film&#x27;s quality. Producer Jon Davison denied this saying &quot;Paramount has a lot of confidence in the picture or they wouldn&#x27;t have cared. The mere fact that they&#x27;ve bothered to trouble some of their relationships with exhibitors shows their faith in the picture.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was considered a box-office bomb, though it still earned $20 million. A 1991 article speculated two possible reasons – the performance of &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (although it had different producers from the original), along with &quot;the lack of any clear sense of period, something that may throw viewers who insist on comedic nonessentials like interior logic. It&#x27;s basically a parody of World War II-French Resistance movies, but along the way it also skewers &#x27;50s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll films ... &#x27;60s &quot;Beach Party&quot; movies and &#x27;The Blue Lagoon,&#x27; among other lampoon-worthy source material.&quot; &quot;The lesson we took from &quot;Airplane!&quot; was just fill up 90 minutes with jokes, and you have a movie&quot;, reflected David Zucker later. &quot;With &quot;Top Secret&quot;, it&#x27;s very funny, but it really isn&#x27;t a good movie. It really didn&#x27;t have a plot or real characters or real structure.&quot;

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Top Secret!&quot; finds the team of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker sending up everything from spy movies to Elvis musicals with reckless, loony abandon.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert rated it out of 4 stars and applauded the humor, noting that &quot;to describe the plot would be an exercise in futility&quot; and &quot;This movie will cheerfully go for a laugh wherever one is even remotely likely to be found.&quot; &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic considers this his all-time favorite movie. Jay Bauman of Red Letter Media described it as the best ZAZ film and &quot;maybe one of the best comedies of all time.&quot;

<text>Saunder is a lunar impact crater located in the central highland region of the Moon, to the east-northeast of the walled plain Hipparchus. Its diameter is 44 km. It was named after British mathematician Samuel Arthur Saunder. The outer wall is irregular and broken in several locations, forming the overall shape of a pentagon. The interior of Saunder has been flooded with lava, forming a level surface just below the rim. The floor lacks a central peak, but there are low rises in the southeast quadrant and a tiny craterlet towards the north rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Saunder.

<doc id="983860" wikidata="Q1721483" url="?curid=983860" title="Kaipara Harbour">
<text>Kaipara Harbour is a large enclosed harbour estuary complex on the north western side of the North Island of New Zealand. The northern part of the harbour is administered by the Kaipara District and the southern part is administered by the Auckland Council. The local Māori tribe is Ngāti Whātua.

By area, the Kaipara Harbour is one of the largest harbours in the world. It covers at high tide, with exposed as mudflats and sandflats at low tide.

According to Māori tradition, the name Kaipara had its origins back in the 15th century when the Arawa chief, Kahumatamomoe, travelled to the Kaipara to visit his nephew at Pouto. At a feast, he was so impressed with the cooked root of the para fern, that he gave the name Kai-para to the district. &quot;Kaipara&quot; comes from the Māori meaning &quot;food&quot;, and meaning &quot;king fern&quot;.

== Geography ==
The harbour extends for some from north to south. Several large arms extend into the interior of the peninsula at the northeast of the harbour, one of them ending near the town of Maungaturoto, only ten kilometres (6 mi) from the Pacific Ocean coast. The harbour has extensive catchments feeding five rivers and over a hundred streams, and includes large estuaries formed by the Wairoa, Otamatea, Oruawharo, Tauhoa (Channel) and Kaipara. A number of small islands off the shoreline are connected to the mainland by mudflats at low tide.

The Kaipara Harbour is broad and mostly shallow, as it is formed from a system of drowned river valleys. The harbour shoreline is convoluted by the entry of many rivers and streams, and is about long, being the drainage catchment for about 640,000 ha of land.

The harbour entrance is a channel to the Tasman Sea. It narrows to a width of , and is over deep in parts. On average, Kaipara tides rise and fall . Spring tidal flows reach 9 km/h (5 knots) in the entrance channel and move 1,990 million cubic metres per tidal movement or 7,960 million cubic metres daily.

The harbour head is a hostile place. Big waves from the Tasman Sea break over large sandbanks about five metres below the surface, two to five kilometres from the shore. The sand in these sandbanks comes mainly from the Waikato River. Sand discharged from this river is transported northward by the prevailing coastal currents. Some of this sand is carried into the Kaipara harbour entrance, but mostly cycles out again and then continues moving northwards along the west coast. The southern sandbanks at the entrance are constantly accumulating and releasing this sand.

These treacherous sandbanks shift and change position, and are known locally as &quot;the graveyard&quot;. The graveyard is responsible for more shipwrecks than any other place in New Zealand, and has claimed at least 43 vessels—some say as many as 110. For this reason, a lighthouse was built in 1884 on the northern arm of the entrance (Pouto Peninsula). It was automated in 1947 and closed in the mid 1950s. The structure still exists and was renovated in 1982–84.

In Māori mythology, the ocean-going canoe &quot;Māhuhu&quot; voyaged from Hawaiki to New Zealand and overturned on the northern side of the entrance. It was commanded by the chief Rongomai, who drowned. His body was eaten by araara (white trevally), and his descendants to this day will not eat that type of fish. The first European shipwreck was the &quot;Aurora&quot;, a 550-ton barque, in 1840, and the most recent was the yacht &quot;Aosky&quot; in 1994. Today, the remains of wrecks still become visible under certain tidal and sand conditions. The Kaipara is rarely used today for shipping, and no large settlements lie close to its shores, although many small communities lie along its coastline.

== Geology ==

The Kaipara Harbour is a drowned river valley system, which first formed 2-3 million years ago as an open bay, becoming a sheltered harbour as elongated sand dune barriers formed at the harbour&#x27;s mouth. Over the last two million years, the harbour has cycled between periods of being a forested river valley and a flooded harbour, depending on changes in the global sea level. The present harbour formed approximately 8,000 years ago, after the Last Glacial Maximum.

== Ecology ==


The Kaipara Harbour is a productive marine ecosystem, with diverse habitats and ecotones. There are tidal reaches, intertidal mudflats and sandflats, freshwater swamps, maritime rushes, reed beds and coastal scrublands. The area includes 125 square kilometres of mangrove forest. with subtidal fringes of seagrass.

The Kaipara is a migratory bird habitat of international significance. Forty–two coastal species are known, and up to 50,000 birds are common. Rare species use the harbour for feeding during summer before returning to the Northern Hemisphere to breed, such as the bar-tailed godwit, lesser knot, and turnstone. Threatened or endangered native species, such as the North Island fernbird, fairy tern, crake, Australasian bittern, banded rail, grey‑faced petrels, banded and NZ dotterels, South Island pied oystercatcher, pied stilt, and wrybill are also present . Significant local populations of black swan, pūkeko, and grey duck also breed in the area.

Land habitats adjacent to the harbour support some rare botanical species, including native orchids, the king fern, and the endangered kaka beak.

In particular, Papakanui Spit on the south head of the harbour entrance, a mobile sandspit, is important as a breeding and roosting area for the New Zealand dotterel and the fairy tern. It also has areas of pingao. The spit was an important habitat for the Caspian tern. The birds have moved to other parts of Kaipara Harbour, possibly due to human disturbance. An air weapons range used by the New Zealand Defence Force is a short distance south of the spit.

Māori settlements and marae have been scattered around the harbour margins for hundreds of years. The waterways of the Kaipara provided, and still provide, Māori with resources and a ready means of moving between marae.

Today most marae are associated with the Ngāti Whātua sub-tribes, Te Taoū and Te Uri-o-Hau. These sub-tribes both descend from the chief Haumoewhārangi who settled on the north end of the Kaipara entrance at Poutō. He was killed in an argument about kūmara (sweet potatoes). His widow Waihekeao developed a partnership with a Tainui warrior chief, Kāwharu. Kāwharu led several destructive campaigns around Kaipara. Eventually the descendants of Waihekeao and Haumoewhārangi came to control the Kaipara Harbour. Te Uri-o-Hau was founded by Hakiputatōmuri, and controlled the northern part of Kaipara Harbour. Te Taoū was founded by Mawake, and controlled the south.

=== European history ===

In 1770, on his first voyage, James Cook sighted and recorded the harbour. He named it &quot;False Bay&quot;, noting in his journal that it had &quot;the appearance of a Bay or inlet, but I believe it is only low land&quot;.

In 1839, European settlers began arriving in the Kaipara to fell and mill kauri trees and build boats for local requirements. Despite the perilous bar at the harbour entrance, the Kaipara became a busy timber port from the 1860s, shipping thousands of tonnes of kauri timber and gum. The first sailing ship wrecked at the entrance to the harbour was the &quot;Aurora&quot; in April 1840. The brigantine &quot;Sophia Pate&quot; was wrecked at South Head in August 1841 with the loss of all 21 on board.

The Wairoa is the main river feeding the Kaipara from the north. Thirty kilometres upstream, the town of Dargaville was established. The stretch of water to Dargaville is broad and straight and provides an easy to navigate route into what were then kauri forests in the interior. Dargaville flourished and immigrants from Britain and Croatia were attracted to the area. Ships up to 3,000 tons carried timber and logs out along the Wairoa to defy the bar at the harbour entrance before continuing on, usually to another New Zealand port or across the Tasman to Australia.

The Kaipara River is the principal river feeding Kaipara Harbour from the south. From 1863 Helensville established itself as a timber port on this river, and provided shipping services about the Kaipara. When the timber ran out, Helensville developed sheep and dairy farms, and more recently nut plantations, vineyards and deer farms.

Further south, Riverhead was an important trading link with the Kaipara and Helensville, and a centre for gum digging. Also set by a river, it milled timber and flour, and made paper. Later it turned to tobacco. From 1929 to 1933, the Riverhead State Forest was developed from 5,000 ha of exhausted gum land.

As the kauri ran out, the Kaipara became a backwater. After 1920 the gum and timber industries dwindled, and farming, mainly dairying, took over. In particular, there is dairying on the rich Ruāwai flats. These flats are below sea level, and are protected by a stopbank and a drainage system. Coastal sawmill settlements at Tinopai, Arapaoa, Batley, Matakohe, Oneriri, Ōruawharo, Pahi, Paparoa, Tanoa and Whakapirau have become quiet backwaters. Pahi has become a launch point for houseboats and fishing. Matakohe has a museum which commemorates the kauri industry and the early Pākehā settlers.

Today, Dargaville is the principal centre in the Kaipara area. Its population levelled in the 1960s. It is the country&#x27;s main kūmara (sweet potato) producer.

===Fisheries===
Much of the coastal fishing industry in New Zealand depends on mangrove forests. About 80% of fish caught commercially are linked to food chains dependent on the mangroves, and at least 30 species of fish use mangrove wetlands at some stage of their life cycle.

The marine and estuarine areas in the Kaipara Harbour breed snapper, mullet, flounder, sole, kahawai, white trevally, gurnard, yellow‑eyed mullet and skates, rays and sharks. The Kaipara is the largest estuarine harbour on the west coast of New Zealand and provides significant areas of suitable breeding grounds and habitats for juvenile fish. It has fewer problems with water quality than the Manukau, and is the single most significant wetland for west coast fisheries.

In 2009, NIWA scientists discovered that 98 percent of snapper on the west coast of the North Island were originally juveniles from nurseries in the Kaipara. Snapper is New Zealand&#x27;s largest recreational fishery, and is also a commercial fishery with an annual export value of $32 million. The findings show how fragile some fish stocks can be, and highlights the importance of protecting natural habitats, like the Kaipara.

Native rock oysters are plentiful on the rocky shores, and the introduced Pacific oysters flourish lower in the intertidal zone. There are cockles and tuatua on the lower tidal flats, mussels from low tide on the rocks to subtidal beds closer to the mouth of the harbour, and scallops in the tidal channels.

The scallop population has periodic incidences of high mortality, the causes of which have not been identified. Concerns in recent years about the size and availability of scallops have resulted in temporary closures of the scallop fisheries.

Early versions of oyster farming occurred between the early 1900s and 1950s. Thousands of tons of rocks were placed along the shorelines to act as an additional substrate on which the natural rock oyster could grow. In 2002, the Crown settled the historical claims of Te Uri o Hau, a hapū of the northern Kaipara Harbour. As part of the settlement, access to and the rights of the hapū to gather oysters within the existing &quot;Maori Oyster Areas&quot; were recognised. In 2008, resource consent was given to Biomarine to establish New Zealand&#x27;s largest oyster farm in the Kaipara. The farm is projected to produce about NZ$30 million in annual exports and 100 new jobs.

In recent years, there has been a perception amongst locals that commercial fishers have damaged fisheries in the Kaipara. Locals have been frustrated in their attempts to gain government support. The veteran filmmaker Barry Barclay has examined this in his 2005 documentary, &quot;The Kaipara affair&quot;.

===Sand mining===

Currently (2007) about 219,000 cubic metres of sand is mined each year from the entrance and tidal deltas of the Kaipara. This sand contributes over half the sand requirements for Auckland. The sand is used in the production of concrete and asphalt, and also in drainage systems and beach nourishment. A suction pump is usually used to extract the sand from the seabed. It is pumped into a barge as a sand and water slurry. As the barge loads, shells and other objects are screened out and the sea water drained back to the sea. The availability of sea sand within the Auckland region means the road costs of transporting sand from further parts of the country are avoided. Concerns about possible negative consequences of this sand mining have also been raised.

===Tidal power===

In 2008, Crest Energy, a power company, received resource consent to install about 200 underwater tidal turbines in the Kaipara Harbour, which would use the substantial tidal flows moving in and out every day near the harbour mouth to produce electricity for approximately 250,000 homes.

Crest planned to place the turbines at least 30 metres deep along a ten kilometre stretch of the main channel. Historical charts show this stretch of the channel has changed little over 150 years. The output of the turbines will cycle twice daily with the predictable rise and fall of the tide. Each turbine will have a maximum output of 1.2 MW, and is expected to generate 0.75 MW averaged over time.

The peak level of generation for the combined turbines is about 200 MW. This exceeds the projected peak electricity needs of Northland. It would have environmental benefits in offsetting annual carbon emissions from a thermal-based, gas turbine generator of 575,000 tonnes of carbon. The project was costed at about $600 million and to be economic would have to be scaled up rapidly to near full capacity.

However, while the Department of Conservation had approved the project, and had made substantial environmental monitoring conditions part of the consent, the project also had objectors on the grounds of claimed influences on the local ecosystems and charter fishing (see the section above on fisheries). Appeals before the Environment Court are still likely. The project was put on hold by Crest Energy in late 2013; its director Anthony cited several issues that prevented the project from proceeding. He also sold the majority of his shareholdings to Todd Energy Ltd the same year.

==Management issues==
Management of the Kaipara Harbour does not have a central administration. Management is distributed among the Kaipara District Council, Auckland Council, Northland Regional Council, the Department of Conservation&#x27;s Northland and Auckland section, and the Ministry of Fisheries.

The Ministry of Fishing allocates quota for the north west region of New Zealand as a whole, but does not tailor quota specifically for the Kaipara. Local iwi feel they are not sufficiently involved in management issues, and to further compound matters, the local iwi is split between Te Uri-o-Hau in the northern part and Te Taoū in the southern part.

== Environmental issues ==
As of 2011, the environmental state of the harbour has been called as &quot;nearing crisis&quot; and &quot;in significant decline&quot;, with shrinking fish and shellfish stocks, more sedimentation, declining water quality and competition for resource use and development being noted as the main issues, with &quot;ninety-nine per cent of the rivers in the catchment [are] polluted&quot;.

As part of the worldwide trend, there is a decline in biodiversity within the Kaipara. The timber industry removed most of the native forest. Much of the kauri and kahikatea forest, and scrub and riparian vegetation, has been replaced with farm and urban areas. Mangrove forests and wetlands have been &quot;reclaimed&quot;. Soil erosion has increased on the land and sedimentation in the harbour. Shellfish abundance has declined, especially toheroa, scallops, tuatua, cockles and pipi. Finfish like mullet, snapper, kanae and school shark have diminished.

Habitat fragmentation has also occurred. Natural vegetation in the Kaipara catchments have been reduced to islands of wetlands and forest in human-made landscapes—separated by urban areas, roads, exotic forests and pastures. More information is needed on biodiversity in the Kaipara Harbour and habitats in associated coastal areas. A recent pilot survey found that habitats in the estuaries are still extensive, but ninety percent of land cover is no longer indigenous wetland or vegetation. Even if the key existing areas were to be protected, further buffers and corridors that give better connection between the natural areas would be needed to encourage the recovery of biodiversity.

<text>Schiaparelli ( , , ) is a lunar impact crater located on the western part of the Oceanus Procellarum, to the west of the crater Herodotus. The rim is relatively sharp-edged and relatively free from impact wear. The inner walls have slumped to form a shelf around much of the sides. The interior floor is somewhat irregular, but free from impacts of note.

This crater lies in a relatively flat and featureless part of the mare, although a ray streak from the distant crater Glushko passes along the southeastern edge of the rim, making it easy to identify. A low wrinkle ridge runs from the north rim of the crater to the north. Within the crater is a low central rise.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schiaparelli.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Schiaparelli B — &quot;See&quot; Zinner (crater).
* Schiaparelli D — &quot;See&quot; Golgi (crater).

<text>Orlando Ruben Jordan (born April 21, 1974) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure in WWE on its SmackDown brand, where he was a one-time United States Champion and for his time with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1999–2002) ===
Jordan made his professional wrestling debut in 1999. In 2000, he worked for Maryland Championship Wrestling where at time he teamed with his brother Marcus. On February 9, 2002 he defeated the Bruiser to win his first title the MCW Heavyweight Championship for a week. He dropped the title back to the Bruiser.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2006) ===
==== Early years (2001–2004) ====
Jordan wrestled his first match in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on December 21, 2001 in a dark match where he defeated Billy Fives on &quot;WWF Jakked&quot;. He continued to wrestle for the WWF (which changed its name to WWE in May 2002) in house shows and dark matches. In 2002, he worked for WWE&#x27;s developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. Jordan made his WWE television debut on the May 31, 2003, episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, where he defeated Jamie Noble. On June 26, 2003, Jordan made his first &quot;SmackDown!&quot; appearance as a face at Madison Square Garden, where he lost to John Cena. Although he did not win the match, he was impressive enough that when Cena attacked Jordan after the match was over, The Undertaker, with whom Cena was feuding, came to the ring and helped Jordan to his feet. On the October 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan defeated Big Show via countout when Big Show had to run to the restroom after eating a burrito laced with laxatives. Jordan answered an open challenge hosted by Brock Lesnar on the January 29, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where he was quickly defeated.

==== The Cabinet and United States Champion (2004–2005) ====
After an absence of multiple months due to family issues, Jordan returned on the August 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, defeating René Duprée. Later in the night, Jordan turned heel by saving WWE Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) from an attack by The Undertaker. On the August 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan joined JBL&#x27;s Cabinet, where he was appointed &quot;Chief of Staff&quot;. Jordan faced The Undertaker in the main event later that night, losing by disqualification after JBL attacked The Undertaker mid-match. On the August 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan once again faced The Undertaker, this time with JBL&#x27;s WWE Championship on the line. The match once again ended in a disqualification after JBL again interfered. On the November 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan and JBL defeated Eddie Guerrero and Booker T, after interference from The Basham Brothers, who were made the Cabinet&#x27;s &quot;co-secretaries of defense&quot; on the December 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Jordan, JBL and the Bashams were defeated by Booker T, The Undertaker and Eddie Guerrero in a 4-on-3 handicap match on the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Jordan entered his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 30, 2005, but was eliminated by Booker T.

After JBL began a feud with John Cena over the WWE Championship leading up to WrestleMania 21, Jordan faced off with Cena on the March 3 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Jordan defeated Cena with the help of JBL to win the United States Championship, his first and only title in WWE. In a dark match before WrestleMania 21, Jordan competed in a 30-man battle royal, won by Booker T. His first major 
successful title defense was against Heidenreich at Judgment Day. At The Great American Bash, Jordan began feuding with the newly drafted Chris Benoit. Jordan defeated Benoit and retained his United States Championship after removing the turnbuckle pad and shoving Benoit head-first into the exposed steel and covered him for the win. Benoit continued to chase Jordan for the title. He finally defeated Jordan (in a record 25.5 seconds) at SummerSlam to win the title. Following this quick match, Jordan attempted to win the United States Championship back on multiple occasions, leading to 3 consecutive losses with all matches lasting less than a minute. The first rematch lasted 23.4 seconds. During the second rematch, Jordan actually almost knocked out Benoit with a punch in the opening moments but still lost at 22.5 seconds, which was even faster than the first match. During the third match, Jordan stalled until the time, which was being displayed on the TitanTron, went over 25 seconds. He got so excited when his time went over 30 seconds that he dropped his guard and Benoit took the opportunity to lock on the Crippler Crossface for a win at the 49.8 second mark. On the October 14 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan stated that he mastered every counter to Benoit&#x27;s signature &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot;. Jordan also stated, if he tapped out to the &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot;, Jordan would quit this business. Jordan lived up to his words by countering every &quot;Crippler Crossface&quot; attempt by Benoit. The match ultimately ended after Jordan tapped out to Benoit&#x27;s &quot;Sharpshooter&quot;. After those unsuccessful rematches, Jordan later broke away from JBL, although both made a few appearances together later on.

==== Various feuds and departure (2005–2006) ====

When Booker T got injured halfway through his Best of Seven series for the United States Championship, he needed a replacement to face Chris Benoit. As the series was at 3–1 in Booker T&#x27;s favor, Booker T only needed his replacement to win one match in order to become the United States Champion. Jordan approached him about the position, but Booker T and his wife Sharmell belittled him and made jokes about his quick submission losses to Benoit. Booker T asked Randy Orton to substitute for him. After Orton failed to win the deciding match, leading Jordan to once again ask for the position the next week, Booker T once again turned Jordan down after belittling him. During the sixth match in the series, Jordan jumped the rail, grabbed Booker T&#x27;s crutch, and hit Benoit for a disqualification finish and thus giving Benoit the victory and tying the Best of Seven Series at 3–3. The next week, Jordan ran to ringside to attempt to halt Booker T from winning the championship, but was unable to prevent Orton from eventually beating Benoit to win the series for Booker T. On the January 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jordan faced and lost to Randy Orton after Booker T&#x27;s wife Sharmell distracted the SmackDown! senior official referee Nick Patrick, before Booker T hit him with a leg crutch. After the match, Chris Benoit saved him from Booker T and Orton, turning him face for the first time since 2004.

Jordan was then pushed down to &quot;Velocity&quot; and won several matches there. Jordan made his final &quot;SmackDown!&quot; appearance on the May 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a backstage segment, telling Nunzio that he had seen someone who looked like his partner Vito dressed in drag at a night club during the recent UK tour. His final WWE appearance was a loss to Gunner Scott on the May 13 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;. On May 26, 2006, WWE released Jordan from his WWE contract, reportedly due to bringing unauthorized people backstage with him.

=== Independent circuit (2006–2010) ===

Jordan began competing on the independent circuit soon after his WWE departure along with wrestling overseas, most notably for Nu-Wrestling Evolution, a promotion based in Italy, as well as New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Jordan became NWE Champion in April 2008. Later in that month, he was involved in a confrontation with the Ultimate Warrior, leading to the return of Warrior after a ten-year absence to face Jordan in a match in June 2008. Jordan lost the title to Warrior on June 25, 2008, in Barcelona, while holding the honor of being Warrior&#x27;s very last opponent. In 2009, he worked the Hulkamania tour in Australia.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2010–2011) ===

On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night edition of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Impact!&quot; television show Jordan made his debut for the company in a backstage segment with D&#x27;Angelo Dinero. He then as a heel, defeated Dinero in a singles match on the January 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. After scoring an upset victory over Samoa Joe on the February 18 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jordan disappeared from television, before re-surfacing on the March 29 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, debuting a new look and starting the bisexual angle he had proposed to WWE creative before his release from that company. On April 9 Jordan signed a new multi-year contract with TNA. On the May 3 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jordan debuted his new interview segment, O-Zone, during which he attacked and started a feud with the Global Champion Rob Terry. At Sacrifice Jordan challenged Terry for the Global Championship, but was unsuccessful. The following Thursday on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jordan scored a non-title victory over Terry, after capitalizing on Terry&#x27;s injured knee, which he had injured at Sacrifice. Jordan&#x27;s feud with Terry came to an end on the June 3 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when the Global Champion pinned him in a tag team match, where he teamed with Desmond Wolfe and Terry with Abyss.

On the July 21 episode of &quot;Explosion&quot;, Jordan defeated Homicide. On the July 29 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Jordan, himself formed a dysfunctional tag team with face Eric Young, who had been battling (kayfabe) mental problems ever since taking a bump on the head, being completely unaware of Jordan&#x27;s sexual orientation and interest in him. On the September 29 edition of TNA Xplosion, Jordan defeated Suicide. On the September 24 edition of TNA Xplosion, Jordan and Eric Young faced Ink Inc. in a losing effort. This led to a rematch at Bound for Glory. Young&#x27;s antics cost him and Jordan their match against Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore). On the October 15 edition of TNA Xplosion, Jordan and Eric Young defeated Rob Terry and Suicide. On the November 3 edition of TNA Xplosion, Jordan defeated Magnus. Upon the team&#x27;s next appearance on &quot;Impact!&quot; on December 16, Jordan had turned face as he and Young defeated Generation Me (Jeremy and Max Buck) in a tag team match. On April 17, 2011, at Lockdown, Jordan and Young were unsuccessful in becoming the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a four tag team steel cage match, which was won by Ink Inc. On May 12, 2011 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Jordan competed in a battle royal to become the #1 contender for the world heavyweight championship but failed to win the match. On June 28, 2011, Jordan faced Magnus in the 1st round of the Xplosion Championship Challenge but lost the match. After this point, Eric Young went on a singles run and won the TNA Television Championship, the title formerly known as the TNA Global Championship, while Jordan was taken off television. Jordan&#x27;s last TNA match took place on July 2, 2011 at a TNA Live Event where Jordan, Eric Young and Amazing Red defeated Robbie E, Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams in a six-man tag team match. On July 11, 2011, it was reported that Jordan had been released from TNA.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2011–present) ===
On November 5, 2011, at an NWA event, Jordan faced Steve Anthony in a lumberjack match but lost the match. At Outback Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Battle for Ballarat event on May 31, 2013, Jordan defeated Andy Phoenix in what would be his final match before retiring from professional wrestling.

On June 3, 2016, at Menai Mania II, Jordan beat AWE Heavyweight Champion Luke Knight, having qualified for a title opportunity through the Innerwest rumble. He would, however, drop the title to Knight weeks later.

On September 16, 2023 Jordan returned to wrestling with All-Star Wrestling Australia and became the All-Star Wrestling Heavyweight Champion.

== Personal life ==
Jordan was misdiagnosed with autism as a child. He also had speech difficulties, and attended classes to help him overcome them. He competed in gymnastics as a child, and participated in amateur wrestling. He attended Boise State University after winning the 1993 state championship at 189 pounds for Hermitage High School in Richmond, Virginia.

<doc id="983866" wikidata="Q5508053" url="?curid=983866" title="Full Frontal (Australian TV series)">
<text>Full Frontal is an Australian sketch comedy series that ran on the Seven Network from 1993 to 1997. It launched the television careers of Eric Bana, Shaun Micallef, Kitty Flanagan, Julia Morris, Daina Reid and Denise Scott.

In 1998 a spin-off of the show moved to Network Ten under the name Totally Full Frontal, losing most of the original cast in the process; it finished in 1999.

Since 2008 till approx 2010, re-runs were screening on The Comedy Channel as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Aussie Gold&quot; block of locally made, classic comedy programming.

==History==
The series began screening shortly after the similar sketch comedy program &quot;Fast Forward&quot; (from which &quot;Full Frontal&quot; derived) ended. &quot;Full Frontal&quot; retained the same general format of &quot;Fast Forward&quot;. It was formatted in a way such as to create the effect of someone continuously channel surfing; after the punchline of each sketch, it would abruptly switch to the next as if the viewer had switched channels. However, the new show had an all-new regular cast. Initially, some members of the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; cast made guest appearances in occasional &quot;Full Frontal&quot; sketches, easing the transition into the new series. Several members of the new cast had appeared in the earlier &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, including Kym Gyngell and Glenn Butcher.

The show first aired on the Seven Network on 13 May 1993, and finished on 15 September 1997.

==Notable characters==

=== Full Frontal ===
;Peter (or as he pronounces it &quot;Poida&quot; often correcting people by saying &quot;hey it&#x27;s Poida, not Poida&quot;);
: An Australian bogan, played by Eric Bana. Poida was originally a TV host on Community Television&#x27;s Channel 31. Peter enjoys to drink VB and carries an esky around wherever he goes. He has a blond mullet and dresses in a velvet suit. Most of the time he is seen smoking in sketches. Poida works for Channel 31 but is usually the stand-in host for many TV shows on other networks (such as Channel 9, 10, and the ABC) when the real host fails to appear. He has stood in for Ray Martin on &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and Kerry O&#x27;Brien on &quot;The 7.30 Report,&quot; as well as being the host of &quot;Storytime&quot; and an episode of &quot;Playschool.&quot; He takes an esky into the studio and smokes while interviewing guests. Instead of sitting on the set furniture, he prefers to make himself comfortable on a bean bag.
:;Impact on Eric Bana&#x27;s Career:Poida was probably Eric Bana&#x27;s most well known character and was thought to really have helped Bana&#x27;s acting career. The director of the Australian film &quot;Chopper&quot; says he cast Bana because of his performance in &quot;Full Frontal&quot;. Bana has gone on to a successful acting career, starring in movies both in and out of Australia.

;Eddie: Eastern European migrant, whose famous line was &quot;It&#x27;s a complete shemozzle&quot; (also played by Eric Bana). In an interview in &quot;TV Week&quot; Bana said the character was born when he was around 10 or 12 whilst playing on his CB Radio. &quot;Eddie is the sort of guy who could walk through the Mardi Gras and not realise it was gay. He would just see it as coincidental that there were so many men there.&quot;
;Ron: A stage janitor who wears overalls and is always trying to either apply for a job or scam money introducing himself as &quot;uh, Ron&quot;. When he is caught out, he will often leave, saying &quot;Fair enough&quot;. (Played by Ross Williams)

;Milo Kerrigan: Punch-drunk (but much loved) ex-boxer played by Shaun Micallef. He is considered to be the most popular character of the series. Heavily reliant on slapstick sketches involving Kerrigan routinely destroying large portions of the set.

Micallef continued to play the character on his later series The Micallef Program.

<doc id="983869" wikidata="Q1432710" url="?curid=983869" title="Full Frontal (film)">
<text>Full Frontal is a 2002 American comedy-drama film by Steven Soderbergh about a day in the life of a handful of characters in Hollywood. It stars Catherine Keener, Blair Underwood, David Duchovny, Julia Roberts, Mary McCormack, Nicky Katt, Brad Pitt, and David Hyde Pierce. The film was shot on digital video using the Canon XL-1s in under a month. The film blurs the line between what is real and what is fiction in its depiction of a film within a film (and possibly within another).

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was announced in 2001 and Catherine Keener was the first actor attached to the project, named &quot;How to Survive a Hotel Room Fire&quot;. It was billed by Miramax as &quot;an unofficial sequel of sorts&quot; to &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;. In October, Julia Roberts, David Hyde Pierce, and David Duchovny were announced as leads in the project, and after the September 11 attacks, the film title was changed to &quot;The Art of Negotiating a Turn&quot;.

After a phone call with Harvey Weinstein because he did not like the new movie title, Soderbergh suggested the title &quot;Full Frontal&quot;. Production on the film began on November 6, 2001.

The character named Harvey (played by Jeff Garlin) is a reference to Weinstein himself.

==Release==
=== Box office ===

&quot;Full Frontal&quot; had a limited release in the United States on August 2, 2002, opening in 208 theaters, and earning $739,834 its first weekend. The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 23, 2003, and failed to reach the Top 10.

===Critical response===

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 39% based on reviews from 145 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;An confusing movie made worse by the poor camera work.&quot;

Writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert called &quot;Full Frontal&quot; &quot;a film so amateurish that only the professionalism of some of the actors makes it watchable&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer, better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film, that&#x27;s a bad sign. A very bad sign.&quot;

Other critics praised Soderbergh for his experimental approach. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave an overall positive review, but wrote, &quot;&quot;Full Frontal&quot; is a movie about people making movies about movies, and Soderbergh edits so quickly and effortlessly between those layers of reality that a concentrically ordered universe similar to nesting Russian dolls quickly begins to feel more like a hall of mirrors. Watching &quot;Full Frontal&quot; is a vertiginous, disorienting experience, one that reflects its characters with grotesque, funny and sometimes horrifying exaggeration. No matter how much fun it is to watch – and for hard-core movie fans, it is often enormous fun – there&#x27;s a certain relief when it stops and we&#x27;re popped back out to our banal, one-track lives.&quot;

&quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, recommending it for its &quot;humor and talented cast&quot;.

====Retrospective reviews====
In 2016, Lawrence Garcia wrote in an essay for Mubi that the film’s amateurish filming techniques were precisely Soderbergh’s point, saying &quot;Full Frontal&quot; &quot;is a film about aesthetics, or more specifically the phoniness of it; that is, it’s concerned mainly with the gulf between an object, its presentation, and interpretation, with the L.A. lifestyle (which includes a neighbor that perpetually wears a Dracula costume) providing the perfect backdrop.&quot; Garcia did say the film’s &quot;major flaw is that while individual scenes are often amusing, the film as a whole never quite coheres.&quot;

For the 20th anniversary of the film, writer Craig J. Clark noted &quot;the parallels between [the behavior of the character Gus]…and the accusations leveled at executive producer Harvey Weinstein, one of the handful of sexual predators ensnared by the #MeToo movement whose punishment appears to be sticking. What makes the film especially curious as a cultural artifact is Gus is not its only Weinstein stand-in&quot;, referring to Garlin’s character, as well.

<text>NGC 3184, the Little Pinwheel Galaxy, is an unbarred spiral galaxy approximately 40 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. Its name comes from its resemblance to the Pinwheel Galaxy. It was discovered on 18 March 1787 by German-British astronomer William Herschel. It has two HII regions named NGC 3180 and NGC 3181.

NGC 3184 houses a high abundance of heavy elements. The blue color of its spiral arms comes mostly from relatively few bright young blue stars. The bright stars that highlight the arms were created in huge density waves that circle the center.

==Structure==
NGC 3184 has two prominent spiral arms. They have constant pitch angles, which makes them both symmetrical.

== Supernovae and Astronomical Transients ==
Seven supernovae and astronomical transients have been observed in NGC 3184:
* SN 1921B (type unknown, mag. 13.5) was discovered by Fritz Zwicky on 6 April 1921.
* SN 1921C (type unknown, mag. 11) was discovered on 5 December 1921.
* SN 1937F (type unknown, mag. 13.5) was discovered by Fritz Zwicky on 9 December 1937.
* SN 1999gi (type II, mag. 14) was discovered by Reiki Kushida on 9 December 1999.
* SN 2010dn (type ILRT, mag. 17) was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 31 May 2010.
* SN 2016bkv (type II, mag. 17.2), was discovered by Kōichi Itagaki on 21 March 2016.
* AT 2019sfe (type unknown, mag. 20.6) was discovered on 8 October 2019.

=== SN 2010dn ===
On May 31, 2010, Kōichi Itagaki detected a magnitude 17 optical transient 33&quot; east and 61&quot; north of the center of NGC 3184 at coordinates 10 18 19.89 +41 26 28.8. Designated SN 2010dn, this event was initially thought to be an outbursting luminous blue variable (LBV) star, but later analysis categorized it as an intermediate-luminosity red transient (ILRT), also known as a luminous red nova. Archival Hubble and Spitzer images of NGC 3184 seem to show no progenitor for optical transient SN 2010dn. SN 2010dn is just like SN 2008S and NGC 300-OT. On day 2, SN 2010dn had an unfiltered magnitude of 17.1, corresponding to a peak absolute magnitude of roughly -13.3.

<doc id="983885" wikidata="Q2250449" url="?curid=983885" title="Schröter (lunar crater)">
<text>Schröter is a lunar impact crater near the mid-part of the Moon, on the eastern Mare Insularum. It was named after German astronomer Johann Hieronymus Schröter. It lies to the north of the craters Sömmering and Mösting. To the southeast of the crater rim is a rille named the Rima Schröter. This cleft begins at a small crater in the mare, then follows a line to the south-southeast.

The rim of Schröter is heavily worn and eroded, with a wide gap in the southern wall and a deep indentation to the southeast. There is no central peak at the crater&#x27;s midpoint. A widely spaced row of tiny craters forms a line westwards from the north rim of Schröter.

Professor W. H. Pickering produced drawings of this crater displaying eruptions of steam that he believed he witnessed. This transient lunar phenomenon was not confirmed by other observers.

To the north of Schröter, beginning with the satellite crater Schröter W, is a region of irregular terrain. This area includes an array of linear dark surface markings that appear to criss-cross. In the 19th century, Franz von Paula Gruithuisen is noted for claiming that this area contained a lunar city (which he called &quot;Wallwerk&quot;), based on his observations using a small refracting telescope. This inference was greeted with considerable skepticism by astronomers at the time, and, indeed, subsequent observations with more powerful instruments demonstrated that this was merely a natural feature.

About 100 km to the west-northwest of Schröter is the crash site of Surveyor 2.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schröter.

<text>Sharp is a lunar impact crater located to the west of the Sinus Iridum bay of the Mare Imbrium, beyond the Montes Jura range. To the southwest is the crater Mairan. Because of its location and foreshortening, Sharp appears elliptical from the earth.

Sharp is surrounded by a rugged region of mountains and rises. Ridges are joined to the north and south ends of the rim. The crater has a low central peak at the midpoint of the floor. Between Sharp and Sharp A is an unnamed sinuous rille. The more distant Rima Sharp is located on the Mare Frigoris to the northwest.

Sharp is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sharp.

<text>Sheepshanks is a small lunar impact crater located near the northern edge of Mare Frigoris. Due south on the opposite shore is the prominent crater Aristoteles while to the north is C. Mayer. Sheepshanks appears somewhat oblong due to foreshortening, but it is actually nearly circular. The inner walls slope down to a ring of material around the inner floor. There is a small craterlet along the southeastern inner wall. The crater is otherwise not particularly eroded by impacts.

About to the southeast of the crater rim is the western end of the narrow rille named Rima Sheepshanks. This cleft extends for a distance of about across the surface of the mare, running to the east-northeast.

The craters are named for Anne Sheepshanks who was a benefactor to the Royal Astronomical Society. Despite being overlooked for membership of the society her contribution is recorded in the naming of these craters.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sheepshanks.

<text>Suess is a small lunar impact crater on the Oceanus Procellarum. It is a circular, cup-shaped feature with a higher albedo than the surroundings. The closest significant crater is Reiner, about 150 kilometers to the west-northwest. The lunar mare that surrounds Suess is marked by the rays radiating from the crater Kepler to the east-northeast.

The long, sinuous rille named Rima Suess begins about 30 kilometers to the east of Suess, and winds its way in a generally north-northwesterly direction for a length of almost 200 kilometers.

It was named after the 1st century Roman historian and writer Tacitus. Directly west is the crater Almanon, and to the northeast is Cyrillus. To the southeast of Tacitus is a long chain of craters named the Catena Abulfeda. This chain runs to the northwest from the eastern edge of the Rupes Altai, continuing for over 200 kilometers.

The crater terminates a ridge which forms part of the Rupes Altai. The outer wall has a small , and the interior surfaces are d. The rim outline has a slight polygonal outline. There is a low ridge on the crater floor running from the north wall.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tacitus.

<text>NGC 6946, sometimes referred to as the Fireworks Galaxy, is a face-on intermediate spiral galaxy with a small bright nucleus, whose location in the sky straddles the boundary between the northern constellations of Cepheus and Cygnus. Its distance from Earth is about 25.2 million light-years or 7.72 megaparsecs, similar to the distance of M101 (NGC 5457) in the constellation Ursa Major. Both were once considered to be part of the Local Group, but are now known to be among the dozen bright spiral galaxies near the Milky Way but beyond the confines of the Local Group. NGC 6946 lies within the Virgo Supercluster.

The galaxy was discovered by William Herschel on 9 September 1798. Based on an estimation by the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3) in 1991, the galaxy has a D25 B-band isophotal diameter of . It is heavily obscured by interstellar matter due to its location close to the galactic plane of the Milky Way. Due to its prodigious star formation it has been classified as an active starburst galaxy. NGC 6946 has also been classified as a double-barred spiral galaxy, with the inner, smaller bar presumably responsible for funneling gas into its center.

Various unusual celestial objects have been observed within NGC 6946. This includes the so-called &#x27;Red Ellipse&#x27; along one of the northern arms that looks like a super-bubble or very large supernova remnant, and which may have been formed by an open cluster containing massive stars. There are also two regions of unusual dark lanes of nebulosity, while within the spiral arms several regions appear devoid of stars and gaseous hydrogen, some spanning up to two kiloparsecs across. A third peculiar object, discovered in 1967, is now known as &quot;Hodge&#x27;s Complex&quot;. This was once thought to be a young supergiant cluster, but in 2017 it was conjectured to be an interacting dwarf galaxy superimposed on NGC 6946.

==Supernovae==
Ten supernovae have been observed in NGC 6946 in the 20th and early 21st century: SN 1917A, SN 1939C, SN 1948B, SN 1968D, SN 1969P, SN 1980K, SN 2002hh, SN 2004et, SN 2008S, and SN 2017eaw. For this reason, NGC 6946 has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Fireworks Galaxy&quot;. This is about ten times the rate observed in our Milky Way galaxy, even though the Milky Way has twice as many stars as NGC 6946.

On 27 September 2004, the Type II supernova SN 2004et was observed at magnitude 15.2 and rose to a maximum visual magnitude of 12.7. Images taken during the preceding days revealed that the supernova explosion occurred on 22 September. The progenitor of the supernova was identified on earlier images –– only the seventh time that such an event was directly identified with its host star. The red supergiant progenitor had an initial mass of about 15 in an interacting binary system shared with a blue supergiant.

During 2009, a bright star within NGC 6946 flared up over several months to become over one million times as bright as the Sun. Shortly thereafter it faded rapidly. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the star did not survive, although there remains some infrared emission from its position. This is thought to come from debris falling onto a black hole that formed when the star died. This potential black hole-forming star is designated N6946-BH1. The progenitor is believed to have been a yellow hypergiant star.

In May 2017, supernova SN 2017eaw was detected in the northwest region of the galaxy, and light curves obtained over the next 600 days showed that it was a Type II-P. The progenitor was determined to have been a red supergiant, with a mass of around 15.

As of 2017, more supernovae had been seen in NGC 6946 than in any other galaxy, a record that has since been surpassed by NGC 3690.

<text>Mont-Saint-Aignan () is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the region of Normandy, northwestern France.

The inhabitants of the town of Mont-Saint-Aignan are called &quot;Mont-Saint-Aignanais&quot; in French.

Due to the presence of higher education institutions (notably the University of Rouen and the NEOMA Business School) and the city&#x27;s relatively small population, Mont-Saint-Aignan is considered the French city that has the largest proportion of students relative to its population (students represented in 2014 25,61% of the total population).

==Geography==
The town is the fifth-largest suburb of the city of Rouen and lies directly adjacent to the north side of Rouen at the junction of the D121 and D43. In addition to its population of 21,265, there are also around 20,000 students at the university and the various &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;.

==History==
The town is ultimately named for the ancient Saint Aignan of Orleans.

The parishes of Saint-Aignan () and Mont-aux-Malades (Monte Infirmorum, which takes its name from a hospital) are mentioned in documents dating back to the 12th century. Henry II built a church there dedicated to Thomas Becket in 1176 in an attempt to make up for his unwitting role in the murder of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The modern commune of Mont-Saint-Aignan was created in the early 19th century (1815–1819) out of the merger of the communes of Monts-aux-Malades, Saint-Aignan and (partly) Saint-Denis-de-Bondeville.

<text>The Manhunters are a fictional race of extraterrestrial robots that appear in titles published by DC Comics.

==Publication history==
The broader history behind the alien robot species covered in this article was introduced in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #140 (March 1977), in a story by Steve Englehart and Dick Dillin.

==Fictional character biography==

===Interstellar police===

The Manhunters are the first attempt of the Guardians of the Universe to create an interstellar police force that could combat evil all over the cosmos. Their name and much of their code of behavior is modeled by the Guardians of the Universe on the Manhunters of Ma&#x27;aleca&#x27;andra (Mars) millions of years ago. For thousands of years, they serve the Guardians well. However, as the Manhunters become more intelligent and self-aware, they begin to resent the limitations placed upon them by the Guardians; in their eyes, justice is less important than the hunting and punishment of those they deem wicked.

===Exile===
Eventually, the robots conspire to rebel against their masters, but the Guardians do defeat and destroy most of them. Those who survived hide away on many planets, slowly rebuilding their forces and spreading their beliefs to others. Since then, the over-riding goal of the Manhunters has been to take revenge on the Guardians, as well as on their replacements, the Green Lantern Corps.

The Manhunters infiltrate and liberate many planets disguised as living beings and create a &quot;Cult of the Manhunters&quot; that trains others to be their minions. On Mars, the people of that world start a group of Martian Manhunters based on the lessons of preserving justice taught unto them by the Manhunters and even erect a temple based on the appearance of their inspiration. On Earth, most of the Manhunters&#x27; agents are unaware that their masters are robots, or that their real purposes are not noble. Some of these agents became superheroes also known as Manhunters. They wear red-and-blue costumes patterned after the Manhunters themselves. The most famous of these is a big game hunter called Paul Kirk. He is active in the 1940s, and stars in his own series. The character is brought back in a modern version in the 70s, in which he was supposedly killed years before but was in truth placed in suspended animation by a secret conspiracy. He is cloned, and when he finally reawakes, he dedicates himself to battling those who had used him. He dies in the process, but some of his clones survived.

The Manhunters are discovered by the Justice League who seemingly defeats the Manhunter&#x27;s leader, the Grandmaster. One of their human pawns, Mark Shaw, adopts a new identity as the costumed hero, the Privateer but is later discovered to be a criminal posing as a hero.

In &quot;The World of Smallville&quot; miniseries, the Manhunters tracked Superman before and after he arrived on Earth.

===Millennium===

Years later, it is revealed that the Manhunters not only still exist, but have infiltrated the lives of most superheroes with their agents. They even manage to infiltrate the Olympian Gods, one of their number posing as the goat god Pan, as shown during the &quot;Challenge of the Gods&quot; storyline. They reveal themselves when a Guardian and a member of the Zamarons try to evolve some humans into becoming the next Guardians of the Universe, during what becomes known as the Millennium crisis. On this occasion, there is a massive counterstrike operation by the heroes against the Manhunters, and it seems that the Grandmaster has finally been destroyed, along with their hidden home planet. Former Privateer Mark Shaw readopts his identity as Manhunter in the wake of the battle, seeking to redeem both the name and himself.

===Post-Emerald Twilight===
Kyle Rayner encounters the Manhunters not long after Hal Jordan&#x27;s destruction of the Guardians and the Central Power Battery on Oa. The first of the androids encounters a still inexperienced Kyle Rayner and is almost able to defeat him using brute force until Kyle uses his wits to outsmart and destroy it (Green Lantern (vol. 3) #117). The next time, multiple Manhunters appear. They are all sentient individuals, upgraded by a passing alien ship with technology onboard that gives them a hive consciousness. They capture Kyle in an attempt to use his last remaining Green Lantern ring for their purposes. They fail and Kyle manages to escape (Green Lantern (vol. 3) #129-131).

===Sector 3601===
When the Manhunters are replaced by the Green Lantern Corps, they retreat to Biot, their homeworld in Sector 3601, an uncharted area of space incapable of sustaining organic life. Hank Henshaw, the Cyborg Superman, comes to Biot and becomes the Manhunters&#x27; new Grandmaster. He uses his mastery over machinery and Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters with organic enhancements, resulting behavioral developments such as emotions. They seem to have rebuilt the first Central Power Battery originally destroyed by Hal Jordan (under the influence of Parallax). Henshaw decides not to interfere in the reformation of the Green Lantern Corps after an encounter between a Manhunter and Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner.

===Sinestro Corps===

The Manhunters later resurface as part of the Sinestro Corps. Some of them carry miniature yellow Power Batteries inside them which are used by the Sinestro Corps members to charge their yellow power rings while others still carry the green ones for taking powers from the Green Lanterns&#x27; rings.

===Secret Origin===
In the &quot;Green Lantern: Secret Origin&quot; storylines (which revises Hal Jordan&#x27;s beginnings), it is revealed that the Manhunters suffered a programming glitch that caused them to wipe out all life in space sector 666, believing it to be evil. It is this event that gives rise to the Five Inversions, the only survivors of the massacre, who vow to make the Guardians pay for what their creations had done.

===Blackest Night===
During the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, it is revealed that Amanda Waller and King Faraday have a deactivated Manhunter in their possession, having recovered it from the Belle Reve swamp after the &quot;Millennium&quot; event (which the Suicide Squad had a hand in stopping). Waller sends the Manhunter to Belle Reve to assist the Secret Six and the Suicide Squad in their battle with members of the Black Lantern Corps. Waller ultimately uses a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the Manhunter, unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.

===Brightest Day===
It is eventually revealed that the programming glitch the Manhunters suffered was caused by Krona to prove to the other Guardians of the Universe that there are flaws in an emotionless police force.

===The New 52===
During &quot;The New 52&quot;, while running from the Alpha Lanterns, John Stewart and Guy Gardner find dozens of deactivated Manhunters in the Guardian&#x27;s Ring Foundry. They re-energize the robots using the Foundry essence to fend off the Alphas. However, during the fight, the Manhunters are accidentally fused in a massive bio-mechanic monster. It has since been revealed that the Manhunters were created to apprehend the First Lantern during a time the Maltusians were still trying to harness the Emerald Light of Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum which they eventually would use as a source of energy to fuel their efforts to police the cosmos.

==Chant==
The Manhunters have had a mixture of oaths over the years: &quot;&quot;No evil escapes the Manhunters!&quot;, &quot;Death to the Green Lantern Corps!&quot;, and &quot;No man escapes the Manhunters!&quot;&quot;

==Highmaster==

The Highmaster is the supreme Manhunter which appeared on Orinda in &quot;Justice League International&quot; #10. He resembles a gigantic yellow manhunter and was destroyed by Hal Jordan and Superman.

==Technology==
*Manhunter technology has been used in the creation of the OMAC drones. The Kryptonian technology was incorporated into the Manhunters by Hank Henshaw on Biot, which enabled them to use the Central Power Battery on Oa as a power source for the Manhunters.
*Originally the Manhunters used special energy pistols which were charged by the Green Lanterns which they carried.

==Other versions==

* The Manhunters appear in &quot;Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War&quot;.
* The Manhunters appear in &quot;Green Lantern: Earth One&quot;. These versions were created by the Guardians of Oa to replace the Corps, who they felt had become too independent.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Manhunters appear in the &quot;Justice League&quot; episode &quot;In Blackest Night&quot;, with their leader voiced by James Remar. This version of the group were reprogrammed to perform other tasks due to being unable to understand morality, but secretly plotted revenge against the Guardians. They and Kanjar Ro frame Green Lantern John Stewart for the destruction of the planet Ajuris 4 and attempt to absorb the Central Battery&#x27;s power, but are ultimately defeated by him.
* The Manhunters appear in &quot;Green Lantern: The Animated Series&quot;, voiced by Josh Keaton. This version of the group seek to destroy all emotions, believing them to be the source of evil, and later become the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s minions.
