<text>Rogers&#x27; Rangers was a company of soldiers from the Province of New Hampshire raised by Major Robert Rogers and attached to the British Army during the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War). The unit was quickly adopted into the New England Colonies army as an independent ranger company. Rogers was inspired by colonial Frontiersman Ranger groups across North America and the teachings of unconventional warfare from Rangers such as Benjamin Church.
Robert Rogers trained and commanded his own rapidly deployable light infantry force, which was tasked mainly with reconnaissance as well as conducting special operations against distant targets. Their tactics were built on earlier Colonial precedents and were codified for the first time by Rogers as his 28 &quot;Rules of Ranging&quot;. The tactics proved remarkably effective, so much so that the initial company was expanded into a ranging corps of more than a dozen companies (containing as many as 1,200–1,400 men at its peak). The ranger corps became the chief scouting arm of British Crown forces by the late 1750s. The British forces in America valued Rogers&#x27; Rangers for their ability to gather intelligence about the enemy. They were disbanded in 1761. 

Later, the company was revived as a Loyalist force during the American Revolutionary War. Nonetheless, a number of former ranger officers fought for the Continental Army as Patriot commanders with some participating as militiamen at the Battle of Concord Bridge.

The Queen&#x27;s York Rangers (1st American Regiment) of the Canadian Army, formed by Rogers and Loyalist veterans of Rogers&#x27; Rangers, claims descent from Rogers&#x27; Rangers.

==French and Indian War==

Rogers&#x27; Rangers began in 1755 as a company in the provincial forces of the colony of New Hampshire in British North America. It was the latest in a long line of New England ranger companies dating back to the 1670s. The immediate precursor and model for the unit was Gorham&#x27;s Rangers, formed in 1744. Both were initially organized by William Shirley. Gorham&#x27;s Rangers are always depicted as precursors of Rogers&#x27; Rangers; however, they were also active throughout the French and Indian War, which makes them contemporaries of Rogers&#x27; Rangers. In fact, the Nova Scotia ranger corps that Gorham&#x27;s company belonged to operated in cooperation with units of Rogers&#x27; corps on several occasions, most notably when Moses Hazen&#x27;s company joined Rogers&#x27; Rangers at the Siege of Louisburg in 1758 and the Siege of Quebec in 1759. Rogers&#x27; company was formed to fight in the French and Indian War (the Seven Years&#x27; War in Canada, Britain, and Europe) in the borderlands of the colonial Northeast. They were commanded by Captain (later Major) Robert Rogers and operated primarily in the Lake George and Lake Champlain regions of New York. The unit was formed during the winter of 1755 from forces stationed at Fort William Henry. The Rangers sometimes undertook raids against French towns and military emplacements, traveling on foot, in whaleboats, and even on snowshoes during winter. Israel Putnam (who would go on to later fame in the Revolutionary War) fought as a Connecticut militia captain in conjunction with Rogers, and at one point saved his life.

The usefulness of Rogers&#x27; company during 1756 and 1757 prompted the British to form a second ranger company, which was soon followed by more. By early 1758, the rangers had been expanded to a corps of fourteen companies composed of between 1,200 and 1,400 men. This included three all-Indian units, two of Stockbridge Mahicans and one of Indians from Connecticut (mainly Mohegan and Pequot). Rogers was then promoted to major and served as commandant of the Ranger Corps.

=== First Battle on Snowshoes ===
On January 21, 1757, during the First Battle on Snowshoes, Rogers led 74 rangers to ambush the French, capturing seven prisoners near Fort Carillon at the south end of Lake Champlain. They then were attacked by about 100 French and Canadien (French Canadian) militia and their Ottawa allies from the Ohio Country. Rogers&#x27; men suffered casualties and retreated without further losses, since the French lacked snowshoes and were &quot;floundering in snow up to their knees.&quot; Rogers&#x27; Rangers had maintained positions on the high ground and behind large trees. According to Francis Parkman, Ranger casualties were 14 killed, 6 captured, and 6 wounded, the wounded returning with 48 men who were unharmed. The French consisted of 89 Regulars and 90 Canadians and Indians; they had 37 killed and wounded. The French and Indian casualties may have included one of the captured prisoners. One wounded and captured Ranger who was later exchanged claimed to have killed one of the captured Frenchmen by striking him on the head with a tomahawk after the Rangers were ambushed. It is unclear if this was the fate of the other captured French as well.

A company of the rangers led by Noah Johnson was stationed at Fort William Henry in 1757 during the siege. The siege ended with the surrender and massacre of the British forces in August. After this, the Rangers were stationed on Rogers Island near Fort Edward. This allowed them to train and operate with more freedom than the regular forces.

=== Second Battle on Snowshoes ===
On March 13, 1758, at the Second Battle on Snowshoes, Rogers&#x27; Rangers ambushed a French-Indian column and were then ambushed in turn by enemy forces. The Rangers lost 125 men in this encounter, as well as eight men wounded, with 52 surviving. One reference reports casualties of the Regulars, who had volunteered to accompany the Rangers, as 2 captured and 5 killed. Of Rogers&#x27; Rangers, 78 were captured and 47 killed and missing (of whom 19 were captured). Rogers estimated 100 killed and nearly 100 wounded of the French-Indian forces. The French, however, reported their casualties as just 10 Indians killed and 17 wounded, and three Canadians wounded.

The French originally reported killing Rogers in the second battle. This was based on their finding some of his belongings, including his regimental coat containing his military commission; however, he had escaped. This episode gave rise to the legend of Rogers&#x27; sliding down the side of a mountain to the frozen surface of Lake George. There is no conclusive proof this actually happened, but the rock face is still known as &quot;Rogers&#x27; Slide&quot; or &quot;Rogers Rock&quot;.

=== Siege of Louisbourg ===
Four companies of Rogers Rangers (500 rangers) arrived on the provincial vessel &quot;King George&quot; and were at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia from April 8 until May 28, awaiting the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). While there, they scoured the woods to stop raids on the capital. During the Siege, the rangers were the first to go ashore at Freshwater Cover and encountered 100 Mi&#x27;kmaq and French soldiers. James Wolfe and Scott followed up the rangers. The Rangers killed and scalped the Chief Mi&#x27;kmaq. In their retreat, the rangers captured 70 defenders and killed more than 50. Historian Burt Loescher describes this as &quot;one of the most admirable feats ever performed by a detachment of the Corps.&quot;

=== Carillon and Crown Point ===
On July 7–8, 1758, Rogers&#x27; Rangers took part in the Battle of Carillon. On July 27, 1758, between Fort Edward and Half-Way Brook, 300 Indians and 200 French/Canadians under Captain St. Luc ambushed a British convoy. The British lost 116 killed (including 16 Rangers) and 60 captured.

On August 8, 1758, near Crown Point, New York, a British force of Rangers, light infantry, and provincials was ambushed by a French-Canadian-Indian force of 450 under Captain Marin. In this action, Major Israel Putnam was captured. He was reportedly saved from burning at the stake by the Abenaki through the intervention of a French officer and a providential thunderstorm. Francis Parkman reported 49 British fatalities and &quot;more than a hundred&quot; killed of the enemy. Rogers claimed the British losses were 33 and that those of the enemy as 199. Another source reports that the French casualties were four Indians and six Canadians killed, and four Indians and six Canadians wounded, including an officer and a cadet.

=== Raid on Saint-Francis ===
During 1759, the Rangers were involved in one of their most famous operations, the St. Francis Raid. They had been ordered to destroy the Abenaki settlement of Saint-Francis in Quebec. It was the base of the raids and attacks on British settlements. Rogers led a force of 200 Rangers from Crown Point deep into French territory. Following the October 3, 1759 attack and successful destruction of Saint-Francis, Rogers&#x27; force ran out of food on their retreat through the wilderness of northern New England. They reached a safe location along the Connecticut River at the abandoned Fort Wentworth, where Rogers left them encamped. He returned a few days later with food and relief forces from Fort at Number 4 (now Charlestown, New Hampshire), the nearest British outpost.

In the raid on Saint-Francis, Rogers claimed 200 enemies had been killed, leaving 20 women and children to be taken prisoner; he took five children as captives and released the rest. The French recorded 30 deaths, including 20 women and children. According to Francis Parkman, Ranger casualties in the attack were one killed and six wounded; in the retreat, five were captured from one band of Rangers, and nearly all in another party of about 20 Rangers were killed or captured. One source alleges that only about 100 returned of about 204 Rangers, allies, and observers.

===Raid on Sainte-Thérèse===

In the Spring of 1760 the Rangers joined in Amherst&#x27;s campaign on Montreal but before doing so conducted a successful preemptive raid on Fort Sainte Thérèse which was used to supply the French army as well as being a vital link in the communication and supply line between Fort Saint-Jean and the French forces at Île aux Noix. The settlement and fort were then burned by Rogers following which French and Indian ambushes were repelled before their return to Crown Point with only minor losses.

===Montreal Campaign===

Roger&#x27;s Rangers were part of William Haviland&#x27;s force who marched from Lake Ontario in the west along the St Lawrence River and from upper New York via the Richelieu River in August. Along the way the Rangers fought to reduce the fortified French island of Île aux Noix. During the bombardment of the island Haviland sent Rogers&#x27; four ranger companies as well as light infantry and a force of Indians to drag three cannon through the forest and swamps further down to the rear of the French position. With much difficulty this was achieved and in a few days the guns were planted on the river-bank where a French naval force stood defending it. Rogers&#x27; cannon opened up upon these vessels surprising them; the closest sloop cut her cable and a strong west wind then drove her ashore into the hands of the British. The other vessels and gunboats made all sail downstream but stranded in a bend of the river, where the rangers, swimming out with their tomahawks, boarded and took one of them, and the rest soon surrendered. With their communications cut the French evacuated the island which then fell to the British. Soon after the Forts of Saint Jean and Chambly were burned by the French; the Rangers then led the final advance on Montreal which surrendered without a fight the following month.

==Pontiac&#x27;s War==

At the end of the war, the Rangers were given the task of taking command of Fort Detroit from the French forces. After the war, most of the Rangers returned to civilian life. In 1763, Rogers recruited several volunteers for the reinforcement of Detroit commanded by James Dalyell of the 1st Royal Regiment and formerly of the 80th Regiment of Light Armed Foot (Gage&#x27;s Light Infantry). Upon arrival at Detroit, Dalyell talked post Commandant Henry Gladwin into allowing Dalyell to take his reinforcements to attack an Indian village near Parent&#x27;s Creek. The force of 250–300 soldiers of the 55th and 60th regiments, Rogers&#x27; volunteers, and the Queen&#x27;s Royal American Rangers under the command of Captain Joseph Hopkins was ambushed, as the advanced guard made up of men from the 55th regiment crossed the bridge at Parent&#x27;s Creek. Rogers&#x27; men were responsible for effectively covering the retreat of the force back to Fort Detroit.

==American War of Independence==
When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Robert Rogers offered his services to General George Washington. However, Washington turned him down, fearing he might be a spy, since Rogers had just returned from a long stay in England. Infuriated by the rejection, Rogers offered his services to the British, who accepted. He formed the Queen&#x27;s Rangers (1776) and later the King&#x27;s Rangers. Rogers was instrumental in the capture of Nathan Hale in September 1776.

Several of his former rangers served under General Benedict Arnold in the revolutionary forces around Lake Champlain.

==Legacy==
After the conclusion of the American War of Independence, Rogers Rangers were granted tracts of land for farming in what is now Pownal, Prince Edward Island, Canada. 

The Rangers were reactivated as part of the Regular Army during the War of 1812.

The Queen&#x27;s York Rangers (1st American Regiment) of the Canadian Army claim to be descended from Rogers&#x27; Rangers. Also claiming descent from Rogers&#x27; Rangers are the 1st Battalion 119th Field Artillery of Michigan and the U.S. Army Rangers. 

Rogers&#x27; Rangers are featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 56) along New Hampshire Route 10 in Haverhill.

==In popular culture==
* Kenneth Roberts&#x27; historical novel &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1937) portrays the events of Rogers&#x27; Rangers&#x27; raid on the Abenaki town of St. Francis. The first half of the novel was adapted as the film &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940), starring Spencer Tracy as Rogers.
* During the Second World War, the U.S. Army was interested in the tactics of the British Commando units. Recalling the colonial unit, they took the name &quot;Rangers&quot; as the official title; these units consider Rogers their founding father and distribute copies of Rogers&#x27; Rangers Standing Orders to all aspiring Ranger students.
*The film &quot;Fort Ti&quot; (1953) stars George Montgomery and Irving Bacon as Rangers rescuing hostages held in Fort Ticonderoga during the Seven Years&#x27; War.
* The film Mission of Danger portrays a Rogers&#x27; Rangers operation with actor Keith Larsen portraying Robert Rogers.
* The Methuen High School in Massachusetts uses the nickname &quot;Rangers&quot;. The town was the birthplace of Robert Rogers.
* AMC&#x27;s 2014 TV series &quot;&quot; portrays Rogers&#x27; Rangers as a Loyalist militia that uses intelligence gathered from an unidentified spy inside the Continental Army to ambush its patrols. Robert Rogers remarks early in the first episode that he offered his services first to George Washington, but Washington was unwilling to pay what Rogers demanded.
* In the video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Rogue&quot; (2014), a Rogers&#x27; Rangers outfit dubbed the &quot;raider outfit&quot;, complete with their signature green uniforms and a black beret with the initials &quot;RR&quot;, is available to be unlocked by the player.

<text>Brian Asawa (October 1, 1966 – April 18, 2016) was an American countertenor. &quot;Opera News&quot; said that &quot;in his prime, Asawa was an electric performer, his fearless performing style supported by a voice of arresting beauty and expressivity.&quot;

==Early life==
Brian Asawa was born in Fullerton, California, and grew up in Los Angeles. He sang in the choir at a Methodist church with a Japanese congregation. He began his studies as a piano major at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and then changed his studies to voice, studying under tenor Harlan Hokin. After two semesters there he transferred to UCLA.

In 1989, he began a master&#x27;s degree in early-music interpretation at the University of Southern California where he was a pupil of the American lutenist James Tyler. However, Asawa never finished this program as his performance career began to take off.

==Career==
His career was launched in 1991 when he became the first countertenor to win both the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and an Adler Fellowship to the San Francisco Opera&#x27;s Merola Opera Program. Of his performance at the Metropolitan Allan Kozinn wrote:
Asawa made his professional opera debut at the San Francisco Opera in 1991 in Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Das verratene Meer&quot; where he also sang the Shepherd in &quot;Tosca&quot; and Oberon in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1992. While at the SFO he continued voice studies with Jane Randolph. He also made his first opera appearance in New York City in 1992 at the Mozart Bicentennial celebration at Lincoln Center, singing the title role in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Ascanio in Alba&quot; with the Mostly Mozart Festival Chorus and the New York Chamber Symphony under conductor Ádám Fischer.

In 1993, Asawa was awarded a career grant from the Richard Tucker Music Foundation and made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera as Arsamene in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Xerxes&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; in January 1994 Alex Ross wrote: 
Later that year, Asawa became the first countertenor to win the Operalia International Opera Competition, and made debuts at the Metropolitan Opera as the Voice of Apollo in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and at Glimmerglass Opera as Ottone in Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;. He was chosen Seattle Opera&#x27;s Artist of the Year for the 1996–97 season.

Other career highlights included Orlofsky in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at San Francisco Opera and San Diego Opera; Tolomeo in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at Metropolitan Opera, Bordeaux, Opera Australia, Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Paris Opera, Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, and Hamburg State Opera; Arsamene in &quot;Serse&quot; at Los Angeles, Cologne, Seattle, and Geneva; the title role in &quot;Admeto&quot; at Sydney, Montpellier and Halle; Baba The Turk in &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; at San Francisco and for Swedish television; Fyodor in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; at the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Endimione in La Calisto in Brussels, Oberon in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at San Francisco, Houston, London Symphony Orchestra and Lyon; Ascanio in &quot;Ascanio in Alba&quot; at Lincoln Center; Farnace in &quot;Mitridate, re di Ponto&quot; at Opera National de Lyon and Paris Opera; Nero in &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; in Sydney; Orfeo in &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, La Speranza in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and L&#x27;Umana Fragilita/Anfinomo in &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; at Netherlands Opera; David in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Saul&quot; and Belize in the opera &quot;Angels in America&quot; by Péter Eötvös at the Bavarian State Opera, and Sesto in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; at COC in Toronto.

Asawa not only performed in opera, but was interested in expanding the art song literature for countertenor, supporting living composers by commissioning, performing, and recording works by them. Perhaps best known is the song cycle &quot;Encountertenor&quot;, commissioned from Jake Heggie and premiered at London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall in 1995 (later recording it for the RCA Red Seal label). Asawa also recorded a disc of songs by Ned Rorem with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra for RCA. More recently, Asawa sang San Francisco composer Kurt Erickson&#x27;s &quot;Four Arab Love Songs&quot; (a mini-cycle of medieval Arab poems from Spain’s Andalusia region dating from 900 to 1100 AD) on a premiere tour consisting of concerts in Long Beach, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, California and in Washington State. At the time of his death, Asawa was slated to premiere the song cycle &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot; (12 songs on texts from the plays of Shakespeare) written for him by Connecticut composer Juliana Hall at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival in celebration of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s death.

In May 2014, Asawa performed a recital program with mezzo-soprano Diana Tash at the Festival de Mayo in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 2014, Asawa and Peter Somogyi established Asawa and Associates, an operatic artists&#x27; management agency.

==Personal life and death==
Asawa was openly gay and believed this had helped him discover his voice type. &quot;Heterosexual men don&#x27;t feel comfortable singing in a treble register because it&#x27;s not butch&quot;, he told an interviewer in 1998. &quot;Gay men feel quite comfortable singing in their falsetto registers.&quot; He was married to Keith Fisher; the marriage ended in divorce.

Asawa was the nephew of sculptor Ruth Asawa. His cause of death was reported as heart and liver failure. He died in Mission Hills on April 18, 2016, at the age of 49.

==Recordings==

Asawa&#x27;s discography includes solo recital discs for RCA Victor Red Seal ranging from Dowland and Edmund Campion to Rachmaninoff and Ned Rorem. His opera recordings include Farnace in &quot;Mitridate&quot; for Decca, Arsamene in &quot;Serse&quot; for Conifer and Oberon in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; for Philips with the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Colin Davis.

Asawa appeared on DVD in Ligeti&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in Patria&quot; Opus Arte, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; Kultur, as well as both a CD and DVD release of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; directed by Marc Minkowski. In 2014, Asawa and mezzo-soprano Diana Tash released an album of duets on the LML Music label that included works by Handel, Monteverdi, Purcell, A. Scarlatti and Marco da Gagliano.

<doc id="981118" wikidata="Q1314158" url="?curid=981118" title="Idaho National Laboratory">
<text>Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is one of the national laboratories of the United States Department of Energy and is managed by the Battelle Energy Alliance. Historically, the lab has been involved with nuclear research, although the laboratory does other research as well. Much of current knowledge about how nuclear reactors behave and misbehave was discovered at what is now Idaho National Laboratory. John Grossenbacher, former INL director, said, &quot;The history of nuclear energy for peaceful application has principally been written in Idaho&quot;. The present facility resulted from the 2005 merger of two neighboring laboratories, the National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and the Idaho site of the western branch of Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne-West).

Various organizations have built more than 50 reactors at what is commonly called &quot;the Site&quot;, including the ones that gave the world its first usable amount of electricity from nuclear power and the power plant for the world&#x27;s first nuclear submarine. Although many are now decommissioned, these facilities are the largest concentration of reactors in the world.

It is on a complex in the high desert of eastern Idaho, between Arco to the west and Idaho Falls and Blackfoot to the east. Atomic City, Idaho is just south. The laboratory employs approximately 5,700 people.

==History==

What is now Idaho National Laboratory in southeastern Idaho began its life as a U.S. government artillery test range in the 1940s. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the U.S. military needed a safe location for performing maintenance on the Navy&#x27;s most powerful turreted guns. The guns were brought in via rail to near Pocatello, Idaho, to be re-sleeved, rifled and tested. As the Navy began to focus on post-World War II and Cold War threats, the types of projects worked on in the Idaho desert changed, too. Perhaps the most well-known was the building of the prototype reactor for the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;.

In 1949, the federal research facility was established as the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS). In 1975, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was divided into the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Idaho site was renamed the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) in 1974. After two decades as INEL, the name was changed again to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in 1997. Throughout its lifetime, there have been more than 50 one-of-a-kind nuclear reactors built by various organizations at the facility for testing; all but three are out of service.

On February 1, 2005, Battelle Energy Alliance took over operation of the lab from Bechtel, merged with Argonne National Laboratory-West, and the facility name was changed to &quot;Idaho National Laboratory&quot; (INL). At this time the site&#x27;s clean-up activities were moved to a separate contract, the Idaho Cleanup Project, which is currently managed by the Idaho Environmental Coalition, LLC. Research activities were consolidated in the newly named Idaho National Laboratory.

According to AP news reports in April 2018, a single barrel of &quot;radioactive sludge&quot; ruptured while being prepared for transport to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Southeast New Mexico for permanent storage. The 55-gallon barrel that ruptured is part of the badly-documented radioactive waste from the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver.

==Access==
In the Snake River Plain, most of INL is high desert with scrub vegetation and a number of facilities scattered throughout the area; the average elevation of the complex is above sea level. INL is accessible by U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 26, but most of the area (except Experimental Breeder Reactor I) is restricted to authorized personnel and requires appropriate security clearance. The tiny town of Atomic City is on the INL&#x27;s southern border, and the Craters of the Moon National Monument is to the southwest.

===Nuclear Energy Projects===
====Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP)====

One part of this program to develop improved nuclear power plants is the &quot;Next Generation Nuclear Plant&quot; or NGNP, which would be the demonstration of a new way to use nuclear energy for more than electricity. The heat generated from nuclear fission in the plant could provide process heat for hydrogen production and other industrial purposes, while also generating electricity. And the NGNP would use a high-temperature gas reactor, which would have redundant safety systems that rely on natural physical processes more than human or mechanical intervention.

INL worked with private industry to develop the NGNP between 2005 and 2011. It was commissioned to lead this effort by the United States Department of Energy as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Since 2011, the project has languished and funding for it ceased. The design for this reactor is currently owned by Framatome.

====Fuel Cycle Research &amp; Development (FCRD)====
The Fuel Cycle Research &amp; Development program aims to help expand nuclear energy&#x27;s benefits by addressing some of the issues inherent to the current life cycle of nuclear reactor fuel in the United States. These efforts strive to make nuclear energy&#x27;s expansion safe, secure, economic and sustainable.

Currently, the United States, like many other countries, employs an &quot;open-ended&quot; nuclear fuel cycle, whereby nuclear power plant fuel is used only once and then placed in a repository for indefinite storage. One of the primary FCRD goals is to research, develop and demonstrate ways to &quot;close&quot; the fuel cycle so fuel is reused or recycled rather than being shelved before all of its energy has been used. INL coordinates many of the FCRD&#x27;s national research efforts, including:
* Continuing critical fuel cycle research and development (R&amp;D) activities
* Pursuing the development of policy and regulatory framework to support fuel cycle closure
* Developing deployable technologies
* Establishing advanced modeling and simulation program elements
* Implementing a science-based R&amp;D program

====Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program====
The Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program supports national efforts to do the research and gather the information necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and prudent to apply for extensions beyond 60 years of operating life.

The Program aims to safely and economically extend the service lives of the more than 100 electricity-generating nuclear power plants in the United States. The program brings together technical information, performs important research and organizes data to be used in license-extension applications.

====Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF)====
INL&#x27;s Advanced Test Reactor is a research reactor located approximately from Idaho Falls, Idaho.

The Department of Energy named Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) a National Scientific User Facility in April 2007. This designation opened the facility to use by university-led scientific research groups and gives them free access to the ATR and other resources at INL and partner facilities. In addition to a rolling proposal solicitation with two closing dates each year, INL holds an annual &quot;Users Week&quot; and summer session to familiarize researchers with the user facility capabilities available to them.

====Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP)====
DOE&#x27;s Nuclear Energy University Programs provide funding for university research grants, fellowships, scholarships and infrastructure upgrades.

For example, in May 2010, the program awarded $38 million for 42 university-led R&amp;D projects at 23 United States universities in 17 states. In FY 2009, the program awarded about $44 million to 71 R&amp;D projects and more than $6 million in infrastructure grants to 30 U.S. universities and colleges in 23 states. INL&#x27;s Center for Advanced Energy Studies administers the program for DOE. CAES is a collaboration between INL and Idaho&#x27;s three public research universities: Idaho State University, Boise State University and University of Idaho.

====Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG)====
The Multiphysics Methods Group (MMG) is a program at Idaho National Laboratory (under the United States Department of Energy) begun in 2004. It uses applications based on the multiphysics and modeling framework MOOSE to simulate complex physical and chemical reactions inside nuclear reactors . The ultimate goal of the program is to use these simulation tools to enable more efficient use of nuclear fuel, resulting in lower electricity costs and less waste products.

The MMG focuses on problems within nuclear reactors related to its fuel and how heat is transferred inside the reactor. &quot;Fuel degradation&quot; refers to how uranium pellets and the rods they are encased in (several rods bundled together is what makes a &quot;fuel assembly&quot;) eventually wear out over time due to high heat and irradiation inside a reactor. The group states three main objectives: &quot;The mission of the MMG is to support the INL goal to advance the U.S. nuclear energy endeavor by:
* Furthering the state of computational nuclear engineering
* Developing a robust technical basis in multidimensional multiphysics analysis methods
* Developing the next generation of reactor simulation codes and tools&quot;

The work done by the group directly supports programs such as the Light Water Reactor Sustainability Program&#x27;s research into advanced nuclear fuels.

===National and Homeland Security ===
INL&#x27;s National and Homeland Security division focuses on two main areas: protecting critical infrastructures such as electricity transmission lines, utilities and wireless communications networks, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

====Control systems cybersecurity====
For nearly a decade, INL has been conducting vulnerability assessments and developing technology to increase infrastructure resilience. With a strong emphasis on industry collaboration and partnership, INL is enhancing electric grid reliability, control systems cybersecurity and physical security systems.

INL conducts advanced cyber training and oversees simulated competitive exercises for national and international customers. The lab supports cyber security and control systems programs for the departments of Homeland Security, Energy and Defense. INL staff members are frequently asked to provide guidance and leadership to standards organizations, regulatory agencies and national policy committees.

In January 2011, it was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the INL was allegedly responsible for some of the initial research behind the Stuxnet virus, which allegedly crippled Iran&#x27;s nuclear centrifuges. The INL, which teamed up with Siemens, conducted research on the P.C.S.-7 control system to identify its vulnerabilities. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, that information would later be used by the American and Israeli governments to create the Stuxnet virus.

The &quot;Times&quot; article was later disputed by other journalists, including Forbes blogger Jeffrey Carr, as being both sensational and lacking verifiable facts. In March 2011, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;&#x27;s magazine cover story on Stuxnet carried INL&#x27;s official response, stating, &quot;Idaho National Laboratory was not involved in the creation of the Stuxnet worm. In fact, our focus is to protect and defend control systems and critical infrastructures from cyber threats like Stuxnet and we are all well recognized for these efforts. We value the relationships that we have formed within the control systems industry and in no way would risk these partnerships by divulging confidential information.&quot;

====Nuclear nonproliferation====
Building on INL&#x27;s nuclear mission and legacy in reactor design and operations, the lab&#x27;s engineers are developing technology, shaping policy and leading initiatives to secure the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Under the direction of the National Nuclear Security Administration, INL and other national laboratory scientists are leading a global initiative to secure foreign stockpiles of fresh and spent highly enriched uranium and return it to secure storage for processing. Other engineers are working to convert U.S. research reactors and build new reactor fuels that replace highly enriched uranium with a safer, low-enriched uranium fuel. To protect against threats from the dispersal of nuclear and radiological devices, INL researchers also examine radiological materials to understand their origin and potential uses. Others have applied their knowledge to the development of detection technologies that scan and monitor containers for nuclear materials.

The laboratory&#x27;s expansive desert location, nuclear facilities and wide range of source materials provide an ideal training location for military responders, law enforcement and other civilian first responders. INL routinely supports these organizations by leading classroom training, conducting field exercises and assisting in technology assessments.

===Energy and environmental projects===
====Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity====
INL&#x27;s Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity gathers information from more than 4000 plug-in-hybrid vehicles. These vehicles, operated by a wide swath of companies, local and state governments, advocacy groups, and others are located all across the United States, Canada and Finland. Together, they have logged a combined 1.5 million miles worth of data that are analyzed by specialists at INL.

Dozens of other types of vehicles, like hydrogen-fueled and pure electric cars, are also tested at INL. This data will help evaluate the performance and other factors that will be critical to widespread adoption of plug-in or other alternative vehicles.

====Bioenergy====
INL researchers are partnering with farmers, agricultural equipment manufacturers and universities to optimize the logistics of an industrial-scale biofuel economy. Agricultural waste products—such as wheat straw; corncobs, stalks or leaves; or bioenergy crops such as switchgrass or miscanthus—could be used to create cellulosic biofuels. INL researchers are working to determine the most economic and sustainable ways to get biofuel raw materials from fields to biorefineries.

====Robotics====
INL&#x27;s robotics program researches, builds, tests and refines robots that, among other things, clean up dangerous wastes, measure radiation, scout drug-smuggling tunnels, aid search-and-rescue operations, and help protect the environment.

These robots roll, crawl, fly, and go under water, even in swarms that communicate with each other on the go to do their jobs.

====Biological Systems====
The Biological Systems department is housed in 15 laboratories with a total of at the INL Research Center in Idaho Falls. The department engages in a wide variety of biological studies, including studying bacteria and other microbes that live in extreme conditions such as the extremely high temperature pools of Yellowstone National Park. These types of organisms could boost the efficiency of biofuels production. Other studies related to uncommon microbes have potential in areas such as carbon dioxide sequestration and groundwater cleanup.

====Hybrid energy systems====
INL is pioneering the research and testing associated with hybrid energy systems that combine multiple energy sources for optimum carbon management and energy production. For example, a nuclear reactor could provide electricity when certain renewable resources are not available, while also providing a carbon-free source of heat and hydrogen that could be used, for example, to make liquid transportation fuels from coal.

====Nuclear waste processing====
In , construction of a new liquid waste processing facility, the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU), was nearing completion at INTEC on the INL site. It will process approximately 900,000 gallons of liquid nuclear waste using a steam reforming process to produce a granular product suitable for disposal. The facility is the first of its kind and based on a scaled prototype. The project is a part of the Department of Energy&#x27;s Idaho Cleanup Project aimed at removing waste and demolishing old nuclear facilities at the INL site.

====Safety and Tritium Applied Research====
In May 2022, CNBC reported the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) program has been set up to looking into the production and safety protocols for working with tritium, the fuel that many startups are working on to commercialize fusion power.

===Interdisciplinary projects===
The Instrumentation, Control and Intelligent Systems (ICIS) Distinctive Signature supports mission-related research and development in key capability areas: safeguards and control system security, sensor technologies, intelligent automation, human systems integration, and robotics and intelligent systems. These five key areas support the INL mission to &quot;ensure the nation&#x27;s energy security with safe, competitive, and sustainable energy systems and unique national and homeland security.&quot; Through its grand challenge in resilient control systems, ICIS research is providing a holistic approach to aspects of design that have often been bolt-on, including human systems, security and modeling of complex interdependency.

==Outreach==
===Scholarships and grants===
INL supports science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education in classrooms across the state. Each year, the lab invests nearly $500,000 in Idaho teachers and students. Funding goes toward scholarship programs for high school graduates, technical college students and teachers who want to integrate more hands-on science activities into their lessons. INL also provides thousands of dollars worth of classroom grants to teachers seeking to upgrade their science equipment or lab infrastructure.

===Internships===
The lab hires more than 300 interns each summer to work alongside laboratory employees. INL is listed by Vault, the online job resource site, as one of the best places in the U.S. to get an internship Internships are offered to high school, undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students in applicable fields including science, engineering, math, chemistry, business, communication and other fields.

===Small business outreach===
In addition to subcontracting more than $100 million worth of work from Idaho&#x27;s small businesses, INL technologies are often licensed to new or existing companies for commercialization. In the past 10 years, INL has negotiated roughly 500 technology licenses. And INL technology has spawned more than 40 start-up companies since 1995.

Small businesses that contract with the lab can participate in a Department of Energy program designed to enhance their capabilities. INL has worked with a variety of small businesses in this mentoring capacity, including International Management Solutions and Portage Environmental.

==Facilities==
===Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) complex===
INL&#x27;s Advanced Test Reactor is much smaller than the more common electricity-producing reactors—the reactor vessel measures across and high, with the core a mere tall and across, and it does not generate electricity. As a special feature, it allows scientists to simultaneously test materials in multiple unique experimental environments. Research scientists can place experiments in one of the more than 70 test positions in the reactor. Each can generate unique experimental conditions.

Some have called the reactor a &quot;virtual time machine&quot;, for its ability to demonstrate the effects of several years of radiation on materials in a fraction of the time.

The ATR allows scientists to place a variety of materials in an environment with specified intensities of radiation, temperature, and pressure. Specimens are then removed to examine how the time in the reactor affected the materials. The U.S. Navy is the facility&#x27;s primary user, but the ATR also produces medical isotopes that can help treat cancer patients and industrial isotopes that can be used for radiography to x-ray welds on items such as skyscrapers, bridges and ship holds.

Many ATR experiments focus on materials that could make the next generation of nuclear reactors even safer and longer lasting.

===Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC)===
====Hot Fuel Examination Facility====

The Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) gives INL researchers and other scientists the ability to examine and test highly radioactive irradiated reactor fuel and other materials.

HFEF provides 15 workstations known as hot cells. For windows, each cell has leaded glass panes layered thick and separated by thin layers of oil. Remote manipulators allow users to maneuver items inside the hot cell using robotic arms. Special filtered exhaust systems keep indoor and outdoor air safe. At these stations, scientists and technicians can better determine the performance of irradiated fuels and materials. Scientists can also characterize materials destined for long-term storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico.

====Space and Security Power Systems Facility====
The New Horizons mission to Pluto, which launched in 2006, is powered by a device fueled at the INL Space and Security Power Systems Facility. The Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) uses nonfissionable nonweapons-grade plutonium to produce heat and electricity for deep space missions such as this one.

Using the RTG on the New Horizons mission is a more practical power source for the satellite than solar panels because the satellite will travel to such a great distance that energy from the sun would provide insufficient power for the craft. Work on the project started in late 2004 and ended with the January 2006 successful rocket launch. The team implemented the fueling, testing and delivery of the RTG for the Pluto New Horizons mission and for the next Mars rover.

====Fuel Conditioning Facility====
INL&#x27;s Fuel Conditioning Facility uses electrolysis to separate certain components from used nuclear fuel rods. Unlike traditional aqueous reprocessing techniques, which dissolve the fuel rods in acid, &quot;pyroprocessing&quot; melts the rods and uses electricity to separate components such as uranium and sodium out of the mix. INL is using this technique to remove the sodium metal from Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) fuel rods so they can be safely stored in a national repository.

===== Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) =====
The Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) is a reactor designed specifically to test new reactor fuels and materials.

==== Radiochemistry Lab ====
The Radiochemistry Lab is a facility that includes one radiation instrumentation lab, two actinide chemistry labs, and other labs for both radiological and non-radiological research.

===Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex (CITRC)===
INL&#x27;s Critical Infrastructure Test Range Complex (CITRC), operated by INL, is a utility-scale electric power grid test bed. The electric grid is an operational, commercially fed system that provides power to all of INL&#x27;s key research facilities on its sprawling, desert site; and includes: seven substations, a 24/7 staffed dispatch and control center, 61 miles of 138 kV transmission lines, and multiple distribution circuits at 15 kV, 25 kV and 35 kV. Sections of the grid can be isolated and reconfigured for integrated testing and demonstration of state of the art power systems, components and smart grid technologies.

In addition, INL owns and operates a communications network designed to research and test cellular, mobile and emerging Internet communication protocols and technology, with both fixed and mobile 3-G platforms that allow testing and demonstration within a range of experimental frequencies in a low-background environment.

===Research and Education Campus in Idaho Falls===
====Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES)====
This is a partnership between INL and Idaho&#x27;s three public research universities—Idaho State University, University of Idaho, and Boise State University. Its researchers, who have access to each partner institution&#x27;s equipment and infrastructure, have competed for and won millions of dollars in national funding for their projects. The center&#x27;s laboratories are equipped with research instruments and tools, including a Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) and a Computer Assisted Virtual Environment (CAVE).

====Matched Index of Refraction (MIR) facility====
The Matched Index of Refraction facility is the largest such facility in the world. Using light mineral oil, the facility allows researchers to use fused quartz models built to scale to study the flow of liquids inside and around objects with complicated geometries, such as the core of a nuclear reactor. The facility is basically a giant loop through which the mostly transparent oil is pumped at variable speeds. Special lasers perform &quot;Doppler velocimetry&quot;, that produces a three-dimensional image allowing inspection of an object&#x27;s flow properties. Observers can also watch the flow themselves through the polycarbonate viewing panes near the laser equipment.

====Geocentrifuge====

INL&#x27;s geocentrifuge helps researchers, among other efforts, improve models of how liquids and contaminants move through engineered caps and barriers used in underground waste disposal facilities.

The INL centrifuge is one of fewer than 25 geocentrifuges larger than two meters (about 6 feet) in the United States.
The centrifuge, located next to the INL Research Center in Idaho Falls, can be operated remotely by computer and is capable of applying 130 times the force of earth&#x27;s gravity on a sample.

Many of the experiments that use the geocentrifuge require it to run for hundreds of hours in order to correctly simulate several years&#x27; worth of gravitational effects. The payload is monitored by an onboard computer and can be relayed to a remote monitoring station outside the centrifuge&#x27;s chamber where technicians can observe developments.

==Earlier projects==
===Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I)===
In the early afternoon of December 20, 1951, Argonne National Laboratory scientist Walter Zinn and a small crew of assistants witnessed a row of four light bulbs light up in a nondescript brick building in the eastern Idaho desert. Electricity from a generator connected to Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) flowed through them. This was the first time that a usable amount of electrical power had ever been generated from nuclear fission.

Only days afterward, the reactor produced all the electricity needed for the entire EBR complex. One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity—this is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil.

More central to EBR-I&#x27;s purpose than just generating electricity, however, was its role in proving that a reactor could create more nuclear fuel as a by-product than it consumed during operation. In 1953, tests verified that this was the case. The site of this event is memorialized as a Registered National Historic Landmark, open to the public every day Memorial Day through Labor Day.

===Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II)===
From 1969 to 1994, Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s EBR-II produced nearly half of the electricity needed for test site operations.

In 1964, Experimental Breeder Reactor II and the nearby Fuel Conditioning Facility proved the concept of fuel recycling and passive safety characteristics. So-called &quot;passive&quot; safety includes systems that rely on natural physics laws such as gravity rather than systems that require mechanical or human intervention.

In a landmark test on April 3, 1986, such systems in EBR-II demonstrated that nuclear power plants could be designed to be inherently safe from severe accidents.

De-commissioning of EBR-II began in October 1994 with the removal of the 637 fuel assemblies.

===Loss of Fluid Test (LOFT) facility===

The world&#x27;s first Loss-of-Fluid-Test reactor started up at INL on March 12, 1976. It repeatedly simulated loss-of-coolant accidents that could potentially occur in commercial nuclear power plants. Many safety designs for reactors around the world are based on these tests. LOFT experiments helped accident recovery efforts after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.

===Test Area North===
In 1949, an area of the fringe of the NRTS property named &quot;Test Area North&quot;, or TAN, was developed by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission to support the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program&#x27;s attempt to develop a nuclear-powered aircraft. The program&#x27;s Heat Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE) were conducted here in 1955 by contractor General Electric, and were a series of tests to develop a system of transferring reactor-heated air to a modified General Electric J47 jet engine. The planned aircraft, the Convair X-6, was to be test flown at TAN, and a large hangar with radiation shielding was built on the site. The program was cancelled, however, before the accompanying runway could be built.

===Naval Reactors Facility (NRF)===

In the early 1950s, the very first full-scale prototype nuclear plant for shipboard use, called S1W Prototype, was constructed to test the feasibility of using nuclear power aboard submarines. It was the predecessor to a similar nuclear plant of S2W design installed in the first nuclear-powered ship, the submarine . Later, two more prototype plant facilities, A1W and S5G, were built at this location called the Naval Reactors Facility (NRF for short). There is also an Expended Core Facility (ECF for short) also at NRF and administrative buildings/facilities. NRF&#x27;s chemistry lab was located at the S1W prototype. By now, the prototype plants for shipboard use development have been shut down. Only the Expended Core Facility / Dry Storage Area is in use.

===Materials Test Reactor (MTR)===

When the nuclear industry was just getting started in the early 1950s, it was difficult to predict exactly how different kinds of metals and other materials would be affected by being used in a reactor for prolonged periods of time. MTR was a research reactor jointly designed by Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories that operated until 1970 and provided important data, helping researchers make nuclear power reactors safer and longer lasting.

===BORAX experiments===
The Boiling Water Reactors (BORAX) experiments were five reactors built between 1953 and 1964 by Argonne National Laboratory. They proved that the boiling water concept was a feasible design for an electricity-producing nuclear reactor. The BORAX III reactor was also the first in the world to power a community (Arco, Idaho) on July 17, 1955.

===Other sites===
The Idaho Chemical Processing Plant chemically processed material from used reactor cores to recover reusable nuclear material. It is now called the .

The Materials Test Area tested materials&#x27; exposure to reactor conditions. The Materials Test Area is part of the Advanced Test Reactor Complex.

The Information Operations and Research Center and the Shelley-New Sweden Park and Ride lot is one of fourteen Federal properties listed for disposal by the Public Buildings Reform Board in their 2019 recommendations.

== Incidents and accidents ==

===1961 fatal incident===

On January 3, 1961, the only fatal nuclear reactor incident in the U.S. occurred at the NRTS. An experimental reactor called SL-1 (Stationary Low-Power Plant Number 1) was destroyed when a control rod was pulled too far out of the reactor, leading to a near-instantaneous prompt-critical power excursion and steam explosion. The reactor vessel jumped up . The concussion and blast killed all three military enlisted personnel working on the reactor. Due to the extensive radioactive isotope contamination, all three were buried in lead coffins. The events are the subject of two books, one published in 2003, &quot;Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America&#x27;s First Nuclear Accident&quot;, and another, &quot;Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History&quot;, published in 2009.

===&quot;Plutonium-related&quot; container leak===

On the afternoon of November 8, 2011, in the Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR), a container leaked &quot;plutonium-related&quot; materials, when it was opened by one of the workers. All 17 workers at the incident were immediately taken to have testing done by the Idaho Cleanup Project in the form of whole-body counts (scanning the body for any internal radiation exposure) and were required to submit urine and fecal samples to further test for internal radioisotopes. Six of them proved to be exposed to &quot;low-level-radiation&quot;, two of them fairly extensively. All workers were kept under close observation afterwards with repeated whole-body counts and urine and fecal sampling. The Idaho National Laboratory insisted that no radioactivity leaked outside the facility.

===2018 radioactive waste &quot;drum breach&quot; accidents===

In April 2018, four canisters of depleted uranium sludge suddenly overpressurized and ejected their lids at a US Department of Energy facility at Idaho National Laboratory. The waste had originated from the now-decommissioned Rocky Flats weapons plutonium production plant. In 2018, anthropologist Vincent Ialenti conducted fieldwork in Idaho exploring the accident&#x27;s root causes. Comparing the accident to a 2014 drum breach accident at the WIPP nuclear waste repository in New Mexico, Ialenti attributed Idaho&#x27;s drum breaches to &quot;systemic incentives to speed up waste-cleanup projects beyond their organizational capacity, without commensurately expanding their safety or oversight mechanisms.&quot;

===2023 data breach===

In November 2023 hacktivist group SiegedSec breached the Oracle HR system of the Idaho National Laboratory and posted information of 45,047 former and current employees on their Telegram channel. The group demanded the laboratory research the creation of female cat-human hybrids, &quot;catgirls&quot;, in exchange for the removal of the post containing the stolen data.

<text>Xavier Ignacio Cortada (born September 13, 1964) is an American eco artist, public artist, and former lawyer. As a National Science Foundation Antarctic Artists and Writers Program fellow and a New York Foundation for the Arts-sponsored Artist, Cortada created works at the North Pole and South Pole to generate awareness about global climate change.

He has worked with groups globally to produce collaborative art projects, including peace murals in Cyprus and Northern Ireland, child welfare murals in Bolivia and Panama, AIDS murals in Switzerland and South Africa, juvenile justice murals and projects in Miami and Philadelphia, and eco-art projects in Taiwan, Hawaii, and the Netherlands.

Cortada has also been commissioned to create art for CERN, the White House, the World Bank, Florida Botanical Gardens, Miami City Hall, Miami-Dade County Hall, the Florida Turnpike, the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science, Museum of Florida History, Port Everglades, the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum, and at ten Miami-Dade Housing Authority sites.

==Early life and education==
Cortada was born in Albany, New York, on September 13, 1964, and raised in Miami. His parents are both Cuban immigrants. He attended the University of Miami, where he received a Bachelor of Arts from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1986, a Master of Public Administration from Miami Herbert Business School in 1991, and a Juris Doctor from the University of Miami School of Law in 1991. At the University of Miami, he was inducted into the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest honor bestowed by the university.

==Career ==
Early in his childhood, Cortada was fascinated with mangroves during family trips to Bear Cut Key in Key Biscayne, Florida. The plant functions as a central theme to many of his socially engaged artworks and public art projects.

Between 1997 and 2007, Cortada received support from Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Council&#x27;s Community Grants to implement art projects with Miami-Dade Art in Public Places, the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami School of Law, Centro Campesino, Miami Lighthouse for the Blind, Citizens for a Better South Florida, Hands-on Miami, and the Office of the Public Defender.

In 1998, the State of Florida Division of Cultural Affairs’ Artist Residency grant helped him implement the &quot;Reach for the Future&quot; Miami-Dade Art in Public Places residency at Palm Springs Middle School in Hialeah, Florida in 1998. 

In 1999, with a Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Council/Art Center South Florida&#x27;s New Forms Artists Grant, he implemented the &quot;WebStudio Project,&quot; an Internet-based collaborative art project using two webcams and a live chat room. 

Cortada served as artistic director of various efforts sponsored by Miami-Dade Art in Public Places, including Master Peace, a school-based art project in Miami-Dade County Public Schools, and the Public Art Transforming Housing in Miami-Dade Housing Agency (PATH).

Cortada also volunteered with U.S. embassies in four continents and implemented numerous international mural projects through grant awards and artist residencies. He did so with the support of various entities, including the U.S. State Department and USAID.

In February 2000, invited by the Holy See, Cortada visited St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica to participate in the Jubilee Day for Artists and meet Pope John Paul II. That summer, he was invited to create a mural for the White House Conference on Minority Homeownership. The president was one of the participants of his collaborative mural.

In 2007, as a National Science Foundation Antarctic Artist and Writer&#x27;s Program Fellow, the artist used the moving ice sheet beneath the South Pole as an instrument to mark time; the art piece will be completed in 150,000 years. In 2008, he planted a green flag at the North Pole to reclaim it for nature and launch an eco-art reforestation effort.

===Artistic collaborations===
* At CERN, Cortada worked with a physicist to develop a site-specific art installation capturing the five search strategies, which the CMS experiment has used to discover a new Higgs-like particle. The five giant banners hang at the location (100m below the ground) where the particle was discovered.
* He has worked with a population geneticist on a project exploring ancestral journeys out of Africa 60,000 years ago, with a molecular biologist to synthesize an actual DNA strand made from a sequence randomly generated by participants visiting his museum exhibit, and with botanists in participatory eco-art projects to reforest mangroves, native trees and wildflowers.
* Cortada is working with scientists at Hubbard Brook Long Term Ecological Research Network on a water cycle visualization project driven by real-time data collected at a watershed in the White Mountains in New Hampshire.
* At Florida International University, Cortada collaborated with Florida Coastal Everglades LTER scientists in using the diatoms they study to address sea level rise and environmental degradation. From 2011 to 2018, Cortada based his engaged art-science practice at Florida International University. where he served as Artist-in-Residence at FIU School of Environment, Arts and Society, the FIU College of Arts, Sciences &amp; Education, and the FIU College of Communication, Architecture and The Arts.
*He has worked with groups globally on collaborative art projects, including peace murals in Cyprus and Northern Ireland, child welfare murals in Bolivia and Panama, AIDS murals in Switzerland and South Africa, juvenile justice murals and projects in Miami and Philadelphia, and eco-art projects in Taiwan, Hawaii, the Netherlands, and Latvia.

Cortada has been commissioned to create art for CERN, the White House, the World Bank, the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida Governor&#x27;s Mansion, Florida Botanical Gardens, Miami City Hall, Miami-Dade County Hall, the Florida Turnpike, Miami-Dade Housing Authority, the Frost Science Museum, Museum of Florida History, and the Frost Art Museum.

His work is in the permanent collections of the Perez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), the NSU Museum of Art in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, the Whatcom Museum, the Patricia and Philip Frost Art Museum and the MDC Museum of Art + Design.

General Mills, Nike, Heineken, and Hershey&#x27;s have commissioned his art. Publishers, including McDougal and Random House, have featured it in school textbooks and publications. His work has also been featured in National Geographic TV and the Discovery Channel.

Cortada&#x27;s studio is located at Pinecrest Gardens, where he serves as artist-in-residence, implements his participatory art projects and runs the Hibiscus Gallery. He lso serves on boards of various national, regional and local groups, including University of Miami Alumni Association, South Arts, and the Miami-Dade Cultural Affairs Council.

<text>Mahāvaṃsa (Sinhala: මහාවංශ (Mahāvansha), Pali: &quot;මහාවංස (Mahāvaṃsa)&quot;) is the meticulously kept historical chronicle of Sri Lanka until the period of Mahasena of Anuradhapura. It was written in the style of an epic poem written in the Pali language. It relates the history of Sri Lanka from its legendary beginnings up to the reign of Mahasena of Anuradhapura covering the period between the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India in 543 BCE to his reign and later updated by different writers. It was first composed by a Buddhist monk named Mahanama at the Mahavihara temple in Anuradhapura in the 5th or 6th-century CE.

The Mahavamsa first came to the attention of Western researchers around 1809 CE, when Sir Alexander Johnston, Chief Justice of the British Ceylon, sent manuscripts of it and other Sri Lankan chronicles (written in mainly Sinhala language being the main language of Sri Lanka) to Europe for translation and publication. Eugène Burnouf produced a Romanized transliteration and translation into Latin in 1826, but these garnered relatively little attention. Working from Johnston&#x27;s manuscripts, Edward Upham published an English translation in 1833, but it was marked by several errors in translation and interpretation, among them suggesting that the Buddha was born in Sri Lanka and built a monastery atop Adam&#x27;s Peak. The first printed edition and widely read English translation was published in 1837 by George Turnour, a historian and officer of the Ceylon Civil Service who translated 38 chapters. Mudaliyar L. C. Wijesinghe completed the remaining 62 chapters and reviewed Turnour&#x27;s work, publishing in 1889. A German translation of &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; was completed by Wilhelm Geiger in 1912. This was then translated into English by Mabel Haynes Bode, and revised by Geiger.

In 2023, the Mahavamsa was listed an item of documentary heritage on the UNESCO’s Memory of the World International Register.

== Compilation ==
The Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of the island&#x27;s history starting from the 3rd century BCE. These annals were then combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century while King Dhatusena was ruling the Anuradhapura Kingdom. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the &quot;Atthakatha&quot; (sometimes &quot;Sinhalaatthakatha&quot;), which were commentaries written in Sinhala. An earlier document known as the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; (4th century CE) &quot;Chronicles of the Island&quot; is much simpler and contains less information than the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; and was probably compiled using the &quot;Atthakatha&quot; on the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; as well. 

Authorship of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; is attributed to an otherwise unknown monk called Mahānāma by the &quot;Mahavamsa-tika&quot;. Mahānāma is described as residing in a monastery belonging to general Dighasanda and affiliated with the Mahavihara, but no other reliable biographical information is known. Mahānāma introduces the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; with a passage that claims that he intends to correct repetitions and shortcomings that afflicted the chronicle compiled by the ancients- this may refer either to the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; or to the Sinhala Atthakatha.

== Contents ==
The contents of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; can be broadly divided into four categories:

* The Buddha&#x27;s Visits to Sri Lanka: This material recounts three legendary visits by the Buddha to the island of Sri Lanka. These stories describe the Buddha subduing or driving away the Yakkhas (Yakshas) and Nagas that were inhabiting the island and delivering a prophecy that Sri Lanka will become an important Buddhist center. These visits are not mentioned in the Pali Canon or other early sources.
* Chronicles of Kings of Sri Lanka: This material consists of genealogies and lineages of Sri Lankan kings, sometimes with stories about their succession or notable incidents in their reigns. This material may have been derived from earlier royal chronicles and king lists that were recorded orally in vernacular languages, and are a significant source of material about the history of Sri Lanka and nearby Indian kingdoms.
* History of the Buddhist Sangha: This section of the Mahavamsa deals with the mission sent by Emperor Ashoka to Sri Lanka, the transplantation of the bodhi tree, and the founding of the Mahavihara. It includes the names of prominent monks and nuns in the early Sri Lankan sangha. It also includes accounts of the early Buddhist councils and the first recording of the Pali canon in writing. This is a significant source of material about the development of the early Buddhist community and includes the names of missionaries dispatched to various regions of South and Southeast Asia, some of which have been confirmed by inscriptions and other archaeological evidence.
* Chronicles of Sri Lanka: This material begins with the immigration of Prince Vijaya from India with his retinue and continues until the reign of King Mahasena, recounting wars, succession disputes, the building of stupas and reliquaries, and other notable incidents. An extensive chronicle of the war between the Sinhala King Dutthagamani and Tamil invader, and later king, Elara (861 verses in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; compared with 13 verses in the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;) may represent the incorporation of a popular epic from the vernacular tradition.

While much of the contents of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; is derived from expansions of the material found in the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot;, several passages specifically dealing with the Abhayagiri vihara are omitted, suggesting that the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; was more specifically associated with the Mahavihara.

==Further compilations ==
A companion volume, the &quot;Culavamsa&quot; &quot;Lesser Chronicle&quot;, compiled by Sinhala monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the British takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The &quot;Culavamsa&quot; was compiled by several authors of different periods.

The combined work sometimes referred to collectively as the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world&#x27;s longest unbroken historical accounts. It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the Nāga and Yakkha peoples, indigenous inhabitants of Lanka before the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga. As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the Indian subcontinent. It is very important in dating the consecration of the Maurya Emperor Ashoka, which is related to the synchronicity with the Seleucid Empire and Alexander the Great. Indian excavations in Sanchi and other locations, confirm the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; account of the empire of Ashoka. The accounts given in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; are also amply supported by the numerous stone inscriptions, mostly in Sinhala, found in Sri Lanka. K. Indrapala has also upheld the historical value of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;. If not for the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the story behind the large stupas in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, such as Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavanaramaya, Abhayagiri vihāra and other works of ancient engineering would never have been known.

== Historical and literary significance ==
Historiographical sources are rare in much of South Asia. As a result of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, comparatively more is known about the history of the island of Ceylon and neighboring regions than that of most of the subcontinent. Its contents have aided in the identification and corroboration of archaeological sites and inscriptions associated with early Buddhism, the empire of Ashoka, and even the Tamil kingdoms of southern India.

The &quot;Mahamvasa&quot; covers the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, beginning with the time of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism. It also briefly recounts the history of Buddhism in India, from the date of the Buddha&#x27;s death to the 3rd Buddhist council where the Dharma was reviewed. Every chapter of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; ends by stating that it is written for the &quot;serene joy of the pious&quot;. From the emphasis of its point-of-view, and being compiled to record the good deeds of the kings who were patrons of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, it has been said to support Sinhalese nationalism.

Besides being an important historical source, the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; is the most important epic poem in the Pali language. Its stories of battles and invasions, court intrigue, and great constructions of stupas and water reservoirs, written in elegant verse suitable for memorization, caught the imagination of the Buddhist world of the time. Unlike many texts written in antiquity, it also discusses various aspects of the lives of ordinary people, and how they joined the King&#x27;s army or farmed. Thus the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; was taken along the Silk Road to many Buddhist lands. Parts of it were translated, retold, and absorbed into other languages. An extended version of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, which gives many more details, has also been found in Southeast Asia. The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; gave rise to many other Pali chronicles, making Sri Lanka of that period probably the world&#x27;s leading center in Pali literature.

==Political significance==
The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; has, especially in modern Sri Lanka, acquired significance as a document with a political message. The Sinhalese majority often use Mahavamsa as proof of their claim that Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese nation since historical time.

The British historian Jane Russell has recounted how a process of &quot;&quot;Mahavamsa&quot; bashing&quot; began in the 1930s, from within the Tamil Nationalist movement. The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, being a history of the Sinhala Buddhists, presented itself to the Tamil Nationalists and the Sinhala Nationalists as the hegemonic epic of the Sinhala people. This view was attacked by G. G. Ponnambalam, a representative of the Nationalist Tamils in the 1930s. He claimed that most of the Sinhala kings, including Vijaya, Kasyapa, and Parakramabahu, were Tamils. Ponnambalam&#x27;s 1939 speech in Nawalapitiya, attacking the claim that Sri Lanka is a Sinhalese, Buddhist nation was seen as an act against the notion of creating a Sinhalese-Buddhist only nation. The Sinhala majority responded with a mob riot, which engulfed Nawalapitiya, Passara, Maskeliya, and even in Tamil Jaffna.

==Historical accuracy==
Early Western scholars like Otto Franke dismissed the possibility that the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; contained reliable historical content, but subsequent evidence from inscriptions and archaeological finds have confirmed that there is a factual basis for many of the stories recorded in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, including Ashoka&#x27;s missionary work and the kings associated with founding various monasteries and stupas. The contents of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; beginning from the King Devanampiyatissa is considered mostly historically, apart from some bias by the writers. 

Wilhelm Geiger was one of the first Western scholars to suggest that it was possible to separate useful historical information from the mythic and poetic elaborations of the chronicle. While other scholars had assumed that the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; had been assembled from borrowed material from Indian Pali sources, Geiger hypothesized that the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; had been based on earlier Sinhala sources that originated on the island of Ceylon. While Geiger did not believe that the details provided with every story and name were reliable, he broke from earlier scholars in believing that the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; faithfully reflected an earlier tradition that had preserved the names and deeds of various royal and religious leaders, rather than being a pure work of heroic literary fiction. He regarded the early chapters of the &quot;Culavamsa&quot; as the most accurate, with the early chapters of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; being too remote historically and the later sections of the &quot;Culavamsa&quot; marked by excessive elaboration.

Geiger&#x27;s Sinhala student G. C. Mendis was more openly skeptical about certain portions of the text, specifically citing the story of the Sinhala ancestor Vijaya as being too remote historically from its source and too similar to an epic poem or other literary creation to be seriously regarded as history. The date of Vijaya&#x27;s arrival is thought to have been artificially fixed to coincide with the date for the death of Gautama Buddha around 543 BCE. The Chinese pilgrims Fa Hsien and Hsuan Tsang both recorded myths of the origins of the Sinhala people in their travels that varied significantly from the versions recorded in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;- in one version, the Sinhala are descended from naga or nature spirits who traded with Indian merchants, and in another, the Sinhala progenitor is a prince exiled for patricide who then slays a wealthy merchant and adopts his 500 children.

The story of the Buddha&#x27;s three visits to Sri Lanka is not recorded in any source outside of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; tradition. Moreover, the genealogy of the Buddha recorded in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; describes him as being the product of four cross cousin marriages. Cross-cousin marriage is associated historically with the Dravidian people of southern India- both Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhala practiced cross-cousin marriage historically- but the exogamous marriage was the norm in the regions of northern India associated with the life of the Buddha. No mention of cross-cousin marriage is found in earlier Buddhist sources, and scholars suspect that this genealogy was created to fit the Buddha into conventional Sri Lankan social structures for noble families.

The historical accuracy of Mahinda converting the Sri Lankan king to Buddhism is also debated. Hermann Oldenberg, a German scholar of Indology who has published studies on the Buddha and translated many Pali texts, considers this story a &quot;pure invention&quot;. V. A. Smith (Author of &quot;Ashoka&quot; and &quot;Early History of India&quot;) also refers to this story as &quot;a tissue of absurdities&quot;. V. A. Smith and Professor Hermann came to this conclusion due to Ashoka not mentioning the handing over of his son, Mahinda, to the temple to become a Buddhist missionary and Mahinda&#x27;s role in converting the Sri Lankan king to Buddhism, in his 13th-year Rock Edicts, particularly Rock-Edict XIII. Sources outside of Sri Lanka and the Mahavamsa tradition do not mention Mahinda as Ashoka&#x27;s son. There is also an inconsistency with the year in which Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to Sri Lanka. According to the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the missionaries arrived in 255 BCE, but according to Edict 13, it was five years earlier in 260 BCE.

== Related works ==
The &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; is believed to have originated from an earlier chronicle known as the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; (4th century CE; ). The &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; is much simpler and contains less information than the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; and probably served as the nucleus of an oral tradition that was eventually incorporated into the written &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;. The &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; is believed to have been the first Pali text composed entirely in Ceylon.

A subsequent work sometimes known as &quot;Culavamsa&quot; extends the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; to cover the period from the reign of Mahasena of Anuradhapura (277–304 CE) until 1815, when the entire island was surrendered to the British throne. The &quot;Culavamsa&quot; contains three sections composed by five different authors (one anonymous) belonging to successive historical periods.

In 1935, Buddhist monk Yagirala Pannananda published &quot;Mahavamsa Part III&quot;, a Sinhala language continuation of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; that covers the period from the end of the &quot;Culavamsa&quot; up until 1935. While not authorized or supported by any government or religious organization, this continuation of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; was later recognized by the government of the Sri Lankan Prime Minister J. R. Jayawardene.

A commentary on the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, known as the &quot;Mahavamsa-tika&quot;, is believed to have been composed before the first additions composing the &quot;Culavamsa&quot; were written, likely sometime between 1000 CE and 1250 CE. This commentary provides explanations of ambiguous Pali terms used in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, and in some cases adds additional details or clarifies differences between different versions of the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;. Unlike the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; itself, which is composed almost entirely of material associated with the Mahavihara, the &quot;Mahavamsa-tika&quot; makes several references to commentaries and alternate versions of the chronicle associated with the Abhayagiri vihara tradition.

===Extended===
In Southeast Asia, a Pali work referred to as the &quot;Extended &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;&quot; includes not only the text of the Sri Lankan &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, but also elements of the &quot;Thupavamsa&quot;, &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot;, &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; commentaries, and quotations from various jatakas. It is sometimes referred to in academic literature as the &quot;Kampuchean Mahavamsa&quot; or &quot;Khmer Mahavamsa&quot; because it is distinguished by being recorded in the Khmer script. Its composition is attributed to an otherwise unknown monk called Moggallana and its exact period of composition and origin are unknown. The origin of this version is believed to be Burma or Thailand.

<text>Operation HIGHJUMP, officially titled The United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program, 1946–1947, (also called Task Force 68), was a United States Navy (USN) operation to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV. The operation was organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, Jr., USN, Officer in Charge, Task Force 68, and led by Rear Admiral Ethan Erik Larson, USN, Commanding Officer, Task Force 68. Operation HIGHJUMP commenced 26 August 1946 and ended in late February 1947. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 70 ships, and 33 aircraft.

HIGHJUMP&#x27;s objectives, according to the U.S. Navy report of the operation, were:

# Training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions;
# Consolidating and extending the United States&#x27; sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent (publicly denied as a goal before the expedition ended);
# Determining the feasibility of establishing, maintaining, and utilizing bases in the Antarctic and investigating possible base sites;
# Developing techniques for establishing, maintaining, and utilizing air bases on ice, with particular attention to later applicability of such techniques to operations in interior Greenland, where conditions are comparable to those in the Antarctic;
# Amplifying existing stores of knowledge of electromagnetic, geological, geographic, hydrographic, and meteorological propagation conditions in the area;
# Supplementary objectives of the Nanook expedition (a smaller equivalent conducted off eastern Greenland).

==Timeline==

The Western Group of ships reached the Marquesas Islands on December 12, 1946, whereupon the USS &quot;Henderson&quot; and USS &quot;Cacapon&quot; set up weather monitoring stations. By December 24, the USS &quot;Currituck&quot; had begun launching aircraft on reconnaissance missions.

The Eastern Group of ships reached Peter I Island in late December 1946.

On December 30, 1946, the Martin PBM-5 &quot;George 1&quot; crashed on Thurston Island killing Ensign Maxwell A. Lopez, ARM1 Wendell K. Henderson, and ARM1 Frederick W. Williams. The other six crew members were rescued 13 days later. These and Vance N. Woodall, who died on January 21, 1947, were the only fatalities during Operation HIGHJUMP.

On January 1, 1947, Lieutenant Commander Thompson and Chief Petty Officer John Marion Dickison utilized &quot;Jack Browne&quot; masks and DESCO oxygen rebreathers to log the first dive by Americans under the Antarctic. Paul Siple was the senior U.S. War Department representative on the expedition. Siple was the same Eagle Scout who accompanied Byrd on the previous Byrd Antarctic expeditions.

The Central Group of ships reached the Bay of Whales on January 15, 1947, where they began construction of Little America IV.

Naval ships and personnel were withdrawn back to the United States in late February 1947, and the expedition was terminated due to the early approach of winter and worsening weather conditions.

Byrd discussed the lessons learned from the operation in an interview with Lee van Atta of International News Service held aboard the expedition&#x27;s command ship, the USS &quot;Mount Olympus&quot;. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947, edition of the Chilean newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot; and read in part as follows:

Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.

After the operation ended, a follow-up Operation Windmill returned to the area in order to provide ground-truthing to the aerial photography of HIGHJUMP from 1947 to 1948. Finn Ronne also financed a private operation to the same territory until 1948.

As with other U.S. Antarctic expeditions, interested persons were allowed to send letters with enclosed envelopes to the base, where commemorative cachets were added to their enclosures, which were then returned to the senders. These souvenir philatelic covers are readily available at low cost. It is estimated that at least 150,000 such envelopes were produced, though their final number may be considerably higher.

===Fatalities===
On December 30, 1946, aviation radiomen Wendell K. Henderson, Fredrick W. Williams, and Ensign Maxwell A. Lopez were killed when their plane crashed (named &quot;George 1&quot;a Martin PBM Mariner) during a blizzard. The surviving six crew members were rescued 13 days later, including aviation radioman James H. Robbins and co-pilot William Kearns. A plaque honoring the three killed crewmen was later erected at the McMurdo Station research base, and Mount Lopez on Thurston Island was named in honor of killed naval aviator Maxwell A. Lopez. In December 2004, an attempt was made to locate the remains of the plane. In 2007 a group called the George One Recovery Team was unsuccessful in trying to get direct military involvement and raise extensive funds from the United States Congress to try to find the bodies of the three men killed in the crash.

On January 21, 1947, Vance N. Woodall died during a &quot;ship unloading accident&quot;. In a crew profile, deckman Edward Beardsley described his worst memory as &quot;when Seaman Vance Woodall died on the Ross Ice Shelf under a piece of roller equipment designed to &#x27;pave&#x27; the ice to build an airstrip.&quot;

==In media==
The documentary about the expedition &quot;The Secret Land&quot; was filmed entirely by military photographers (both USN and US Army) and narrated by actors Robert Taylor, Robert Montgomery, and Van Heflin. It features Chief of Naval Operations Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz in a scene where he is discussing Operation HIGHJUMP with admirals Byrd and Cruzen. The film re-enacted scenes of critical events, such as shipboard damage control and Admiral Byrd throwing items out of an airplane to lighten it to avoid crashing into a mountain. It won the 1948 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film.

<text>Malcolm Hugh Mackerras AO (born 26 August 1939) is an Australian psephologist and commentator and a lecturer on Australian and American politics.

==Education and works==
Malcolm Mackerras was born at Turramurra in Sydney in August 1939, the son of Alan Mackerras and Catherine, née
MacLaurin. He is a brother of Sir Charles Mackerras, a well-known conductor, and twin brother of Professor Colin Mackerras, a leading China specialist. Another brother, Neil Mackerras, was active in the Democratic Labor Party in its early years. Yet another, Alastair Mackerras, was headmaster (principal) of Sydney Grammar School from 1969 to 1989.

After attending St Aloysius&#x27; College, Milson&#x27;s Point (1947–1951) and Sydney Grammar School (1952-1956) Malcolm was employed by BHP from 1957 to 1960, during which time he studied at night for the degree of Bachelor of Economics at the University of Sydney (awarded 1962).

Mackerras was a member of the ACT Young Liberals in the late 1960s. His second employer was the Federal of the Liberal Party of Australia for which he was a research officer (1960–1967). The organisation moved him to Canberra where he has lived continuously since 1965. He spent several years as a ministerial assistant and three years as an economist with the Chamber of Manufactures (1968–1970), &quot;trying to present the case for protection for Australian manufacturing industry&quot;.

In 1974 Mackerras was employed in the Department of Government at Royal Military College, Duntroon by the University of New South Wales. He went on to become an associate professor in Political Science, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra in 1999. Mackerras retired from the University of New South Wales in 2004. Mackerras is now an Honorary Fellow at Australian Catholic University, Canberra Campus.

He is especially interested in elections and electoral systems. His several books and many journal articles are largely in those areas. He has written many articles for &quot;The Australian&quot; and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; on these subjects. He likes whenever possible to visit countries during their elections. He visited South Africa in 1999 as an observer for that country&#x27;s second democratic election (May–June 1999). He likes, in particular, to be in the United States for a presidential election as it greatly improves his American teaching. During his stay in the US in November–December 2000, there was a &quot;snap&quot; election in Canada, which he visited, enabling him to improve his knowledge of Canadian politics.

Mackerras&#x27;s first published study of Australian politics was &quot;The Australian Senate 1965-1967: Who Held Control?&quot;. He followed this with &quot;The 1968 Federal Redistribution&quot; (1969). His first major work was &quot;Australian General Elections&quot; (1972) in which he pioneered the concept of the two-party majority and the two-party swing, and introduced the &quot;pendulum&quot;, a table of federal electorates in order of two-party majority, now commonly known as the Mackerras Pendulum. He followed this with a series of books before each federal election, such as &quot;Elections 1975&quot;, &quot;Elections 1980&quot;, &quot;The Mackerras 1990 Federal Election Guide&quot; and &quot;The Malcolm Mackerras 1993 Federal Election Guide&quot;.

He is commonly described as a psephologist which means &quot;one who studies elections&quot;. However, he insists that his political science interests are much broader than that. Indeed, one of the reasons for his determination on the November–December 2000 North American visit was to study all the legal manoeuvres in connection with the only &quot;cliffhanger&quot; presidential election of the 20th century. He visited the US again in September 2004 to attend the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association in Chicago.

For the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 he has been specialising in Australian state elections. He visited South Australia in February 2002, Victoria in November–December 2002 and New South Wales in March 2003 for elections in those states, which involved writing newspaper articles plus broadcasting. He did the same for Queensland where a state election was held on 7 February 2004. He did the same for Australia&#x27;s federal election on 9 October 2004.

==Publications==
His two most recent books are &quot;Australian Political Facts: Second Edition&quot; (Macmillan, 1997) which he wrote with Ian McAllister and Carolyn Brown Boldiston and, more recently, &quot;Constitutional Politics: The Republic Referendum and the Future&quot; (University of Queensland Press, 2002), which he edited with John Warhurst of the Australian National University. The two men took opposite sides in the debate over the 1999 Australian republic referendum but have now joined to record the event.

==Election commentary==
Mackerras has been a regular commentator on Australian elections in print, on radio and television on most federal and state elections. He has become well known for his predictions of electoral outcomes. He claims a &quot;win&quot; ratio of two in three and adds, &quot;at least I&#x27;m not boring. The election analyst who makes predictions is far more interesting than one who doesn&#x27;t. And if I collect egg on my face, then so be it.&quot;

An example of an incorrect prediction was the one he made in &quot;The Australian&quot; on 1 November 2004: he said that John Kerry would defeat George W. Bush in a landslide in the U.S. presidential election the following day, and specifically predicted that Kerry would carry Florida, Ohio, Nevada and Missouri.

<doc id="981134" wikidata="Q5083782" url="?curid=981134" title="Charles Young (United States Army officer)">
<text>Charles Young (March 12, 1864 – January 8, 1922) was an American soldier. He was the third African American graduate of the United States Military Academy, the first Black U.S. national park superintendent, first Black military attaché, first Black man to achieve the rank of colonel in the United States Army, and highest-ranking Black officer in the Regular Army until his death in 1922.

In 2022, in recognition of his exemplary service and the barriers he faced due to racism, he was posthumously promoted to brigadier general, and a promotion ceremony was held in his honor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

==Early life and education==
Charles Young was born in 1864 into slavery to Gabriel Young and Arminta Bruen in Mays Lick, Kentucky, a small village near Maysville. However, his father escaped from slavery early in 1865, crossing the Ohio River to Ripley, Ohio, and enlisting in the 5th United States Colored Heavy Artillery Regiment near the end of the American Civil War. His service earned Gabriel and his wife their freedom, which was guaranteed by the 13th Amendment. His mother was literate, which suggests she may have worked as a house slave. The Young family settled in Ripley when Gabriel was discharged in 1866. Gabriel Young received a bonus by continuing to serve in the Army after the war, and he had enough money to buy land and build a house.

In the late nineteenth century Ripley, Ohio was a thriving river town of about 2,500 residents. Before the war, Ripley was a major station on the Underground Railroad, led by men like Rev. John Rankin, a Presbyterian minister, and John P. Parker, a foundry owner and businessman who had been born into slavery, but was able to buy his freedom. Parker was literate and self-educated and he believed the way to equality for Blacks was through education. John Parker was the one who had assisted Gabriel Young in enlisting in the Union Army in 1865.

The Youngs lived on Cherry Street in Ripley. Charles attended the colored school and was also home schooled by his mother. He showed a musical inclination early in life, learning to play the piano and violin and as a teenager played at the AME Church for Sunday services.

In the 1870s, the schools in Ripley were semi-integrated; there were separate black and white schools, but there were a few combined high school classes such as upper-level languages that were integrated, as were graduation exercises. J.C. Shumaker was superintendent of the schools and J.T. Whitson was principal of the colored school. Both men recognized Young&#x27;s potential and encouraged him to complete his education. During his high school years, in addition to the usual courses, Charles learned German and French, graduating with honors in 1881. Of the twenty-one graduates in his class, Young was the only one of African descent. Each of the graduates performed and/or spoke at the ceremony. Charles played a piece on the piano and gave an oration entitled &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;.

Following graduation, before entering West Point, Young taught at the colored school in Ripley. Although there were separate schools for colored and white students, the monthly teacher meetings were integrated. At one of these meetings, Young presented a paper entitled, &quot;We Must Educate&quot;.

During these formative years, in addition to his teachers, Charles was mentored by John Parker. Parker saw the same potential in Young that his teachers did and, consequently, did all he could to encourage Charles to excel; to move beyond his world in Ripley and to do his part to improve the status of his race in America.

In 1883, an ad in the &quot;Ripley Bee,&quot; the local newspaper, announced that an entrance exam for West Point would be given in Hillsboro, Ohio. Young took the exam and, of the twenty-six men who took it, he placed second. Each congressional district could nominate one cadet and Representative Alphonso Hart, of Ohio&#x27;s 12th district, appointed William Stamats, but Stamats resigned the position. Hart then nominated Young in April 1884 and Charles left for West Point in June of that year.

Biographer Brian G. Shellum wrote, &quot;Young was fortunate that his parents eventually settled in Ripley, Ohio. Ripley was a one-of-a-kind community, and the Youngs could have found no better place in Ohio to start their life.&quot;

==West Point==
When Young reported to the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet in 1884, there was already one other Black cadet, John Hanks Alexander, who had entered in 1883 (graduated in 1887). Young and Alexander shared a room for three years at West Point. Young had to repeat his first year when he failed mathematics, delaying his graduation until 1889. Although regularly discriminated against, Young made several lifelong friends among his later classmates, but none among his initial entering class. He later failed an engineering class, but he passed it the second time when he was tutored during the summer by George Washington Goethals, the Army engineer who later directed construction of the Panama Canal and who as an assistant professor took an interest in Young.

As one of the first African Americans to attend and graduate from West Point, Charles Young faced challenges far beyond the traditional hazing experienced by his White peers. He experienced extreme racial discrimination from classmates, faculty, and upperclassmen. Hazing was not an unusual practice at the military academies. Charles Young, however, was subjected to a disproportionate amount of abuse because of his color.

Upon arrival to West Point, Young was welcomed in as &quot;The Load of Coal&quot;. Once, in the mess hall, a White cadet proclaimed that he would not take food from a platter that Young had already taken from. Young passed the White cadet the plate first, allowing him to take from it, then he himself took from the plate. Upperclassmen targeted and Young 140 times, which was considered unusually high. Whereas Young&#x27;s peers were referred to solely by their last names, Young was called &quot;Mr. Young&quot; as a kind of feigned deference. One of Young&#x27;s greatest struggles at West Point was loneliness. A White classmate of Young&#x27;s, Major General Charles D. Rhodes, later reported that it was a practice of Young to converse with some of the servants at West Point in German to maintain some human interaction.

Toward the end of his five-year stay at West Point, the merciless discrimination and taunts decreased. Due to his perseverance, some of Young&#x27;s classmates began to see past the color of his skin. Despite this and by his own admission, Young&#x27;s time at West Point was fraught with difficulty.

==Career==
Young graduated in 1889 (Cullum number 3330) with his commission as a second lieutenant, the third Black man to do so at the time (after Henry Ossian Flipper and John Hanks Alexander, and the last one until Benjamin O. Davis Jr. in 1936). He was first assigned to the Tenth U.S. Cavalry Regiment. Through a reassignment, he served first with the Ninth U.S. Cavalry Regiment, in Nebraska. His subsequent service of 28 years was chiefly with Black troops—the Ninth U.S. Cavalry and the Tenth U.S. Cavalry, Black troops nicknamed the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; since the Indian Wars. The armed services were racially segregated until 1948, when President Harry S. Truman issued executive order.

==Marriage and family==
Young married Ada Mills on February 18, 1904, in Oakland, California. They had two children: Charles Noel, born in 1906 in Ohio, and Marie Aurelia, born in 1909 when Young and his family were stationed in the Philippines.

==Military service==
Young began his service with the Ninth Cavalry, from 1889 to 1890 he served at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, and from 1890 to 1894 at Fort Duchesne, Utah.

In 1894, he was assigned to Wilberforce College in Ohio, an historically black college (HBCU), to lead the new military sciences department, established under a special federal grant. A professor for four years, he was one of several outstanding men on staff, including W. E. B. Du Bois, who became his close friend.

When the Spanish–American War broke out, Young was promoted to the temporary rank of major of volunteers on May 14, 1898. He commanded the 9th Ohio Infantry Regiment which was, in the terminology of the day, a &quot;colored&quot; (i.e. African-American) unit. Despite its name, the 9th Ohio was only battalion sized with four companies. The war ended before Young and his men could be sent overseas. Young&#x27;s command of this unit is significant because it was probably the first time in history an African American commanded a sizable unit of the United States Army and one of the very few instances prior to the late 20th century. He was mustered out of the volunteers on January 28, 1899, and reverted to his regular army rank of first lieutenant. He was promoted to captain in the 9th Cavalry Regiment on February 2, 1901.

===National Park assignments===
In 1903, Young served as captain of a black company at the Presidio of San Francisco. He was then appointed acting superintendent of Sequoia and General Grant national parks, becoming the first Black superintendent of a national park. (At that time the military supervised all national parks.) Because of limited funding, however, the Army assigned its soldiers for short-term assignments during the summers, which made it difficult for the officers to accomplish longer-term goals. Young supervised payroll accounts and directed the activities of rangers.

Young&#x27;s greatest impact on the park was managing road construction, which allow more visitors to enjoy it. Young&#x27;s men accomplished more that summer than had been done under the three officers assigned to the park during the previous three summers. Captain Young&#x27;s troops completed a road to the Giant Forest, home of the world&#x27;s largest trees, and a road to the base of Moro Rock. By mid-August, the wagons of visitors could enter the mountaintop forest for the first time.

With the end of the brief summer construction season, Young was transferred on November 2, 1903, and reassigned as a troop commander of the Tenth Cavalry at the Presidio. In his final report on Sequoia Park to the Secretary of the Interior, he recommended that the government acquire privately held lands there. This recommendation was noted in legislation when it was introduced in the United States House of Representatives.

===Other military assignments===
With the Army&#x27;s founding of the Military Intelligence Department, in 1904 it assigned Young as one of the first military attachés, serving in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He was to collect intelligence on different groups in Haiti, to help identify forces that might destabilize the government. He served there for three years.

In 1908, Young was sent to the Philippines to join his Ninth Regiment and command a squadron of two troops. It was his second tour there. After his return to the United States, he served for two years at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming.

In 1912, Young was assigned as military attaché to Liberia, the first African American to hold that post. On August 28 of that year, he was promoted to major, becoming the first African American to have been promoted to that rank or its equivalent in the regular U. S. armed services. For three years, he served as an expert adviser to the Liberian government and also took a direct role in supervising construction of the country&#x27;s infrastructure. For his achievements, in 1916 the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awarded Young the Spingarn Medal, given annually to the African American demonstrating the highest achievement and contributions.

In 1912, Young published &quot;The Military Morale of Nations and Races,&quot; a study of the cultural sources of military power. He argued against the prevailing theories of the fixity of racial character, using history and social science to demonstrate that even supposedly servile or un-military races (such as Negroes and Jews) displayed martial virtues when fighting for democratic societies. Thus the key to raising an effective mass army from among a polyglot American people was to link patriotic service with fulfillment of the democratic promise of equal rights and fair play for all. Young&#x27;s book was dedicated to Theodore Roosevelt, and invoked the principles of Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;New Nationalism&quot;.

During the 1916 Punitive Expedition by the United States into Mexico, then-Major Young commanded the 2nd Squadron of the 10th United States Cavalry. While leading a cavalry pistol charge against Pancho Villa&#x27;s forces at Agua Caliente (April 1, 1916), he routed the opposing forces without losing a single man.

Because of his exceptional leadership of the 10th Cavalry in the Mexican theater of war, Young was promoted to lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1916, the first African American to attain the rank or its equivalent. He was assigned as commander of Fort Huachuca, the base in Arizona of the Tenth Cavalry, nicknamed the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;, until mid 1917. He was the first African American to achieve the rank of colonel in the US Army.

===Forced retirement===
With the United States about to enter World War I, Young stood a good chance of being promoted to brigadier general. However, there was widespread resistance among White officers, especially those from the segregated South, who did not want to be outranked by an African American. A Southern White lieutenant, Albert Dockery who served under Young complained to the War Department that he did not wish to serve under a Black man, and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker replied that he should &quot;either do his duty or resign.&quot; John Sharp Williams, senator from Mississippi, complained on the lieutenant&#x27;s behalf to President Woodrow Wilson. The President overruled Baker&#x27;s decision and had the lieutenant transferred.

Baker considered sending Young to Fort Des Moines, an officer training camp for African Americans. However, Baker realized that if Young were allowed to fight in Europe with Black troops under his command, he would be eligible for promotion to brigadier general, and it would be impossible not to have White officers serving under him. The War Department instead removed Young from active duty, claiming it was due to his high blood pressure. Young was placed temporarily on the inactive list (with the rank of colonel on June 22, 1917.

In May 1917 Young appealed to Theodore Roosevelt for support of his application for reinstatement. Roosevelt was then in the midst of his campaign to form a &quot;volunteer division&quot; for early service in France in World War I. Roosevelt appears to have planned to recruit at least one and perhaps two Black regiments for the division, something he had not told President Wilson or Secretary of War Baker. He immediately wrote to Young offering him command of one of the prospective regiments, saying &quot;there is not another man [besides yourself] who would be better fitted to command such a regiment.&quot; Roosevelt also promised Young &quot;carte blanche&quot; in appointing staff and line officers for the unit. However, Wilson refused Roosevelt permission to organize his volunteer division.

Young returned to Wilberforce University, where he was a professor of military science through most of 1918. On November 6, 1918, after he had traveled by horseback from Wilberforce, Ohio, to Washington, D.C., to prove his physical fitness, he was reinstated on active duty as a colonel. Baker did not rescind his order that Young be forcibly retired. In 1919, Young was reassigned as military attaché to Liberia.

==Death==
While Young was on a reconnaissance mission in Nigeria in late 1921, he suddenly became debilitatingly ill. Young died of a kidney infection at the British hospital in Lagos on January 8, 1922. Because his death took place in a British hospital, his body was required to be buried in Lagos where it remained for an entire year. During that year, Young&#x27;s wife and many notable African Americans at the time demanded that Young&#x27;s body be brought back from Nigeria so that he could receive &quot;a proper military burial&quot;. More than a year after his death, Young&#x27;s body was finally exhumed and brought back to American soil. When his body finally made it to New York, he received a hero&#x27;s welcome. There were large crowds of people there, all to pay honor to Young&#x27;s long and accomplished military career. He was given a full military funeral and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Section 3 across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. He was the fourth soldier to receive a funeral in Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. He is buried with a large tombstone that states his name, military rank, and year of birth and death; its other side simply says &quot;Young&quot;. He had become a public and respected figure because of his unique achievements in the Army, and his obituary was carried in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Honors and legacy==
===Honors===
Charles Young received honors through his life. One he was presented with was a citation in appreciation of his performance as Acting Superintendent of Sequoia National Park by The Visalia, California, Board of Trade. Later on in 1912, he was elected as an honorary member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He was the second honorary member to be elected to the fraternity. Finally, before his death in 1922, The NAACP awarded him the Spingarn Medal for his achievements in Liberia and the US Army in 1916. In February 2020, Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky posthumously promoted Young to honorary brigadier general in Kentucky; accounts contained no reference to the Kentucky National Guard. Beshear&#x27;s request for federal recognition of Young&#x27;s promotion was approved by Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros on November 1, 2021, with the recognition made effective on February 1, 2022. The promotion ceremony was held on April 29, 2022.

===Legacy===
Since his death, there have been multiple efforts to maintain Young&#x27;s legacy in the United States. This started in 1922, immediately following his death when his obituary appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, demonstrating his national reputation and also his funeral being one of few held at the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery, where he was buried in Section 3. During the 1925–1926 school year, the Portland Colored School in Louisville, Kentucky was renamed the Charles Young School. This school, one of the earlier schools in the US serving African Americans, was open between 1873 and 1956. And at its close, the building was demolished and made into a park bearing Young&#x27;s name. In 2016 the park was rededicated Col. Charles D. Young Park. Seven years after his death, another school was named in his honor: Charles E. Young Elementary School was built along Benning Road in Washington, D.C. It was the first elementary school in Northeast D.C., and oriented to the city&#x27;s Black neighborhoods. However, it was closed in 2008. The building now houses Two Rivers Public Charter School.

From 1941 to 1943, the Colonel Charles Young Soldiers Club was a recreation center for black soldiers in Trenton, New Jersey. After these accomplishments, it was not until 1974 that the house where Young lived when teaching at Wilberforce University was designated a National Historic Landmark, in recognition of his historic importance. In 2001, Senator Mike DeWine introduced Senate Resolution 97 that “honors the bravery and dedication of the Buffalo Soldiers throughout United States and world history; honors one of the Buffalo Soldiers&#x27; most distinguished heroes, Colonel Charles Young, for his lifetime achievements; and recognizes the continuing legacy of the Buffalo Soldiers throughout the world.” In 2013, President Barack Obama used the Antiquities Act to designate Young&#x27;s house as the 401st unit of the National Park System, the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument. In 2018, California passed legislation to name California State Route 198 as Colonel Charles Young Memorial Highway. The State Route&#x27;s east end is in Sequoia National Park where Young served as superintendent. In 2023, Kentucky designated the area from the Camp Nelson National Monument in Jessamine County to the Ohio border at Mays Lick, as the &quot;Brigadier General Charles Young Memorial Historical Corridor&quot;. In 2024, Ohio also designated some of its roadways as the &quot;Brigadier General Charles Young Memorial Historical Corridor&quot;: U.S. Route 42 at Campus Drive (on the Wilberforce University campus), past the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument, southwest to US 68, south to US 62, through Young&#x27;s hometown of Ripley, to the Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge which crosses to Kentucky, for a distance of approximately .

===Literary legacy===
Along with the legacy from acknowledgements and awards, Young has also taken on a presence in African American art and literature. One of the most notable instances was a 1925 poem by Countée Cullen &quot;In Memory of Colonel Charles Young.&quot; The poem accurately predicts the legacy Colonel Charles Young would have for years to come. The poem uses imagery, including Charles Young&#x27;s resting place in the cemetery where &quot;above your grave the tom-toms throb/ and the hills are weird with light.&quot; After Cullen describes a dark world that Young is emerged in, he ends with a hopeful message: &quot;From your rich dust and slaughtered will/ A tree with tongues will grow.&quot; Cullen is implying that he believed Young was the start of a movement; as of 2014, African Americans make up more than twenty percent of active-duty Army members.

W. E. B. Du Bois, who spoke at Young&#x27;s eulogy, claimed that &quot;the life of Charles Young was a triumph of tragedy.&quot; Young is also represented in painting and other art. Notably, a painting by J. W. Shannon titled &quot;Portrait of Cadet Charles Young&quot;, in which the background gives Young a glowing bright background to make him look saintly. The painting currently belongs to the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center, located in Wilberforce, Ohio.

===Popular culture depictions===
In the 2020 alternate history &quot;Shadows of Annihilation&quot; () by S. M. Stirling, Young is depicted as a major general commanding the 32nd Infantry Division, a colored unit in the United States Protectorate of México. Young is also featured in &quot;The Great Abraham Lincoln Pocket Watch Conspiracy&quot;, where he serves as second-in-command to Major Archibald Butt during a secret mission into the Belgian Congo.

<text>Kevin Lee Poulsen (born November 30, 1965) is an American contributing editor at &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, a former black-hat hacker and convicted fraudster.

==Biography==
He was born in Pasadena, California, on November 30, 1965.

On June 1, 1990, Poulsen took over all of the telephone lines for Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, guaranteeing that he would be the 102nd caller and win the prize of a Porsche 944 S2.

When the Federal Bureau of Investigation started pursuing Poulsen, he went underground as a fugitive. A storage company cleared out a storage shed in Poulsen&#x27;s name due to non-payment of rent, where computer equipment was discovered which was furnished to the FBI for evidence. When he was featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, the show&#x27;s 1-800 telephone lines mysteriously crashed. Poulsen was arrested in April 1991 following an investigation led in part by John McClurg.

In June 1994, Poulsen pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy, fraud, and wiretapping. He was sentenced to five years in a federal penitentiary and banned from using computers or the internet for three years after his release. He was the first American to be released from prison with a court sentence that banned him from using computers and the internet after his prison sentence. Although Chris Lamprecht was sentenced first with an internet ban on May 5, 1995, Poulsen was released from prison before Lamprecht and began serving his ban sentence earlier. (Poulsen&#x27;s parole officer later allowed him to use the Internet in 2004, with certain monitoring restrictions).

=== Journalism ===
Poulsen reinvented himself as a journalist after his release from prison and sought to distance himself from his criminal past. Poulsen served in a number of journalistic capacities at California-based security research firm SecurityFocus, where he began writing security and hacking news in early 2000. Despite a late arrival to a market saturated with technology media, &quot;SecurityFocus News&quot; became a well-known name in the tech news world during Poulsen&#x27;s tenure with the company and was acquired by Symantec. Moreover, his original investigative reporting was frequently picked up by the mainstream press. Poulsen left SecurityFocus in 2005 to freelance and pursue independent writing projects. In June 2005, he became a senior editor for &quot;Wired News&quot;, which hosted his blog, 27BStroke6, later renamed Threat Level.

In October 2006, Poulsen released information detailing his successful search for registered sex offenders using MySpace to solicit sex from children. His work identified 744 registered people with MySpace profiles and led to the arrest of one, Andrew Lubrano.

In June 2010, Poulsen broke the initial story of the arrest of U.S. service member Chelsea Manning and published the logs of Manning&#x27;s chats with Adrian Lamo regarding WikiLeaks.

In June 2019, Poulsen was accused of doxing Shawn Brooks, a 34-year-old Trump supporter living in The Bronx, when Poulsen revealed Brooks&#x27; identity in an article published in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; on June 1, 2019 as the alleged creator and disseminator of a fake video which showed Nancy Pelosi speaking in a slurred manner.

=== SecureDrop ===
Poulsen, Aaron Swartz, and James Dolan designed and developed SecureDrop, an open-source software platform for secure communication between journalists and sources. It was originally developed under the name &quot;DeadDrop&quot;. After Swartz&#x27;s death Poulsen launched the first instance of the platform at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, on 15 May 2013. Poulsen later turned over development of SecureDrop to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and joined the foundation&#x27;s technical advisory board.

<doc id="981149" wikidata="Q6636001" url="?curid=981149" title="List of railway lines in New Zealand">
<text>The railway network in New Zealand consists of four main lines, six secondary lines and numerous short branch lines in almost every region. It links all major urban centres except Nelson, Taupō, Queenstown, Whakatāne and (since 2012) Gisborne. The network is owned and managed by KiwiRail. The network was constructed starting in 1863, mostly by government bodies, initially provincial governments and later the central government (usually by the Public Works Department) under the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR or NZGR). In 1981 NZR was corporatised as the New Zealand Railways Corporation, and in 1991 New Zealand Rail Limited was split from the corporation. New Zealand Rail was privatised in 1993 (and later renamed Tranz Rail), with the New Zealand Railways Corporation retaining the land (due to Treaty of Waitangi claims on land taken for railway construction). In 2003 the government renationalised the network. KiwiRail operates all freight lines and a small number of passenger services primarily for tourists on certain routes in both islands; Auckland One Rail operates Auckland Transport &quot;AT Metro&quot; suburban passenger trains in Auckland and Transdev operates Metlink passenger trains in the Wellington region; Dunedin Railways (formerly Taieri Gorge Railway) operates tourist passenger trains in Dunedin.

===Private lines===
Parts of the network were constructed by private companies, and most were unsuccessful. All except the Whakatane Board Mills line and the Sanson Tramway were later acquired by the government. The most successful was the Wellington and Manawatu Railway, which operated between Wellington and Longburn (near Palmerston North) from 1885 to 1908. After the WMR, perhaps the best-known private railway was the New Zealand Midland Railway Company, which constructed parts of the Midland, Nelson and West Coast lines. After the company was dissolved in 1900 the railway lines and their construction were taken over by the government. Some lines were built by companies for access such as to coal mines, and by local government bodies.

===Significant proposals===

Many railway lines have been proposed, especially in the 19th century, but never constructed. An 1873 map indicated that it was intended to link up all the current and authorised routes into a national network. Some proposals have been particularly significant due to their extent, publicity, or how close they came to being realised (in some cases, the track bed was built). Some significant proposals include:
* Auckland Airport Line – an extension of the Onehunga Branch to Auckland Airport, and/or a link from the airport to the NIMT at Puhinui. Other options also mooted.
* Auckland City Rail Link – underground rail link under central Auckland. Now an active project
*Avondale - Southdown Line (land corridor owned by KiwiRail)
*Canterbury Interior Main Line
*Connection of the Catlins River Branch and the Tokanui Branch
*Cromwell – Queenstown, proposed connection with the Kingston Branch extension before Otago Central Railway route chosen.
*Culverden – Reefton line
*Culverden to Tophouse, with branches from there to Nelson and Blenheim
*Dunedin Peninsula and Ocean Beach railway extension to Portobello and Taiaroa Heads.
*Extension of the East Coast Main Trunk Railway to link Gisborne and Rotorua by going inland from Ōpōtiki up the Waiweka Gorge to the Moutohora Branch. So would link the Bay of Plenty to Gisborne and Palmerston North via the Palmerston North – Gisborne Line. 
*Fairlie Branch – extension 27 km beyond Eversley, proposals to terminate the line in Burkes Pass 
*East Cape tourist line via Hicks Bay 
*Haywards–Plimmerton Line between the Hutt Valley Line and the Kapiti Line.
*Kakahi – Pūkawa (Lake Taupō) line
*Kennington – Waikiwi deviation to Invercargill
*Kingston Branch – extension to Queenstown
*Kirikopuni – Kaikohe line
*Kurow Branch – extension beyond Hakataramea
*Lewis Pass Railway (Reefton to Culverden)
*Little River Branch – extension to Akaroa
*Marsden Point Branch and its Waipu precursor
*Martinborough Branch
* Masterton – Waipukurau line via either Pongaroa or Castlepoint
*Mossburn Branch – extension to Te Anau
*Motueka to Tadmor
*Nelson – Blenheim line
*Extension of the Nelson Section through the Buller Gorge to the West Coast.
*Nelson to Cobden and Westport
*North Shore Line – from central Auckland (Britomart) to the North Shore, and extended northward on the route currently occupied by the Northern Busway
*Okaihau Branch – extension to Rangiahua and Kaitaia
*Opunake Branch – sub-branch from Kapuni to Manaia; extension to New Plymouth
*Otago Central Railway – extension to Wānaka
*Paengaroa – Rotorua line
*Paeroa–Pokeno Line 
*Ross – Haast, including rebuilding to heavy rail of the Stewart and Chapman tramway to Lake Ianthe State Forest. 
*Roxburgh Branch – connection from Roxburgh to the Otago Central Railway in Alexandra
*Sockburn-Styx deviation and industrial line.
*Taupō Railway Proposals – connections from Rotorua, Kinleith or Murupara branches
*Te Aro Extension – extension to Island Bay
*Waiau Branch – extension to Kaikōura
*Waimate Branch – extension of the Waihao Downs line
*Wainuiomata Branch – from the Hutt Valley section of the Wairarapa Line to the suburb. 
*Wairau Valley Railway from Tophouse to Blenheim
*Westport to Charleston

See also Hawera &amp; Normanby Star| volume=LVII, 23 August 1910, Page 5 for a list of railways authorised, proposed and under construction, with estimated cost of completing them as at 1 April 1910, many of which were not built.

==Nelson – Blenheim notional railway==
The Nelson - Blenheim notional railway was created in November 1957 to help manage the political backlash from the 1955 closure of the isolated Nelson Section. between Nelson and Blenheim was deemed by law to be an NZR railway for the purposes of calculating passenger and freight rates between railway stations in the South Island and Nelson or other places on the notional railway. Passengers and freight travelled by road, with the difference between the road carrier&#x27;s rates and railway rates subsidised by the government. Rail rates were significantly cheaper than road rates, so the scheme provided significant benefits to its users, while imposing significant costs on the government. The scheme lasted for 22 years, being withdrawn in October 1977.

==Bush tramways==
Bush tramways were industrial tramway lines principally constructed to haul timber or minerals, often in isolated areas. A variety of gauges was used, including the New Zealand standard . Typical bush trams were more lightly constructed than ordinary rail lines and had steeper gradients and sharper curves. With the low speeds that were commonplace, rolling stock and locomotives were generally built to lighter standards than main-line vehicles. It was not uncommon for road vehicles to be adapted, either as haulage power or rolling stock. As road vehicles became more suited for these operations the bush trams gradually faded away and none are now operating.

A prominent example of a bush tramway was the Taupo Totara Timber Company&#x27;s line between Putaruru and Mokai, and an example of a mineral tramway was the Dun Mountain Railway.

Other bush and mineral tramways included -

=== North Island ===
=== South Island ===
==Street tramways==
Major street tramway networks were constructed in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, with smaller operations in Gisborne, Napier, New Plymouth, Wanganui, Nelson and Invercargill. Employing horse, steam or electric power, they operated in most cases until the 1950s when improved buses saw most of the tracks scrapped. Urban tram operations, built from scratch as tourist attractions, have more recently been restarted in Christchurch (1995) Auckland (2011), and Wanganui (2013). See Trams in New Zealand.

==Heritage and Private railways==
A large number of societies operate working heritage railway lines and museums. Most of these are run largely or wholly by volunteer labour, except commercially operated private trust owned Dunedin Railways in Dunedin, which employs paid staff.

<text>Sergey Timofeyevich Aksakov (, ) (—) was a 19th-century Russian literary figure remembered for his semi-autobiographical tales of family life, as well as his books on hunting and fishing.

A crater on the planet Mercury has been named in his honor.

== Early life ==
According to the Velvet Book of Russian genealogy, the Aksakovs trace their male line to Šimon, a Varangian nephew of Haakon the Old, who settled in Novgorod in 1027. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish Przyjaciel coat of arms (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of Tatar origin in Poland (the word «oksak» means «lame» in Turkic languages). All this led some researches to believe that the Aksakov family also originated from Tatars, despite having no relation to the Polish noble house.

Sergey was born in Ufa and brought up there and in the family estate at Novo-Aksakovka in Orenburg guberniya, where he acquired a lifelong love of nature. He was also introduced to literature by his mother at an early age, and became especially fond of Mikhail Kheraskov&#x27;s &quot;Rossiada&quot; and the tragedies of Alexander Sumarokov.

He was educated at the Kazan Gymnasium and then, in 1805 (in the first year after its founding), at Kazan University, though he himself said he was ill-prepared for university education (and some of the professors, brought from abroad, taught in foreign languages). He was also distracted by his obsessive interest in the theater.

== Career ==

He left the university in 1807, and the following year went to St. Petersburg to take up government service, for which he was also poorly prepared. Again, he spent considerable time at the theater, and his acquaintance with the conservative Admiral Shishkov strengthened his preference for classical Russian literature and introduced him to the Lovers of the Russian Word. He resigned from the civil service in 1811 and moved to Moscow, where he was active as an amateur in literary and theatrical life and published his first verse anonymously in 1812.

Aksakov enlisted in the militia and took part in the Campaign of 1812; afterwards he settled for the quiet life of a sporting country squire at his estate of Aksakovo in Orenburg guberniya, where he stayed from 1816 until 1826, after which he was usually in Moscow. In 1816 he married Olga Semenovna Zaplatina, and the couple had six sons and eight daughters. His eldest daughter Vera Aksakova who was born in 1819 was also a noted author.

He began publishing translations, reviews, and articles in the early 1820s, though his important work came much later. In 1827 he was appointed to the Moscow Censorship Committee, from which he was dismissed in 1832 for allowing the publication of a &quot;scurrilous&quot; pamphlet on drunken policemen; in 1833 he became an inspector at the Grand Duke Constantine School of Surveying, and in 1835 the first director of the Constantine Geodetic Institute (&quot;Konstantinovsky mezhevoi institut&quot;). He retired from the civil service in 1838.

In 1832 he met Nikolai Gogol &quot;and recognized in him what he had failed to see in Púshkin or any other man—a purely Russian genius. Aksakov&#x27;s house, a stronghold of pure Russianism in Moscow society, became the temple of the cult of Gogol, and Aksakov its high priest.&quot; It was Gogol who revealed to Aksakov the possibility of creating literature based directly on life, without forcing it into the mold of classical forms. In 1834 Aksakov published his first realistic story, &quot;A Blizzard.&quot; Around 1840, encouraged by Gogol, he began writing the book that would make him famous, &quot;A Family Chronicle&quot;. While he was working on that, he published books about two of his favorite activities since his youth, &quot;Notes on Fishing&quot; (1847) and &quot;Notes of a Hunter in Orenburg Province&quot; (1852). Their &quot;limpid style and concrete content,&quot; which were &quot;almost unique in Russian literature,&quot; were appreciated by contemporaries; Ivan Turgenev reviewed them enthusiastically, and Gogol wrote Aksakov, &quot;Your birds and fishes are more alive than my men and women.&quot;

== Later life ==

In 1843 Aksakov settled in the village of Abramtsevo, near Moscow, where he entertained writers including Gogol, Turgenev, and Tolstoy and which was also frequented by his Slavophile sons, Konstantin and Ivan. In the late 1850s he published his most enduring works, &quot;The Family Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Semeinaya khronika&quot;, 1856; translated as &quot;A Russian Gentleman&quot;) and &quot;Childhood Years of Bagrov Grandson&quot; (&quot;Detskie gody Bagrova-vnuka&quot;, 1858, translated as &quot;Years of Childhood&quot;). These reminiscences of a childhood spent in a Russian patriarchal family &quot;brought Aksakov recognition as a literary artist of the first rank.&quot; Aksakov&#x27;s semi-autobiographical narratives are unmatched for their scrupulous and detailed description of the everyday life of the Russian nobility.

Among Aksakov&#x27;s other works are &quot;The History of My Acquaintance with Gogol&quot; (&quot;Istoriya moego znakomstva s Gogolem&quot;, published 1890 [written in 1830s and 1840s]); &quot;Memoirs&quot; (&quot;Vospominaniya&quot;, 1856, translated as &quot;A Russian Schoolboy&quot;), and &quot;Collecting Butterflies&quot; (&quot;Sobiranie babochek&quot;, 1858). His fairy tale &quot;The Scarlet Flower&quot; was adapted into an animated feature film in the Soviet Union in 1952.

==Family==
Aksakov married Olga Semyonovna Zaplatina who was the daughter of Major General Semyon Grigorievich Zaplatin and a captured Turkish woman. They had four sons (Konstantin, Gregory, Ivan and Mikhail) and seven daughters (Vera, Olga, Nadezhda, Anna, Lyubov, Maria, and Sophia).

<doc id="981153" wikidata="Q897010" url="?curid=981153" title="Exergonic process">
<text>An exergonic process is one which there is a positive flow of energy from the system to the surroundings. This is in contrast with an endergonic process. Constant pressure, constant temperature reactions are exergonic if and only if the Gibbs free energy change is negative (∆&quot;G&quot; &lt; 0). &quot;Exergonic&quot; (from the prefix exo-, derived for the Greek word ἔξω &quot;exō&quot;, &quot;outside&quot; and the suffix -ergonic, derived from the Greek word ἔργον &quot;ergon&quot;, &quot;work&quot;) means &quot;releasing energy in the form of work&quot;. In thermodynamics, work is defined as the energy moving from the system (the internal region) to the surroundings (the external region) during a given process.

All physical and chemical systems in the universe follow the second law of thermodynamics and proceed in a downhill, i.e., &quot;exergonic&quot;, direction. Thus, left to itself, any physical or chemical system will proceed, according to the second law of thermodynamics, in a direction that tends to lower the free energy of the system, and thus to expend energy in the form of work. These reactions occur spontaneously.

A chemical reaction is also exergonic when spontaneous. Thus in this type of reactions the Gibbs free energy decreases. The entropy is included in any change of the Gibbs free energy. This differs from an exothermic reaction or an endothermic reaction where the entropy is not included. The Gibbs free energy is calculated with the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation:

: formula_1

where:

: &quot;T&quot; = temperature in kelvins (K)
: Δ&quot;G&quot; = change in the Gibbs free energy
: Δ&quot;S&quot; = change in entropy (at 298 K) as Δ&quot;S&quot; = Σ{&quot;S&quot;(Product)} − Σ{&quot;S&quot;(Reagent)}
: Δ&quot;H&quot; = change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as Δ&quot;H&quot; = Σ{&quot;H&quot;(Product)} − Σ{&quot;H&quot;(Reagent)}

A chemical reaction progresses spontaneously only when the Gibbs free energy decreases, in that case the Δ&quot;G&quot; is negative. In exergonic reactions the Δ&quot;G&quot; is negative and in endergonic reactions the Δ&quot;G&quot; is positive:

<text>Augie March are an Australian pop and indie rock band formed in 1996 in Shepparton, Victoria. Since 2001 the group consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Glenn Richards, lead guitarist Adam Donovan, bass guitarist Edmondo Ammendola, drummer David Williams, and keyboardist Kiernan Box. Box had replaced Robert Dawson, the band&#x27;s piano player since March 2000, who died in January 2001.

Augie March&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Sunset Studies&quot;, was released in 2000. It was critically acclaimed and received four ARIA Music Award nominations in 2001, which won Engineer of the Year for Chris Dickie, Chris Thompson, Paul McKercher and Richard Pleasance. Critics, both in Australia and the United States, also lauded its 2002 successor, &quot;Strange Bird&quot;. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; (2006), reached number 10 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It provided the lead single, &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot;, which attained critical acclaim and provided their highest position on the related singles chart at number 29. The album and single were nominated for six ARIA Music Awards in 2006, while &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; won the Australian Music Prize for that year. Having achieved mainstream success, the band toured Australia and the US through 2006 and 2007.

In 2008 they released their fourth album, &quot;Watch Me Disappear&quot;, which reached number 4. Although commercially successful it received less favourable critical reception. Augie March disbanded in late 2009 and reformed in mid-2014. They have released three studio albums since their resumption. The band&#x27;s distinctive musical style is directed by main songwriter, Richards. His lyrics draw critical acclaim for their poetic style. The band&#x27;s music is variously described as intricate, lush, and dense, acting as a backdrop for Richards&#x27; complex vocals.

== History ==

===Formation and early EPs (1996–1999)===
Augie March were formed in the Victorian rural city of Shepparton in 1996 with the original line-up of Edmondo Ammendola on bass guitar, Adam Donovan on lead guitar, Glenn Richards on vocals and guitar, and David Williams on drums. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;[they] won critical praise for [their] mix of literate, sensitive pop and chamber folk.&quot; Donovan, Richards and Williams grew up and attended school in the Shepparton area. Richards began writing songs while studying English literature at University of Melbourne in 1996. He invited Donovan and Williams, who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE (NMIT), to form the band. The pair asked fellow NMIT student, Ammendola to join. The band&#x27;s name references the titular protagonist of the 1953 novel &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; by Saul Bellow. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Gregory McIntosh, who cites the novel&#x27;s &quot;poetic, complex prose&quot; as complementary to Richards&#x27; lyrics.

Augie March relocated to Melbourne before their first performance in Brunswick at a friend&#x27;s visual art exhibition. In 1997 they were signed to Ra Records (rooArt subsidiary distributed by BMG). Augie March&#x27;s first extended play (EP), &quot;Thanks for the Memes&quot;, was produced by Victor Van Vugt (Beth Orton, Nick Cave). The five-track EP was released in January 1998. Despite positive reviews it received little airplay. It was re-released in mid-2003 with an additional track, &quot;300 Nights&quot;. Greg Lawrence of &quot;Worldwide Home of Australasian Music and More Online (WHAMMO)&quot; observed that the six-track version displayed, &quot;dynamic arrangements, an endless lyrical depth and the ability to rock with intensity.&quot; In 2007 Williams described his surprise that they had found a producer, due to their obscure music, which at the time they considered, &quot;hip and cool, and intellectual.&quot;

Augie March followed with their second EP, &quot;Waltz&quot;, in August 1999, which was produced by Richard Pleasance (Deborah Conway, Nick Barker#1993-1995: Barker). The EP included &quot;Asleep in Perfection&quot;, which became the most requested song on Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s &quot;rage&quot; program. The song was nominated for Breakthrough Artist – Single, and Pleasance for Producer of the Year, at the ARIA Music Awards of 2000. The band toured Australia, including to Perth, and their popularity increased through word of mouth. BMG offered Augie March a recording contract, which they accepted.

===Early albums (2000–2003)===
Augie March went into the studio in March 2000 to begin work on their first full-length album, &quot;Sunset Studies&quot;. Richards&#x27; friend, Rob Dawson, officially joined the band on keyboards and piano, after being a studio musician on &quot;Thanks for the Memes&quot; and &quot;Waltz&quot;. Richards returned to Shepparton to write the material for the album. The band worked in nine studios with six different engineers over the course of six months. In July 2000 they released its first single, &quot;Hole in Your Roof&quot;. In October 2000 &quot;Sunset Studies&quot; appeared. The group attempted to organise launches in Sydney and Melbourne, however, they were thwarted, Donovan explained &quot;it seemed like every band in the country was doing a tour then and we couldn&#x27;t get any venues.&quot; They undertook a tour along Australia&#x27;s east coast. The album peaked at number 35 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

&quot;Sunset Studies&quot;″ critical reception was generally positive; Noel Mengel of &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; said that on the album, &quot;songs of quiet reflection, starkly beautiful melodies and intimate poetry collide on the canvas without a thought to sales graphs or what radio program directors might think,&quot; while AllMusic&#x27;s Jack Rabid told American readers &quot;it&#x27;s worth the effort to track down [the album], particularly for those who think there are no more musical craftsmen out there.&quot; The album earned the ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year for 2001, and received nominations for Producer of the Year, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Cover Art for Sam Hickey&#x27;s work. Of the album&#x27;s six engineers, Pleasance, Paul McKercher, Chris Thompson and Chris Dickie qualified for the ARIA Award for best engineer. McKercher and Pleasance, as well as the band, were named producers. Of the singles released from this album, &quot;There Is No Such Place&quot; was their most popular, which was listed at number 47 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001 listeners poll.
Preparations for a follow-up to &quot;Sunset Studies&quot; were disrupted on 2 January 2001 when Robert Dawson died in a two-car collision near Bairnsdale, Victoria, the other driver also died. Dawson&#x27;s death had a significant impact on the band, especially on Richards who was writing for their second album, &quot;Strange Bird&quot;. However, it is not mournful; Richards described it as optimistic and humorous. Melburnian Kiernan Box (ex-the Blackeyed Susans) joined the group on harmonica, organ, piano and piano accordion. The band produced &quot;Strange Bird&quot; independently; Donovan said this worked to their advantage as they felt more comfortable in their own studio, and that as a result &quot;Strange Bird&quot; was a better album than &quot;Sunset Studies&quot;, though the band&#x27;s debut album was &quot;probably received better by our fans.&quot; In response to previous complaints about misinterpretations of Richards&#x27; &quot;Sunset Studies&quot; wordplay, Augie March included a lyrics booklet with &quot;Strange Bird&quot;.

&quot;Strange Bird&quot; was released by BMG as the band&#x27;s second studio album in October 2002. It was also released by spinART Records in the United Kingdom in that month. It was re-released in the United States in September 2004. &quot;Strange Bird&quot; reached number 34 on the ARIA charts, while its lead single, &quot;The Vineyard&quot;, peaked at number 31. Augie March undertook the Strange Bird Tour around Australia. The critical response to &quot;Strange Bird&quot; was largely positive, and by the following June, Williams was mystified. He explained to &quot;Rip It Up!&quot;″s Scott McLennan, &quot;I could see a few holes in the album and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;how come no one else has picked this up?&#x27; I stopped reading our album reviews for a while.&quot; Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey in &quot;The Independent&quot; said &quot;My favourite of the year is Augie March&#x27;s &quot;Strange Bird&quot;&quot;, while David Fricke wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; of &quot;luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur.&quot; Donovan told &quot;Beat Magazine&quot;″s Karen Conrad that the band found it hard to take the &quot;flattering&quot; reviews too seriously, &quot;if we did our heads would explode or overinflate.&quot;

===Mainstream breakthrough (2004–2009)===
Augie March returned to the studio in 2004 to record their third album, &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot;. The band worked with two producers, McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan explained this suited the band&#x27;s style; they co-produced their albums, as they were interested in improving production. It enabled them to work at their own pace. Also during that time BMG merged with Sony Music Australia, hence the gap of three-and-a-half years since &quot;Strange Bird&quot;.

In the interim they released a DVD, &quot;Drones &amp; Vapid Ditties&quot;, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot;, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March added finishing touches. In March 2006, &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot;, appeared and they received critical acclaim and mainstream success. The album spent 21 weeks on the ARIA Albums Chart top 50, peaking at number ten. The album was certified platinum in Australia. Its lead single &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; reached number 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

Work by Augie March was nominated for six more ARIA Music Awards in 2006, including &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; for Single of the Year. Contrary to media speculation, the band did not win any further ARIAs. The group were also popular with national youth radio listeners as &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; topped Triple J Hottest 100, 2006 poll. The album was nominated for the 2006 J Award. A 2008 &quot;The Australian&quot; poll ranked &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; at No. 10 on their best Australian song of the past 20 years list.
Augie March&#x27;s musical abilities were acknowledged when &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; won the second annual Australian Music Prize in 2006 for &quot;the most outstanding and creative Australian album released in the past year.&quot; Ammendola told &quot;Drum Media&quot;″s Andrew Street that this award was more significant than an ARIA: it is &quot;nominated on the grounds of music, and the art of it – not necessarily record sales.&quot; The band used the A$25,000 prize money to fund their second US tour. Richards explained that they had no expectation of a US breakthrough and if this second attempt was not successful, they would not try again.

Augie March played in Los Angeles and New York in May 2007. In August of that year, &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; was released in the US via Jive Zomba. Additional US shows followed, where they were praised by local media. Joe Tangari of &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; called it a &quot;crime&quot; that the band had not broken through in North America earlier, though AllMusic&#x27;s Ben Peterson remarked that &quot;Strange Bird&quot; was a higher quality album than its follow-up. Despite the Australian success of &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot;, much of the group&#x27;s post-album touring was backing other artists. They played shows supporting the Aliens and Andrew Bird in the US, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band&#x27;s status as an opening act, rather than head-liner, was a challenge—their intention was to win over the main act&#x27;s fans. He described the Aliens tour as depressing; they played different types of music and attendances were small. Augie March had a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.
Richards was now expected by Sony BMG&#x27;s agents to produce a quality follow-up, they persisted with, &quot;Richo, have you got a single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?&quot; Much of the writing for their fourth album, &quot;Watch Me Disappear&quot;, took place while touring the US, which Richards argued minimised the band&#x27;s opportunities to be creative. In 2008 they began recording at Neil Finn&#x27;s Auckland studios; and followed with studios in Melbourne, Sydney and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand to get away from distractions in Melbourne and focussing on recording.

Augie March worked with producer, Joe Chiccarelli, who took a significant pay cut after declaring his interest in their music. According to Richards, the production occurred with &quot;a fair bit of friction.&quot; Ammendola was critical of Chiccarelli&#x27;s style and the short time they spent in the studio. The recording process also took its toll on relationships within the band. Ammendola declared, &quot;It tore us to bits. It was really really shit, we&#x27;re slowly patching up now.&quot; After uploading the album&#x27;s title track on their website for free downloading, Augie March announced their &quot;proper headline tour of their homeland,&quot; where they would play music from that album. The album was released in October 2008 and its reception was mixed compared with its predecessors. Patrick Donovan of &quot;The Age&quot; wrote, &quot;[Y]ou get the feeling that [it] will please more than just their mates and old fans,&quot; but Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; felt it was &quot;an album that no doubt will polarise fans.&quot; &quot;Watch Me Disappear&quot; entered the ARIA Albums Chart at number four – their highest position.

Augie March played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief, a multi-venue rock music concert in support of relief for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground. All the proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief. Appearing with Augie March in Melbourne were, Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells, Gabriella Cilmi, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar-Daley, Jack Johnson, Jet, Kings of Leon, Liam Finn, Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Split Enz and Wolfmother.

In July 2009, &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; was voted number 59 by the Australian public in Triple J Hottest 100 of all time. That same month, the band undertook the Watch Me Set My Strange Sun You Bloody Choir tour, where they played every state capital and many regional towns, performing each of their four albums. In December 2009 the band went into hiatus. Richards released his first solo album, &quot;Glimjack&quot;, in 2010.

===Reformation after hiatus (2014–present)===

After four-and-a-half years, on 16 June 2014, Augie March announced—via their official Facebook page—that they are off hiatus. A week later the band posted that they have been working on a full-length album, &quot;Havens Dumb&quot;, for the last two-and-a-half years. It was released on 3 October 2014 and was rated at 3.5 out-of 5 stars by Zuel, who find, &quot;Australia&#x27;s complex/troubled relationships between mateship v exclusion, honour v greed, and history v mythology has become more pronounced.&quot; On 23 February 2018, Augie March released their sixth album, &quot;Bootikins&quot;. According to the band&#x27;s website, it was written and recorded in Melbourne and Hobart and was produced by Australian producer Tony Cohen shortly before he died. In December 2021, the band released its seventh album, &quot;Bloodsport &amp; Porn&quot;. Three years later, their eighth album &quot;Malagrotta&quot; was released, composed from &quot;notes made on a mobile phone while in the grip of a species of long Covid and a brutal high European Summer&quot;.

In November 2023, Augie March collaborated with Romy Vager and released a cover of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&#x27; &quot;Henry Lee&quot;.

==Musical style==


While Augie March generally fall into an indie/pop rock genre, their ability to mix other genres into their style at times makes classifying their musical style difficult. A common thread that runs through the band&#x27;s sound is Richards&#x27; literate and often verbose lyrics, which have set the band apart from much of the rest of the Australian music scene. Even early on in their career, Richards&#x27; unique lyrical style, largely influenced by poets A.D. Hope and Kenneth Slessor, attracted attention and critical acclaim, with one reviewer describing him as &quot;unique&quot;, &quot;refreshing&quot;, and &quot;intellectual&quot;. Allmusic&#x27;s Jack Rabid said Richards &quot;exhibits a honey voice&quot; on &quot;Sunset Studies&quot;, but &quot;Grok&quot; pointed out that the album was rendered too complex or intricate for a mainstream audience.

Richards&#x27; passion for poetry and literary studies again stood out on &quot;Strange Bird&quot;. John D. Luerssen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;poetry aficionado Richards puts his own literary stamp&quot; on the album, and James Christopher Monger of Allmusic said the album contained &quot;pastoral beauty, labyrinthine arrangements, and breathtaking prose&quot;. Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Joe Tangari described the album as &quot;so stuffed with ideas and instruments that it&#x27;s wont to rupture from time to time&quot;. This was both a positive and negative criticism; Tangari complained that at times &quot;there is a surplus of sound&quot;, but also said that the combination of the first two tracks—&quot;The Vineyard&quot; (&quot;slow beauty&quot;) and &quot;This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers&quot; (&quot;a wailing rockabilly psych raver&quot;)—was an excellent set-up. Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine called the opening trio—the third song being the &quot;simple acoustic guitar and arcing piano&quot; of &quot;Little Wonder&quot;—bewildering, and that the album remained consistently as such throughout. PopMatters&#x27; Zeth Lundy described Richards&#x27; wordplay as frenzied, and said the &quot;refined, worldly wit&quot; on &quot;Strange Bird&quot; was striking.

Where &quot;Strange Bird&quot; was brimming with musical content, on &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; Augie March were more simplified, while still maintaining some of the critically acclaimed aspects of their music. Ammendola considered their third album, led by &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot;, to be significantly different from their previous releases. Chad Grischow of IGN wrote of &quot;lush, mesmerizing music meld with gorgeous melodies brought to life by Richards&#x27; rich vocals that wrap themselves around each instrument&quot;. In &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Bernard Zuel argued the album was more subdued; &quot;the tempos and the arrangements are a little quieter and simpler&quot;. Richards&#x27; lyrics, however, still drew praise; &quot;he writes with a 19th-century novelist&#x27;s ear and a Dylanesque tongue&quot;. Miller of Stylus also touched on the fact that &quot;&quot;Moo&quot; is as direct a shot as you&#x27;ll ever get at Augie March&quot;, but that it was nonetheless a &quot;refining and continuation&quot; of the band&#x27;s work thus far. Shirley Halperin, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, said the album featured &quot;smooth, emotive vocals mingle with soaring melodies that&#x27;d make Paul McCartney proud&quot;. Dan Raper of PopMatters said the lyrics to &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; were poetic, citing the lines &quot;Well put me in a cage full of lions / I&#x27;ll learn to speak lion / In fact I know the language well&quot;, as well as the &quot;full and glorious&quot; chorus;

&quot;Watch Me Disappear&quot; was Augie March&#x27;s most mainstream pop work to date, described as a further distillation of the band&#x27;s earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal of much of the backing instrumentation which had acted as &quot;clutter&quot; around Richards&#x27; vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was &quot;a slow burner that takes time to get to know you, but once it does, it&#x27;s a friend for good&quot;. Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of &quot;One Crowded Hour&quot; as &quot;likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals&quot;. She noted a &quot;commercial potential&quot; for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.
== Songwriting ==

Songwriting for Augie March is primarily initiated by Richards; he delivers demos to the rest of the band members who then collaborate with him to develop the music. Kathy McCabe of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggests &quot;almost every songwriter in Australia has name-checked [Richards] as one of the finest tunesmiths of his generation&quot; and that &quot;Richards is a storyteller who is spoken of in reverential terms by peers&quot;. Richards simply states that he enjoys &quot;dabbling with words&quot;, and that people often appreciate him doing so. Despite this, Richards rejects the &quot;literary&quot; reputation he believes the band have gained. At the 2006 ARIA Awards, Midnight Oil&#x27;s Rob Hirst called for more political songs; Richards told Simon Collins of &quot;The West Australian&quot; he saw great risk in writing political music, and would rather write music that rung true, so that &quot;I can sing the song a thousand times after it&#x27;s been written&quot;. Richards asserts he preferred to draw on everyday experiences than on literary influences. He also says that some of the music he writes is intentionally confusing.

The band, and especially Richards, are noted for their perfectionism. In a post-&quot;Sunset Studies&quot; interview with &quot;Grok&quot; magazine in 2000, Williams criticised the song &quot;The Good Gardener (On How He Fell)&quot;, to which the interviewer noted &quot;the Augie March perfectionism ... a slavish, romantic, almost passionate pursuit&quot;. This meme continued throughout Augie March&#x27;s career; following the release of &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot;, Richards said he was not truly happy with anything he had produced so far. Ammendola agreed, and added that the band considered &quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; the weakest of their first three albums, and &quot;Sunset Studies&quot; the best. Richards later stated that he considered &quot;Watch Me Disappear&quot; his best album yet. Andrew Murfett wrote in &quot;The Age&quot; that for Augie March, &quot;creative tension, adverse circumstances and perfectionism seem to go hand in hand&quot;.

== Live concerts ==
While early live performances were criticised, performances post-&quot;Moo, You Bloody Choir&quot; have earned great and consistent praise. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lauded an Augie March concert he saw in New York, which assisted the band in making inroads in the United States.

Over the years, the band have built up a loyal audience, who enjoy frequent and repeated attendance at Augie March shows. Glenn Richards has stated that this has been a great asset to the band. &quot;We have a pretty great fan base&quot; Richards said &quot;they get it&quot;.

<text>Mary (; Cyrillic: Мары, 1992–1993: Marx) is a city on an oasis in the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, located on the Murgab River. It was founded in 1884 about from the ruins of the ancient abandoned great city of Merv and was actually named Merv until 1937. 

Mary is the capital city of Mary Region. In 2022, Mary had a population of 167,000, up from 92,000 in the 1989 census.

==Etymology==
Atanyýazow notes that the name &quot;Muru&quot; appears in Zoroastrian texts alongside the toponyms Sogd (Sogdia) and Bakhti (Bactria), and that the name &quot;Margiana&quot; appears carved into rocks at Behistun, Iran, dating back 2,500 years. Atanyyazow adds, &quot;the name was used in the form Merv-ash-Shahizhan&quot;, with subsequent forms including Muru, Mouru, Margiana, Marg, Margush, Maru, Maru-shahu-jahan, Maru-Shahu-ezan, Merv, and Mary, and that some scholars interpret the word &quot;marg&quot; as &quot;green field&quot; or &quot;grassland&quot;, noting that in Persian &quot;marg&quot; can mean a source of livestock.

==History==
The ancient city of Merv was an oasis city on the Silk Road. It was destroyed and its population annihilated in the 13th century by the Mongols. Because of its location on the Silk Road, it revived over time only to be largely destroyed again in the 19th century by nomadic Teke raiders. Edmund O&#x27;Donovan described Merv in 1882 as

Mary was founded in 1884 as a Russian military and administrative post (and named after the nearby ancient city of Merv) after Imperial Russia occupied the area earlier that same year, which triggered the Panjdeh incident between Afghanistan, British forces, and the Imperial Russian Army. 

In August 1918, a force of the British Indian Army consisting of a machine gun detachment comprising 40 Punjabi troops and a British officer resisted the Bolsheviks near Mary (then Merv) in what was the first direct confrontation between British and Russian troops since the Crimean War.

Later, the Soviet Union developed the area around Mary as a center for cotton production through the use of extensive irrigation. The &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; article on Mary reads in part,

In 1968, huge reserves of natural gas were discovered 20 kilometers west of the city in the Shatlyk Gas Field.

Mary became the center of Mary Province on 18 May 1992, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Turkmen proclamation of independence.

In the 2000s, many streets and new residential areas were built. The new airport terminal was constructed, as was a new building for the Turkmen State Power Engineering Institute, a theater, the new library, a new historical museum, the Palace of Spirituality (), the Margush Hotel, a medical diagnostic center, the Ene Mähri obstetric-pediatric medical center, the Gurbanguly Hajji Mosque, a stadium, an equestrian complex, an indoor swimming pool, and a new railway station.

In 2012, the city was declared one of the cultural capitals of the CIS.

<text>Tejen (older spellings: Tedzhen, Tejend, Tejent) is an oasis city in the Karakum Desert, in Ahal Province of Turkmenistan. It lies along the M37 highway, between Dushak and Mary, by road southeast of Ashgabat. It has a population of approximately 67,500. To the east is the larger oasis of Mary. Khlopin suggests Tejen may have been the birthplace of Zoroaster.

==Etymology==
The meaning of &quot;tejen&quot; is unclear. Atanyyazov explained, ...The meaning of this ancient name is not clear...Barthold noted that this name was also used in the form of Tuzhen in the X-XI centuries...Vambery derived it from the words &quot;tei-e hend&quot; (&quot;tei-e kent&quot;, &quot;tei&quot;— “down”, &quot;kent&quot; - “village”, “city”) and derived from that “downstream of the city,” “downstream of the city,” or “downstream of the river&quot;. He writes that he may have understood the meaning of the word as &quot;city in the desert&quot;...the name of the village along the Gerrud River is mentioned...This name also means &quot;the foot of the city&quot;...As Barthold rightly points out, this name is not the name of the first river, but the name of the county, village, or land, for the river itself is in its upper reaches Hererrud (Herat-rud, i.e., the &quot;Herat River&quot;), and below Sarahs is Khushk-rud, i.e., it was known as the &quot;Waterless River&quot;...In Persian &quot;khushk&quot; means &quot;dry&quot;, &quot;shroud&quot;, &quot;rud&quot; - &quot;river&quot;. This name is a characteristic sign of the river, that is, it is associated with the cutting off of its water in the summer. 
==History==
In 1883 it was occupied by General Komarov during the Russian conquest of Turkestan.
In 1916, when the Turkmens participated in a revolt against the Russians, Tejen was a hotbed of activity.

Tejen was downgraded from a city with district status to a city in a district on 9 November 2022 by parliamentary decree.

==Climate==
==Economy==
Tejen is known for its melon production, and contains numerous textile factories. The city features one hotel, the Hotel Tejen. Tejen is the site of the $240 million Tejen Carbamide (urea) Plant, inaugurated on March 18, 2005, with a design capacity of 350,000 tonnes of urea per year. It is also known for its narcotics, which are known locally as &quot;Tejen tea&quot;.

==Government installations==
A prison is located in Tejen.
==Landmarks==
The city contains the Charman Ahun Mosque and the Hotel Tejen.
==Wildlife==
Historical records indicate that the Caspian tiger was found in this region.
== Transport ==
It is a stop on the Trans-Caspian railway, and in the 1996 a new rail line via Sarahs to Mashhad in Iran was opened. Tejen is located on the M37 highway, and the P-7 highway leads south from Tejen to Sarahs and onward to Iran.

=== Autobahn ===
Tejen is linked to Aşgabat, Mary, Türkmenabat and neighbouring countries by the country&#x27;s 970 km motorway network.

<text>William Edmond Lescaze (March 27, 1896 – February 9, 1969) was a Swiss-born American architect, city planner and industrial designer. He is ranked among the pioneers of modernism in American architecture.

==Early life and education==

Lescaze was born in Onex, Switzerland. He studied at the Collège Calvin and at the École des Beaux-Arts, before completing his formal education at the ETH Zurich, where Karl Moser was a teacher, receiving his degree in 1919.

==Career==
Lescaze contributed to the post-World War I reconstruction effort in Arras, and then immigrated to the United States in 1920. He worked for some time at the architectural firm of Hubbell &amp; Benes in Cleveland, Ohio, and taught French at the local YMCA&#x27;s night classes.

In 1923, he was offered a modeling job and moved to New York City where he set up his business. His first major work was the design of the Oak Lane Country Day School outside Philadelphia. After a brief time in New York, he returned to Cleveland.

In 1927, he designed the Sutton House Apartments project in New York City. Income from the project allowed him to move back to New York City.

In 1929, Philadelphia architect George Howe invited William Lescaze to form a partnership, Howe &amp; Lescaze. Within just a few weeks after joining forces, the duo began work on a large project for downtown Philadelphia. The resulting structure, completed in 1932, was the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) Building, which is today generally considered the first International Modernist skyscraper, and the first International Style building of wide significance in the United States. It was also the first building with full air conditioning. Lescaze is generally given credit for the design: letters from Howe to Lescaze quote the former insisting to the latter that &quot;the design is definitely yours.&quot; The structure replaced the bank&#x27;s former headquarters in Philadelphia, a classicist structure near Washington Square built in 1897.

In 1930, Howe &amp; Lescaze submitted a design for the new building of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The wood and metal model was donated to the MOMA in 1994. In 1935, William Lescaze established his own architecture firm, Lescaze &amp; Associates.

His 1937 Alfred Loomis house in Tuxedo Park, NY is regarded as an early experiment in double-skin facade construction. In 1939 he designed a futuristic &quot;House for 2089&quot; that included a helipad on the roof.

Lescaze was also the design lead for the 1937 Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn, a pioneering 20-building modernist housing project modeled on European examples. He later taught industrial design at the Pratt Institute (1943–1945). Among his built works were the CBS West Coast studios Columbia Square on Sunset Boulevard (1938).

Lescaze also designed the office building at 711 Third Avenue, the city and municipal courts building in the Civic Center in Manhattan, and the High School of Art and Design. From 1949 to 1959, he served at the State Building Code Commission He was a proponent of modern architecture, stating it was the only architecture that could solve the housing problem.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Mary Hughes. His son Lee Adrien Lescaze (1938–1996) was an editor for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Death==
Lescaze died on February 9, 1969, of a heart attack at his home at 211 East 48th Street in Manhattan.

<doc id="981184" wikidata="Q441518" url="?curid=981184" title="Henry G. Davis">
<text>Henry Gassaway Davis (November 16, 1823 – March 11, 1916) was an American politician and businessman who served as a United States Senator from West Virginia from 1871 to 1883. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1904.

Born on a farm in Howard County, Maryland, Davis became a railroad executive before branching out into coal mining and banking as founder of the Potomac and Piedmont Coal and Railway Company. He won election to both houses of the West Virginia Legislature before serving in the U.S. Senate. His younger brother, Thomas Beall Davis, also served in Congress. After his tenure in the Senate ended, Davis continued to grow his business interests. In partnership with his son-in-law, Stephen Benton Elkins, Davis created the Davis Coal and Coke Company and led it to become one of the largest coal companies in the world.

The 1904 Democratic National Convention nominated a ticket of Alton B. Parker for president and Davis for vice president. Davis was chosen primarily for his ability to provide funding to the campaign. At 80 years old, he was the oldest person ever on a major American party&#x27;s national ticket. The Republican ticket of Theodore Roosevelt and Charles W. Fairbanks prevailed by a wide margin. After the election, Davis helped establish Davis &amp; Elkins College. He died in Washington, D.C., at age 92.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Henry Gassaway Davis was born near Woodstock, Howard County, Maryland, the son of Louisa Warfield (née Brown; March 10, 1799 – July 23, 1868) and merchant Caleb Dorsey Davis (March 3, 1792 – September 4, 1850). He was the great-great-great-grandson of Maryland pioneer Thomas Davis, and the great-great-great-great-grandson of Maryland politician and justice Colonel Nicholas Gassaway, both of whom were of Welsh ancestry and emigrated to Maryland in the mid 17th century.

Stage coaches stopped at Woodstock five days a week en route to Washington, D.C., and Davis later often recalled one of his earliest memories: witnessing the groundbreaking of the country&#x27;s first railroad on July 4, 1828, from atop his father&#x27;s shoulders in Baltimore.

Davis had three brothers and a sister. His father&#x27;s business prospered until he won a contract to grade a section of road between Baltimore and Frederick, Maryland, which caused heavy losses. Creditors caused even the family&#x27;s horses and carriages to be sold, which proved devastating to Caleb Davis&#x27;s health.

==Early career==

When his family&#x27;s finances collapsed, Davis, then 15 years old, abandoned his education and took a job carrying water for workmen at a nearby quarry and then became caretaker of &quot;Waverly,&quot; a nearby farm owned by Governor Howard. When Davis was 20, the B&amp;O completed track from Frederick to Cumberland, and needed men to run the trains and handle cargo. Thus, Davis went to work for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a brakeman. His hard work and enthusiasm drew the attention of the railroad&#x27;s president, Thomas Swann, who promoted him to freight conductor and then passenger conductor. Davis met many statesmen, including Senators Henry Clay of Kentucky (Davis came to admire him and received invitations to visit at his home), Thomas H. Benton of Missouri, Lewis Cass of Michigan, Benjamin Wade and Thomas Corwin of Ohio, and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, all of whom embarked the B&amp;O train in Cumberland to reach Washington, D.C. (or disembarked on the reverse route). Davis also often stayed at a hotel in Washington between trips and conversed with other notables, including Senators William C. Rives of Virginia, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.
When the B&amp;O finally completed track to Wheeling on the navigable Ohio River, Davis was put in charge of the Piedmont station. It was a crucial station because it was at the foot of a mountain, where trains traveling eastward added engines to surmount the slope. Until the railroad completed a house for him (so that his new wife could join him), Davis lived in a box car and also came to admire the natural landscape of the Allegheny Mountains. After four years, his brother Thomas joined him, and they established a store, often trading farm products for manufactured goods such as jeans, shoes, calico and sugar. In 1858, Davis resigned his railroad job to concentrate on the firm, Henry G. Davis &amp; Company.

Davis also explored the Alleghenies, particularly the area drained by the Potomac River to the east and the Cheat River on the western side of the eastern continental divide. He purchased land rich in timber or coal (often for $1 an acre). He soon built sawmills to process the lumber and extended branch railroads to new coal mines, and also invested in banking in Piedmont.

When the Civil War began, even the B&amp;O&#x27;s president, John Work Garrett, initially sympathized with the Southern cause. However, the B&amp;O was crucial for the Union armies. Davis favored the Union and also admired the new President, Abraham Lincoln. When Confederate raiders attacked the B&amp;O and destroyed track and bridges, part of Davis&#x27; job was to restore service and keep the supplies moving. Many in western Virginia likewise favored the Union, met in two Wheeling Conventions, and adopted a statehood referendum and constitution that eventually led to West Virginia becoming the 35th state. In 1865, Davis would be elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates as one of Hampshire County&#x27;s representatives.

==Personal life==

On February 22, 1853, in Frederick County, Maryland. Davis married Katherine Ann Salome &quot;Kate&quot; Bantz. Henry and Katherine had eight children, three of whom died in infancy. One of those three is unidentified; the remaining seven were:
*(1) - Mary Louise &quot;Hallie&quot; Davis (December 19, 1853 – March 1, 1933) - She married industrialist and politician Stephen Benton Elkins (September 26, 1841 – January 4, 1911) on April 14, 1875, in Baltimore; her married name was Hallie Davis Elkins. Hallie Davis was Stephen Elkins&#x27;s second wife; his first was Sarah Simms &quot;Sallie&quot; Jacobs (1845 – 1872), whom he had married in 1866 and with whom he had two children. His marriage with Hallie Davis produced five children. Elkins, a Republican, would become his father-in-law&#x27;s protégé and business partner and die 22 years before his wife and five years before her father.
*(2) - Kate Bantz Davis (December 1, 1856 – January 21, 1903)
*(3) - Anderson Cord Davis (1859 - December 1862)
*(4) - Ada Kate Davis (January 14, 1862 - September 1863)
*(5) - Grace Thomas Davis (October 19, 1869 – January 18, 1931) (a.k.a. Gracie Davis)
*(6) - Henry Gassaway Davis Jr. (May 10, 1871 – April 24, 1896) (a.k.a. Harry Davis), lost at sea off the Atlantic coast of South Africa
*(7) - John Thomas Davis (March 31, 1874 – June 27, 1935)

===Political and commercial life===
In 1865 Davis was elected a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. The following year, he founded the Potomac and Piedmont Coal and Railway Company with the intent of furnishing transportation to his coal mining and timbering interests. The company was given the right to construct railroad grades in Mineral, Grant, Tucker and Randolph counties. He became a state senator in 1869. In 1870, he was elected to the United States Senate, serving two terms, with his service ending in 1883.

Following his service in the Senate, Davis retired to Elkins, West Virginia, where he resumed banking and coal mining. Davis&#x27;s company now controlled , employed 1,600 men of sixteen nationalities, operated two power plants, and worked over 1,000 coke ovens and 9 mines within one mile (1.6 km) of the central office at Coketon in Tucker County. By 1892, the Davis Coal and Coke Company, a partnership between Davis and his son-in-law, Senator Stephen Benton Elkins, was among the largest coal companies in the world.

Davis represented the U.S. at the Pan-American Conferences of 1889 and 1901.

====Candidate for Vice President====
In 1904, Davis became the Democratic nominee for vice president on a ticket with Alton B. Parker. They lost to the Republican ticket of Theodore Roosevelt and Charles W. Fairbanks by a wide margin. At the age of 80, Davis was and remains the oldest person to be nominated for vice president on a major party ticket. He was chosen primarily because of his ability to provide much-needed funds to the campaign.

===Later years===
Davis in his last years acted as chairman of the permanent Pan American Railway Committee (1901–1916) and also donated land to build Davis and Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia. He died in Washington, D.C., on March 11, 1916, at the age of 92. He was interred in the Maplewood Cemetery in Elkins. A bronze equestrian statue of Davis was erected in 1927, at Sycamore Street and Randolph Avenue in Elkins, with an identical twin in Davis Park in downtown Charleston, West Virginia.

<text>Arthur Sewall (November 25, 1835 – September 5, 1900) was an American shipbuilder from Maine, best known as the Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1896, running mate to William Jennings Bryan. From 1888 to 1896, he served as a member of the Democratic National Committee and unsuccessfully ran for Maine&#x27;s Senate seat against Eugene Hale. The only elective offices Sewall held were as councilman and alderman in the town of Bath, Maine.

==Life==
On November 25, 1835, Arthur Sewall was born to William and Rachel Sewall in Bath, Maine. In 1892 Sewall launched the &quot;Roanoke&quot;, which at the time was the world&#x27;s largest wooden ship.

Following the death of his father, he and his brother led their successful and wealthy shipbuilding business, and he took complete control following his brother&#x27;s death in 1879. He served as President of the Maine Central railroad from 1884 to 1893 and also served as President of the Bath National Bank.

He attended every Democratic National Convention between 1872 and 1900 with the exception of 1876, though he was a strong admirer of the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for president that year, Samuel Tilden, and believed from then on that the election was stolen from Tilden in 1876. He was also defeated in a race for the U.S. Senate in 1893.

In June 1895, he came out in support of free silver, and he took third place on the first ballot for vice president at the 1896 Democratic National Convention behind Representative Joseph C. Sibley and Publisher John R. McLean and after initially losing delegates on the second ballot rebounded and took the majority on the fifth ballot before being nominated by acclamation. His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. He was in favor of high tariffs and almost imperialistic in foreign policy, so he and Bryan agreed largely only on the monetary question. Arthur Sewall was also one of the few politicians who was an adherent of Swedenborgiansm, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party&#x27;s national committee. Sewall was Bryan&#x27;s running mate for the first of Bryan&#x27;s three times as the Democratic presidential nominee.

On September 5, 1900, Sewall died in Small Point, Maine, from apoplexy. He is interred in Oak Grove Cemetery in Bath, Maine. At the time of his death, he was worth $5,000,000 ($167,350,000 in 2022 dollars).

==Legacy==

Sewall&#x27;s grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican.

In 2008, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain&#x27;s selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked &quot;the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s No. 2 in 1896.&quot;

<text>Barry Greenstein (born December 30, 1954, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American professional poker player and former mathematics postgraduate student. He has won a number of major events, including three at the World Series of Poker and two on the World Poker Tour. Greenstein donates part of his profit from tournament winnings to charities, primarily Children Incorporated, earning him the nickname &quot;the Robin Hood of poker&quot;. He was elected into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Personal life==
After graduating from Bogan High School, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He studied for a PhD in mathematics without ever defending his completed dissertation.

According to his book, &quot;Ace on the River&quot;, Greenstein was doing well playing poker, but figured a more conventional job would improve his chances of adopting his stepchildren, so he went to work for the new startup company Symantec, where he worked on their first product Q&amp;A. He left the company in 1991 at age 36.

Greenstein has two children and four stepchildren, and he resides in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. His stepson, Joe Sebok, with whom he started PokerRoad—a poker strategy and entertainment website—also played professionally for a few years.

==Poker career==
Greenstein has appeared in each of the first three series of Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament and all seven seasons of the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;. He has also appeared in the first three seasons of the late night series &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; on NBC. Greenstein has also won two World Poker Tour (WPT) titles: the Fifth Annual Jack Binion World Poker Open ($1,278,370), and 2006 WPT Invitational at the Commerce Casino ($100,000). He has also won two other WPT titles in special events: WPT Father and Sons Tournament, 2006 World Poker Finals; and WPT Poker by the Book: Chapter 2. As of 2008, he began donating his net winnings to charity. At the 2008 World Series of Poker (WSOP), Greenstein cashed in six events, including the H.O.R.S.E. $50,000 event, for a total of $768,461. He also finished second in the 2008 WSOP Player of the Year standings, behind Erick Lindgren. In 2011, Greenstein cashed five times at the World Series of Poker, including a 3rd place in the $10,000 Limit Hold&#x27;em Championship for $169,512 and a 15th place in the $50,000 Player&#x27;s Championship.

In 2005, Greenstein wrote a book titled &quot;Ace on the River&quot;. Tuan Le, a WPT Season 3 champion, claims that book showed him how to succeed on the poker circuit. Greenstein is known for giving away a free copy of his book to the player who eliminates him in a tournament, including his autograph and details of the hand. Greenstein taught former girlfriend Mimi Tran how to play poker in exchange for her teaching him how to speak Vietnamese. He also played online at PokerStars, under the alias &quot;barryg1&quot; and was a member of the cardroom&#x27;s &quot;Team PokerStars&quot;.

He accepted a bet of $10,000 from 2+2 Poker Forums to say &quot;lol donkaments&quot; on an episode of &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;, which he did after winning a hand against professional poker player Erick Lindgren. After the initial $10,000, he also received a further $45,000 in donations from other charitable poker players who were amused by the bet.

===World Series of Poker bracelets===
As of 2023, his total live tournament winnings exceed $8,500,000. His 102 WSOP cashes account for $3,148,034 of those winnings.

== Philanthropy ==

Greenstein often uses his poker winnings to further his philanthropic and charitable interests, earning him the &quot;Robin Hood of Poker&quot; nickname. After winning $770,000 at Larry Flynt&#x27;s $1 million Seven-Card Stud event in 2003, he donated $440,000 to Children Incorporated – a gift of $1,000 to each of the charity&#x27;s 440 employees. In 2006, Greenstein announced that he would be donating net earnings from tournaments to charity. &quot;Until now, I was donating the pay-off each time I cashed but I can&#x27;t afford to continue doing that. I didn&#x27;t anticipate the growth and expense of tournament poker,&quot; he said.

<text>Épinal (; ; ) is a commune in northeastern France and the prefecture of the Vosges department.

==Geography==
The commune has a land area of . It is situated on the river Moselle, south of Nancy. Épinal station has rail connections to Paris, Remiremont, Strasbourg, Belfort and Nancy.

== History ==
The mythical founding date of Épinal is said to be 983 since celebrations took place for the &quot;Millennium&quot; in June 1983. This date was chosen for political reasons to mark a &quot;starting point&quot; following the election of Philippe Séguin as mayor in March 1983.

In 1444, the town of Épinal was still part of the domain of the bishops of Metz. In September, representatives of the town took advantage of King Charles VII&#x27;s passage through Nancy to offer him the submission of the town and to ask for his protection in return. The act of submission of Épinal is dated September 7, 1444. The king promised never to alienate the city; however, Louis XI handed over the town to the Marshal of Burgundy in 1465. Eventually, Épinal came under the guardianship of the Duke of Lorraine.

In 1790, the Constituent Assembly requested the departmental assembly of Vosges to choose between Mirecourt and Épinal as the capital of the department. The departmental assembly convened in Épinal on June 1 and, with three hundred and eleven votes against one hundred and twenty-seven, chose the city of Épinal. Mirecourt became a sub-prefecture.

During World War II, in January 1944, the Stalag 315 prisoner-of-war camp was relocated from the German-occupied Netherlands to Épinal, and it housed Indian POWs. At least 40 POWs were killed and 80 were wounded after the camp was hit during a bombing of the town in May 1944.

==Population==

In 2018, 32,223 people lived in the town proper, while its functional area had a population of 119,955.

==Main sights==
The old town centre features the Place des Vosges, the Chapitre district, Saint-Maurice&#x27;s Basilica, medieval castle remains and the Roman House (11th and 13th centuries). It is also known for its parks and gardens, as well as a large communal forest with arboretum (the Arboretum de la Forêt d&#x27;Épinal).

There are major fortifications, extended and maintained until the early 20th century. There is a legend, among the populace of Épinal, that Napoleon&#x27;s ghost strolls the wall ramparts on 9 September of each year at 05:00. It was on this day and at this time that, in 1811, Napoleon gave his first and last oration to the city of Épinal, wherein he addressed the challenges posed by northern expansion.

<text>Segura ( ; ; , or ) is a medium-sized river in southeastern Spain. It has its source in the Sierra de Segura.

==Course==
The 325-km (202 mi) long river begins at Santiago Pontones (province of Jaén), passes Calasparra, Cieza, Blanca, Murcia, Beniaján (Region of Murcia), Orihuela, Rojales, and flows into the Mediterranean Sea near Guardamar del Segura in the province of Alicante. Some of its tributaries are the Mundo (which starts near Riópar), the Alhárabe (which starts in Moratalla), the Mula, and the Guadalentín.

The alluvial plain is called the &quot;Vega del Segura&quot; and is a very productive agricultural region growing a wide variety of fruit, vegetables, and flowers. The &quot;Vegas&quot; are divided into three areas: &quot;Alta&quot;, &quot;Media&quot;, and &quot;Baja&quot; (upper, medium, and lower).

=== Tributaries ===
The Segura&#x27;s main tributaries are:
===Recovery===

By the 1990s, the Segura had become one of the most polluted rivers in Europe, due to the canning industry and urban and agricultural residues originating in the densely populated area in the medium and lower areas of the basin. This fact combined with low or extreme low flows in the same areas –the agricultural use of water and summer drought could reduce the mean discharge to just around 2 to 3 m/s in Murcia city– made it more difficult to dilute pollutants.

Public outcry peaked in 2001, with a demonstration gathering 40,000 people. A comprehensive action plan followed, the Segura River Project, developed by the Murcia Government&#x27;s Regional Water Department, in partnership with the Segura River Authority (CHS) and town councils in the region, to restore the health of the Segura River and to supply reclaimed water to the booming agriculture industry. Between 2001 and 2010, 100 water treatment plants and 350 kilometres of wastewater collection systems were built. In addition, a wastewater reclamation levy was established to finance the operation, maintenance and monitoring of these systems, applying the principle &quot;the polluter pays&quot;.

By 2003, the quality of the Segura&#x27;s water started improving. Since 2010, pollution has been unnoticeable, leading to the recovery of fauna and flora including increased otter population in parts of the river they had once abandoned. Birds now rest at two recovered wetland areas recognised by the Ramsar Convention, during their migration between Europe and Africa. In addition, around 110 million m of reclaimed water is reused annually for agriculture in the region.

With the river coming back to life, by 2013, otters and eels –both species particularly sensitive to water pollutants– had repopulated large tracts of the river where they had been absent for decades.

As of 2015, the Segura River Project is a finalist for the 2016 European Riverprize Awards, organized by the International River Foundation. This recognizes the fact that the Segura went from being one of the most polluted major rivers in Europe to being the Spanish river with the lowest average pollution (considering the average of all tracts of the river) in the span of just one decade.

===Average discharge===

==Floods==
The Segura is usually in a state of semi-permanent drought, however, now and then, it does occasionally flood as the consequence of the torrential rains (cold drop), which typically take place once every 6–9 years approximately, always in Autumn and Spring.

The Guadalentín river, a tributary of the Segura, is the wildest European river.

In the twentieth century significant flooding occurred in 1946, 1948, 1973, 1982, 1987 and 1989. Since 1990 the lower reaches of the river have been canalized, removing meanders and hence improving the evacuation of flood waters. The new canal was put to the test in September 1997, in October 2000, in December 2016 and September 2019, when heavy rainfall resulted in significant runoff.

<text>John Frank Wilson (December 11, 1941 – October 4, 1991) was an American singer, the lead vocalist of J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. Born in Lufkin, Texas, Wilson was inducted into the West Texas Music Hall Of Fame.

==Career==
Wilson joined the Cavaliers after his discharge from Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, in 1962.

The Cavaliers&#x27; first chart hit was &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a song written by Wayne Cochran, who had based the song on a car accident in Barnesville, Georgia, near where he lived.

The song, while only garnering minor success for Wayne Cochran and the C.C. Riders, found major success for the Cavaliers. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; became a hit in June 1964, it reached the top 10 in October of that year, eventually reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

In October 1964, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Wilson had himself been involved in an auto accident near Lima, Ohio, in which his 27-year-old record producer, Sonley Roush, was killed, and Wilson was seriously injured.

While J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers recorded many more songs, and &quot;Last Kiss&quot; was subsequently covered successfully by Wednesday and Pearl Jam, the band charted with only one other song, &quot;Hey, Little One&quot;, which reached number 85.

Wilson, with or without the Cavaliers, continued to release records until 1978. He started working offshore oilfield in late 1970s and 1980s in the Gulf of Mexico.

Wilson died on October 4, 1991, at the age of 49, from alcoholism and complications from diabetes.

<text>The Galaksija (; , meaning &quot;Galaxy&quot;) was a build-it-yourself computer designed by Voja Antonić. It was featured in the special edition &quot;Računari u vašoj kući&quot; (&quot;Computers in your home&quot;, written by Dejan Ristanović) of a popular eponymous science magazine, published late December 1983 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Kits were available but not required as it could be built entirely out of standard off-the-shelf parts. It was later also available in complete form.

== History ==
In the early eighties, restrictions in SFR Yugoslavia prevented importing computers into the country. At the same time, even the cheapest computers available in the West were nearing average monthly salaries. This meant that only a relative minority of people owned one — mostly a ZX Spectrum or a Commodore 64, though most Yugoslavs were only familiar with a programmable calculator.

According to his own words, some time in 1983, Voja Antonić, while vacationing in Hotel Teuta in Risan, was reading the application handbook for the RCA CDP1802 CPU and stumbled upon CPU-assisted video generation. Since the CDP1802 was very primitive, he decided that a Zilog Z80 processor could perform the task as well.

Before he returned home to Belgrade, he already had the conceptual diagrams of a computer that used software to generate a video picture. Although using software as opposed to hardware would significantly reduce his design&#x27;s performance, it also simplified the hardware and reduced its cost.

His next step was to find a magazine to publish the diagrams in. The obvious choice was SAM Magazine published in Zagreb, but due to prior bad experiences he decided to publish elsewhere. Near the same time that Antonić made his discovery, Dejan Ristanović, a computer programmer and journalist was entrusted with preparing a special edition of the &quot;Galaksija&quot; magazine that would be focused on home computers. After Ristanović and Antonić met, they decided to collaborate and publish the computer&#x27;s diagram in a special issue of the magazine entitled &quot;Računari u vašoj kući&quot; (&quot;Computers in your home&quot;). It was released late December 1983. The name of the magazine (&quot;Galaksija&quot;) would become twinned with the name of the computer.

Antonić and Ristanović guesstimated that around a thousand people would try to build the computer by themselves, given that the magazine&#x27;s circulation was 30,000. Some 8,000 people wound up ordering the build-it-yourself kits from Antonić. This number may in reality be greater if people who did not purchase any kits (including PCB and ROMs) were accounted for.

Components were provided by various manufacturers and suppliers:
* MIPRO and Elektronika from Buje, together with the Institute for Electronics and Vacuum Technology (Serbian: &quot;Institut za elektroniku i vakuumsku tehniku&quot;) delivered PCBs, keyboards and masks
* Mikrotehnika from Graz sent integrated circuits
* Voja Antonić personally programmed all EPROMs
* Galaksija collected requisition forms and organized deliveries

Later, the Institute for School Books and Teaching Aids (Serbian: &quot;Zavod za udžbenike i nastavna sredstva&quot;), together with Elektronika Inženjering, started mass commercial production of Galaksija computers, mainly to be delivered to schools.

== Technical specifications ==
* CPU: Zilog Z80A 3.072 MHz
* ROM &quot;A&quot; or &quot;1&quot; – 4 KB (2732 EPROM) contains bootstrap, core control and Galaksija BASIC interpreter code
* ROM &quot;B&quot; or &quot;2&quot; – 4 KB (&quot;optional&quot;, also 2732 EPROM) – additional Galaksija BASIC commands, assembler, machine code monitor, etc.
* Character ROM – 2 KB (2716 EPROM) contains character definitions, characters are 8×13 pixels, the block graphics were vertically divided in a 4:5:4 scheme, and horizontally in a 4:4 scheme.
* RAM: 2 to 6 KB of 6116 static RAM in base model, expandable to 54 KB
* Text mode 32 x 16 characters, monochrome
* Pseudographics: 2×3 dot matrix combinations in graphic character subset – 64 distinct patterns in total
* Sound: None according to specifications, but tape interface was occasionally used as audio output port – like the &quot;EAR&quot; port on ZX Spectrum can be used both as audio and cassette tape interface. See cassette port for details.
* Storage media: cassette tape, recording at 280 bit/s rate
* I/O ports: 44-pin edge connector with Z80 Bus, tape (DIN connector), monochrome video out (PAL timings, DIN connector), and UHF TV out (RCA connector)

== BASIC ROMs ==
Galaksija BASIC is a BASIC interpreter originally partly based on code taken from TRS-80 Level 1 BASIC, which the creator believed to have been a Microsoft BASIC. However, after extensive modifications to include video generation code (as the CPU was a major participant to reduce the cost of hardware) and improve the programming language, what remained from the original is said to be mainly flow-control and floating point code. It was fully contained in 4 KB ROM &quot;A&quot; or &quot;1&quot;. Additional ROM &quot;B&quot; or &quot;2&quot; provided more Galaksija BASIC commands, assembler, monitor, etc.

=== ROM &quot;A&quot; ===
The chip labeled as &quot;A&quot; by the creator of Galaksija, Voja Antonić was commonly referred to as &quot;ROM 1&quot; or just &quot;ROM&quot;. ROM &quot;A&quot; contained bootstrap code of Galaksija, its control code (rudimentary operating system), video generation code (as Galaksija did not have advanced video subsystem its Z80 CPU was responsible even for generating video signal) and Galaksija BASIC.

Fitting all this functionality in 4 KB of 2732 EPROM required a lot of effort and some sacrifices. For example, some message text areas were also used actual code (e.g. &quot;READY&quot; message) and the number of error messages was reduced to only three (&quot;WHAT?&quot;, &quot;HOW?&quot; and &quot;SORRY&quot;).

=== ROM &quot;B&quot; ===
ROM &quot;B&quot; of the Galaksija is a 2732 EPROM chip that contains extensions to the original Galaksija BASIC available in base ROM (&quot;A&quot;). It was labeled as &quot;B&quot; by the creator of the Galaksija, Voja Antonić, but was commonly referred to as &quot;ROM 2&quot;.

ROM &quot;B&quot; contained added Galaksija BASIC commands and functions (mostly trigonometric) as well as a Z80 assembler and a machine code monitor. This ROM was not required and was an optional upgrade. Although planned on the mainboard, the content of ROM &quot;B&quot; was not automatically initialized during booting. Instead, users had to execute a Galaksija BASIC command to run a machine code program from ROM &quot;B&quot; before they can gain additional features. This also meant that even Galaksijas with ROM &quot;B&quot; plugged in can behave entirely as base models.

== Character ROM ==

Character ROM of home computer Galaksija is a 2716 EPROM chip that contains graphical definitions of Galaksija&#x27;s character set. It had no special name and was labeled &quot;2716&quot; after the type of 2 KB EPROM needed.

The character encoding is based on ASCII, but has several modifications:
* There are no lowercase characters (like ASCII-1963)
* Codepoints 91 to 94 (0x5B to 0x5E) represent the Serbian characters Č, Ć, Ž and Š, respectively. The letter &quot;Đ&quot; is not present in the original version, so was commonly substituted with the digraph &quot;DJ&quot;.
* The 64 codepoints from 128 to 191 (0x80 to 0xBF) are the 64 distinct 2×3 matrix blocks.
* Codepoints 64 (0x40) and 39 (0x27) are used for two-halves of the logo of one of two companies: Voja Antonić&#x27;s MIPRO (whose logo is a glider from Conway&#x27;s Game of Life) or Elektronika Inženjering (whose logo is a stylized arrow). This logo is displayed in the &quot;READY&quot; prompt. EPROMs programmed by Antonić at &quot;Računari u vašoj kući&quot; offices use the MIPRO logo, while EPROMs produced at a factory use the Elektronika inženjering logo.

Each character is represented as a 8×16 matrix of pixels. In this ROM, 8-pixel rows of each character are represented as 8 bits of one byte.


== &quot;Cassette&quot; port ==
Galaksija used cassette tape as secondary storage. It featured a 5-pin DIN connector used to connect the computer to a cassette tape recorder. Tape interface circuitry was rudimentary – other than few elements controlling the levels it was essentially one-bit digital equivalent to the one in the ZX Spectrum. The input signal was routed to the integrated circuit otherwise responsible for keyboard, so the CPU would &quot;see&quot; the input signal as a series of very fast key presses of varying lengths and gaps between them.

It is normally stated that original Galaksija does not have any dedicated (separate) audio ports and most of the programs were written as silent. It was, however, possible to utilize the cassette tape port as an audio output as well like it is done in ZX Spectrum (its &quot;EAR&quot; connector). The only technical difference between ZX Spectrum and Galaksija in regards to existence of audio is that ZX Spectrum has a built-in beeper, while Galaksija&#x27;s plans do not include any kind of a speaker.

== Software sharing via radio ==
In Autumn 1983, Računari&#x27;s editor contacted Zoran Modli, the DJ of Radio Belgrade 202&#x27;s Ventilator 202 program, asking him to broadcast software as part of the show. As the Galaksija stored software on data cassette, Modli was able to alert listeners about an upcoming data broadcast, broadcast the data as sound over the regular FM wave and listeners were able to record the data broadcast using home cassette decks and load the software on the Galaksija via the data cassette drive. Ventilator 202 became a hub of software sharing, with home programmers editing previously broadcast software and sending in the edits for future rebroadcast. Over three years Ventilator 202 broadcast 150 pieces of software for the Galaksija, the Spectrum and Commodore 64, including a digital magazine, named Hack News. Modli notes that while much of the software was written for the Ventilator 202 audience by Yugoslavian authors, plenty of those same authors were also cracking, pirating and sharing commercial software via the show.

== Design ==
To simplify &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; building and reduce cost, the printed circuit board was designed as single-layer (one-side) board. This resulted in a relatively complicated design requiring many component-side connections to be made using wire links.

Galaksija&#x27;s case was not pre-built. Instead, the guide suggested it to be built out of the printed circuit board material (such as Pertinax) also used for the mainboard. Thus, the top, sides and reinforcements were soldered together to form the &quot;lid&quot;. Acrylic glass was recommended for the underside. The guide included instructions on cleaning, painting and even decorating the assembled case. The name &quot;GALAKSIJA&quot; and decorative border were to be added using Letraset transfer letter sheets after the first (white) coat of paint but before the second coat of final colour. After the paint dried, transferred decorations were supposed to be scratched off, exposing underlying white paint.

The keyboard is laid out such that keys have their own memory-mapped addresses that, in most cases, follow the same order as ASCII code of the letter on the key. This saved the ROM space by reducing lookup tables but significantly increased the complexity of single-layer keyboard PCB such that it alone required 35 wire links.

<text>A nocebo effect is said to occur when a patient&#x27;s expectations for a treatment cause the treatment to have a worse effect than it otherwise would have. For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a medication, they can experience that effect even if the &quot;medication&quot; is actually an inert substance. The complementary concept, the &quot;placebo&quot; effect, is said to occur when expectations improve an outcome. 

More generally, the nocebo effect is falling ill simply by consciously or subconsciously anticipating a harmful event. This definition includes anticipated events &quot;other&quot; than medical treatment. It has been applied to Havana Syndrome, where purported victims were anticipating attacks by foreign adversaries. This definition also applies to cases of electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably but can induce measurable changes in the body. One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects, including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction, and severe hypotension.

==Etymology and usage==
Walter Kennedy coined the term &quot;nocebo&quot; (Latin , &quot;I shall harm&quot;, from , &quot;I harm&quot;) in 1961 to denote the counterpart of &quot;placebo&quot; (Latin , &quot;I shall please&quot;, from , &quot;I please&quot;), a substance that may produce a beneficial, healthful, pleasant, or desirable effect. Kennedy emphasized that his use of the term &quot;nocebo&quot; refers strictly to a subject-centered response, a quality &quot;inherent in the patient rather than in the remedy&quot;. That is, he rejected the use of the term for pharmacologically induced negative side effects such as the ringing in the ears caused by quinine. That is not to say that the patient&#x27;s psychologically induced response may not include physiological effects. For example, an expectation of pain may induce anxiety, which in turn causes the release of cholecystokinin, which facilitates pain transmission.

==Response==
In the narrowest sense, a nocebo response occurs when a drug-trial subject&#x27;s symptoms are worsened by the administration of an inert, sham, or dummy (simulator) treatment, called a placebo. Placebos contain no chemicals (or any other agents) that could &quot;cause&quot; any of the observed worsening in the subject&#x27;s symptoms, so any change for the worse must be due to some subjective factor. Adverse expectations can also cause anesthetic medications&#x27; analgesic effects to disappear.

The worsening of the subject&#x27;s symptoms or reduction of beneficial effects is a direct consequence of their exposure to the placebo, but the placebo has not chemically generated those symptoms. Because this generation of symptoms entails a complex of &quot;subject-internal&quot; activities, we can never speak in the strictest sense in terms of simulator-centered &quot;nocebo effects&quot;, but only in terms of subject-centered &quot;nocebo responses&quot;. Some observers attribute nocebo responses (or placebo responses) to a subject&#x27;s gullibility, but there is no evidence that someone who manifests a nocebo/placebo response to one treatment will manifest a nocebo/placebo response to any other treatment; i.e., there is no fixed nocebo/placebo-responding trait or propensity.

McGlashan, Evans &amp; Orne found no evidence in 1969 of what they termed a &quot;placebo personality&quot;. In 1954, Lasagna, Mosteller, von Felsinger, and Beecher found in a carefully designed study that there was no way that any observer could determine, by testing or by interview, which subjects would manifest placebo reactions and which would not. Experiments have shown that no relationship exists between an person&#x27;s measured hypnotic susceptibility and their manifestation of nocebo or placebo responses.

Based on a biosemiotic model (2022), Goli explains how harm and/or healing expectations lead to a multimodal image and form transient allostatic or homeostatic interoceptive feelings, demonstrating how repetitive experiences of a potential body induce epigenetic changes and form new attractors, such as nocebos and placeboes, in the actual body.

==Effects==

===Side effects of drugs===
It has been shown that, due to the nocebo effect, warning patients about drugs&#x27; side effects can contribute to the causation of such effects, whether the drug is real or not. This effect has been observed in clinical trials: according to a 2013 review, the dropout rate among placebo-treated patients in a meta-analysis of 41 clinical trials of Parkinson&#x27;s disease treatments was 8.8%. A 2013 review found that nearly 1 out of 20 patients receiving a placebo in clinical trials for depression dropped out due to adverse events, which were believed to have been caused by the nocebo effect.

In January 2022, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that nocebo responses accounted for 72% of adverse effects after the first COVID-19 vaccine dose and 52% after the second dose.

Many studies show that the formation of nocebo responses are influenced by inappropriate health education, media work, and other discourse makers who induce health anxiety and negative expectations.

Researchers studying the side effects of statins in UK determined that a large proportion of reported side effects were related not to any pharmacological cause but to the nocebo effect. In the UK, publicity in 2013 about the apparent side effects caused hundreds of thousands of patients to stop taking statins, leading to an estimated 2,000 additional cardiovascular events in the subsequent years.

===Electromagnetic hypersensitivity===
Evidence suggests that the symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity are caused by the nocebo effect.

===Pain===
Verbal suggestion can cause hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) and allodynia (perception of a tactile stimulus as painful) as a result of the nocebo effect. Nocebo hyperalgesia is believed to involve the activation of cholecystokinin receptors.

==Ambiguity of medical usage==
Stewart-Williams and Podd argue that using the contrasting terms &quot;placebo&quot; and &quot;nocebo&quot; for inert agents that produce pleasant, health-improving, or desirable outcomes and unpleasant, health-diminishing, or undesirable outcomes (respectively) is extremely counterproductive. For example, precisely the same inert agents can produce analgesia and hyperalgesia, the first of which, on this definition, would be a placebo, and the second a nocebo.

A second problem is that the same effect, such as immunosuppression, may be desirable for a subject with an autoimmune disorder, but undesirable for most other subjects. Thus, in the first case, the effect would be a placebo, and in the second a nocebo. A third problem is that the prescriber does not know whether the relevant subjects consider the effects they experience desirable or undesirable until some time after the drugs have been administered. A fourth is that the same phenomena are generated in all the subjects, and generated by the same drug, which is acting in all of the subjects through the same mechanism. Yet because the phenomena in question have been subjectively considered desirable to one group but not the other, the phenomena are now being labeled in two mutually exclusive ways (i.e., placebo and nocebo), giving the false impression that the drug in question has produced two different phenomena.

==Ambiguity of anthropological usage==
Some people maintain that belief can kill (e.g., voodoo death: Cannon in 1942 describes a number of instances from a variety of different cultures) and or heal (e.g., faith healing). A self-willed death (due to voodoo hex, evil eye, pointing the bone procedure, etc.) is an extreme form of a culture-specific syndrome or mass psychogenic illness that produces a particular form of psychosomatic or psychophysiological disorder resulting in psychogenic death. Rubel in 1964 spoke of &quot;culture-bound&quot; syndromes, those &quot;from which members of a particular group claim to suffer and for which their culture provides an etiology, diagnosis, preventive measures, and regimens of healing&quot;.

Certain anthropologists, such as Robert Hahn and Arthur Kleinman, have extended the placebo/nocebo distinction into this realm to allow a distinction to be made between rituals, such as faith healing, performed to heal, cure, or bring benefit (placebo rituals) and others, such as &quot;pointing the bone&quot;, performed to kill, injure or bring harm (nocebo rituals). As the meaning of the two interrelated and opposing terms has extended, we now find anthropologists speaking, in various contexts, of nocebo or placebo (harmful or helpful) rituals:
* that might entail nocebo or placebo (unpleasant or pleasant) procedures;
* about which subjects might have nocebo or placebo (harmful or beneficial) beliefs;
* that are delivered by operators that might have nocebo or placebo (pathogenic, disease-generating or salutogenic, health-promoting) expectations;
* that are delivered to subjects that might have nocebo or placebo (negative, fearful, despairing or positive, hopeful, confident) expectations about the ritual;
* that are delivered by operators who might have nocebo or placebo (malevolent or benevolent) intentions, in the hope that the rituals will generate nocebo or placebo (lethal, injurious, harmful or restorative, curative, healthy) outcomes; and, that all of this depends upon the operator&#x27;s overall beliefs in the nocebo ritual&#x27;s harmful nature or the placebo ritual&#x27;s beneficial nature.

Yet it may become even more terminologically complex, for as Hahn and Kleinman indicate, there can also be cases of paradoxical nocebo outcomes from placebo rituals and placebo outcomes from nocebo rituals (see also unintended consequences). In 1973, writing from his extensive experience of treating cancer (including more than 1,000 melanoma cases) at Sydney Hospital, Milton warned of the impact of the delivery of a prognosis, and how many of his patients, upon receiving their prognosis, gave up hope and died a premature death: &quot;there is a small group of patients in whom the realization of impending death is a blow so terrible that they are quite unable to adjust to it, and they die rapidly before the malignancy seems to have developed enough to cause death. This problem of self-willed death is in some ways analogous to the death produced in primitive peoples by witchcraft (&#x27;pointing the bone&#x27;)&quot;.

==Ethics==
Some researchers have pointed out that the harm caused by communicating with patients about potential treatment adverse events raises an ethical issue. To respect their autonomy, one must inform a patient about harms a treatment may cause. Yet the way in which potential harms are communicated could cause additional harm, which may violate the ethical principle of non-maleficence. It is possible that nocebo effects can be reduced while respecting autonomy using different models of informed consent, including the use of a framing effect and the authorized concealment.

<text>William Pierson (July 17, 1926 – August 27, 2004) was an American television, motion picture and stage actor, best known for his raspy voice and his role as Marko the Mailman in the 1953 film &quot;Stalag 17&quot; as well as a recurring role as Dean Travers on the 1970s ABC-TV series &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

==Biography==

===Life and career===
Pierson, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York originally played the role of Marko in the original Broadway production of &quot;Stalag 17&quot;, and was tapped by director Billy Wilder for the role in the 1953 motion picture production. Other Broadway appearances included in &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, &quot;Make Mine Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot;, and in a national touring company of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Pierson, who was well recognized by his distinctive, raspy delivery, also appeared in the Off Broadway production &quot;Smile, Smile, Smile&quot;. After Wilder brought him to Hollywood, he appeared in films such as &quot;Operation Madball&quot; and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane (1977)&quot;.

Pierson enjoyed a busy career in television and film, a career which spanned four decades from the 1950s through the 1980s, which included appearances on such TV shows such as &quot;Studio One&quot; and &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;All In The Family&quot;, &quot;One Day At A Time&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;The Facts Of Life&quot; in addition to his role as Dean Travers on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

Pierson died from respiratory failure in Newton, New Jersey. He had been residing for years at the Valley View Care Center in Newton due to declining health. He was survived by two brothers, Jefferson Pierson of New Jersey and Howard Pierson of Florida.

By 1968 Baunsgaard&#x27;s party had been a frequent coalition partner of the Social Democrats for the last 15 years. However, after the 1968 elections, he abandoned the Social Democrats and formed a centre-right coalition with the Conservative Party and the Liberal &quot;Venstre&quot;. The three parties held a clear majority of seats in the parliament. In spite of this, they utterly failed to tackle the growing problems of the welfare state and rein in public spending. As a result, taxation skyrocketed. In the social sphere the government was one of the most radical thus far seen in Denmark, abolishing censorship of pornography and legalising abortion. However, in doing so they alienated sufficient numbers of core supporters to lose the 1971 election, which brought the Social Democrats back to power.

Baunsgaard is often credited with being the first major Danish politician to truly embrace TV as the main media for communication with the voters. Although his appearance and style on the screen looks old-fashioned by today&#x27;s standards, he was way ahead of his contemporaries in politics. He managed to connect with the voters, and was consistently rated as the most trustworthy politician from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. However, his weak leadership of the government damaged his reputation. He remained as party leader until 1975, and resigned from parliament in 1977.

Baunsgaard was the main architect behind Nordek, a proposed organization for Nordic economic cooperation somewhat similar to the EEC (European Economic Community). The idea was embraced by both Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, but ultimately failed since Finland did not join due to its relationship with the Soviet Union, and Denmark joined the EEC.

<text>Mark Lombardi (March 23, 1951 – March 22, 2000) was an American neo-conceptual artist who specialized in drawings that document alleged financial and political frauds by power brokers, and in general &quot;the uses and abuses of power&quot;.

==Education and early career==
Lombardi was born in the town of Manlius, New York, just outside Syracuse, New York. He majored in art history at Syracuse University, and graduated with a B.A in 1974. While still an undergraduate, Lombardi had a job as chief researcher for a 1973 art exhibit &quot;Teapot Dome to Watergate&quot; – a multimedia collage, all of whose elements focused on various US governmental scandals; it was motivated by the then-ongoing Watergate scandal. In 1975, James Harithas (the former director of the Syracusan Everson Museum) hired Lombardi to be an assistant curator at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, Texas, where Harithas had become director. Lombardi worked there for approximately two years, until 1976. While in Houston, he also opened a small art gallery, &quot;Square One&quot;. Then, he became a general reference librarian for the Fine Arts department in the Houston Public Library, started a regional artist archive, and wrote two books, one on the drug wars and another on the neglected and forgotten art genre of panoramas.
During this time, Lombardi was also an abstract painter of no particular note; he pursued painting as a hobby during his actual career as an archivist and reference librarian.

==Late career==
Six years before his death, Lombardi switched to link analysis pencil diagrams of crime and conspiracy networks that he would become best known for. In the early 1990s, he began researching the many scandals of the time, including the BCCI scandal, the Harken Energy scandal, and the Savings and Loan scandal. The thousands (roughly 14500) of index cards that he accumulated in the course of this research began to overwhelm his ability to deal with them, and to cope, Mark began assembling them into physical outlines, and then into hand-written diagrams. These were intended to be a tool, to provide focus to his work, but he &quot;...soon decided that this method of combining text and image in a single field (called a drawing, diagram or flow chart, whichever you prefer) really worked for me in other ways as well.&quot; This decision was spurred, according to Lombardi, while he was talking with a friend about one of the participants in the Iran–Contra scandal, Adnan Khashoggi. Regarding this conversation, Lombardi wrote &quot;I began taking notes, then sketching out a simple tree chart, showing the breakdown of Khashoggi&#x27;s American holdings. Within days, I began making more of these charts, depicting other corporate networks I had researched. I was writing several pieces at the time and found the charts a useful, quick reference to the material at hand.&quot;

Initially, as the subject of one of his manuscripts, the primary focus was on the drug wars, but because of Pete Brewton&#x27;s January 1990 newspaper series about the Houston S&amp;L scandal, in which Brewton alleged that the Bush family, CIA members, and Mafia members took part in a &quot;de facto&quot; conspiracy to steal vast sums of money, Lombardi shifted his emphasis to investigating the laundering of the stolen money. 

Lombardi divorced in October 1996, and moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn at the urging of his friend Fred Tomaselli. There, he participated in a group show at the Drawing Center, called &quot;Selections: Winter 1997&quot;, followed by two solo art shows: &quot;Silent Partners&quot;, shown in November 1998 at Pierogi 2000 in Brooklyn, and &quot;Vicious Circles&quot;, a work drawing upon Jonathan Kwitny&#x27;s book of the same name dealing with Mafia involvement in the legitimate commercial markets, shown in 1999 at the Devon Golden Gallery in Chelsea. Mark was included in &quot;Versus IV&quot; - a Willoughby Sharp curated group effort juxtaposing five American artists (including John Drury, Neil Frankl, Alan Skarritt and Duff Schweninger in addition to Lombardi) with eight Europeans in Torino, Italy - also in 1998, where two of his drawings including &quot;Neil Bush and Silverado #2&quot; (1996) were printed in the accompanying catalogue. He also participated in another group show, &quot;Greater New York: New Art in New York Now&quot; in February 2000 at the P.S. 1 art gallery.

In March 2000, on the day before his death, Lombardi moved all his work to Pierogi 2000. He then bolted his apartment from the inside and hanged himself, on the day before his birthday and three years after he had moved to Williamsburg.

==Works==
Lombardi called his diagrams &quot;Narrative Structures&quot;. They are structurally similar to sociograms – a type of graph drawing used in the field of social network analysis, and to a lesser degree by earlier artists like Hans Haacke. 
Other important influences on Lombardi were philosopher Herbert Marcuse, and visualization expert Edward Tufte.

&quot;On October 17, 2001, five weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center...an FBI agent contacted the Whitney Museum of American Art...to obtain a reproduction of Mark Lombardi&#x27;s large drawing &quot;BCCI-ICIC &amp; FAB, 1972-1991&quot; (4th Version) or, if that were not possible, to see the actual work at the museum. At about the same time, Lombardi&#x27;s gallery, Pierogi, also received a telephone inquiry from a &#x27;lead investigator into the September 11th attacks.&#x27; Federal investigators wanted to obtain information pertaining to wealthy Saudi Arabian terrorist Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network by tracing his many financial connections...[to] BCCI,&quot; Robert Hobbs writes in his introduction to &quot;Global Networks&quot;. Hobbes continues: &quot;If government investigators had merely decided to include select members of the art world in their investigation in the 9/11 attacks, that fact alone would have been newsworthy. But when an F.B.I. agent consulted a work of art for clues pertaining to terrorist financing, she unwittingly made history.&quot;

In Lombardi&#x27;s historical diagrams, each node or connection was drawn from news stories from reputable media organizations, and his drawings document the purported financial and political frauds by power brokers.

According to Hobbs, who faced the overwhelming task of fact-checking Lombardi:

&quot;Certain things that are listed in the drawing are in red. These represent court judgments, actual dollar amounts. That is verifiable information. And I think that Lombardi himself realized that not everything could be verified. So I think what you have instead is names. We know about connections of names. Exactly what is that connection is hard to characterize. So that is a line with an arrow in one direction, or an arrow in two directions. So it&#x27;s really the abstract component of the work of art. It&#x27;s what can be represented, and – really – what cannot be represented.&quot;

For instance, his 1999 drawing &quot;George W. Bush, Harken Energy, and Jackson Stephens, ca 1979–90&quot; shows alleged connections between James Bath, the Bush and bin Laden families, and business deals in Texas and around the world. Following Lombardi&#x27;s suicide in 2000, the book &quot;Mark Lombardi: Global Networks&quot; was written in conjunction with a traveling exhibit. The editors chose to incorporate into the cover artwork (see image at right) a detail from &quot;George W. Bush, Harken Energy, and Jackson Stephens, ca 1979–90&quot;, showing George W. Bush (on the back cover of the book) and Osama bin Laden (in the upper left of the front cover) separated by one step from each other in the network, via Bath; the same connection between Bush and bin Laden was also highlighted in a 2003 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article that described the FBI&#x27;s interest in Lombardi&#x27;s works immediately following the September 11 attacks of 2001. Lombardi&#x27;s diagrams map the illicit flow of capital, amounting to a creative form of story-telling or, arguably, financial true crime.

Other subjects that interested Lombardi and were covered in his works include:
* Chicago Outfit
* Meyer Lansky
* The P2 conspiracy, Michele Sindona, Roberto Calvi
* World Finance Corporation
* Nugan Hand Ltd.
* Gerald Bull, Project Babylon, Space Research Corporation
* Iran–Contra, Lake Resources of Panama and Oliver North
* Global International Airways and the Indian Springs State Bank
* The Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and the arming of Saddam Hussein
* Charles Keating, Lincoln Savings (a subsidiary of American Continental Corporation)
* BCCI and ICIC
* Harken Energy Scandal, George W. Bush, James R. Bath, and Jackson T. Stephens
* Hans Kopp, Shakarchi Trading AG
* United Press International, and its attempted takeover by Pat Robertson with the aid of Beurt SerVaas.
* Jackson T. Stephens, the Lippo Group, and Bill Clinton; also, Clinton, the Lippo Group, and China Ocean Shipping Co.

==Posthumous exhibits==
A major exhibit of Lombardi&#x27;s art, &quot;Mark Lombardi: Global Networks,&quot; was organized by Independent Curators International and curated by Robert Hobbs. The exhibit traveled to nine museums over 2003–2005, and has been the subject of several reviews. The exhibit catalog was published by Independent Curators in 2003.

Several of Lombardi&#x27;s works were included in a 2010 show, NineteenEightyFour, hosted by the Austrian Cultural Forum New York. A re-exhibition of his work was held at the Pierogi Gallery in 2011 which, in addition to his drawings, included his bookshelf and a vitrine displaying some of his reference materials, as well as a 1996 video of Lombardi interviewed by Andy Mann.

20 of Lombardi&#x27;s drawings are in the permanent collection of MoMA.
Another 10 of his drawings are at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and were the subject of an FBI investigation after the September 11 attacks in 2001.

In 2012, German director Mareike Wegener released a documentary on Lombardi, entitled &quot;Mark Lombardi: Death-Defying Acts Of Art And Conspiracy&quot;. The movie premiered in May 2012 in Germany and the Brooklyn Film Festival, and then opened in September at MoMA in New York. Reviewers of the movie suggested that, unlike Lombardi&#x27;s own work, it relies too much on innuendo and too little on factual information, and that it focuses too much on testimonials from friends and does not adequately explain the impact of Lombardi&#x27;s art.

<text>Charles Linza McNary (June 12, 1874February 25, 1944) was an American Republican politician from Oregon. He served in the U.S. Senate from 1917 to 1944 and was Senate Minority Leader from 1933 to 1944. In the Senate, McNary helped to pass legislation that led to the construction of Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, and worked on agricultural and forestry issues. He also supported many of the New Deal programs at the beginning of the Great Depression. Until Mark Hatfield surpassed his mark in 1993, he was Oregon&#x27;s longest-serving senator.

McNary was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 1940, on the ticket with presidential candidate Wendell Willkie; both died in 1944, during what would have been their first term had they won. They lost to the Democratic ticket, composed of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was running for his third term as president, and Henry A. Wallace, by just under a ten-point margin.

McNary was a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1913 to 1915. He had been dean of Willamette University College of Law, in his hometown of Salem, from 1908 to 1913. Before that, he was a deputy district attorney under his brother, John Hugh McNary. John McNary later was appointed as a federal judge for the District of Oregon.

McNary died in office after unsuccessful surgery on a brain tumor. Oregon held a state funeral for him, during which his body lay in state at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem. McNary Dam, McNary Field, McNary High School, and McNary Country Club (on land he owned) in Oregon are named in his honor. He continues to have the record as the longest-serving Senate Minority Leader.

==Early life==

McNary was born on his maternal grandfather&#x27;s family farm north of Salem on June 12, 1874. He was the ninth of ten children, and the third son, born to Hugh Linza McNary and Mary Margaret McNary (&quot;née&quot; Claggett). When the two married in 1860, Hugh McNary&#x27;s father-in-law gave him a farm in what is now the city of Keizer.

McNary&#x27;s father helped on the family farm, then taught school for a few years before returning to farming near Salem.

McNary was four years old when his mother died in 1878. His widowed father moved the family to Salem where he bought a general merchandise store; he was unable to run the family farm because of declining health. Charles, known as Tot, began his education at a one-room school in Keizer and later attended Central School in Salem, living on North Commercial Street. Hugh McNary died in 1883, making Charlie an orphan at the age of nine.

Nina McNary became the head of the household, while other siblings took jobs in order to provide for the family. As a boy, Charles worked as a paperboy, in an orchard, and at other farming tasks. He met Herbert Hoover, a future U.S. president, who moved to Salem in 1888.

He later worked in the county recorder&#x27;s office for his brother John Hugh McNary, who had been elected as county recorder in 1890. For a short time he attended the Capital Business College. After leaving that school, he enrolled in college preparatory classes at Willamette University, with an eye toward attending Stanford University or the University of California.

During this time he met Jessie Breyman at a social club he helped start, and they began dating. Another member of the club was Oswald West, a future governor of Oregon.

===Legal career===

In the autumn of 1896, McNary moved to California to attend Stanford, where he studied law, economics, science, and history while working as a waiter to pay for his housing. He left Stanford and returned to Oregon in 1897 after his family asked him to come home.

Back in Salem, he read law under the supervision of his brother John and Samuel L. Hayden, and passed the bar in 1898.

The brothers practiced law together in Salem as McNary &amp; McNary, while John also served as deputy district attorney for Marion County. At this time, Charles bought the old family farm and returned it to the family. From 1909 to 1911 he served as president of the Salem Board of Trade, and in 1909 helped to organize the Salem Fruit Union, an agricultural association.

While still partnered with his brother, McNary began teaching property law at Willamette University College of Law in the spring of 1899 and courting Jessie Breyman. In 1908, he was hired as its dean to replace John W. Reynolds. As dean, he worked to enlarge the school and secure additional classroom space. He recruited prominent local attorneys to serve on the faculty and increased the size of the school from four graduates in 1908 to 36 in 1913, his last year as dean.

In his drive to make Willamette&#x27;s law school one of the top programs on the West Coast, he had it re-located from leased space in office buildings to the university campus.

On November 19, 1902, he married Jessie Breyman, the daughter of successful Salem businessman Eugene Breyman and his wife. Jessie died on July 3, 1918, in an automobile accident south of Newberg on her way home to Salem. She had been in Oregon to attend the funeral of her mother and was returning from Portland in the Boise family&#x27;s car when it flipped and crushed her. McNary spent several days in Oregon for her funeral and then returned to Washington. Charles and Jessie had no children.

==State politics==
McNary first held public office in 1892 when he became Marion County&#x27;s deputy recorder, serving in the position until 1896. In 1904 he managed a successful campaign of his brother, John, for district attorney for the third judicial district of Oregon. John appointed Charles as his deputy, and the latter served until 1911.

Steve Neal, McNary&#x27;s biographer, describes McNary as a progressive who stuck with the Republican Party in 1910, even when many progressives left the party in favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the direct election of US senators) that were supported by Oregonian William Simon U&#x27;Ren. McNary was also an early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies.

After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon&#x27;s railroad commission; he urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.

In 1913, West appointed McNary to the Oregon Supreme Court to fill a new position, created by the legislature&#x27;s expansion of the court from five justices to seven. At 39 he was the youngest of the justices, and McNary left law school and private practice behind. He quickly &quot;established himself as a judicial activist and strong advocate of progressive reform&quot;. A supporter of organized labor, McNary &quot;consistently defended the rights of injured workers and was not hesitant about using the bench as an instrument for social change&quot;, such as an eight-hour day for public employees. Unions supported McNary throughout his political career.

Several criminal convictions resulted from the Portland vice scandal in November 1912 which related to the city&#x27;s epicenes. By the time McNary was seated, some convictions had been appealed to the court. He wrote the dissenting opinion in the reversal of the conviction of prominent Portland attorney Edward McAllister. The dissent was described as emotionally charged and &quot;revealed a deeply seated personal discomfort with same-sex eroticism&quot;.

In 1914, the court moved into the new Oregon Supreme Court Building. McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time the office was partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a single vote, to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the discovery of uncounted ballots.

After his defeat, he served the remainder of his partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multi-ballot contest, with several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be its chair. He was seen as someone who could unify the progressive and conservative wings of the party in Oregon.

==Federal politics==
As chairman of the state&#x27;s Republican Party, McNary campaigned to get the Republican presidential nominee, Charles Evans Hughes, elected in the 1916 presidential election. Hughes, a former US Supreme Court justice and future chief justice, carried Oregon but lost the presidency to the incumbent, Woodrow Wilson.

When US Senator Harry Lane died in office, on May 23, 1917, McNary saw a chance to redeem himself after his failed bid for election to the Oregon Supreme Court. McNary was among several possible successors considered by Oregon Governor James Withycombe. The governor preferred someone who supported national women&#x27;s suffrage and Prohibition, and he shared with McNary an interest in farming. Furthermore, McNary supporters argued that both progressive and conservative factions of the Republican Party would accept McNary and that unity would give the party the best chance of retaining the Senate seat in the next election. Withycombe appointed McNary to the unexpired term on May 29.

After resigning as state party chairman, McNary prepared to campaign for a full term in the Senate. He faced Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives Robert N. Stanfield in the May 1918 Republican primary. McNary defeated Stanfield 52,546 to 30,999. In the November general election, he defeated Oswald West, a friend and former governor, by 82,360 to 64,303, to win a full, six-year term in the Senate. Meanwhile, Frederick W. Mulkey won the election to replace McNary and finished Lane&#x27;s original term, which would end in January 1919. Mulkey took office on November 6, 1918, replacing McNary in that seat.

Shortly after taking office, Mulkey resigned the seat effective December 17, 1918. McNary was reappointed to the Senate on December 12, 1918, and took office on December 18, instead of taking office in January, when the term he was elected to would have started.

Mulkey resigned in order to give McNary a slight seniority edge over other new members of the Senate. In 1920, former adversary Stanfield defeated incumbent Democrat George Earle Chamberlain for Oregon&#x27;s other Senate seat, making McNary the state&#x27;s senior senator. McNary won re-election to the Senate four times, in 1924, 1930, 1936, and 1942, serving in Washington, D.C., until his death.

===Senate years===
After World War I, Wilson sought Senate approval of the Treaty of Versailles. Because the treaty included provisions for establishing and joining the League of Nations, one of Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, Republicans opposed it. Going against much of his party, McNary, part of a group of senators known as &quot;reservationists&quot;, proposed minor changes to support the United States entry into the League. Ultimately, the Senate never ratified the Treaty of Versailles, and the United States never joined the League.

One of the prime opponents of Wilson and the League was Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge. After McNary demonstrated his skill in the debate over the League, Lodge took him under his wing, and the two formed a longtime friendship. The friendship helped McNary secure favorable committee assignments and ushered him into the inner power circle of the Senate. Early in his career, he served as chairman of the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee, and as a member of the Agriculture and Forestry Committee. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding asked McNary to be the Secretary of the Interior to replace Albert B. Fall because of Fall&#x27;s involvement in the ongoing Teapot Dome scandal. McNary declined, preferring to stay in the Senate.

In 1933, McNary was selected as the Senate Minority Leader by fellow Republicans, while the Senate was under Democratic control during the New Deal era. He remained Minority Leader for the rest of his time in office and &quot;hovered most of the time on the periphery of the Republican left&quot; and opposed disciplining Republican senators who supported Roosevelt. He supported many of the New Deal programs, at the beginning of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency. As World War II approached, he favored &quot;all aid to England and France short of war&quot;. He voted to keep an arms embargo in place but supported the Lend-Lease agreement with the British in 1941 and the reinstatement of Selective Service in 1940, in preparation for military conscription of civilian men.

As early as the 1920s, McNary supported the development of federal hydroelectric power dams, and in 1933, he introduced legislation that led to the building of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams on the Columbia, as public works projects. He voted for the US joining the World Court in 1926. He favored buying more National Forest lands, forest management via the McSweeney-McNary Act, fire protection for forests via the Clarke–McNary Act, and farm support. Although vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill was the forerunner of the farm legislation of the New Deal.

===Vice presidential nomination===

In 1940, he was the Republican nominee for vice president, as a western farm leader chosen to balance the ticket of presidential nominee Wendell Willkie, a pro-business leader from the east.

The two men differed on many issues. Writing for &quot;Life&quot; magazine shortly before the general election in 1940, Richard L. Neuberger said, &quot;Whether as Vice President of the U.S. Charley McNary can keep on endorsing Government-power projects, isolation, high tariffs and huge outlays for farm relief under a President who believes in none of these things remains to be seen.&quot; McNary&#x27;s acceptance speech reiterated his support for the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally owned power-producing corporation that Willkie, as &quot;the head of a far-flung [private] utilities empire&quot;, had opposed. During the campaign, McNary promoted farming issues and criticized foreign trade agreements, which, he said, had &quot;closed European markets to our grain, meat, fruits and fiber&quot;. The Willkie/McNary ticket lost decisively to the Roosevelt/Wallace ticket.

==Family and legacy==

On December 29, 1923, McNary married for the second time, to Cornelia Woodburn Morton. He met Morton at a dinner party during World War I, in her hometown of Washington, D.C. Before the marriage, she had worked as his private secretary. As with his first marriage, his second did not produce children, but Charles and Cornelia adopted a daughter, Charlotte, in 1935.

In 1926, McNary built a new $6,000 ranch-style house, which he designed himself, along two creeks on his farm north of Salem. His estate, called &quot;Fir Cone&quot;, featured a putting green, rose garden, tennis court, fishpond, and arboretum, and more than of trees. Fir Cone was described as Oregon&#x27;s Monticello by later Senator Richard L. Neuberger, as it hosted many meetings with politicians from the national stage. The farm included of nut and fruit orchards, through which McNary helped establish the filbert industry in Oregon and on which he developed the Imperial prune.

After complaining of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary went to the Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed a malignant brain tumor. They removed it that week, and McNary was released from the hospital on December 2, but the cancer had already spread to other parts of his body. He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter. He partly recovered from the surgery, but by February 24, 1944, when he was re-elected as Republican Senate leader, he was comatose. Charles L. McNary died in Fort Lauderdale. He was given a state funeral, during which his body lay in state in the chamber of the Oregon House of Representatives at the Oregon State Capitol, Salem, and then was buried in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem. At the time of his death, McNary held the record for longest-serving senator from Oregon — 9,726 days in office. This mark held for nearly 50 years, until broken by Mark O. Hatfield in 1993.

<doc id="981247" wikidata="Q587284" url="?curid=981247" title="Mahinda (Buddhist monk)">
<text>Mahinda () (285 BCE – 205 BCE) was an Indian Buddhist monk depicted in Buddhist sources as bringing Buddhism to Sri Lanka. He was a Mauryan prince and the first-born son of Emperor Ashoka from his first wife Queen Devi, and the older brother of Princess Sanghamitra.

Mahinda was sent as a Buddhist missionary to the Anuradhapura Kingdom in Sri Lanka. Mahinda attained arhatship and resided at Mihintale. He played an important role in proliferating Buddhism throughout the Indian subcontinent.

== Historical sources ==

The Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa, Sri Lanka&#x27;s two great religious chronicles, contain accounts of Mahinda travelling to Sri Lanka and converting King Devanampiya Tissa. These are the primary sources for accounts of his life and deeds. Inscriptions and literary references also establish that Buddhism became prevalent in Sri Lanka around the 3rd century BCE, the period when Mahinda lived. The inscription in Rajagala monastery confirm the fact that Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka to propagate Buddhism and lived there until his death.

The Mahavamsa says that Mahinda, the son of Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka and that Ashoka&#x27;s daughter became a nun and brought the Bodhi Tree.

Though Ashoka wanted his prodigal eldest son Mahendra to succeed him and made several attempts to bring him out of renunciation, due to the orthodox Hindu community&#x27;s refusal to accept a Buddhist Crown Prince from a Vaishya mother as well as Mahendra&#x27;s own lack of enthusiasm to take over an empire, he gave up. Though texts describe Mahendra&#x27;s motive in leaving for Sri Lanka as spiritual, historians have argued that it was more of a political motive. Ashoka had feared that Mahendra would be killed just like Sushima, so to keep him safe and to avoid any succession war, he sent him to Sri Lanka. The party left from Vedasagiri monastery, believed to be modern-day Sanchi.

Mahavamsa and Dipavamsa, the chronicles of Sri Lanka, record the arrival of the party on the full moon of Jettha, a national festival. At the time, King Devanampiya Tissa was participating in a hunting expedition in the Mihintale hills. It is said that Ashoka and Devanampiyatissa were previously acquainted and on good terms, having exchanged gifts upon their respective ascensions to the throne. Upon meeting the shaven-headed monks Devanampiyatissa was taken aback by their appearance and asked who they were. After exchanging greetings, Mahinda preached the Chulahatthipadopama Sutra, and the royal hunting party converted to Buddhism. The party was subsequently invited to Anuradhapura, the seat of the throne for a royal reception and to give further dharma talks. Mahinda subsequently gave two public talks sanctioned by Devanampiya Tissa, in the Royal Hall and in the Nandana Garden in the Royal Park, leading to the start of the public embrace of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The royal park Mahamegha was then set aside as the residence for Mahinda&#x27;s party, and in later times became the Mahavihara, the earliest centre of Buddhist culture and scholarship Sri Lanka. The Chetiyagirivihara monastery was then established in Mihintale.

Mahinda then sent for his sister Sanghamitta from Magadha, who was a nun, to start a female Buddhist order after local women had expressed a desire to join the Sangha. Mahinda also arranged for a bodhi sapling from the original tree in Bodh Gaya to be sent to Sri Lanka, where it was planted in the grounds of the Mahavihara and is still visible today.

After a month spent delivering discourses to Sri Lankans who had ventured to the capital, Mahinda retreated to Mihintale to spend the vassa during the monsoon season. As a result, a second royal-funded monastery was built there. Later, Mahinda organised for a stupa to be constructed, and a part of the bodily relics of Gautama Buddha were transferred from the Maurya Empire to Sri Lanka. Mahinda then had Arittha, Devanampiyatissa&#x27;s nephew, a bhikkhu, expound the Vinaya monastic code of discipline to further Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

Mahinda outlived Devanampiyatissa and died at the age of 80 in Sri Lanka. King Uttiya, who succeeded his brother, organized a state funeral for Mahinda and constructed a stupa to house his relics at Mihintale.

== Significance and legacy ==
The 20th century Sri Lankan monk Walpola Rahula described Mahinda as &quot;the father of Sinhalese literature&quot; as he had translated and written commentary for the Tripitaka in Sinhala, turning it into a literary language. He was also credited with introducing the culture of the Mauryan Empire to the island, along with its architecture. More recently, Suwanda H. J. Sugunasiri, a Canadian scholar, has identified him as the Redactor of the oldest Buddhapuja in the world (247 BCE).

Mihintale, the mountain where Mahinda supposedly first encountered King Devanampiyatissa and the site of his funerary stupa, is an important pilgrimage site in Sri Lanka. Pilgrimages are traditionally undertaken in the month of June (Poson in the old Sinhala calendar), when Mahinda is believed to have arrived in Sri Lanka on the full-moon night of the month, a traditional time for religious observances in Theravada Buddhism.

<doc id="981252" wikidata="Q238851" url="?curid=981252" title="Oceanic crust">
<text>Oceanic crust is the uppermost layer of the oceanic portion of the tectonic plates. It is composed of the upper oceanic crust, with pillow lavas and a dike complex, and the lower oceanic crust, composed of troctolite, gabbro and ultramafic cumulates. The crust overlies the rigid uppermost layer of the mantle. The crust and the rigid upper mantle layer together constitute oceanic lithosphere.

Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks, or sima, which is rich in iron and magnesium. It is thinner than continental crust, or sial, generally less than 10 kilometers thick; however, it is denser, having a mean density of about 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter as opposed to continental crust which has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter.

The crust uppermost is the result of the cooling of magma derived from mantle material below the plate. The magma is injected into the spreading center, which consists mainly of a partly solidified crystal mush derived from earlier injections, forming magma lenses that are the source of the sheeted dikes that feed the overlying pillow lavas. As the lavas cool they are, in most instances, modified chemically by seawater. These eruptions occur mostly at mid-ocean ridges, but also at scattered hotspots, and also in rare but powerful occurrences known as flood basalt eruptions. But most magma crystallises at depth, within the lower oceanic crust. There, newly intruded magma can mix and react with pre-existing crystal mush and rocks.

==Composition==
Although a complete section of oceanic crust has not yet been drilled, geologists have several pieces of evidence that help them understand the ocean floor. Estimations of composition are based on analyses of ophiolites (sections of oceanic crust that are thrust onto and preserved on the continents), comparisons of the seismic structure of the oceanic crust with laboratory determinations of seismic velocities in known rock types, and samples recovered from the ocean floor by submersibles, dredging (especially from ridge crests and fracture zones) and drilling. Oceanic crust is significantly simpler than continental crust and generally can be divided in three layers. According to mineral physics experiments, at lower mantle pressures, oceanic crust becomes denser than the surrounding mantle.
* Layer 1 is on an average 0.4 km thick. It consists of unconsolidated or semiconsolidated sediments, usually thin or even not present near the mid-ocean ridges but thickens farther away from the ridge. Near the continental margins sediment is terrigenous, meaning derived from the land, unlike deep sea sediments which are made of tiny shells of marine organisms, usually calcareous and siliceous, or it can be made of volcanic ash and terrigenous sediments transported by turbidity currents.
* Layer 2 could be divided into two parts: layer 2A – 0.5 km thick uppermost volcanic layer of glassy to finely crystalline basalt usually in the form of pillow basalt, and layer 2B – 1.5 km thick layer composed of diabase dikes.
* Layer 3 is formed by slow cooling of magma beneath the surface and consists of coarse grained gabbro and cumulate ultramafic rocks. It constitutes over two-thirds of oceanic crust volume with almost 5 km thickness.

===Geochemistry===
The most voluminous volcanic rocks of the ocean floor are the mid-oceanic ridge basalts, which are derived from low-potassium tholeiitic magmas. These rocks have low concentrations of large ion lithophile elements (LILE), light rare earth elements (LREE), volatile elements and other highly incompatible elements. There can be found basalts enriched with incompatible elements, but they are rare and associated with mid-ocean ridge hot spots such as surroundings of Galapagos Islands, the Azores and Iceland.

Prior to the Neoproterozoic Era 1000 Ma ago the world&#x27;s oceanic crust was more mafic than present-days&#x27;. The more mafic nature of the crust meant that higher amounts of water molecules (OH) could be stored the altered parts of the crust. At subduction zones this mafic crust was prone to metamorphose into greenschist instead of blueschist at ordinary blueschist facies.

===Life cycle===
Oceanic crust is continuously being created at mid-ocean ridges. As continental plates diverge at these ridges, magma rises into the upper mantle and crust. As the continental plates move away from the ridge, the newly formed rocks cool and start to erode with sediment gradually building up on top of them. The youngest oceanic rocks are at the oceanic ridges, and they get progressively older away from the ridges.

As the mantle rises it cools and melts, as the pressure decreases and it crosses the solidus. The amount of melt produced depends only on the temperature of the mantle as it rises. Hence most oceanic crust is the same thickness (7±1 km). Very slow spreading ridges (&lt;1 cm·yr−1 half-rate) produce thinner crust (4–5 km thick) as the mantle has a chance to cool on upwelling and so it crosses the solidus and melts at lesser depth, thereby producing less melt and thinner crust. An example of this is the Gakkel Ridge under the Arctic Ocean. Thicker than average crust is found above plumes as the mantle is hotter and hence it crosses the solidus and melts at a greater depth, creating more melt and a thicker crust. An example of this is Iceland which has crust of thickness ~20 km.

The age of the oceanic crust can be used to estimate the (thermal) thickness of the lithosphere, where young oceanic crust has not had enough time to cool the mantle beneath it, while older oceanic crust has thicker mantle lithosphere beneath it. The oceanic lithosphere subducts at what are known as convergent boundaries. These boundaries can exist between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and oceanic lithosphere on another, or between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and continental lithosphere on another. In the second situation, the oceanic lithosphere always subducts because the continental lithosphere is less dense. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old.
The process of super-continent formation and destruction via repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Wilson Cycle.

The oldest large-scale oceanic crust is in the west Pacific and north-west Atlantic — both are about up to 180-200 million years old. However, parts of the eastern Mediterranean Sea could be remnants of the much older Tethys Ocean, at about 270 and up to 340 million years old.

==Magnetic anomalies==
The oceanic crust displays a pattern of magnetic lines, parallel to the ocean ridges, frozen in the basalt. A symmetrical pattern of positive and negative magnetic lines emanates from the mid-ocean ridge. New rock is formed by magma at the mid-ocean ridges, and the ocean floor spreads out from this point. When the magma cools to form rock, its magnetic polarity is aligned with the then-current positions of the magnetic poles of the Earth. New magma then forces the older cooled magma away from the ridge. This process results in parallel sections of oceanic crust of alternating magnetic polarity.

<text>Whitelaw Reid (October 27, 1837 – December 15, 1912) was an American politician, diplomat and newspaper editor, as well as the author of &quot;Ohio in the War&quot;, a popular work of history.

After assisting Horace Greeley as editor of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, Reid purchased the paper after Greeley&#x27;s death in late 1872 and controlled it until his own death. The circulation grew to about 60,000 a day, but the weekly edition became less important. He invested heavily in new technology, such as the Hoe rotary printing press and the linotype machine, but bitterly fought against the unionized workers for control of his shop.

As a famous voice of the Republican Party, he was honored with appointments as ambassador to France and Great Britain, as well as numerous other honorific positions. Reid was the party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President of the United States in the 1892 election. In 1898, President William McKinley appointed him to the American commission that negotiated peace with Spain after the Spanish–American War.

==Early life==

Reid was born on a farm near Xenia, Ohio, to Robert Charlton Reid (1795–1865) and Marion Whitelaw Ronalds (1804–1895), of the Clan Ronald of Scotland, who had married in 1820. His forefathers are believed to come from Old Kilpatrick in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. As a child growing up, his family was poor.

Reid attended Xenia Academy in his hometown, and went on to graduate from Miami University with honors in 1856. At Miami, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Kappa chapter), and lobbied for the expulsion of the six members who ultimately founded Sigma Chi.

==Career==

During the American Civil War, Reid wrote under the by-line &quot;Agate&quot;, acting as a correspondent at several battlefields, including the Battles of Shiloh and Gettysburg. His account of the Battle of Shiloh contains tales of confusion, courage, and disaster narrowly averted, and was described as classic war reporting.

In 1868, he joined the staff of Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. The following year, he was named managing editor. In 1872, Reid was part of the Liberal Republicans, a movement that opposed a second term for President Grant and that ultimately supported the ill-fated Greeley for the presidency. Greeley died just days after the election, and a short time later, Reid became the new editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

Reid continued the role of the &quot;Tribune&quot; as one of the foremost Republican newspapers in the country. He emphasized the importance of partisan newspapers in a speech in 1879:
: The true statesman and the really influential editor are those who are able to control and guide parties... There is an old question as to whether a newspaper controls public opinion or public opinion controls the newspaper. This at least is true: that editor best succeeds who best interprets the prevailing and the better tendencies of public opinion, and, who, whatever his personal views concerning it, does not get himself too far out of relations to it. He will understand that a party is not an end, but a means; will use it if it lead to his end, -- will use some other if that serve better, but will never commit the folly of attempting to reach the end without the means... Of all the puerile follies that have masqueraded before High Heaven in the guise of Reform, the most childish has been the idea that the editor could vindicate his independence only by sitting on the fence and throwing stones with impartial vigor alike at friend and foe.

===U.S. Ambassador to France===
During the Hayes and Garfield administrations, he was offered diplomatic posts in Germany, both of which he refused. However, upon the election of President Benjamin Harrison, he was offered the role of United States Ambassador to France, which he accepted and served as from 1889 to 1892. As ambassador, he rented the palace of the Duke of Gramont, in the Avenue Hoche in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, where he entertained extensively during his three years in office.

During that period of post-Civil War America, Reid&#x27;s views were similar to many of his contemporaries in that he did not see a need for the United States to exert its influence beyond North and South America. Instead, he favored a small navy and opposed the acquisition of Hawaii. Reid resigned his post in the Spring of 1892 and returned to America.

===1892 presidential election===
In 1892, Reid became the Republican vice presidential nominee when President Harrison chose to drop the sitting vice president, Levi P. Morton, from the ticket. As Harrison&#x27;s wife was dying, Reid was a more active candidate than the president. Despite his best efforts, Harrison and Reid lost to the Democratic ticket of Grover Cleveland and Adlai Stevenson, as Cleveland became the first former president to recapture the office.

==Appointed offices==
In 1897, he was appointed a special envoy representing the United States at Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

In 1898, Reid was given a spot on the peace commission, along with former Secretary of State William R. Day, and Senators William P. Frye, Cushman Kellogg Davis, and George Gray, following the Spanish–American War.

In June 1902, he was again appointed a special envoy representing the United States at the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, along with J. Pierpont Morgan Jr., Edmund Lincoln Baylies, and William Wetmore, and brought his wife and daughter to London. The coronation was postponed, however, as the King fell ill, and the rescheduled ceremony in August took place after Reid (and most of the other international representatives) had returned home.

While in London, he received the degree LL.D. &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Cambridge in June 1902. In 1904, he was made Chancellor of the University of the State of New York. He also received honorary degrees from Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, Oxford, St. Andrews, Victoria, and Manchester.

Reid&#x27;s role as one of the leading Americans in London in 1898 allowed him to promote American interests in a way that ran parallel to the efforts of America&#x27;s ambassador John Hay, with whom Reid had been lifelong friends (Reid had even served as best man at Hay&#x27;s wedding.) In April 1898 the United States and Spain went to war. While some public figures from continental Europe such as Édouard Drumont, Gaston Méry, Max Régis, Auguste Mercier and Bernhard von Bülow had been making high-profile public statements condemning the United States and praising Spain, Reid was part of an effort to counter this. Reid organized public speaking events where British politicians who he knew were of a pro-American perspective on the war, such as Joseph Chamberlain would make the American case for war to the British public. He was aided in this effort by British publisher W. T. Stead. When a widely printed article co-written and co-signed by Édouard Drumont, Gaston Méry, and Max Régis that was translated into many languages was making the rounds in various European newspapers in the summer of 1898, Reid got many British celebrities including Arthur Henry Neumann, Percy Powell-Cotton, Harald George Carlos Swayne and Arthur Jephson to write a counter-letter advocating support for the American point of view. The counter-letter was published in W. T. Stead&#x27;s &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and other papers that had wide British distribution. Harry Johnston wrote from Tunis agreeing with the position, and Reid, using his Stead connections, got that letter published as well. Adding to this, Reid arranged so that Arthur Henry Neumann, Percy Powell-Cotton, and Arthur Jephson would all give brief speeches repeating their written arguments at the Royal Geographical Society and then again later at a handful of high-profile dinners hosted by Reid. One of the dinners was attended by William Archer. Privately, both Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley, and Evelyn Wood confided in Reid that they supported the American position in the war, but they also believed that their status as high-ranking officers in the British military made it impossible to publicly issue policy statements in the way that Reid wanted.

===U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom===
In 1905, he was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s by Theodore Roosevelt, succeeding Joseph Hodges Choate (1832–1917) in that role. Choate&#x27;s predecessor, John Hay, who became the United States Secretary of State, was Reid&#x27;s friend of forty years with Reid serving as the best man at Hay&#x27;s wedding. He served in this role, including during the William Howard Taft administration, until his death in 1912.

==Personal life==

On April 26, 1881, he married Elisabeth Mills (1857–1931), the daughter of Darius Ogden Mills (1825–1910) and the sister of Ogden Mills (1856–1929). The Reids were social people and threw lavish parties, including a musicale at their residence in Manhattan, at Madison Avenue and 50th Street, for 400 people, in 1901. Shortly before his death, Reid hosted the Duke and Duchess of Connaught at his New York home. Elisabeth Mills Reid was the founder of the American Girls&#x27; Club in Paris. Together, they were the parents of:

* Ogden Mills Reid (1882–1947), who married Helen Miles Rogers (1882–1970), in 1911.
* Jean Templeton Reid (1884–1962), who married Hon. Sir John Hubert Ward (1870–1938), the son of William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley, in 1908.

===Memberships===
In New York, Reid was a member of the University Club, Century Club, Metropolitan Club, Union League Club, and Republican Club of New York. He was president of the Lotos Club for 14 years, and belonged to the Ohio Society, New England Society, St. Andrew&#x27;s Society, and the American Geographical Society.

From 1902 until his death in 1912, he was a member of Stanford University&#x27;s board of trustees. Manhattanville University in Purchase, New York, is located on his former Westchester County estate, which was leased to the King and Queen of Siam, Prajadhipok and Rambhai Barni, in 1931.

===Descendants===
He was the grandfather of prominent journalist and &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; editor Whitelaw Reid (1913–2009) and Ogden Rogers Reid (1925–2019), a former member of the United States House of Representatives.

==Death and legacy==
Reid died in London while serving as the ambassador to Britain on December 15, 1912. Upon his death, letters of condolences were sent to the family by King George V, Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra, and Princess Victoria. His remains are buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

<text>Dharmarakṣita (Sanskrit, &#x27;Protected by the Dharma&#x27;)(Pali: Dhammarakkhita), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize Buddhism. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: &quot;Yona&quot;, lit. &quot;Ionian&quot;) in the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, and his activities are indicative of some Hellenistic Greeks following Buddhism during its early centuries.

Greek communities had been present in neighbouring Bactria and in northwestern India since the time of the conquests of Alexander the Great around 323 BCE, and developed into the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom until the end of the 1st century BCE. Greeks were generally described in ancient times throughout the Classical world as &quot;Yona&quot;, &quot;Yonaka&quot; or &quot;Yavanas&quot;, lit. “Ionians&quot;. They were ardent recipients of Buddhism and the example of Dharmarakṣita indicates that they even took an active role in spreading Buddhism as leading missionaries.

==A Greek Buddhist missionary==
The efforts of Emperor Ashoka to spread the Buddhist faith are described in the Edicts of Ashoka carved during his reign on stone pillars and cave walls:
: &quot;Here in the king&#x27;s domain among the Greeks, the Kambojas, the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods&#x27; instructions in Dhamma.&quot; Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika)

Ashoka also claimed to have sent emissaries beyond his borders, as far as the Greek kings of the Mediterranean:
:&quot;Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni.&quot; Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika)

Dharmaraksita is then described in important Buddhist Pali historical texts, the &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot; and the &quot;Mahāvaṃsa&quot;, as being a Greek Buddhist missionary, in charge of propagating the faith to the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.

:&quot;When the thera Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror, had brought the (third) council to an end (…) he sent forth theras, one here and one there:
:* The thera Mahyantika he sent to Kasmira and Gandhara,
:* The thera, Mahadeva he sent to Mahisamandala.
:* To Vanavasa be sent the thera named Rakkhita,
:* and to Aparantaka (he sent) the Yona named Dhammarakkhita;
:* to Maharattha (he sent) the thera named Mahadhammarakkhita,
:* but the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the country of the Yona.
:* He sent the thera Majjhima to the Himalaya country,
:* and to Suvambhurni he sent the two theras Sona and Uttara.
:* The great thera Mahinda, the theras Utthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his disciples, these five theras he sent forth with the charge: `Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka the lovely religion of the Conqueror.&#x27;&quot; (Mahavamsa, XII)

The country of Aparantaka has been identified as the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, and comprises Northern Gujarat, Kathiawar, Kachch, and Sindh, the area where Greek communities were probably concentrated.

Dharmarashita is said to have preached the Aggikkhandopama Sutra, so that 37,000 people were converted in Aparantaka and that thousands of men and women entered the Order (&quot;pabbajja&quot;):

:&quot;The thera Dhammarakkhita the Yona, being gone to Aparantaka and having preached in the midst of the people the Aggikkhandhopama-sutta gave to drink of the nectar of truth to thirty-seven thousand living beings who had come together there, lie who perfectly understood truth and untruth. A thousand men and yet more women went forth from noble families and received the pabbajja&quot; (Mahavamsa XII, Dipavamsa. VIII.7)

==Dharmaraksita and Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera==
In another Pali reference, a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka named Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera is said to have been to India in order to study with &quot;the Yonaka Dhammarakkhita&quot;, whereupon he attained the &quot;patisambhida&quot; (analytical knowledge). (VibhA.389, Sammoha-Vinodaní, Vibhanga Commentary).

The place where Dharmaraksita resides is also said to be around 100 leagues (around 700 miles) from Sri Lanka, putting it somewhere in northern India. (See: )

==Dharmaraksita and the Milinda Panha==
The &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; is another famous non-canonical Pāli Buddhist text that describes the religious dialogues between the famous Indo-Greek king Menander, whose kingdom was in Sagala in today&#x27;s Punjab, and a Buddhist monk called Nagasena, around 160 BCE. It is today one of the texts of reference of Theravada Buddhism.

According to the Milinda Panha (I 32-35), the monk Nagasena, before his encounter with Menander, was once a student of Dharmaraksita and learnt Buddhism and reached enlightenment as an Arhat under his guidance in Pataliputra.
This event took place roughly a hundred years after the missionary efforts of Ashoka, and it would suggest that Dharmaraksita was a young man under Ashoka, became a respected elder settled in the Ashokan capital of Pataliputra, and then trained a young Nagasena in the Tripiṭaka and towards enlightenment, before Nagasena himself met Menander at a venerable age.

The Milinda Panha therefore seems to relate the dialogue between a great Greek king, Menander I, with a monk trained in Buddhism by the great Greek Buddhist elder Dharmaraksita, tending to suggest the importance of Greeks during the first formative centuries of Buddhism.

<doc id="981281" wikidata="Q5868890" url="?curid=981281" title="History of sonata form">
<text>Sonata form is one of the most influential ideas in the history of Western classical music. Since the establishment of the practice by composers like C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert and the codification of this practice into teaching and theory, the practice of writing works in sonata form has changed considerably.

== Late Baroque era (ca 1710 – ca 1750) ==

Properly speaking, sonata form did not exist in the Baroque period; however, the forms which led to the standard definition did. In fact, there is a greater variety of harmonic patterns in Baroque works called &quot;sonatas&quot; than in the Classical period. The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti provide examples of the range of relationships of theme and harmony possible in the 1730s and 1740s.

Sonatas were at first written mainly for the violin. Over time, a formal type evolved, predominating until the late 18th century. This type reached its peak in the sonatas of J.S. Bach, Handel, and Tartini, who followed older Italian models and employed a type attributable to masters such as Corelli and Vivaldi (&quot;Musical Form&quot;, Leichtentritt, Hugo, p. 122). By the 1730s and 1740s, the direction of instrumental works, often considered less important than vocal music, tended towards an overall two-part layout: the binary form. But a section of contrasting material which served as a bridge between them also came to be included.

== Classical era (ca 1750 – ca 1825) ==

The older Italian sonata form differs considerably from the later sonata in the works of the Viennese Classical masters. Between the two main types, the older Italian and the more &quot;modern&quot; Viennese sonata, various transitional types are manifest in the middle of the 18th century, in the works of the Mannheim composers, Johann Stamitz, Franz Xaver Richter, C.P.E. Bach, and many others.

The crucial elements that led to the sonata form were the weakening of the difference between binary and ternary form; the shift of texture away from full polyphony (many voices in imitation) to homophony (a single dominant voice and supporting harmony); and the increasing reliance on juxtaposing different keys and textures. As different key relationships took on a more and more specific meaning, the schematics of works altered. Devices such as the false reprise fell out of favor, while other patterns grew in importance.

Quite probably the most influential composer on the early development of sonata form was C.P.E. Bach, a son of J.S. Bach. Taking the harmonic and voice-leading techniques that his father had developed, he applied them to the homophonic style – allowing dramatic shifts in key and mood, while maintaining an overall coherence. C.P.E. Bach was a decisive influence on Joseph Haydn. One of C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s most lasting innovations was the shortening of the theme to a motif, which could be shaped more dramatically in pursuit of development. By 1765, C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s themes, rather than being long melodies, had taken on the style of themes used in sonata form: short, characteristic, and flexible. By linking the changes in the theme to the harmonic function of the section, C.P.E. Bach laid the groundwork that composers such as Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would exploit.

The practice of the great Classical masters, specifically Haydn and Mozart, forms the basis for the description of the sonata form. Their works served both as the model for the form, and as the source for new works conceived in the sonata form itself. Debates about sonata form therefore reference the practice of Haydn and Mozart extensively.

Joseph Haydn is thought of as &quot;the Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;the Father of the String Quartet&quot;. He can also be thought of as the father of the sonata form as a means of structuring works. His string quartets and symphonies in particular display not merely the range of applications of the form, but also the way to exploit its dramatic potential. It is predominantly Haydn who created the transition to the development and the transition to the recapitulation, as moments of supreme tension and dramatic interest. It is also Haydn who enabled a more expansive contour for works, by making every aspect of the harmony of a work implicit in its main theme. This is no small innovation, in that it creates a homophonic analog to the polyphonic fugue – a seed of potential from which the composer could later germinate a range of different effects. Haydn&#x27;s variety of dramatic effects and ability to create tension was remarked upon in his own time: his music was increasingly taken as the standard by which other practice might be judged.

Haydn&#x27;s set of string quartets, Op. 33 gives the first examples of coordinated use of the resources of sonata form in characteristic fashion. The composer himself listed them as being written on completely new principles and marking the turning point in his technique.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart applied the large-scale ideas of Haydn to opera and the piano concerto. Mozart&#x27;s fluidity with the creation of themes, and the dense network of motives and their parts give his work a surface polish which was remarked upon even by his professional rivals. Mozart favored sonata form and the sonata cycle. Most of his compositions were in sonata cycle. He explored every genre of his day and perfected them all. By the end of his short life, Mozart had absorbed Haydn&#x27;s technique and applied it to his own more elongated sense of theme, for example in the Prague Symphony.

== Romantic period (ca 1800 – ca 1910) ==

Ludwig van Beethoven was the composer who most directly inspired the theorists who codified sonata form as a particular practice. While he was grounded in the fluid phrase structures and wider variety of possible schematic layouts that came from Haydn and Mozart, his deepest innovation was to work from both ends of a sonata form, conceiving of the entire structure, and then polishing themes which would support that overarching design. He continued to expand the length and weight of the sonata forms used by Haydn and Mozart, as well as frequently using motives and harmonic models drawn from the two older composers. He shares both the Classical and Romantic eras. Because of his use of increasingly characteristic rhythms and disruptive devices, he is seen as a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic periods.

In the Romantic era, sonata form was first explicitly defined and became institutionalized. Academic scholars like Adolph Bernhard Marx wrote descriptions of the form, often with a normative goal; that is, a goal of stating how works in sonata form &quot;should&quot; be composed. While the first-movement form had been the subject of theoretical works, it was seen as the pinnacle of musical technique. Part of the training of 19th-century composers was to write in sonata form and to favor sonata form in the first movement of multi-movement compositions, like symphonies, piano concertos, and string quartets.

The 19th century&#x27;s procedure for writing sonatas diverged from earlier Classical practice, in that it focused more on themes than on the placement of cadences. The monothematic exposition (a common characteristic of Haydn&#x27;s sonata-form movements) largely disappeared, and the themes of the first and second groups were expected to contrast in character. More generally, the formal outline of a sonata came to be viewed more in terms of its themes or groups of themes, rather than the sharp differentiation of tonal areas based on cadences. In the Classical period, establishing the expectation of a particular cadence and then delaying or avoiding it was a common way of creating tension. In the 19th century, with its dramatically expanded harmonic vocabulary, avoidance of a cadence did not have the same degree of unexpectedness. Instead, more distant key regions were established by a variety of other means, including use of increasingly dissonant chords, pedal points, texture, and alteration of the main theme itself.

In the Classical period, the contrast between theme groups, while useful, was not required. The first theme group tended to outline the tonic chord, and the second theme tended to be more &quot;cantabile&quot; in character. But this was far from universal – as Haydn&#x27;s monothematic expositions and Beethoven&#x27;s early rhythmic themes show. Because the power of harmonic opposition, both between tonic and dominant and between major and minor, had less force in the Romantic vocabulary, stereotypes of the character of themes became stronger. Nineteenth-century theorists described the sonata principle as one of opposition between two groups of themes. Thus, it was thought by Marx that the first theme should be &quot;masculine&quot; – strident, rhythmic, and implying a dissonance – and the second theme group should be drawn more from vocal melody making it &quot;feminine&quot;. It is this contrast between &quot;rhythmic&quot; and &quot;singing&quot; that Wagner, in his very influential work &quot;On Conducting&quot;, argued was at the very core of tension in music. That texture, as Wagner argued, is the most important contrast and that tempo should be used to emphasize this contrast. Thus, fast sections were conducted faster and slow sections were conducted slower.

By requiring that harmony move with the themes, 19th-century sonata form imposed a kind of discipline on composers and also allowed audiences to comprehend the music by following the appearance of recognizable melodies. However, the sonata form, as an inherited formal mold, also created a tension for Romantic composers between the desire to combine poetical expression and academic rigor.

Later Romantic commentators and theorists detected a &quot;sonata idea&quot; of increasing formalization. They drew a progression of works from Haydn, through Mozart and Beethoven, whereby more and more movements in a multi-movement work were felt to be in sonata form. These theorists present the theory that originally only first movements were in that form, then later last movements as well (for example Mozart&#x27;s Prague Symphony), and eventually the &quot;sonata principle&quot; came to extend through an entire work. For example, Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet Op. 59 No. 2 was said to have all four movements in sonata form. By this, theorists such as Donald Tovey meant the academically laid-out sonata form. Charles Rosen has argued that, properly understood, this was always the case: that real &quot;sonata forms&quot; (plural) were always present, though this is not universally agreed on.

As the 19th century progressed, the complexity of sonata form grew, as new ways of moving through the harmony of a work were introduced by Johannes Brahms and Franz Liszt. Instead of focusing exclusively on keys closely related in the circle of fifths, they used movement along circles based on minor or major triads. Following the trend established by Beethoven, the focus moved more and more to the development section. This was in line with the Romantic comparison of music to poetry. Poetic terms, such as &quot;rhapsody&quot; and &quot;tone poem&quot;, entered music, and increasingly musicians felt that they should not take the repeats in symphonies because there was no dramatic or lyrical point to doing so. This changed their interpretation of previous sonata forms.

The Romantic sonata form was an especially congenial mold for Brahms, who felt a strong affinity with the composers of the Classical era. Brahms adopted and extended Beethoven&#x27;s practice of modulating to more remote keys in the exposition, combining this with the use of counterpoint in the inner voices. For example, his piano quintet has the first subject in F minor, but the second subject is in C sharp minor, an augmented fifth higher. In the same work, the key scheme of the recapitulation is also altered – the second subject in the recapitulation is in F sharp minor, rather than the F minor of the first subject.

Another force acting on sonata form was the school of composers centering on Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. They sought to integrate more roving harmonies and unprepared chords into the musical structure in order to attain both formal coherence and a full, expressive range of keys. Increasingly, themes began to have notes which were far from the original key, a procedure later labeled &quot;extended tonality&quot;. This trend strongly influenced the next generation of composers, for instance Gustav Mahler. The first movements of several of his symphonies are described as being in sonata form, although they diverge from the standard scheme quite dramatically. Some have even argued that the entirety of his first symphony (in which material from the first movement returns in the fourth movement) is meant to be one massive sonata-allegro form.

As the result of these innovations, works became more sectional. Composers such as Liszt and Anton Bruckner even began to include explicit pauses in works between sections. The length of sonata movements grew starting in the 1830s. Franz Lachner &#x27;s &quot;Prize Symphony&quot;, a work seldom played today, had a first movement longer than any symphonic first movement by Beethoven. The length of whole works also increased correspondingly. Tone poems, which were often in sonata form, greatly extended their length in comparison to traditional overtures. For instance, Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot; Overture is as long as some middle-period Haydn symphonies.

One debate in the 19th century was over whether it was acceptable to use the layout of a poem or other literary work to structure a work of instrumental music. The compositional school focused around Liszt and Wagner (the so-called New German School) argued in favor of literary inspiration (see Program music), while another camp, centered on Schumann, Brahms, and Eduard Hanslick argued that pure music should follow the forms laid out by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. This conflict was eventually internalized, and by 1900, though the debate still raged, composers such as Richard Strauss would freely combine programmatic and symphonic structure, such as in the work &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot;.

== Modern era ==

In the Modern period, sonata form became detached from its traditional harmonic basis. The works of Schoenberg, Debussy, Sibelius and Richard Strauss emphasized different scales other than the traditional major-minor scale and used chords that did not clearly establish tonality. It could be argued that by the 1930s, sonata form was merely a rhetorical term for any movement that stated themes, took them apart, and put them back together again. However, even composers of atonal music, such as Roger Sessions and Karl Hartmann, continued to use outlines that clearly pointed back to the practice of Beethoven and Haydn, even if the method and style were quite different. At the same time, composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten, and Dmitri Shostakovich revived the idea of a sonata form by more complex and extended use of tonality.

In more recent times, Minimalism has searched for new ways to develop form, and new outlines which, again, while not being based on the same harmonic plan as the Classical sonata, are clearly related to it. An example is Aaron Jay Kernis&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in Waves&quot; from the early 1990s.

<text>Mount Nirvana, at is the unofficial name of the highest mountain in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The mountain is a part of Nahanni National Park Reserve, the largest national park in the Northwest Territories.
==History==

Part of the Mackenzie Mountains, it was first climbed by Bill Buckingham and Lew Surdam in July 1965. Buckingham gave the mountain the moniker of &quot;Mount Nirvana&quot; at that time.

Before 2016, only five successful ascent were recorded, all with the assistance of helicopters or floatplane. In June 2016, Nirvana was climbed without assistance for the first time.

<doc id="981283" wikidata="Q3182721" url="?curid=981283" title="John Wetteland">
<text>John Karl Wetteland (born August 21, 1966) is an American former baseball pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (1989–2000). He pitched for four teams: the Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. A relief pitcher, Wetteland specialized as a closer, recording 330 saves during his career. With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award for saving four games in the series. After his playing career, he served as a coach for the Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners. In 2019, Wetteland was arrested and indicted on charges of sexually abusing a child under the age of 14. These charges were later dismissed.

==Playing career==
Wetteland attended Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, California. The New York Mets selected him in the 12th round of the 1984 MLB draft, but he opted not to sign, feeling he was not ready for a professional career. He enrolled at the College of San Mateo. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Wetteland as their second choice in the secondary phase of the 1985 MLB draft, and he signed with Los Angeles.

In 1986, Wetteland played for the Bakersfield Dodgers of the Class A California League, but struggled, pitching to a 0–7 win–loss record in 15 games, and was demoted to the Great Falls Dodgers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. The Detroit Tigers selected Wetteland from the Dodgers in the 1987 Rule 5 draft, but was returned to the Dodgers during spring training in 1988, when they chose to carry Jim Walewander with their final roster spot. In 1988, Wetteland pitched for the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. While playing in the Pacific Coast League, he garnered notice by earning 20 saves in 20 chances. He made his major league debut on May 31, 1989. After struggling with his first five starts in 1990, Wetteland asked to become a relief pitcher.

After the 1991 season, Wetteland was traded twice; first to the Cincinnati Reds with Tim Belcher for Eric Davis and Kip Gross in November, and then to the Montreal Expos with Bill Risley for Dave Martinez, Scott Ruskin, and Willie Greene in December. In 1992, he became the Expos&#x27; closer. On April 5, 1995, the Expos traded Wetteland to the New York Yankees for Fernando Seguignol.

During the 1996 season, he led the American League in saves, totaling 43, and appeared in the All-Star Game. During the 1996 World Series, Wetteland recorded four saves and the Yankees won the World Series against the Atlanta Braves in six games. Wetteland won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, recording the maximum four saves possible during the Series, tying the record for the most saves in a single postseason series (Dennis Eckersley first did it in the 1988 ALCS; since then, Greg Holland matched it in the 2014 ALCS), and setting a record for saves in the full postseason, with 7 (since then, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara, and Holland, share this record). He was awarded with the 1996 Rolaids Relief Man Award.

The Yankees allowed Wetteland to leave as a free agent due to the emergence of Mariano Rivera. He joined the Texas Rangers on December 16, 1996, signing a four-year contract worth $23 million. Before the 1999 season, Wetteland underwent elbow surgery. The surgery robbed him of some of his fastball speed, forcing him to expand his repertoire to include a slider, curveball, and change-up. Wetteland was again named to the All-Star team for the 1999 season, where he pitched a scoreless 9th inning, and became the first Rangers pitcher to earn an All-Star save. His 43 saves that year set a new Rangers record. His final game was on September 20, 2000, and he retired at age 33 after his Rangers contract expired during the 2000 offseason.

Wetteland was awarded the Rolaids Reliever of the Decade after earning the most saves of any pitcher during the 1990s. He is also the Rangers all-time saves leader with 150. His final win/loss percentage was .516, with 48 wins and 45 losses.

In 2005, Wetteland was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
The Washington Nationals hired Wetteland as their bullpen coach on January 27, 2006. However, on June 15, 2006, Wetteland was relieved of his duties due to a request from manager Frank Robinson, due to a &quot;long line of transgressions and insubordination&quot;. He was offered another position within the organization.

Wetteland was announced as the bullpen coach for the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. He served in this position until after the end of the 2010 season, when new manager Eric Wedge replaced him with Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers pitching coach Jaime Navarro.

== Personal life ==

Wetteland grew up in a log cabin in Sebastopol, California. His father, Ed, played baseball in the Chicago Cubs organization. Wetteland and his ex-wife Michele met while he was playing for San Antonio in 1988. Through his relationship with Michelle, who became a born-again Christian at age six, Wetteland also became born again. They separated in 2014. Their divorce by state decree was final in 2015. They have four children.

On May 18, 2007, Wetteland was introduced as an assistant baseball coach and bible teacher at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas.

On November 12, 2009, Wetteland was hospitalized for what was originally said to be a &quot;mental issue,&quot; in which a woman reported he was depressed and contemplating suicide. In subsequent statements upon Wetteland&#x27;s release the same night, Wetteland and the Seattle Mariners indicated that the cause of the hospitalization was &quot;because of an extremely high heart rate&quot; linked to high blood pressure.

On January 15, 2019, Wetteland was arrested in Texas on child sex abuse charges due to allegations of &quot;continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14.&quot; Wetteland was accused of abusing a male relative between the ages of four and six by forcing him to perform a sex act on Wetteland on three occasions, between October 2004 and October 2006. Wetteland was released from jail on $25,000 bond. A grand jury in Denton County, Texas indicted him on the charges in March. The trial started on August 29, 2022, and on September 2, 2022, a mistrial was declared after the jury became deadlocked. All charges were dropped on March 27, 2023, as the prosecution concluded a second trial was unlikely to result in a conviction.

<doc id="981289" wikidata="Q927964" url="?curid=981289" title="Keiji Muto">
<text>is a Japanese professional wrestling executive, actor and retired professional wrestler. He is known for his work under his real name and as his alter ego in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), as well as World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and during the 1980s and 1990s, and from his runs in other Japanese, American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican promotions. He was the president of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) from 2002 to 2013 and representative director of Wrestle-1 (W-1) from 2013 until its closure in 2020.

Considered one of the greatest and most influential wrestlers of all time, Muto is one of the first Japanese wrestlers (&quot;puroresura&quot;) to gain an international fanbase in the 1990s and beyond, thanks in large part to his Great Muta gimmick. The gimmick is one of the most influential in &quot;puroresu&quot;, emulated by many wrestlers, and seen as the most prevalent of Muto&#x27;s alter ego&#x27;s. Many wrestlers copied or modified some of the moves that he popularized or innovated, such as the &quot;Shining Wizard&quot;, &quot;Moonsault&quot; (also known as the &quot;Rounding Body Press&quot;), &quot;Muta Lock&quot;, and the &quot;Dragon-screw leg-whip&quot;. He took part in what was generally considered to be one of the bloodiest professional wrestling matches at the time against Hiroshi Hase, leading to the creation of the &quot;Muta scale&quot;, which rates the bloodiness of matches relative to this one&#x27;s 1.0 value.

Muto is one of the five wrestlers to win the three major championships of puroresu (AJPW&#x27;s Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, NJPW&#x27;s IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and Pro Wrestling Noah&#x27;s GHC Heavyweight Championship) with Kensuke Sasaki, Yoshihiro Takayama, Satoshi Kojima, and Yuji Nagata. He also held the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship, making him an overall nine-time world champion. He is also a 13-time world tag team champion with five AJPW World Tag Team Championships, six IWGP Tag Team Championships, one GHC Tag Team Championship, and one WCW World Tag Team Championship. In total, he held 32 championships throughout his 38 year career.

In 2013, Muto founded W-1, where he also wrestled semi-regularly. He made special appearances for the American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, renamed Impact Wrestling in 2017) from 2014 to 2019, as part of a talent exchange with W-1. In June 2022, Muto announced that he would retire in 2023. His retirement match occurred on February 21, 2023, in the Tokyo Dome during Noah&#x27;s Keiji Muto Grand Final Pro-Wrestling &quot;Last-Love&quot; event. In April 2023, Muto was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

==Professional wrestling career==
===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1984–1988)===
Muto was an accomplished amateur wrestler and a judo black belt with experience in many national competitions prior to being trained by Hiro Matsuda in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling Dojo. He debuted on October 5, 1984, against Masahiro Chono. In 1985, Muto was sent on his first learning excursion to the United States. Primarily wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida as the &quot;White Ninja&quot;, Muto teamed with Kendo Nagasaki. During his first excursion, Muto became a one-time NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion and a one-time NWA Southeastern United States Junior Heavyweight Champion. Muto returned to New Japan in 1986, where he was nicknamed &quot;Space Lone Wolf&quot;, a space-age type character that was briefly revived in 2005 by NOSAWA Rongai.

In March 1987, Muto won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Shiro Koshinaka, before losing the titles to Akira Maeda and Nobuhiko Takada six days later. In the summer of 1987, Muto took part in the NOW vs. NEW feud, in which he aligned himself with Antonio Inoki and his group, teaming with the likes of Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Kantaro Hoshino, and battling the likes of Tatsumi Fujinami, Riki Choshu, Akira Maeda, Kengo Kimura, and Super Strong Machine.

=== Capitol Sports Promotions (1988)===
In January 1988, Muto went on another excursion, this time in Puerto Rico for Capitol Sports Promotions under his new ring name, &quot;Super Black Ninja&quot;. He feuded with Miguel Perez Jr., with whom he lost a hair vs. hair match to that April. It was in Puerto Rico he formed the Three Musketeers with Masahiro Chono and Shinya Hashimoto. He wrestled only one match in New Japan during this period on July 29, before returning to Puerto Rico.

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1988–1989)===
In the fall of 1988, Muto moved to the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling, where he reunited with Kendo Nagasaki and had a feud with Kevin Von Erich before departing the organization in March 1989. Muto&#x27;s personality and ring skills shown in his early American matches earned him a high billing within the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA).

===World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990)===
Muto first appeared as &quot;Great Mota&quot; in the NWA&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling territory on the March 18, 1989, edition of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;. His manager Gary Hart introduced him as the son of the Great Kabuki, whom Gary Hart also had managed years earlier. He defeated Cougar Jay in his debut match. Muto&#x27;s name would eventually be changed to &quot;The Great Muta&quot;. Muta would feud with stars like Lex Luger, Ric Flair, and Sting, from whom he would capture the WCW World Television Championship on September 3, 1989. Muto eventually lost the championship to Arn Anderson on January 2, 1990, which aired on the January 12, 1990, edition of &quot;WCW Power Hour&quot;, and some time after the Clash of the Champions X on February 6, Muto would return to New Japan, going between his real name and his Muta gimmick as he pleased.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1990–2002)===

====Rise to prominence (1990–1992)====
Muto quickly rose in the ranks upon returning to New Japan Pro-Wrestling in March 1990. He made his in-ring return to NJPW on April 27 by teaming with Masahiro Chono to defeat Shinya Hashimoto and Masa Saito to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship, marking Muto&#x27;s second reign with the title. He and Chono would hold the titles for over six months, before finally losing them to Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki on November 1. During this time, Muto also entered the Kyushu Cup tournament on June 12, in which he defeated Chono to advance to the finals of the tournament, where he lost to Hashimoto. On September 7, Muto introduced his Great Muta moniker for the first time in NJPW during a match against Samurai Shiro, which Muto won. Muto would occasionally perform the Muta gimmick for major matches while competing under his real name for regular matches. On September 30, Muta picked up a huge win over Ricky Steamboat.

Muto revived his Great Muta moniker at the WCW and NJPW-jointly promoted Starrcade in Tokyo Dome event on March 21, 1991, where he defeated Sting. Later that year, Muto and Chono, along with Hashimoto, cemented their status as the next generation of New Japan, surpassing Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Riki Choshu, after the finals of the first G1 Climax tournament on August 11. He lost to Scott Norton but defeated Tatsumi Fujinami and Big Van Vader in his block to advance to the final against Chono, which turned out to be an epic thirty-minute match in which Muto was bested by Chono and, together with Hashimoto, the three celebrated in the ring, then afterwards they were officially labeled &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; of New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In October, Muto paired with Hiroshi Hase to participate in the 1991 Super Tag League, where they lost three of their tournament matches and won three, narrowly missing the chance to qualify for the knockout stage. However, shortly after the tournament, the duo found success as they defeated Rick Steiner and Scott Norton to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship at Budokan Hall on November 5.

On January 4, 1992, Muto headlined the Super Warriors in Tokyo Dome event as Great Muta by teaming with Sting for the first time ever to defeat The Steiner Brothers at the Tokyo Dome. This was the first January 4 Tokyo Dome Show, which would become the flagship event for NJPW in years to come. At the NJPW 20th Anniversary Show on March 1, Muto and Hase lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Big Van Vader and Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow. Muto continued to rise as a singles competitor, gaining his first title shot at the prestigious IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Riki Choshu on May 17, which he failed to win. Muto participated in the 1992 G1 Climax for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Barry Windham in the opening round in Shizuoka on August 6 and Steve Austin in the quarterfinals on August 10, before losing to the eventual winner Masahiro Chono in the semi-finals on August 11.

====IWGP Heavyweight Champion (1992–1996)====
On August 16, Muto donned his Great Muta persona to beat Japanese legend Riki Choshu to win the Greatest 18 Club Championship and the IWGP Heavyweight Championship for the first time, thus winning the first world championship of his professional wrestling career. He successfully defended both titles against Shinya Hashimoto on September 23 and then retired the Greatest 18 Club Championship to focus on defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. He successfully defended the title against Scott Norton on October 18 and Sting on November 22. On December 14, Muta faced Hiroshi Hase in a winning effort in a famous match where Hase used a foreign object to beat at Muta&#x27;s forehead, as payback for their previous encounters, including the September 14, 1990, encounter, in which Muta busted Hase open. Muta bladed and cut very deeply into his forehead. As a result of this, Muta bled profusely for the rest of the match, and to this day he still bears scars from where he sliced.

On January 4, 1993, Muta defeated Masahiro Chono in a title versus title match at Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome (known in North America as WCW/New Japan Supershow III) to retain the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, thus becoming the second of the only two men to hold both titles at the same time, the first being Tatsumi Fujinami. After losing the NWA title in WCW, Muta had a variety of challengers in title matches and exhibitions throughout the year. He lost to Hulk Hogan at Wrestling Dontaku in May and then successfully defended his IWGP title against The Great Kabuki on June 15. After holding the title for longer than a year, Muta finally lost the title to Shinya Hashimoto on September 20. Following this title loss and a match with Hogan against the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior) on September 23, Muto returned to fighting primarily under his real name, reviving the Muta name for certain matches. On December 10, Muto received a rematch against Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which he failed to win.

Muto resumed teaming with Hiroshi Hase in the fall of 1993 and the duo wrestled the Steiner Brothers in a losing effort at Battlefield on January 4, 1994. Muto reprised his Great Muta moniker for a dream match against the legendary Antonio Inoki at May&#x27;s Wrestling Dontaku, which Muta lost. In October, Muto and Hase entered the Super Grade Tag League, where they lost only two matches in the tournament, winning rest of their matches and scored fourteen points, thus advancing to the finals on October 30, where they defeated Masahiro Chono and Super Strong Machine to win the tournament, thus earning an IWGP Tag Team Championship opportunity against Hell Raisers on November 25, which Muto and Hase won, thus marking their second reign as a team and Muto&#x27;s fourth individual tag title reign. They successfully defended the titles against Steiner Brothers in their first title defense at Battle 7 on January 4, 1995.

On February 3, Muto lost to Scott Norton in a #1 contender&#x27;s match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. However, Muto received an opportunity for the title against Shinya Hashimoto at Wrestling Dontaku on May 3, where he defeated Hashimoto to capture his second IWGP Heavyweight Championship and subsequently vacated the IWGP Tag Team Championship three days later on May 6 to focus on defending the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Muto successfully defended the title against Hiroyoshi Tenzan on June 14 and Hawk Warrior on July 13, before winning the G1 Climax in August, beating Hashimoto in the finals to become the first of two men to win the G1 Climax as IWGP Heavyweight Champion as Kensuke Sasaki would achieve this feat in 2000. Muto held the IWGP title throughout the rest of the year. On September 25, Muto successfully defended the title against Junji Hirata. He would then lead New Japan in the opening battles of the feud with Nobuhiko Takada and the UWF-i army, defeating Takada in his fourth title defense on October 9. Muto closed the year with his fifth successful title defense against Shiro Koshinaka on December 11. Muto finally lost the title to Takada at Wrestling World on January 4, 1996.

====nWo Japan (1996–2000)====
The latter half of 1996 had Muto pitted against Masahiro Chono&#x27;s Ookami Gundan, which eventually blossomed into a war with the Chono-led nWo Japan. In the process, Muto began teasing at a possible turn to the side of the nWo, proclaiming himself to be the true successor to Antonio Inoki&#x27;s legacy, and &quot;accidentally&quot; attacking his own partners in the middle of a match. During this period, Muto underwent a long slump in big matches, losing not only to members of the nWo, but fellow New Japan wrestlers including Power Warrior at Wrestling World on January 4, 1997, and Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship on June 5. The turn was teased many times. Muto would even wear an nWo shirt only to proclaim days later that he refused to join Chono&#x27;s army. Muto further raised confusion by playing both sides of the feud; fighting as a member of New Japan under his real name, and as The Great Muta in nWo Japan, before being The Great Muta full-time for several months in 1997. The full turn came in September 1997, when Muto, after teasing a turn on his nWo teammates, double-crossed Kensuke Sasaki and Kazuo Yamazaki, sealing away the Muta name and formally joining nWo Japan as himself. Almost immediately following this, he and Chono dominated the tag team scene in NJPW, defeating Yamazaki and Sasaki for their second IWGP Tag Team Championship reign as a duo on October 19, and spray-painting the plates of the belts black as a show of disrespect for the championship&#x27;s legacy. They continued their dominance in the tag team division by winning the Super Grade Tag League by defeating Manabu Nakanishi and Shinya Hashimoto in the final on December 8.

On January 4, 1998, Muto headlined Final Power Hall in Tokyo Dome as he unsuccessfully challenged Kensuke Sasaki for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Muto and Chono were forced to vacate the IWGP Tag Team Championship on April 21, when Muto injured his knees, as his years of using the moonsault press were finally catching up to him. During this time, he took a hiatus from action, returning just before the 1998 G1 Climax, from which he was eliminated by Genichiro Tenryu in the first round. Despite his return, Muto was plagued by this nagging injury, fighting through his pain throughout the rest of 1998 and all of 1999. Towards the end of 1998, Muto took the leadership of nWo Japan, after Chono suffered a neck injury and was out of action, turning the nWo into a face stable. Muto would then team with teammate Satoshi Kojima as they won the Super Grade Tag League by defeating Shinya Hashimoto and Tatsumi Fujinami in the final on December 6.

At Wrestling World on January 4, 1999, Muto defeated one of Chono&#x27;s right-hand men, Scott Norton to win his third IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The following month, Masahiro Chono returned to NJPW and disagreed with Muto over Muto&#x27;s philosophy and leadership of the nWo Japan, thus leaving the group and Muto feuded with Chono for the name of the nWo, which evolved into a war between the nWo, led by Muto, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, and Satoshi Kojima and Chono&#x27;s new Team 2000 unit, with himself, Don Frye, Super J, and others from the old generation of the nWo. Muto successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kensuke Sasaki at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, Team 2000 member Don Frye at Strong Style Symphony, Genichiro Tenryu on May 5 and Satoshi Kojima on July 20.

In August, Muto entered the G1 Climax, where he lost only one match to Tatsumi Fujinami while winning the rest of his matches in the block thus qualifying to the final against Manabu Nakanishi, which he lost, leading to a match between Muto and Nakanishi for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Final Dome, where Muto retained. Muto revived Great Muta character at Jingu Climax on August 28 for a No Rope Explosive Barbed Wire Barricade Explosive Land Mine Double Hell Deathmatch against Great Nita, which Muta won. The following month, Muto entered the Super Grade Tag League with stablemate Scott Norton, which they won by defeating Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata in the final. On December 10, Muto finally lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Genichiro Tenryu. The war between Chono and Muto was lost by Muto at the 2000 Wrestling World event as he was defeated by Chono. Muto took an extended hiatus to rehabilitate his damaged knees after that, focusing instead on one last run in America for WCW, thus marking the dissolution of nWo Japan as it merged into Chono&#x27;s Team 2000.

====Bad Ass Translate Trading (2001–2002)====

After a planned tag team match with FMW&#x27;s Hayabusa for Wrestling World 2001 was cancelled due to Hayabusa&#x27;s injury to both his elbows that required reconstructive surgery, it seemed as if Muto reached a confusing crossroads in his career; however, he chose to completely change his image, shaving his head bald (he had a pronounced receding hairline throughout much of 2000), growing out a goatee, and aligning himself with a fellow NJPW wrestler who had gone overseas for an extended period of time, Shinjiro Otani. The two returned to New Japan on January 4, 2001, at Wrestling World, making short work of Manabu Nakanishi and Jushin Liger. Shortly after, Muto also began appearing for All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he debuted at King&#x27;s Road New Century by defeating Taiyō Kea. On February 18, Muto debuted his new trademark move, the Shining Wizard, to defeat Kazunari Murakami. Since its creation, it has become an extremely popular move on both sides of the Pacific, used by Muto&#x27;s allies, rivals, and fans of his work. Muto would begin appearing in both New Japan and on a part-time basis All Japan, which led to Muto creating a new stable with Don Frye and Shinjiro Otani which later came to be known as Bad Ass Translate Trading (BATT). Added to their ranks were Taiyō Kea of All Japan Pro Wrestling and Jinsei Shinzaki of Michinoku Pro Wrestling. Muto defeated AJPW&#x27;s veteran Toshiaki Kawada in a dream match at Champion Carnival One Night Special on April 14.

====Sporadic appearances (1990–1995)====
At Clash of the Champions XIII in November 1990, it was announced that The Great Muta would be returning to World Championship Wrestling at Starrcade &#x27;90: Collision Course the following month to team with Mr. Saito. At Starrcade, Muto teamed with Saito in the Pat O&#x27;Connor Memorial Tag-Team Tournament at Starrcade.

In May he returned again to WCW and began appearing on house shows in tag-team matches with Nikita Koloff against Big Van Vader and Rick Rude. He returned to television on the May 30 episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, defeating Brad Armstrong in a best of three contest.

====Dark Carnival (2000)====
After suffering a knee injury in early 2000, Muto took a hiatus from NJPW and returned to WCW in mid-2000 to team with Vampiro. Due to the bad booking and the decline of WCW in its last years, however, Muto could not recapture the previous popularity he had in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He returned to television on the July 11, 2000, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; and teamed with The Jung Dragons against Three Count and Tank Abbott.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2001–2013) ===

====Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion (2001–2003)====
Muto, as a member of New Japan Pro-Wrestling, made part-time appearances to All Japan in 2001, fighting Toshiaki Kawada and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams in major singles matches on pay-per-view. 2001 proved to be Muto&#x27;s year of renewal besides the formation of his BATT unit in New Japan, as he challenged, and defeated Genichiro Tenryu for All Japan&#x27;s coveted Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship on June 8. In Muto&#x27;s first title defense on July 14, Steve Williams lost to Muto for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship in a pay-per-view main event, where it ended in an altercation. After leaving the backstage area Williams would then going on a huge swearing tirade, where he kicked a trash can, was about to cry in tears, and then throwing his arm-pads to the ground while swearing again. Such scenes never happened in the traditional All Japan and was characteristic to the &quot;crash TV&quot; style of Vince Russo&#x27;s writing. This would ultimately lead Muto to a grudge feud with Williams into 2002.

On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year-long cross-promotional &quot;angle&quot; with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Keiji Muto shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Kashin with him. In his first match as an AJPW contracted wrestler, Muto and Taiyo Kea successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Mike Barton and Jim Steele on January 14. Muto would then lose the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to Toshiaki Kawada on February 24. Returning to his grudge feud with Steve Williams, Muto had a singles match against Williams on pay-per-view, which Williams ultimately won and got his revenge for losing the year prior. In April, Muto participated in the 2002 Champion Carnival, where he lost only two matches in his block while winning the rest of his matches and thus advancing to the knockout stage on April 10, where he defeated Satoshi Kojima in the semi-final and Mike Barton (Bart Gunn) in the final to win the tournament.

On July 17, Muto and Kea lost the World Tag Team Championship to KroniK.

At the Nippon Budokan on July 20, Muto wrestled as three different characters on the card: &quot;Kokushi Muso&quot;, defeating Kaz Hayashi on the second match, himself in a six-man tag team match in the mid-card, and in the second-to-last match, he defeated Satoshi Kojima, under his &quot;Great Koji&quot; persona, as The Great Muta. On September 30, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mokoto Baba officially announced Muto&#x27;s appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him. Despite this position, however, Muto continued to wrestle full-time for the promotion.

On June 8, Muto teamed with Arashi to participate in a tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, which they won by defeating Gigantes and The Gladiator in the semi-final and Jimmy Yang and Satoshi Kojima in the final. On July 13, Muto failed to become the #1 contender for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship by losing to Toshiaki Kawada. After successfully defending the tag team titles, Muto and Arashi entered the Real World Tag League but they failed to advance in the tournament. On December 27, Muto made a return to the United States, wrestling for the Ring of Honor promotion as part of an interpromotional &quot;All Japan vs. ROH&quot; card, which hosted a series of cross-promotional &quot;dream&quot; matches. In the main event, Muto reverted to his Great Muta persona and teamed with Arashi to defeat Prophecy members Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff. Muto and Arashi finally lost the tag titles to Kaz Hayashi and Satoshi Kojima on January 18, 2004.

Muto would then support AJPW in its feud with Roughly Obsess and Destroy and spent most part of the fall of 2003 and 2004 by competing in several matches against RO&amp;D members.

At the end of the year, Muto was paired with Toshiaki Kawada in the 2006 Real World Tag League, where they tied Satoshi Kojima and Hiroyoshi Tenzan with eight points in the round robin stage, which led to a match between the two teams on December 2 to determine the final round opponents for the top-ranked team in the tournament, RO&#x27;Z and Suwama.

In 2009, Muto took part in a tournament for the vacant All Asia Tag Team Championship by teaming with Kaz Hayashi, defeating Ryota Hama and Shuji Kondo in the quarter-final before losing to Minoru Suzuki and Nosawa Rongai in the semi-final. On March 14, Muto defended his Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against Yoshihiro Takayama. He bloodied him severely, as is his trademark, and even used the &quot;Shining Wizard&quot; to his opponent on the barricade. During the course of the match, however, his mask was ripped off, and he was bleeding profusely. Towards the end of the match, Takayama dominated Muta, but Muta reversed a kick into a Dragon Screw, and attempted to use the Asian Mist against him, but Takayama blocked it, and performed an Everest Suplex Pin on Muta, and won the match.

Muto frequently wrestled under two ring names: the first as Keiji Muto and the second, The Great Muta. Muto innovated the &quot;Muta Lock&quot;, named after him, and the &quot;Shining Wizard&quot;. He is also known for using the Figure-four leglock and the Moonsault as finishing moves as well as the Asian mist.

The Great Muta is Muto&#x27;s best-known gimmick, which he has wrestled as often throughout his career, switching back and forth between this alter ego and his real name since March 1989. He was originally billed as the son of Japanese wrestler Great Kabuki (unrelated in real life), who used a similar gimmick, but the connection is rarely mentioned nowadays. Like his father, Great Muta is a mysterious, manifestly supernatural character who distinguishes himself through his macabre looks and magical skills. His appearance is highlighted by his lavish, exotical entrance costumes, which are taken off to reveal a horrifically painted face, later replaced by an organic-looking mask after Muto shaved his head. Muta uses Muto&#x27;s moveset with little variation (his version of the &quot;Shining Wizard&quot; is named &quot;Senkou Youjutsu&quot; (&quot;Flash Magic&quot;) instead), though Muta tends to be much more aggressive and utilizes more weapons. Muta can also spit green or red mist and plays mind games to distract his opponents. The Great Muta is the gimmick most fans in the United States know Muto for, as he wrestled as The Great Muta throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s for the NWA, and in his later stints in World Championship Wrestling.

The gimmick was deeply expanded during the 2000s in the promotion Hustle, where he appeared in a storyline in which he gained a son in the form of The Great Bono (played by Muta&#x27;s wrestling trainee Akebono), forming a tag team reminiscence of Muta&#x27;s team with his own father Great Kabuki. Some of those elements were later used in All Japan Pro Wrestling as well. In November 2023, Pro Wrestling Noah introduced Muta&#x27;s storyline daughter, Great Sakuya.

Other portrayers of the Great Muta character were:
*Troy Endres (2002–2003): Endres, a professional wrestler and mixed martial artist, briefly used the Great Muta gimmick in New Japan Pro-Wrestling from 2002 to 2003. Endres died on August 3, 2014, at age 46.
*Johnny Stamboli (2004–2005): After being released by WWE, Stamboli worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling as the Great Muta from 2004 to 2005, where he feuded with Muto. In his penultimate match under the gimmick on December 5, 2004, Stamboli, as the Great Muta, lost a match to Muto&#x27;s version of the character. In 2007, Stamboli began portraying a new character &quot;Rellik&quot; (&quot;killer&quot; spelled backwards) in TNA, which was based on the Great Muta gimmick.

Kokushi-Muso, a gimmick used on special occasions, is a play-off of Jinsei Shinzaki&#x27;s mystic character Hakushi. Muto debuted it in Michinoku Pro Wrestling in 2001, but it later migrated with him to All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he used it when teaming with Shinzaki. &quot;Kokushi&quot; means &quot;Black Master&quot; in the same line &quot;Hakushi&quot; means &quot;White Master&quot;, while &quot;Muso&quot; means &quot;Unparalleled&quot;; together, they are a pun with the &quot;kokushi musou&quot; Japanese Mahjong yaku. Like Hakushi, Kokushi is characterized for sporting Buddhist shakyo painted all over his body, though interspersed with English phrases like Muto&#x27;s motto &quot;Puroresu Love&quot;, and wearing black garments instead of white. Similarly, he uses wrestling moves associated with Hakushi while at the same time retaining mannerisms and moves used by The Great Muta. He finally completes it with Buddhist monk paraphernalia like carrying an ojuzu and meditating in the ring.

White Ninja, a Japanese ninja gimmick, was used in Championship Wrestling from Florida between November 1985 and October 1986.

Super Black Ninja, a gimmick similar to that of the White Ninja, was used in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas and also was used in the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico, between January 1988 and March 1989. This was Muto&#x27;s first gimmick to sport face paint.

Space Lone Wolf, a space-age type character, was used in New Japan between October 1986 and December 1987. Space Lone Wolf&#x27;s entrance attire would feature the numbers &quot;610&quot; which means &quot;Muto&quot; in Japanese numerics. Muto had also stated that NJPW founder Antonio Inoki insisted on wearing a helmet to the ring in order to attract sponsorship from a Japanese motorcycle helmet manufacturer.

==Other media==
Muto has appeared in a vast number of media appearances in Japan, including many commercials and films. Muto was interviewed for wrestling documentary &quot;Bloodstained Memoirs&quot;.

In 1991, he made his video game debut in New Japan Pro-Wrestling: The Three Musketeers for the Game Boy handheld system in Japan.

In 1995, Muto starred in the Japanese thriller &quot;Yajuu Densetsu: Dragon Blue&quot;, as Ryusaki, a suave detective who joins forces with a beautiful young spiritualist named Mazuki (played by Hiroko Tanaka) to solve a bizarre case of killings from a mystical sea creature.

In 2000, he appeared in the video game Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.

In 2004, he played the role of Harold Sakata in the movie &quot;Rikidōzan&quot;, a film based on the real-life story of a wrestler who would eventually be known as the &quot;Father of Puroresu&quot;; Harold Sakata took Rikidozan under his wing and introduced him into the world of professional wrestling.

In 2006, he appeared as a guest star in the Japanese historical drama series &quot;Saiyūki&quot;, playing a village headman who is helped by Son Gokū (played by Shingo Katori).

Muto has worked extensively with Japanese clothing company A Bathing Ape, helping them to produce a number of t-shirts featuring his likeness and the All Japan Pro Wrestling logo. Muto was also responsible for organizing &quot;Bapesta Pro Wrestling&quot;, a previously annual wrestling event sponsored and promoted by Bape.

Muto appears as a gang member in the 2017 video game &quot;Yakuza Kiwami 2&quot;, alongside Genichiro Tenryu, Masahiro Chono, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami.

In 2024 Muto was added to &quot;WWE 2K24&quot; as part of the WCW pack DLC.
==Personal life==
In 1992, Muto married his wife, Hisae Ashida. Together they have two children.

Outside of professional wrestling, Muto also owns a yakiniku restaurant, opened in 2015, called &quot;Yakiniku Dining 610&quot; (焼肉Dining 610) which was inspired by Muto&#x27;s early &quot;Space Lone Wolf&quot; gimmick. In Japanese, the numbers 610 (which were featured on Lone Wolf&#x27;s entrance attire) can be read as &quot;Muto&quot;, lit. translated as &quot;Six-Ten&quot;.

<text>Saṅghamittā (Saṅghamitrā in Sanskrit, nun&#x27;s name Ayapali; 282 BC – 203 BC) was an Indian Buddhist nun and believed to be the eldest daughter (Sri Lankan Tradition) of Emperor Ashoka (304 BC – 232 BC) from his first wife Queen Devi (302 BCE – 242 BCE). Together with her brother Mahinda, she entered an order of Buddhist monks. The two siblings later went to Sri Lanka to spread the teachings of Buddha at the request of Sri Lankan King Devanampiya Tissa (250 BC – 210 BC) who was a contemporary of Ashoka. Ashoka was initially reluctant to send his daughter (Sri Lankan Tradition) on an overseas mission. However, because of the insistence of Sangamitta herself, he finally agreed. She was sent to Sri Lanka together with several other nuns to start the nun-lineage of Bhikkhunis (a fully ordained female Buddhist monastic) at the request of King Tissa to ordain queen Anulā and other women of Tissa&#x27;s court at Anuradhapura who desired to be ordained as nuns after Mahinda converted them to Buddhism.

After Sanghamittā’s contribution to the propagation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and her establishing the &quot;Bhikkhunī Sangha&quot; or &quot;Meheini Sasna&quot; (Order of Nuns) there, her name became synonymous with &quot;Buddhist Female Monastic Order of Theravāda Buddhism&quot; that was established not only in Sri Lanka but also in Burma, China and Thailand, in particular. The day the most revered tree, the Bodhi tree, a sapling of which was brought by her to Sri Lanka and planted in Anuradhapura, and which still survives, is also celebrated every year on the Full Moon day of December as &quot;Uduvapa Poya&quot; or &quot;Uposatha Poya&quot; and Sanghamittā Day by Theravāda Buddhists in Sri Lanka.

Sanghamitra is known for the proselytisation activity among women that she pursued as her lifetime goal in Sri Lanka, along with her brother, Mahendra (called Mahinda in Sri Lanka) at the initiation of her father, Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty who ruled in India in the 3rd century BC. Ashoka, after adopting Buddhism, took to spreading tenets of Buddhism in nine other countries of the region. His contemporary in Sri Lanka, King Devanampiya Tissa, in close alliance with Ashoka, saw the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

However, before deputing missions abroad in the region around India, Ashoka, in consultation with Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa convened a meeting of the Third Buddhist Council in which 1,000 Arahants participated. The purpose of this council meeting was not only to purge the Sangha of undesirable elements but also to take a view on the proselytisation of Buddhism. Moggaliputta presided over the Council meeting where it was decided to send nine delegations to different regions to spread Buddhism.

King Ashoka then sent out missionaries in nine different directions. The delegation that was sent south to Sri Lanka, at the request of Tissa, was led by Ashoka&#x27;s son Mahendra. Before taking the long journey, Mahendra sought blessings of his mother. The delegation (considered a diplomatic mission) comprised six other Arhats, namely Ittiya, Uttiya, Sambala, Bhaddasala, young Samanera (nephew of Mahendra) and a Bhanduka (also a cousin of Mahendra). All members of the mission belonged to the royal family, indicating the importance Ashoka attached to spreading Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

This was also considered an opportune moment to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka since Buddha himself had created awareness of his philosophy and precepts of Buddhism among the royalty and the common people during his three visits to Sri Lanka undertaken in the eight years following his enlightenment. Buddha, during his lifetime, had also created a social structure for the practice of Dhammavinaya or Dhamma (in Sanskrit: Dharma), which comprised the Sangha – order of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkunis (nuns) to preserve his teachings for posterity. However, it was only King Tissa, realising the poor status of the religion in his country, desired fresh efforts by a delegation from India.

Mahendra arrived with his delegation at Anuradhapura where King Tissa, accompanied by his sister-in-law (brother&#x27;s wife) Princess Anula with her entourage of 500 women, met him at the Mahamegha Garden. The Mahendra mission was very successful in introducing Buddhism to Sri Lanka. He established the Bhikkhu Order for men. However, thousands of women, starting with Anula, who had converted to Buddhism along with King Tissa, wished to be ordained into the Bhikkuni Order. Mahindra Thera expressed his inability to do so since this ordination had to be performed by a priestess or a Theri Arahat. He therefore advised the King to write to Emperor Ashoka and seek the services of his younger sister Theri Sangamitta, who was &quot;profoundly learned&quot;, to be deputed to Sri Lanka for the purpose. He also desired that a sapling of the right branch of the Bodhi Tree (where the Tathagata got his enlightenment) from Bodh Gaya should also be brought by her to Sri Lanka. King Tissa then chose his Minister Prince Arittha (his nephew) for the purpose since the minister had volunteered to go to India on the condition that on his return he would also be ordained into the Bhikkhu Sasana by Thera Mahindra. This was agreed.

==Early life==
Sangamitta&#x27;s parents were Emperor Ashoka and his first wife, Devi, who was a Buddhist. Her birth in 282 BC, as popularly known in published texts was as the second child of Ashoka and younger sister of brother Mahindra. She was born in Ujjeini (present day Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh in India). Her mother did not join Ashoka when he was crowned and her two children had embraced Buddhism. She was married at the age of 14 to Agribrahma, a nephew of Emperor Ashoka, who was also an Arhant. She had a son, Saamanera Sumana who also later became an Arhant and went along with his uncle Mahindra to Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism. Her teacher was Ayupala. She was ordained at the age of 18 into the Theravada Buddhism Order by their preceptor Dhammapala. Her brother was also ordained at the same time. With her dedicated perseverance to Dhamma she became an Arhant Theri and resided in Pataliputra (now known as Patna).

==Middle life==
Mahindra’s mission in Sri Lanka was very successful. Among his new converts was Princess Anula, King Tissa’s sister-in-law who became Sotapanna and requested ordination. King Tissa wrote to Emperor Ashoka to depute Sangamitta for the purpose. Mahindra also wrote to his father to depute his sister Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka as requested by King Tissa.

Following this invitation from the King and also the request made by his son Mahindra, Ashoka sent Sanghamitta with a retinue of 10 other learned bhikkunis (priestesses) to accompany her and to give ordination to Sri Lanka&#x27;s princess Anula and other women. Ashoka was initially distraught at the prospect of sending his daughter (Sri Lankan Tradition) away but Sangamitta herself persisted that she would like to go to Sri Lanka. She appealed to her father stating: The purpose was also to establish the Bhikkuni Order to spread Buddhism in that country with the devoted participation and assistance of women. Ashoka finally agreed to send her. She travelled to Sri Lanka by sea carrying a sapling of Bodhi-Tree in a golden vase. She landed at Jambukola in the North. King Tissa himself received Sangamitta and the sapling of the Bodhi Tree with deep veneration. They were then ceremonially escorted by the king and his people to Anuradhapura. They entered at the northern gate of Anuradhapura along a road sprinkled with white sand. The Bodhi sapling was planted with great fanfare in the Mahāmeghavana Grove in Anuradhapura. It is still seen at the same location.

In the Dipavamsa chronicle, the number of nuns who accompanied Sangamitta has been mentioned differently – three figures have been quoted but the figure of 11 including Sangamitta is inferred as the plausible number. The names of the young nuns who accompanied here on the ship were: Uttara, Hema, Pasadpala, Aggimitta, Dasika, Pheggu, Pabbata, Matta, Malla, and Dhammadasiya. In addition, the delegation headed by the Sri Lankan Ambassador Prince Athitha, which returned to Sri Lanka, comprised the Chief priestess Sangamitta and ten other priestesses, eight people of royal lineage of Magadha (Bogut, Sumitta, Sangot, Devgot, Damgot, Hirugot, Sisigot and Jutindhara), eight members of nobility (families of ministers), eight Brahmins, eight Vaishyas (traders), herdsmen, Hyaenna, Sparrow-hawk, Nagas, Yakkas, craftsmen, weavers, potters and many members of other castes.

A legend mentioned related to the journey of Sangamitta to Sri Lanka is that Nagas encircled the Bodhi tree. Sangamitta drove them away by assuming the form of Garuda (half-man half-bird form). Sanghamitta was 32 years of age when she took this journey. Her son Samanera was already in Sri Lanka as he had joined his uncle Mahindra&#x27;s mission to spread Buddhism. Sangamitta performed the formal &quot;Pabbajja&quot; ordination of Princess Anula. Anula was the first Sri Lankan woman to be ordained as a bhikkuni; concurrently her companions numbering more than 1000 who were also observing &quot;Dasa Sil&quot; were bestowed with &quot;Pabbajja&quot; ordination. This formally created the &quot;first ecclesiastical life of the Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka&quot;. The ordination covered not only the royalty but also common people of various strata of the society. She pursued every effort to enhance the status of women, with sustained devotion, dedication and diligence.

Sangamitta, on arrival at Anuradhapura, was put up initially at the Upasika Viharaya along with the bhikkunis who had accompanied her. An additional 12 buildings (ashramas) were built to accommodate the bhikkunis. Subsequently, the King also built a separate house for Sangamitta known as &#x27;Hathalakha-Vihara&#x27; acceding to the request of the nuns to reside in a secluded place where they could exclusively concentrate on devotional religious pursuits.

Dipavamsa, a chronicle written in 400 BC, records that after the Bhikkuni Sangha was established, there was a widespread following in the country among women of all ages and from all levels of society. The women who ordained were highly learned in the scriptures and they readily taught their knowledge of the Vinaya or rules of discipline to others.

===Bodhi tree and celebrations===

Sangamittā carried the right south branch of the Bodhi Tree (selected by Ashoka from the Maha Bodhi Tree in Gaya) on a ship to Anurādhapura, during the 12th year of Ashoka&#x27;s reign. The sapling was planted by Devānāmpiya Tissa in the Mahāmeghavana in Anuradhapura. It seems that &quot;the Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself&quot;. The journey route followed by Sangamitta who carried the tree branch was from Gayā to Pātaliputta and then to Tāmalittī in Bengal. Here, it was placed in a golden vase on the ship and transported to Jambukola across the sea. The entourage reached Anurādhapura, staying en route at Tivakka.

The planting of the Bodhi Tree was a grand ceremony performed by the king himself with assistance from the nobles of Kājaragāma, Candanagāma and Tivakka, in the presence of Sangamitta and her brother Mahindra. The tree took eight roots and yielded fruits and seeds. As fresh eight saplings emerged, they were moved and planted at Jambukola (present Colombogaon in north Sri Lanka), in the village of Tivakka, at Thūpārāmā, at Issaramanārāma, in the court of the Pathamacetiya, in Cetiyagiri, in Kājaragāma and Candanagāma.

The tree, as it stands, is on a raised mound. In 1907, it was in height with in girth. The tree and the shrine have been built around a compound wall measuring x and in height, primarily to protect the tree and the shrine built around it. Ten more trees of the same species are also seen within precincts of the enclosure. A damaged Buddha statue made of bricks (attributed to its creation during Tissa&#x27;s rule) is a marker to locate the main Bodhi Tree here. 32 more saplings, from four other fruits, were also planted in the near vicinity.

The Bodhi Tree at Anuradhapura was well tended by successive royal family members of Sri Lanka over the centuries, so much so that a village near Anurādhapura was also earmarked to provide for the maintenance of the tree.

A comment by Historian H. G. Wells on this oldest historical tree in the world, which is well-maintained states:

==Later life==
Sangamitta died in 203 BC at the age of 79 in the ninth year of the reign of King Uttiya at her residence in Hatthaloka Upasikaramaya Anuradhapura. Uttiya performed her last rites. The occasion was also marked with observances in her honour throughout Sri Lanka, for one week. She was cremated to the east of the Thūpārāma near the Cittasālā, in front of the Bodhi Tree. The location for the cremation had been selected by the Therī herself before her death. A stupa was erected by Uttiya over her ashes.

==Bhikkhuni Sangha==

The Bhikkhuni Sangha (a Dhamma-Vinaya heritage started by Buddha during his lifetime in India), locally known as &quot;Bhikkhuni Sasana&quot; or &quot;Meheini Sasna&quot; (Order of Priestesses or Nuns) was established by Sangamitta in Sri Lanka prospered for over 1000 years, till it disappeared in 1017 AD. The reason for such an end is attributed to the invasion of Cholas, Hindu rulers from South India, whereafter Bhikkhus and Bhikkunis were not seen in Sri Lanka for quite some years.

Bhikkuni ordination is the third and ultimate stage of the ordination of nuns; the earlier two stages are the &quot;sramanerika&quot; (novice) and &quot;siksamana&quot; (probationary). In India, the Bhikkuni Order was established by Buddha six years after the Bhikkhu Order was established, in the 6th century BC. It was spread to Sri Lanka by Sangamitta in the 3rd BC. Initially, with the spread of Buddhism in ancient India, 18 (eighteen) Vinaya schools developed. However, now only three are extant. These are the Theravada practiced in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia; the Dharmaguptaka that is practiced in Taiwan, China, Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines; and the third school is the Mulasarvastivada adopted in Tibet.

In 429 AD, Bhikkuni Devasara had realised that Bhikkuni Sanga, on account of war and famine, could vanish from Sri Lanka. She, therefore, had led a mission to China to establish the Bhikkuni Sasana. The original Theravada Bhikkuni lineage established in China since 429 AD has continued to function to this day. However, Asarana Sarana Saranankara Maha Thera re-introduced the Higher Ordination from Thailand. He is credited with re-establishing the Order of Monks in Sri Lanka in 1753 AD. It is now said that there are more than 400 Bhikkunis in the country.

In Thailand, the lineage is well established. A clay statue of Sanghamitta made by Dhammananda in 2002, is deified in a shrine room at Songdhammakalyani Monastery in Nakhonpathom. Her image is flanked by images of 13 Arahat Theris.

It is also reported that a few women from Western countries practising the Theravada tradition and a few women from Thailand have been ordained to bhikkuni order in Sri Lanka in recent years.

==Uduvapa Poya festival==
Unduvapa Poya festival is observed in Sri Lanka on the Full Moon of December to commemorate two specific events namely, Theri Sangamitta day of arrival from India to establish the Order of Nuns and to also mark her bringing a sapling of the sacred Bodhi-Tree from Bodh Gaya and planting it in Anuradhapura. The festival day has been designated as &quot;Sanghamitta Day&quot;. On this day, ten ordained nuns initiate the festive celebrations every year. This observance was revived in 1903 at the suggestion of the Mahabodhi Society of Sri Lanka.

This Observance is performed by Buddhists by first following the &#x27;Five Precepts&#x27;; bathing, shaving, wearing white robes, and kneeling with clean bare feet in a shrine before a Buddha statue. The kneeling and bowing are done the first three times with feet, hands, elbows, knees and head touching the floor. This is followed by reciting loudly the memorised prayers, with folded hands (palms at the heart). The prayers offered from sunrise until the next dawn starting with the words are: 

It is also a prayer offered on this day for the revival of Bhikkuni Sasana in Sri Lanka with the hope that it will flourish in the future. It is proposed that the day should also be celebrated as the International Women’s Day, as a mark of honour to Sangamitta who established the women&#x27;s Order.

<text>Bertrand Jean Gachot (; born 23 December 1962) is a Belgian and French former racing driver and businessman, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Gachot won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Mazda.

Born in Luxembourg City to a French father and German mother, Gachot began competitive kart racing aged 15 before attending the Winfield Racing School at Paul Ricard in 1983. Gachot enjoyed some success in the junior formulae, winning titles in Formula Ford before progressing through Formula 3 and Formula 3000, reaching Formula One in 1989.

After winning the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gachot was sentenced to 18 months in prison for an aggravated assault that had occurred the previous December. He was released after two months on appeal, but was replaced by debutant Michael Schumacher, Roberto Moreno and Alessandro Zanardi for the remainder of the season.

==Career==
Gachot was born in Luxembourg City on 23 December 1962, the son of a French European Commission official and a German mother. He began karting at the age of 15. In 1983 he attended the Winfield School, a racing driving school based at the Paul Ricard circuit where Gachot competed with fellow future F1 drivers Damon Hill, Jean Alesi, and Eric Bernard for the Volant Elf; a prize of a season in Formula Renault backed by Elf. Although Bernard won the lucrative prize, Gachot subsequently dropped out of university to focus on his racing career. In 1984 he competed in Formula Ford 1600, and finished third at the Formula Ford Festival, and then won the European series in 1985 driving for Pacific Racing. In 1986 he moved up to Formula Ford 2000 and had a fierce rivalry with Mark Blundell, with Gachot winning the British series and Blundell winning the European series.

Gachot joined the British Formula Three series in 1987, finishing second in the championship for the West Surrey Racing team behind Johnny Herbert. He switched to the Formula 3000 series in 1988, and met with some success, taking pole position at the Silverstone round, and finishing second to Roberto Moreno who went on to win the championship; Gachot finishing fifth in the final standings.

== Formula One ==

By this stage Gachot was considered one of the sport&#x27;s most promising young drivers. He was signed by the newly formed Onyx team, having played a role in attracting the team&#x27;s Moneytron sponsorship from businessman Jean-Pierre Van Rossem, and was partnered with the experienced Stefan Johansson. The team was well funded, but late in getting its car prepared. As a new entrant it was obliged to pre-qualify, and it was not until the French Grand Prix that Gachot made it onto the grid. He started 11th (two places ahead of Johansson) and ran in the points until battery problems dropped him to an eventual 13th and last. Despite qualifying for four of the next five events, he was then fired by van Rossem after complaining about his lack of testing time; his private grievances were publicly aired in an Onyx press release, and he was replaced with JJ Lehto. In early October he tested with Arrows at Silverstone, as he was being considered for a drive in 1990 which did not materialize. Gachot then found employment with the struggling Rial team for the final two races of the season, failing to qualify its ageing chassis for either race. The team folded over the winter.

1990 was initially more promising, as he switched to the Coloni team. The small Italian outfit had signed an exclusive deal with Subaru to use its new Carlo Chiti-designed and Motori Moderni-built 1235 flat-12 engine, and Gachot was selected to drive the sole entry. However, the engine was overweight and underpowered, resulting in a poorly-handling car that rarely ran for more than a few laps; he appeared to have little prospect of getting out of pre-qualifying. At the season opener in Phoenix, his gear selector rod broke on his first flying lap and he was unable to set a representative time. Subaru withdrew entirely after the British Grand Prix. After that the car ran with a Cosworth DFR engine, and performances improved; the withdrawal of Onyx ironically promoted Gachot to the main qualifying sessions, but the car still was not quick enough and he failed to make the grid all season.
Despite this, Gachot was still highly regarded, both as a driver and a marketeer, and was signed to lead the new Jordan Grand Prix team, sponsored by 7-Up and using Ford HB engines. The Gary Anderson-designed 191 was competitive, and after some initial reliability problems became a regular points-scorer; Gachot finished 5th in Canada and 6th twice. The season started off well as he gathered considerable acclaim for his Grand Prix performances, and also won the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans driving a Mazda 787B. He then set the fastest lap at the Hungarian Grand Prix after a late tyre change but his then fortunes took a dramatic turn.

===1991 prison sentence===
On 10 December 1990 Gachot was due to meet with Jordan and representatives of 7-Up but, on the way and running late, he became involved in a road rage incident with a taxi driver at Hyde Park Corner in London. His car collided with the back of the taxi, but caused no damage to either car. Later, Gachot said the taxi driver pulled him by the tie and raised his fist, at which point Gachot sprayed the taxi driver with CS gas to defend himself. Gachot hid the CS gas canister in a toilet cistern in a nearby building, and was arrested and charged with actual bodily harm (ABH) and possession of a prohibited weapon.

Gachot&#x27;s trial at Southwark Crown Court was scheduled the week before the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, a circuit where he expected the Jordan to &quot;fly&quot;. Gachot had claimed self-defence, and expected a fine or suspended sentence; he was due to test at Monza after the trial. Instead he was sentenced to 18 months in HMP Brixton and, later, HMP Northeye in Bexhill-on-Sea after an unsuccessful appeal.

The situation prompted a campaign of support organised by Belgian racing driver Pascal Witmeur. This campaign involved flags, T-shirts worn by members of the public and racing drivers, graffiti in several locations of the Spa-Francorchamps track during the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, and prominent sponsorship on Witmeur&#x27;s Formula 3000 car. Team owner Eddie Jordan replaced him with Michael Schumacher, whose performance at Spa led to a drive with Benetton. Gachot subsequently said that prison was &quot;a fantastic human experience&quot; and he had about 10,000 letters of support.

===Return to F1===
After two months in prison Gachot&#x27;s sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal and he was released. Having missed four Grands Prix, he returned to the F1 paddock at Suzuka to try and retake his Jordan seat from Alessandro Zanardi. The team refused, though Gachot found employment with Larrousse, replacing the injured Éric Bernard for the Australian Grand Prix. He failed to qualify the unfamiliar car, but impressed the team enough to be offered the seat for the following season.

The team ran a Robin Herd-designed Venturi chassis with V12 Lamborghini engines, but suffered reliability and financial problems throughout the season. Gachot and teammate Ukyo Katayama only managed 6 classified finishes between them from 31 starts, colliding with each other twice. Gachot scored the team&#x27;s only point of the year with 6th place at Monaco. He also finished 4th for Mazda at Le Mans.

1993 saw him out of Formula 1. He raced for Dick Simon Racing in CART, placing 12th at the Molson Indy Toronto in a one-off drive, and raced in Japanese touring car series for Honda while helping Keith Wiggins&#x27; Pacific team prepare to enter Formula One the following season. After becoming a shareholder in the team, Gachot was signed to drive as number 1 alongside pay driver Paul Belmondo for the 1994 season. The PR01 was initially designed as the car for Reynard&#x27;s proposed entry into the series, used 1992-spec Ilmor V10 engines and was not competitive. After Gachot outqualified Roland Ratzenberger to give the team its debut at the opening round, the Pacifics never again beat fellow newcomers Simtek to the grid; although a series of accidents in the sport led to several reduced entries and Gachot starting a further four races, he failed to finish any. While he had the upper hand over Belmondo after the Canadian Grand Prix, he did not make the grid again that season.
Gachot stayed with Pacific for 1995, with the new PR02 chassis, Cosworth ED engines and an influx of experienced personnel after a merger with the remains of Team Lotus. There were only 26 entrants; hence, he was a guaranteed starter, and the reliable package meant the car could at least finish races, though Gachot and teammate Andrea Montermini were largely left battling at the back of the grid. The team&#x27;s finances were tight, and Gachot stood down mid-season so that pay drivers Giovanni Lavaggi and Jean-Denis Délétraz could take his seat and bring some money to Pacific. After Délétraz&#x27;s sponsors defaulted on payments, the team planned to rent the drive to Formula Nippon driver Katsumi Yamamoto for the two races in Japan, but he was not granted a superlicence, so Gachot retook the seat. Gachot also intended to hand the car over to the team&#x27;s test driver Oliver Gavin for the season finale in Australia; however, the Englishman was also refused a superlicence and the Frenchman was forced back into the car, equalling the team&#x27;s best result with 8th place after much of the field had retired. It was Gachot&#x27;s final Grand Prix, for Pacific folded at the end of the season.

Gachot formed his own sports car team with the aim of participating in the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team entered a Welter Racing LM94 with factory support and engine from SsangYong, in what was a rare motorsport outing for the South Korean automotive manufacturer. The car participated in the pre-qualifying session but did not qualify for the race. It was again entered in the Coupes d&#x27;Automne Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest, a four-hour sports car race held at the Le Mans Bugatti circuit later in the 1996 season, where it qualified 3rd but did not finish.

Gachot later drove in occasional sports car and GT races for a variety of manufacturers and privateers.

==Business interests==
Following his F1 career Gachot began to develop his business portfolio, he signed a distribution agreement with Hype Energy Drinks in 1997. The company had been started in 1994 by the founder of Hard Rock Cafe, Brian Cox, and had been sponsoring motorsports including F1. Gachot had aimed to introduce the brand into France but by 2000 had taken a leadership role within Hype Energy; he began restructuring the company, simplifying the product portfolio, keeping only four flavours on the market. Growth had followed shortly after and by 2014 he was able to put Hype Energy back into the F1 Paddock with sponsorship of André Lotterer. 2015 saw Gachot come full circle as Hype Energy announced a sponsorship deal with Force India F1 Team, the team who had previously been Jordan F1 and for whom Gachot had raced. Gachot utilised this and other sponsorships to push the brand into new markets, announcing sales in the USA later that year. By 2017 Gachot had been pushing the brand further into the music industry, working with Migos, Mike WiLL Made It and Prince Royce. He still continues to fill the role of CEO at the company.

Gachot also owns F1i.com, a Formula 1 news site.

==Nationality==

Gachot raced under more than one flag during his career. He initially competed with a Belgian FIA Super Licence, despite carrying a French passport. From the 1992 season onwards he changed to a French licence.

Gachot is a supporter of the unification of Europe. In a 1991 interview, Gachot said that &quot;I am not really one nationality. I feel very much a European, but today I have to accept that a united Europe is not yet a reality. Certainly from a legal point of view.&quot; His helmet design features the circle of yellow stars on a blue background from the flag of Europe.

<text>James K. Gordon (born March 6, 1937) is a Canadian politician who served as mayor of Sudbury, Ontario from 1976 to 1981 and from 1991 to 2003, and as a Member of Provincial Parliament for the provincial electoral district of Sudbury from 1981 to 1987. He briefly served in the Executive Council of Ontario, holding the position of Minister of Government Services in 1985.

He is Sudbury&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, having served a total of 17 years. In 2000, the Canadian edition of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; named him one of the three most influential and innovative mayors in Canada.

== Early life and education ==

Gordon was born in Rouyn-Noranda in 1937 and grew up in Sudbury. He was part of the first graduating class of St. Charles College. During high school, he was president of the student council and hosted his own radio program, &quot;Time for Teens&quot;, Saturdays between 1951 and 1955 on CKSO radio in Sudbury. He competed in distance running, one and two mile, in track and field.

He earned a Bachelor of Arts in psychology at Assumption University in 1960. In his final year of university, he married Donna Drew. In 1961, they returned to Greater Sudbury, Ontario. In addition to CKSO Radio and Television, Gordon worked in sales for UPJOHN Pharmaceuticals and then became a secondary school teacher.

Jim and Donna Gordon raised six daughters and now have ten grandchildren.

==Teaching career==

Gordon taught English in the secondary school system in Greater Sudbury for four decades. He also held a specialist in Library Science and was responsible for the Resource Centre at Nickel District Secondary School for some of his tenure at the school. Gordon taught at the following secondary schools, returning to education at various junctures of his political career:
* St. Charles College – 1961 to 1965
* Espanola High School – 1965 to 1966
* Confederation High School – 1965 to 1968
* St. Charles College – 1968 to 1969
* Nickel District Secondary School – 1969 to 1976
* Sudbury Secondary School – 1988 to 1991

==Political career==
Gordon served on the town council of Espanola in 1965 before moving back to Sudbury. He ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Sudbury constituency in the 1967 election, but was not elected.

He was elected to Sudbury City Council in 1971, and became mayor in 1976. He served until 1981 and ran for a second time as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Sudbury in the 1981 provincial election. He won that election and served as a backbench supporter of Bill Davis&#x27;s government. Gordon supported Larry Grossman at the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s leadership convention of February 1985.

Gordon was a cabinet minister in the short-lived government of Frank Miller, serving as Minister of Government Services from May 17 to June 26, 1985, until Miller&#x27;s government was defeated by the Ontario Liberal Party sweep of David Peterson in the 1987 election. Gordon was defeated by Sterling Campbell in Sudbury.

In 1991, Gordon ran again as mayor of Sudbury, and defeated incumbent mayor Peter Wong. He served as the city&#x27;s mayor until 2000, when the city, the towns and the Regional Municipality of Sudbury were transitioned into the new city of Greater Sudbury through a transition board established by the Government of Ontario. He ran for mayor of the new amalgamated city in the 2000 municipal election, and won that election as well. Gordon&#x27;s tenure as mayor of Sudbury was marked by efforts to diversify the city&#x27;s mining-based economy. As the city&#x27;s provincial representative in the early 1980s, he was also a key supporter of the Science North project, which has since become the city&#x27;s and Northern Ontario&#x27;s most successful tourist attraction.

Gordon announced his retirement from politics in 2003.

== Mayor of City of Sudbury, 1976–1981 ==

===Fiscal Policy===
Gordon introduced zero-based budgeting to municipal budgets. The city was fiscally constrained in the 1970s. He would later use this policy as mayor in the 1990s to maintain zero increases in taxes.

===Development and housing===
Gordon worked with city council to encourage the private sector and the provincial government including John Rhodes (Minister of Housing at the time) to expand the supply of housing in Sudbury which resulted in many new homes, apartment developments and housing for the socially disadvantaged.

===Re-greening of Sudbury===
Gordon supported and worked with municipal leaders such as Tom Davies, chair of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, and other regional politicians in the creation of policies that established a successful re-greening effort that was eventually recognized by the United Nations for successful environmental land reclamation.

== Member of provincial parliament for Sudbury, 1981–1987 ==

===Northeast Cancer Centre (formerly Northeastern Regional Cancer Treatment Centre)===

In 1983, as parliamentary assistant to Minister of Health Larry Grossman, Gordon was able to secure a decision by the government to establish a cancer treatment centre in Sudbury, which now serves Northeastern Ontario. The development of a cancer centre allowed patients and families to remain closer to their homes in the north during treatment as well as making Sudbury a major medical centre within the northeast. The sophistication of the cancer treatment centre as both a treatment centre and an important research facility was one of the cornerstones Gordon was able to leverage in his pursuit of a medical school for Northern Ontario.

===Agency status for Science North===
Gordon was instrumental in getting the province of Ontario to agree to make Science North an agency of the province, thereby providing a solid base of operating funding for what is now Canada&#x27;s second-largest science centre.

===Development of mining machinery manufacturing===

Sudbury has always been a centre of resource extraction. INCO and Falconbridge Nickel Mines were the largest producers, but Gordon argued that, in addition to mining, the development of a mining machinery manufacturing industry would contribute greatly to the stability of the economy in Sudbury. To that end, he met with the provincial Minister of Industry, Gordon Walker. Walker agreed that the government would set up a Centre for Resource Machinery Technology, and he appointed as its members Jim Gordon (MPP for Sudbury), Mike Harris (MPP for Nipissing), Darryl Lake (Cambrian College), and Walter Curlook (vice-president of INCO for Ontario Operations, later President).

INCO became very interested in participating in this project because it would benefit both the company and the community, and through negotiations, eventually received a grant from the Ontario government. The mining machinery manufacturing company that was set up by INCO, now known as Continuous Mining, has since been purchased by Bob Lipic.

== Mayor of Sudbury and Greater Sudbury, 1991–2003 ==
During the 1990s Sudbury experienced a substantial loss of population along with stagnant municipal assessment. Recognizing the importance of diversification and development to the city&#x27;s survival, Gordon spearheaded specific major initiatives. Gordon worked with others at all levels of government and fostered a strong relationship with city council to achieve fiscal strength for the city and projects that would benefit the community and the Northeast.

===Northern Ontario Mayors&#x27; Coalition===
In 1992, Gordon tried to unite municipalities in Northern Ontario, with the cooperation of Thunder Bay mayor David Hamilton. Initially, he held a meeting in Thunder Bay in an effort to form an organization to lobby government. The outcome was that he and Hamilton spearheaded the organization of a coalition of mayors of the five largest cities in Northern Ontario (Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and North Bay).

This coalition gave the largest northern municipalities a unified voice in their dealings with the provincial and federal governments. This group, representing approximately 70 per cent of Northern Ontario&#x27;s population, worked for projects benefitting the whole of Northern Ontario.

Over time, this strategy proved effective in pursuing the establishment of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, which would train doctors to serve rural, northern and aboriginal communities, as well as other initiatives such as broadband infrastructure in Northern Ontario.

===Northern Ontario School of Medicine===
Gordon was a driving force in obtaining a medical school in response to the ongoing challenges of healthcare delivery in the north, in particular the shortage of doctors and the difficulties in providing effective healthcare for rural and aboriginal communities.

In 1999, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care appointed Dr. Robert McKendry to report on physician supply and demand in the province. The report gave weight to the view that &quot;the established medical schools had paid insufficient attention to preparing students for rural and northern practice&quot;. McKendry came to the conclusion that meeting underserviced areas&#x27; needs might best be met by building a new medical school.

In addition to the efforts being made by the university community and medical professionals in the north, Gordon realized that political initiative was required to put pressure on the government of Premier Mike Harris. To that end he arranged, on behalf of the Northern Ontario Mayors Coalition, a coalition of the mayors of the five major cities in the north, to meet with Health Minister Elizabeth Witmer to plead their case. Witmer agreed to have the government&#x27;s expert panel receive a proposal from the north, a proposal that laid out a model for an entirely new school.

However, the expert panel had other ideas, and on February 16, 2001, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; published a leaked report that the intention was that Sudbury, Thunder Bay and Windsor would become clinical education campuses, extensions of programmes at existing medical schools. Gordon had been quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s time for us, the councils in the north, to move politically on this,&quot; and when the April 2001 Speech from the Throne brought no announcement, Gordon arranged that the Northern Ontario Mayors&#x27; Coalition would meet with the Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Dan Newman.

Newman agreed to fund an international symposium in Sudbury. Experts from around the world, including Australia, New Mexico, and Finland attended, and on May 17, 2001, Tony Clement, the new Minister of Health, announced in Sudbury a new stand-alone medical school that would specialize in preparing students for northern, rural and remote practice. It would be the first medical school to be opened in Canada in over thirty years.

In October 2001, Harris came to Sudbury to name the implementation management committee with Gordon as chair. Its purpose was to develop a business and implementation plan for the school and to communicate with northern communities to establish a vision statement.

Gordon viewed the establishment of the medical school as his and the North&#x27;s major political achievement. It was the first time the entire North was united and achieved a project of this magnitude.

===Broadband infrastructure===
Gordon was the architect of the city&#x27;s telecommunications strategy, which included the building of broadband infrastructure to link health services, academic institutions, and municipal services, and nascent film industry, as well as attracting telecom industries such as call centres. Approximately 3,000 jobs were created in the technology sector between 1995 and 2000.

In 1998, he secured $1 million in funding from the provincial government to launch sureNet (Sudbury Regional Network), Sudbury&#x27;s fibre-optic communications network. Gordon was the founding chair of the sureNet consortium, which included partners such as health, education, municipal, and private groups.

===NetCentral===
In 1999, Gordon became the founding chairman of NetCentral, a not-for-profit corporation supported by the mayors of Sudbury, Chapleau, Parry Sound, Elliot Lake and Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands. The purpose of NetCentral was to develop a high-speed, high-capacity telecommunications network infrastructure to foster economic development, create jobs, and create better access to educational and health services in and among Northern Ontario communities.

NetCentral was incorporated in 1999 to develop a high-speed telecommunications network infrastructure for the following purposes: to connect communities, public agencies and organizations; to enhance access to educational and health services in northern communities; and to promote technology-oriented economic development and job creation in Northern Ontario.

As a result of Sudbury&#x27;s high-speed telecommunications network, Sudbury attracted companies such as Teletech and Canadian Blood Services, creating thousands of jobs for the region.

===Music and film industry support===
Gordon worked closely with the proponents of two major developments in the arts community over the past two decades: Music and Film in Motion, and Cinéfest.

Gordon provided encouragement and support through Greater Sudbury Development Corporation for the city&#x27;s first nationwide CBC television program, &quot;Chilly Beach&quot;. March Entertainment, the show&#x27;s creators, relied on the broadband network to do the back-office work for the program in Sudbury and the front-office work in Toronto.

===Northeastern Ontario Smart Growth Panel===
Gordon was a member of the Northeastern Ontario Smart Growth Panel appointed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. This panel was composed of leaders from industry, educational institutions, First Nations, community organizations and the municipal sector &quot;to develop recommendations for bringing increased prosperity and growth to northeastern Ontario&quot;. The provision of a tax incentive zone was one of many recommendations made by this panel.

===Fiscal Policy===

As mayor, Gordon worked with city council to establish a climate in which collaboration and co-operation were encouraged to find a way to hold the line on property taxes. The mayor worked in partnership with the city&#x27;s management and the unionized employees to use the zero-based budgeting process and to find millions of dollars in reductions in the city&#x27;s budget without layoffs. As a result, the city was able to hold the line on taxes. In 1994, Sudbury topped the list of local municipal efforts to control property taxes in Ontario, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (Members’ Opinions Survey #34, July 1994), a survey based on 8,058 face-to-face interviews with members from 18 communities.

===Local community initiatives===
Gordon strongly supported multicultural initiatives and associations in Sudbury throughout his career, including the Sudbury Multicultural and Folk Arts Association, an umbrella organization of 50 delegate groups with a client population of over 30,000 citizens of Sudbury. He attended numerous functions and provided guidance and assistance.

On the occasion of the official visit of Lieutenant Governor Hilary Weston on July 1, 2001, he received recognition from the multicultural community at the Canada Day celebrations. He has been made an honorary lifetime member of the Societa Caruso and was awarded the Gold Combatants Cross in recognition of his assistance to the Polish Combatants Association, an organization originally established by 5,000 Polish veterans who had fought with the Allies in World War II and who were allowed by the Canadian government to immigrate to Canada.

He lobbied, along with the original proponents Hélène Fontaine (now deceased) and Jacques Michaud, for the establishment of a French college in Sudbury, which is now Collège Boréal.

== Post-retirement community leadership, 2003–present ==

Since his retirement from politics, Gordon continues to serve as chair of NetCentral, a not-for-profit community-based network operating in Northern Ontario. He also served as chair of Parkside Older Adult Centre from 2010 to 2011, and as a member of the board from 2007 to 2011. In 2005, he served as honorary co-chair of the Sudbury Samaritan Centre, a facility designed to help residents in need including the homeless, with services that include a soup kitchen, drop-in mission, health centre and a support program to help people re-establish themselves in the community. He was a member of the board of Northern Artists Gallery/Artists on Elgin, a gallery which exhibits and sells work from northern artists and helps to market the local art industry to the surrounding community. He served as a member of the executive committee of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine from 2003 to 2011.

===Expert panel on health cluster development===

Gordon has chaired various committees in his tenure with the corporation. He chaired the health cluster development expert panel and led the committee through the exploration of several initiatives including the health impact of poverty, and a centre of excellence in occupational health and safety.

===Alternative Level of Care (ALC) crisis===

Gordon was appointed as chair and led the investigation of the ALC bed crisis at Sudbury Regional Hospital. He consulted with many groups including the Sudbury Physician&#x27;s Task Force, the North East Community Care Access Centre, the Sudbury Regional Hospital and the North East LHIN.

From these consultations, Gordon recommended 47 short-term and long-term measures to address the bed crisis. Based on his report, city council called on the Ontario government to adopt several measures to address the ALC crisis. City council also ratified Gordon&#x27;s recommendation to house ALC patients at another site.

===Regional Data Storage Project===
Gordon currently chairs the Regional Data Storage Project and has been in this role since April 2011. The primary objective of this project is to develop a regional data centre that will position Greater Sudbury to benefit from the economic potential of the growing need for secure data storage services.

<text>Wellesley Island is an island in Jefferson County, New York, the island is partially in the Town of Orleans and partially in the Town of Alexandria.

==History==
The island was named Wells Island but during his 1815 survey of the US-Canada border renamed by Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen to the current name to honor Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Several prominent points in and around the island were named after the Duke&#x27;s victorious battles. None of those names stuck. The large bay around which the island folds is called Lake of the Isles, not Lake Waterloo.

==Geography==
The island is located in the St. Lawrence River, which surrounds Wellesley Island on three sides. The island bounds an internal body of water, the Lake of the Isles, which nearly doubles its waterfront. The easternmost peninsula of the island lies across the Upper (American) Narrows from the Village of Alexandria Bay.
An arterial highway, Interstate 81, crosses Wellesley Island. Five segments composing the Thousand Islands International Bridge link the island to the opposite shores of the river. One of the bridges crosses a narrow channel, the International Rift, which separates Wellesley Island in the United States from Hill Island in the township of Leeds and the Thousand Islands, Ontario, Canada. The United States border-crossing facility at the port of entry is located on the northeastern part of the island.

Wellesley, one of the largest of the Thousand Islands in the St. Lawrence River. Population increases dramatically during the summer months. The island has two State Parks, a nature center, and three golf courses. Located on its southern tip is Thousand Island Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In addition to Interstate 81, which connects two portions of the Thousand Islands Bridge, Jefferson County Routes 100 and 191 serve the island.

==Geographic features==
*Barnett Marsh—A swamp in the south part of the island. 
*Densmore Bay—A bay on the south shore of the southeast peninsula. 
*Eel Bay—A large bay between Wellesley Island and Grindstone Island. 
*Lake of the Isles—A body of water connected to the St. Lawrence River, lying between the northeast and southeast peninsulas. 
*South Bay—A bay on the southwest part of the island.

==Communities on the island==

*Grandview 
*Moore Landing 
*Fineview 
*Thousand Island Park
*Westminster Park

==Parks on the island==
*Wellesley Island State Park—In several locations on the island.
*Dewolf Point State Park—Along Lake of the Isles on the southeast side of the northern peninsula. 
*Waterson Point State Park—On the northern edge of the island near the Canada–US border.
*Mary Island State Park—Not actually on Wellesley Island but accessible only by water, this park is separated by a small channel from the easternmost tip of Wellesley Island

<doc id="981321" wikidata="Q7190763" url="?curid=981321" title="Pickaway Plains">
<text>Pickaway Plains is a wide area of rolling hills beginning about 3 miles south of Circleville, Ohio, and extending several miles to the north and south. This geological area was formed by sand and gravel deposited by melting water from the last glacier to retreat from the region during the Ice Age. During the time of inhabitation by the Shawnee, the Pickaway Plains were covered by prairie vegetation, mainly grasses.

==Villages==
This area was inhabited most recently by the Shawnee, who founded at least three villages here:
* Cornstalk Town was located on the north bank of the Scippo Creek in Pickaway County, Ohio. It was just east of the present U.S. Highway 23 highway and approximately where Gold Cliff Park is today. The town was named for Cornstalk, a Shawnee chief.
* Grenadier Squaw Village was located opposite the Scippo Creek from Cornstalk Town. The town was named for Cornstalk&#x27;s sister Nonhelema, whom the British called the &quot;Grenadier Squaw&quot; because of her imposing stature.
* Kispoko Town &quot;was situated on the east bank of the [Scioto] river, across from the Pickaway Plains about midway between present day Circleville and Chillicothe. This town was peopled by the Chalahgawatha sect of the Shawnee tribe, one of five clans making up the Shawnee Nation. The principal Chiefs of this area were the legendary Chief Cornstalk (Hokolewqua) and his giant sister, Grenadier Squaw (non-hel-e-ma) who stood at six and a half feet tall.&quot; Tecumseh&#x27;s birth &quot;occurred while his parents, Shawnee war chief, Pucksinwah, and his wife, Methotasa, were en route from their village of Kispoko Town, on the Scioto River, to a major tribal council at the Shawnee tribal capital village of Chalahgawth (Chillicothe - now Oldtown), which was located &quot;two arrow flights&quot; northwest.&quot;
* Lower Shawneetown, also known as Shannoah, was relocated in 1758 from its original site at the confluence of the Ohio River and the Scioto, after Virginia militia launched an expedition to destroy it February, 1756 (the failed Sandy Creek Expedition). Some refugees from Logstown and from Upper Shawneetown were also invited to live there. The Shawnee referred to Pickaway Plains as &quot;Moguck.&quot;

==Dunmore&#x27;s War==
In 1774, the Shawnee and allied nations sent around 300-500 men from the Pickaway Plains area to meet Lord Dunmore&#x27;s army of Virginia militia. Lord Dunmore was attempting both to subdue the Shawnee and Mingo, and to prevent Pennsylvania from laying claim upon present-day Ohio. This conflict became known as Dunmore&#x27;s War. At Point Pleasant, West Virginia, Cornstalk and his army met a detachment of Dunmore&#x27;s army under command of Colonel Andrew Lewis.

The forces met on October 10, 1774, at what became known as the Battle of Point Pleasant. After several hours of intense fighting, Lewis&#x27;s detachment drove Cornstalk and his men northward, across the Ohio River. Dunmore then led his army in pursuit of the Shawnee.

Cornstalk and his men retreated to Pickaway Plains, with Dunmore&#x27;s army still in pursuit. As they reached the villages, Dunmore requested that Cornstalk discuss a peace treaty. Cornstalk agreed after he received word that Lewis&#x27;s detachment had destroyed several villages along the Ohio River. At the treaty, held at Camp Charlotte, Cornstalk agreed to honor the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, ceding the Shawnee hunting lands of present-day Kentucky to Virginia.

<text>Sarah Wynter (born 15 February 1973) is an Australian actress, known for her roles on American television – such as Kate Warner on the television drama &quot;24&quot;, as Beth on &quot;Windfall&quot;, and as Keitha on &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot;.

==Early life==
Wynter was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, the daughter of Helen Cummings, a worker in the Newcastle registry of the Family Court of Australia and lately author, and Stuart Wynter, a physician.

Her grandmother, Joy Cummings, was the Lord Mayor of Newcastle – Australia&#x27;s first female Lord Mayor. In 1984, her father killed his second wife and Sarah&#x27;s half-sister before killing himself.

==Career==
Wynter&#x27;s interest in acting led her to move to New York City when she was 17 to study drama.

===Television===
Wynter earned her SAG card by landing a role on the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; pilot, playing what she later summarized as the first woman to have sex on that show.

A few years later, she was recognised by SAG again, as part of the second-season cast of &quot;24&quot; when it earned a SAG Award nomination as Best Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Wynter played Kate Warner and appeared in all 24 episodes plus the third-season premiere, and she provided her voice for &quot;24: The Game&quot;. She had a recurring role in &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and starred in the series &quot;Windfall&quot; in 2006.

In 2009, Sarah appeared in &quot;Unnatural Love&quot;, an episode of the second season of &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot; as &quot;Keitha&quot;, the Australian girlfriend of Jemaine. In 2013 she played the role of Whitney Robshaw in &quot;Protest Too Much&quot; the 17th episode of the third season of the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. She signed on to &quot;Damages&quot; in a recurring role. She guest starred in the episode &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; in the first season of &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Californication&quot;. She also appears on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; Season 18 episode &quot;Motherly Love&quot;.

===Film===
Wynter&#x27;s first movie was &quot;Species II&quot; as the fiancée of the infected astronaut Patrick Ross. Wynter appeared in &quot;The 6th Day&quot; alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and &quot;Lost Souls&quot; with Winona Ryder as well as numerous independent movies such as &quot;Shooting Livien&quot;. Her Australian feature film debut &quot;Three Dollars&quot;, was released in 2005. She was also cast as Daisy Adair in &quot;Dead Like Me: Life After Death&quot;, the straight-to-DVD movie version of Showtime TV series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, replacing Laura Harris who had played her sister on &quot;24&quot;.

Australian director Bruce Beresford cast Wynter as the lead in &quot;Bride of the Wind&quot;, his ambitious 2001 biopic of Alma Mahler, the wife of composer Gustav Mahler (and, after Mahler&#x27;s death, of architect Walter Gropius and subsequently of writer Franz Werfel).

==Personal life==
On 20 August 2005, Wynter married &quot;Details&quot; magazine editor-in-chief Dan Peres in Sydney. The couple have three children. After struggling with infertility, her first son was born in 2008. After two attempts at IVF and a miscarriage, Wynter gave birth to twin boys in 2011. Following the birth of the twins, Wynter developed postpartum psychosis which took several years for her to recover from. Wynter and Peres divorced in 2014.

<text>UNITE HERE is a labor union in the United States and Canada with roughly 300,000 active members. The union&#x27;s members work predominantly in the hotel, food service, laundry, warehouse, and casino gaming industries. The union was formed in 2004 by the merger of Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees (UNITE) and Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE).
In 2005, UNITE HERE withdrew from the AFL–CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation, along with several other unions, including the Teamsters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the UFCW. In May 2009, union president Bruce Raynor (originally from UNITE) left UNITE HERE, taking with him numerous local unions and between 105,000 and 150,000 members, mostly garment workers and a labor-owned bank, Amalgamated Bank. They formed a new SEIU affiliate called Workers United.

On September 17, 2009, UNITE HERE announced that it would re-affiliate with the AFL–CIO.

==A merged new union==

Bruce Raynor, then president of UNITE, and John W. Wilhelm of HERE became close friends after meeting on a HERE picket line at Yale University in 2003. The two men quickly concluded that their unions should merge. UNITE HERE was formed in 2004 by the merger of UNITE (the Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees) and HERE (Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union). The impetus for the merger was that UNITE was wealthy but losing a significant number of members, while HERE had little cash but had a large number of organizing opportunities which could lead to hundreds of thousands of new members. The merged entity had 440,000 active members and about 400,000 retired members in both the United States and Canada. Raynor was elected general president of the merged union and Wilhelm was named president of the merged union&#x27;s hospitality division, but the two men shared executive, budgetary, and personnel duties.

In 2005, UNITE HERE withdrew from the AFL–CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation, along with several other unions, including the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Service Employees International Union, United Farm Workers, and United Food and Commercial Workers. UNITE HERE Vice-President Edgar Romney was elected the first secretary-treasurer of the new labor federation.

== Split and reaffiliation with AFL–CIO ==
The merger of UNITE and HERE faced initial difficulties due to disagreements between its leaders. By 2007, Raynor was accusing Wilhelm of stifling change, and Wilhelm was angry at Raynor&#x27;s &quot;heavy-handed&quot; managerial style. Raynor&#x27;s critics also said the union president often agreed to &quot;sweetheart deals&quot; that hurt workers but which added new members and avoided protracted organizing battles. According to at least one account, Raynor was unhappy that the HERE faction had a majority on the board, which permitted Wilhelm and his supporters to veto his proposals. Raynor allegedly began talking about a &quot;divorce&quot; of the two merged unions to precipitate just such an outcome.

In 2007 the union lost its bargaining certificate at Vancouver&#x27;s General Motors Place. The British Columbia Labour Relations Board conducted a vote to find the employees&#x27; preferred affiliation with the Christian Labour Association of Canada.

Significant conflict within the union emerged in early 2009. The union had 366,958 members at the end of 2008. In late 2008, General President Bruce Raynor and 15 local and regional UNITE HERE affiliates in the laundry and garment industries filed lawsuits against Hospitality Division President John Wilhelm, accusing him and his division of fraud, theft, gross mismanagement of $61 million in funds committed to union organizing drives, and failing to resolve members&#x27; grievances. Raynor also accused Wilhelm and his allies of attempting to impose their will on the executive board and the majority of members. Wilhelm and several affiliate leaders in the hospitality division sued Raynor and his allies in the laundry and garment division, claiming that Raynor had acted in violation of the union&#x27;s constitution and procedures in firing large numbers of Wilhelm supporters in Detroit and Phoenix, Arizona. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of disloyalty and dual unionism for continuing to press for the disaffiliation of the garment division affiliates after the UNITE HERE executive board had voted down the proposal.

By March 2009, the conflict had become unresolvable. On March 7, 2009, Raynor and his supporters held a disaffiliation referendum vote among the members in their affiliate unions in advance of UNITE HERE&#x27;s first quadrennial convention (set for summer 2009), and said that if they were successful, they would affiliate with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Wilhelm and his supporters said that the UNITE HERE constitution prevented any such vote without the permission of the international union&#x27;s executive board. Also at issue was control over Amalgamated Bank, which UNITE brought with it into the merger and whose ownership (and its substantial net worth) now belonged to UNITE HERE. Wilhelm sued Raynor and the 15 affiliates in February 2009 in US district court, but the court declined to prevent the vote.

The period before the vote led to more accusations of misconduct. Wilhelm and his supporters accused SEIU President Andrew Stern of supporting Raynor&#x27;s disaffiliation move, a charge Stern vigorously denied. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of supporting the disaffiliation effort only because he faced a difficult re-election bid, and of misusing union money and staff to support the secession effort. Raynor categorically denied all charges. Delegates from the 15 affiliates (representing 100,000 members) met in Philadelphia in late March, and on March 22, 2009, they voted to disaffiliate from UNITE HERE and establish a new union, Workers United. Workers United immediately affiliated with SEIU. Former UNITE HERE elected officer Edgar Romney was elected President of Workers United. Despite winning the disaffiliation vote, Raynor announced he would finish his term as General President of UNITE HERE rather than join Workers United—a move, one newspaper said, undertaken so that Workers United could gain control of the Amalgamated Bank.

UNITE HERE and Workers United began arguing over who had jurisdiction over various kinds of workers and how to divide UNITE HERE&#x27;s assets (most importantly, the bank). Wilhelm asked a federal court to give UNITE HERE control over all the union&#x27;s assets, but the court declined to issue a ruling at that time. Joseph T. Hansen, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), attempted to mediate a solution in mid-April, proposing (among other things) that UNITE HERE take jurisdiction over workers in the gaming industry and hotels; that Workers United take jurisdiction over workers in textiles and laundries; and that the two unions split organizing in food service. Hansen also suggested that Workers United keep the Amalgamated Bank and the former New York City headquarters of UNITE, but that Workers United make a multimillion-dollar payment to UNITE HERE to compensate it for the losses. Wilhelm rejected the offer. Andrew Stern then suggested that each union retain their existing casino workers, but that UNITE HERE have exclusive jurisdiction over casino workers in the future. Workers United would also pay UNITE HERE $20 million immediately and $46 million move within five years, if UNITE HERE would agree to turn the Amalgamated Bank and other of UNITE&#x27;s pre-merger assets over to Workers United. United States Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the dispute. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten urged the sides to settle as well, writing a letter to both Raynor and Wilhelm cautioning that &quot;This conflict is causing collateral damage. ... The longer it continues, the less likely we are to enact a strong Employee Free Choice Act.&quot;

Raynor did not finish his term. In April 2009, Wilhelm formally charged Raynor of using union resources to support the disaffiliation movement. Later that month, the UNITE HERE executive board gave Wilhelm the power to suspend Raynor as the union&#x27;s president, pending an investigation into Wilhelm&#x27;s charges. Wilhelm suspended Raynor on May 15. Raynor sued Wilhelm and UNITE HERE in federal court, arguing suspension was not permitted under the union&#x27;s constitution. At 4:00 AM on May 22, UNITE HERE&#x27;s executive board and John Wilhelm ordered security guards to secure Raynor&#x27;s New York City office and prevent Raynor and his allies from entering. Wilhelm said he acted to prevent the destruction of documents, and that Raynor&#x27;s staff had already removed hundreds of documents and scrubbed computer hard drives clean. Wilhelm told the press on May 28 that UNITE HERE staff had found documents showing that Raynor was receiving confidential updates about Workers United activities and finances even though he was still a UNITE HERE official, and that he had shifted millions of dollars of union assets to affiliates seeking disaffiliation. Juan Gonzalez, a columnist for &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, reported on June 16, 2009, that Raynor had transferred more than $12 million to affiliates which supported him as well as to groups outside the union. The transfers allegedly included:
* A January 31, 2009, transfer of $457,981 to The Organizing Group, a consulting firm founded by Steve Rosenthal (a close associate of former SEIU President Andrew Stern). The Organizing Group, the paper said, used the money to mail and call to UNITE HERE members and advocate for disaffiliation, and to set up a pro-disaffiliation Web site.
* About a dozen transfers totalling $11.2 million between January 26 and 31, 2009, to affiliates which supported Raynor and the disaffiliation movement. The affiliates then allegedly transferred the funds to an external group called Fund for the Future, which supported the disaffiliation effort.
* Another dozen transfers totaling $500,000 on March 6, 2009, were sent to supportive affiliates allegedly to reimburse them for expenditures.

According to internal union documents obtained by the newspaper, Raynor disbursed the money without the required approval from Wilhelm. Wilhelm also accused Raynor of absconding with the $23 million UNITE HERE strike fund (which was invested in the Amalgamated Bank), and investing another $333 million in long-term assets so that the union could not function. Raynor categorically denied the charges. Raynor sued Wilhelm and UNITE HERE, seeking an injunction, access to his office, and return of all property therein. The court declined the request for injunctive relief on May 26. An angry Raynor accused Wilhelm of removing his personal files from the office and resigned on May 30 mere hours before the start of the hearing on his suspension. Wilhelm was named General President of UNITE HERE after Raynor&#x27;s resignation. He was elected to the position at the union&#x27;s first quadrennial convention in July 2009.

Wilhelm subsequently accused SEIU of spending millions of dollars to convince more UNITE HERE members to disaffiliate and join Workers United. UNITE HERE retaliated by urging employers not to recognize or negotiate with the locals affiliated with Workers United or honor their dues checkoff agreements. Stern disputed the claim, saying SEIU was merely helping its affiliate regain textile workers still part of UNITE HERE, and that SEIU itself had a legitimate right to organize workers in food service. Stern also said on August 12, 2009, that the efforts had stopped. Nonetheless, UFCW President Joe Hansen continued to try to mediate a resolution, and expressed his hope that a settlement was possible. In July 2009, the presidents of 27 national unions signed a letter sent to Stern in which they announced their support of UNITE HERE and said they would help defend the union against any raid on its membership or incursion into its organizing jurisdiction.

The remaining 265,000 members of UNITE HERE reaffiliated with the AFL–CIO on September 17, 2009.

On July 25, 2010, SEIU and UNITE HERE announced they had resolved their 18-month-long dispute. As part of the agreement, ownership of the Amalgamated Bank will be transferred to Workers United (pending approval of federal banking regulators). UNITE HERE retained ownership of the union&#x27;s headquarters in New York City and an additional $75 million in assets. The agreement also settles a jurisdictional dispute over which workers the unions will organize. UNITE HERE agreed to restrict its organizing in the food service industry to those workers at airline caterers, airports, businesses, convention centers, and athletic stadiums, while SEIU and Workers United will restrict its organizing activity in the industry to food service workers in state and local government, health care facilities, and prisons. Both unions will continue to organize food service workers in elementary, middle, and secondary schools and in higher education. The two unions had also disagreed over whether several thousand members of Workers United had been given the opportunity to choose which union they wished to belong to. In the new agreement, SEIU and UNITE HERE agreed to let an arbitrator decide to which union the workers wished to belong. At least one analyst characterized the agreement as &quot;SEIU surrendered most of the assets of the venerable splinter union it had tried to absorb, and gave up some jurisdiction it had sought.&quot;

==Hands Off, Pants On==
Hands Off, Pants On is a campaign against sexual harassment in the hotel industry in Chicago. The campaign was led by UNITE HERE Local 1.

In 2016, the union surveyed about 500 hotel workers. It found that 58 percent of hotel employees and 77 percent of casino workers said they had been sexually harassed. 49 percent of housekeepers claimed to have been subject to indecent exposure. The survey was supposedly in response to a case where a waitress at Neil Bluhm&#x27;s Rivers Casino was pulled onto the lap of a guest and asked for oral sex.

UNITE HERE has proposed legislation that would ban hotel guests who have sexually harassed an employee. The union also supported requiring hotels to give &quot;panic buttons&quot; to any employees who work alone in guest rooms. Unionized hotels would be exempt from these rules.

==2018 Marriott strike==

UNITE HERE organized a multi-city strike against Marriott Hotels in fall 2018—the largest multi-city hotel workers&#x27; strike to date. Citing Marriott&#x27;s failure to negotiate key issues, 8,300 Marriott workers from across the US voted to authorize a strike in September 2018. Workers in San Francisco and Boston were the first to take action on October 3 and 4, followed by workers in San Diego, Oakland, Hawaii, Detroit and San Jose, affecting 23 hotels overall.

Workers struck for weeks, often in severe weather conditions, for better job security and living wages. While the specific demands varied from property to property, workers rallied around the idea that &quot;One job should be enough,&quot; with many citing a need to work two to three jobs in order to make ends meet.

Settlements began to be reached between Marriott and the various UNITE HERE locals in late November. The last contract was ratified in San Francisco on December 3, with 99.6% of the 2,500 local members voting in favor. Across the country, the newly-ratified contracts included significant increases to wages and other benefits, as well as stronger protections against sexual harassment in the workplace.

==2023-2024 Los Angeles hotel strike==
On July 2, 2023, UNITE HERE&#x27;s Local 11 chapter, which represents 15,000 workers at 61 hotels in the Los Angeles area, initiated a labor strike. The strike utilized the method of rolling strikes at various hotels throughout Southern California. By September 2023, the strike was reported to be the largest hotel strike in the history of Southern California. As of October 2023, the strike was still ongoing, with only four hotels securing a labor agreement by October 25. The strike continued into November 2023 as well. By January 2024, only 28 of the hotels affected by the strike had reached new labor agreements. By February 2024, 34 of the hotels targeted by the strike had reached new contract agreements. By August 2024, 68 hotels had reached new contract agreements. The Unite Here Local 11-led strike in the Los Angeles and Orange Country areas which occurred from 2023 to 2024 would achieve deals for worker in all but three of hotels which were targeted. 

==2024 nationwide hotel strike==

On September 1, 2024, more than 10,000 hotel workers at 24 hotels across the United States, ranging from Boston to Hawaii, who were UNITE HERE members began a labor strike. The strike started in nine cities. However, it would at first only remain ongoing in seven cities, with strikes at three hotels in the Seattle-area and the Hilton Baltimore in Baltimore only lasting one day. Over the Labor Day Weekend, a three day strike initiated by UNITE HERE Local 19 would also take place at San Jose&#x27;s Signia and DoubleTree hotels. On September 22, 2024, it was reported that workers at more hotels in San Jose and San Mateo County were on strike. On October 31, 2024, workers at five hotels in San Jose, including the Signia and Doubletree, who were UNITE HERE members would ratify new labor contracts.

By October 31, hotel workers in Baltimore, San Jose, Sacramento, San Diego, Greenwich and New Haven, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island, and Toronto, Canada were able to obtain new contracts. On September 24, 2024, 1,800 of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort
would participate in the strike. It was also reported that 5,000 of the 10,000 workers involved in the nationwide strike which began on September 1, 2024 were based in Hawaii and were members of the UNITE HERE Local 5 chapter. On November 4, 2024, the strike at Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort ended after the over 1,800 striking workers ratified a new labor contract. On November 12, 2024, 2,500 additional hotel workers who were UNITE HERE Local 5 members and who worked at the Hawaii-based Marriott-operated hotels Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Princess Kaiulani, Sheraton Waikiki, Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort, and the Westin Moana Surfrider ratified new labor contracts as well. Workers at Sheraton hotels in Maui would then ratify on new contract on November 13, while workers at Sheraton Kaua&#x27;i, who previous held a three day strike over 2024 Labor Day Weekend, would also ratify new labor contracts on November 14. With these ratifications, more than 5,000 UNITE HERE Local 5 members who worked at eight Hawaiian hotels, and who had initially still not settled their labor contract status, would all now have new labor contracts.

On October 6, 2024, UNITE HERE Local 26 members employed at the Hilton Boston Park Plaza and Hilton Boston Logan Airport Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts began an opened-ended strike which involves 24 hours a day, 7 days a week picketing. On October 7, it reported that this strike at the two Boston Hilton hotels, which involves 600 workers, would continue indefinitely, in contrast to some previous labor strikes in the city which only lasted a few days. On October 14, 2024, workers at two additional Boston hotels, Omni Parker House and Omni Boston Seaport, joined the strike as well. Unlike the three day strike which occurred at the two Boston Omni hotels in September 2024, UNITE HERE Local 26 pledged that the strike at all of the four Boston hotels would be indefinite and would not end until Hitlon and Omni and the workers could agree on a new contract. The October 20, 2024, the strike at the two Boston Omni hotels ended after workers unanimously voted to approve new contracts. 

By late October, four Hilton properties in Boston now had 765 workers who were on strike. The strike now included employees Hilton properties- DoubleTree Hilton Boston-Cambridge and Hampton Inn &amp; Homewood Suites Boston Seaport. Strike picketing at the four Boston Hilton hotels which had workers on strike ended on October 30, 2024 after workers ratified new contracts.
On October 20, 2024, workers at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco who were UNITE HERE members joined other San Francisco hotel workers in going on strike. It has been reported that 2,000 San Francisco hotel workers, including the 300 at the Palace where on strike. Other hotels in San Francisco which had workers who were on strike include Westin St. Francis and the Union Square based Grand Hyatt, Hilton and 
Marriott hotels, with all of the striking workers at these hotels being members of UNITE HERE&#x27;s San Francisco-based chapter.

On October 12, 2024, 400 hotel workers at two SeaTac, Washington hotels-DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Seattle Airport and Seattle Airport Hilton &amp; Conference Center- went on strike. The striking workers were members of the Seattle-based UNITE HERE Local 8 chapter, while both of the hotel were also run by Hilton. The two Seatac-based Hilton hotels were also previously among the three Seattle-area hotels targeted by the one day strike which occurred in September 2024. On November 10, 2024, the strike at the two SeaTac-based hotels concluded when workers ratified a new contract. The new contracts would then be ratified again on November 12.

On November 24, 2024, the number of UNITE HERE members striking at San Francisco-based hotels increased to about 2,500 when about 500 member of UNITE HERE Local 2 went on strike at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. As of December 2, 2024, the strike at the six San Francisco hotels which began on September 22, 2024 remains ongoing and was also affected 27.5% of San Francisco&#x27;s hotels. It was also reported that the strike at these hotels was now slated to last through the holidays, with planned Christmas events being cancelled. However, workers at all of the striking hotels in San Francisco would approve contracts would be approved before the month ended, with the Hilton being the last to approve on December 24, 2024.

==2024 LA Grand Hotel and LAX strike==
On February 13, 2024 food and beverage workers at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) who are members of UNITE HERE Local 11 would go on strike for a three day period. This was followed on February 14, 2024 with dozens of employees at Los Angeles Grand Hotel who were also members of UNITE HERE Local 11 also going on strike, demanding better wages and increased staffing.

<doc id="981340" wikidata="Q1323459" url="?curid=981340" title="Tatsunoko Production">
<text>and often shortened to , is a Japanese animation company. The studio&#x27;s name has a double meaning in Japanese: &quot;Tatsu&#x27;s child&quot; (Tatsu is a nickname for Tatsuo) and &quot;sea dragon&quot;, the inspiration for its seahorse logo.

Tatsunoko Production was established in 1962 and is engaged in the planning and production of anime films and television series, as well as character licensing.
The company produced many hit anime series from the 1960s through the 1980s, and holds numerous original rights and character copyrights for its original works in Japan and abroad.
The company is one of Japan&#x27;s leading anime studios in terms of the breadth and richness of its content, ranging from hard action heroes to comedies, science fiction, anthropomorphic animals, and domestic dramas.
Since the first work, &quot;Space Ace&quot;, they have produced many works such as &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, &quot;Hakushon Daimaō&quot;, &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot;, and &quot;the Time Bokan series&quot;, supporting the dawn of Japanese animation.
Although the company later began producing works set in Japan, it has basically aimed from its inception to produce works that can be used anywhere in the world in a stateless manner.

In the genealogy of animation studios in the history of Japanese animation, Tatsunoko is known as the studio that created many derivative studios along with Toei Doga (currently Toei Animation), Mushi Production, and Tokyo Movie (currently TMS Entertainment).

In the past, Tatsunoko had a production system in which almost all processes, from planning to scriptwriting, drawing, cinematography, and editing, were completed in-house. The company continued to use this system for a long time after Toei Doga and Mushi Production, which had a similar production system, became unsustainable due to streamlining and bankruptcy.

Initially, Founder Tatsuo Yoshida tried to establish his studio&#x27;s own style with realistic drawings that accurately depicted muscles and skeletons.
At that time, it was common knowledge that animation was to be abbreviated or deformed, and that pictures were to be simplified as much as possible to show movement.
Even Mushi Production and Disney used to draw the car so that when it starts, it first contracts like rubber and then jumps out like a bullet due to the recoil, and when it stops, it contracts once due to braking and then extends and returns to its original state.
However, Tatsuo Yoshida insisted on realistic animation and produced &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot;.
For the scene where the car spins, he rented a driving school and had the driver actually demonstrate the spin with the car, and had the animators draw the scene without deforming it by referring to the demonstration.
It was so well received that it became the studio&#x27;s origin and led to subsequent realistic, hard-action works.
However, Yoshida&#x27;s drawings, with their many lines, precision, and sharpness, were unsuitable for animation, which required many drawings of the same picture, and were difficult for other animators to imitate.
Most animators refused to participate in the production, and the company&#x27;s schedule was on the verge of collapse. However, the company was able to get through the busy season when a comedy with a simple design happened to enter the production rotation.
This allowed the company to learn how to run a studio that alternated between serious action animation with detailed drawings and comedy animation with simple drawings using deformation, resulting in a wide range of styles.

== History ==
The studio was founded in October 1962 by mangaka and anime pioneer Tatsuo Yoshida, and his two younger brothers, Kenji, who managed Tatsuo, and Toyoharu (better known by his pen name &quot;Ippei Kuri&quot;), a manga artist, at Tatsuo&#x27;s own house.
It initially began as a production company specializing in manga to manage the copyrights of Tatsuo Yoshida&#x27;s manga and his assistants.
However, at that time, the broadcast of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, Japan&#x27;s first domestically produced anime television series produced by Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Mushi Production, had just begun, and the manga artist community was abuzz.
Tatsuo Yoshida became interested in anime production after hearing from Hiroshi Sasagawa, a manga artist who had worked as Tezuka&#x27;s assistant, and Tatsunoko set out to produce anime.
Tatsuo saw that more and more people were buying televisions in the early 1960s and predicted that they would demand higher quality anime program in the future, so he decided to provide it to them.
Just around that time, Toei Doga, having heard of Tatsuo&#x27;s hopes, invited Tatsunoko to produce an anime TV series.
It was a good deal for Tatsunoko, which was entrusted with the original story, script, and direction, while Toei worked on the subsequent inbetweening, finishing, cinematography, etc., and Toei trained animators over a three-month period, with Tatsunoko staff, including Tatsuo and Sasagawa, also able to participate in training.
However, the negotiations broke down due to copyright issues, so Tatsunoko decided to produce an original work on its own. They bought a plot of land in Kokubunji, cleared out a wooded area, and built a prefab house, which became an improvised studio.
As for animators, Tatsunoko had three manga artists, Tatsuo, Kuri, and Sasagawa, and about 10 assistants to Tatsuo, so they were confident that they could manage, but most of them refused, saying that they wanted to be manga artists, not to make animation. Having no choice, Tatsunoko placed an advertisement in the newspaper looking for animators and trained 50 amateurs from all over the country based on their training experience at Toei.
In addition, art director Mitsuki Nakamura from Toei Doga and scriptwriter Jinzō Toriumi from Nikkatsu transferred to the company to provide immediate assistance.
Tatsunoko didn&#x27;t have any experience yet, so they produced a 15-minute pilot and pitched it to TV stations.

In 1965, Tatsunoko&#x27;s first TV anime series, &quot;Space Ace&quot;, began broadcasting.
The series became popular and successful. Tatsuo was so pleased with the success that he immediately began work on the next series.

In 1967, Tatsunoko&#x27;s second TV animation series &quot;Mach GoGoGo&quot; began broadcasting.
Not only was it repeatedly reran in Japan, but it was also exported overseas. In the U.S. in particular, it was broadcast under the title &quot;Speed Racer&quot; and became very popular, paving the way for syndication around the world.
This was Tatsunoko&#x27;s first full-color work.
At the time, color TVs were not widely available in Japan, and most households watched TV programs in black and white, but Tatsunoko dared to produce this series in full color, assuming from the start that it would be broadcast in the United States.
This was due to Tatsuo&#x27;s desire to move pictures like American comic books and create American-style animation, as well as for financial reasons.
The funds from commercial TV stations and sponsors were not enough to cover the production costs, so Tatsunoko decided that the only way to complete the series was to sell it in the United States. They chose car racing as their theme because their target the U.S. was a car society.
However, due to sloppy work by the Japanese intermediaries, Tatsunoko profited little from its worldwide success and received no tribute beyond a mention in the credits of a later live-action film.

In 1972, &quot;Science Ninja Team Gatchaman&quot; began broadcasting.
Tatsuo demanded thorough realism in the works he led. Although the results were excellent, the animators were reluctant to take on the next series because of the increased number of animation cells and the time and effort required to draw them. Tatsunoko therefore recruited and trained new animators and introduced them to this series.
The series was a huge hit and related merchandise sold well. Thanks to the copyright income, Tatsunoko was finally on track to recoup its production costs and make a profit. Therefore, from then on, Tatsunoko began to actively introduce mecha in its works for toy manufacturers.
Outside of Japan, independent TV program packager Sandy Frank has acquired the rights to syndicate &quot;Gatchaman&quot; worldwide except in Asia. He altered the series by cutting action scenes to meet U.S. broadcast codes, changing the dialogue to take advantage of the popularity of the then hit &quot;Star Wars&quot; and changing the setting of the work to outer space, and also changed the title to &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;. The series was broadcast in the U.S. and around the world, and he profited considerably from its merchandising. However, Tatsunoko did not profit from the series because they gave him the overseas copyrights.

In 1975, &quot;Time Bokan&quot;, the first of the &quot;Time Bokan series&quot;, began broadcasting. This series, which added an element of comedy to the action that had already become Tatsunoko&#x27;s signature, lasted for eight years and became a new Tatsunoko masterpiece.

At that time, Hiroshi Sasagawa, who excelled at comedies, and Hisayuki Toriumi, who had a hard, serious style, supported Tatsunoko&#x27;s heyday in the 1970s as the two signatures.
Also during this period, Tatsunoko was trying to bring up university-educated directors in-house, following the example of Toei Doga, instead of hiring directors from outside the company. Those were Mizuho Nishikubo, Kōichi Mashimo, Hidehito Ueda, and Mamoru Oshii.

On September 5, 1977, Tatsuo Yoshida died of liver cancer. Kenji Yoshida was appointed as the second president.

Around that time, Tatsunoko&#x27;s production site was on the verge of collapse due to busyness and lack of funds, and there was a steady flow of personnel out of the company, particularly members from the pioneering period.

In 1978, Tatsunoko Anime Technology Research Institute, an animator training institution, was established.

In 1982, Tatsunoko produced &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, the first in the Super Dimension series.
Macross was a project by Studio Nue that was adopted by Bigwest, an advertising agency, which secured broadcast slots for sponsor companies and commercial TV stations. However, Nue was not capable of producing animation, so Artland, which was headed by director Noboru Ishiguro, was assigned to produce the series. However, Artland, a subcontractor, was deemed insufficiently capable, and Tatsunoko took over as the prime contractor, placing orders with Artland and its own subsidiary, Anime Friend.
Later, however, Bigwest produced a sequel, &quot;Super Dimensional Fortress Macross II: Lovers Again&quot;, without Tatsunoko or Studio Nue, and in response, Tatsunoko signed a contract with Harmony Gold USA without the consent of Bigwest and Nue, resulting in a dispute over intellectual property rights.
In Japan, Tatsunoko sued Bigwest and Studio Nue over copyright and won, but conversely lost a lawsuit filed by them over character and mecha design. As a result of the trial, it was decided that Tatsunoko Productions would retain ownership of the film of the work, but that the designs would be shared by Bigwest and Studio Nue.
Meanwhile, overseas, Harmony Gold USA, which had obtained the license, adapted and broadcast several Tatsunoko works as a single epic &quot;Robotech series&quot; depicting different eras and generations in the same world.
Bigwest and Harmony Gold had different claims over the rights to the &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot; series for many years, and &quot;Macross&quot; was not developed for business worldwide and &quot;Robotech&quot; in Japan.
However, in 2021, the two companies announced an agreement regarding worldwide rights to the &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Robotech series&quot; from that point forward.
This will allow the &quot;Macross series&quot; to be developed globally and confirms that Bigwest does not object to the release of a live-action &quot;Robotech&quot; movie in Japan.
In addition, an exclusive worldwide license outside of Japan to use &quot;Macross&quot; characters and mecha in the &quot;Robotech series&quot; approved by Tatsunoko for Harmony Gold through 2021 has been ratified.

In 1987, Kenji Yoshida retired from Tatsunoko Production, and Ippei Kuri became the third president. Kenji established a new production company, Yū Entertainment.

In December of the same year, Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, together with the Tatsunoko Production Branch Office, which consisted mainly of staff who had participated in &quot;Zillion&quot;, became independent and established IG Tatsunoko Ltd. (now Production I.G).

In 1990, Tatsunoko Anime Technology Research Institute led by Koji Sugii became independent and participated in the establishment of Animation 21.

In 1995, Kenji Yoshida returned to Tatsunoko Production and became its first chairman.

Since the 1990s, Tatsunoko has brought back former key staff members, including Hiroshi Sasagawa, who had left the company, and has been producing mainly remakes of older works.

On June 3, 2005, major toy manufacturer Takara (now Takara Tomy) acquired 88% of Tatsunoko&#x27;s stock from the Yoshida family, making the company a subsidiary.
Accordingly, Chairman Kenji Yoshida and President Ippei Kuri resigned, and the entire Yoshida family, including executives, left the management of Tatsunoko Production.
In the same year, Tatsuo Yoshida was awarded the Special Achievement Award as one of the 20 People Who Made Japanese Animation at the Tokyo Anime Award held at the Tokyo International Anime Fair.
In 2010, Production I.G. acquired 11.2% of Tatsunoko&#x27;s outstanding shares. Additionally, Mitsuhisa Ishikawa, president of Production I.G and IG Port, becomes non-executive director of Tatsunoko Production.

In 2013, Horipro acquired 13.5% of the shares, making it the second largest shareholder (at the time) after Takara Tomy.
In the same year, the company changed its name from (written in kanji) to (written in katakana). At the same time, the head office was relocated from Kokubunji City, Tokyo to Musashino City, and the dispersed corporate functions were consolidated.

At Anime Expo 2013, Sentai Filmworks announced a deal to license and release some of Tatsunoko&#x27;s titles, including &quot;Gatchaman&quot; and &quot;Casshan&quot;.

In 2014, Nippon Television acquired 54.3% of the outstanding shares held by Takara Tomy and made Tatsunoko Production a subsidiary. Takara Tomy continued to hold a 20% stake in the company and maintained the partnership.

In 2019, Tatsunoko founded a new label, Bakken Record.
In the same year, four people associated with Tatsunoko received the Achievement Award at the Tokyo Anime Award: Kunio Okawara, Akiyoshi Sakai, Hisayuki Toriumi, and Tsuneo Ninomiya.

<doc id="981374" wikidata="Q3398887" url="?curid=981374" title="Ros na Rún">
<text>() is an Irish soap opera produced for the Irish-language television channel TG4. The series is set in a fictional village called Ros na Rún, located near to An Spidéal, where the series is filmed. It focuses on the domestic and professional lives of its residents.

&quot;Ros na Rún&quot; has been praised for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines, which got it dubbed &quot;the Wild West&quot;. It has dealt with many different storylines, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. The series is broadcast with English subtitles.

==Background==
&quot;Ros na Rún&quot; was originally devised by RTÉ producers Con Bushe and Antoine Ó Flatharta in response to the upcoming centenary of the Gaelic League, with the network deciding upon an Irish language drama as a contribution towards the commemoration of the event. The show originally transmitted on RTÉ One in 1992 as a pilot series of twelve minute episodes, though was subsequently discontinued. &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; was later revived as an expanded production for the network launch of Teilifís na Gaeilge (now TG4), first airing on the night of 3 November 1996. The episode filmed scenes in Galway, Dublin and London. The title plays on the double meaning of the Irish word &quot;rún&quot;, which has a basic meaning of &#x27;secret&#x27; but also has a long history as a term of endearment, similar to &quot;honey&quot;, &quot;sweetheart&quot;, or &quot;darling&quot;. &quot;Ros&quot; can mean either &quot;a wood or wooded headland&quot; or &quot;a headland or promontory&quot;, so the title can mean either &quot;Wood/Headland of the Secrets&quot; or &quot;Wood/Headland of the Sweethearts&quot;.

==Characters==
== Storylines ==
The show begins following the death of Old Jack Padráig, presumed to not have left behind a will. His niece Rita O’Connor prepares to move her family from Dublin into her uncle&#x27;s home in Ros na Rún only to find that her cousin Jack Hayes is already occupying the property, leading to a family dispute over its inheritance. Surrounding the circumstances of Old Jack&#x27;s death is seedy local publican Tadhg Ó Direáin, who Rita recalls being raped by on the night of her hen party seventeen years ago. Rita&#x27;s son Jason is devastated when he learns that Tadhg is his biological father, though the two later establish a relationship. Other early storylines include the O&#x27;Connor family struggling to settle into their new lives in Ros na Rún, along with the closure of the Mil Rí Chocolate Factory&#x27;s effect on the local job economy. Robbie Lynch deals with grief over the accidental death of his sister Yvonne, while Jack and his partner Tom Doherty face scrutiny as a gay couple as they attempt to start a local business and care for Tom&#x27;s infant nephew. An affair between Tom and veterinarian Owen Collins leads to the first on-screen gay kiss broadcast on TV in Ireland, which made headlines across the country. Berni Ní Neachtain marries her sweetheart Liam Ó Conghaile under dubious circumstances, but their marriage dissolves over Liam&#x27;s immaturity and her own reputation after her brother Andy attempts to rob Liam&#x27;s parents Peadar and Máire at gunpoint. Upon Liam&#x27;s departure, Berni learns that she is pregnant and struggles with becoming a single parent and postpartum depression after the birth of her son Evan. The town mourns the sudden death of Tadhg&#x27;s infant daughter, but he later discovers that the child was conceived through an affair between his wife Angela and employee Micheál Seoighe.

During the 2000s, Tadhg attempts revenge on Micheál by sabotaging his petrol pumps, but the act inadvertently kills Robbie and Seán Brennan and starts a chain of events that leads to Tadhg being forced to temporarily part with his share in the pub. The machinations of drug lord Jim O’Dowd destroys the lives of his wife Ríona De Búrca, her brother Donnacha, and his blackmailed associate Daniel McLoughlin. Micheál is incarcerated after he assists his cancer-stricken wife Pauline with euthanasia, but is later released with O’Dowd&#x27;s assistance. Following the death of her adopted father, local teenager Mo Gilmartin struggles to accept that Sergeant Úna Ní Riain is her birth mother. The mental deterioration of Berni&#x27;s fiancé Dr. Cathal Hennessy leads to his attempt to kill her in a murder-suicide, but she is rescued when Cathal is thwarted and killed by Evan. Tadhg is visited by his illegitimate son Eoin, possessing a vendetta that culminates into Eoin locking Tadhg inside a coffin and setting it ablaze. The show pays tribute to the character of series original Séamus Ó Catháin following the passing of actor Diarmuid Mac An Adhastair.

Following the show&#x27;s 20th season, Andy returns to the series attempting to extort money by kidnapping Tadhg and Frances&#x27;s daughter Áine for ransom and nearly strangles his estranged wife Bobbi-Lee to death, but is later acquitted by jury over lack of evidence. A major conflict between sisters Katy and Dee Daly begins when Dee discovers that her husband Mack Ó Riain is unwittingly the biological father of Katy&#x27;s child, occurring from a one-night stand that happened prior to their marriage. Dee takes desperate measures to hide the truth from Mack including becoming pregnant herself and undermining Katy&#x27;s sanity, with the storyline intended to highlight the effects of gaslighting upon its victims. When Mack discovers Dee&#x27;s deceit, she spites him by abducting their daughter and flees the country for over a year before returning to make amends. Burdened with guilt for her responsibility in Frances&#x27;s accidental death, Mo confesses her complicity to Tadhg and quietly departs Ros na Rún, causing strife with her estranged husband Colm Gallagher upon her return three years later. Berni suffers a tumultuous relationship with Briain McDonagh and becomes pregnant with his child after he forces himself upon her; Briain later returns to abduct his daughter and is ultimately killed at gunpoint by corrupt Garda Diana Ní Cheallaigh. When a deal by Diana is witnessed by radio reporter Sonia Ní Dhubhghaill, Diana attempts to silence her by pushing her from a roof and frames Mack for the attack, though discreetly assists his legal defense when the two become close. Pharmacist Cyril Harkin is disgraced after being revealed as a sexual predator and enters Tigh Thaidhg with a gun; the following skirmish results in the death of Niall Breathnach and trauma amongst the other participants. 

==&quot;Na Rúin&quot;==
On 13 September 2011, TG4 launched a ten-part online spinoff series, titled &quot;Na Rúin&quot; (&quot;The Secrets&quot;). The miniseries took on the theme of mystery, when 16-year-old Ciara goes missing. Lorcán finds himself in the frame for her murder, despite his protests of his innocence. The viewer had to read the blogs of Rachel, her roommate and Lorcán, as well as watch video diaries detailing the thoughts of each character about the disappearance to solve the mystery.

==Satire &amp; cameos==
In 2005, John Finn, Kathryn Morris and Jeremy Ratchford from &quot;Cold Case&quot; appeared in a satirical promo for both &quot;Cold Case&quot; and &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; for TG4. The commercial won a gold medal in the &quot;Best Drama Promos&quot; category of the 2007 Sharks International Advertising Awards Festival of Ireland (Sharks Awards). The promotion features both John Finn and Kathryn Morris in character interrogating a murder suspect from TG4 soap &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; played by Peadar Cox who refuses to speak in English, both detectives then begin talking in Irish much to the surprise of Jeremy Ratchford&#x27;s character, the promo tied in with a murder investigation in &quot;Ros na Rún&quot;. TG4 also ran a similar promo for Nip/Tuck, where Séamus is seen cycling through the country side supporting a brand new pair of breasts.

&quot;Ros na Rún&quot; has welcomed many special guests since its inception, including Daniel O’Donnell, Nathan Carter Francis Brennan and Stephen Fry. Most recently, U.S. talkshow host Conan O’Brien featured in a cameo where he played a balloon delivery man.

<doc id="981378" wikidata="Q12411558" url="?curid=981378" title="List of markets in London">
<text>This is a list of markets in London. Greater London is home to a wealth of covered, outdoor and street markets. Many specialise in a particular type of goods or sell different things on different days. Most open very early in the morning and close early or late afternoon.

Markets in London have their origins in the Middle Ages and ancient charter; set up to serve the population of the City of London. Over time, some emerged as wholesale markets serving specific market segments — such as the sale of vegetables, meat, or fish. With an expanding metropolis in the 18th and 19th centuries, street markets were set up to meet the needs of the new suburbs. With the introduction of trams on the streets of London, these were moved (sometimes forcibly) into neighbouring side streets, or new covered markets.

The modern markets are regulated by the City and 32 London boroughs. Many have become &#x27;general markets&#x27; proffering a range of goods.

==Wholesale markets==

These markets have ancient origins and connections with the City of London. Some have moved from their original locations within the city boundaries but most continue to be operated by the City of London Corporation:
*New Covent Garden Market is the largest fruit, vegetable and flower market in the UK. With over 200 businesses, employing over 2,500 people, the Market supplies 40% of the fresh fruit &amp; vegetables eaten outside of the home in London and is used by 75% of London florists. With a large range of food businesses, including traditional wholesalers, wholesale distributors and food processors, NCGM serves many of London&#x27;s best restaurants and hotels, cafés and bars, schools, hospitals and work places as well as independent retailers and street markets.
*Borough Market is located in The Borough, just south of London Bridge. The market was established on London Bridge and is first recorded in 1014. It has been in several locations, but moved to its present site in 1870. It was owned by the City Corporation and was transferred to an independent trust in 1999. It still operates as a wholesale market, but when this closes it sells a wide range of sundry food items.
*Old Billingsgate Market, a fish market, relocated in 1982 to Billingsgate Market, Poplar. The original elegant building facing the river is now used as a hospitality and events venue.
*Leadenhall Market, a food-centred market, continues to operate with many of the market spaces converted to retail outlets.
*Smithfield Market is a meat market that was originally a live cattle market.
*Spitalfields Market, a food market which relocated in 1991 to New Spitalfields Market, Leyton. The original market site is still used as a market selling fashion, art and design, food and vintage goods and is part of a revival of the surrounding area.

==Notable markets==

These are other wholesale markets and those popular with tourists, mainly in Central London:
*Bermondsey Market is located on Tower Bridge Road in Bermondsey, South London, and deals primarily with antiques, originally sold under the rules of &quot;market overt&quot;. Hours: 4am - 12 noon Friday.

*Broadway Market, Hackney, modern revival of ancient market (Saturdays).
*Brook Green Market and Kitchen, based at Addison Primary School in Brook Green, Kensington and Olympia, the market founded in 2014 is like a traditional Farmers Market but with certain innovative additions including Interactive Cookery Masterclasses, Live Music and craft alcohols.
*Camden Lock Market and several others comprise a complex often referred to simply as &quot;Camden Market&quot;. Camden Lock Market is close to Camden Town Tube station, and gets its name from its location at Camden Lock on Regent&#x27;s Canal in Camden Town, northwest London. All the markets sell general goods, music, collectables, military-surplus, jewellery, incense, clothing and a wide variety of fast-food.
*Camden Passage Market, on Islington High Street and Camden Passage, has its origins in the 1960s when small shop and stall holders banded together to form the market. Two markets deal in antiques and collectables. Wednesdays and Saturdays are good to visit for the antiques, Thursday is the book market, more recently fashion/accessories stalls come on Fridays and mixed craft/fashion/antiques on Sundays.

The two Spitalfields Markets are one of London&#x27;s busiest areas on Saturdays and Sundays with hundreds of market stalls specialising in fashion, art, crafts, design and food. The Markets are located in the original, historic Victorian Market Hall built in 1887.

<text>Frederick Ward Merriman (18 October 1818 – 21 July 1865), generally called Frederick Merriman, was a 19th-century New Zealand politician.

==Early life==
Merriman was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, on 18 October 1818. His father was the lawyer Thomas Merriman (1771–1841), and his mother was Mary Clarke (1780 – after 1837). He was their eleventh child out of a total of 14 (nine boys, five girls). He was educated at Winchester. He was admitted to the bar and emigrated to Auckland in New Zealand in 1844.

His brother Nathaniel later became Bishop of Grahamstown.

On 4 May 1850, he married Susannah Augusta Atkyns (née Greene) in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Auckland. She was the widow of Captain Ringrose Atkyns.

Merriman was a Freemason. He was initiated in the Ara Lodge in 1849 and became their treasurer.

==Professional career==
He commenced practice as a solicitor in the year of his arrival in Auckland. In 1856, he was joined by Samuel Jackson, and the firm became known as Merriman and Jackson. Upon Merriman&#x27;s death, the firm was joined by James Russell and was renamed Jackson Russell. It is still known by this name today.

From 1856 to 1861, Merriman was Provincial Land Officer for the Provincial Council. After that, he was Crown Solicitor until his death.

He was elected vice-president of Auckland&#x27;s first Law Society in 1860.

==Political career==


Merriman was appointed to the earlier Legislative Council (1841–1853) on 9 August 1847. That council was abolished in 1853 by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, but Merriman&#x27;s retirement date is not listed.

Merriman was elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament in 1853, representing the Suburbs of Auckland electorate, and was re-elected for the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. He resigned from Parliament on 13 March 1860. He was elected by the house as its first Chairman of Committees on 21 June 1854 and he held this role for all three sessions of the 1st Parliament.

He served on the second and third Auckland Provincial Council, representing the Suburbs of Auckland electorate. He was first elected on 26 October 1855 and served until 18 August 1857, the date of dissolution of the second council. He was re-elected on 7 October 1857 and served until 12 September 1861, the date of dissolution of the third council. He was twice on its executive council, first from December 1856 (no end date given) and then from February to July 1857.

==Death==
Merriman had been ill for four months when he died at his residence in Parnell on 21 July 1865. He was buried at the Symonds Street Cemetery the following day. His wife died in 1868.

<doc id="981402" wikidata="Q7714005" url="?curid=981402" title="The Appeal of Fascism">
<text>The Appeal of Fascism: A Study of Intellectuals and Fascism 1919–1945 is a 1971 book by the historian Alastair Hamilton, in which the author examines poets, philosophers, artists, and writers with fascist sympathies and convictions in Italy, Germany, France, and England. Hamilton deals nation by nation with the response of intellectuals to Fascism, as well as events like the rise of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, Nazi Germany, and the Second World War.

It was first published in London by Blond in 1971, then by Macmillan, in New York City, followed by a Discus Printing (Publisher: Avon).

==Reception==
In 2002, H.L. Wesseling wrote that &quot;The Appeal of Fascism&quot; &quot;is indeed an extensive but rather disappointing study because it is in fact more of an inventory of fascist writers than an analysis of their work or of the problem of writers and fascism.&quot;

However, in &quot;A Companion to Europe, 1900-1945&quot;, Gordon Martel said that &quot;The Appeal of Fascism&quot; is, &quot;despite its age, the most satisfactory overview of fascism&#x27;s attraction for intellectuals.&quot;

<text>Old Billingsgate Market is the name given to what is now a hospitality and events venue in the City of London, based in the Victorian building that was originally Billingsgate Fish Market, the world&#x27;s largest fish market in the 19th century.

The first Billingsgate Market building was constructed on Lower Thames Street in 1850 by the builder John Jay, and the fish market was moved off the streets into its new riverside building. This was demolished in around 1873 and replaced by an arcaded market hall designed by City architect Horace Jones and built by John Mowlem &amp; Co. in 1875, the building that still stands on the site today.

In 1982, the fish market itself was relocated to a new site on the Isle of Dogs in east London. The 1875 building was then refurbished by architect Richard Rogers, originally to provide office accommodation.

Now used as an events venue, it remains a major London landmark and a notable Grade II listed building.
