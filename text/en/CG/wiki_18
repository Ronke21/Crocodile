<text>An address is a collection of information, presented in a mostly fixed format, used to give the location of a building, apartment, or other structure or a plot of land, generally using political boundaries and street names as references, along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers and organization name. Some addresses also contain special codes, such as a postal code, to make identification easier and aid in the routing of mail.

Addresses provide a means of physically locating a building. They are used in identifying buildings as the end points of a postal system and as parameters in statistics collection, especially in census-taking and the insurance industry. Address formats are different in different places, and unlike latitude and longitude coordinates, there is no simple mapping from an address to a location.

== History ==

Until the 18th and 19th centuries, most houses and buildings were not numbered.
In London, one of the first recorded instances of a street being numbered was Prescot Street in Goodman’s Fields in 1708. Street naming and numbering began under the age of Enlightenment, also as part of campaigns for census and military conscription, such as in the dominions of Maria Theresa in the mid 18th century. Numbering allowed the efficient delivery of mail, as the postal system evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries to reach widespread usage.

In London, house numbering was not regulated until the Metropolitan Management Act 1855, which granted the newly formed Metropolitan Board of Works the power to control street naming and numbering. Under pressure from the Post Office, the board began simplifying addresses in 1857, tackling the most confusing streets and assigning district codes, like EC (Eastern Central) and WC (Western Central), which laid the foundation for the postcode system. Postcodes, as we know them, were only introduced in the 1960s-1970s. Despite some public resistance to changing street names and numbers, by 1871, over 4,800 street names had been altered, and 100,000 houses renumbered in London. Though house numbering took time to become widely accepted, it eventually became firmly established.

Comprehensive addressing of all buildings is still incomplete, even in developed countries. For example, the Navajo Nation in the United States was still assigning rural addresses as of 2015 and the lack of addresses can be used for voter disenfranchisement in the USA. In many cities in Asia, most minor streets were never named, and this is still the case today in much of Japan. Over a third of addresses in Ireland shared their address with at least one other property at the time of the Eircode&#x27;s introduction in 2015.

Land registration systems, known as Cadastres, helped manage property ownership in Ancient Rome, especially as Rome expanded. The city was divided into 14 regions (regiones) by Emperor Augustus to streamline administration, which became the foundation for locating properties.

== Current addressing schemes ==
=== House numbering or naming ===

In most English-speaking countries, the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in each direction along a street, with odd numbers on one side (often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road) and even numbers on the other side, although there is significant variation on this basic pattern. Many older towns and cities in the UK have &quot;up and down&quot; numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road, and then sequentially back down the other side. Cities in North America, particularly those planned on a grid plan, often incorporate block numbers, quadrants (explained below), and cardinal directions into their street numbers, so that in many such cities, addresses roughly follow a Cartesian coordinate system. Some other cities around the world have their own schemes.

Although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world, it is also common for houses in the United Kingdom and Ireland to be identified by name, rather than number, especially in villages. In these cases, the street name will usually follow the house name. Such an address might read: &quot;Smith Cottage, Frog Lane, Barchester, Barsetshire, BZ9 9BA&quot; or &quot;Dunroamin, Emo, Co. Laois, Ireland&quot; (fictional examples).

=== Quadrants ===
In cities with Cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems, the streets that form the north–south and east–west dividing lines constitute the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; axes of a Cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants. The quadrants are typically identified in the street names, although the manner of doing so varies from city to city. For example, in one city, all streets in the northeast quadrant may have &quot;NE&quot; prefixed or suffixed to their street names, while in another, the intersection of &quot;North&quot; Calvert Street and &quot;East&quot; 27th Street can be only in the northeast quadrant.

=== Street-naming conventions ===
Street names may follow a variety of themes. In many North American cities, such as San Francisco, USA, and Edmonton, Alberta and Vancouver, British Columbia, streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid. Numbered streets originated in the United States in Philadelphia by Thomas Holme who laid out the original plan for the city in 1683. Washington, D.C. has its numbered streets running north–south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east–west, while diagonal avenues are typically named after states. In Salt Lake City, and many other Utah cities, streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks. A similar system is in use in Detroit with the Mile Road System. In some housing developments in North America and elsewhere, street names may all follow the same theme (for example, bird species), or start with the same letter. Streets in Continental Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America are often named after famous people or significant dates.

=== Postal codes ===
Postal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing, designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality.

=== Postal alternatives to physical addresses ===
For privacy and other purposes, postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one&#x27;s physical address or even having a fixed physical address. Examples are post office boxes, service addresses and poste restante (general delivery).

== Address format ==

In most of the world, addresses are written in order from most specific to general, i.e. finest to coarsest information, starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit. For example:

In English-speaking countries, the postal code usually comes last. In much of Europe, the code precedes the town name, thus: &quot;1010 Lausanne&quot;. Sometimes, the ISO 3166 country code is placed in front of the postal code: &quot;CH-1010 Lausanne&quot;.

If a house number is provided, it is written on the same line as the street name; a house name is written on the previous line. When addresses are written inline, line breaks are replaced by commas. Conventions on the placing of house numbers differ: either before or after the street name. Similarly, there are differences in the placement of postal codes: in the UK, they are written on a separate line at the end of the address; in Australia, Canada and the United States, they usually appear immediately after the state or province, on the same line; in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and The Netherlands they appear before the city, on the same line.

East Asian addressing systems, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese addressing systems, when written in their native scripts, use the big-endian order, from the largest geographical area to the smallest geographical area, followed by the recipient&#x27;s name. However, both have the same order as western countries when written in the Latin script. The Hungarian system also goes from large to small units, except that the name of the addressee is put into the first line.

The Universal Postal Convention strongly recommends the following:

:&quot;The addressee&#x27;s address shall be worded in a precise and complete manner. It shall be written very legibly in roman letters and Arabic numerals. If other letters and numerals are used in the country of destination, it shall be recommended that the address be given also in these letters and numerals. The name of the place of destination and the name of the country of destination shall be written in capital letters together with the correct postcode number or delivery zone number or post office box number, if any. The name of the country of destination shall be written preferably in the language of the country of origin. To avoid any difficulty in the countries of transit, it is desirable for the name of the country of destination to be added in an internationally known language. Designated operators may recommend that, on items addressed to countries where the recommended position of the postcode is in front of the name of the location of destination, the postcode should be preceded by the EN ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code followed by a hyphen. This shall in no way detract from the requirement for the name of the destination country to be printed in full.&quot;

== Format by country and area ==
=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, an address must be mailed this way:
The postal code has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format, which is shown in the example. The new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning, which allows it to be identified. As the system has been changed recently, the four digit format can still be used: in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district.

=== Australia ===
In common with the rest of the English-speaking world, addresses in Australia put the street number—which may be a range—before the street name, and the placename before the postcode. Unlike addresses in most other comparable places, the city is not included in the address, but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used, usually referred to in Australia as a suburb or locality – although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries. Because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type, the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address. As an example, there are around 8,000 localities in Victoria (cf. List of localities in Victoria and List of Melbourne suburbs), yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes. For certain large volume receivers or post offices, the &quot;locality&quot; may be an institution or street name. It is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address (unless this happens to be the name of the suburb), and doing so may delay delivery.

Australia Post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters. In Australia, subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces; apartments, flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash (/) instead.

Apartment, flat and unit numbers, if necessary, are shown immediately prior to the street number (which might be a range), and, as noted above, are separated from the street number by a forward slash. These conventions can cause confusion. To clarify, &quot;3/17 Adam Street&quot; would mean Apartment 3 (before the slash) at 17 Adam Street (in the case of a residential address) or Unit 3 at 17 Adam St (in the case of a business park). On the other hand, &quot;3–17 Adam Street&quot; would specify a large building (or cluster of related buildings) occupying the lots spanning street numbers 3 to 17 on one side of Adam St (without specifying any particular place within the buildings). These forms can be combined, so &quot;3/5–9 Eve Street&quot; signifies Apartment 3 (before the slash) in a building which spans street numbers 5 to 9 on one side of Eve Street.

As in the US, the state/territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states/territories; it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated. In printed matter, the postcode follows after two spaces; in handwritten matter, the postcode should be written in the boxes provided.

In addition to PO Boxes, other delivery types (which are typically abbreviated) may include:

Australian Post Addressing Guidelines

In rural areas, &quot;Property numbers are worked out based on the distance from the start of the road to the entrance of the property. That distance (in metres) is divided by ten. Even numbers are on the right and odd numbers are on the left. For example: the entrance to a property 5,080 metres from the start of the road on the right hand side becomes number 508. The start of the road is determined as the fastest and safest road accessed from the nearest major road or town. Rural road maps are being drawn up to define the name, the start point and direction of every rural road.&quot;

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the address is generally formatted as follows:
The postal code always consists of four digits.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, the format used for rural and urban addresses is different.

Urban Addresses

The postal code always consists of four digits.

Rural Addresses
=== Belarus ===
In Belarus, some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don&#x27;t face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a &quot;main&quot; building may have the same number as one or more &quot;subsidiary&quot; buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as &quot;vul. Lenina, d. 123&quot; (&quot;123 Lenin St&quot;) An address may also cover one or more &quot;subsidiary buildings&quot; behind the main building, addressed as &quot;vul. Lenina, d. 123, bud. 2&quot; (&quot;123 Lenin St, unit 2&quot;, where &quot;bud.&quot; (abbreviation for ) means a &#x27;(subsidiary) building&#x27;). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that do not face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. &quot;123-а&quot;, &quot;123-б&quot;, etc., in Cyrillic alphabetical order.

In some &quot;microraion&quot; neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the &quot;microraion&quot; (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at &quot;4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56&quot;, i.e. &quot;123 – 4th Microraion, apt. 56&quot;.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (postcode and town for domestic mail or country for cross border mail.)
Spatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e. the line containing street, number and box number). If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.

The street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space. Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) or &quot;nº&quot;, or &quot;nr&quot; are not allowed. Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for &quot;box&quot; ( in Dutch, in French). Symbols such as &quot;b&quot;, &quot;Bt&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;/&quot; are not allowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element.

Examples of a correctly formatted postal address:

The Belgian addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union (UPU and see the link Universal Postal Union – Postal addressing systems in member countries). These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.

The complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Belgian postal operator (bpost). The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see bpost – Lettres &amp; cartes – Envoi – Comment addresser ? (in French)).
It is also possible to validate a Belgian postal address on bpost&#x27;s website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, an address must be written this way:
States can have their name written in full, abbreviated in some way, or totally abbreviated to two letters (SP = São Paulo, RJ = Rio de Janeiro, etc.).

Only towns with 60,000 inhabitants and above have postal codes individualized for streets, roads, avenues, etc. One street can have several postal codes (by odd/even numbers side or by segment). These postcodes range from -000 to -899. Other towns have only a generic postcode with the suffix -000. Recipients of bulk mail (large companies, condos, etc.) have specific postcodes, with a suffix ranging from -900 to -959. P.O. boxes are mailed to offices, with suffixes ranging from -970 to -979. Some rural settlements have community postboxes with suffix -990.

=== Bulgaria ===
Similar to Belgium and most other European countries, in Bulgaria the address starts with the most specific information (addressee individual identification) and ends with the most general information (town and postcode for domestic mail or country for cross border (international) mail.)
Spatial information of a physical address (including building, wing, stairwell, floor and door) may be useful for internal path of delivery, but is not allowed in the delivery point location line (i.e. the line containing street, number and box number). If needed, this information will appear on a line above the delivery point location line.

The street number is placed after the thoroughfare name (unlike in France), separated by a space and the symbol &#x27;No. &#x27;. Separators such as punctuation (point, comma or other signs) are allowed if needed. Extension designation (box numbers), if present, appears in the delivery point location line, preceded by the word for &quot;box&quot; (&quot; {numeral}&quot;, &quot; {numeral}&quot;, or &quot; {numeral}&quot;). Symbols such as &quot;#&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;/&quot; are not strictly disallowed as separators between the street number element and the box number element. Note that there may sometimes be a confusion between (, postal code (of the local post office)) and (, P.O. (post office box), the individual physical P.O. box of a specific address or a subscription-based physical P.O. box inside a post-office branch).
The convention is that the addressee&#x27;s information is written on the bottom right portion of the letter. The sender&#x27;s information is written either on the top left portion of the letter or on the top reverse side of the letter (except for parcel packages).
Domestic post letters, parcels and postal money transfers are written in Bulgarian Cyrillic while the international postal letters and parcels are written in the Latin script (usually in English due to its global usage) with Arabic numerals.

Apart delivering mail and parcel packages to individual addresses, the Bulgarian Posts also delivers to local post offices (which then notify the recipient that he/she has mail to collect from the post office; so-called (letters on demand/request)) or to a subscription mailbox within a local post office.

Examples of a correctly formatted postal address:

&quot;Format for mail exchange between private individuals (&quot;&quot;):&quot;
&quot;Format for mail and parcel exchange between business partners (&quot;&quot;):&quot;
&quot;Format for mail and parcel sending to an individual subscription mailbox within a local office of Bulgarian Posts (&quot;&quot;):&quot;
The Bulgarian postal addressing guidelines are registered with the Universal Postal Union (UPU and see the link Universal Postal Union – Postal addressing systems in member countries). These guidelines indicate exactly how to combine the various address components in order to obtain a correctly formatted postal address.

The complete set of addressing guidelines can be found on the website of the Bulgarian postal operator (Bulgarian Posts). The correct representation of an address is not limited to the correct structure of address components but also relates to the content of addresses and their position on envelopes (see Български пощи (Български пощи) (in Bulgarian)).
It is also possible to validate a Bulgarian postal address on Bulgarian Posts&#x27; website and to receive feedback on the content and the format of an address. More information can be found at (see Български пощи (in Bulgarian)).

=== Canada ===
Addressing guidelines can differ between English- and French-speaking populations in Canada. Here are some formatting rules that are used in common:

* Cardinal directions like &quot;North&quot;, &quot;North West&quot;, etc. can be abbreviated in either English or French, and appear after the street name. Ordinal numbered streets (e.g. 6th, 2nd) can be written in either English or French.
* If there is an apartment number it should be written before the house number and separated by a hyphen. 
* Name of city or town followed by two letter provincial abbreviations
* Postal codes come in a letter-number-letter-space-number-letter-number format, for example: A1A 1A1. There should be two spaces between the province abbreviation and the postal code.
* If sending a parcel from outside Canada, the word &quot;CANADA&quot; must be placed at the very bottom.

See the example below for a comparison of the English and French address formats:

English (from Canada Post):
 NICOLE MARTIN
 123 SHERBROOKE ST
 TORONTO ON L3R 9P6

French (from the OQLF):
 Monsieur Jean-Pierre Lamarre
 101–3485, rue de la Montagne
 Montréal (Québec) H3G 2A6

* See Canada Post&#x27;s Addressing Guidelines for accurate, up-to-date information on the addressing guidelines most commonly used in Canada.
* See the Office québécois de la langue française&#x27;s &quot;Adressage&quot; webpage (in French only) for more information about how to write an address according to guidelines used in Quebec and other French-speaking areas.

=== Chile ===
Chilean urban addresses require only the street name, house number, apartment number (if necessary) and municipality; however, more information is frequently included, such as commune (neighbourhood or town) and region. Postal codes are rarely included by people. All postal codes have seven digits, the first three indicating the municipality, the next four identifying a block or in large and scarcely populated areas a quadrant within the municipal territory.

The territories of most of the larger cities comprise several adjacent municipalities, so it is important to mention it.

Smaller cities often consist of only one municipality with several unofficial comunes (neighborhoods) that are usually mentioned even for official addressing purposes.

Several large and mostly rural municipalities contain more than one small town, in such cases, the recipient address must mention either the town, the postal code or both.
In other towns or rural communities there are no house numbers and addresses are generally identified by company name followed by only a street name follow by some reference point. 
=== China ===
In mainland China, the postal area when written in Chinese characters (preferably Simplified Chinese characters), has the big-endian order, which means that the Chinese-language address is written from the largest geographical area to the smallest geographical area. The Chinese-language address format is:

Province, prefecture-level city, district or county (sometimes omitted), &quot;township or town or subdistrict (often omitted)&quot;, &quot;village or community (usually omitted)&quot;, road name, road number, building name, floor/level, room number

However, as a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), China Post also supports UPU&#x27;s English-language address in the little-endian order, which means that English-language address is written from the smallest geographical area to the largest geographical area. The English-language address format is:

Room number, floor/level, building nameroad number, road name, &quot;village or community (usually omitted)&quot;, &quot;township or town or subdistrict (often omitted)&quot;district or county (sometimes omitted), prefecture-level citypostcode and provincecountry name

Chinese domestic letters only support Chinese-language address in the big-endian order. The example is:
The international letters to China support English-language address in the little-endian order. The example is:
=== Colombia ===
In Colombia the address format uses a numeric format based on which increase the number from south to north and which increase the number from east to west.

=== Croatia ===
Croatian Post recommends the following format:

Croatia uses five-digit postal code numbers. The Croatian postal service recommends using 2-letter ISO country codes as prefixes before international and domestic postal codes, though the practice is not mandatory.

=== Czech Republic ===
Common format in the Czech Republic:

Postal codes are in the format &quot;### ##&quot; (i.e. 158 00 = Prague 58) or &quot;CZ-#####&quot; (especially for international mail). On pre-printed Czech postcards and envelopes, the postal code is written on a separate last row in boxes for each number. If the envelope doesn&#x27;t have pre-printed rows and boxes, the postal code should be before the town (or post office) name.

On private letters, the first line is usually constituted by a courtesy title (...) For private mails addressed to the workplace, the order is (name + company), while in official mails it is (company + name).

The basic system of house numbering uses conscription house numbers (). For a temporary or recreational house, an evidentional house number ( or , or distinguished by initial 0 or E prefix) is used instead. In most larger cities and also in some towns and large villages with street names, there is a double system of house numbering. The first number is the conscription or evidentional number (which corresponds to the chronological order of cadastral registration of the house), and the second number (after a slash) is the orientational number () which expresses the position in the street. Sometimes only one of the two numbers is used, or the numbers are used in reverse order, and it can be difficult to distinguish which number is which. Generally, orientation numbers (if they exist) are preferred for mail services.

How to correctly address mail

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, apartment buildings will usually have two or three apartments per floor. Thus, if the addressee lives in an apartment, the address should contain the floor they live on, and a side ( or , meaning &quot;to the left&quot;, &quot;in the middle&quot; and &quot;to the right&quot;, respectively) or an alphanumeric character (1, 2, 3... or A, B, C...= starting from left seen from the top most step just before the floor).

Also, for postal codes 2000 and up, there is a 1:1 relationship between postal code and town.

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia, use the following format.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, if a person&#x27;s name is written before the company name in the address field of a letter, then that person is considered the recipient. In this case, no other employee is allowed to open the letter but the indicated recipient. If the company name is before the person&#x27;s name, then the company is the recipient and any employee is allowed to open the letter.

The apartment number can formatted as &quot; ( is an abbreviation for , apartment) or as &quot; (the letter indicates the correct staircase in apartment blocks with several entrances.)

Finland uses a five-digit postal code. Note that some larger companies and organizations have their own postal codes.

=== France ===
In France, the address is generally formatted as follows:
The postal code always consists of five digits. The is usually a town, but may be other territorial entities (up to a )

Organisations, government agencies, and companies which receive large amounts of mail often have a special CEDEX address which goes after the last line (for instance, &quot;75001 PARIS CEDEX&quot;).

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the address is generally formatted as follows:
* The postal code always consists of five digits.
* Organizations that receive large amounts of mail may be assigned a bulk customer postal code. These are different from regular postal codes in that they do not have a street name line. Some bulk customer postal codes are shared between several organizations.
* There are a few places that have house numbers but no street names (e.g. Baltrum) as well as addresses that have a street name but no house number.
* Some (but not all) private post companies are also able to deliver to Deutsche Post-operated P.O. boxes.
* Post codes follow the structure of DPAG&#x27;s mail routing, not administrative boundaries.
* Each post code is used exclusively for street addresses, P.O. boxes or bulk recipients.
* Sub-building information, such as apartment numbers, is rarely used—a name on the post box is usually the only method of identification of an addressee within a building.

=== Greece ===
Hellenic Post recommends the following format for Greek addresses:

The most widespread format, shown above, gives on the last line the recipient&#x27;s five-digit post code (with a single space between the third and fourth digits) and the name of the town or village that is the base of a post office, in capital letters and separated from the postcode by two spaces. When sending mail abroad, or when sending mail from abroad to Greece, Hellenic Post recommends the following format:

As with domestic mail, mail sent from abroad must contain the postcode in the same manner, but the postcode must be preceded by the international prefix of the country of delivery (for Greece, GR). Below the destination, the country of delivery must be written in capital letters, either in English or French (for Greece, or GREECE).

=== Hong Kong ===
The official languages of Hong Kong are Chinese and English. For domestic mail within Hong Kong, the address may be written entirely in either Chinese or English. For overseas mail going out from Hong Kong, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English. However, for an overseas mail from Hong Kong to mainland China, Macao, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Hong Kong, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Hong Kong&#x27;s postmen. Note that Hong Kong does not use any postal codes, though many rural properties have a property identification code, e.g. HKT-12345.

An address written in English should begin with the smallest unit and end with the largest unit, as in the following example for a domestic mail within Hong Kong.

An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Hong Kong. Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.

For mail to Hong Kong from overseas, &quot;Hong Kong&quot; should be added at the end of an address written in English, and should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.

=== Hungary ===
In Hungarian mail addresses, the city/town name precedes the street address. The post code then comes after the street address.

Hungarian family names precede given names in Hungarian. In this example, is the family name.

Sometimes a district number might appear after the name of the city/town.

Various abbreviations might appear in the precise street/building address: for instance, specifying the street type (, etc.), or for (floor), or for (which means Land Registry number, or lot number), or for (ground floor) and so on.

The postal code consists of four digits.

=== Iceland ===
In Iceland, the following format is used.

=== India ===
In India, multiple formats are used.

General Address
The format used for rural and urban addresses is different.

Rural Addresses
Urban Addresses
The state is optional in both cases, but is typically used.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, the address format is as follows:

Generally or means &#x27;street&#x27; and should be written before the street name, e.g. . For more about Indonesian administrative divisions, see administrative divisions of Indonesia.

=== Iran ===
Postal addresses in Iran have a standard which should be used by mail or parcel senders. This standard is registered and qualified by the Universal Postal Union (UPU). According to the below table, Iran has 4 types of standard address:

=== Iraq ===
In Iraq, the following format is used:

=== Ireland ===
In July 2015, the Republic of Ireland introduced Eircodes, a seven digit alphanumeric code, consisting of a 3 character routing key and a 4 character unique identifier for the property. Example A65 F4E2. Up until the introduction of Eircodes Dublin was the only county with a form of postal district identifier; these have been incorporated into the Eircode scheme. For example, Dublin 2 is routing code D02.

Rural addresses are specified by the county, nearest post town, and the townland. Urban addresses are specified by county, city or town name, street name, house number, and apartment or flat number where relevant. A house name may be used instead of a number. The Eircode is appended to the bottom of the address.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, the Universal Postal Union recommends the following:

In apartment buildings the building number should appear first and then the apartment number separated by a &quot;/&quot;. In the below example, &quot;16&quot; is the building number while &quot;20&quot; is the apartment number:

Example of common address with building entrance and apartment number:
Or
A seven digit postal code for all addresses was introduced in 2013 which can cover an entire locality for a small town or village. In bigger cities postal areas are divided along streets and neighbourhoods.

=== Italy ===
A domestic address in Italy must be composed of three to five rows. Up to six rows can be used for international mail:

Line ordering may not be changed.

=== Japan ===

A Japanese postal address, when written in Japanese phonetic and Chinese characters, starts with the largest geographical division, continues with progressively smaller subdivisions before ending with the addressee, i.e. country, prefecture, town, , , building number, building name, floor number, company name, addressee. This is the most common addressing format used when mailing within Japan. It is common practice to add the appropriate honorific to the addressee&#x27;s name, e.g. for a private individual or for a company or institution.

When written in the Latin alphabet, the address begins with the smallest geographical area and ends with the largest one as in the Anglicized example in the table. Macrons (as on ō and ū) may be omitted.

Japanese-style envelopes are vertically aligned and the address is written from top to bottom, then right to left. Western-style envelopes are horizontally aligned and the address is written from left to right, top to bottom.

=== Latvia ===
In Latvia, the address is generally formatted as follows:

Notes:

* Each address element should be written on a separate line, starting with the more detailed element.
* Including the addressee&#x27;s name is not mandatory and the address can be considered complete without it.
* In Latvian, the addressee&#x27;s name should be provided in the dative case, i.e., . There are two generally accepted official salutation forms that can be used in front of the addressee&#x27;s name: (with a man&#x27;s name) or (with a man&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s name).
* Indicate the full street name, house and flat number (if applicable). Separate house and flat number with a hyphen.
* It is acceptable to abbreviate the parish (, abbreviation of ) and amalgamated municipality (, abbreviation of ).
* The postal code consists of two capital letters (LV) and four digits separated with a hyphen.
* For international mail the destination country must be indicated in block letters.

=== Macao ===
The official languages of Macao are Cantonese and Portuguese. For domestic mail within Macau, the address may be written entirely in either Portuguese or Chinese. For overseas mail going out from Macau, the address may be written in the language of the destination country, provided that the city name and the country name are in English. However, for overseas mail from Macau to mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or Singapore, the address may be written entirely in Chinese. While traditional Chinese characters are commonly used in Macau, simplified Chinese characters are also understood by Macau&#x27;s postmen. Note that Macau does not use any postal codes.

An address written in Portuguese should begin with the street name and end with the area in Macau, as in the following example for domestic mail within Macau.

An address written in Chinese should begin with the largest unit and end with the smallest unit, as in the following example for a piece of domestic mail within Macau. Traditional Chinese characters are used in this example.

For mail to Macau from overseas, &quot;Macau&quot; should be added at the end of an address written in Portuguese, and &quot;Macao&quot; at the end of an address written in English; should be added at the beginning of an address written in Chinese.

=== Malaysia ===
Pos Malaysia recommends the following formats:

Notes:

* The Country line &quot;MALAYSIA&quot; is always omitted when mailing from within Malaysia.
* The State line is strictly optional, the mailing system will not be affected if the State line is omitted.
* The Post office/Mail centre field is the name of the town/city which post office/mail centre jurisdiction covers the mailing address, and in several cases, &quot;may not&quot; be the actual town/city which the address is geographically located.
* It is recommended to have the Post office/Mail centre written in block letters, e.g. &quot;KUALA LUMPUR&quot;.
* The postcode is always in the 5-digit format and must correspond to the respective post office / mail centre. 
* Pos Malaysia allows usage of P.O. Box for both residential and business addresses. Whenever a P.O. Box address is used, its respective postcode and post office/mail centre must be written on the &quot;last&quot; line of an address. If both postcodes are present (original and P.O. Box), mail will be sent to the P.O. Box on its first attempt.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, Correos de México recommends the following formats:

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, the address is generally formatted as follows:

The postal code is a unique street identifier, and always consists of four numbers followed by a space and then two capital letters. PostNL, which is appointed by the Dutch government to carry out the UPD (Dutch for &quot;Universal Postal Service&quot;), recommends putting two spaces between postal code and town. Also, the name of the town should be written in capitals.

Because the Dutch postal code uniquely identifies a street, a shortened format may also be used. This method only needs the postal code and the number. The ideal format for this method is the number after the postal code, meaning that this: &#x27;5627 BX 1092&#x27; will still get the letter delivered to the correct location.

It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. &quot;postbus 1200&quot;) or freepost number (e.g. &quot;antwoordnummer 150&quot;), which have their own postal code.
=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, New Zealand Post recommends the following format:

Note that no space or full stops exists between P and O in PO Box or R and D in RD. One should put only one space between the town/city and the postcode.

Note for Wellington metropolitan area, users should use the city name (i.e. Wellington, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Porirua), not the metropolitan area name. For example:

The city in this case is important, as if Wellington is used instead of Lower Hutt and the postcode is unclear (note only the first digit differs), someone&#x27;s private mail could accidentally be sent to the New Zealand Parliament Buildings instead (or vice versa).

One anomaly about this system is the Wellington Mail Centre, which is addressed as &quot;Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045&quot;, due to its location in the Lower Hutt suburb of Petone.

=== Norway ===
Postal addresses in Norway are formatted as follows:

The first line, &quot;Recipient (Person or Entity)&quot;, is the legal recipient of the item being sent. The Recipient&#x27;s name must be marked on the Recipient&#x27;s mail box in order for the item to be delivered.

Flat or floor number is not part of Norwegian postal addresses.

The postal code (always four digits) is mandatory. If a PO box is used (e.g. Postboks 250 Sentrum), it replaces &quot;Street name + Number&quot;. PO box addresses have postal codes which differ from those used for street addresses. Some areas do not have street names. For these areas, &quot;Street name + Number&quot; is replaced by a local designation determined by the Norwegian postal service.

=== Oman ===
In the Sultanate of Oman (2012), the address is formatted as follows:

Physical addresses only exist in major urban centers like those of Greater Muscat, Sohar, Salalah, Sur and Nizwa.

=== Pakistan ===
The format used in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Official Addresses
=== Peru ===
In Peru, addresses in the Metropolitan Area of Lima and Callao are generally formatted as follows:

Addresses elsewhere in the country are formatted as follows:

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines follows Western conventions on addressing. Addresses in the Philippines either uses these formats.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the address is generally formatted as follows:

ul. = Str (Street)
al. = Ave (Avenue)
pl. = Sq (Square, or Circus)

Some streets have names not containing the word &quot;street&quot;. Then the full description is written with initial caps, e.g. &quot;Zaułek Marii&quot; (&quot;Court of Mary&quot;) or &quot;Aleje Ujazdowskie&quot; (plural for &quot;Ujazdowskie Ave.&quot;). If the first word of name is &quot;Aleje&quot; it may be abbreviated to &quot;Al.&quot; (with initial capital).

The abbreviation &quot;m.&quot; (meaning &quot;mieszkanie&quot; = &quot;flat&quot;) can be used instead of &quot;/&quot; before the flat number.

Some large buildings occupy two or more cadastral plots. Sometimes to maintain consistency all numbers are included in address. The very well-known example is the address of Polish Radio Three: &quot;ul. Myśliwiecka 3/5/7&quot; (occupying three neighbouring plots). In examples like in above table the number &quot;4/6&quot; is ambiguous and not knowing the locality you cannot tell if &quot;6&quot; is the apartment number or the building is large.

When using a p.o. box the abbreviation &quot;skr. poczt.&quot; may be used and &quot;nr&quot; (&quot;no.&quot;) may be omitted. Polish Post allows the box user to register an alias for their name. In such case it is written instead of the real name of the recipient. It is required to write the full name of post office including a number if it exists.

The postal code always consists of five digits separated with a hyphen (in the &quot;XX-XXX&quot; format), i.e. 00-486 (00 = Warsaw); 20-486 (20 = Lublin), etc. The first digit signifies the postal district, the second: the code zone, the third: the code sector, the fourth and fifth signify the post office and its area of operation. Usually the code is unique on the street level for cities and the town level for smaller towns and villages. Contrary to popular belief the name after postal code is a locality of addressee, not their post office. So if a small town has no street names you do write its name twice. The post office location (and a number if there are many) is written only on letters to p.o. box or &quot;poste restante&quot;.

There is a strong recommendation to use all caps in the line with postal code and city.

=== Portugal ===
Portuguese postal addresses is similar to continental European addresses:

Postal codes have the codice_1 format. Street name and the number is traditionally separated by a comma, but nowadays CTT recommends just a blank space, or two blank spaces for extra clarity; this is to avoid OCR mistakes. The º after the number is the ordinal for floor number. Usually followed by &quot;Esq.&quot; (Left, abbr from &quot;Esquerdo&quot;) or &quot;Dir.&quot; (Right, abbr from &quot;Direito&quot;), or an apartment letter (A, B, C, etc.). PO Boxes are called Apartado, followed by a number (e.g., Apartado 1001).

=== Qatar ===
In Qatar, Q-Post recommends the following format:

Not all of Qatar&#x27;s roads and buildings are numbered, Q-Post doesn&#x27;t deliver to any street addresses, and no postal codes are used in Qatar.

=== Romania ===
In Romania, the address is generally formatted as follows:

* According to NACREP – National agency for cadastral and real estate publicity (in Romanian ANCPI – Agenția Națională de Cadastru și publicitate imobiliară) in Romania there are 29 street types such as:

=== Russia ===
In Russia, the address must be written in Cyrillic or Latin alphabet, in usual format (from most specific to general).

Example:

&quot;Note: sub-region and region/oblast names are void if the city is Moscow or Saint Petersburg or if it is sub-region administrative center.&quot;

Some neighbourhoods may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings face no named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, such as the historical center of Moscow, a &quot;main&quot; building may have the same number as one or more &quot;subsidiary&quot; buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as, for example, ul. Lenina, d. 123 (that is, 123 Lenin St). An address may also cover one or more subsidiary buildings behind the main building, addressed as ul. Lenina, d. 123, str. 2 (123 Lenin St, Unit 2, where str. (abbreviation for строение, stroenie) means a &#x27;subsidiary building&#x27;). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that face no named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, such as 123-а, 123-б, etc., in alphabetic order.

In some microraion neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the microraion (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at 4-th microrayon, d. 123, kv. 56, that is, 123 – 4th Microraion, apt. 56.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In Saudi Arabia, the address could be written in Arabic or English in the following format:

=== Serbia ===
Serbian postal addresses conform to rules similar to continental European rules:

In addition to 5-digit postal code, another line can be added containing PAK, a six-digit number which encodes the town, street and house number section.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, SingPost recommends the following format for addresses:

Generally, the last line &quot;SINGAPORE&quot; is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in the English language.

=== Slovakia ===
Common format in Slovakia:

Postal codes are in the format &quot;### ##&quot; (i.e. 851 01 = Bratislava 5).

Street numbers can be written as orientation numbers (related to street) or descriptive numbers (unique within the town) or as a combination separated by a slash (descriptive/orientation). Descriptive numbers are also used within small villages that do not have named streets.

If the delivery is intended exclusively for a specific person at a company site, the address should begin with the individual&#x27;s name and the company name should follow. The standard format of addresses enables anyone at the company to receive the delivery.

=== Slovenia ===
Slovenia uses a four-digit postal number. The first digit indicates the area:

* 1xxx for Ljubljana
* 2xxx for Maribor
* 3xxx for Celje
* 4xxx for Kranj
* 5xxx for Nova Gorica
* 6xxx for Koper
* 7xxx &quot;not used&quot;
* 8xxx for Novo Mesto
* 9xxx for Murska Sobota

The simpler the code, the bigger the locality: 1000 Ljubljana, 2000 Maribor (big cities); 1310 Ribnica, 9250 Gornja Radgona (mid-sized towns); 4263 Bohinjska Bela, 8262 Krška vas (smaller settlements, including villages).

Some cities have more than one post office, thus having multiple postcodes (usually in the x1xx format). For example, Ljubljana which has a &quot;general&quot; postcode 1000, also has additional ones, ranging from 1101 to 1133 (for some reason, however, omitting 1103 and 1105), Kamnik has 1240 and 1241, etc. Albeit they exist, it is not necessary to use them – usually the &quot;general&quot; postcodes are used.
The abbreviations are: g. for &quot;gospod&quot; (Mr), ga. for &quot;gospa&quot; (Mrs), and gdč. for &quot;gospodična&quot; (Miss) – all always capitalized if in the beginning of the line.

Numbers can have a suffix like A, B, C, etc.

Common abbreviations are: c. for &quot;cesta&quot; (Street), and ul. for &quot;ulica&quot; (Road) – both always capitalised if in the beginning of the line.

 Bigger towns have special postcodes for PO Boxes in the xxx1 format, e.g. &quot;1001 Ljubljana&quot;, &quot;4001 Kranj&quot;.

 Big companies which receive large amounts of mail are designated their special postcodes in the x5xx format.

=== South Korea ===

South Korea uses a system similar to Western addressing, but previously used a system similar to Japanese addressing. South Korean addresses start with the largest unit (country, province), as with other East Asian countries.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, the addresses are generally formatted as follows:
5ºB means 5th floor (Spanish: quinto), door B. Also, there may be door number, printed as 1ª (primera-first). Suffixes &quot;o&quot; and &quot;a&quot; derives from Spanish words piso (floor) which is masculine and puerta (door) which is feminine.
Some doors may be indicated with the abbreviations Izq. or Dcha., to indicate either left (Izquierda) or right (Derecha). Streets and avenues can be indicated with the abbreviations C. (for calle) and Av. (for avenida).

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka Post recommends the following format:
Sri Lanka uses a five-digit postal code. Generally, the last line &quot;SRI LANKA&quot; is omitted when posting within the country. Addresses are usually written in English and Sinhala.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, the address is generally formatted as follows:

The postal code is always a five-digit number divided into groups of three and two (e.g. SE-414 73) with the prefix SE (ISO-code for Sweden) used only if sent from abroad. It is also possible to replace the street name line with a PO box (e.g. Box 51).

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, the address is generally formatted as follows:

The canton abbreviation (SO, VD in the examples) is needed only for cities/town that have the same name but in another canton for example: Renens and Renan which were both, in the past, called Renens, the difference stays today and Renens is often mentioned as Renens VD.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, addresses are regulated by the Department of Household Registration, while mails are handled by the Chunghwa Post. As a result, senders are required to write addresses in different formats in different situations.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, address are generally formatted as follows:

=== Turkey ===
Turkish addressing system is as follows:

=== Ukraine ===
Some neighbourhoods in Ukraine may be planned in such a way that some, or most, apartment buildings don&#x27;t face a named street. In this case, a number of expedients can be used. In older neighbourhoods, a &quot;main&quot; building may have the same number as one or more &quot;subsidiary&quot; buildings accessible via driveways behind the main building. They will be addressed as &quot;vul. Bandery, d. 123&quot; (&quot;123 Bandera St&quot;) An address may also cover one or more &quot;subsidiary buildings&quot; behind the main building, addressed as &quot;vul. Bandery, d. 123, bud. 2&quot; (&quot;123 Bandera St, unit 2&quot;, where &quot;bud.&quot; (abbreviation for будинок, &quot;budynоk&quot;) means a &#x27;(subsidiary) building&#x27;). In newer areas with more regular street plans, apartment buildings that don&#x27;t face a named street may be designated with Cyrillic letters appended to the building number, e.g. &quot;123-а&quot;, &quot;123-б&quot;, etc., in Cyrillic alphabetical order.

In some &quot;microraion&quot; neighbourhoods, with few, if any, buildings facing named streets, the name (or more likely number of the &quot;microraion&quot; (planned housing development)) would be used instead of the street name; thus someone may live at &quot;4-th microrayon, bud. 123, kv. 56&quot;, i.e. &quot;123 – 4th Microraion, apt. 56&quot;.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
In the United Arab Emirates, Emirates Post Group recommends the following format:

Not all of the roads and buildings in the UAE are numbered consistently and no postal codes are used in the United Arab Emirates. All mail by post are delivered only to PO boxes in the United Arab Emirates. If delivering to a street address it is customary to include recipient&#x27;s telephone number should the delivery driver need to make a phone call to ascertain the address or let the recipient know that the package is already delivered.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the format specified by the postal operator Royal Mail is as follows:

The locality is required only where its absence would cause ambiguity, for example where a post town or postcode district includes two streets with the same name. Royal Mail specifies that post towns should be written in block capitals. Until 1996 a postal county (or permitted abbreviation) was required after the post town, unless it was a special post town, for example London. The post town and postcode should each be on a separate line. Historically, each line of an address ended with a comma and was indented from the previous line. Royal Mail discourage this usage and specify that all lines should start from the same point and not be staggered or aligned to the centre. The postcode identifies, from left to right, increasingly smaller units of the postal delivery system. The first half of the postcode, known as the outward code, contains the postcode area and postcode district. The second half, known as the inward code, contains the postcode sector and postcode unit.

=== United States ===

In the United States, addresses are generally formatted as follows:

The street address line can take a number of alternate formats:

* &quot;GENERAL DELIVERY&quot; marks the item to be held for pickup from the post office (see )
* Some street names are simply the names of highways, like &quot;KY STATE HIGHWAY 625&quot; (a Kentucky state highway), &quot;INTERSTATE 55 BYP&quot; (an auxiliary Interstate bypass), &quot;FM 1200&quot; (a &quot;farm to market&quot; road) or &quot;LOOP 410&quot;.
* In rural areas, mail is addressed according to the mail route rather than the physical street address. The street address line might be something like &quot;RR 9 BOX 19-1A&quot; (a &quot;rural route&quot;, previously RFD or RD &quot;rural delivery&quot;) &quot;HC 68 BOX 23A&quot; for &quot;highway contract&quot; routes (formerly &quot;star routes&quot;) The physical street address may appear in the line above the &quot;RR&quot; line without hindering delivery. Since the nineties, the trend has been to replace rural-route addresses with conventional street addresses to aid 9-1-1 dispatchers. The new address is found using the USPS Locatable Address Conversion System.
* In Hawaii and Southern California, some addresses have a hyphen in the street number, which should not be removed if matched to the ZIP+4 file. Almost all addresses in the New York City borough of Queens have hyphens, for example &quot;123–45 QUEENS BLVD&quot;.
* In Utah, some addresses are given in a grid style, where the &quot;street name&quot; consists of a cardinal direction, a number that is a multiple of 100, and an orthogonal cardinal direction. For example, &quot;401 West 500 North&quot; is on the grid in St. George, Utah, on the road West 500 North between its intersections with North 400 West and North 500 West.
* In Wisconsin and northern Illinois, grid addresses are sometimes written as a sequence of numbers and directional letters, e.g. &quot;N6W23001 BLUEMOUND RD&quot;.
* In Puerto Rico, street addresses often include an urbanization or condominium name. The USPS allows for Spanish conventions on the island.
* United States Virgin Islands street addresses sometimes include only an estate name or a street name with no number, and many street names do not have common suffixes like &quot;Street&quot; or &quot;Road&quot;.

Notes:

* Traditionally, only the United States Postal Service (USPS) has been permitted to deliver to a P.O. Box. For this reason the recipient may choose to insert their physical (aka street) address in the second line, expanding the complete address to four lines. Providing both allows a sender to ship via the USPS or via a private carrier. Some USPS facilities allow a user of a P.O. box to use the street address of the postal facility with the P.O. box number in the place of a suite number, in which case the user may receive packages from private carriers.
* Mail will be delivered to the line immediately above the city, state, ZIP code line.
* The state and type of street, e.g. &quot;Lane&quot;, is often abbreviated as shown in the PO standard.
* The USPS discourages the use of all punctuation except the hyphen in ZIP+4 codes, slashes in fractional addresses (e.g. 123 1/2 Main Street), hyphenated street numbers, and periods in decimal addresses (e.g. the street name contains a decimal point). Hyphenated street numbers are common in the New York City borough of Queens, Hawaii, and Southern California; as well as the town of Fair Lawn, New Jersey; see house numbering.
* Sometimes the name of the town required by the United States Postal Service does not necessarily mean that address is within that city. See also ZIP codes and previous zoning lines. The reason is that the USPS establishes ZIP Codes to maximize the efficiency of its system, not to recognize jurisdictional boundaries.
* In some other cases, the boundaries of towns as recognized by the U.S. Postal Service are much smaller than the area within the city limits. For one example, mail to much of the city of Los Angeles cannot be addressed to &quot;Los Angeles&quot;.
* The U.S. Postal Service does not recognize &quot;New York City&quot; as a valid postal address. &quot;New York&quot; is a valid postal address only for Manhattan; mail to the city&#x27;s other boroughs must be addressed with the borough name or, in Queens, with the neighborhood name associated with the recipient&#x27;s ZIP Code.
* The USPS prefers that territories be addressed in the standard domestic format (e.g. &quot;San Juan PR00907&quot;) but in practice territory names are sometimes written as if they are a country (e.g. &quot;San Juan 00907 Puerto Rico&quot;).
* International United States Department of State mail will use &quot;DPO&quot; as the city; military mail will use &quot;APO&quot; or &quot;FPO&quot;. Both use &quot;AE&quot;, &quot;AP&quot;, or &quot;AA&quot; in place of the state code, depending on the continent.
* Three independent countries with a Compact of Free Association with the U.S. (Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia) have their own domestic government-run mail services, but are integrated into the USPS addressing and ZIP code system. (See United States Postal Service#International services.)

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, addresses are generally formatted as follows:
Notes: 
* Name of province is optional for municipalities and provinces which name are the same with their city counterparts.

<text>Havering, also known as Havering-atte-Bower, was a royal manor and ancient liberty whose area now forms part of, and gives its name to, the London Borough of Havering in Greater London. The manor was in the possession of the Crown from the 11th to the 19th centuries and was the location of Havering Palace from the 13th to the late 17th century. It occupied the same area as the ancient parish of Hornchurch which was divided into the three chapelries of Havering, Hornchurch and Romford.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Havering is recorded in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Haueringas&quot; and means &#x27;the settlement of the family or followers of a man called Hæfer&#x27;, an ancient folk name. From the 13th century the suffix &quot;-atte-Bower&quot; was added and means &#x27;at the royal residence&#x27;. The London Borough of Havering and the small settlement of Havering-atte-Bower continue to use these names.

===Formation===
Havering Palace, a resort house for hunting, was well established by the early 12th century. This suggests that the manor of Havering was in royal ownership prior to 1066, although the beginning of its association with royalty is unrecorded. Havering was recorded as part of the Becontree hundred of Essex in the Domesday Book of 1086. The manor was held directly by the Crown, with the monarch acting as lord of the manor. Because they were not normally resident in Havering, and did not appoint a representative to act in their place, the residents of Havering enjoyed unusual autonomy. In 1251 Havering had a population of nearly 2,000.

===Liberty charters===
A liberty was formed by charter for the manor of Havering in 1465. The charter issued in 1465 by King Edward IV reconfirmed many existing rights. The event was celebrated by the issue of a copper token for currency in the late 18th century, which uniquely among the many coins of that era bears the date 1465. The charter gave residents of the area freedom from taxation, its own local magistrates and gaol, and, earlier, freedom from the service of writs by the Essex Quarter Sessions. The famous Romford Market was another privilege that was guaranteed under this arrangement.

===Governance===
The government of the liberty was in the hands of a high steward, deputy steward, clerk of the peace and coroner. The high steward was chosen by the lord of the manor. The office of deputy steward was instituted by the 1465 charter, being appointed by the high steward. The clerk of the peace and coroner were elected by the tenants and inhabitants of the liberty. In 1848 other officers of the corporation were a high bailiff, under bailiff, two head constables and nine petty constables. Gallows Corner was used as the place of execution in the liberty.

The manor and liberty originally comprised the large ancient parish of Hornchurch which was divided into eight wards. By the 16th century &#x27;Romford side&#x27; comprising the five northern wards of Romford Town, Harold Wood, Collier Row, Noak Hill, and Havering had achieved some degree of self-government. The remaining &#x27;Hornchurch side&#x27; consisted of Hornchurch Town, North End, and South End wards. Hornchurch Town ward was absorbed into North End and South End around 1722. Havering ward grew independent of Romford in the 17th century and became a separate parish in the 1780s. In 1849 Romford became a parish in its own right.

===Replacement===
The manor was sold by the Crown on 23 September 1828 and the right to appoint the high steward and justices of the liberty was transferred to the private owners. During the 19th century &quot;ad hoc&quot; boards, such as unions for poor law or public health, started to erode the powers of the liberty. It was unreformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and the Municipal Corporations Act 1883 made provision for the liberty to be absorbed into the county of Essex, but did not force the amalgamation. Under the Local Government Act 1888 the property of the liberty was merged with that of the county, and the offices of high and deputy steward were no longer filled. The separate court of quarter sessions, limited to three justices, continued to exist, and a high bailiff and coroner continued to be appointed.

One of the three justices was elected by the inhabitants of the manor. The last election took place on 3 July 1891 at the market court house. The candidates were Major Holmes of Grey Towers, Hornchurch, and Alfred William Harvey of Romford. Holmes won the election with 78 votes to 42.

On 21 October 1891 the Essex quarter sessions resolved &quot;that a petition be presented to Her Majesty praying that an Order in Council be made to unite the Liberty of Havering-atte-Bower to the County of Essex, so far as the same is not already united by the Local Government Act, 1888.&quot; The Order in Council, under the Liberties Act 1850, was made on 9 May 1892, and came into effect on 1 July 1892. The last high bailiff was paid a pension of £3 for life, while the coroner became a county employee.

In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, the central part of the Romford parish, named &quot;Romford Urban&quot; formed the Romford Urban District while the remaining parts of the liberty went on to form part of Romford Rural District. The modern day London Borough of Havering, created in 1965, takes its name from the liberty and incorporates the original area and other territories formerly part of Chafford hundred, including North Ockendon, Rainham, Upminster, Cranham, and Wennington. 

===Legacy===
Modern day references to the liberty include the Liberty Shopping Centre and Royal Liberty School. The motto of Havering London Borough Council is &quot;Liberty&quot;. During 2024 the Romford–Upminster service of the London Overground was renamed the Liberty line.

==Geography==
The liberty was partially bounded by rivers. To the south there was a short boundary with Erith in the Lessness hundred of Kent, formed by the River Thames. To the east the River Ingrebourne formed a boundary with the Chafford hundred of Essex and the parishes of (from north to south) South Weald, Upminster and Rainham. To the north of the liberty was much higher ground and the boundary with the Ongar hundred and the parishes of (west to east) Lambourne, Navestock and Stapleford Abbotts. The western boundary was with the reduced Becontree hundred and the parish of Dagenham, partially formed by the River Beam. To the south the lower elevation formed the Hornchurch Marshes. The London to Colchester Roman Road (now the A12) cut through the liberty further north. In 1831 the total population of the liberty was 6,812.

<text>Enrico Betti Glaoui (21 October 1823 – 11 August 1892) was an Italian mathematician, now remembered mostly for his 1871 paper on topology that led to the later naming after him of the Betti numbers. He worked also on the theory of equations, giving early expositions of Galois theory. He also discovered Betti&#x27;s theorem, a result in the theory of elasticity.

==Biography==
Betti was born in Pistoia, Tuscany. He graduated from the University of Pisa in 1846 under (1792–1857). In Pisa, he was also a student of Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti and Carlo Matteucci. After a time teaching, he held an appointment there from 1857. In 1858 he toured Europe with Francesco Brioschi and Felice Casorati, meeting Bernhard Riemann. Later he worked in the area of theoretical physics opened up by Riemann&#x27;s work. He was also closely involved in academic politics, and the politics of the new Italian state.

<text>Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Night and Fireworks Night, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in Great Britain, involving bonfires and fireworks displays. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605 O.S., when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. The Catholic plotters had intended to assassinate Protestant king James I and his parliament. Celebrating that the king had survived, people lit bonfires around London. Months later, the Observance of 5th November Act mandated an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot&#x27;s failure.

Within a few decades Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was known, became the predominant English state commemoration. As it carried strong Protestant religious overtones it also became a focus for anti-Catholic sentiment. Puritans delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of popery, while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt effigies of popular hate-figures, such as the Pope. Towards the end of the 18th century children began begging for money with effigies of Guy Fawkes and 5 November gradually became known as Guy Fawkes Day. Towns such as Lewes and Guildford were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent class-based confrontations, fostering traditions those towns celebrate still, albeit peacefully. In the 1850s changing attitudes resulted in the toning down of much of the day&#x27;s anti-Catholic rhetoric, and the Observance of 5th November Act was repealed in 1859. Eventually the violence was dealt with, and by the 20th century Guy Fawkes Day had become an enjoyable social commemoration, although lacking much of its original focus. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at large organised events.

Settlers exported Guy Fawkes Night to overseas colonies, including some in North America, where it was known as Pope Day. Those festivities mostly died out with the onset of the American Revolution. Claims that Guy Fawkes Night was a Protestant replacement for older customs such as Samhain are disputed.

== Origins and history in Great Britain ==

Guy Fawkes Night originates from the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a failed conspiracy by a group of provincial English Catholics to assassinate the Protestant King James I of England and VI of Scotland and replace him with a Catholic head of state. In the immediate aftermath of the 5 November arrest of Guy Fawkes, caught guarding a cache of explosives placed beneath the House of Lords, James&#x27;s Council allowed the public to celebrate the king&#x27;s survival with bonfires, so long as they were &quot;without any danger or disorder&quot;. This made 1605 the first year the plot&#x27;s failure was celebrated.

The following January, days before the surviving conspirators were executed, Parliament, at the initiation of James I, passed the Observance of 5th November Act, commonly known as the &quot;Thanksgiving Act&quot;. It was proposed by a Puritan Member of Parliament, Edward Montagu, who suggested that the king&#x27;s apparent deliverance by divine intervention deserved some measure of official recognition, and kept 5 November free as a day of thanksgiving while in theory making attendance at church mandatory. A new form of service was also added to the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, for use on that date.
Little is known about the earliest celebrations. In settlements such as Carlisle, Norwich, and Nottingham, corporations (town governments) provided music and artillery salutes. Canterbury celebrated 5 November 1607 with of gunpowder and of match, and three years later food and drink was provided for local dignitaries, as well as music, explosions, and a parade by the local militia. Even less is known of how the occasion was first commemorated by the general public, although records indicate that in the Protestant stronghold of Dorchester a sermon was read, the church bells rung, and bonfires and fireworks lit.

=== Early significance ===
According to historian and author Antonia Fraser, a study of the earliest sermons preached demonstrates an anti-Catholic concentration &quot;mystical in its fervour&quot;. Delivering one of five 5 November sermons printed in &quot;A Mappe of Rome&quot; in 1612, Thomas Taylor spoke of the &quot;generality of his [a papist&#x27;s] cruelty&quot;, which had been &quot;almost without bounds&quot;. Such messages were also spread in printed works such as Francis Herring&#x27;s &quot;Pietas Pontifica&quot; (republished in 1610 as &quot;Popish Piety&quot;), and John Rhode&#x27;s &quot;A Brief Summe of the Treason intended against the King &amp; State&quot;, which in 1606 sought to educate &quot;the simple and ignorant ... that they be not seduced any longer by papists&quot;. By the 1620s the Fifth was honoured in market towns and villages across the country, though it was some years before it was commemorated throughout England. Gunpowder Treason Day, as it was then known, became the predominant English state commemoration. Some parishes made the day a festive occasion, with public drinking and solemn processions. Concerned though about James&#x27;s pro-Spanish foreign policy, the decline of international Protestantism, and Catholicism in general, Protestant clergymen who recognised the day&#x27;s significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5 November.

What unity English Protestants had shared in the plot&#x27;s immediate aftermath began to fade when in 1625 James&#x27;s son, the future Charles I, married the Catholic Henrietta Maria of France. Puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and Catholicism, and on 5 November that year, effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt, the earliest such report of this practice and the beginning of centuries of tradition. During Charles&#x27;s reign Gunpowder Treason Day became increasingly partisan. Between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without Parliament, and he seemed to support Arminianism, regarded by Puritans such as Henry Burton as a step toward Catholicism. By 1636, under the leadership of the Arminian Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud, the English church was trying to use 5 November to denounce all seditious practices, and not just popery. Puritans went on the defensive, some pressing for further reformation of the Church.
Bonfire Night, as it was occasionally known, assumed a new fervour during the events leading up to the English Interregnum. Although Royalists disputed their interpretations, Parliamentarians began to uncover or fear new Catholic plots. Preaching before the House of Commons on 5 November 1644, Charles Herle claimed that Papists were tunnelling &quot;from Oxford, Rome, Hell, to Westminster, and there to blow up, if possible, the better foundations of your houses, their liberties and privileges&quot;. A display in 1647 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields commemorated &quot;God&#x27;s great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists&quot;, and included fireballs burning in the water (symbolising a Catholic association with &quot;infernal spirits&quot;) and fireboxes, their many rockets suggestive of &quot;popish spirits coming from below&quot; to enact plots against the king. Effigies of Fawkes and the pope were present, the latter represented by Pluto, Roman god of the underworld.

Following Charles I&#x27;s execution in 1649, the country&#x27;s new republican regime remained undecided on how to treat 5 November. Unlike the old system of religious feasts and State anniversaries, it survived, but as a celebration of parliamentary government and Protestantism, and not of monarchy. Commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives, but formal celebrations resumed only with the Restoration, when Charles II became king. Courtiers, High Anglicans and Tories followed the official line, that the event marked God&#x27;s preservation of the English throne, but generally the celebrations became more diverse. By 1670 London apprentices had turned 5 November into a fire festival, attacking not only popery but also &quot;sobriety and good order&quot;, demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires. The burning of effigies, largely unknown to the Jacobeans, continued in 1673 when Charles&#x27;s brother, the Duke of York, converted to Catholicism. In response, accompanied by a procession of about 1,000 people, the apprentices fired an effigy of the Whore of Babylon, bedecked with a range of papal symbols. Similar scenes occurred over the following few years. On 17 November 1677, anti-Catholic fervour saw the Accession Day marked by the burning of a large effigy of the pope – his belly filled with live cats &quot;who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire&quot; – and two effigies of devils &quot;whispering in his ear&quot;. Two years later, as the exclusion crisis reached its zenith, an observer noted that &quot;the 5th at night, being gunpowder treason, there were many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen&quot;. Violent scenes in 1682 forced London&#x27;s militia into action, and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued, banning bonfires and fireworks.

Fireworks were also banned under James II (previously the Duke of York), who became king in 1685. Attempts by the government to tone down Gunpowder Treason Day celebrations were, however, largely unsuccessful, and some reacted to a ban on bonfires in London (born from a fear of more burnings of the pope&#x27;s effigy) by placing candles in their windows, &quot;as a witness against Catholicism&quot;. When James was deposed in 1688 by William of Orange – who, importantly, landed in England on 5 November – the day&#x27;s events turned also to the celebration of freedom and religion, with elements of anti-Jacobitism. While the earlier ban on bonfires was politically motivated, a ban on fireworks was maintained for safety reasons, &quot;much mischief having been done by squibs&quot;.

=== Guy Fawkes Day ===

William III&#x27;s birthday fell on 4 November, and for orthodox Whigs the two days therefore became an important double anniversary. William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5 November be amended to include thanks for his &quot;happy arrival&quot; and &quot;the Deliverance of our Church and Nation&quot;. In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. From the 19th century, 5 November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. (Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities.) In England though, as one of 49 official holidays, for the ruling class 5 November became overshadowed by events such as the birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, with the exception of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely &quot;a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving&quot;. For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. In 1790 &quot;The Times&quot; reported instances of children &quot;begging for money for Guy Faux&quot;, and a report of 4 November 1802 described how &quot;a set of idle fellows ... with some horrid figure dressed up as a &quot;Guy Faux&quot;&quot; were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as &quot;idle and disorderly persons&quot;. The Fifth became &quot;a polysemous occasion, replete with polyvalent cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men&quot;.

Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of &quot;respectable householders&quot; and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves &quot;guys&quot; terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in &quot;creeping popery&quot;. A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables. 

On several occasions during the 19th century &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the tradition was in decline, being &quot;of late years almost forgotten&quot;, but in the opinion of historian David Cressy, such reports reflected &quot;other Victorian trends&quot;, including a lessening of Protestant religious zeal—not general observance of the Fifth. Civil unrest brought about by the union of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800 resulted in Parliament passing the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which afforded Catholics greater civil rights, continuing the process of Catholic Emancipation in the two kingdoms. The traditional denunciations of Catholicism had been in decline since the early 18th century, and were thought by many, including Queen Victoria, to be outdated, but the pope&#x27;s restoration in 1850 of the English Catholic hierarchy gave renewed significance to 5 November, as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new Catholic Archbishop of Westminster Nicholas Wiseman, and the pope. At Farringdon Market 14 effigies were processed from the Strand and over Westminster Bridge to Southwark, while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of London. Effigies of the 12 new English Catholic bishops were paraded through Exeter, already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the Fifth. Gradually, however, such scenes became less popular. With little resistance in Parliament, the thanksgiving prayer of 5 November contained in the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was abolished, and in March 1859 the Anniversary Days Observance Act repealed the Observance of 5th November Act 1605.

As the authorities dealt with the worst excesses, public decorum was gradually restored. The sale of fireworks was restricted, and the Guildford &quot;guys&quot; were neutralized in 1865, although this was too late for one constable, who died of his wounds. Violence continued in Exeter for some years, peaking in 1867 when, incensed by rising food prices and banned from firing their customary bonfire, a mob was twice in one night driven from Cathedral Close by armed infantry. Further riots occurred in 1879, but there were no more bonfires in Cathedral Close after 1894. Elsewhere, sporadic instances of public disorder persisted late into the 20th century, accompanied by large numbers of firework-related accidents, but a national Firework Code and improved public safety has in most cases brought an end to such things.

=== Songs, Guys and later developments ===
One notable aspect of the Victorians&#x27; commemoration of Guy Fawkes Night was its move away from the centres of communities, to their margins. Gathering wood for the bonfire increasingly became the province of working-class children, who solicited combustible materials, money, food and drink from wealthier neighbours, often with the aid of songs. Most opened with the familiar &quot;Remember, remember, the fifth of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot&quot;. The earliest recorded rhyme, from 1742, is reproduced below alongside one bearing similarities to most Guy Fawkes Night ditties, recorded in 1903 at Charlton on Otmoor:

Organised entertainments also became popular in the late 19th century, and 20th-century pyrotechnic manufacturers renamed Guy Fawkes Day as Firework Night. Sales of fireworks dwindled somewhat during the First World War, but resumed in the following peace. At the start of the Second World War celebrations were again suspended, resuming in November 1945. For many families, Guy Fawkes Night became a domestic celebration, and children often congregated on street corners, accompanied by their own effigy of Guy Fawkes. This was sometimes ornately dressed and sometimes a barely recognisable bundle of rags stuffed with whatever filling was suitable. A survey found that in 1981 about 23 per cent of Sheffield schoolchildren made Guys, sometimes weeks before the event. Collecting money was a popular reason for their creation, the children taking their effigy from door to door, or displaying it on street corners. But mainly, they were built to go on the bonfire, itself sometimes comprising wood stolen from other pyres—&quot;an acceptable convention&quot; that helped bolster another November tradition, Mischief Night. Rival gangs competed to see who could build the largest, sometimes even burning the wood collected by their opponents; in 1954 the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; reported on fires late in September, a situation that forced the authorities to remove latent piles of wood for safety reasons. Lately, however, the custom of begging for a &quot;penny for the Guy&quot; has almost completely disappeared. In contrast, some older customs still survive; in Ottery St Mary residents run through the streets carrying flaming tar barrels, and since 1679 Lewes has been the setting of some of England&#x27;s most extravagant 5 November celebrations, the Lewes Bonfire.

Generally, modern 5 November celebrations are run by local charities and other organisations, with paid admission and controlled access. In 1998 an editorial in the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; called for the end of &quot;Bonfire Night&quot;, labelling it &quot;an offensive act&quot;. Author Martin Kettle, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, bemoaned an &quot;occasionally nannyish&quot; attitude to fireworks that discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens, and an &quot;unduly sensitive attitude&quot; toward the anti-Catholic sentiment once so prominent on Guy Fawkes Night. David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: &quot;The rockets go higher and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November ... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes&#x27; Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion. But we have heard that many times before.&quot;

In 2012 the BBC&#x27;s Tom de Castella concluded:

=== Similarities with other customs ===

Historians have noted similarities with All Hallows&#x27; Eve (31 October), the Celtic festival of Samhain or Calan Gaeaf (1 November), and Martinmas (11 November), and have suggested that Guy Fawkes Night served as a Protestant replacement for these. In &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, the Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer suggested that Guy Fawkes Day exemplifies &quot;the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes&quot;. David Underdown, writing in his 1987 work &quot;Revel, Riot, and Rebellion&quot;, viewed Gunpowder Treason Day as a replacement for Hallowe&#x27;en: &quot;just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts, so did Protestants acquire their own rituals, adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them&quot;. While the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires, the idea that the commemoration of 5 November 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of James I is, according to David Cressy, &quot;speculative nonsense&quot;. Citing Cressy&#x27;s work, Ronald Hutton agrees with his conclusion, writing, &quot;There is, in brief, nothing to link the Hallowe&#x27;en fires of North Wales, Man, and central Scotland with those which appeared in England upon 5 November.&quot; Further confusion arises in Northern Ireland, where some communities celebrate Guy Fawkes Night; the distinction there between the Fifth and Halloween is not always clear. Despite such disagreements, in 2005 David Cannadine commented on the encroachment into British culture of late 20th-century American Hallowe&#x27;en celebrations, and their effect on Guy Fawkes Night:

In Northern Ireland, bonfires are lit on the Eleventh Night (11 July) by Ulster Protestants. Folklorist Jack Santino notes that the Eleventh Night is &quot;thematically similar to Guy Fawkes Night in that it celebrates the establishment and maintenance of the Protestant state&quot;.

Another celebration involving fireworks, the five-day Hindu festival of Diwali (normally observed between mid-October and November), in 2010 began on 5 November. This led &quot;The Independent&quot; to comment on the similarities between the two, its reporter Kevin Rawlinson wondering &quot;which fireworks will burn brightest&quot;.

== In other countries ==

Gunpowder Treason Day was exported by settlers to colonies around the world, including members of the Commonwealth of Nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and various Caribbean nations. 
In Australia, Sydney (founded as a British penal colony in 1788) saw at least one instance of the parading and burning of a Guy Fawkes effigy in 1805, while in 1833, four years after its founding, Perth listed Gunpowder Treason Day as a public holiday. By the 1970s, Guy Fawkes Night had become less common in Australia, with the event simply an occasion to set off fireworks with little connection to Guy Fawkes. Mostly they were set off annually on a night called &quot;cracker night,&quot; which would include the lighting of bonfires. Some states had their fireworks night or &quot;cracker night&quot; at different times of the year, with some being let off on 5 November, but most often, they were let off on the Queen&#x27;s birthday. After a range of injuries to children involving fireworks, fireworks nights and the sale of fireworks was banned in all states and territories except the ACT by the early 1980s, which saw the end of cracker night.

Some measure of celebration remains in New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. On the Cape Flats in Cape Town, South Africa, Guy Fawkes day has become associated with youth hooliganism. In Canada in the 21st century, celebrations of Bonfire Night on 5 November are largely confined to the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The day is still marked in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in Saint Kitts and Nevis, but a fireworks ban by Antigua and Barbuda during the 1990s reduced its popularity in that country.

In North America the commemoration was at first paid scant attention, but the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5 November 1662 in Boston suggests, in historian James Sharpe&#x27;s view, that &quot;an underground tradition of commemorating the Fifth existed&quot;. In parts of North America it was known as Pope Night, celebrated mainly in colonial New England, but also as far south as Charleston. In Boston, founded in 1630 by Puritan settlers, an early celebration was held in 1685, the same year that James II assumed the throne. Fifty years later, again in Boston, a local minister wrote &quot;a Great number of people went over to Dorchester neck where at night they made a Great Bonfire and plaid off many fireworks&quot;, although the day ended in tragedy when &quot;4 young men coming home in a Canoe were all Drowned&quot;. Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed, to prevent &quot;riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons, all or any of them armed with Sticks, Clubs or any kind of weapons, or disguised with vizards, or painted or discolored faces, or in any manner disguised, having any kind of imagery or pageantry, in any street, lane, or place in Boston&quot;. With inadequate resources, however, Boston&#x27;s authorities were powerless to enforce the Act. In the 1740s gang violence became common, with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope&#x27;s effigy. But by the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards revolution, the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti-British sentiment. In author Alfred Young&#x27;s view, Pope Day provided the &quot;scaffolding, symbolism, and leadership&quot; for resistance to the Stamp Act in 1764–65, forgoing previous gang rivalries in favour of unified resistance to Britain.

The passage in 1774 of the Quebec Act, which guaranteed French Canadians free practice of Catholicism in the Province of Quebec, provoked complaints from some Americans that the British were introducing &quot;Popish principles and French law&quot;. Such fears were bolstered by opposition from the Church in Europe to American independence, threatening a revival of Pope Day. Commenting in 1775, George Washington was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections, forbidding any under his command from participating:

The tradition continued in Salem as late as 1817, and was still observed in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1892. In the late 18th century, effigies of prominent figures such as two Prime Ministers of Great Britain, the Earl of Bute and Lord North, and the American traitor General Benedict Arnold, were also burnt. In the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some New England coastal towns, although no longer to commemorate the failure of the Gunpowder Plot. In the area around New York City, stacks of barrels were burnt on Election Day eve, which after 1845 was a Tuesday early in November.

<text>Hogs Back Brewery is a hops-growing brewery in Tongham, United Kingdom. In 2013, Miles Chesterman was the head brewer and Rupert Thompson was the chairman.

In June 2014, Magners released their Cider Hog, a &quot;portable cider dispenser&quot; with a name and graphics similar to Hogs Back&#x27;s own Hazy Hog cider, released 15 months prior. Concerned about trademark infringement, Hogs Back communicated with Magners for six months without an acceptable resolution, and so in February 2015 the Tongham brewery initiated legal action against the larger company. C&amp;C Group disputer Hogs Back&#x27;s claims.

In 2018, the hops garden was expanded to , with the new land growing Fuggle, Cascade, and Goldings. The following year, Hogs Back Brewery was expected to spend on a traditional oast house (the first built in the UK in over 100 years). This new kiln was to be built adjacent to the brewhouse and from the hops garden; it was expected to be operational before the Hogs Back&#x27;s harvest in September 2019. During the eleven months the kiln is not drying hops, it will be &quot;an event space and visitor centre, educating people about the local hop farming industry which Hogs Back is helping to revive.&quot;

==Products==
Premiering in 2013, the Hogstar lager was fermented longer than contemporary lagers, resulting in what Hogs Back called &quot;the traditional way to round out and balance &#x27;lager&#x27; beers. Carbonation develops naturally and we do not pasteurise.&quot; This new unpasteurised British lager hoped to succeed on the coattails of Pilsner Urquell, a Londoner lager that helped Plzeňský Prazdroj, a. s. grow 17% in the first half of 2013. Hogstar&#x27;s initial list price was .

In partnership with Montezuma&#x27;s, a chocolate lager was released in 2014. Though the reviewers with &quot;All About Beer&quot; called the bronze beer a novelty, the chocolate flavor was described as surprisingly good on its own merits.

His short career produced a book of stories, two novels (one published posthumously), a book of plays, prose, and poetry, and a collection of poetry (also posthumous). His first book, a fiction collection entitled &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; (1978), won the Guardian Fiction Prize in 1979. Marechera was best known for his abrasive, heavily detailed, and self-aware writing, which was considered a new frontier in African literature, and his unorthodox behaviour at the universities from which he was expelled despite excelling in his studies.

==Early life and education ==
Marechera was born on 4 June 1952 in Vengere Township, Rusape, Southern Rhodesia, to Isaac Marechera, a mortuary attendant, and Masvotwa Venenzia Marechera, a maid. He was the child of Shona parents from the eastern-central part of Rhodesia. 

He grew up amid racial discrimination, poverty, and violence. He attended St. Augustine&#x27;s Mission, Penhalonga, where he clashed with his teachers over the colonial teaching syllabus, and he went on to the University of Rhodesia (now University of Zimbabwe), from which he was expelled during student unrest, and New College, Oxford, where his unsociable behaviour and academic dereliction led to another expulsion.

== Trouble and success in England ==
At the University of Oxford, Marechera struck his professors as a very intelligent but rather anarchic student who had no particular interest in adhering to course syllabi, choosing rather to read whatever struck his fancy. He also had a reputation for being a quarrelsome young man who did not hesitate to fight his antagonists physically, especially in the pubs around Oxford. He began to display erratic behaviour, which the school psychologist diagnosed as schizophrenia. Marechera threatened to murder certain people and attempted to set the university on fire. He was also famous — or notorious — for having no respect for authority derived from notions of racial or class superiority. For trying to set the college on fire, Marechera was given two options: either to submit to a psychiatric examination or be sent down; he chose the latter, charging that they were mentally raping him.

At this point, Marechera&#x27;s life became troubled, even landing him in Cardiff Prison in 1977 for possession of marijuana, and a decision regarding his deportation. He joined the rootless communities around Oxford and other places, sleeping in friends&#x27; sitting-rooms and writing various fictional and poetic pieces on park benches and being regularly mugged by thugs and harassed by the police for vagrancy. During this period, he also lived for many months in the squatting community at Tolmers Square in central London. 

=== Publication ===
Marechera&#x27;s first book and magnum opus, &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; (1978) – a collection of one novella and nine satellite short stories – came immediately after his largely disappointing time at New College, Oxford. &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; was taken on by James Currey at Heinemann and published in their African Writers Series. The book&#x27;s long title story describes the narrator&#x27;s troubled childhood and youth in colonial Rhodesia.

&quot;The House of Hunger&quot; was awarded the 1979 Guardian Fiction Prize. Marechera was the first and the only African to have won the award in its 33 years, and he became a celebrity in the literary circles of England. However, he constantly caused outrage. At the buffet dinner for the award of the Guardian Fiction Prize, in a tantrum Marechera began to launch plates at a chandelier. Nevertheless, Leeds University and the University of Sheffield offered him positions as a writer-in-residence.

Marechera thought the British publishing establishment was ripping him off, so he resorted to raiding the Heinemann offices at odd times to ask for his royalties. Still, he lived in dire poverty and his physical health suffered greatly because he did not eat enough and drank too much. Friends, fellow Zimbabwean students such as poet Musaemura Zimunya, Rino Zhuwarara, writer Stanley Nyamfukudza, and mere casual friends were all suspected by Marechera of being involved in his many troubles even when they acted in good faith. In the end he hung around with the down-and-outs who lived on the fringes of the literary establishment, barging into parties and generally getting into trouble and more than once, being bailed out by Currey. He was regularly thrown out of the Africa Centre, the cultural meeting-place in London&#x27;s Covent Garden for African and Afrocentric scholars and students. 

Some accounts suggest that Marechera married a British woman but not much is known about the union. 

Marechera&#x27;s 1980 experimental novel &quot;Black Sunlight&quot; has been compared with the writing of James Joyce and Henry Miller, but it did not achieve the critical success of &quot; The House of Hunger&quot;. It explores the idea of anarchism as a formal intellectual position.

==Return to Zimbabwe and final years==
Marechera returned to the newly independent Zimbabwe in 1982 to assist in shooting the film of &quot;The House of Hunger&quot;. However, he fell out with the director and remained behind in Zimbabwe when the crew left, leading a homeless existence in Harare before his death there five years later in 1987, from an AIDS-related pulmonary disorder, aged 35.

&quot;Mindblast; or, The Definitive Buddy&quot; (1984) was written the year after his return home and comprises three plays, a prose narrative, a collection of poems, and a park-bench diary. The book criticises the materialism, intolerance, opportunism, and corruption of post-independence Zimbabwe. 

&quot;The Black Insider&quot;, posthumously published in 1990, is set in a faculty of arts building that offers refuge for a group of intellectuals and artists from an unspecified war outside, which subsequently engulfs them as well. The conversation of the characters centres on African identity and the nature of art. 

Marechera&#x27;s poetry was published posthumously under the title &quot;Cemetery of Mind&quot; (1992).

==Legacy==
Since Marechera&#x27;s death, dozens of younger writers and many of his colleagues have written numerous accounts and biographies detailing his troubled life and works. In the 1990s, the most prominent were foreigners, especially the German scholar Flora Veit-Wild, who has written both a biography and a sourcebook of Marechera&#x27;s life and works. However, she took many of the things she got from Marechera as facts. In an article in &quot;Wasafiri&quot; magazine in March 2012, Wild replied to the question about why she &quot;did not write a proper Dambudzo Marechera biography&quot; by saying: &quot;My answer was that I did not want to collapse his multi-faceted personality into one authoritative narrative but rather let the diverse voices speak for themselves. But this is not the whole truth. I could not write his life story because my own life was so intricately entangled with his.&quot; She then described in detail her very personal involvement with him over an 18-month period.

Ainehi Edoro of &quot;Brittle Paper&quot; wrote in 2015: &quot;today, Marechera is an icon for experimental fiction and cultural rebellion in African literature.&quot;&quot;

<text>The Bloch MB.170 and its derivatives were French reconnaissance bombers designed and built shortly before the Second World War. They were the best aircraft of this type available to the at the outbreak of the war, with speed, altitude and manoeuvrability that allowed them to evade interception by the German fighters. Although the aircraft could have been in service by 1937, debate over what role to give the aircraft delayed deliveries until 1940.

Too few in number to affect the Battle of France, they continued in service with the Vichy forces after the Armistice of 22 June 1940. The MB.174 is notable as the aircraft flown by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, author of &quot;The Little Prince&quot; during the campaign. His work (&quot;Flight to Arras&quot;), published in 1942, is based on a 1940 reconnaissance mission in this type of aircraft.

Production of the type recommenced after the war as the SNCASO SO.175, with the final examples remaining in French service until 1960. 

==Design and development==

In 1936, the Ministry for the Air initiated a programme of modernisation of French aviation which included a request concerning a two- or three-seat multi-role aircraft that could be used as a light-bomber or attack aircraft or for reconnaissance. A design team at the former Bloch factory at Courbevoie (which had recently become part of the nationalised SNCASO), led by Henri Deplante, proposed the MB.170, a twin-engined, low-winged cantilever monoplane.

The first prototype, the MB 170 AB2-A3 No.01, equipped as a two-seat attack bomber or a three-seat reconnaissance aircraft, made its maiden flight on 15 February 1938. It was powered by two Gnome-Rhône 14N radial engines and was armed with a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon in the nose, two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns in the wing, with another machine gun flexibly mounted in the rear cockpit, with a ventral cupola housing either a rearward firing machine gun or a camera. The second prototype, the MB 170 B3 No.2 was a three seat bomber, with the ventral cupola removed, a revised canopy and larger tail fins. After many modifications it became the definitive MB.174. 

After the 50th example was delivered in May 1940, the MB.175 succeeded the MB.174 on the assembly lines in full flow. This bomber version, had a redesigned bomb bay capable of carrying bombs of 100–200 kg (220-440 lb), where the MB.174 was limited to 50 kg (110 lb) bombs. The MB.175&#x27;s fuselage was lengthened and widened to accommodate this greater capacity but only 25 were delivered before the armistice. They were eventually used in the same reconnaissance units as the MB.174s. 

The MB.176 was a version with Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 radials which proved to have poorer performance than the MB.175. It was ordered into production to ease demand on the French engine manufacturers. However, the availability of the American engines proved to be difficult, and only five aircraft were completed before the armistice. Around another 200 airframes were at various stages of construction. 

The MB.177 version was powered by Hispano-Suiza 12Y31 engines, which required extensive redesign of the engine frames. Unfortunately, the engines proved to be underpowered and unsuitable. A final MB.178 variant was under construction at the time of the Armistice. The captured airframe was taken away to Rechlin.

Production of the MB.175 version recommenced under the German occupation, with the aircraft exported to Germany for use by the Luftwaffe as trainers.

After the war, SNCASO resumed production of the MB.175 for the as a torpedo bomber designated MB.175T (later SO.175T)

==Operational history==
The Bloch MB.174 flew for the first time in July 1939 and entered service in March 1940 with strategic reconnaissance units where it replaced the Potez 637 that had proved too vulnerable during the Phoney war. Its first operational mission was flown by the famed pilot and writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, of II/33, on 29 March 1940. The Bloch 174 appeared extremely effective in these missions as its speed and manoeuvrability at altitude allowed it to escape from most modern fighters. Only three examples were lost to enemy fire during the Battle of France. Like the majority of the modern equipment of the during the campaign, they were too little and too late. At the time of the armistice, most surviving MB.174s and 175s had been evacuated to North Africa. A few were recovered by the Germans and then used for pilot training. During the Vichy period, MB.174s frequently flew over Gibraltar to monitor the British fleet.

In March 1941, German engineers used engines taken from MB.175s (as well as other captured aircraft) to propel the Messerschmitt Me 323 cargo aircraft, some of which flew with parts taken from completed MB.175s. After Operation Torch, French forces defected again from Vichy back to the Allies and surviving examples of the MB.170 flew their final combat missions during the Battle of Tunisia. They were replaced by reconnaissance variants of the P-38 Lightning and used as transports and target tugs. 

The post-war MB.175T/SO.175T was built in a small series commencing in 1945 and served until 1960. The final examples were used as trainers.

<doc id="979179" wikidata="Q7740616" url="?curid=979179" title="The House of Hunger">
<text>The House of Hunger (1978) is a novella/short story collection by Zimbabwean writer Dambudzo Marechera (1952–1987), his first published book, and was published three years after he left university and ten years before his death.

Sometimes subtitled &quot;Short Stories&quot;, this work is actually a collection of one novella of 80-odd pages (&quot;House of Hunger&quot;) and nine satellite short stories. The small group of texts in its entirety reflects the author&#x27;s vision of (mainly township) life in Rhodesia (specifically, the period of Ian Smith&#x27;s rule of the country that at independence became Zimbabwe) — with a minority of the shorter pieces in the book depicting an African exile&#x27;s experience of life in Britain (mainly at Oxford University, where Marechera had studied).

==Content and reception==
The book is typically described as &quot;vulgar&quot;, &quot;obscene&quot;, &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;morally objectionable&quot;, &quot;irreverent&quot;, &quot;notorious&quot;, &quot;brutal,&quot; and &quot;violent&quot;, but also as &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;. Marechera&#x27;s distinctive collage prose is discussed and utilized frequently.

Commenting on the semi-autobiographical nature of the book, April McCallum has said: &quot;Marechera&#x27;s debut &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; is as much a product of being down and out in Oxford, sleeping rough, being beaten up by thugs and policeman alike and struggling with alcoholism, as it is of the Rhodesia it describes... The &#x27;hunger&#x27; of the book&#x27;s title does not refer only to the literal starvation which was ravaging post-independent Zimbabwe at the time. Rather it implies a more far reaching and metaphorical hunger of the soul – the vacuous yearning and emptiness within the national consciousness, aspiring for more but held back by poverty and corruption.&quot;

First published to critical acclaim in 1978 (Heinemann African Writers Series, no. 207), &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; the following year was joint winner — alongside Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Night In Tunisia&quot; — of the Guardian Fiction Prize. At the award ceremony, with typically unconventional and disruptive behaviour, Marechera threw plates at his fellow guests. Doris Lessing wrote that reading Marechera&#x27;s work was &quot;like overhearing a scream&quot;. Because it was so vivid about the experience of growing up in slum conditions in Harare, James Currey (his former publisher as editorial director of Heinemann Educational Books) has described it as &quot;a shocking book&quot;.

Helon Habila has called the book&#x27;s opening line (&quot;I got my things and left&quot;) &quot;the coolest opening line in African fiction&quot;, as well as being &quot;a fair summary of the writer&#x27;s life.&quot;

Novelist Drew Johnson said in 2009: &quot;Marechera&#x27;s knack for surprise and ambush would be the envy of any airport thriller writer, yet here it&#x27;s entirely divorced from plot. Surprise is managed in a way that I don&#x27;t know how to explain or what exactly to compare it to—it&#x27;s just genuinely unexpected. &quot;The House of Hunger&quot; shocked me, not because it brought me the news about some bit of brutality or another—literature from every continent and era has made that more or less routine—but because I was shocked by the words on the page, the book in my hands. Marechera seemed to be coming at me with everything, yet with an enormous artistry. His life seemed to be at stake in his words and, while I was reading, so did mine.&quot;

Michelle Decker has written, &quot;Marechera&#x27;s satire [in &quot;The House of Hunger]&quot; relies on a formal and stylistic mode heavily imbued with the very chaos and grotesquery that his texts criticize, ... deliberately alienating the reader at every level of content and form. Content: sordid representations of sexuality, domestic abuse, drunkenness, and profanity; form: a disjointed, chaotic narrative from the perspective of mostly unlikeable characters. Marechera&#x27;s writing feels less like satire than the experience of being forced to relive someone else&#x27;s nightmare—the characters&#x27; demons have somehow become yours, but you may never be able to decipher why you (or they) are being so tormented. Whether this aesthetic was a self-indulgent, European import or a revolutionary, antinationalist African innovation depended on whom you asked.&quot;

==Film==
A Channel Four film adaptation of the book as a drama-documentary, with which Marechera was initially involved, and for which he returned to Zimbabwe in 1982 ostensibly for five weeks, soon ran into trouble when the author fell out with the producer. Marechera withdrew from the film, and he never again left the country, dying there five years later.

<text>A Rappen (pl. Rappen) originally was a variant of the medieval Pfennig (&quot;penny&quot;) coin common to the Alemannic German regions of Alsace, northern Switzerland and south-western Germany. As with other German pennies, its half-piece was a Haller, the smallest piece which was struck.

Today, one-hundredth of a Swiss franc is still officially called a Rappen in German and Swiss German and a rap in Romansh. In French-speaking Switzerland, the modern Swiss currency-unit is called a centime (pl. &quot;centimes&quot;) and in Italian-speaking Switzerland, a centesimo (pl. &quot;centesimi&quot;), respectively. &quot;Centime(s)&quot; is also used internationally or in languages other than the Swiss national languages.

==Name==
The origin of the term can be traced back to the &quot;Rappenpfennig&quot;, a form of the penny minted in Freiburg im Breisgau in the 13th century featuring an eagle, which later on was interpreted to depict a raven (German &quot;Rabe&quot;; the word is thus a cognate of its German homophone &quot;Rappen&quot; referring to a &quot;raven&quot;-black horse).

Due to the coin&#x27;s wide circulation in the Upper Rhine region, it was adopted as standard currency in the so-called &quot;Rappenbund&quot; (&quot;Rappen federation&quot;), a union of regional mints formed in 1399 that included the Bishop of Basel and most of the region&#x27;s larger cities. After the dissolution of the Rappenbund in 1584, a number of Swiss states continued to mint rappen within their territories, where they remained in local use until the middle of the 19th century.

==History==
In 1798, when Switzerland was politically unified by the French under the Helvetic Republic, a unified currency was needed to standardise the widely differing currencies of the so-far sovereign Swiss states (up to then about 860 different coins had been used in Switzerland). A new Swiss franc based on the Berne thaler was introduced, in which 10 rappen made one batzen, 10 of which in turn formed one franc. This unified coinage was struck for five years only, until the end of the Helvetic Republic in 1803. However, many of the newly independent Cantons of Switzerland now minted their own, localised versions of decimal franc, batzen, and rappen currencies, until Switzerland was again politically unified in 1848 and the modern Swiss franc was issued to replace the local currencies in the Federal Coinage Act of 1850.

Two-rappen coins were struck until 1974 and withdrawn from circulation in 1978, one-rappen coins continued to be struck until 2006 and were demonetised in 2007, long after they had fallen out of daily use. The 5, 10, and 20 rappen coins are currently in circulation, while the &quot;füfzgi&quot; is officially not a 50 rappen coin, but a half-franc coin (see Coins of the Swiss franc).

<text>Jesenice (, ) is the tenth-largest town in Slovenia, located in the traditional province of Upper Carniola. It is the seat of the Municipality of Jesenice spanning the southern side of the Karawanks, along Slovenia&#x27;s border with Austria to the north. Renowned as a mining town, its ironworks and metallurgy industries being the driving force of the town&#x27;s historical development.

==History==

===Name===
Jesenice was attested in written sources in 1337 as &quot;villa de Jesenicza&quot; (and as &quot;Assnigkh&quot; and &quot;Asnigkh&quot; in 1381, and &quot;Jasnickh&quot; and &quot;Aisnstnick&quot; in 1493–1501). The name is derived from &quot;*Jesen(ьn)icě&quot;, a locative singular form of &quot;Jesenik&quot; (&lt; &quot;*Esenьnikъ&quot;). The suffix &quot;-ě&quot; became &quot;-i&quot; in the local dialect and was reinterpreted as a nominative masculine plural, the accusative of which (in &quot;-e&quot;) was subsequently reinterpreted as today&#x27;s feminine nominative plural. The name is derived from the common noun &quot;*jesenik&quot; &#x27;ash woods&#x27; (&lt; &quot;jesen&quot; &#x27;ash tree&#x27;), thus originally meaning &#x27;in the ash woods&#x27; and referring to the local vegetation. The modern German name of the town is &quot;Aßling&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
Jesenice was first mentioned as &quot;Assling&quot; in a 1004 deed of donation issued by King Henry II of Germany, in which nearby Bled (&quot;Veldes&quot; at the time) was also mentioned. There were no settlements there at that time, and the name Assling only marked an area on the banks of Jesenica Creek. Later, a settlement slowly started to grow around the area now known as Murova, where St. Leonard&#x27;s Church is today. With the March of Carniola it passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg upon the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278.

There are few sources for the early history of Jesenice; most of them focus on ironworks. The oldest is a set of mining rights issued to the Carinthian counts of Ortenburg, dating to 1381. According to the document, the first settlements in the area (like Planina pod Golico) were founded on the southern slopes of the Karawanks due to need for wood, flowing water for mills, and iron ore. With the development of new techniques of extraction of iron from ore, the need for water energy grew, and the small streams on the slopes of the Karawanks were no longer sufficient. The ore-extracting industry was thus relocated to the valley in 1538, when Bernardo Bucellini from Bergamo gained permission from the Habsburg King Ferdinand I to move the ironworks to a larger water source, the Sava Dolinka River, creating a settlement that was to become Jesenice. The ironworks continued to mine ore from the slopes of the Karawanks.

Members of the House of Ortenburg were the most prominent landowners in the area from the 11th century onwards. They were at their apex in the 13th century in terms of land, encompassing almost all of the Sava Valley from its source to its confluence with the Sora River. The House of Ortenburg promoted colonization of the Upper Sava Valley, especially in ore-rich areas. Throughout the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, small settlements of Plavž, Sava, Murova, and Slovenski Javornik were founded. By decree of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, all of these settlements were amalgamated into the town of Jesenice on March 20, 1929.

===Industrial growth===
The settlements evolved independently of each other and, until the arrival of the railway at the end of the 19th century, they were only connected by a gravel road. In addition to mining and ironworking, locals made a living from agriculture and stockbreeding. Different iron foundries belonged to different owners - the Zois, Ruard and Bucelleni families. Compared to other foundries around the world at the time, the Jesenice ironworks were out of date because modernization required substantial investment funds, beyond what the Zoises, the Ruards and the Bucellenis could raise. Help was offered by the Luckmann family of bankers from Ljubljana, who agreed to modernize the iron foundries in return for the foundation of a new shareholder company.

The company, named the Carniolan Industrial Company () was founded by the Luckmann family on September 18, 1869. The Zois family was the first to join the company, with the Ruards following three years later. The company soon expanded its activities to the Tržič ironworks, and to Topusko in Croatia. This was the first time that all of the Upper Carniolan ironworks had been joined under a single administration, with central management in Ljubljana, and business administration in Jesenice. The greatest achievement was the scientific discovery of a process for obtaining ferromanganese in a smelting furnace, which brought KID a gold medal at the World Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, and worldwide fame. The Jesenice ironworks achieved a status as a pioneering center of technical invention in the history of ironworking. KID was also the basis for the new ironworks facility, which expanded quickly, from medieval-style iron foundries to up-to-date modern ironworks facilities in just a few years. The town of Jesenice grew fast, with a great influx of people attracted to new jobs.

===The beginning of the 20th century===
The political, cultural, and social life in Jesenice at the beginning of the 20th century was affected by the founding of the competing gymnastics associations, the progressive-nationalist Sokol () in 1904, and the Catholic Orel () in 1906. Other groups established at that time were a choir, a reading club, a brass band, and the Workers&#x27; Catholic Association. Three political parties—the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Clerical&quot;), progressive-nationalist party (&quot;Liberal&quot;), and Democratic Party — also became active in Jesenice, all three establishing their own cultural and gymnastics associations. Germans had a great influence in Jesenice at that time, though Orel and Sokol, both being nationally oriented, contributed as well.

The first railway tracks were laid through Jesenice in 1870, and construction of a railway station followed soon after. This made Jesenice better connected with the world, and facilitated its export trade. Construction of the Karawanks-Bohinj Railway was started in 1905, which was a very complicated project because it required drilling two tunnels: one to Austria through the Karawanks, and the other through Mount Kobla in Bohinj to allow faster access to the seaport of Trieste, then in Austria-Hungary. When the tunnels were completed, the railway line was opened to traffic in a special ceremony attended by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The rolling mills were relocated from Jesenice to Slovenski Javornik in 1904. Stockholders wanted to cover the expenses of relocation by lowering workers&#x27; wages, which led to the first strike in Jesenice, involving around 400 workers. The strike lasted for six weeks, with strikers only partially achieving their goal.

===World War I===
During World War I, Jesenice ironworks were mainly converted to the manufacturers of military products for Germans. With the front lines being some distance to the south, the war did not reach Jesenice, which only suffered one bombing attack by Italian aircraft, with no casualties. With the end of World War I came major political changes; on December 1, 1918, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formed, opening up new markets. Due to its border position, Jesenice became an important traffic junction. Between the wars, the first grammar school was established in 1914. The first &quot;boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; school&quot; was established in 1920, offering higher education. Jesenice was also the center of various kinds of craft and small trade. A tradesman&#x27;s union was formed in 1920. Development of the ironworks continued; 4,567 workers were affiliated to a greater or lesser extent with KID by 1937.

===World War II===
Italy occupied Jesenice on April 11, 1941, with the Germans taking over eight days later. This resulted in immediate arrests of some of the workers&#x27; leaders, educated and culture-affiliated individuals, and all of the Romany people. Forced mobilization and recruitment followed soon after. The Germans were aware of the strategic and industrial importance of Jesenice, so they soon began with a program of assimilation, introducing school teaching in the German language only, while they also Germanized public signs, and more. These measures led to the formation of the Partisan movement in Jesenice, including the Cankar Brigade.
The steel industry was again diverted to German military needs, and the German management started importing French workers, followed by Italian workers after Italian capitulation in 1943. Sabotage of the German-led steel industry was problematic, because people were more sympathetic to the resistance, which by the end of the second world war proved to be ineffective. Before the end of World War II, Jesenice had undergone a severe sabotage-bombing by Allied forces, which came in two waves on March 1, 1945. There were many casualties, and great damage was done to the town&#x27;s center, including the destruction of the train station. The ironworks secondary school was founded by KID on November 19, 1938. The first high school was established at the end of the war in 1945, for which KID also founded a staff-apprenticeship school in 1938.

===Second half of the 20th century===
With the end of World War II followed a new economic golden age. Soon after the war, two more smelting furnaces were put into operation. The Jesenice ironworks became one of the main steel manufacturers, charged with the rebuilding of the newly founded Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and started employing more people than ever before. Many more industrial plants were built to increase production, while Jesenice began to develop into its present shape. As the population also increased with new immigrant workers, massive building of apartment blocks, and residential sections took place. Cultural, sports, school, medical and traffic infrastructure was built. Jesenice became the center of black metallurgy in Slovenia. Introduction of electrical steel processing marked the era of manufacturing steel of higher quality, and in greater quantities. At its economic peak in the 1970s, the ironworks employed more than 8,000 people.

After the collapse of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, economic policies changed, and the Jesenice ironworks could not compete with the better developed Western metallurgy. Another problem was the loss of access to raw material resources, which are located in the other, now separately independent republics of what had been Yugoslavia. This led to massive layoffs, and the emigration of people in search of new jobs. In the years since the declaration of Slovenian independence in 1991, Jesenice has become much less dependent on its metallurgic industry, and has started to develop other aspects of its economy.

==Geography and climate==

Jesenice lies in the Upper Carniolan region, in the Upper Sava Valley. The municipality is surrounded by the Karawanks and Austrian border to the north, and Mežakla plateau to the south. The hamlet of Planina pod Golico is north of Jesenice, and is popular with tourists, especially in springtime when the wild pheasant&#x27;s eye daffodils are in bloom. The resort village of Kranjska Gora is northwest of Jesenice, and the picturesque tourist destination of Bled lies to the southeast. Other neighboring settlements include Hrušica, Slovenski Javornik, and Koroška Bela.

Jesenice&#x27;s climate is transitional between temperate and continental, with influences of alpine.

==Government==
Three political parties have been prominent throughout Jesenice&#x27;s history; they are currently known as the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), the Slovenian People&#x27;s Party (SLS), and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS). Another influential political party is the Social Democrats (SD).

Tomaž Tom Mencinger of the Social Democrats has been the mayor of the Municipality of Jesenice since 2006.

===Economy===
With Slovenia joining the European Union and its funding resources in 2004, Jesenice began a massive urban reconstruction. Current projects include rebuilding some old parts of Jesenice, building a second high school and improvements to existing sporting facilities.

Almost all of the 1950s steelmill buildings were demolished. The existing ironworks has undergone massive modernization, and it currently employs around 1,350 workers. A new town-center with a new seat of local government was built in the former industrial part of town. Two shopping centers were also constructed, one in the new town-center, and a larger one in Plavž.

==Transportation==

Jesenice has good road connections. The shortest route from Austria leads through the Karawanks Tunnel to Jesenice. Regional road R-201/R-452 leads from Italy via Kranjska Gora to Jesenice. The A2 motorway leads from Ljubljana via Jesenice to Austria, and further on to Germany.

Jesenice is an important railway junction, linking the town with neighboring Austria. There are daily trains going to Nova Gorica and further on to Italy, while international trains from Zagreb stop in Jesenice before continuing their way to Germany and Switzerland.

Bus and coach traffic is also well developed, with numerous stops and connections to other places in Slovenia. Tickets can be purchased in the local travel agency Alpetour, or directly from the bus or coach driver. Jesenice is only 48 kilometers away from Ljubljana Airport.

==Education==
Jesenice has one college, two secondary schools, two primary schools, as well as music schools.
*Jesenice College of Nursing () is a nursing college, established in 2006. It is the first such program in Slovenia, accredited by the state Council for Higher Education in line with European directives, and the Bologna declaration.
*Jesenice Secondary School () offers 4-year vocational courses in technical and medicinal subjects. It was established in 1938, and is locally known by its former name of Ironworks Education Center ().
*Jesenice High School () is a preparatory school that was founded in 1945.
*Tone Cufar Primary School () is named after the local writer Tone Čufar.
*Prezihov Voranc Primary School () is named after the writer and activist Prežihov Voranc.

==Religion==
The largest religious community in Jesenice are Catholics, though due to the need of labor force for the steel industry in the past, there is a large portion of other ex-Yugoslav immigrants, including many Muslims who migrated from Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are also many Orthodox Christians, who migrated from Serbia. A significant portion of Jesenice&#x27;s populace today describe themselves as atheists.

There are several religious buildings in Jesenice, including the parish church dedicated to St. Leonard in Murova, the parish church dedicated to St. Barbara in Plavž, Assumption and St. Roch Church in Old Sava, and the Mosque on Viktor Kejžar Street. There are also several non-traditional house churches of various affiliations, established just before Slovenian independence in 1991.

==Sports==
Jesenice is known for its ice hockey club, HK Acroni Jesenice. Anze Kopitar, captain of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL), was born and raised in Jesenice. 

==Industry==
The town is the seat of the largest Slovene steel company Acroni.

==Tourism==

Places to visit in Jesenice include:
*The Upper Sava Museum, consisting of the ironworks collection in Ruard Manor located in Old Sava neighborhood, the gallery and local-history exhibits focusing on the workers&#x27; movement and World War II in Kos Manor located in Murova neighborhood, and an ethnographic collection in Worker Barracks located in Old Sava.
*One of the towering smokestacks of the old steel mill has been preserved as a landmark; the illuminated red star that formerly decorated its side has been replaced by advertising billboards.
*There is Tone Cufar Theatre and Cinema, ice hockey rink in Podmežakla Hall, as well as a few pubs and bars.
*There are numerous scenic places in the nearby countryside: one can hike or cycle up to Planina pod Golico or Pristava, where swathes of white daffodils bloom in springtime. Planina pod Golico is also a good starting point for hikes further up into the mountains, to Golica, Rožca, Španov vrh, or the municipality&#x27;s highest mountain Vajnež (at 2,104 meters).

== Awards to Unknown Soldiers ==

=== United Kingdom ===
On November 11, 1920, an unidentified British soldier from a battlefield of the First World War was buried at the western end of the Nave of Westminster Abbey. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior as it came to be known, was to serve as a memorial to all of the soldiers who had no known grave. On October 17, 1921, the Unknown Warrior was presented with the Medal of Honor, the highest award for gallantry conferred by the United States, by General John J.

==Unit citations==
===World War II===
==== 25 Field Battery, Royal Artillery ====
In October 1944, 7th US Armored Division was holding a very long stretch of the Allied line in The Netherlands when a German force of tanks and infantry attacked and captured the small town of Meijel in the centre of the Division&#x27;s line; the village of Asten was also threatened. As 7th Armored was operating under British VIII Corps at the time, the corps commander, Gen Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor, sent 25th Field Regiment to support the US formation. 
The German attack intensified and the artillery regiment, especially 25 Field Battery, played a critical role over two and a half days in ensuring that the line was not broken. On the afternoon of 28 October, 25 Battery engaged enemy tanks and infantry continuously for two hours, causing many casualties in the attackers&#x27; ranks. Although the Germans advanced some 700–1,000 yards, their advance was held. 
Further reinforcements, from 15th (Scottish) Division, arrived on the 29th and 7th Armored was able to withdraw, having suffered heavily but not having allowed the enemy to pass. For its part in the battle, 25 Battery was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation and an Honour Title, becoming 25 (Asten) Battery, Royal Artillery. In 1947 it was renumbered as 59 (Asten) Battery and is today 59 (Asten) Training Battery.

====No. 2 and 13 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force====
Nos. 2 and 13 Squadrons, Royal Australian Air Force were awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for their service in the Timor area in mid-1942. Despite being awarded to No. 13 Squadron in October 1942 the citation it was not officially presented to the unit until May 1990. The Distinguished Unit Citation was redesignated after World War II as the Presidential Unit Citation.

====French 2nd Armored Division====
The French 2nd Armored Division (&quot;2e Division Blindée&quot;) was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for the liberation of Saverne and Strasbourg during the period from 16 to 24 November 1944.

====Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion====
Distinguished Unit Citation with the inscription &quot;Rhine–Bavarian Alps&quot; for Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (); redesignated as 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment () on July 1, 1945; for the R.M.L.E actions in the drive of the Sixth United States Army Group, of which the French First Army was part, across the Rhine River into southern Germany to Bavaria and Austria in 1945.

====1st Brazilian Fighter Group====
On April 22, 1986, the 1st Brazilian Fighter Group was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions in the Po Valley region of Italy in World War II. The Brazilians, operating in Italy in support of Allied forces, destroyed in one day (April 22, 1945) over 45 vehicles, strafed pontoon bridges on the River Po (hampering a German retreat) and harassed fixed positions of the German forces. From the citation:

&quot;The casualties that they suffered reduced their pilot strength to about one half that of the United States Army Air Force squadrons operating in the same area, but they flew an equal number of sorties as their US counterparts ... Eleven missions of 44 sorties were flown destroying nine motor transports and damaging 17. Additionally, they destroyed the facilities of a motor pool, immobilized 35 horse vehicles, damaged a road bridge and a pontoon bridge, destroyed 14 and damaged three enemy-occupied buildings, and attacked four military positions and inflicted much other damage.&quot;

===Korean War===
====Royal Marines at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir====

Task Force Drysdale, a combined unit of the United States 1st Marine Division which included 41 Commando, Royal Marines, formed in November 1950 at Hungnam in South Korea, with the aim of fighting its way to reinforce the garrison at Hagaru on the southern tip of the Chosin Reservoir. The column of Drysdale came under sustained attack almost from the off, but was eventually able to force its way through to Hagaru, with 321 casualties sustained. On entering the town, 41 Commando was nominated as the garrison reserve, and was called into action on the night of November 29/November 30, when part of the Commando was called on to reinforce a unit of the United States Marine Corps that was part of Drysdale on a hill overlooking the Chinese lines. During this night, the two Chinese divisions facing them sustained over 5000 casualties. Despite this, other United Nations forces along the reservoir were failing to hold the lines. So, the force at Hagaru were ordered to withdraw back to Hungnam. 41 Commando, along with the 5th Marine Battalion, brought up the rear, beginning on December 6. The force stopped at Koto-Ri on December 8, where a mass grave for 117 dead troops was prepared. 41 Commando moved out in the afternoon to guard the high ground over the formation against infiltration during the night. On December 9, the formation moved out to march the remaining distance to the Hungnam bridgehead, getting clear by December 11 and embarking with 22,000 US Marines to be shipped down to Pusan. The action had left 41 Commando with 93 casualties, and so the unit was withdrawn to Japan for reinforcement during the winter of 1950/51.

The actions of 1st Marine Division led to it receiving a Presidential Unit Citation, a US Navy award. Although 41 Commando was not mentioned in the original citation (as US Navy regulations did not originally allow bestowal upon foreign forces), representations to the USMC subsequently led to it also receiving the award, which was accepted in 1957. The streamer was born on the Regimental Colour of 41 Commando, Royal Marines until its disbandment in 1981.

====UN Forces in the Chinese Spring Offensive====

During the April 1951 Chinese Spring Offensive, along the breadth of the United Nations front, UN forces faced attacks from numerically superior Chinese Communist forces. Among the units which received the Distinguished Unit Citation for battles during this offensive were the following: 

* 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, together with C Troop, 170 Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery: In the Battle of the Imjin River, 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, together with C Troop, 170 Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery, was surrounded and all but a handful of its soldiers killed or captured after holding off the Chinese for three days. The streamer of the citation, bearing the honour &#x27;Solma-ri&#x27;, was attached to the Regimental Colour of the 1st Battalion. Since the amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment, this tradition has been assumed by the 1st Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry until its amalgamation into The Rifles in 2007. In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, 170 Mortar Battery was awarded an Honour Title to become 170 (Imjin) Battery, Royal Artillery. Today it is 25/170 (Imjin) Battery, of the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery.
* Belgian–Luxembourg UN Battalion: a Belgian battalion with an attached Luxembourg platoon, attached to the British 29th Brigade, the battalion initially held the brigade&#x27;s right flank and was able to withdraw under enemy fire and move into the gap created by the Chinese surrounding of the Glosters. The Belgians and Luxembourgers participated in the attempts to relieve the Glosters and to hold the line.
* Tank Company, 10th Battalion Combat Team, Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea: Subjected to fierce Chinese attacks on the night of April 22–23, elements of the Philippine battalion were overrun during the Battle of Yultong Bridge. Troops of the Tank Company attacked to successfully recapture lost positions and recover fallen comrades. After Yultong Bridge, the Philippine battalion participated in the attempts to relieve the Glosters.
*3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) and 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (2PPCLI a.k.a. &quot;The Patricias&quot;): 3RAR and 2PPCLI were in the vanguard of the 1st Commonwealth Division&#x27;s 27th Brigade, defending the Kapyong valley, in the Battle of Kapyong during the Chinese Spring Offensive. In recognition of their heroic actions at Kapyong, both 3RAR and 2PPCLI, together with A Company of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, were awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation. The streamer of the citation, bearing the honour &#x27;Kapyong&#x27;, is carried on the Regimental Colours of the Australian and Canadian battalions. In addition, although not a U.S. gallantry award, the 16th Field Regiment of the Royal New Zealand Artillery were awarded the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Kapyong.

====French &quot;Bataillon de Corée&quot;====
The French Battalion (&quot;Bataillon de Corée&quot;) was a volunteer battalion which arrived in Korea at the end of November 1950 and was attached to the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division. The battalion fought in numerous battles, including the Battle of the Twin Tunnels, Chipyong-ni, Hongchon, Hwachon Reservoir, the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge, and the Battle of Arrowhead Hill, until departing Korea in July 1953. The French Battalion earned three Unit Citations (for Twin Tunnels, Chipyong-ni, and Hwachon Reservoir) and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for Battle of Arrowhead Hill. It is unclear from the sources, but the &quot;Hwachon Reservoir&quot; citation may have been a Presidential Unit Citation, a US Navy award, while the first two were the army version of the time, the Distinguished Unit Citation.

====&quot;Netherlands Detachment United Nations&quot;====
The Dutch Battalion (&quot;Netherlands Detachment United Nations&quot; or &quot;Van Heutsz battalion&quot;) was a volunteer battalion that was part of the Regiment Van Heutsz which arrived in Korea at the end of November 1950. It was attached to the 38th Infantry Regiment (Rock of the Marne), which was part of the 2nd Infantry (Indianhead) Division.

It left Korea in November 1954, leaving 123 dead and 463 wounded. The Dutch battalion was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations (with the citations &#x27;Hongchon, Korea&#x27; and &#x27;Hoengsong, Wonju, Korea&#x27;) and two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations for the entire campaign. The decorations were attached to the battalion flag. The battle honour &#x27;Korea 1950–1954&#x27; was awarded to the Regiment Van Heutsz. The traditions of the Netherlands Detachment United Nations are still maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz, the most decorated regiment in the Royal Netherlands Army.

====The Turkish Brigade====
President Harry Truman signed a Distinguished Unit Citation on July 11, 1951, for the Turkish Brigade&#x27;s acts of heroism.

====Greek Expeditionary Force====
The Greek Expeditionary Force received a total of two Distinguished Unit Citations and one Navy Presidential Unit Citation. The two army awards went to the Force&#x27;s infantry battalion (known as the Sparta Battalion) for the capture of Scotch Hill (October 1951) and the defense of Outpost Harry (17–18 June 1953), while Flight 13 of the Hellenic Air Force was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for its heroic evacuation of US Marines from Hagaru-ri (December 1950).

The rifle company involved in the defense of Outpost Harry received the following Distinguished Unit Citation:

&quot;DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY Washington D. C., 10 March 1955 GENERAL ORDERS 18

DISTINGUISHED UNIT CITATION Company P Greek Expeditionary Forces Battalion (Second Award) is cited for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against an armed enemy in the vicinity of Surang-Ni, Korea during the period 17 June to 18 June 1953. Assigned the defense of a vital outpost position (Harry), the company encountered a major enemy assault on the evening of June 17. After an intense concentration of enemy mortar and artillery fire, the hostile forces, which had taken up an attack position on the northeast and northwest side of the outpost, moved rapidly through their own and friendly artillery fire to gain a foothold on the northern slope of the position. Refusing to withdraw, Company P closed in and met the attackers in a furious hand-to-hand struggle in which many of the enemy were driven off. The aggressors regrouped, quickly attacked a second time, and again gained the friendly trenches. Immediately, the Greek Forces launched a series of counterattacks, simultaneously dispatching a diversionary force to the east of the outpost which successfully channeled the enemy thrusts. After 2 hours of close in fighting, the aggressors were again routed and the friendly positions restored. The outstanding conduct and exemplary courage exhibited by members of Company P, Greek Expeditionary Forces Battalion, reflects great credit on themselves and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and the Kingdom of Greece.&quot;

The Greeks were awarded 6 U.S. Distinguished Service Crosses, 32 Silver Stars, and 110 Bronze Stars. Furthermore, 19 members of 13th Flight received the Air Medal for the Hagaru-ri evacuation operation in December 1950.

The city was quickly and completely surrounded by several elite battalions of PAVN units on every side but repulsed all attempts at storming the citadel. The defence of Hue Citadel despite overwhelming odds was regarded as the most pivotal moment of the battle, and had significant symbolic value for many in South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. The commander of the Hac Bao, Tran Ngoc Hue would also be awarded a Silver Star personally by General Creighton Abrams.

==== Republic of Vietnam Marine Division ====
The Republic of Vietnam Marine Division was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation in 1972 for the Second Battle of Quảng Trị, recapturing the city after it was over-run by 45,000 PAVN whom are deploying for the first time armoured and mechanised divisions.

During the battle this unit alone had lost almost 3,658 KIA while inflicting 17,819 enemy casualties, capturing 5,000 weapons and vehicles and disabling dozens of T-54/T-55 tanks. The battle was fought, alongside the Airborne Division arrayed against the three most elite and longest serving divisions of the PAVN, the &quot;Iron and Steel&quot; divisions of the 308th Division, 304th Division and 325th Division. This was the single bloodiest, longest and most intense engagement in the entire war and the most defining urban battle, far surpassing the Battle of Huế in all respects.

1st Armored Brigade, Army of the Republic of Vietnam

A Presidential Unit Citation is awarded by Richard Nixon in 1970 for Operation Duong Son. It was conducted in the Quế Sơn District in 1970 by the newly created 1st Armored Brigade Headquarters, composed of an Armored Cavalry Squadron, a Regional Force Battalion and 2 Regular Battalions.

The Operation involved was a search-and-destroy in which they were on the defensive and attacked by a much larger enemy force. The 42nd Ranger Battalion was commended for over-turning the attacking forces and turning them onto the defensive where they proceeded to rout them.

Afterwards decorated on March 7, 1968, for assaulting a well-defended enemy stronghold. This unit was well-regarded as an assault unit capable of over-running well concealed fortifications and positions. Among the 11 ARVN Ranger Units awarded with the Presidential Unit Citation, the 42nd was among the most highly decorated.

==== 39th Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam ====
Twice-decorated with a Presidential Unit Citation (United States), awarded for actions between February 18 and 28, 1968 during the Tet Offensive and again for actions between February 11 to April 24, 1970.

Fighting its way out of a cordon, the unit was annihilated with 178 KIA/MIA and 148 WIA out of an initial 430, although inflicting 639 KIA upon the 102nd Regiment.

====52nd Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam====
On 11 November 1965, the 52nd Ranger Battalion was augmented to the US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and conducted an air assault to relief a US element of the 11th ACR that had been ambushed by the VC 275th Regiment near Kim Hai hamlet, in the village of Phuoc Hoa on Route 15, in Phuoc Tuy Province and received a United States Presidential Unit Citation.

====44th Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam====
On April 6, 1965, the 44th Ranger Battalion was a reserve element of a larger force engaged in a search and destroy operation against two Viet Cong force battalions. The battalion was lifted by helicopter into battle when the lead infantry battalion accompanied by an armored personnel carrier troop were halted by intense fire delivered on their positions by the well-entrenched and camouflaged enemy. Upon entering into the landing zone, the enemy delivered withering machine gun fire. Despite the loss of their executive officer, a U.S. Army Advisor, and three helicopters during the lift the unit pursued and over-turned the attacking ambush forces, forcing them to withdraw and thereby saving the ambushed and pinned forces. For these actions the unit has earned a Presidential Unit Citation.

====Second Battalion, Vietnamese Marine Brigade, Army of the Republic of Vietnam====
The Second Battalion of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Division, nicknamed Crazy Buffaloes was the most decorated Republic of Vietnam Marine Division. A Presidential Unit Citation was earned at the battle of Phung Du in November 1966. This was alongside a previously earned Division-level commendation for participation in the Second Battle of Quảng Trị.

====D Company, 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment – Battle of Long Tan====
A mortar and recoilless rifle attack on the Task Force area opened Operation Vendetta, on the night of August 16/17, 1966. B Company, of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment was initially dispatched to clear the area to the east of the Task Force base. D Company took over from B Company on August 18, 1966. D Company made contact with the enemy force of regimental size and was soon under attack from three sides. The battle was fought into the night under a blanket of mist and heavy monsoonal rain, but D Company held its ground with heroism and grim determination. The remainder of the battalion deployed to aid the beleaguered Company. With the help of armoured personnel carriers of 3 Troop, 1 APC Squadron hit the flank of a battalion size force which was forming up to assault the rear of D Company, inflicted many casualties and forced the enemy from the battlefield. A Presidential Unit Citation was awarded to D Company by the then President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson, for the Battle of Long Tan.

Participating in daily actions in support of Republic of Vietnam ground operations, the courageous men of the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron carried out their attacks on military targets with indomitable spirit and determination. The fierce determination to destroy the enemy displayed by the men of this unit was exemplified in the 6,000 sorties, and 13,000 flying hours compiled in support of ground operations during this period.&quot;

====2nd Battalion, 31st Regiment 21st Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam====
This unit earned a Presidential Unit Citation.

====41st Regimental Headquarters, Army of the Republic of Vietnam====
A Presidential Unit Citation for the 41st Regimental Headquarters, including the 1st Battalion and 3rd, 41st Regiment, and 3rd Troop, 8th Reconnaissance Squadron for action against one of the more elite units of the NVA, the crack 18th Regiment/312th Division.

This numerically superior enemy force was equipped with numerous automatic weapons, large supplies of ammunition, and new equipment. During the early morning hours, the Republic of Vietnam units were subjected to a heavy volume of mortar fire followed by three separate human wave assaults against the position. In each case, the enemy penetrations of the perimeter were beaten back by fierce counterattacks. The viciousness of the close combat and the effectiveness of the defenders were fully demonstrated when more than 70 enemy bodies were found within the inner fortifications after the battle. Supported by air and artillery, the valiant defenders held their position, accounted for more than 170 North Vietnamese soldiers, and captured over 90 individual and crew served weapons. The determination, devotion to duty, and indomitable courage demonstrated by these men of the 2d Battalion, 9th Regiment, are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon themselves, their unit, and the Republic of Vietnam.&quot;

The 74th Tactical Wing of the Vietnamese Air Force operating from July 1966 to February 1968 flew over 52,000 sorties with the 520th Fighter Squadron (A-1H), 74th Tactical Wing, flew 17,730 sorties in combat against armed hostile forces. This unit earned a Presidential Unit Citation.

&quot;The officers and airmen of the wing repeatedly performed outstanding acts of heroism and gallantry, both individually and collectively, and demonstrated an esprit de corps in keeping with the highest traditions of the free military Air Forces. The 74th Tactical Wing inflicted severe damage on the hostile forces and, at the same time, saved countless Vietnamese and American lives. Despite their own tragic casualties and heavy battle damage, the men of the wing consistently maintained outstanding morale.&quot;

====9th Company, 1st Cavalry Regiment, Republic of Korea Army====

The 9th Company, 1st Cavalry Regiment, Republic of Korea Army was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation on August 9, 1968, for its valor on August 9–10, 1966 in the defense of Landing Zone 27 Victor, Pleiku Province, Republic of Vietnam. The citation reads, in part:

&quot;About one hour before midnight the sounds of digging were heard outside the perimeter. The suspicious area was illuminated by a searchlight and reconnoitered by machine-gun fire from one of the United States Army tanks under operational control of the 9th Company. This action triggered the first of a series of violent attacks made against the perimeter by a North Vietnamese Army battalion and reinforced by heavy fire from recoilless rifles, mortars, and rockets. During the next six hours, the foe made repeated assaults from differing directions, only to be beaten back by the coordinated fire from the stalwart defenders. A single enemy managed to penetrate into the position, but this danger was quickly eliminated by a Korean soldier wielding a bayonet. Throughout this long battle the 9th Company held its position and exhibited great gallantry under intense fire and repeated ground attacks. The tenacious defense and subsequent mop-up of the battlefield virtually eliminated the enemy battalion as an effective fighting unit. The heavy losses inflicted upon the numerically superior enemy force attest to the physical courage, determination, and skill of the defenders. ...&quot;

====1st Company, Royal Thailand Army Volunteer Regiment and attached units====
The 1st Company, Royal Thailand Army Volunteer Regiment and several attached and supporting units – a medical platoon, an armored personnel carrier platoon and an artillery battery – were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by President Richard Nixon on November 5, 1969, for extraordinary heroism on December 20–21, 1967 in Vietnam. According to the citation:

&quot;During this period the 1st Company was given the mission of conducting combat operations and revolutionary development support in Bien Hoa Province. Elements of the Viet Cong 274th Main Force Battalion and the 3d Main Force Battalion attacked the 1st Company on the night of 20 December. This attack was repulsed by the heroic Thai in a battle characterized by savage hand-to-hand combat with devastating effect on the enemy. By the unparalleled application of exceptional imagination, fearless courage, and unrelenting determination, the 1st Company succeeded in repelling three assaults by the superior enemy force. Although harassed by constant mortar fire, the valiant defenders aggressively engaged the enemy and inflicted heavy enemy casualties. Individual acts of heroism were numerous, and during the entire battle the company officers, through their superb leadership, provided an inspirational example to the rest of the company. The Thai victory deprived the enemy of one of its long-established infiltration and resupply routes. The aggressiveness, determination, enthusiasm, and exemplary courage displayed by the members of the 1st Company and its attached and supporting units reflect great credit upon themselves, the Royal Thailand Army, and the Allied cause in the Republic of Vietnam.&quot;

At the outbreak of the attack, tanks and armored cavalry assault vehicles of the 3rd ARVN Cavalry and the 2/1st Cav, which had been deployed along the highway in anticipation of possible contact, began to pour heavy fire into the enemy positions.

Task Force K-Bar was &quot;joint&quot; in that it included members of more than one service – Army Special Forces, Air Force combat controllers as well as Navy special warfare personnel – and &quot;combined&quot; in that it included military personnel from several countries. Besides United States personnel, special operations personnel from the following countries and units participated, earning the Navy Presidential Unit Citation.

* Canadian Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2): The contingent of Canada&#x27;s special operations unit, JTF2, which served in Task Force K-Bar was awarded the Navy Presidential Unit Citation for their service in Afghanistan. The Canadian Department of National Defence announced the award on December 8, 2004.

* Danish Special Forces: In February 2005, the Danish armed forces command announced the receipt of the Navy Presidential Unit Citation by Danish members of the Frømandskorpset (&quot;Frogman Corps&quot;, the Danish naval special operations unit) and the Jægerkorpset (&quot;Hunter Corps&quot;, the Danish army special operations unit). Danish representatives were reportedly present at the December 7, 2004, ceremony with the U.S. president.
* German Special Forces: Members of Germany&#x27;s Kommando Spezialkräfte, or KSK, served with Task Force K-Bar. The award of the Presidential Unit Citation is noted on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s unit awards database, but confirmation of acceptance of the award by Germany&#x27;s Bundeswehr on behalf of the highly secretive KSK has not been made public.

* Turkish special forces: The release noting the unit citation to Task Force K-Bar mentions Turkey among the other coalition members, and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s unit citation database lists one or more Turkish liaison personnel among persons entitled to the unit citation, but little more has been publicly disclosed about the role of Turkish special operations forces in Task Force K-Bar&#x27;s operations in Afghanistan.
* Although not a part of Task Force K-Bar the Australian Special Air Service Regiment was also awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.

<doc id="979199" wikidata="Q3306492" url="?curid=979199" title="Beta movement">
<text>The term beta movement is used for the optical illusion of apparent motion in which the very short projection of one figure and a subsequent very short projection of a more or less similar figure in a different location are experienced as one figure moving.

The illusion of motion caused by animation and film is sometimes believed to rely on beta movement, as an alternative to the older explanation known as persistence of vision. However, the human visual system can&#x27;t distinguish between the short-range apparent motion of film and real motion, while the long-range apparent motion of beta movement is recognised as different and processed in a different way.

==History==
Observations of apparent motion through quick succession of images go back to the 19th century. In 1833, Joseph Plateau introduced what became known as the phenakistiscope, an early animation device based on a stroboscopic effect. The principle of this &quot;philosophical toy&quot; would inspire the development of cinematography at the end of the century. Most authors who have since described the illusion of seeing motion in the fast succession of stationary images, maintained that the effect is due to persistence of vision, either in the form of afterimages on the retina or with a mental process filling in the intervals between the images.

In 1875, Sigmund Exner showed that, under the right conditions, people will see two quick, spatially separated but stationary electrical sparks as a single light moving from place to place, while quicker flashes were interpreted as motion between two stationary lights. Exner argued that the impression of the moving light was a perception (from a mental process) and the motion between the stationary lights as pure sense.

In 1912, Max Wertheimer wrote an influential article that would lead to the foundation of Gestalt psychology. In the discussed experiments, he asked test subjects what they saw when viewing successive tachistoscope projections of two similar shapes at two alternating locations on a screen. The results differed depending on the frequency of the flashes of the tachistoscope. At low frequencies, successive appearances of similar figures at different spots were perceived. At medium frequencies, it seemed like one figure moved from one position to the following position, regarded as &quot;optimale Bewegung&quot; (optimal motion) by Wertheimer. No shape was seen in between the two locations. At higher speeds, when test subjects believed to see both of the fast blinking figures more or less simultaneously, a moving objectless phenomenon was seen between and around the projected figures. Wertheimer used the Greek letter φ (phi) to designate illusions of motion and thought of the high-frequency objectless illusion as a &quot;pure phi phenomenon&quot;, which he supposed was a more direct sensory experience of motion. Wertheimer&#x27;s work became famous due to his demonstrations of the phi phenomenon, while the optimal motion illusion was regarded as the phenomenon well-known from movies.

In 1913, Friedrich Kenkel defined different types of the motion illusions found in the experiments of Wertheimer and subsequent experiments by Kurt Koffka (who had been one of Wertheimer&#x27;s test subjects). Kenkel, a co-worker of Koffka, gave the optimal illusion of motion (with the appearance of one figure moving from one place to the next) the designation &quot;β-Bewegung&quot; (beta movement).

==Confusion about phi phenomenon and beta movement==

Wertheimer&#x27;s pure phi phenomenon and beta movement are often confused in explanations of film and animation, but they are quite different perceptually and neither really explains the short-range apparent motion seen in film.

In beta movement, two stimuli, formula_1 and formula_2, appear in succession, but are perceived as the motion of a single object, formula_1, into position formula_2. In phi movement, the two stimuli formula_1 and formula_2 appear in succession, but are perceived as the motion of a vague shadowy something passing over formula_1 and formula_2. There are many factors that determine whether one will experience beta movement or the phi phenomenon in a particular circumstance. They include the luminance of the stimuli in contrast to the background, the size of the stimuli, how far apart they are, how long each one is displayed, and precisely how much time passes between them (or the extent to which they overlap in time).

<text>Knowledge workers are workers whose main capital is knowledge. Examples include ICT professionals, physicians, pharmacists, architects, engineers, scientists, design thinkers, public accountants, lawyers, editors, and academics, whose job is to &quot;think for a living&quot;.

==Definition==
Knowledge work can be differentiated from other forms of work by its emphasis on &quot;non-routine&quot; problem solving that requires a combination of convergent and divergent thinking. But despite the amount of research and literature on knowledge work, there is no succinct definition of the term.

Mosco and McKercher (2007) outline various viewpoints on the matter. They first point to the most narrow and defined definition of knowledge work, such as Florida&#x27;s view of it as specifically, &quot;the direct manipulation of symbols to create an original knowledge product, or to add obvious value to an existing one&quot;, which limits the definition of knowledge work to mainly creative work. They then contrast this view of knowledge work with the notably broader view which includes the handling and distribution of information, arguing that workers who play a role in the handling and distribution of information add real value to the field, despite not necessarily contributing a creative element. Thirdly, one might consider a definition of knowledge work which includes, &quot;all workers involved in the chain of producing and distributing knowledge products&quot;, which allows for a very broad and inclusive categorization of knowledge workers. It should thus be acknowledged that the term &quot;knowledge worker&quot; can be quite broad in its meaning, and is not always definitive in who it refers to.

Knowledge workers spend a portion of their time searching for information. They are also often displaced from their bosses, working in various departments and time zones or from remote sites such as home offices and airport lounges. As businesses increase their dependence on information technology, the number of fields in which knowledge workers must operate has expanded dramatically.

Even though they sometimes are called &quot;gold collars&quot;, because of their high salaries, as well as because of their relative independence in controlling the process of their own work, current research shows that they are also more prone to burnout and very close &quot;normative control&quot; from organizations they work for, unlike regular workers.

Managing knowledge workers can be a difficult task. Most knowledge workers prefer some level of autonomy, and do not like being overseen or managed. Those who manage knowledge workers are often knowledge workers themselves, or have been in the past. Projects must be carefully considered before assigning to a knowledge worker, as their interest and goals will affect the quality of the completed project. Knowledge workers must be treated as individuals.

Loo ( 2017) using empirical findings from knowledge workers of two sectors – advertising and IT software sectors – and from three developed countries – England, Japan and Singapore – investigated a specific type of knowledge workers – the creative knowledge workers - as opposed to the generic ones as indicated above. The findings from the analysed empirical data offer a complex picture of this type of work in the knowledge economy where workers use a combination of creativity, abilities, talents, skills, and knowledge towards the eventual production of products and services.
This investigation (Loo, 2017) identified a definition of creative knowledge work from four specific roles of copywriting, creative directing, software programming, and systems programme managing in advertising and IT software. The manner in which each of the creative applications is applied is dependent on the role(s) of the creative workers. This type of work includes a complex combination of skill sets or &#x27;creative knowledge work (ckw) capacities&#x27;. &quot;Creative knowledge workers use a combination of creative applications to perform their functions/roles in the knowledge economy including anticipatory imagination, problem solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities&quot; (Loo, 2017, p. 138).

Taking aesthetic sensibility as an example, for a creative director, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written.

Other sector-related creative applications include an emotional connection in the advertising sector and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. Terms such as &#x27;general sponge&#x27;, &#x27;social chameleon&#x27;, and &#x27;in tune with the zeitgeist&#x27; were identified which the creative knowledge workers used to identify emotionally with their potential audience in ad making. From the IT software perspective, creative knowledge workers used a &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; creative application to ascertain business intelligence and as a measurement of information, the software worker might obtain from various parties (Loo, 2017).

Creative workers also require abilities and aptitudes. Passion for one&#x27;s job was generic to the roles investigated in the two sectors and for copywriters, this passion was identified with fun, enjoyment, and happiness in carrying out the role alongside attributes such as honesty (regarding the product), confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. As with the other roles, a creative worker in software programming requires team working and interpersonal skills in order to communicate effectively with those from other disciplinary backgrounds and training. As regards the managerial roles of creative directing and systems programme managing, the abilities to create a vision for the job in hand, to convince, strategize, execute, and plan towards the eventual completion of the given task (such as a campaign or a software) are necessary capacities (Loo, 2017).

Linking these abilities and capacities are collaborative ways of working, which the findings from this study have identified. The two modes of working ranged from individual to collaborative where a worker might be doing either or both depending on the specific activity. The abilities to traverse between these two work modes alongside the relevant creative application are part of the complexity of this style of working.

Creative workers also require an understanding of various forms of knowledge (Loo, 2017). These are related to disciplines such as those from the humanities (e.g., literature), and the creative arts such as painting and music (e.g., popular and classical varieties). Creative knowledge workers also require technical-related knowledge such as mathematics and computer sciences (e.g., software engineering) and physical sciences (e.g., physics) though there are distinctions in the two sectors. In the IT software sector, technical knowledge of software languages is especially significant for programmers as ascertained in the findings. However, the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the relevant software language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers. The technical know-how for a creative director relates only to the understanding of the possibilities of technologies (such as graphics and typography) in order to capitalise on the technical wizardry. The technical specialists are then required to execute the creative director&#x27;s vision.

The above types of disciplinary knowledge may appear in explicit formats, which can be learnt from formal programmes at teaching institutions such as higher education and professional institutions alongside other skills and abilities relating to presentation, communication, and team working. As ascertained in the findings, there was other non-disciplinary knowledge, which was not explicit but tacit in nature. Interviewees mentioned tacit experiences from their past work and life experiences, which they used to draw upon in performing their creative knowledge work. This form of knowledge was harnessed collectively as a team (of an advertising campaign or a software programme). This collaborative approach to working, especially with roles such as creative directing and software programme managing, requires tacit knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses and the needs and wants of the related team members (knowledge of psychology). This form of working may occur within the organisation, as a stand-alone group for a specific project in the organisation, or as a sub-contracted team outside the organisation. Within this role, creative knowledge workers may perform their activities individually and/or collectively as part of their contribution to the project. The findings also brought out some characteristics of collaborative working such as the varieties of stakeholders such as sub-contracted groups, and the indirect relationships between clients, workers (of an ad agency), and consumers (Loo, 2017).

== History ==

The term &#x27;knowledge work&#x27; appeared in &quot;The Landmarks of Tomorrow&quot; (1959) by Peter Drucker. Drucker later coined the term &#x27;knowledge worker&#x27; in &quot;The Effective Executive&quot; in 1966. Later, in 1999, he suggested that &quot;the most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution, whether business or non-business, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity.&quot;

Paul Alfred Weiss (1960) said that &quot;knowledge grows like organisms, with data serving as food to be assimilated rather than merely stored&quot;. Popper (1963) stated there is always an increasing need for knowledge to grow and progress continually, whether tacit (Polanyi, 1976) or explicit.

Toffler (1990) observed that typical knowledge workers (especially R&amp;D scientists and engineers) in the age of knowledge economy must have some system at their disposal to &quot;create, process and enhance&quot; their own knowledge. In some cases they would also need to manage the knowledge of their co-workers.

Nonaka (1991) described knowledge as the fuel for innovation, but was concerned that many managers failed to understand how knowledge could be leveraged. Companies are more like living organisms than machines, he argued, and most viewed knowledge as a static input to the corporate machine. Nonaka advocated a view of knowledge as renewable and changing, and that knowledge workers were the agents for that change. Knowledge-creating companies, he believed, should be focused primarily on the task of innovation.

This laid the foundation for the new practice of knowledge management, or &quot;KM&quot;, which evolved in the 1990s to support knowledge workers with standard tools and processes.

Savage (1995) describes a knowledge-focus as the third wave of human socio-economic development. The first wave was the Agricultural Age with wealth defined as ownership of land. In the second wave, the Industrial Age, wealth was based on ownership of Capital, i.e. factories. In the Knowledge Age, wealth is based upon the ownership of knowledge and the ability to use that knowledge to create or improve goods and services. Product improvements include cost, durability, suitability, timeliness of delivery, and security. Using data, in the Knowledge Age, 2% of the working population will work on the land, 10% will work in Industry and the rest will be knowledge workers.

=== 21st century ===
Davenport (2005) says that the rise of knowledge work has actually been foreseen for years. He points to the fact that Fritz Machlup did a lot of the early work on both knowledge as well as knowledge work roles and as early as 1958 stated that the sector was growing much faster than the rest of the economy with knowledge workers making up almost a third of the workforce in the United States. &quot;According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (1981), by the beginning of the 1970s around 40 percent of the working population in the USA and Canada were classified to the information sector, whereas in most other OECD countries the figures were still considerably lower.&quot;

As of 2016, an average of 1.9 million knowledge worker positions had been added every year since 1980, more than any other type of role.

Tapscott (2006) sees a strong, on-going linkage between knowledge workers and innovation, but the pace and manner of interaction have become more advanced. He describes social media tools on the internet that now drive more powerful forms of collaboration. Knowledge workers engage in &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; knowledge sharing across organizational and company boundaries, forming networks of expertise. Some of these are open to the public. While he echoes concern over copyright and intellectual property law being challenged in the marketplace, he feels strongly that businesses must engage in collaboration to survive. He sees on-going alliance of public (government) and private (commercial) teams to solve problems, referencing the open source Linux operating system along with the Human Genome Project as examples where knowledge is being freely exchanged, with commercial value being realized.

Palmer (2014) researched knowledge worker productivity and work patterns. Part of this research has involved the analysis of how an average knowledge worker spends their day. He notes that effective and efficient knowledge work relies on the smooth navigation of unstructured processes and the elaboration of custom and one-off procedures. &quot;As we move to the 21st century business model, the focus must be on equipping knowledge workers with tools and infrastructure that enable communication and information sharing, such as networking, e-mail, content management and increasingly, social media.&quot; Palmer points to the emergence of Adaptive Case Management (also known as Dynamic or Advanced case management) representing the paradigm shift triggered by the appearance from adapting business practices to the design of IT systems, to building systems that reflect how work is actually performed.

Due to the rapid global expansion of information-based transactions and interactions being conducted via the Internet, there has been an ever-increasing demand for a workforce that is capable of performing these activities. Knowledge Workers are now estimated to outnumber all other workers in North America by at least a four to one margin.

While knowledge worker roles overlap heavily with professions that require college degrees, the comprehensive nature of knowledge work in today&#x27;s connected workplace requires virtually all workers to obtain these skills at some level. To that end, the public education and community college systems have become increasingly focused on lifelong learning to ensure students receive skills necessary to be productive knowledge workers in the 21st century.

Many of the knowledge workers currently entering the workforce are from the generation X demographic. These new knowledge workers value lifelong learning over lifelong employment. &quot;They seek employability over employment [and] value career over self-reliance&quot; (Elsdon and Iyer, 1999). Where baby boomers are proficient in specified knowledge regarding a specific firm, generation X knowledge workers acquire knowledge from many firms and take that knowledge with them from company to company (2002).

== Roles ==

Knowledge workers bring benefits to organizations in a variety of ways. These include:
* analyzing data to establish relationships
* assessing input in order to evaluate complex or conflicting priorities
* identifying and understanding trends
* making connections
* understanding cause and effect
* ability to brainstorm, thinking broadly (divergent thinking)
* ability to drill down, creating more focus (convergent thinking)
* producing a new capability
* creating or modifying a strategy

These knowledge worker contributions are in contrast with activities that they would typically &quot;not&quot; be asked to perform, including:
* transaction processing
* routine tasks
* simple prioritization of work

There is a set of transitional tasks which include roles that are seemingly routine, but that require deeper technology, product, or customer knowledge to fulfill the function. These include:
* providing technical or customer support
* handling unique customer issues
* addressing open-ended inquiries

Generally, if the knowledge can be retained, knowledge worker contributions will serve to expand the knowledge assets of a company. While it can be difficult to measure, this increases the overall value of its intellectual capital. In cases where the knowledge assets have commercial or monetary value, companies may create patents around their assets, at which point the material becomes restricted intellectual property. In these knowledge-intensive situations, knowledge workers play a direct, vital role in increasing the financial value of a company. They can do this by finding solutions on how they can find new ways to make profits. This can also be related with market and research. Davenport (2005) says that even if knowledge workers are not a majority of all workers, they do have the most influence on their economies. He adds that companies with a high volume of knowledge workers are the most successful and fastest growing in leading economies including the United States.

Reinhardt et al.&#x27;s (2011) review of current literature shows that the roles of knowledge workers across the workforce are incredibly diverse. In two empirical studies they have &quot;proposed a new way of classifying the roles of knowledge workers and the knowledge actions they perform during their daily work.&quot; The typology of knowledge worker roles suggested by them are &quot;controller, helper, learner, linker, networker, organizer, retriever, sharer, solver, and tracker&quot;:

== Additional context and frameworks ==

Drucker (1966) defines six factors for knowledge worker productivity:

# Knowledge worker productivity demands that we ask the question: &quot;What is the task?&quot;
# It demands that we impose the responsibility for their productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge workers have to manage themselves.
# Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and the responsibility of knowledge workers.
# Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the knowledge worker.
# Productivity of the knowledge worker is not — at least not primarily — a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.
# Finally, knowledge worker productivity requires that the knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an &quot;asset&quot; rather than a &quot;cost.&quot; It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the organization in preference to all other opportunities.

The theory of Human Interaction Management asserts that there are 5 principles characterizing effective knowledge work:

# Build effective teams
# Communicate in a structured way
# Create, share and maintain knowledge
# Align your time with strategic goals
# Negotiate next steps as you work

Another, more recent breakdown of knowledge work (author unknown) shows activity that ranges from tasks performed by individual knowledge workers to global social networks. This framework spans every class of knowledge work that is being or is likely to be undertaken. There are seven levels or scales of knowledge work, with references for each are cited.

# Knowledge work (e.g., writing, analyzing, advising) is performed by subject-matter specialists in all areas of an organization. Although knowledge work began with the origins of writing and counting, it was first identified as a category of work by Drucker (1973).
# Knowledge functions (e.g., capturing, organizing, and providing access to knowledge) are performed by technical staff, to support knowledge processes projects. Knowledge functions date from c. 450 BC, with the Library of Alexandria, but their modern roots can be linked to the emergence of information management in the 1970s.
# Knowledge processes (preserving, sharing, integration) are performed by professional groups, as part of a knowledge management program. Knowledge processes have evolved in concert with general-purpose technologies, such as the printing press, mail delivery, the telegraph, telephone networks, and the Internet.
# Knowledge management programs link the generation of knowledge (e.g., from science, synthesis, or learning) with its use (e.g., policy analysis, reporting, program management) as well as facilitating organizational learning and adaptation in a knowledge organization. Knowledge management emerged as a discipline in the 1990s (Leonard, 1995).
# Knowledge organizations transfer outputs (content, products, services, and solutions), in the form of knowledge services, to enable external use. The concept of knowledge organizations emerged in the 1990s.
# Knowledge services support other organizational services, yield sector outcomes, and result in benefits for citizens in the context of knowledge markets. Knowledge services emerged as a subject in the 2000s.
# Social media networks enable knowledge organizations to co-produce knowledge outputs by leveraging their internal capacity with massive social networks. Social networking emerged in the 2000s

The hierarchy ranges from the effort of individual specialists, through technical activity, professional projects, and management programs, to organizational strategy, knowledge markets, and global-scale networking.

This framework is useful for positioning the myriad types of knowledge work relative to each other and within the context of organizations, markets, and the global knowledge economy. It also provides a useful context for planning, developing, and implementing knowledge management projects.

Loo (2017) investigates how a particular group - creative knowledge workers – carries out their jobs and learns within it. Using empirical data from advertising and software development in England, Japan and Singapore, it develops a new conceptual framework to analyse the complexities of creative knowledge work. The framework draws from four disciplines of business and management, economics, sociology and psychology (Loo, 2017, p. 59). Focusing uniquely on the human element of working in the knowledge economy, Loo explores the real world of how people work in this emerging phenomenon and examines the relationships between knowledge and creative dimensions to provide new frameworks for learning and working. This research identified three levels of creative knowledge applications. They relate to intra-sectoral approaches, inter-sectoral approaches (where jobs require different styles of work depending on the sectors), and changes in culture/practices in the sectors. With the intra-sectoral work, they refer to the roles and functions of specific jobs in each of the two sectors of advertising (e.g. copywriting and creative directing) and software development (e.g. software developing and software programme managing). With the inter-sectoral work, it may include software programme managers having different functions when working in different organisations – e.g. a computer software company and a multinational financial organisation. With the last type of creative working, it may include aspects such as the culture of &#x27;good practice&#x27; in technical problem-solving and the &#x27;power of expression&#x27; in software programming. All the three types of micro-level of creative knowledge work offer a highly contextualized understanding of how these workers operate in the knowledge economy. This approach is different from that taken by Zuboff (1988), Drucker (1993), Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) and Reich (2001) who sought to provide a more generic understanding (Loo, 2017).

Finally, complex creative knowledge work needs a supportive environment. One such environment relates to the supporting technical base. Based on the findings, information, communications and electronic technologies (ICET) are viewed as an organisational tool, a source of ideas (such as the Internet), and a way of modelling a concept. It may also be applied to inter-sectoral activities such as software for cross-disciplinary applications. This organisational tool enables creative knowledge workers to devote their energies to multi-faceted activities such as analysis of huge data sets and the enabling of new jobs such as webpage designing. ICET enables workers to spend more time on advanced activities, which leads to the intensification of creative applications. Lastly, it was noted from the findings that a supportive environment focused on training, work environment, and education (Loo, 2017 Loo, S. (2017) Creative Working in the Knowledge Economy. Abingdon: Routledge).

<text>The Western Desert campaign (Desert War) took place in the deserts of Egypt and Libya and was the main theatre in the North African campaign of the Second World War. Military operations began in June 1940 with the Italian declaration of war and the Italian invasion of Egypt from Libya in September. Operation Compass, a five-day raid by the British in December 1940, was so successful that it led to the destruction of the Italian 10th Army (10ª ) over the following two months. Benito Mussolini sought help from Adolf Hitler, who sent a small German force to Tripoli under Directive 22 (11 January). The ( Erwin Rommel) was formally under Italian command, as Italy was the main Axis power in the Mediterranean and North Africa.

In the spring of 1941, Rommel led Operation Sonnenblume, which pushed the Allies back to Egypt except for the siege of Tobruk at the port. At the end of 1941, Axis forces were defeated in Operation Crusader and retired again to El Agheila. In early 1942 Axis forces drove the Allies back again, then captured Tobruk after the Battle of Gazala but failed to destroy their opponents. The Axis invaded Egypt and the Allies retreated to El Alamein, where the Eighth Army fought two defensive battles, then defeated the Axis forces in the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. The Eighth Army drove Axis forces out of Libya to Tunisia, which was invaded from the west by the Allied First Army in Operation Torch. In the Tunisian campaign the remaining Axis forces surrendered to the combined Allied forces in May 1943.

The British Western Desert Force (renamed Cyrcom and later the Eighth Army) had been reduced in early 1941 to send units to Greece, rather than complete the conquest of Libya, just as German troops and Italian reinforcements arrived. British Commonwealth and Empire troops released after the conclusion of the East Africa Campaign were sent to Egypt and by summer, the surviving Commonwealth troops had returned from Greece, Crete and Syria. From the end of 1941, increasing amounts of equipment and personnel, including US supplies and tanks, arrived for the Eighth Army. The Axis never overcame the supply constraints limiting the size of their land and air forces in North Africa and the desert war became a sideshow for Germany, when the expected quick conclusion of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, was not achieved.
==Background==

===Libya===

Cyrenaica (Libya) had been an Italian colony since the Italo-Turkish War in 1911–1912. With Tunisia, part of French North Africa, to the west, and Egypt to the east, the Italians prepared to defend both fronts through a North Africa Supreme Headquarters, under the command of the Governor-General of Italian Libya, Marshal of the Air Force, Italo Balbo. Supreme Headquarters had the 5th Army (General Italo Gariboldi) and the 10th Army (General Mario Berti), which in mid-1940 had nine metropolitan divisions of about each, three (Blackshirt) divisions and two Libyan divisions, each with an establishment with 8,000 men. Italian army divisions had been reorganised in the late 1930s from three regiments each to two; reservists were recalled in 1939, along with the usual call-up of conscripts.
Morale was considered high and the army had recent operational experience. The Italian navy had prospered under the Fascist regime, which had paid for fast, well-built, well-armed ships and a large submarine fleet but it lacked experience and training. The air force had been ready for war in 1936 but by 1939 had stagnated; the British did not consider it capable of maintaining a high rate of operations. The 5th Army, with eight divisions, was based in Tripolitania, the western half of Libya, opposite Tunisia and the 10th Army, with six infantry divisions, held Cyrenaica in the east. When war was declared, the 10th Army sent the 1st Libyan Division to the Egyptian frontier from Giarabub to Sidi Omar and XXI Corps from Sidi Omar to the coast, Bardia and Tobruk. The XXII Corps moved south-west of Tobruk to act as a counter-attack force.

===Egypt===

The British had based forces in Egypt since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. The small British and Commonwealth force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route. The canal was vital to British communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, over the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres. Until the Franco-Axis armistice, French divisions in Tunisia faced the Italian 5th Army on the western Libyan border. In Libya, the Royal Army had about 215,000 men and in Egypt, the British had about 36,000 troops and another 27,500 men training in Palestine.
British forces included the Mobile Division (Egypt) under Major-General Percy Hobart, one of only two British armoured training formations. In mid-1939 it was renamed the Armoured Division (Egypt) and on 16 February 1940, it became the 7th Armoured Division. The Egypt–Libya border was defended by the Egyptian Frontier Force and in June 1940, the headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division under Major-General Richard O&#x27;Connor took command in the Western Desert, with instructions to drive back the Italians from their frontier posts and dominate the hinterland if war began. The 7th Armoured Division, less the 7th Armoured Brigade, assembled at Mersa Matruh and sent the 7th Support Group forward towards the frontier as a covering force, where the RAF also moved most of its bombers. Malta was also reinforced.

The HQ of the 6th Infantry Division, which lacked complete and fully trained units, was renamed the Western Desert Force on 17 June. In Tunisia, the French had eight divisions, capable only of limited operations and in Syria, three poorly armed and trained divisions, about 40,000 troops and border guards, on occupation duties against the civilian population. Italian land and air forces in Libya greatly outnumbered the British in Egypt but suffered from poor morale and were handicapped by inferior equipment. In Italian East Africa, there were another 130,000 Italian and African troops with 400 guns, 200 light tanks and 20,000 lorries. Italy declared war on 11 June 1940.

==Prelude==

===Terrain===

The war was fought primarily in the area known as the Western Desert, which was about wide, from Mersa Matruh in Egypt to Gazala on the Libyan coast, along (), the only paved road. The Sand Sea, inland, marked the southern limit of the desert at its widest points at Giarabub and Siwa. In British parlance, the term &quot;Western Desert&quot; applied to the desert of Egypt west of the Nile but came to describe the whole area of conflict, including eastern Cyrenaica in Libya. From the coast, a raised, flat plain of stony desert extends inland about above sea level and runs south for from the coast to the edge of the Sand Sea. Scorpions, vipers and flies abound in the region, which was inhabited by a small number of Bedouin nomads.

Bedouin tracks linked wells and the more easily traversed ground; navigation was by sun, star, compass and &quot;desert sense&quot;, good perception of the environment gained by experience. When Italian troops advanced into Egypt in September 1940, the Maletti Group got lost leaving Sidi Omar, disappeared and had to be found by aircraft. In spring and summer the days are miserably hot and the nights very cold. The sirocco ( or ), a hot desert wind, blows clouds of fine sand, which reduce visibility to a few metres and coat eyes, lungs, machinery, food and equipment; motor vehicles and aircraft need special oil filters and the barren terrain means that supplies for military operations have to be transported from outside. German engines tended to overheat and the life of their tanks&#x27; engines fell from to and this problem was made worse by the lack of standardized spare parts for the German and Italian motor types.

===Supply===

====Axis====
Italian supply shipments to Libya went about west around Sicily, then approached the coast of Tunisia before going on to Tripoli, in order to avoid interference from the British aircraft, ships and submarines based at Malta. In Africa, supplies had to be hauled huge distances by road or in small consignments by coaster. The distance from Tripoli to Benghazi was about and to El Alamein was . A third of the Italian merchant marine was in ships berthed in British-controlled ports and was interned after Italy declared war. By September 1942 half of the remainder had been sunk, although much was replaced by new shipbuilding, salvage and transfers of German ships. From June 1940 to May 1943, 16 per cent of supply shipments were sunk.

Tobruk was pressed into use in June 1942 but Allied bombing and its long approach route led this effort to be abandoned in August. The Germans assumed that the maximum distance a motorised army could operate from its base was but on average about a third of Axis lorries were unserviceable and 35–50 per cent of the fuel deliveries were consumed transporting the remainder to the front. Fuel oil shortages in Italy, the small size of the ports in Libya and the need to meet civilian demand, required the inefficient dispatch of large numbers of small convoys. (OKH, German army high command) concluded that German forces in Libya could not be supplied for a decisive offensive unless Italian forces were withdrawn to Italy, which was politically impossible.

====British====

The geographical position of Italy made it possible for it to close the Mediterranean if war came and force the Mediterranean Fleet based in Egypt to rely on the Suez Canal. In 1939, Wavell began to plan a base in the Middle East to support about fifteen divisions (300,000 men), six in Egypt, three in Palestine and the rest further afield. Many of the supplies needed by the British were imported from the colonies and the rest obtained locally by stimulating the production of substitutes. The plan for a garrison of nine divisions in Egypt and Palestine was changed to fourteen divisions by June 1941 and then to 23 by March 1942. Once the Italians declared war in 1940 and until 1943, merchant ships travelled east from Britain around the Cape of Good Hope, which made Egypt as distant as Australia and New Zealand. The Middle East Supply Centre (MESC) operated in Egypt, Palestine and Syria to co-ordinate imports and create local substitutes for civilian rations and promote agricultural efficiencies. By March 1943 the MESC had replaced about 100 liberty ship deliveries&#x27; worth of imports with increased local production of potatoes, cooking oil, dairy products and fish; cattle drives from Sudan obviated the need for refrigerated shipping.

In 1940, British military forces had a base at the terminus of the Egyptian state railway, road and the port of Mersa Matruh (Matruh) west of Alexandria. Construction began on a water pipeline along the railway and the British surveyed sources of water. Wells were dug but most filled with salt water; in 1939 the primary fresh water sources were the Roman aqueducts at Mersa Matruh and Maaten Baggush. Water-boats from Alexandria and a distillation plant at Matruh increased supply but rigorous rationing had to be enforced and much water had to be moved overland to outlying areas. Not enough vehicles were available in 1939 and lorries were diverted to provide the Armoured Division with a better rear link. Only desert-worthy vehicles could be risked cross-country, which left tanks unable to move far from Matruh which was east of the Libyan border. From the border there was no water at Sollum or for another east of Sollum to Sidi Barrani, along a very poor road. An invader would have to move through a waterless and trackless desert to reach the main British force. In September 1940, the New Zealand Railway Battalion and Indian labourers began work on a coastal railway, which reached Sidi Barrani by October 1941 and Tobruk by December 1942, west of El Alamein, carrying of water per day.

=== Frontier skirmishes ===

On 11 June 1940, hostilities commenced. British troops were ordered to dominate the frontier and isolate Giarabub. They crossed into Libya that night, exchanged fire with Italian troops at Sidi Omar and discovered that some Italians were unaware that war had been declared. On 14 June, the British captured Fort Capuzzo and Fort Madalena, taking 220 prisoners. Two days later, the British raided a convoy on the Tobruk–Bardia road, killed 21 Italian soldiers and took 88 prisoners, including (Brigadier-General) Romolo Lastrucci, the 10th Army Chief Engineer. At an engagement near the frontier wire at Nezuet Ghirba, a mixed force of British tanks, artillery and motorised infantry defeated an Italian force of 17 light tanks, four guns and 400 infantry.

The British patrolled the frontier area as far west as Tobruk, establishing dominance over the 10th Army. On 5 August, thirty Italian tanks engaged the 8th Hussars in an inconclusive action and Wavell concluded that vehicle wear made it impractical to continue operations when an Italian offensive loomed. Sand wore out equipment quickly, shortening the track life of tanks. Spare parts ran out and only half the tank strength could be kept operational. A fell from August to early September as Operation Hats, a naval operation, reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet and helped to bring an army convoy of tanks and crews via the Cape. The British claimed to have inflicted 3,500 casualties with a loss of 150 men between 11 June and 9 September. Further afield, both sides established scouting groups, the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and Auto-Saharan Company () which ranged the desert, raided and observed their opponents&#x27; dispositions.

=== E===


Benito Mussolini had no plans to invade Egypt, intending to remain on the defensive in Libya if war came. After the fall of France in 1940, the 5th Army could send reinforcements east and on 7 August, Mussolini ordered an invasion to occupy Egypt and establish a land connection with Italian East Africa. In August a lull fell on the frontier. Most British armoured units had withdrawn to Mersa Matruh, in order to conserve their ability to defend the port. The 7th Support Group took over and established observation posts from Sollum to Fort Maddalena, ready to delay an Italian offensive and the Hussars reconnoitred further into Libya.

The Libyan divisions lacked the transport necessary to operate with the Maletti Group, which had one medium, two mixed and four light tank battalions on the escarpment and were redeployed to the coast road. On 9 September, the Maletti Group got lost en route to Sidi Omar and Rodolfo Graziani cancelled a flanking move and concentrated on the coast road, with five divisions and the Maletti Group; the 4th CC.NN. Division &quot;3 Gennaio&quot; and 64th Infantry Division &quot;Catanzaro&quot; divisions stayed in reserve at Tobruk. The 5th , a mixed air unit with about 300 serviceable aircraft, airfield equipment and transport, stood by to support the advance and occupy airfields.

The Italian invasion of Egypt on 13–18 September began as a limited tactical operation towards Mersa Matruh, rather than the strategic objectives sketched in Rome, due to the chronic lack of transport, fuel and wireless equipment, even with resupply from the 5th Army. Musiad was subjected to a &quot;spectacular&quot; artillery bombardment at dawn, then occupied. The 1st Libyan Division took Sollum and the airfield. By evening the 2nd Libyan Division, 63rd Infantry Division &quot;Cirene&quot;, the Maletti Group from Musaid and the 62nd Infantry Division &quot;Marmarica&quot; from Sidi Omar, pushed past British harassing parties and converged on Halfaya Pass.

The British withdrew past Buq Buq on 14 September and continued to harass the Italian advance. They fell back to Alam Hamid the next day and to on 16 September. An Italian force of fifty tanks attempted a flanking move so the British rearguard retired east of Sidi Barrani, which was occupied by the 1st CC.NN. Division &quot;23 Marzo&quot; and Graziani halted the advance. The British resumed observation and the 7th Armoured Division prepared to challenge an attack on Mersa Matruh. Despite prodding from Mussolini, the Italians dug in around Sidi Barrani and Sofafi, about west of the British defences at Mersa Matruh, repairing roads demolished by the British, cleaning wells and beginning work on a water pipeline from the border, accumulating supplies for the resumption of the advance in mid-December. Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with the Axis and Italian aircraft bombed Cairo on 19 October.

British naval and air operations to harass the Italian army continued and caused damage which prisoners reported had lowered morale. Armoured car patrols dominated no man&#x27;s land but a lack of landing grounds reduced the effectiveness of the RAF and Malta was out of range. Operation Compass, a British counter-attack to an Italian advance on Matruh, planned to destroy Italian forces and most of the WDF was moved up to the port. An additional armoured car company joined reconnaissance operations far behind the front line. The WDF had been reinforced with a new tank regiment with Matilda II tanks. Rather than wait for the Italians, the British began after about a month to prepare a raid of 4–5 days&#x27; duration on the central group of the Italian encampments and then on Sofafi.

===Operation Compass===

In December 1940, the 10th Army in Egypt had been reinforced with the 1st and 2nd Libyan divisions and 4th Blackshirt Division, in the fortified camps from Sidi Barrani to the Tummars and Maktila. The Maletti Group was based at Nibeiwa, the 63rd Infantry Division Cirene at Rabia and Sofafi, the 62nd Infantry Division Marmarica was on the escarpment from Sofafi to Halfaya Pass and the 64th Infantry Division &quot;Catanzaro&quot; was east of Buq Buq, behind the Nibeiwa–Rabia gap, supported by about 500 aircraft of the (General Felip Porro). The RAF attacked airfields on 7 December and destroyed 39 aircraft on the ground. Operation Compass (the Battle of Marmarica/Battle of the Camps), began when Selby Force advanced from Matruh to isolate Maktila early on 9 December. The 4th Indian Division and the 7th Royal Tank Regiment (7th RTR) attacked Nibeiwa at dawn and overran the camp, then moved on Tummar West, which fell in the afternoon. A counter-attack from Tummar East was repulsed and the camp taken the next day.

====Battle of Sidi Barrani====
A 7th Armoured Division screen to the west prevented the reinforcement of Sidi Barrani and on 10 December, the British cut the coast road and the 7th Armoured Division mopped up around Buq Buq, taking many prisoners. On 11 December, the Italians were defeated at Sidi Barrani; Rabia and Sofafi were abandoned and the 7th Armoured Division pursued along the coast and the escarpment. Late on 14 December, the 11th Hussars cut the Via Balbia between Tobruk and Bardia, captured Sidi Omar on 16 December and forced the Italians to retreat from Sollum and Fort Capuzzo to Bardia, leaving garrisons at Siwa Oasis and Giarabub in the south. From 9 to 11 December, the British took 38,300 prisoners, 237 guns, 73 tanks and about 1,000 vehicles for 624 casualties.

====Battle of Bardia====


Bardia fell between 14 December and 5 January 1941; the British suffered 456 Australian infantry casualties and lost 17 of 23 tanks, for 40,000 Italian casualties and prisoners, more than 400 guns, 130 tanks and hundreds of lorries. At dawn on 21 January, Australian infantry broke into Tobruk and made a path for 18 British I tanks. The Australians pressed on and captured half of the Tobruk defences by nightfall. The Australians took 25,000 prisoners, 208 guns and 87 tanks, for a loss of 355 Australian and 45 British troops. The 7th Armoured Division drove towards Derna and the Babini Group (BCS – under General Valentino Babini), with about 300 tanks, at Mechili. The BCS slipped away and from 26 to 28 January the British tanks bogged down in heavy rain; Derna was abandoned next day. The 7th Armoured Division sent Combeforce, a flying column, to Beda Fomm and cut off the 10th Army.

====Battle of Beda Fomm====

In late January 1941, the British learned that the Italians were evacuating Cyrenaica along the &quot;Via Balbia&quot; from Benghazi. The 7th Armoured Division, under Major-General Sir Michael O&#x27;Moore Creagh, was dispatched to intercept the remnants of the 10th Army by cutting through the desert south of the Jebel Akhdar via Msus and Antelat, as the 6th Australian Division pursued the Italians along the coast road north of the Jebel Akhdar. The terrain was hard going for the British tanks and Combeforce (Lieutenant-Colonel John Combe), a flying column of wheeled vehicles, was sent on ahead.

Late on 5 February, Combeforce arrived at the Via Balbia south of Benghazi and set up roadblocks near Sidi Saleh, about north of Ajedabia and south-west of Antelat. The forward elements of the 10th Army arrived thirty minutes later and found the Via Balbia blocked. The next day the Italians attacked to break through the roadblock and continued to attack into 7 February. With British reinforcements arriving and the Australians pressing down the road from Benghazi, the 10th Army surrendered. From Benghazi–Agedabia, the British took 25,000 prisoners, captured 107 tanks and 93 guns of the totals for Operation Compass of 133,298 men, 420 tanks and 845 guns.

On 9 February, Churchill ordered the advance to stop and troops to be dispatched to Greece to take part in Operation Marita of the Greco-Italian War, since a German attack through Macedonia was thought imminent. The British were unable to continue beyond El Agheila anyway, because of vehicle breakdowns, exhaustion and the effect of the much longer supply line from the base in Egypt. A few thousand men of the 10th Army escaped the disaster in Cyrenaica but the 5th Army in Tripolitania had four divisions. The Sirte, Tmed Hassan and Buerat strongholds were reinforced from Italy, which brought the 10th and 5th Armies up to about 150,000 men. German reinforcements were sent to Libya to form a blocking detachment () under Directive 22 of 11 January. These were the first units of the of (Lieutenant-General) Erwin Rommel.

==1941==
===Tobruk===
===Greece===
A week after the Italian surrender at Beda Fomm, the Defence Committee in London ordered Cyrenaica held with the minimum of forces and all spare troops sent to Greece. In the Western Desert Force (now XIII Corps), the 6th Australian Division was fully equipped and had few losses to replace. The 7th Armoured Division had been operating for eight months, had worn out its mechanical equipment and had withdrawn to refit. Two regiments of the 2nd Armoured Division with the WDF were also worn out, which left the division with only four tank regiments. The 6th Australian Division went to Greece in March with an armoured brigade group of the 2nd Armoured Division; the remainder of the division and the new 9th Australian Division, minus two brigades and most of its transport, was sent to Greece and was replaced by two under-equipped brigades of the 7th Australian Division. The division took over in Cyrenaica, on the assumption that the Italians could not begin a counter-offensive until May, even with German reinforcements.


In early 1941, after the big British and Commonwealth victory in Cyrenaica, the military position was soon reversed. The best-equipped units in XIII Corps went to Greece as part of Operation Lustre in the Battle of Greece. Adolf Hitler responded to the Italian disaster with Directive 22 (11 January) ordering (Operation Sunflower), the deployment of a new (DAK) to Libya, as a (barrier detachment). The DAK had fresh troops with better tanks, equipment and air support and was led by General Erwin Rommel, who had enjoyed great success in the Battle of France. The Axis force raided and quickly defeated the British at El Agheila on 24 March and at Mersa el Brega on 31 March, exploited the success and by 15 April, had pushed the British back to the border at Sollum and besieged Tobruk. The new commander of XIII Corps (now HQ Cyrenaica Command) Lieutenant-General Philip Neame, O&#x27;Connor and Major-General Michael Gambier-Parry, commander of the 2nd Armoured Division were captured. The Western Desert Force HQ took over under Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse, who had been recalled from East Africa. Apart from an armoured brigade group of the 2nd Armoured Division, which had been withdrawn for the Greek campaign, the rest of the division had been destroyed. Several Axis attempts to seize Tobruk failed and the front line settled on the Egyptian border.

===Siege of Tobruk===


Tobruk was defended by a force of some 25,000 Eighth Army troops, well stocked with supplies and linked to Egypt by the Royal Navy. The garrison had armoured cars and captured Italian tanks, which could raid Axis supply convoys as they passed through Tobruk for the frontier, thus preventing the Axis from invading Egypt. Rommel attempted to take the port but the 9th Australian Division under General Leslie Morshead, resolutely defended the port. The Italians were slow to provide blueprints for the port&#x27;s fortifications and several attacks were repulsed. After three weeks Rommel suspended the attacks and resumed the siege. Italian infantry divisions took up positions around the fortress while the bulk of the Afrika Korps maintained a mobile position south and east of the port.

====Operation Brevity====

Operation Brevity (15–16 May) was a limited offensive, to inflict attrition on Axis forces and secure positions for a general offensive towards Tobruk. The British attacked with a small tank-infantry force in three columns, &quot;Desert&quot;, &quot;Centre&quot; and &quot;Coast&quot;. Desert Column, with British cruiser tanks, was to advance inland and destroy tanks found en route to Sidi Aziz. Centre Column was to capture the top of the Halfaya Pass, Bir Wair and Musaid, then press on to Fort Capuzzo. Coast Column was to take Sollum and the foot of Halfaya Pass. Sollum, Halfaya Pass and Fort Capuzzo were captured but then the fort was lost to a counter-attack. A German counter-attack on 16 May threatened the force at the top of the pass and a retreat was ordered, covered by Desert Column. The Germans took Musaid back and a general British retreat began, to a line from Sidi Omar to Sidi Suleiman and Sollum, which left only the Halfaya Pass in British hands. Brevity failed to achieve most of its objectives and only briefly held the Halfaya Pass. The British lost 206 casualties. Five tanks were destroyed and 13 damaged. German casualties were 258 men, three tanks destroyed and several damaged. Italian casualties were 395, of whom 347 were captured. On 12 May, the Tiger convoy lost one ship and arrived in Alexandria, with 238 tanks, to re-equip the 7th Armoured Division and 43 aircraft. On 28 May, planning began for Operation Battleaxe.

During the evening of 26 May, under [Colonel] Maximilian von Herff comprising three panzer battalions, assembled on the coast at the foot of Halfaya Pass and attacked the next morning, intending to bluff the British into retreat. The pass was defended by the 3rd Coldstream Guards of Lieutenant-Colonel Moubray and supporting units but the bluff became a genuine attack and secured a commanding position, leaving the British in danger of being surrounded. Brigadier William Gott authorised a withdrawal and Moubray extricated the battalion. There were no reinforcements nearby and Gott ordered a withdrawal from the pass, which Axis forces re-occupied. The Italo-German positions on the border were fortified with barbed wire and minefields and covered by 50 mm and 88 mm anti-tank guns. Behind the new defences the Axis began to accumulate supplies and receive the 15th Panzer Division, which began to arrive on 20 May.

====Operation Battleaxe====


Operation Battleaxe, , was intended to lift the Siege of Tobruk and re-capture eastern Cyrenaica. The attack was to be conducted by the 7th Armoured Division and a composite infantry force based on the 4th Indian Division headquarters, with two brigades. The infantry were to attack in the area of Bardia, Sollum, Halfaya and Capuzzo, with the tanks guarding the southern flank. For the first time in the war, a large German force fought on the defensive. The Halfaya Pass attack failed, Point 206 was captured and only one of three attacks on Hafid Ridge had any success. At the end of 15 June, tanks remained operational. On 16 June, a German counter-attack forced back the British on the western flank but was repulsed in the centre. However, the British were reduced to 21 operational Cruiser tanks and seventeen infantry tanks.

On 17 June, the British only just evaded encirclement by two Panzer regiments and ended the operation. Despite British overextension, the Germans failed to turn a defensive success into an annihilating victory. Intelligence had provided details of British moves but the RAF had seen German counter-moves and slowed them enough to help the ground forces escape. The British had 969 casualties, 27 cruiser and 64 I tanks were knocked out or broken down and not recovered. The RAF lost 36 aircraft. German losses were 678 men and Italian losses are unknown, with in addition twelve tanks and ten aircraft lost. The British failure led to the sacking of Wavell, the XIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Noel Beresford-Peirse and Creagh, the 7th Armoured Division commander. General Claude Auchinleck took over as the Commander-in-Chief of Middle East Command. In September, the Western Desert Force was renamed the Eighth Army.

====Operation Crusader====

The Eighth Army (Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham) conducted Operation Crusader from 18 November to 30 December, aiming to relieve Tobruk and capture eastern Cyrenaica. The Eighth Army planned to destroy Axis armour before committing its infantry but was repulsed several times, culminating in the defeat of the 7th Armoured Division by the at Sidi Rezegh. Rommel ordered the panzer divisions to relieve the Axis positions on the Egyptian border but failed to find the main body of the Allied infantry, which had bypassed the fortresses and headed for Tobruk. Rommel pulled his armour back from the frontier towards Tobruk and achieved several tactical successes, which led Auchinleck to replace Cunningham with Major-General Neil Ritchie. The Axis forces then withdrew to the west of Tobruk to the Gazala Line and then back to El Agheila, leaving the Axis garrisons at Bardia and Sollum isolated and which surrendered later. The British suffered 17,700 casualties against 37,400 Axis, many of them taken prisoner when the garrisons left behind at Halfaya and Bardia surrendered. Tobruk had been relieved, Cyrenaica recaptured and airfields reoccupied to cover convoys supplying Malta.

====Axis supply: 1940–1941====
Axis supplies from Europe to Libya were moved by road and after Operation Compass (December 1940 – February 1941), only Tripoli remained as an , with a maximum capacity of four troopships or five cargo ships at once and an unloading capacity of about per month. Tripoli to Benghazi was along the and only halfway to Alexandria. The road could flood, was vulnerable to the Desert Air Force (DAF) and using desert tracks increased vehicle wear. The Axis advance of to the Egyptian frontier in early 1941 increased the road transport distance to . Benghazi was captured in April; coastal shipping there had a capacity of only and the port was within range of the DAF. About of supplies per day could be unloaded at Tobruk but lack of shipping made its capture irrelevant.

A German motorised division needed of supplies a day and moving its supplies required 1,170 lorry-loads. With seven Axis divisions, air force and naval units, of supplies were needed per month. The Vichy French agreed to Axis use of Bizerta in Tunisia but this did not begin until late in 1942. From February to May 1941, a surplus of was delivered; attacks from Malta had some effect but in May, the worst month for ship losses, 91 per cent of supplies actually arrived. Lack of transportation in Libya left German supplies in Tripoli and the Italians had only 7,000 lorries for deliveries to their 225,000 men. A record amount of supplies arrived in June but shortages worsened at the front.
There were fewer Axis attacks on Malta from June and ship losses increased from 19% in July, to 25 per cent in September, when Benghazi was bombed and ships diverted to Tripoli; air supply in October made little difference. Deliveries averaged a month from July to October but the consumption of 30 to 50 per cent of fuel deliveries by road transport and truck non-serviceability of 35 per cent reduced deliveries to the front. In November, a five-ship convoy was sunk during Operation Crusader and ground attacks on road convoys stopped journeys in daylight. Lack of deliveries coupled with the Eighth Army offensive forced a retreat to El Agheila from 4 December, crowding the , where British ambushes destroyed about half of the remaining Axis transport.

Convoys to Tripoli resumed and losses increased but by 16 December the supply situation had eased except for the fuel shortage. In December, the was restricted to one sortie per day. Vichy sold the Axis of fuel, U-boats were ordered into the Mediterranean and air reinforcements were sent from Russia in December. The Italian navy used warships to carry fuel to Derna and Benghazi and made a maximum effort from 16 to 17 December. Four battleships, three light cruisers and 20 destroyers escorted four ships to Libya. The use of an for of cargo ships, depleted the navy fuel reserve and only one more battleship convoy was possible. Bizerta was canvassed as an but it was within range of RAF aircraft from Malta and was another west of Tripoli.

==1942==
The Eighth Army advance of to El Agheila transferred the burden of an over-stretched supply line to the British. In January 1942, the British withdrew from the front to reduce the supply burden and to prepare for Operation Acrobat, a 1941 plan to advance west against Tripolitania. The British overestimated Axis losses during Operation Crusader and believed that they faced 35,000 troops, rather than the true total of 80,000 men and also misjudged the speed of Axis reinforcement from Europe. The Eighth Army expected to be ready by February, well before an Axis attack. The 1st Armoured Division held the area around El Agheila and from 28 to 29 December was engaged near Ajedabia and lost 61 of 90 tanks, vs. seven German tanks lost.

 began Operation Theseus on 21 January and defeated the 2nd Armoured Brigade in detail. By 23 January, the brigade was down from 150 to 75 tanks, against a German loss of 29 tanks out of 100. Benghazi fell on 28 January and Timimi on 3 February. By 6 February, the British were back to the Gazala line, a few miles west of Tobruk, from which the had retreated seven weeks earlier. The British had 1,309 casualties from 21 January, had 42 tanks knocked out and another 30 damaged or broken down and lost forty field guns. The commander of XIII Corps Lieutenant-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen resigned over differences with the Eighth Army commander, Neil Ritchie.

===Battle of Gazala===


By February the front was at the Gazala line, west of Tobruk. In the spring both sides prepared for another battle. The British planned Operation Buckshot for June to destroy the and re-capture Cyrenaica but in early May defensive measures on the Egyptian border took priority, as an Axis attack became imminent. (the Battle of Gazala) from 26 May to 21 June 1942, began when and Italian tanks drove south, around the flank of the Gazala line and were isolated by Free French and other Allied troops at Bir Hakeim, who intercepted Axis supply convoys.

Rommel retreated to a position abutting the British minefields and Ritchie ordered Operation Aberdeen, a counter-attack for 5 June. To the north, the 32nd Army Tank Brigade lost 50 of 70 tanks. The 7th Armoured Division and the 5th Indian Infantry Division on the eastern flank attacked at and met with disaster when the British artillery bombardment fell short of the German anti-tank screen. The 22nd Armoured Brigade lost 60 of 156 tanks and turned away, leaving the 9th Indian Brigade stranded. An afternoon counter-attack by the and 21st Panzer divisions and a 15th Panzer Division attack on the Knightsbridge Box overran the tactical HQs of the two British divisions and the 9th Indian Division. The 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and smaller units were dispersed and command broke down. The 9th Indian Brigade, a reconnaissance regiment and four artillery regiments were lost and the British fled from the Gazala Line on 13 June, with only 70 operational tanks.

====Fall of Tobruk====
Gott, now a Lieutenant-General and commander of XIII Corps, appointed Major-General Hendrik Klopper to the command of the 2nd South African Division, to defend Tobruk. Along with two South African brigades, were the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade. Tobruk had been besieged for nine months in 1941 but this time the Royal Navy could not guarantee the supply of the garrison and Auchinleck viewed Tobruk as expendable but expected that it could hold out for two months. On 21 June, 35,000 Eighth Army troops surrendered to Lieutenant-General Enea Navarini, the commander of XXI Corps. Auchinleck relieved Ritchie, took over the Eighth Army and stopped the Axis advance at El Alamein, from Alexandria; after the First Battle of El Alamein Auchinleck was also sacked.

Italian plans to invade Malta by sea began during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 – May 1936). An opportunity to capture Malta occurred in April 1941 but Operation Mercury (20 May – 1 June 1941), the invasion of Crete, was conducted first, with such losses of parachute troops and transport aircraft that a second operation in 1941 was impossible. Luftwaffe units apart from then went east for Operation Barbarossa and by June 1941, the island air defences had recovered. Luftwaffe units returned to the Mediterranean in spring 1942 and managed to neutralise the offensive capacity of the island garrison. In April, Hitler and Mussolini agreed to mount , an Italian-German air and sea invasion. Two with hundreds of Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, gliders (including 24 Messerschmitt Me 321 ) and about 200 transport aircraft were assembled for the invasion.

The Italian navy assembled an armada of (MFP), converted civilian ships and mine layers and 74 smaller boats. German MFPs, Siebel ferries, , , large inflatable rafts and the (Sea Snake a portable landing bridge), were contributed by the German navy. Rommel wished to attack, having refitted the force in Libya, to forestall an Eighth Army offensive, which was agreed by Hitler and Mussolini, with the proviso that an advance would stop at Tobruk, ready for the invasion of Malta in August. After the success of and the capture of Tobruk in June, the advance by the kept going after the fall of Tobruk. The pursuit of a defeated enemy had more appeal than the hazards of the Malta operation. Herkules was cancelled, in favour of , an invasion of Egypt to capture the Suez Canal.

 advanced into Egypt after the victory at Gazala in pursuit of the Eighth Army, which made a defensive stand at Mersa Matruh. The speed of advance of the enabled it to get behind XIII Corps and X Corps but the Axis forces were too weak to prevent the British from escaping. XIII Corps withdrew on the evening of 27 June but poor communication left X Corps on its own in the fortress of Mersa Matruh. X Corps broke out the following night but left 6,000 men and a great deal of equipment and supplies behind. The Eighth Army continued to retreat eastwards, colliding with Axis forces several times en route. An attempt to regroup at Fuka was cancelled and Auchinleck ordered a retreat all the way to El Alamein, west of Alexandria. The retreat brought the Eighth Army close to its base, which made supply much more efficient and the geographical bottleneck of the Qattara Depression, to the south, made an Axis outflanking move much more difficult. By 25 June, the was down to 60 tanks and the Italian XX Corps had only 14 operational tanks. Using supplies captured at Tobruk on the frontier and at Mersa Matruh, the reached El Alamein on 30 June. Supplying the Axis forces so far east of Gazala became much harder as most of their supplies still had to come from Tripoli, away.

===First Battle of El Alamein===


An attempt to drive the Eighth Army out of the Alamein position took place in the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942). After four days Rommel called off the attempt due to the strength of the Eighth Army defence, depleted Axis supplies and dwindling forces, with German divisions down to 1,200–1,500 men each. By 5 July, the number of serviceable German tanks fell to around thirty. After a lull, the planned to attack again, with about fifty German tanks, 2,100 German infantry, 54 Italian tanks and 1,600 Italian troops but the Eighth Army attacked first, at Tel el Eisa from 10 to 14 July, which exhausted both sides. The Eighth Army began to attack Italian units, located with information from Ultra, at Ruweisat Ridge (14–17 July) and from 21 to 23 July, again at Tel El Eisa on 22 July and Miteirya Ridge (22 and 26 July), after which another lull fell. The Germans suffered about 10,000 casualties; Italian casualties are unknown but 7,000 Axis prisoners were taken, against 13,250 Eighth Army casualties.

===Battle of Alam el Halfa===

Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took command of the Eighth Army in mid-August. Rommel tried to destroy the British and reach Cairo before Allied reinforcements, due in September, made an Axis victory in Africa impossible. was in poor condition and the physique of many of the Germans had declined due to climate and battle exhaustion; 19,000 German troops had been in Africa since March 1941. Reinforcements had brought the four German divisions up to 90,000 men, 17,000 men below establishment and 12,600 vehicles. Only 34,000 of these men were fighting troops. The had accumulated about 200 German and 243 Italian tanks, vs. 700 British tanks. In the Battle of Alam el Halfa (, 30 August – 5 September), Axis units sought to surround the Eighth Army by advancing around its southern flank.

The British were forewarned by Ultra (decoded German radio messages) and left only patrols in the south. The bulk of the British tanks and guns were concentrated at the Alam el Halfa Ridge, which blocked the Axis advance behind the front. The tanks stayed on the ridge and fought a static defensive engagement, rather than a battle of manoeuvre. Allied aircraft bombed and strafed Axis troops continuously from 30 August to 4 September, which destroyed few tanks but pinned them down and denied fast manoeuvring and concentration to the . Axis attacks on the ridge failed, supplies ran short and Rommel ordered a withdrawal on 2 September. Late on 3 September, a New Zealand brigade and a British brigade counter-attacked to cut off the Axis retreat but Operation Beresford was a costly failure and by 5 September the Axis retreat was complete. The Eighth Army lost and 68 tanks; the Axis lost 60 guns and 

===Second Battle of El Alamein===


When the Eighth Army offensive began on 23 October, the had including of whom only front line troops. There were tanks, which were Italian, and guns. The Eighth Army had another repair, and guns. The Allied troops were well fed and in good health, whereas the Axis troops were undernourished and susceptible to illness. The had only of fuel per vehicle. By 27 October, the was down to tanks and by 2 November the had expended most of its ammunition and had only and tanks left. Rommel decided to retreat but Hitler ordered the to stand fast. On 4 November, the Eighth Army broke through Axis defences and Rommel ordered the retreat to begin, abandoning the non-motorized units, particularly Italian formations, in the centre and south.

 had suffered of the force and had lost and The Eighth Army suffered a far smaller proportion of the force and (only destroyed) and about (mainly anti-tank guns). The was reduced to about guns and Attempts to encircle the Axis forces at Mersa Matruh failed and the bulk of the had escaped by 7 November. The Axis forces retreated along the coast road but lack of tanks and fuel for a mobile defence of the open southern flank, made a stand at the Halfaya Pass or any other position impossible. Tobruk was retaken by the Eighth Army on 13 November and the Axis retreat continued; Benghazi fell on 20 November and the captured ports were quickly repaired to supply the British advance.

===Battle of El Agheila===

 retired to the El Agheila defences (Mersa Brega line) but Axis supply and reinforcement priority was given to the forces opposing the British First Army (Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson) and Operation Torch, leaving the Italo-Germans with no capacity to counter-attack. Hitler ordered the Mersa Brega line to be held at all costs but Rommel favoured a fighting retreat to the Gabès Gap in Tunisia, which would increase the supply distance for the Eighth Army to . On 24 November, Ugo Cavallero agreed to withdraw west to Buerat, beyond Sirte, if the was attacked by a superior force. The Eighth Army reached El Agheila on 15 December and the New Zealand Division was sent to outflank the Mersa Brega line from as the 51st (Highland) Division attacked frontally and the 7th Armoured Division attacked inland at Bir el Auera. The outflanking move failed with the loss of 18 tanks and the retreated behind an obstacle course of deep mine-fields and booby-traps, which slowed the pursuit.

====Axis supply: 1942====
El Agheila is closer to Tripoli than the Egyptian frontier; the arrival of the second Italian battleship convoy on 6 January 1942 and the discovery of of fuel at Tripoli, eased the supply crisis, despite the delivery of only of supplies in January. The had room to manoeuvre and a much shorter supply line against an opponent who now had the burden of an over-extended supply line. The arrival of the in Sicily had also restored Axis air superiority in the region. Rommel asked for another but this utopian demand was rejected and Rommel was warned that an advance would cause another supply crisis. On 29 January, the recaptured Benghazi and next day ammunition supply to the front line broke down. By 13 February Rommel had agreed to stop at Gazala, from Tripoli.

Until May, monthly deliveries averaged , fewer than the smaller Axis force received from June to October 1941 but sufficient for an offensive. The advance to Gazala succeeded because Benghazi was open, reducing the transport distance for about of the supplies of the to . The Italians tried to restrain Rommel by advocating the capture of Malta, which would postpone another offensive in Africa until autumn but agreed to an attack on Tobruk for late May. An advance would stop at the Egyptian frontier, another east and the Luftwaffe would redeploy for Operation Herkules. The capture of Malta would not alter the constraints of port capacity and distance; protecting convoys and a large port close to the front would still be necessary for victory.

The capture of Alexandria would have made Malta irrelevant but a defensive strategy would be needed while Benghazi was extended, supplies accumulated and substantial reinforcements brought to Libya. More troops would increase the demand for supplies, which would exceed the capacities of Tripoli and Benghazi and the transport needed to move them. On 26 May, , the Battle of Gazala, began; Tobruk was captured intact on 22 June and shipping losses barely increased. Deliveries to Libya fell from , due to a fuel shortage in Italy and the supplies were unloaded at Tripoli, which made the position of the untenable. Operation Herkules was postponed; the capture of of supplies and of fuel at Tobruk enabled the to advance another by 4 July, when lack of supplies, exhaustion and the rally of the Eighth Army ended the advance.
Tobruk could only take of supplies a month, was within DAF bomber range and the railway could carry only per day. Small deliveries could be made to Tobruk, Bardia and Mersa Matruh or be landed at Tripoli and Benghazi, away. Ship losses in August rose by 400 per cent and deliveries fell by half, to . Supplies were diverted back to Tripoli and the Battle of Alam Halfa consumed of fuel. A retreat from El Alamein was forbidden by Hitler and deliveries fell as far fewer ships were sent from Italy. Shipbuilding, repairs and German replacement ships, had limited the net Italian loss of merchant ships to 23 per cent since 1940. On the eve of the Second Battle of El Alamein, the railway from Tobruk flooded and of supplies were stranded, leaving the with only ten per cent of the fuel it needed.

==1943==

===Buerat===
Rommel planned to defend the Gabes Gap in Tunisia east of the French pre-war Mareth line by holding the port of Buerat, while Army Group Africa ( [Colonel-General] Hans-Jürgen von Arnim), already in Tunisia, confronted the British First Army, which contained the II US Corps and French troops. The front was from Tobruk and with such supply difficulties, the Eighth Army was unable to use all its strength. Buerat was not strongly defended and despite intelligence on the state of the Axis forces, Montgomery paused until 16 January 1943, when the Eighth Army had a 4:1 superiority in infantry and a 7.5:1 superiority in tanks. Bombing began on 12 January and XXX Corps attacked on 15 January, picking its way along the coast road through minefields, demolitions and booby-traps. The 2nd New Zealand Division and the 7th Armoured Division swung inland via Tarhuna, supplied by the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) and the New Zealand Army Service Corps. The Eighth Army needed to capture the port quickly to avoid a supply shortage. Rommel withdrew from Buerat on 15 January, retreated from Tripoli on the night of 22/23 January, after destroying the port and then conducted a delaying action into Tunisia. The 7th Armoured Division entered Tripoli on 23 January; the last elements of reached the Mareth line, another west, on 15 February, as LRDG patrols surveyed the defences.

===Tripoli===

The main British attack was made along the coast road by the 51st (Highland) Division and an armoured brigade as the 7th Armoured Division advanced via Tarhuna, Castel Benito and Tripoli. The 90th Light Division fought delaying actions along the road, which exacerbated the Allied transport difficulties. From 20 to 21 January, the 90th Light Division made a stand at Corradini, having made 109 craters in the road from Buerat to Homs. The vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division reached the vicinity of Aziza on 21 January and next day the 51st (Highland) Division reached Castel Verde. A race developed and the Germans retired from Tripoli during the night; the 11th Hussars were the first into Tripoli, west of Benghazi, on the morning of 23 January. Five hours later, a Naval Base Party arrived and surveyed the wreckage of the port. On 26 January, five ships anchored outside the port and began to unload via lighters; on 30 January, of stores were landed. In March the Eighth Army entered Tunisia and on 9 March, Rommel returned to Germany to communicate to Hitler the realities of conditions in North Africa. Rommel failed to persuade Hitler to allow the Axis forces to be withdrawn and was not allowed to return to Africa, ostensibly on health grounds.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
In 1977, Martin van Creveld wrote that Rommel had claimed that if the supplies and equipment, sent to Tunisia in late 1942 and early 1943, had been sent earlier, the Axis would have won the Desert War. Creveld disagreed, since only the German occupation of southern France after Operation Torch made French merchant ships and Toulon available for dispatch and Bizerta available for receipt, which did not apply in 1941. The extra distance from Bizerta to the Egyptian border would also have negated the benefit of using a larger port. Axis supply had always been determined by the small size of the ports in Libya, a constraint that could not be overcome and attacks on Axis shipping had compounded chronic supply difficulties. With the German army bogged down in the USSR, there was never sufficient road transport available for the and the , despite the relatively lavish scale of transport compared to other fronts.

The cancelled attack on Malta in the summer of 1942 had less influence on events than the small size of Tobruk harbour and its vulnerability to air attack. Only a railway, similar to the one built by the British, could have alleviated Axis supply difficulties but lack of time and resources made it impossible to build one. The influence of Axis ship losses on the defeats inflicted on the in late 1942 has been exaggerated, because lack of fuel was caused by the chronic difficulty of transporting goods overland, rather than lack of deliveries from Europe. During the Second Battle of El Alamein, of the fuel destined for the , was stranded at Benghazi. Rommel wrote that Axis supply difficulties, relative to those of the British, determined the course of the military campaign and were a constraint that was insoluble.

Montgomery has been criticised for failing to trap the Axis armies and bring them to a decisive battle in Libya. His tactics have been seen as too cautious and slow, since he knew of the exiguous supply situation of the and Rommel&#x27;s intentions from Axis signals decrypts and other intelligence. In 1966, the British official historian Ian Playfair wrote that the defensive ability of the in particular and British apprehensions of another defeat and retreat, would have constrained the freedom of action of any commander. Warfare in the desert has been described as a &quot;quarter-master&#x27;s nightmare&quot;, given the conditions of desert warfare and the supply difficulties. Montgomery emphasised balance and refrained from attacks until the army was ready; Eighth Army morale greatly improved under his command. The Axis forces retreated through Libya into Tunisia and fought the Tunisian campaign, eventually to be trapped between the Anglo-American forces of the First Army to the west and the Eighth Army from the east.

<text>The Ryanggang explosion was a large explosion that took place in North Korea on 9 September 2004 in the northern province of Ryanggang. The nature and cause of the suspected explosion is the subject of speculation. No neighboring nations have claimed any detection of radioactive isotopes characteristic of a nuclear explosion.

==The suspected explosion==
The suspected explosion occurred near Wŏltan Workers&#x27; District (&quot;Wŏltal-lodongjagu&quot;) (41°19&#x27;47&quot;N 127°05&#x27;02&quot;E) in the county of Kimhyŏngjik in Ryanggang Province, a mountainous region, about above sea level. The explosion was about from the border with China. The area contains several military installations, including the Yeongjeo-dong ballistic missile base.

Early reports stated that seismic activity had been detected early on 9 September 2004, and this was correlated with a &quot;strangely shaped cloud&quot;, suspected to be a mushroom cloud. Together these would indicate a large explosion. The date, 9 September 2004, the 56th anniversary of the formation of North Korea, was taken as significant because North Korea has a history of making grand military gestures on significant dates. However, the original reports have been contradicted by later reports denying that there was any explosion.

==Reaction==
The incident was not reported internationally until 12 September 2004, when the South Korean news agency Yonhap cited a source in Beijing, China, which said a mushroom cloud had been observed. In addition, suspicion was raised by the fact that there was no mention of the explosion on internal North Korean media. However, North Korean news is usually a method employed by governing figures to make the ruling party&#x27;s decisions more favourable to the people (national and internationally); therefore, unfavourable stories are commonly not broadcast. The Ryongchon disaster earlier in 2004 was reported only several days after the event.

There was immediate popular speculation that the explosion was nuclear in origin. United States Secretary of State Colin Powell said there was &quot;no indication&quot; that it was nuclear, and South Korea similarly said that it did not appear to be nuclear. It would be some days before the effects of a nuclear explosion would be unequivocally visible to apolitical authorities. It would not be possible to hide the nuclear nature of such an explosion for long, as the radioactive isotopes created by a nuclear explosion would be detectable to outside observers around the world.

===From North Korea===
North Korea initially denied that the explosion was nuclear. When prompted for an explanation, North Korea&#x27;s foreign minister, Paek Nam-sun, officially stated that the explosion &quot;was in fact the deliberate demolition of a mountain as part of a huge hydroelectric project&quot;. North Korea announced on 13 September 2004 that the British ambassador, David Slinn, would be permitted to visit the site. Diplomats from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Mongolia visited what was purported to be the site on 16 September 2004, and reported having seen a hydroelectric project under construction. However, South Korea said the diplomats had not been in the correct location and were about 100 km (62 mi) from the suspected explosion site.

===From South Korea===
On 17 September 2004, South Korean Vice Minister of Unification Rhee Bong-jo claimed that there was no explosion at all at the purported site, saying the supposed mushroom cloud was a natural cloud formation (mushroom clouds form from many types of large explosions, not only nuclear detonations). On the same day, the Korea Earthquake Research Center reported that the only seismic activity in Ryanggang province in the period in question was at 23:24 Korea Standard Time (UTC +9) on 8 September 2004 at Mount Baekdu, about 100 km from the suspected blast site.

== North Korean disarmament talks ==

At the time of the blast, North Korea was under pressure to again resume six-way diplomatic talks concerning its nuclear program with the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, and Japan. North Korea was insisting on a delay before a fourth round of talks, citing recently revealed South Korean nuclear research programs. On 14 September 2004, a British envoy said that North Korea was still committed to the talks, but on 27 September 2004, the KCNA, North Korea&#x27;s state news agency, reported that resumption of the talks was out of the question until the United States made certain concessions.

Since the initial days, there has been essentially no follow-up reporting in Western media.

On 28 September, North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choi Su-heon announced at the United Nations General Assembly that it had turned plutonium from 8,000 spent fuel rods into nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the US nuclear threat. Six-nation talks on the nuclear issue, which were due to resume, were instead suspended. As of this date, analysts believed North Korea had ruled out further talks until after the United States presidential election in November 2008.

Since then, North Korea has conducted multiple nuclear weapons tests and issued several threats of war on South Korea. As of April 2018, North Korea along with South Korea have announced their intentions to completely denuclearize the Korean peninsular and finally declare peace between the two Koreas.

==Cause==
There has been a great deal of speculation on the nature of the incident. Hypotheses can be divided on several axes.

Things that could cause the physical phenomena observed:
* A large chemical explosive blast.
* A forest fire. The United States National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice, said &quot;maybe it was ... some kind of forest fire&quot;. The Yonhap News Agency also quoted a source suggesting a forest fire.
* A natural cumulonimbus cloud formation.

If there was an explosion, the main possible causes:
* Explosive remnants of war. Unexploded ordnance from the Korean War become increasingly unstable as they deteriorate. The United States dropped 635,000 tons of bombs in Korea between 1950 and 1953.
* North Korea&#x27;s official explanation of controlled demolition for a hydroelectric project.
* A nuclear weapon test or demonstration. Recent intelligence reported that North Korea might have been planning its first nuclear bomb test, and the significant date lends credence to this hypothesis. However, it would be unusual for North Korea to then deny it, and international officials have stated that it does not appear to have been a nuclear explosion. (Later updates in intelligence suggested that the test planning may have not been what it appeared to be.)
* A nuclear accident. Likewise, it has been denied that the explosion was nuclear.
* A large chemical explosive blast, to calibrate for a later nuclear test.
* Explosion of a munitions dump, or of explosives in a munitions factory.

Finally, another way to divide up explosion hypotheses is by how intentional it was:
* Intended by North Korea.
* Accidental. North Korea&#x27;s failing economy has made its industry accident-prone, as seen in the Ryongchon disaster earlier in 2004.
* Covert operation by a foreign state.
* Military or terrorist action connected with an internal power struggle.

North Korea&#x27;s claim to possess nuclear weapons on 10 February 2005 gives the nuclear testing or accident hypotheses some credibility. However, no neighboring nations have claimed any detection of radioactive isotopes which would be characteristic of either. North Korea claimed to have tested its first nuclear weapon on 9 October 2006. There have since been multiple nuclear tests by North Korea.

<doc id="979212" wikidata="Q1328052" url="?curid=979212" title="Jamaica Inn">
<text>The Jamaica Inn is a traditional inn on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, England, which was built as a coaching inn in 1750, and has a historical association with smuggling. Located just off the A30, near the middle of the moor close to the hamlet of Bolventor, it was originally used as a staging post for changing horses. The &quot;Tuber&quot; or &quot;Two Barrows&quot; hill, is close by.

The inn was the setting for Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, about the nocturnal activities of a smuggling ring, &quot;portraying a hidden world as a place of tense excitement and claustrophobia of real peril and thrill.&quot; In the novel, it was transformed into a rendezvous and warehouse for smuggling that was solely the home of the landlord and his wife. The novel has been adapted into various media, most famously an eponymous 1939 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. However, the inn itself has never actually been used as a filming location.

The inn is also referenced in &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, a song by Tori Amos from her album &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; (2005), written while she was driving along the cliffs in Cornwall, and inspired by the legend she had heard of the inn.

==Location==
Jamaica Inn is on Bodmin Moor, near Bolventor. Brown Willy is situated to the north, while Rough Tor is nearby, as are the valleys of Hantergantick and Hannon. Dozmary Pool is situated south of the inn, while a branch of the river Fowey is west. Spread over of land, the Jamaica Inn has been refurbished and functions as an exclusive bed and breakfast establishment, with a pub, a museum and a gift shop. Bodmin is connected by road with St Austell railway station, which is on the London-Penzance Cornish Main Line. The farm where British astronomer John Couch Adams was born is nearby. Other landmarks include the Four-hole Cross, Peverell&#x27;s Cross, the circular entrenchment near Cardinham, and the Knights Templar church ruins at Temple. Between the inn and Kilmarth, a house near Par, can be found hut circles, stone lines and parts of ancient stream works.

==History==
Though an inn has stood on the main road (modern A30, before the bypass was built) through the hamlet since 1547, the current building dates from 1750. It was extended in 1778 with a coach house, stables and a tack room assembled in an L-shaped fashion. It is often commonly thought that the inn takes its name from the smugglers who smuggled rum into the country from Jamaica and stored it at the inn. However, the name of the inn is actually said to derive from the important local Trelawney family of landowners, of which two family members served as Governors of Jamaica in the 18th century.

Cornwall has been very aptly described as the &quot;haven of smugglers&quot; in view of its topographic features of &quot;rocky coves, sheltered bays, tumultuous waves and wild and untenanted landscapes&quot;.
The inn became a smugglers&#x27; stopping point while they used approximately 100 secret routes to move around their contraband.

According to narrated story, gangs of wreckers operated on the coast of Cornwall during early 19th century. The wreckers ensnared ships to this coast line by tricking them with use of lights which they purposefully installed on the shores of the coast. Once the ships foundered on the rocky coast they were looted by the wreckers. While such endeavours have been depicted in many stories and legends, there is no clear evidence that this has ever happened.

By 1847, Francis Rodd of Trebartha Hall, who had been High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1845, was building a chapel at Bolventor to accommodate those who lived in the Jamaica Inn area. A 1856 guide book by Thomas Clifton Paris states that the same Francis Rodd had erected a church, parsonage, and school near the hitherto solitary halfway house to the satisfaction of the area&#x27;s residents, and that the inn was frequented by sportsmen in the winter and afforded comfortable, though somewhat rude, accommodation.

The current building still includes the extension of a coach house, stables and a tack room added in 1778. The inn was owned for a period by the novelist Alistair MacLean and it has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since 23 November 1988.

In March 2022, the inn announced that fox hunts, including the East Cornwall Hunt and the Beaufort Hunt, were banned from its premises, with Allen Jackson, the inn&#x27;s owner, saying, &quot;We have always lost money because some people won’t come here because of the association with hunts. There are no pluses, all we get is minuses. They never spent any money here – they never came in.&quot;

In August 2022, the hotel was acquired by The Coaching Inn Group, a national operator of distinctive coaching inns and destination venues. 

==Architecture and fittings==
The two-storey building, constructed in the mid-18th century, had symmetrical front windows that were replaced in the 20th century. The slate roof is bitumen-coated and has hipped ends. An extension with two additional rooms was built in the 19th and 20th centuries. The central door and gabled porch are flanked by two light casements; all are attributed to the 20th century. The building&#x27;s exterior is made of dark slate and stone. It has a cobbled courtyard which features an old rusty anchor and a red telephone box. Historically, however, the courtyard was gravel. The exterior to the Smuggler&#x27;s Bar says, &quot;Through these portals passed smugglers, wreckers, villains and murderers, but rest easy... &#x27;twas many years ago&quot;.

The interior is characterised by sloping floors with many of its original beams. Internal building partitions have been removed. The fireplaces display roughly cut granite lintels. The Smuggler&#x27;s Bar in particular retains its 18th-century feel with its large granite fireplace in the bar and dark wood beams. The bar area contains many old bank notes on the walls and various items such as brass or copper kettles and urns.

==Museums==
===Mr Potter&#x27;s Museum of Curiosities===

Between 1984 and 2003, the building housed a large collection of stuffed animals in complex dioramas, such as an animal courthouse or school classroom populated by baby squirrels. Known as &quot;Mr Potter&#x27;s Museum of Curiosities&quot;, these exhibits were created by Walter Potter in the 1850s, and were originally housed in his museum in Bramber, Sussex. The collection was auctioned by Bonhams in 2003 resulting in its dispersal.

===Museum of Smuggling===
The inn now contains &quot;The Museum of Smuggling&quot;, which is located to the western side of the inn and the main coaching house. A plaque on the walls outside says &quot;The Museum of Smuggling. Presents a record of classical examples in the arts of concealment and evasion&quot;. The museum&#x27;s main focus is its collection of smuggling artefacts that is depicted through the history of the Jamaica Inn and the inn&#x27;s role in this trade for many years. The Cornish coast was the most popular location for smuggling of silks, tea, tobacco and brandy into England and operated from locations such as Polperro on the south coast and Boscastle, Trebarwith and Tintagel on the north coast as this coastline was not well covered by the law enforcing authorities. Many of the smugglers stored their contraband in the isolated location of the Jamaica Inn. It is also said that even the judges were fairly lenient towards the smugglers, probably due to their receiving some of the smuggled goods.
The museum contains various items including &quot;Wanted&quot; posters, one of which is dated to 1798, a poster celebrating Lord Nelson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, various pottery figures of smugglers and villains, a bag of &quot;10 pounds of Jamaican ganja&quot; and old books etc. There is also a display of various items owned by Daphne du Maurier, including her writing desk and typewriter, in the room where she stayed in 1930.

<text>This article details some of the history of lead mining in Derbyshire, England.

== Background ==

Lutudarum (believed to have been at either Wirksworth or nearby Carsington) was the administrative centre of the Roman lead mining industry in Britain. Numerous lead ingots have been found in Derbyshire, in Sussex and around Hull with LVT, LVTVM or LVTVDARVM marked on them.

It has been claimed that Odin Mine, near Castleton, one of the oldest lead mines in England, may have been worked in the tenth century or even as early as Roman Britain, but it was certainly productive in the 1200s. Derbyshire lead mines are mentioned in the Pipe Rolls. Recent analysis of a Swiss ice-core extracted in 2013 indicates that levels of lead in atmospheric pollution between 1170 and 1216 were as high as those during the Industrial Revolution and correlate accurately with lead production from Peak District mines, the main European source at the time. On one of the walls in Wirksworth Church is a crude stone carving, found nearby at Bonsall and placed in the church in the 1870s. Probably executed in Anglo-Saxon times, it shows a man carrying a kibble or basket in one hand and a pick in the other. He is a lead miner. The north choir aisle of Wirksworth church is dominated by a far more ostentatious monument, a large ornate alabaster chest tomb, a memorial to Ralph Gell of Hopton, who died in 1563. The simple figure of the miner bears witness to the fact that for centuries the people of Wirksworth and their neighbours relied on lead mining. Ralph Gell&#x27;s imposing tomb is evidence that a few people became rich and powerful from the trade.

While Derbyshire lead made Gell and others rich, for poor families it was both a living and an adventure, with the possibility of a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them. Mining was hard and dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, methane gas in shale workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries. From the later years of the 17th century gunpowder introduced a further hazard. Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the limestone landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to King Charles I &quot;many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting great quantities of lead for the use of the Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...&quot;.

By the 17th century lead was second in importance in the national economy only to wool. It was essential for the roofs of public buildings and the new houses being built in every part of the country by the nobility and gentry. All houses, including farmhouses and cottages by then, had glazed windows, with lead glazing bars. It was the only material for water storage and piping. Every army used it as ammunition. There was a thriving export trade as well as the home market and the Wirksworth area was the main source of the ore.

Wirksworth was the administrative centre of one of the &quot;hundreds&quot;, local government units, of Derbyshire. Uniquely, the Wirksworth Hundred was still known by the archaic term &quot;Wapentake&quot;. Lead ore was Crown property in most places and the mining area of Derbyshire under royal control was known as the King&#x27;s Field, with two separately administered divisions, the High and Low Peaks, each further divided into &quot;liberties&quot;, based on parishes. Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low Peak area of the King&#x27;s Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, Middleton-by-Wirksworth, Cromford, Brassington, Matlock, Elton, Middleton-by-Youlgreave, Bonsall, Hopton and Carsington, and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang, on Cromford Moor which had become extremely productive after being drained by the first of the Derbyshire drainage schemes, or &quot;soughs&quot;.

There had always been lead mining in and around Wirksworth. This is limestone country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of galena: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed &quot;pigs&quot;, or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence. In the 9th century Repton Abbey owned mines at Wirksworth and when the abbey was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king Ceolwulf. They remained in royal hands after the Norman conquest of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and smelting was an established industry in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and Bakewell were recorded in the Domesday Book.

==Mining methods==
Lead had traditionally been found by following veins from surface outcroppings, particularly in &quot;rakes&quot; or vertical fissures. By the 17th century, however, most surface lead had been mined and prospecting was achieved by less direct methods. Miners searched for surface signs that were similar to known lead-rich areas, they checked ploughed and other disturbed land for traces of ore, and they checked for signs in plants and trees and poorly performing crops, since lead is poisonous to most living things. They used probes to check for signs of ore in soil a few feet under the surface and dug exploratory holes or trenches in promising places. This was usually done to choose the best places to sink shafts ahead of existing working and the rules defined when and where these activities could be carried out.

The miners sank their shafts in &quot;turns&quot; of up to , each turn being a few yards away from the bottom of the preceding one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or &quot;stemples&quot;, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day&#x27;s work. These &quot;climbing shafts&quot; were usually within the miners&#x27; &quot;coe&quot;, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an &quot;adit&quot; or tunnel driven into the slope.

Ore was brought to the surface up a &quot;winding shaft&quot; outside the coe. The miners&#x27; equipment included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, &quot;wiskets&quot; or baskets to contain it, &quot;corves&quot; or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or &quot;stows&quot;, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway can be found in the Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day&#x27;s work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.

==16th-century technical change==

After a mid-16th-century slump the industry recovered, new mines were opened on Middleton Moor, and production increased, a recovery mainly due to technical developments. While traditional extraction methods had persisted there were vital changes in the ways in which ore was prepared for smelting and in the smelting process itself.

===Bole smelting===

The traditional smelter was a &quot;bole&quot;, a large fire built on a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as &quot;bing&quot; and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.

===Smelting mills===

In the late 16th century wind power was abandoned and the smelting blast was provided by a bellows driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by &quot;white coal&quot;, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to charcoal for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which would have made it difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. Draught for the furnaces came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.

===Dressing===

Before a miner could sell his ore he had to dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock in which it was embedded and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a &quot;bucker&quot; or, in larger mines, on a &quot;crushing circle&quot;, where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a &quot;buddle&quot; or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.
==Mining customs==

Everything about the old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole structure was designed to enable the Duchy of Lancaster, a royal possession, to collect the king&#x27;s royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king&#x27;s farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners&#x27; juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Moot Hall in Wirksworth.

It was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called &quot;free mining&quot;. Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant amount of ore was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to it as long as he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster&#x27;s tenants at Brassington complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle. In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1 shilling, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them. But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.

===King&#x27;s farmers and chief barmasters===

The coveted and valuable farm of the Duchy of Lancaster&#x27;s right to the lead mine duties, coupled as it was with the office of chief barmaster, endowed its owner with both a considerable income and authority over the running of the industry. It was always resold at a much higher price than that charged by the Duchy, which was £110 plus annual payments of £72 for the duties and £1-6-8d for the barmastership.

===Chief barmasters and the 24===

At dinner in Wirksworth after meetings of the 17th-century Barmote Court, the landlord of the inn had three tables for those attending the Court. There was the &quot;24 table&quot;, where the members of the 24-man jury sat, and where he charged 8d per head, &quot;the barmasters&#x27; table&quot;, at 10d a head, and a table where &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s dinners&quot; cost 1 shilling each. The gentlemen drank sack or claret with their dinner; the men were served with beer. The bill was paid by the king&#x27;s farmer and chief barmaster. There were usually about a dozen gentlemen, some of whom were members of the jury, while others were there to present a case to the Court. Also among the gentlemen were the steward of the court, who was a lawyer and who conducted the sessions. When the chief barmaster for the Wapentake, always a man of wealth and rank, was a local gentleman such as Sir John Gell of Hopton or his son John, the 2nd baronet, he often attended the Court himself. If the current chief barmaster was an absentee member of the gentry or nobility he relied on his deputy barmasters.

In addition to helping the barmasters to carry out their duties the 24 jurors brought practical experience to bear when the Barmote Court was adjudicating in disputes and trials. The main requirement of the jurymen was that they should be knowledgeable in mining matters and they included both working miners and, when it was thought necessary, local gentry.

===Deputy barmasters===

The deputy barmasters whom the chief barmaster appointed were experienced local men. Some of them were yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen. The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much of the business of the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required them to be able to read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it was measured by the dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as &quot;lot&quot;. This was the barmaster&#x27;s &quot;reckoning&quot;. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called &quot;cope&quot;.

===Giving a mine===

The barmaster or his deputy granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was &quot;grove&quot; or &quot;groove&quot;, on receipt of proof that it was viable. The proof was a standard container, a dish, filled with about of ore from the mine in question. Every dish was calibrated by the barmaster twice a year against a brass standard dish. The miner thus granted title to the mine was said to have &quot;freed&quot; it, either &quot;for old&quot; if a development in an existing mine, or &quot;for new&quot; in the case of a new discovery. He was given permission to work 2 &quot;meers&quot; of ground, known as &quot;founder meers&quot;, with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king&#x27;s, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, &quot;taker meers&quot;, along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his &quot;possessions&quot; or &quot;stows&quot; (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to &quot;wind&quot; the ore from the shaft). A meer was , in the Wirksworth Wapentake.

Since the course of a vein of lead was unpredictable, there were many disputes caused by one group of miners following a vein into another mine. There were occasions when possession was disputed by physical means.

===Title-holding and record keeping===

The deputy barmasters were responsible for settling disputes over ownership or of &quot;arresting&quot; or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left unworked. They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to &quot;nick&quot; the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: &quot;Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte.&quot;

The deputy barmasters kept records of all changes of title and of the amounts of ore measured and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular &quot;reckonings&quot; at the mines. The lot and cope &quot;accounts&quot; involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, the name of the miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the amount of ore mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the amount of ore sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope. Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives &quot;to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning&quot;. Many of their records have survived.

===Accidents===

In conjunction with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner in the case of fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in Throstle Nest mine.

Wirksworth Wapentake March 26th 1761.
We, whose names are under written, being this day summoned by Mr. Edward Ashton, Bar-Master for the Liberty of Brassington, to a groove called by the name of Throstle Nest on Brassington Pasture; to enquire into the cause of the death of T.W. now lying before us; accordingly we have been down the shaft to the Foot thereof, and down one sump or turn to the foot thereof, and on a gate North-wardly about sixteen yards to the Forefield, where the deceased had been at work; and by the information of William Briddon who was working near him; it appears that a large stone fell upon him out of the roof, and it is our opinions the said stone was the cause of his death.
===Structure of industry===

The free mining arrangement under the rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy&#x27;s lessee of the mineral rights at the end of the 16th century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land. Shrewsbury&#x27;s success embedded the old rules and facilitated free mining.

There was one independent area within the Wapentake, Griffe Grange, near Brassington, held by the Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII. The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them. Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at Elton, where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him &quot;to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton&quot;. This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.

For historical reasons the structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy&#x27;s authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues. The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.

The operation of the old rules and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent the development of a complicated structure there. The barmasters&#x27; ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters&#x27; accounts for 1653 show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden&#x27;s Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called &quot;cavers&quot;.

==Pollution==

Lead is poisonous to both plants and animals. For people the smelting processes are the most dangerous – the restored smelter at Spitewinter, near Chesterfield, stands a few yards from Belland Lane, &quot;belland&quot; being lead poisoning. The current owners of the smelter on the site of the former Mill Close mine at Darley Bridge have bought much of the adjoining land and turned arable and pasture into woodland, to avoid the danger to crops and animals.

The danger to plants and animals, particularly from washing or &quot;buddling&quot;, has been known for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. &quot;For buddling ... I have heard that miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them.&quot;

In 1794 several groups of Wensley miners who had buddled mine waste in the river Derwent above and below Darley Bridge were brought to court, accused of polluting the river. Witnesses described the river as being muddied as far down-river as a mile below Cromford Bridge, and a Matlock publican claimed to have been prevented from his usual practice of using river water for his brewing by the state of the Derwent. He had had to sink a well to stay in business. Mining law was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into &quot;some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)&quot; to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine – their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent – lost their case.

In addition to the mining law to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations – there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas as well as the recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills had chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows. Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.

==Mine drainage==

Until the 17th century mining had usually been abandoned when the work reached the water table. Efforts at draining lead mines by horse-powered pumps, or &quot;engines&quot;, had little success. In the later years of the industry mines were successfully drained by hydraulic, steam, internal combustion and electric power, but the first successes were achieved by soughs, drainage tunnels driven into flooded veins to allow the water to run off. Dr Rieuwerts has provided a comprehensive gazetteer of the Derbyshire lead mining soughs. By lowering the water table and opening up large new deposits of lead ore, they transformed the industry.

The first sough, designed by Sir Cornelius Vermuyden, knighted for his work in draining the East Anglian fens, was driven over a twenty-year period from a point on Cromford Hill, between Cromford and Wirksworth, into an area called the Dovegang. When it was completed in 1652 there was an immediate jump in ore production in the area. Vermuyden&#x27;s was followed by a succession of soughs which by the end of the century had drained enough of the mines in the Wirksworth Wapentake to cause a dramatic rise in production in the whole area. The most important were the Cromford Sough, which was over thirty years in driving, between 1662 and 1696, and was continued in the 18th century, and Hannage Sough, begun in 1693 and also continued into the next century. The Cromford Sough provided the power for Richard Arkwright&#x27;s mills at Cromford, the first of which was built in 1771. Also among the important 17th century soughs were the Raventor, begun in 1655, Bates (1657–84), Lees (1664), and Baileycroft (1667–73). The Baileycroft Sough drained mines in Wirksworth. Those in the area just to the north of Wirksworth called the Gulf were drained by the Raventor and Lees Soughs. The Bates and Cromford Soughs drained mines on Cromford Moor – Bates Sough had reached the Dovegang by 1684. Hannage Sough drained the area to the east of Yokecliffe Rake, on the south of Wirksworth.

Drainage of the mines in the whole of the Wirksworth area was eventually accomplished by the Meerbrook Sough, begun at the level of the river Derwent in 1772, at a time when lead-mining ventures had become only intermittently profitable. The entrance to this sough is wide and high and has a keystone inscribed &quot;FH 1772&quot;. FH was Francis Hurt of Alderwasley, smelter, lead mine shareholder, iron-master and the main shareholder in the sough. It still discharges to a day, and by the 1830s had so reduced the flow from the Cromford Sough that in 1846 Richard Arkwright&#x27;s successor had to end production at the Cromford mills.
In other areas the Mill Close mines between Winster and Wensley, and the mines of Youlgreave were soughed.

==Cupola smelting ==

The mills which had superseded the ancient bolehills in the late 16th century, a development described above, were themselves superseded in the 18th century by the gradual introduction of a new type of furnace known as the cupola.

The old mills had a number of disadvantages. Their characteristic overheating and dissemination of polluting fumes made it necessary to close the smelter down at the end of each day&#x27;s work. The hearth burned out quickly and regular weekly repairs or rebuilding were necessary – between 24 June and 29 September 1657, for instance, thirteen new hearths were required at the Upper Mill in Wirksworth. Water-powered smelting mills were restricted to riverside sites and &quot;white coal&quot; fuel required a good supply of timber. By the 18th century timber supplies were running out and, where coke or coal was used because of timber shortages, impurities, particularly sulphur, were introduced into the lead. It was, finally, less efficient than the cupola.

The cupola was a reverberatory furnace. The fuel was burned in a combustion chamber at the side of the furnace, separate from the &quot;charge&quot; of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.

Several factors contributed to the cupola&#x27;s greater efficiency than the smelting mill. Unlike the smelting mill, the cupola could be operated continuously. Since the air flow over the ore was less powerful than that from the bellows of the blast furnace fewer lead particles were blown away. Further lead was saved by the fact that since the fuel and the charge were separate none of the lead was lost into the ash. Since no water power was needed the cupola had a fourth theoretical advantage of being freed from the riverside location of the blast furnace, and able to be placed in the most convenient site for supply of ore and coal. However, the higher temperatures needed to melt the slag recovered from the primary melt required a water-powered furnace and, since slag mills tended to be placed next to the cupolas, most cupolas remained in riverside sites.

Many cupolas had long horizontal flues, which were introduced to trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of the flue could also be recovered for resmelting.

==Closure==

The Derbyshire lead industry declined after the late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production costs and the discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by import duty in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845 brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry&#x27;s decline.

There were still bursts of high production, and indeed the output of certain mines during the 18th and 19th centuries exceeded anything achieved in the 17th century; over 2658 loads (about 641 tons or 651 metric tonnes) were mined at Brassington, traditionally an area of low output, in 1862. At a meeting of the Barmote Court in Wirksworth in 1862 one mine owner announced &quot;that by perseverance for upwards of twenty years, they had at last found the long sought for treasure, which he hoped would be prosperous, and they should be able to continue employing, as they are at the present time, upwards of 100 men at one mine in Brassington&quot;. However, by 1901 the number of men employed in all the Derbyshire lead mines had fallen to 285 most of whom worked at the Mill Close Mine at Darley Bridge. Mill Close, the biggest lead mine in the country, took the Derbyshire lead industry into the 20th century, and just before its enforced closure in 1939, caused by flooding, employed about 600 men. The smelter at Mill Close, established in 1934, was bought in 1941 by H J Enthoven and Sons, a London-based lead producer, and still operates.

<text>Joseph Anthony Hernandez (born July 2, 1969), professionally known as Tony Touch, is an American hip hop break dancer, rapper, record producer and DJ of Puerto Rican descent.

==Career==
Tony Touch began as a B-boy during the rap music renaissance era of the early 1980s. Heavily influenced by pioneers like Crazy Legs and the Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, Red Alert, Little Louie Vega and Jam Master Jay, he quickly shifted his interests towards the turntables. Tony is known for his mixtapes the 50 MC&#x27;s. His mixtapes have featured guest appearances from Boot Camp Clik, Eminem, KRS-One, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Wyclef Jean, M.O.P., Big L, and Mos Def.

In 2000, Tony released his debut album &quot;The Piece Maker&quot; on Tommy Boy Records. It sold 400,000 units worldwide and featured guest appearances from Big Pun, Cypress Hill, Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Eminem, and Gang Starr.

In 2000 the single &quot;I Wonder Why&quot; featuring Total was released. The music video featured cameos from John Leguizamo, Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, The Awesome 2, Marley Marl, and DJ Premier.

Since then, Tony Touch has released &quot;The Piece Maker 2&quot;, which featured guest appearances from Puff Daddy, Fat Joe, Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, and Ruben Blades.

Tony Touch is also known to represent the urban Latino community with his Spanglish lyrics and Salsa roots. This is the result of him growing up with salsa at home and hip-hop influence in his lifestyle.

In 2005 Tony signed to EMI records releasing a reggaeton album, &quot;ReggaeTony&quot;. The lead single &quot;Play That Song&quot; featured Nina Sky and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The CD included collaborations with artists such as Tego Calderon, Zion and Lenox, Pitbull, Ivy Queen, NORE, Voltio, Mexicano, Thirston Howl III, and Soni. The album went gold, and EMI moved quickly to release &quot;ReggaeTony 2&quot;. This CD featured Lumidee, Plan B, Joell Ortiz, Tru Life, Don Chezina, and the Beatnuts. To this date Tony has sold over a million records worldwide.

On July 16, 2013, his sixth album &quot;The Piece Maker 3: Return of the 50 MC&#x27;s&quot; was released and featured guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, Reek da Villain, Roc Marciano, Lil&#x27; Fame, Too Short, Xzibit, Kurupt, B-Real, Papoose, Uncle Murda, Black Thought, Styles P, Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, RZA, Eminem, Twista, Bun B, Action Bronson, Prodigy, Joell Ortiz, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;, KRS-One, Crooked I, Redman, Method Man, N.O.R.E., and Erick Sermon.

In 2016 he paired up with Austin Brown to collaborate as CaliYork. They released the single &quot;Show Up At My Place&quot; in September.

<text>Jonathan M. Finn (born 1958) is an American rock musician and guitarist. He is the founder and leader of the Jon Finn Group, and is a professor at the Berklee College of Music; he joined the guitar faculty there in 1988. He is also the author of several books on the guitar, and was an instructional columnist for &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine for three years.

Finn grew up in Westwood, Massachusetts, and began playing guitar at the age of six. He later became a student at Berklee. When he was 14 years old he played with the group Cheap Thrills, which consisted of Finn, Steve Carro (Vocals), Bob Shain (Keyboard), Ron Dupres (Bass), Joel Sklar (Rhythm Guitar), and Greg Buckingham (Drums).

He has been a guest performer with the Boston Pops, recording several albums with them, including the Grammy-nominated &quot;The Celtic Album&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Latin Album&quot; (1999). He has also performed with John Petrucci of Dream Theater, Carl Verheyen, Vinnie Moore, Andy Timmons, Steve Morse of the Dixie Dregs, New York Voices, Collin Raye, Dweezil Zappa, and Debbie Reynolds, among others. In addition he has toured with musical theater productions such as &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and &quot;Copacabana&quot;. In his 1999 publication, &quot;Advanced Modern Rock Guitar Improvisation&quot;, Finn introduced the warp refraction principle.

In 1997, Finn was listed as #30 in the &quot;Westwood One Hundred&quot; publication&#x27;s List of Top 100 notable people and places in Westwood.

Warp refraction is a term coined by Finn in his 1999 publication, Advanced Modern Rock Guitar Improvisation, to describe the single major third string interval in standard guitar tuning.

<doc id="979222" wikidata="Q706504" url="?curid=979222" title="Amarillo Slim">
<text>Thomas Austin Preston Jr. (December 31, 1928 – April 29, 2012), known as Amarillo Slim, was an American professional gambler known for his poker skills and proposition bets. He won the 1972 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event and was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Poker career==
Before becoming a well-known tournament player, Preston was a rounder, touring the United States looking for gambling action along with Doyle Brunson and Sailor Roberts, effectively introducing Texas hold &#x27;em, the most popular poker type today, to Las Vegas in the 1960s.

Preston participated in the first World Series of Poker in 1970 along with Johnny Moss, Sailor Roberts, Doyle Brunson, Puggy Pearson, Crandell Addington, and Carl Cannon. Following his victory in the 1972 WSOP Main Event, he appeared on several talk shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and had a small part in the 1974 Robert Altman movie &quot;California Split&quot;. He appeared on the panel game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, where his secret involved losing $190,000 in one night of poker.

He also founded the tournament series called Amarillo Slim&#x27;s Super Bowl of Poker, which ran annually between 1979 and 1991.

Preston won four WSOP bracelets, including two in Omaha. Preston&#x27;s final WSOP win was in 1990. In the $2,500 Pot Limit Omaha event at the 2000 WSOP, he came in second to Phil Ivey.

In January/February 1980, Amarillo Slim hosted the Second Annual Poker Classic, which was the second-most prestigious poker tournament of its time. This series eventually came to be called the Super Bowl of Poker and continued until 1991. Gabe Kaplan became the first winner of this tournament series and Stu Ungar won the title three times.

The video game &quot;Amarillo Slim Dealer&#x27;s Choice&quot; was published by Villa Crespo Software in 1991.

Preston&#x27;s lifetime tournament earnings totaled more than $587,000.

=== World Series of Poker bracelets ===
===Author===
In 1973, Preston and Bill G. Cox wrote &quot;Play Poker to Win&quot;, which was published by Grosset and Dunlap. A revised edition of the book was published by HarperCollins in 2005 entitled &quot;Amarillo Slim&#x27;s Play Poker to Win&quot;.

In May 2003, Preston published his autobiography &quot;Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People&quot;, where he wrote of playing poker with Larry Flynt, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon among others. In addition to his poker exploits, Preston wrote about his exploits in proposition betting.

In April 2007, Preston created a website and released an E-book called &quot;All In: An E-guide To No Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em&quot;. The book was written by Preston along with Joe Brent Riley.

==Personal life==
Thomas Austin Preston Jr. was born on December 31, 1928, in Johnson, Arkansas. When he was an infant his parents moved to Turkey, Texas. After they divorced, his mother returned to Johnson, while his father moved to Amarillo. Slim is quoted as saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing he did, because Amarillo Slim sounds a heck of a lot better than Turkey Tom or Arkansas Austin.&quot; Preston was divorced, had three children, and lived in Amarillo, Texas.

Beyond being known as a great poker player, Preston was also known for playing pool, dominoes, and proposition betting. Notably, Slim had beaten Willie Nelson and Larry King at dominoes.

In August 2003, Preston was indicted in Randall County, Texas, on charges of indecency with a 12-year-old grandchild. The charges were reduced to misdemeanor assault in a plea bargain, and on February 10, 2004, Preston pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; to the reduced charges &quot;to protect his family&quot;. Preston received a $4,000 fine, two years probation, and was &quot;ordered to undergo counseling&quot;. In a 2009 interview, he stated that he was innocent of any wrongdoing, but chose to take the plea bargain in order to spare his family from a court trial.

Early on the morning of October 4, 2006, Preston was the victim of an attempted armed robbery. The armed robber fired three bullets into Preston&#x27;s car as he sped away. Preston was not injured.

On January 28, 2007, Preston was robbed at gunpoint while in his home.

On January 22, 2009, Preston was beaten and robbed near the intersection of Interstate 40 and Soncy Road while attempting to collect a gambling debt.

Preston&#x27;s autobiography was the topic of a biopic movie reported to be under development. Nicolas Cage reportedly was to play Preston&#x27;s character. According to a 2009 article at Poker Listings, the &quot;planned Hollywood movie about Slim&#x27;s life&quot; has been &quot;dropped&quot;.

Preston died on April 29, 2012, of colon cancer at the age of 83.

<doc id="979227" wikidata="Q3060" url="?curid=979227" title="Rings of Jupiter">
<text>The rings of Jupiter are a system of faint planetary rings. The Jovian rings were the third ring system to be discovered in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus. The main ring was discovered in 1979 by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe and the system was more thoroughly investigated in the 1990s by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter. The main ring has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Earth for several years. Ground-based observation of the rings requires the largest available telescopes.

The Jovian ring system is faint and consists mainly of dust. It has four main components: a thick inner torus of particles known as the &quot;halo ring&quot;; a relatively bright, exceptionally thin &quot;main ring&quot;; and two wide, thick and faint outer &quot; rings&quot;, named for the moons of whose material they are composed: Amalthea and Thebe.

The main and halo rings consist of dust ejected from the moons Metis, Adrastea and perhaps smaller, unobserved bodies as the result of high-velocity impacts. High-resolution images obtained in February and March 2007 by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.

In visible and near-infrared light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The size of the dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly constrained, but is probably in the range of 1011 to 1016 kg. The age of the ring system is also not known, but it is possible that it has existed since the formation of Jupiter.

A ring or ring arc appears to exist close to the moon Himalia&#x27;s orbit. One explanation is that a small moon recently crashed into Himalia and the force of the impact ejected the material that forms the ring.

==Discovery and structure==
Jupiter&#x27;s ring system was the third to be discovered in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus. It was first observed on 4 March 1979 by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; space probe. It is composed of four main components: a thick inner torus of particles known as the &quot;halo ring&quot;; a relatively bright, exceptionally thin &quot;main ring&quot;; and two wide, thick and faint outer &quot;gossamer rings&quot;, named after the moons of whose material they are composed: Amalthea and Thebe. The principal attributes of the known Jovian Rings are listed in the table.

In 2022, dynamical simulations suggested that the relative meagreness of Jupiter&#x27;s ring system, compared to that of the smaller Saturn, is due to destabilising resonances created by the Galilean satellites.
==Main ring==

===Appearance and structure===


The narrow and relatively thin main ring is the brightest part of Jupiter&#x27;s ring system. Its outer edge is located at a radius of about (; = equatorial radius of Jupiter or ) and coincides with the orbit of Jupiter&#x27;s smallest inner satellite, Adrastea. Its inner edge is not marked by any satellite and is located at about ().

Thus the width of the main ring is around . The appearance of the main ring depends on the viewing geometry. In forward-scattered light the brightness of the main ring begins to decrease steeply at (just inward of the Adrastean orbit) and reaches the background level at —just outward of the Adrastean orbit. Therefore, Adrastea at clearly shepherds the ring. The brightness continues to increase in the direction of Jupiter and has a maximum near the ring&#x27;s center at , although there is a pronounced gap (notch) near the Metidian orbit at . The inner boundary of the main ring, in contrast, appears to fade off slowly from to , merging into the halo ring. In forward-scattered light all Jovian rings are especially bright.

In back-scattered light the situation is different. The outer boundary of the main ring, located at , or slightly beyond the orbit of Adrastea, is very steep. The orbit of the moon is marked by a gap in the ring so there is a thin ringlet just outside its orbit. There is another ringlet just inside Adrastean orbit followed by a gap of unknown origin located at about . The third ringlet is found inward of the central gap, outside the orbit of Metis. The ring&#x27;s brightness drops sharply just outward of the Metidian orbit, forming the Metis notch. Inward of the orbit of Metis, the brightness of the ring rises much less than in forward-scattered light. So in the back-scattered geometry the main ring appears to consist of two different parts: a narrow outer part extending from to , which itself includes three narrow ringlets separated by notches, and a fainter inner part from to , which lacks any visible structure like in the forward-scattering geometry. The Metis notch serves as their boundary. The fine structure of the main ring was discovered in data from the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter and is clearly visible in back-scattered images obtained from &quot;New Horizons&quot; in February–March 2007. The early observations by Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Keck and the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft failed to detect it, probably due to insufficient spatial resolution. However the fine structure was observed by the Keck telescope using adaptive optics in 2002–2003.

Observed in back-scattered light the main ring appears to be razor thin, extending in the vertical direction no more than 30 km. In the side scatter geometry the ring thickness is 80–160 km, increasing somewhat in the direction of Jupiter. The ring appears to be much thicker in the forward-scattered light—about 300 km. One of the discoveries of the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter was the bloom of the main ring—a faint, relatively thick (about 600 km) cloud of material which surrounds its inner part. The bloom grows in thickness towards the inner boundary of the main ring, where it transitions into the halo.

Detailed analysis of the &quot;Galileo&quot; images revealed longitudinal variations of the main ring&#x27;s brightness unconnected with the viewing geometry. The Galileo images also showed some patchiness in the ring on the scales 500–1000 km.

In February–March 2007 &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft conducted a deep search for new small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5 km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small clumps of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to –. The clumps are divided into two groups of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.

===Spectra and particle size distribution===
Spectra of the main ring obtained by the HST, Keck, Galileo and &quot;Cassini&quot; have shown that particles forming it are red, i.e. their albedo is higher at longer wavelengths. The existing spectra span the range 0.5–2.5 μm. No spectral features have been found so far which can be attributed to particular chemical compounds, although the Cassini observations yielded evidence for absorption bands near 0.8 μm and 2.2 μm. The spectra of the main ring are very similar to Adrastea and Amalthea.

The properties of the main ring can be explained by the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10 μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering. However, larger bodies are required to explain the strong back-scattering and fine structure in the bright outer part of the main ring.

Analysis of available phase and spectral data leads to a conclusion that the size distribution of small particles in the main ring obeys a power law

:formula_1

where &quot;n&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) &quot;dr&quot; is a number of particles with radii between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;r&quot; + &quot;dr&quot; and formula_2 is a normalizing parameter chosen to match the known total light flux from the ring. The parameter &quot;q&quot; is 2.0 ± 0.2 for particles with &quot;r&quot; &lt; 15 ± 0.3 μm and &quot;q&quot; = 5 ± 1 for those with &quot;r&quot; &gt; 15 ± 0.3 μm. The distribution of large bodies in the mm–km size range is undetermined presently. The light scattering in this model is dominated by particles with &quot;r&quot; around 15 μm.

The power law mentioned above allows estimation of the optical depth formula_3 of the main ring: formula_4 for the large bodies and formula_5 for the dust. This optical depth means that the total cross section of all particles inside the ring is about 5000 km². The particles in the main ring are expected to have aspherical shapes. The total mass of the dust is estimated to be 107−109 kg. The mass of large bodies, excluding Metis and Adrastea, is 1011−1016 kg. It depends on their maximum size— the upper value corresponds to about 1 km maximum diameter. These masses can be compared with masses of Adrastea, which is about 2 kg, Amalthea, about 2 kg, and Earth&#x27;s Moon, 7.4 kg.

The presence of two populations of particles in the main ring explains why its appearance depends on the viewing geometry. The dust scatters light preferably in the forward direction and forms a relatively thick homogenous ring bounded by the orbit of Adrastea. In contrast, large particles, which scatter in the back direction, are confined in a number of ringlets between the Metidian and Adrastean orbits.

===Origin and age===

The dust is constantly being removed from the main ring by a combination of Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials such as ices, for example, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to , so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1 cm to 0.5 km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about —and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5 km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and &quot;Cassini&quot; observations, was near 4 km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.

===Vertical corrugations===
Images from the &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;New Horizons&quot; space probes show the presence of two sets of spiraling vertical corrugations in the main ring. These waves became more tightly wound over time at the rate expected for differential nodal regression in Jupiter&#x27;s gravity field. Extrapolating backwards, the more prominent of the two sets of waves appears to have been excited in 1995, around the time of the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter, while the smaller set appears to date to the first half of 1990. &quot;Galileo&quot;&#x27;s November 1996 observations are consistent with wavelengths of and , and vertical amplitudes of and , for the larger and smaller sets of waves, respectively. The formation of the larger set of waves can be explained if the ring was impacted by a cloud of particles released by the comet with a total mass on the order of 2–5 × 1012 kg, which would have tilted the ring out of the equatorial plane by 2 km. A similar spiraling wave pattern that tightens over time has been observed by &quot;Cassini&quot; in Saturns&#x27;s C and D rings.

==Halo ring==

===Appearance and structure===

The halo ring is the innermost and the vertically thickest Jovian ring. Its outer edge coincides with the inner boundary of the main ring approximately at the radius (). From this radius the ring becomes rapidly thicker towards Jupiter. The true vertical extent of the halo is not known but the presence of its material was detected as high as over the ring plane. The inner boundary of the halo is relatively sharp and located at the radius (), but some material is present further inward to approximately . Thus the width of the halo ring is about . Its shape resembles a thick torus without clear internal structure. In contrast to the main ring, the halo&#x27;s appearance depends only slightly on the viewing geometry.

The halo ring appears brightest in forward-scattered light, in which it was extensively imaged by &quot;Galileo&quot;. While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated photon flux is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed vertical extent of more than , the halo&#x27;s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a power law of the form &quot;z&quot;−0.6 to &quot;z&quot;−1.5, where &quot;z&quot; is altitude over the ring plane. The halo&#x27;s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same. However its total photon flux is several times lower than that of the main ring and is more strongly concentrated near the ring plane than in the forward-scattered light.

The spectral properties of the halo ring are different from the main ring. The flux distribution in the range 0.5–2.5 μm is flatter than in the main ring; the halo is not red and may even be blue.

===Origin of the halo ring===
The optical properties of the halo ring can be explained by the hypothesis that it comprises only dust with particle sizes less than 15 μm. Parts of the halo located far from the ring plane may consist of submicrometre dust. This dusty composition explains the much stronger forward-scattering, bluer colors and lack of visible structure in the halo. The dust probably originates in the main ring, a claim supported by the fact that the halo&#x27;s optical depth formula_6 is comparable with that of the dust in the main ring. The large thickness of the halo can be attributed to the excitation of orbital inclinations and eccentricities of dust particles by the electromagnetic forces in the Jovian magnetosphere. The outer boundary of the halo ring coincides with location of a strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance. As Poynting–Robertson drag causes particles to slowly drift towards Jupiter, their orbital inclinations are excited while passing through it. The bloom of the main ring may be a beginning of the halo. The halo ring&#x27;s inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance. In this resonance the excitation is probably very significant, forcing particles to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere thus defining a sharp inner boundary. Being derived from the main ring, the halo has the same age.

==Gossamer rings==

===Amalthea gossamer ring===

The Amalthea gossamer ring is a very faint structure with a rectangular cross section, stretching from the orbit of Amalthea at (2.54 &quot;R&quot;) to about (). Its inner boundary is not clearly defined because of the presence of the much brighter main ring and halo. The thickness of the ring is approximately 2300 km near the orbit of Amalthea and slightly decreases in the direction of Jupiter. The Amalthea gossamer ring is actually the brightest near its top and bottom edges and becomes gradually brighter towards Jupiter; one of the edges is often brighter than another. The outer boundary of the ring is relatively steep; the ring&#x27;s brightness drops abruptly just inward of the orbit of Amalthea, although it may have a small extension beyond the orbit of the satellite ending near 4:3 resonance with Thebe. In forward-scattered light the ring appears to be about 30 times fainter than the main ring. In back-scattered light it has been detected only by the Keck telescope and the ACS (Advanced Camera for Surveys) on HST. Back-scattering images show additional structure in the ring: a peak in the brightness just inside the Amalthean orbit and confined to the top or bottom edge of the ring.

In 2002–2003 Galileo spacecraft had two passes through the gossamer rings. During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft&#x27;s star scanner detected small, discrete bodies (&lt; 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris generated from impacts with this satellite.

The detection of the Amalthea gossamer ring from the ground, in &quot;Galileo&quot; images and the direct dust measurements have allowed the determination of the particle size distribution, which appears to follow the same power law as the dust in the main ring with &quot;q&quot;=2 ± 0.5. The optical depth of this ring is about 10−7, which is an order of magnitude lower than that of the main ring, but the total mass of the dust (107–109 kg) is comparable.

===Thebe gossamer ring===
The Thebe gossamer ring is the faintest Jovian ring. It appears as a very faint structure with a rectangular cross section, stretching from the Thebean orbit at () to about (;). Its inner boundary is not clearly defined because of the presence of the much brighter main ring and halo. The thickness of the ring is approximately 8400 km near the orbit of Thebe and slightly decreases in the direction of the planet. The Thebe gossamer ring is brightest near its top and bottom edges and gradually becomes brighter towards Jupiter—much like the Amalthea ring. The outer boundary of the ring is not especially steep, stretching over . There is a barely visible continuation of the ring beyond the orbit of Thebe, extending up to () and called the Thebe Extension. In forward-scattered light the ring appears to be about 3 times fainter than the Amalthea gossamer ring. In back-scattered light it has been detected only by the Keck telescope. Back-scattering images show a peak of brightness just inside the orbit of Thebe. In 2002–2003 the dust counter of the Galileo spacecraft detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm—similar to those in the Amalthea ring—and confirmed the results obtained from imaging.

The optical depth of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 107–109 kg. However the particle size distribution of the dust is somewhat shallower than in the Amalthea ring. It follows a power law with q &lt; 2. In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be even smaller.

===Origin of the gossamer rings===
The dust in the gossamer rings originates in essentially the same way as that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.

However some properties have so far gone unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which may be due to unseen bodies outside Thebe&#x27;s orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring&#x27;s brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.

The peak in the brightness just inside of the Amalthea&#x27;s orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring may be due to the dust particles trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as well. This discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly drifts in the direction of Jupiter as described above, while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.

== Himalia ring ==

In September 2006, as NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto approached Jupiter for a gravity assist, it photographed what appeared to be a faint, previously unknown planetary ring or ring arc, parallel with and slightly inside the orbit of the irregular satellite Himalia. The amount of material in the part of the ring or arc imaged by &quot;New Horizons&quot; was at least 0.04 km3, assuming it had the same albedo as Himalia. If the ring (arc) is debris from Himalia, it must have formed quite recently, given the century-scale precession of the Himalian orbit. It is possible that the ring could be debris from the impact of a very small undiscovered moon into Himalia, suggesting that Jupiter might continue to gain and lose small moons through collisions.

==Exploration==
The existence of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring&#x27;s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.

<text>The Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, also known as the Big Four Railroad and commonly abbreviated CCC&amp;StL, was a railroad company in the Midwestern United States. It operated in affiliation with the New York Central system.

Its primary routes were in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. At the end of 1925 it reported 2,391 route-miles and 4,608 track-miles; that year it carried 8180 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 488 million passenger-miles.

==History==

The railroad was formed on June 30, 1889, by the merger of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway, the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway and the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railway. The following year, the company gained control of the former Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway (through the foreclosed Ohio, Indiana and Western Railway and through an operating agreement with the Peoria and Eastern Railway).

In 1906, the Big Four was acquired by the New York Central Railroad, which operated it as a separate entity until around 1930. The Big Four&#x27;s lines were later incorporated into Penn Central in 1968 with the merger of New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Penn Central declared bankruptcy in 1970, and in 1976 many of Big Four&#x27;s lines were included in the government-sponsored Conrail. Conrail was privatized in 1987 and in 1997 was jointly acquired by CSX and Norfolk Southern.

The railroad was headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, in the Chesapeake Building at 105 South Meridian Street. The building was constructed for the railroad in 1929 and was also known as the Big Four Building. In 1996, this multi-story structure became a Hampton Inn hotel.

Between 1904 and 1908 the railroad constructed a repair shop for steam locomotives and for passenger and freight cars in Beech Grove, Indiana. Amtrak purchased the facility, now known as the Beech Grove Shops, from the bankrupt Penn Central in 1975.

The railroad operated a terminal at Bellefontaine, Ohio, that included the largest roundhouse in use at that time between New York City and St. Louis, Missouri. Conrail closed the Bellefontaine terminal in 1983, and its roundhouse was dismantled.

A large yard facility known as the Big Four Yards is located in Avon, Indiana, along the line&#x27;s tracks, now owned and operated by CSX.

In 1895, the railroad acquired what became known as the Big Four Bridge across the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky, thereby giving it access to that city. Use of the bridge for railroad purposes ceased by 1968, and it sat abandoned until work began by 2006 to convert it to use by pedestrians and bicyclists.

<text>Each instrument used in analytical chemistry has a useful working range. This is the range of concentration (or mass) that can be adequately determined by the instrument, where the instrument provides a useful signal that can be related to the concentration of the analyte.

All instruments have an upper and a lower working limit. Concentrations below the working limit do not provide enough signal to be useful, and concentrations above the working limit provide too much signal to be useful. When calibrating an instrument for use, the experimenter must be familiar with both the lower and upper working range of the chosen instrument; results obtained from a sample of concentration outside the working range are often statistically uncertain.

<text>Mill Reef (23 February 1968 – 2 February 1986) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a three-year career from 1970 to 1972, he won twelve of fourteen races and finished second in the other two. The horse was an outstanding two-year-old in 1970 but proved even better at three, winning the Epsom Derby, the Eclipse Stakes, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. He won both his starts as a four-year-old before his racing career was ended by a severely broken leg that threatened his life. At just under 16 hands as a three-year-old, Mill Reef is considered one of the greatest thoroughbreds to run in Europe since WWII.

He recovered from a complicated operation on his broken leg to become a very successful stallion.

==Background==
Mill Reef was bred in the United States at the Rokeby Stables in Virginia of his owner and breeder, philanthropist Paul Mellon. He was a son of Never Bend out of the mare Milan Mill by Princequillo. When he was a yearling, it was thought that his action would be a better fit for a career on the turf courses of Europe rather than the dirt tracks in America. Therefore, he was sent to England in December 1969 to be trained by Paul Mellon&#x27;s young English trainer Ian Balding at Kingsclere. He was ridden by Geoff Lewis in all of his fourteen races. Mellon named the horse after the Mill Reef Club, on the island of Antigua in the West Indies and of which Paul Mellon was an early member. The Mellon family has maintained a home at Mill Reef since its founding in 1947.

As a yearling, Mill Reef showed himself to be an exceptional talent. Once, whilst visiting the stables and watching the yearlings being put through their paces on the Kingsclere gallops, the noted former amateur jockey and journalist Lord Oaksey asked, &quot;Who&#x27;s that?&quot; to which Balding replied, &quot;&quot;That&quot; is Mill Reef!&quot; He proved himself an outstanding two-year-old in 1970.

==Racing career==

===1970: two-year-old season===
Mill Reef made his debut in May in the Salisbury Stakes at Salisbury, where he beat the previous winner and 2-9 favourite, the Lester Piggott-ridden Fireside Chat, by four lengths. He then went to Royal Ascot winning the Coventry Stakes by six lengths, and the decision was made to go to France for the Prix Robert Papin at Maisons-Laffitte. After an arduous journey, Mill Reef tasted defeat for the first time by the narrowest of margins to another exceptional English two-year-old, My Swallow.

Back on home soil, he was entered in the Gimcrack Stakes at York in mid August. After a torrential overnight downpour turned the going into a quagmire, his trainer wanted to scratch him from the race. However, after discussions with his owner prior to the race, Paul Mellon said, &quot;Let him run, I&#x27;ve a feeling it will be alright.&quot; Mill Reef won by ten lengths from Green God (who was crowned champion sprinter the following year). In his next race, he beat the filly Hecla by a length in the Imperial Stakes at Kempton
. In his final race of the season, he won the prestigious Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket by four lengths.

In a crop of outstanding two-year-olds, Mill Reef was rated 1 lb below his French conqueror My Swallow, who remained unbeaten in seven races including all of France&#x27;s top two-year-old races, and 1 lb ahead of the unbeaten Middle Park Stakes winner, Brigadier Gerard.

===1971: three-year-old season===
As a three-year-old, following a victory in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury, Mill Reef was beaten three lengths in the 2,000 Guineas by Brigadier Gerard, who was to prove himself one of the best milers ever, with his old rival My Swallow back in third.

Although his breeding hinted otherwise, Mill Reef then proved himself to be the outstanding middle distance racehorse of the year, winning the Derby by two lengths from Linden Tree, the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown (beating the French colt Caro by four lengths) and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot by six lengths from Derby Italiano winner Ortis.

In October, he was victorious in the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in France, beating the French filly Pistol Packer by three lengths.

===1972: four-year-old season===
Kept in training as a four-year-old, Mill Reef returned to Longchamp to win the Prix Ganay in April 1972 by ten lengths. A summer rematch with Brigadier Gerard, who had also been kept in training as a four-year-old, was earmarked for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. But after a narrow win in the Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs, by a neck from Homeric, Mill Reef was found to be suffering from a heavy virus and the rematch had to be postponed.

After his recovery, Mill Reef was trained for an autumn campaign and a return to the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in October. During a routine training gallop, however, on 30 August he stumbled and shattered his foreleg. Charles Allen, a veterinary specialist, was flown in. Mill Reef&#x27;s fracture was complicated. A triangularly shaped piece of bone about two and a half inches long was broken from the lower end of the cannon bone and was considerably displaced. The inner sesamoid bone was completely shattered and the rim of the top of the main pastern bone was damaged. It seemed likely that the inner sesamoid bone was the first to break, with the result on the next step that the fetlock was not braced and the foot and the pastern were pointing outwards. The sheer pressure of the horse&#x27;s weight caused the crumbling of the rim of the pastern bone and the breaking of the cannon bone.

It was decided that an operation would be performed in a building in Ian Balding&#x27;s yard. Over a span of six hours, a simplified stainless-steel compression plate held by three screws was used to pin the broken pieces to the cannon bone. The injuries on the sesamoid bone or the rim of the pastern were avoided. The operation was successful. Professor Edwin James Roberts performed the operation and Mill Reef&#x27;s life was saved. His stable lad, John Hallum, played a major role in nursing him for three months, six weeks of which saw the horse in plaster. After the painstaking operation, Mill Reef&#x27;s racing career was over and he became a stallion at The National Stud in Newmarket in 1973.

==Stud career==
Mill Reef&#x27;s descendants include:

&quot;c = colt, f = filly&quot;

==Death==
Mill Reef was euthanised on 2 February 1986 and he is buried within the National Stud, where a statue stands in his memory.

==Assessment, honours and awards==
Mill Reef was given a rating of 141 by Timeform and is listed at no. 4 in the greatest racehorses of the twentieth century.

The Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury is named in his honour.

The following is inscribed on the plinth beneath his statue at the National Stud:

Swift as a bird I flew down many a course.&lt;br&gt;
Princes, Lords, Commoners all sang my praise.&lt;br&gt;
In victory or defeat I played my part.&lt;br&gt;
Remember me, all men who love the Horse,&lt;br&gt;
If hearts and spirits flag in after days;&lt;br&gt;
Though small, I gave my all. I gave my heart.&lt;br&gt;
(from Paul Mellon&#x27;s speech at the Gimcrack Dinner 1970).

The Royal Veterinary College&#x27;s Hawkshead Campus in Hertfordshire has a dedicated pathology building in memory of Mill Reef named the &quot;Mill Reef Building&quot;.

<doc id="979232" wikidata="Q171473" url="?curid=979232" title="Rings of Uranus">
<text>The rings of Uranus consists of 13 planetary rings. They are intermediate in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune. The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10, 1977, by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink. William Herschel had also reported observing rings in 1789; modern astronomers are divided on whether he could have seen them, as they are very dark and faint.

By 1977, nine distinct rings were identified. Two additional rings were discovered in 1986 in images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000 km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000 km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings&#x27; particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice with the addition of some dark radiation-processed organics.

The majority of Uranus&#x27; rings are opaque and only a few kilometres wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 20 cm to 20 m in diameter. Some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.

The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young, and not more than 600 million years old. The Uranian ring system probably originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability.

The mechanism that confines the narrow rings is not well understood. Initially it was assumed that every narrow ring had a pair of nearby shepherd moons corralling it into shape. In 1986 &quot;Voyager 2&quot; discovered only one such shepherd pair (Cordelia and Ophelia) around the brightest ring (ε), though the faint ν would later be discovered shepherded between Portia and Rosalind.

== Discovery ==
The first mention of a Uranian ring system comes from William Herschel&#x27;s notes detailing his observations of Uranus in the 18th century, which include the following passage: &quot;February 22, 1789: A ring was suspected&quot;. Herschel drew a small diagram of the ring and noted that it was &quot;a little inclined to the red&quot;. The Keck Telescope in Hawaii has since confirmed this to be the case, at least for the ν (nu) ring. Herschel&#x27;s notes were published in a Royal Society journal in 1797. In the two centuries between 1797 and 1977 the rings are rarely mentioned, if at all. This casts serious doubt on whether Herschel could have seen anything of the sort while hundreds of other astronomers saw nothing. It has been claimed that Herschel gave accurate descriptions of the ε ring&#x27;s size relative to Uranus, its changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun, and its color.

The definitive discovery of the Uranian rings was made by astronomers James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink on March 10, 1977, using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and was serendipitous. They planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by the planet. They deduced that a system of narrow rings was present. The five occultation events they observed were denoted by the Greek letters α, β, γ, δ and ε in their papers. These designations have been used as the rings&#x27; names since then. Later they found four additional rings: one between the β and γ rings and three inside the α ring. The former was named the η ring. The latter were dubbed rings 4, 5 and 6—according to the numbering of the occultation events in one paper. Uranus&#x27; ring system was the second to be discovered in the Solar System, after that of Saturn. In 1982, on the fifth anniversary of the rings&#x27; discovery, Uranus along with the eight other planets recognized at the time (i.e. including Pluto) aligned on the same side of the Sun.

The rings were directly imaged when the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft flew through the Uranian system in 1986. Two more faint rings were revealed, bringing the total to eleven. The Hubble Space Telescope detected an additional pair of previously unseen rings in 2003–2005, bringing the total number known to 13. The discovery of these outer rings doubled the known radius of the ring system. Hubble also imaged two small satellites for the first time, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered μ ring.

== General properties ==

As currently understood, the ring system of Uranus comprises thirteen distinct rings. In order of increasing distance from the planet they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν, μ rings. They can be divided into three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, ε), two dusty rings (1986U2R/ζ, λ) and two outer rings (ν, μ). The rings of Uranus consist mainly of macroscopic particles and little dust, although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/ζ, η, δ, λ, ν and μ rings. In addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs, which are sometimes detected during occultations. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007. A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering geometry by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. All rings of Uranus show azimuthal brightness variations.

The rings are made of an extremely dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. They cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, but it may be organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings&#x27; particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons.

As a whole, the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, some of which are composed of very bright material—water ice. There are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.

== Narrow main rings ==

=== ε (epsilon) ring ===

The ε ring is the brightest and densest part of the Uranian ring system, and is responsible for about two-thirds of the light reflected by the rings. While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings, it has negligible orbital inclination. The ring&#x27;s eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit. The radially integrated brightness of the ε ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near periapsis. The maximum/minimum brightness ratio is about 2.5–3.0. These variations are connected with the variations of the ring width, which is 19.7 km at the periapsis and 96.4 km at the apoapsis. As the ring becomes wider, the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view, leading to higher integrated brightness. The width variations were measured directly from &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images, as the ε ring was one of only two rings resolved by Voyager&#x27;s cameras. Such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin. Indeed, occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0.5 and 2.5, being highest near the periapsis. The equivalent depth of the ε ring is around 47 km and is invariant around the orbit.

The geometric thickness of the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150 m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0 m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus&#x27; extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed. The temperature of the ε ring was measured by ALMA to be .

The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft observed a strange signal from the ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6 cm near ring&#x27;s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires the existence of a coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.

The ε ring is known to have interior and exterior shepherd moons—Cordelia and Ophelia, respectively. The inner edge of the ring is in 24:25 resonance with Cordelia, and the outer edge is in 14:13 resonance with Ophelia. The masses of the moons need to be at least three times the mass of the ring to confine it effectively. The mass of the ε ring is estimated to be about 1016 kg.

===δ (delta) ring===

The δ ring is circular and slightly inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One possible explanation is that the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1 km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2 km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring&#x27;s broad component is about 10–12 km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3 km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3 × 10−2. This is known only from occultation data because &quot;Voyager 2&#x27;s&quot; imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.

===γ (gamma) ring===
The γ ring is narrow, optically dense and slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The width of the ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7 km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3 km. The normal optical depth of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, but it has been noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.

===η (eta) ring===
The η ring has zero orbital eccentricity and inclination. Like the δ ring, it consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 1.9–2.7 km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42 km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad component is about 40 km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85 km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2 × 10−2. It was resolved in &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated the presence of a considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad component is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.

The η ring is located close to a 3:2 Lindblad resonance with Uranian moon Cressida, which makes the ring to take the shape with three maxima and three minima in the radius, rotating with a pattering speed equal to the Cressida&#x27;s orbital motion.

===α (alpha) and β (beta) rings===
After the ε ring, the α and β rings are the brightest of Uranus&#x27; rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10 km and 6.1–11.4 km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29 km and 2.14 km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, which means they are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The masses of the α and β rings are estimated to be about 5 kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.

===Rings 6, 5 and 4===
Rings 6, 5 and 4 are the innermost and dimmest of Uranus&#x27; narrow rings. They are the most inclined rings, and their orbital eccentricities are the largest excluding the ε ring. In fact, their inclinations (0.06°, 0.05° and 0.03°) were large enough for &quot;Voyager 2&quot; to observe their elevations above the Uranian equatorial plane, which were 24–46 km. Rings 6, 5 and 4 are also the narrowest rings of Uranus, measuring 1.6–2.2 km, 1.9–4.9 km and 2.4–4.4 km wide, respectively. Their equivalent depths are 0.41 km, 0.91 and 0.71 km resulting in normal optical depth 0.18–0.25, 0.18–0.48 and 0.16–0.3. They were not visible during a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 due to their narrowness and lack of dust.

==Dusty rings==

===λ (lambda) ring===

The λ ring was one of two rings discovered by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2 km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2 km at the wavelength 2.2 μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36 km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2 μm was only announced in 1996.

The appearance of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometre-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this dust is 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring became one of the brightest features in the Uranian ring system.

Detailed analysis of the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images revealed azimuthal variations in the brightness of the λ ring. The variations appear to be periodic, resembling a standing wave. The origin of this fine structure in the λ ring remains a mystery.

===1986U2R/ζ (zeta) ring===

In 1986 &quot;Voyager 2&quot; detected a broad and faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was thought to be visible only in a single &quot;Voyager 2&quot; image, until reanalysis of Voyager data in 2022 revealed the ring in post-encounter images. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500 km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000 km above the clouds. It was not observed again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. The position of the recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350 km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600 km, or possibly even to 27,000 km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.

The ζ ring was observed again during the ring plane-crossing event in 2007 when it became the brightest feature of the ring system, outshining all other rings combined. The equivalent optical depth of this ring is near 1 km (1.5 km for the inward extension), the normal optical depth is about 10−2–10−3 and the vertical extent is 800–900 km. Rather different appearances of the 1986U2R and ζ rings may be caused by different viewing geometries: back-scattering geometry in 2003–2007 and side-scattering geometry in 1986. Changes during the past 20 years in the distribution of dust, which is thought to predominate in the ring, cannot be ruled out.

===Other dust bands===
In addition to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered light, but their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the &quot;Voyager&quot; observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about and the vertical extent is about 300 km. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index &quot;p&quot; = 2.5 ± 0.5.

In addition to separate dust bands the system of Uranian rings appears to be immersed into wide and faint sheet of dust with the normal optical depth not exceeding 10−3. This sheet extends from λ ring all the way to the planet and has the vertical extent of about 140 km.

==μ (mu) and ν (nu) rings==

In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings, now called the outer ring system, which brought the number of known Uranian rings to 13. These rings were subsequently named the μ (mu) and ν (nu) rings. The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice the distance from the planet as the bright η ring. The outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings in a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000 and 3,800 km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5 × 10−6 and 5.4 × 10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14 km and 0.012 km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.

The peak brightness of the μ (mu) ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably the source of the ring’s particles. The ν (nu) ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.

The μ ring may consist entirely of dust, without any large particles at all. This hypothesis is supported by observations performed by the Keck telescope, which failed to detect the μ ring in the near infrared at 2.2 μm, but detected the ν ring. This failure means that the μ ring is blue in color, which in turn indicates that very small (submicrometer) dust predominates within it. The dust may be made of water ice. In contrast, the ν ring is slightly red in color.

==Dynamics and origin==

An outstanding problem concerning the physics governing the narrow Uranian rings is their confinement. Without some mechanism to hold their particles together, the rings would quickly spread out radially. The lifetime of the Uranian rings without such a mechanism cannot be more than 1 million years. The most widely cited model for such confinement, proposed initially by Goldreich and Tremaine, is that a pair of nearby moons, outer and inner shepherds, interact gravitationally with a ring and act like sinks and donors, respectively, for excessive and insufficient angular momentum (or equivalently, energy). The shepherds thus keep ring particles in place, but gradually move away from the ring themselves. To be effective, the masses of the shepherds should exceed the mass of the ring by at least a factor of two to three. This mechanism is known to be at work in the case of the ε ring, where Cordelia and Ophelia serve as shepherds. Cordelia is also the outer shepherd of the δ ring, and Ophelia is the outer shepherd of the γ ring. No moon larger than 10 km is known in the vicinity of other rings. The current distance of Cordelia and Ophelia from the ε ring can be used to estimate the ring’s age. The calculations show that the ε ring cannot be older than 600 million years.

Since the rings of Uranus appear to be young, they must be continuously renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. A few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10 km.

The origin of the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be continuously replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.

==Exploration==
The rings were thoroughly investigated by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft in January 1986. Two new faint rings—λ and 1986U2R—were discovered bringing the total number then known to eleven. Rings were studied by analyzing results of radio, ultraviolet and optical occultations. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observed the rings in different geometries relative to the Sun, producing images with back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the complete phase function, geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Two rings—ε and η—were resolved in the images revealing a complicated fine structure. Analysis of Voyager&#x27;s images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of Uranus, including the two shepherd moons of the ε ring—Cordelia and Ophelia.

<text>The rings of Neptune consist primarily of five principal rings. They were first discovered (as &quot;arcs&quot;) by simultaneous observations of a stellar occultation on 22 July 1984 by André Brahic&#x27;s and William B. Hubbard&#x27;s teams at La Silla Observatory (ESO) and at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile. They were eventually imaged in 1989 by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft. At their densest, they are comparable to the less dense portions of Saturn&#x27;s main rings such as the C ring and the Cassini Division, but much of Neptune&#x27;s ring system is quite faint and dusty, in some aspects more closely resembling the rings of Jupiter. Neptune&#x27;s rings are named after astronomers who contributed important work on the planet: Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. Neptune also has a faint unnamed ring coincident with the orbit of the moon Galatea. Three other moons orbit between the rings: Naiad, Thalassa and Despina.

The rings of Neptune are made of extremely dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to those found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their stability is probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.

== Discovery and observations ==

The first mention of rings around Neptune dates back to 1846 when William Lassell, the discoverer of Neptune&#x27;s largest moon, Triton, thought he had seen a ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star&#x27;s brightness during one occultation; however, the manner in which the star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.

In the 1980s, significant occultations were much rarer for Neptune than for Uranus, which lay near the Milky Way at the time and was thus moving against a denser field of stars. Neptune&#x27;s next occultation, on 12 September 1983, resulted in a possible detection of a ring. However, ground-based results were inconclusive. Over the next six years, approximately 50 other occultations were observed with only about one-third of them yielding positive results. Something (probably incomplete arcs) definitely existed around Neptune, but the features of the ring system remained a mystery. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft made the definitive discovery of the Neptunian rings during its fly-by of Neptune in 1989, passing by as close as above the planet&#x27;s atmosphere on 25 August. It confirmed that occasional occultation events observed before were indeed caused by the arcs within the Adams ring (see below). After the &quot;Voyager&quot; fly-by the previous terrestrial occultation observations were reanalyzed yielding features of the ring&#x27;s arcs as they were in 1980s, which matched those found by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; almost perfectly.

Since &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s fly-by, the brightest rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths in which the glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold for these instruments. In 2022 the rings were imaged by the James Webb Space Telescope, which made the first observation of the fainter rings since the &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s fly-by.

== General properties ==

Neptune possesses five distinct rings named, in order of increasing distance from the planet, Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams. In addition to these well-defined rings, Neptune may also possess an extremely faint sheet of material stretching inward from the Le Verrier to the Galle ring, and possibly farther in toward the planet. Three of the Neptunian rings are narrow, with widths of about 100 km or less; in contrast, the Galle and Lassell rings are broad—their widths are between 2,000 and 5,000 km. The Adams ring consists of five bright arcs embedded in a fainter continuous ring. Proceeding counterclockwise, the arcs are: Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The first four names come from &quot;liberty, equality, fraternity&quot;, the motto of the French Revolution and Republic. The terminology was suggested by their original discoverers, who had found them during stellar occultations in 1984 and 1985. Four small Neptunian moons have orbits inside the ring system: Naiad and Thalassa orbit in the gap between the Galle and Le Verrier rings; Despina is just inward of the Le Verrier ring; and Galatea lies slightly inward of the Adams ring, embedded in an unnamed faint, narrow ringlet.

The Neptunian rings contain a large quantity of micrometer-sized dust: the dust fraction by cross-section area is between 20% and 70%. In this respect they are similar to the rings of Jupiter, in which the dust fraction is 50%–100%, and are very different from the rings of Saturn and Uranus, which contain little dust (less than 0.1%). The particles in Neptune&#x27;s rings are made from a dark material; probably a mixture of ice with radiation-processed organics. The rings are reddish in color, and their geometrical (0.05) and Bond (0.01–0.02) albedos are similar to those of the Uranian rings&#x27; particles and the inner Neptunian moons. The rings are generally optically thin (transparent); their normal optical depths do not exceed 0.1. As a whole, the Neptunian rings resemble those of Jupiter; both systems consist of faint, narrow, dusty ringlets and even fainter broad dusty rings.

The rings of Neptune, like those of Uranus, are thought to be relatively young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune&#x27;s rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; between the main rings of Uranus.

== Inner rings ==
=== Galle ring ===
The innermost ring of Neptune is called the &quot;Galle ring&quot; after Johann Gottfried Galle, the first person to see Neptune through a telescope (1846). It is about 2,000 km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000 km from the planet. It is a faint ring with an average normal optical depth of around 10−4, and with an equivalent depth of 0.15 km. The fraction of dust in this ring is estimated from 40% to 70%.
=== Le Verrier ring ===
The next ring is named the &quot;Le Verrier ring&quot; after Urbain Le Verrier, who predicted Neptune&#x27;s position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200 km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113 km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062 ± 0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7 ± 0.2 km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just inside of it at 52,526 km, may play a role in the ring&#x27;s confinement by acting as a shepherd.
=== Lassell ring ===
The &quot;Lassell ring&quot;, also known as the &quot;plateau&quot;, is the broadest ring in the Neptunian system. Its namesake is William Lassell, the English astronomer who discovered Neptune&#x27;s largest moon, Triton. This ring is a faint sheet of material occupying the space between the Le Verrier ring at about 53,200 km and the Arago ring at 57,200 km. Its average normal optical depth is around 10−4, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.4 km. The ring&#x27;s dust fraction is in the range from 20% to 40%.
==== Potential ring ====
There is a small peak of brightness near the outer edge of the Lassell ring, located at 57,200 km from Neptune and less than 100 km wide, which some planetary scientists call the &quot;Arago ring&quot; after François Arago, a French mathematician, physicist, astronomer and politician. However, many publications do not mention the Arago ring at all.

== Adams ring ==

The outer Adams ring, with an orbital radius of about 63,930 km, is the best studied of Neptune&#x27;s rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who predicted the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35 km (15–50 km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011 ± 0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4 km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune&#x27;s small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953 km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea&#x27;s gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the Adams ring with an amplitude of about 30 km, which have been used to infer Galatea&#x27;s mass.

=== Arcs ===
The brightest parts of the Adams ring, the ring arcs, were the first elements of Neptune&#x27;s ring system to be discovered. The arcs are discrete regions within the ring in which the particles that it comprises are mysteriously clustered together. The Adams ring is known to comprise five short arcs, which occupy a relatively narrow range of longitudes from 247° to 294°. In 1986 they were located between longitudes of:
* 247–257° (Fraternité),
* 261–264° (Égalité 1),
* 265–266° (Égalité 2),
* 276–280° (Liberté),
* 284.5–285.5° (Courage).
The brightest and longest arc was Fraternité; the faintest was Courage. The normal optical depths of the arcs are estimated to lie in the range 0.03–0.09 (0.034 ± 0.005 for the leading edge of Liberté arc as measured by stellar occultation); the radial widths are approximately the same as those of the continuous ring—about 30 km. The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15 km (0.77 ± 0.13 km for the leading edge of Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%. The arcs in the Adams ring are somewhat similar to the arc in Saturn&#x27;s G ring.

The highest resolution &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images revealed a pronounced clumpiness in the arcs, with a typical separation between visible clumps of 0.1° to 0.2°, which corresponds to 100–200 km along the ring. Because the clumps were not resolved, they may or may not include larger bodies, but are certainly associated with concentrations of microscopic dust as evidenced by their enhanced brightness when backlit by the Sun.

The arcs are quite stable structures. They were detected by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at approximately the same orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; it was back to its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.

=== Confinement ===

The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their existence is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply that they should spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several hypotheses about the arcs&#x27; confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring&#x27;s orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings&#x27; mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led to the conclusion that the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.

A later model suggested that confinement resulted from a co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model takes into account the finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this hypothesis is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third hypothesis proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a hypothesis unlikely. Some other more complicated hypotheses hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.

== Exploration ==
The rings were investigated in detail during the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft&#x27;s flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical imaging, and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries relative to the Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring&#x27;s reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager&#x27;s images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd Galatea.

<doc id="979241" wikidata="Q163019" url="?curid=979241" title="Chip Reese">
<text>David Edward&quot;Chip&quot;Reese (March 28, 1951 – December 4, 2007) was an American professional poker player and gambler from Centerville, Ohio. He is widely regarded as having been the greatest cash game poker player.

==Early life==
Reese suffered from rheumatic fever during his years at elementary school and had to stay at home for almost a year. During this time, his mother taught him how to play several board and card games. Reese later described himself as &quot;a product of that year.&quot; By the age of six, he was regularly beating fifth-graders at poker. In high school, he was a football player and was on the debate team, winning an Ohio State Championship and going to the National Finals.

Reese attended Dartmouth after turning down an offer from Harvard. At Dartmouth, he became a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity, played freshman football briefly, participated in debate, and majored in economics. Reese also had tremendous success in poker games against students and some of his professors. He taught his fraternity brothers to play a variety of card games, including bridge as well as many poker variants. Reese played bridge occasionally at the Grafton County Grange. His fraternity later named their chapter card room, the &quot;David E. Reese Memorial Card Room&quot; in his honor. Reese had a brief interest in Stanford Business School but decided instead to play poker professionally after winning $60,000 in a high/low split game in Las Vegas.

Reese&#x27;s first visit to Las Vegas was so financially rewarding and so much fun, that he never left. He is thought to have hired someone to fly to Arizona to clean out his apartment and drive his car to Las Vegas.

==Poker career==
Shortly afterwards, Reese collaborated on the seven-card stud section for Doyle Brunson&#x27;s &quot;Super/System&quot;, the best-selling poker book of all time. In it, Brunson describes Reese as &quot;one of the two finest young … poker players in the world&quot; and the best seven-card stud player he had ever played. He won the $1,000 Seven Card Stud Split event at the World Series of Poker in 1978, and the $5,000 Seven Card Stud event in 1982. Reese decided to concentrate his efforts on cash games, however.
He later became the card room manager at the Dunes casino. Brunson says he once lost $6 million to Reese. In 1991, Reese became the youngest living player to be inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame. By 2006, he was still playing poker, also betting on sports.

At the 2006 World Series of Poker, Reese won the inaugural $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event, taking home the $1,716,000 first prize when his held up against Andy Bloch&#x27;s in the final hand, on a board of . This event was notable for having the largest buy-in (at the time) in WSOP history, as well as the longest heads-up battle with Reese and Bloch playing for seven hours and 286 hands. By comparison, the final table of the 2005 World Series of Poker Main Event lasted for a total of 232 hands.

As a tribute, the &quot;David &#x27;Chip&#x27; Reese Memorial Trophy&quot; was inaugurated in 2008 as an additional prize for the winner of the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event at the World Series of Poker. The trophy depicts his winning hand of . Starting in 2010, the trophy was awarded to the winner of The Poker Player&#x27;s Championship, the replacement for the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event. Retaining the $50,000 buy-in, the event added no-limit hold &#x27;em, pot-limit Omaha, and limit 2–7 triple draw to the five H.O.R.S.E. games, which culminated with a no-limit hold &#x27;em final table in the first two years for tv (2010 and 2011), since which the mixed game format is played until the champion is crowned

Reese&#x27;s total live tournament winnings exceeded $3,900,000.

==Death==

Reese died on December 4, 2007, at his Las Vegas home. Some sources state that Reese died in his sleep from the effects of pneumonia, while friends of Chip, including Barry Greenstein and Doyle Brunson, speculate that his death might have been related to an earlier gastric bypass that caused a blood clot.

Upon learning of Reese&#x27;s death, Doyle Brunson stated, &quot;He&#x27;s certainly the best poker player that ever lived.&quot; World Series of Poker commissioner Jeffrey Pollack said upon his death that many consider Chip &quot;the greatest cash game player who ever lived, but he was also a World Series of Poker legend.&quot;

Reese&#x27;s house in Las Vegas was put up for sale on June 8, 2008, at a price of $5,699,500. He purchased the house with winnings from sports betting in baseball and from an investment in Jack Binion&#x27;s Tunica casino.

<text>Burton on the Wolds is a village in Leicestershire, England situated on the B676 road west of the A46 and about the same distance to the east of Loughborough, close to the county border with Nottinghamshire. In the 2011 census, the population was measured at 1,218. The Parish Council of Burton on the Wolds, Cotes and Prestwold serves the village and its two neighbouring hamlets. The local borough council is Charnwood.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;farm/settlement with a fortification&#x27;.

The village is listed in the Domesday Book, showing it comprised 15 households in the year 1086. In the Middle Ages Burton was the property of Garendon Abbey. After World War II a Polish camp was set up in the village, due to its proximity to RAF Wymeswold which opened in 1942 and closed in 1957. It now hosts an industrial complex containing Jump Giants Loughborough.

Burton has its own primary school, pub and shop (in the garage).

The Lion&#x27;s Head water fountain was probably built in the mid 19th century.

Prestwold Hall, which was built in the 18th century, is within the parish of Prestwold, but part of the grounds fall within the Burton on the Wolds parish.

==Sport==
The village has two football teams that play in the North Leicestershire League division one, and the Charnwood Sunday League division one. Home games are played at Towles Fields.

Burton also has a long-established cricket club who in 2010 merged with one of the County&#x27;s largest and most successful clubs, Barrow Town. Now named Barrow and Burton Cricket Club, the club has four teams represented in the Everards Leicestershire County Cricket League and also the Leicestershire Senior Cricket League.

<text>Nyanga, originally known as Inyanga, is a town in Zimbabwe.

==Location==
It is located in Nyanga District, Manicaland Province, in Eastern Highland of Zimbabwe, along the international border with Mozambique. This location lies immediately north of Nyanga National Park in the Eastern Highlands, about , by road, north of Mutare, the third large city. This location lies approximately , by road, east of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe and the largest city in that country. Nyanga sits at an elevation of , above sea level.

==Climate==
==Overview==
Mount Nyangani, the highest mountain in Zimbabwe, lies about , southeast of the town. Its highest peak rises to approximately , above sea level. Nyanga is primarily a tourist town and is a popular tourist destination with its fishing, golf courses, mountain hikes and holiday resorts. The Mtarazi Falls, inside Nyanga National Park, are the highest waterfalls in the country, cascading about , from top to bottom. The surrounding areas also contain many Stone Age and Iron Age archaeological remains such as pit structures, stone forts, terraces and pathways. Inside the town is the bustling township of Nyamhuka, around which there is an ever expanding growth of high and medium-density housing. Nyanga is also host to the largest army training camp in Zimbabwe, hosting recruits from across Africa.

==History==
The Nyanga region has long been regarded as a place of great natural beauty. In 1896, Cecil John Rhodes wrote to his agent: &quot;Dear McDonald, Inyanga is much finer than you described...Before it is all gone, buy me quickly up to , and be sure to take in the &quot;Pungwe Falls&quot;. I would like to try sheep and apple growing.&quot; Rhodes displaced the inhabitants and the chieftainship of the wonderful place- the Sakarombes of the Lion-Zebra (Shumba-Nyambizi totem) who found refuge in the semi-arid areas of Nyanga in Ruwangwe.
Nyanga has been made famous in Scotland by the 1960 Hamish Henderson song Freedom Come-All-Ye as the birthplace of an unnamed black man who will overthrow the Afrikaaner Government.

==Population==
The current population of Nyanga is not publicly known. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 2,973. In 2004, the population of the town was estimated at 4,850. The next national population census in Zimbabwe is scheduled from 18 August 2012 through 28 August 2012.

<doc id="979251" wikidata="Q801780" url="?curid=979251" title="Orbital maneuver">
<text>In spaceflight, an orbital maneuver (otherwise known as a burn) is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft. 
For spacecraft far from Earth, an orbital maneuver is called a &quot;deep-space maneuver (DSM)&quot;.

When a spacecraft is not conducting a maneuver, especially in a transfer orbit, it is said to be &quot;coasting&quot;.

==General==

===Rocket equation===
The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, or ideal rocket equation, can be useful for analysis of maneuvers by vehicles using rocket propulsion. A rocket applies acceleration to itself (a thrust) by expelling part of its mass at high speed. The rocket itself moves due to the conservation of momentum.

=== Delta-v ===

The applied change in velocity of each maneuver is referred to as delta-v (formula_1).

The delta-v for all the expected maneuvers are estimated for a mission are summarized in a delta-v budget. With a good approximation of the delta-v budget designers can estimate the propellant required for planned maneuvers.

== Propulsion ==

===Impulsive maneuvers===

An impulsive maneuver is the mathematical model of a maneuver as an instantaneous change in the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity (magnitude and/or direction) as illustrated in figure 1. It is the limit case of a burn to generate a particular amount of delta-v, as the burn time tends to zero.

In the physical world no truly instantaneous change in velocity is possible as this would require an &quot;infinite force&quot; applied during an &quot;infinitely short time&quot; but as a mathematical model it in most cases describes the effect of a maneuver on the orbit very well.

The off-set of the velocity vector after the end of real burn from the velocity vector at the same time resulting from the theoretical impulsive maneuver is only caused by the difference in gravitational force along the two paths (red and black in figure 1) which in general is small.

In the planning phase of space missions designers will first approximate their intended orbital changes using impulsive maneuvers that greatly reduces the complexity of finding the correct orbital transitions.

=== Low thrust propulsion ===
Applying a low thrust over a longer period of time is referred to as a non-impulsive maneuver. &#x27;Non-impulsive&#x27; refers to the momentum changing slowly over a long time, as in electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, rather than by a short impulse.

Another term is &quot;finite burn&quot;, where the word &quot;finite&quot; is used to mean &quot;non-zero&quot;, or practically, again: over a longer period.

For a few space missions, such as those including a space rendezvous, high fidelity models of the trajectories are required to meet the mission goals. Calculating a &quot;finite&quot; burn requires a detailed model of the spacecraft and its thrusters. The most important of details include: mass, center of mass, moment of inertia, thruster positions, thrust vectors, thrust curves, specific impulse, thrust centroid offsets, and fuel consumption.

==Assists==

===Oberth effect===

In astronautics, the Oberth effect is where the use of a rocket engine when travelling at high speed generates much more useful energy than one at low speed. Oberth effect occurs because the propellant has more usable energy (due to its kinetic energy on top of its chemical potential energy) and it turns out that the vehicle is able to employ this kinetic energy to generate more mechanical power. It is named after Hermann Oberth, the Austro-Hungarian-born, German physicist and a founder of modern rocketry, who apparently first described the effect.

The Oberth effect is used in a powered flyby or Oberth maneuver where the application of an impulse, typically from the use of a rocket engine, close to a gravitational body (where the gravity potential is low, and the speed is high) can give much more change in kinetic energy and final speed (i.e. higher specific energy) than the same impulse applied further from the body for the same initial orbit.

Since the Oberth maneuver happens in a very limited time (while still at low altitude), to generate a high impulse the engine necessarily needs to achieve high thrust (impulse is by definition the time multiplied by thrust). Thus the Oberth effect is far less useful for low-thrust engines, such as ion thrusters.

Historically, a lack of understanding of this effect led investigators to conclude that interplanetary travel would require completely impractical amounts of propellant, as without it, enormous amounts of energy are needed.

===Gravity assist===
In astrodynamics a gravity assist maneuver, gravitational slingshot or swing-by is the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet or other celestial body to alter the trajectory of a spacecraft, typically in order to save propellant, time, and expense. Gravity assistance can be used to accelerate, decelerate and/or re-direct the path of a spacecraft.

The &quot;assist&quot; is provided by the motion (orbital angular momentum) of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft. The technique was first proposed as a mid-course maneuver in 1961, and used by interplanetary probes from &quot;Mariner 10&quot; onwards, including the two &quot;Voyager&quot; probes&#x27; notable fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn.

==Transfer orbits==
Orbit insertion maneuvers leave a spacecraft in a destination orbit. In contrast, orbit injection maneuvers occur when a spacecraft enters a transfer orbit, e.g. trans-lunar injection (TLI), trans-Mars injection (TMI) and trans-Earth injection (TEI). These are generally larger than small trajectory correction maneuvers. Insertion, injection and sometimes initiation are used to describe entry into a &quot;descent orbit&quot;, e.g. the Powered Descent Initiation maneuver used for Apollo lunar landings.

===Hohmann transfer===
In orbital mechanics, the Hohmann transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit used to transfer between two circular orbits of different altitudes, in the same plane.

The orbital maneuver to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses which move a spacecraft onto and off the transfer orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann, the German scientist who published a description of it in his 1925 book &quot;Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelskörper&quot; (&quot;The Accessibility of Celestial Bodies&quot;). Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author Kurd Laßwitz and his 1897 book &quot;Two Planets&quot;.

===Bi-elliptic transfer===
In astronautics and aerospace engineering, the bi-elliptic transfer is an orbital maneuver that moves a spacecraft from one orbit to another and may, in certain situations, require less delta-v than a Hohmann transfer maneuver.

The bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half elliptic orbits. From the initial orbit, a delta-v is applied boosting the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an apoapsis at some point formula_2 away from the central body. At this point, a second delta-v is applied sending the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with periapsis at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third delta-v is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.

While they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally requires a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial semi-major axis is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.

The idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first published by Ary Sternfeld in 1934.

===Low energy transfer===

A low energy transfer, or low energy trajectory, is a route in space which allows spacecraft to change orbits using very little fuel. These routes work in the Earth-Moon system and also in other systems, such as traveling between the satellites of Jupiter. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take much longer to complete than higher energy (more fuel) transfers such as Hohmann transfer orbits.

Low energy transfer are also known as weak stability boundary trajectories, or ballistic capture trajectories.

Low energy transfers follow special pathways in space, sometimes referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network. Following these pathways allows for long distances to be traversed for little expenditure of delta-v.

===Orbital inclination change===

Orbital inclination change is an orbital maneuver aimed at changing the inclination of an orbiting body&#x27;s orbit. This maneuver is also known as an orbital plane change as the plane of the orbit is tipped. This maneuver requires a change in the orbital velocity vector (delta v) at the orbital nodes (i.e. the point where the initial and desired orbits intersect, the line of orbital nodes is defined by the intersection of the two orbital planes).

In general, inclination changes can require a great deal of delta-v to perform, and most mission planners try to avoid them whenever possible to conserve fuel. This is typically achieved by launching a spacecraft directly into the desired inclination, or as close to it as possible so as to minimize any inclination change required over the duration of the spacecraft life.

Maximum efficiency of inclination change is achieved at apoapsis, (or apogee), where orbital velocity formula_3 is the lowest. In some cases, it may require less total delta v to raise the spacecraft into a higher orbit, change the orbit plane at the higher apogee, and then lower the spacecraft to its original altitude.

===Constant-thrust trajectory===
Constant-thrust and constant-acceleration trajectories involve the spacecraft firing its engine in a prolonged constant burn. In the limiting case where the vehicle acceleration is high compared to the local gravitational acceleration, the spacecraft points straight toward the target (accounting for target motion), and remains accelerating constantly under high thrust until it reaches its target. In this high-thrust case, the trajectory approaches a straight line. If it is required that the spacecraft rendezvous with the target, rather than performing a flyby, then the spacecraft must flip its orientation halfway through the journey, and decelerate the rest of the way.

In the constant-thrust trajectory, the vehicle&#x27;s acceleration increases during thrusting period, since the fuel use means the vehicle mass decreases. If, instead of constant thrust, the vehicle has constant acceleration, the engine thrust must decrease during the trajectory.

This trajectory requires that the spacecraft maintain a high acceleration for long durations. For interplanetary transfers, days, weeks or months of constant thrusting may be required. As a result, there are no currently available spacecraft propulsion systems capable of using this trajectory. It has been suggested that some forms of nuclear (fission or fusion based) or antimatter powered rockets would be capable of this trajectory.

More practically, this type of maneuver is used in low thrust maneuvers, for example with ion engines, Hall-effect thrusters, and others. These types of engines have very high specific impulse (fuel efficiency) but currently are only available with fairly low absolute thrust.

==Rendezvous and docking==

===Orbit phasing===

In astrodynamics orbit phasing is the adjustment of the time-position of spacecraft along its orbit, usually described as adjusting the orbiting spacecraft&#x27;s true anomaly.

===Space rendezvous and docking===
A space rendezvous is a sequence of orbital maneuvers during which two spacecraft, one of which is often a space station, arrive at the same orbit and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the orbital velocities of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through orbital station-keeping. Rendezvous is commonly followed by docking or berthing, procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.

<text>The Pastoral Review (formerly Clergy Review and then Priests &amp; People) is an international academic journal serving ordained and lay ministers in the Roman Catholic Church since 1931, published by the Tablet Publishing Co of England. 

Its prior editor was David Sanders, who was succeeded at the beginning of 2005 by Michael Hayes, then head of the School of theology, philosophy, and history and subsequently vice principal of St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, University of Surrey, and then president of Mary Immaculate College in Limerick until his death in April 2017. The editor from April 2017 until his death in June 2022 was Anthony Towey. The current editor is Ashley Beck, also based at St Mary&#x27;s University.

An unrelated &#x27;journal and a record of all matters affecting the pastoral and agricultural interests throughout Australasia&#x27; with the same name was published from 1913-1977.

==Annual congress==
Annually in early summer, a two-day gathering of theology and faith at the service of the Gospel in the parish, school, home and workplace is held on the ground of St. Mary&#x27;s campus. Workshops and lectures range from concepts in scripture, divinity in modern forms, interaction with art, media, outreach, and other topics.

==As a research publication==
*A 1964 article, &quot;Mary: Sign of Contradiction or Source of Unity&quot; was cited in the 1979 book &quot;Multiple Echo Explorations in Theology&quot; by Cornelius Ernst.
*A 2007 article, &quot;International Presbyterates&quot; by Ronald Knott was cited in the book &quot;Who Do We Think We Are?: How Catholic Priests Understand Themselves Today&quot; by Christopher A. Fallon.
*A 2010 article, &quot;Ongoing Priestly Formation: Option or Necessity?&quot; was cited in the book &quot;Gold Tested in Fire: A New Pentecost for the Catholic Priesthood&quot; by Ronald D. Witherup.
*A 2015 paper called &quot;Child slavery and child labour&quot;, relating to Catholic social teaching, was presented at the University of Glasgow, the source material for which was a series in The Pastoral Review.

==Prominent contributors==

<text>John P. Walters (born February 8, 1952) is the president and chief executive officer of Hudson Institute; he was appointed in January 2021. He joined Hudson in 2009 as the executive vice president and most recently was the chief operating officer. Previously, Walters was Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in the George W. Bush administration. He held that position from February 5, 2001, to January 20, 2009. As the U.S. &quot;Drug Czar&quot;, Walters coordinated all aspects of federal anti-drug policies and spending. As drug czar, he was a staunch opponent of drug decriminalization, legalization, and medical marijuana.

==Background==
He was Assistant to the Secretary at the U.S. Department of Education in the Reagan Administration. He was the Secretary&#x27;s representative to the National Drug Policy Board and the Domestic Policy Council&#x27;s Health Policy Working Group. From 1989 to 1991, Walters was chief of staff for William Bennett and was Deputy Director for Supply Reduction from 1991 until leaving the office in 1993.

Walters served as Acting Assistant Director and Program Officer in the Division of Education Programs at the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1982 to 1985. He has previously taught political science at Michigan State University&#x27;s James Madison College and at Boston College. From 1996 until 2001 he served as president of the Philanthropy Roundtable.

He holds a BA from Michigan State University&#x27;s James Madison College and a MA from the University of Toronto.

On April 7, 2023, Walters was sanctioned by the Chinese government after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen gave a speech at the Hudson Institute.

==Policy views==
Walters is opposed to the decriminalization and legalization of narcotics. Speaking of marijuana legalization in Colorado, he said, &quot;My argument is look to Colorado: it’s getting worse. That’s exactly what they said they were going to do. Tax it; regulate it; we’re going to keep it away from kids; higher rate. I visited people shortly after the legalization in Denver. I was struck by a woman who said, &#x27;I’m terrified for my children. We now are told our children cannot bring food or beverages to school.&#x27; Anything they consume in the school must be made under school supervision because, of course, you have brownies, fruit juices, candies, other kinds of things that are infused with cannabis or THC and can be used to poison these children.&quot;

Walters is a supporter of drug rehabilitation in place of incarceration to help drug users. In an interview, he said, &quot;When I was in office, the criminal-justice system was the single largest category of institutions referring people to treatment using drug courts and diversion programs. Don’t send them to prison. Let’s get them into treatment because that’s what’s really causing their lives to be so self-destructive to themselves and to others. And it was that law and it was that effort.&quot;

<text>Kevin C. Young (born September 16, 1966) is an American former athlete. He was the winner of the 400 metres hurdles at the 1992 Summer Olympics. In the final of this event he set a world record and Olympic record of 46.78 seconds, the first time the 47-second barrier was broken, and a world record that stood for nearly 29 years until it was broken by Karsten Warholm on July 1, 2021.

He became the 400 m hurdles world champion the following year, winning at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics with a time of 47.18 seconds. He had an unusual hurdling technique of switching between 12 and 13 strides between the hurdles, departing from the 13-stride technique popularized by Edwin Moses.

Young&#x27;s performances declined after 1993. He was inducted into the National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Career==

===Early life===
At Jordan High School, the same high school that Florence Griffith-Joyner had attended years earlier, Young was first successful as a 110-meter hurdler, finishing in third place at the 1984 CIF California State Meet. As a UCLA &quot;walk-on&quot;, Young was 5th place at the 1985 Pac-10 championships running the 400-meter hurdles in 51.09 seconds. This all changed his sophomore year. Limiting the amount of time and effort in other events (110 hurdles, triple jump, and long jump) he applied more detail towards the 400-meter hurdles and 4×400-meter relay. The Bruin won the 1986 Pac-10 400 m hurdles title on the advice of Andre Phillips sharing his knowledge of running this distance at the Los Angeles Coliseum under windy conditions. There he set a then Pac-10 record of 49.02 seconds. While in Indiana for that year&#x27;s 1986 NCAA Championships, Young was a surprise second-place finisher behind the 1984 Olympic silver medalists, Danny Harris of Iowa State. While running between the fourth and fifth hurdles, he took eleven (11) strides between the barriers, a feat only repeated by him six years later during the first round of 1992 Barcelona Olympic 400-meter hurdles. At the 1987 NCAA championships at LSU, he captured a pair of NCAA titles in 400-meter hurdles and 4×400-meter relay. He and his Bruin 4×400 m relay teammates of Anthony Washington, Henry Thomas, and Danny Everett set a then NCAA and collegiate record of 3:00.55. In 1988 during his senior year at UCLA, Young defended his third PacC-10 400 m hurdles title and won his second NCAA 400 m hurdles title, running 47.85 seconds. With the addition of California prep 400 m specialist Steven Lewis, the Bruins&#x27; 4 × 400 m relay team became the first ever collegiate team to run under 3 minutes (2:59.91; relay splits: Steve Lewis 45.1, Kevin Young 44.3, Danny Everett, 45.4, Henry Thomas 45.1), 2:59.91 CR. These records stood for 17 years, with the 400 m hurdles being broken by Kerron Clement (47.56) and relay by LSU (2:59.59). Kevin Young finished his senior year as team captain and the most valuable male collegiate athlete in the United States, winning the Jumbo Elliott Award. Young graduated from UCLA setting junior and senior class records in the 400 m hurdles (48.15 and 47.72 respectively).

Young made his debut in international competition at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, USSR, and later at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis placing second. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, Young finished fourth just behind Edwin Moses (whose record Young would replace four years later) in his final race. At the 1991 World Championships, Young was again fourth.

===Olympic gold and world record===

In 1992, Young won his first USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships title and was unbeaten prior to the Barcelona Olympics. Running in lane 4, Young appeared to have the slowest reaction to the gun of the field. To his inside, Winthrop Graham was the first over the first hurdle. Using a left leg lead, 13 strides to the second hurdle, he had pulled to just slightly behind Graham. Between the next two hurdles he ran 12 strides, alternating to the right leg lead over the fourth hurdle. Over the fifth hurdle he had made up the stagger on Kriss Akabusi to his outside. Relative to the hurdles, he had clearly passed Graham with the rest of the field clearly a full stride or more behind. Running 13 strides the rest of the way, he passed the rest of the competitors to his outside between the next two hurdles. A one stride lead over Graham at the eight hurdle became two by the ninth. Young was still powerful as Graham was struggling. Young tried to maintain that power into the final hurdle though he came up a little short, catching the face of the hurdle with his lead leg heel, riding the hurdle to the ground. He maintained his powerful stride to the finish. Realizing he had the clear victory, he raised his right arm in celebration 10 meters before the finish, slowing his last four strides.

Still, Young won with a new world record of 46.78. He was the first person to have run 400 m hurdles in less than 47 seconds. The world record was unbeaten for nearly 30 years until Karsten Warholm ran 46.70 in Oslo, on 1 July 2021.

Young became the first ever ESPY award winner in track presented by ESPN.

It is well noted that Young, throughout the 1992 season prior to Barcelona, placed small pieces of paper with the numbers 46.89 in each running spike. He had mentally convinced himself that running under 47 seconds was possible.

In 1993, Young won his second US National Championships title and had 25 consecutive wins until he was beaten by Samuel Matete from Zambia just two weeks before the 1993 World Championships. In the World Championships final, however, Young again made a decisive move between hurdles 7 and 8. He held this lead until the finish, beating Matete by 0.42 seconds.

===Later career===
After 1993, Young&#x27;s performances on the track declined for a number of reasons. Young left from his training base in California and departed from his former coach John Smith. He raced at just two meetings in 1994: he took second at the New York Games with a season&#x27;s best of 49.70 seconds but failed to make the 400 m hurdles final at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. He finished the season after the championships. There he focused on working within the Atlanta community doing appearances at many local Atlanta Boys and Girls Clubs, appearing at toy drives for homeless shelter families. Still nursing a nagging knee injury, Young looked forward to a meaningful 1995 season practicing at Life College. Unable to manage with a meniscus tear on his lead leg, the injury compromised his season requiring surgery two days after his birthday. With help from coach Bobby Kersee, Young was eager to get ready for the Atlanta trials, only to advance as far as the semis, placing fifth in his heat. Years after the 1996 trials Young embraced many opportunities to run overseas throughout Europe and in Israel. While racing in Greece in 1998, Young become a member of the Panhellinos Gymnastics Club. Minos Kiriakou, a local media tycoon welcomed their new club athlete. At the 1998 European &quot;Group B&quot; Champions Cup, Young won the 400m hurdles event setting then a club record. Never &quot;officially&quot; retiring, Young simply marveled in the exploits of the newer talented group of hurdlers respecting their feats and his own achievements. He was inducted into the United States Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Personal life==
Young is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

Young is an artist with work on display through the Art of the Olympians.

In December 2019 Young, while a student at Swansea University, was involved in a road traffic crash in which he was the passenger on a double-decker bus that collided with a railway bridge on Neath Road in Swansea, South Wales. Young suffered a head injury and two broken ribs. One of eight people hurt, he tried to pull the windscreen off a woman passenger who remained conscious but later died.

<doc id="979263" wikidata="Q1278183" url="?curid=979263" title="Eastern Highlands">
<text>:&quot;&quot;Eastern Highlands&quot; also refers to Eastern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea, and part of the Great Dividing Range, Australia.&quot;


The Eastern Highlands, also known as the Manica Highlands, is a mountain range on the border of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about through Zimbabwe&#x27;s Manicaland Province and Mozambique&#x27;s Manica Province.

The Highlands are home to the Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic ecoregion. The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, Chimanimani Mountains, Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated Mount Gorongosa further east in Mozambique. The Southern miombo woodlands ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.

The highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and heathlands.

==Geography==
The highlands consist of three main mountain groups – the Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains – and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.

The Nyanga Mountains in the north contain Zimbabwe&#x27;s highest mountain Mount Nyangani (2,592 m), and Mutarazi Falls, Africa&#x27;s second-longest waterfall. The Choa Mountains rise northeast of the Nyanga mountains in Mozambique. Zimbabwe&#x27;s agricultural Honde Valley lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.

Mutare is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the A3 (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of Beira in Mozambique to Zimbabwe&#x27;s capital Harare via Chimoio, Manica, and Mutare, with a border crossing at Machipanda. The Beira–Bulawayo railway also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.

The Bvumba Mountains are centrally situated south of Mutare. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural Burma Valley lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains.

South of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.

The Chimanimani Mountains lie south of the Mussapa Pequeno River, which divides them from the Tandara plateau. The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. Monte Binga on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the highlands for centuries.

The Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into Chipinge District, and the highest point is Mount Selinda at 1230 meters.

The Eastern Highlands are part of the East African Highlands, one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the East African Rift and Abyssinian physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down East Africa. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as Afromontane flora and fauna.

==Climate==
The Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe&#x27;s central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the Indian Ocean. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the Zambezi River, while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the Save River. The eastern slope is drained by Mozambique&#x27;s Buzi and Pungwe rivers.

==Flora==
Much of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, &quot;Themeda triandra&quot; is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and &quot;Loudetia simplex&quot; is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including &quot;Loudetia simplex, Trachypogon spicatus, Exotheca abyssinica,&quot; and &quot;Monocymbium ceresiiforme&quot;.

Some valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of subtropical rainforest, with a high canopy, lianas, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of miombo woodland &quot;(Brachystegia spiciformis&quot;, &quot;Brachystegia tamarindoides&quot; and &quot;Uapaca kirkiana&quot;) and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall, evergreen mobola plum &quot;Parinari curatellifolia&quot; near the town of Chipinge and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.

In the Chimanimani Mountains and Mount Gorongosa, heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from quartzite. The heathlands are of two types, ericaceous and proteaceous. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by &quot;Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,&quot; and &quot;E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii&quot;, and &quot;Leucospermum saxosum&quot; are common in the proteaceous heathlands.

A number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. &quot;Cryptostephanotis vansonii&quot;, &quot;Cyrtanthus rhodesianus&quot;, and &quot;Scadoxus pole-evansi&quot; are popular with rare plant collectors.

==Fauna==

This variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include Sykes&#x27; monkey (&quot;Cercopithecus albogularis&quot;), East African little collared fruit bat (&quot;Myonycteris relicta&quot;) and Marshall&#x27;s pygmy chameleon (&quot;Rhampholeon marshalli&quot;). Many of its animals are found throughout East Africa.

The highlands are also rich in birdlife including trumpeter hornbill (&quot;Bycanistes bucinator&quot;), Livingstone&#x27;s turaco (&quot;Tauraco livingstonii&quot;), purple-crested turaco (&quot;Tauraco porphyreolophus&quot;), crested guineafowl (&quot;Guttera pucherani&quot;) and crowned eagle (&quot;Stephanoaetus coronatus&quot;). Two species, the Chirinda apalis (&quot;Apalis chirindensis&quot;) and Roberts&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Oreophilais robertsi&quot;), are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts&#x27;s warbler inhabits the forest edge.

The forests are also full of butterflies, most notably swallowtails such as the emperor swallowtail (&quot;Papilio ophidicephalus&quot;) and the citrus swallowtail (&quot;Papilio demodocus&quot;) and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including skinks, geckos, lizards, frogs, toads, and snakes.
==Freshwater==
Numerous streams have their headwaters in the Eastern Highlands. Over time streams have deeply dissected the highlands, forming deep ravines and gorges. Some eastward-flowing streams form high waterfalls as they descend the escarpment into Mozambique.

The highlands&#x27; cool, high-altitude, rapidly-flowing streams create aquatic habitats distinct from the surrounding lowlands, and the highlands are home to several endemic species. Four species of fish – &quot;Labeo baldasseronii, Amarginops hildae, Varicorhinus pungweensis&quot;, and &quot;Parakneria mossambica&quot; – are endemic to the highlands.

==Threats and preservation==

The mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming.

Large areas of the highlands are protected, including Nyanga National Park in the Nyanga Mountains, Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe&#x27;s 171 km2 Chimanimani National Park and Mozambique&#x27;s Chimanimani National Reserve in the Chimanimani Mountains. The Chimanimani park and reserve together form the core of the Chimanimani Transfrontier Conservation Area.

<text>The Herero () are a Bantu ethnic group inhabiting parts of Southern Africa. 178,987 Namibians identified as Ovaherero in the 2023 census. They speak Otjiherero, a Bantu language. Though the Herero primarily reside in Namibia, there are also significant populations in Botswana and Angola, and a small number in South Africa. The Hereros in Botswana and South Africa are there because of displacement during the 1904 - 1908 genocide committed by the German Empire.

==Overview==

Unlike most Bantu, who are primarily subsistence farmers, the Herero are traditionally pastoralists. They make a living tending livestock. Cattle terminology in use among many Bantu pastoralist groups testifies that Bantu herders originally acquired cattle from Cushitic pastoralists inhabiting Eastern Africa. After the Bantu settled in Eastern Africa, some Bantu nations spread south. Linguistic evidence also suggests that the Bantu borrowed the custom of milking cattle from Cushitic peoples; either through direct contact with them or indirectly via Khoisan intermediaries who had acquired both domesticated animals and pastoral techniques from Cushitic migrants.

Though the Herero primarily reside in Namibia, there are also significant populations in Botswana and Angola. In Botswana, the Hereros or Ovaherero are mostly found in Maun and some villages surrounding Maun. These villages among others are Sepopa, Toromuja, Karee and Etsha. Some of them are at Mahalapye. In the South eastern part of Botswana they are at Pilane. There are also a few of them in the Kgalagadi South, that is Tsabong, Omawaneni, Draaihoek and Makopong Villages.

===Organization===
The Herero claim to comprise several sub-divisions, including the Himba, Tjimba (Cimba), Mbanderu, and Kwandu. Groups in Angola include the Mucubal OvaKuvale, Zemba, OvaHakawona, OvaTjavikwa, OvaTjimba and OvaHimba, who regularly cross the Namibia/Angola border when migrating with their herds. However, the OvaTjimba, though they speak Herero, are physically distinct indigenous hunter-gatherers. It may be in the Hereros&#x27; interest to portray indigenous peoples as impoverished Herero who do not own livestock.

The leadership of the Ovaherero is distributed over several heads of clans of which some are more prominent and referred as royal houses, among them:
* Ovaherero Traditional Authority, of the Ovaherero central governance system established in 1863, chief Mutjinde Katjiua
* Maharero Royal Traditional Authority, chief Tjinaani Maharero
* Zeraeua Royal Traditional Authority at Omarurur
* Ovambanderu Royal Traditional Authority, chief Eben Nguvauva
* &quot;Onguatjindu&quot; Royal Traditional Authority at Okakarara, chief Sam Kambazembi
Since conflicts with the Nama people in the 1860s necessitated Ovaherero unity, they also have a paramount chief ruling over all clans of Ovaherero, although there is currently an interpretation that such paramount chieftaincy violates the Traditional Authorities Act, Act 25 of 2000.

===Paramount Chiefs===
The highest office is that of the &quot;Paramount Chief&quot;, the leader of all Herero people. The position and in dispute, and so far, no formal gazetting has been done by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. Potential candidates are Prof Mutjinde Katjiua (elected in March 2021 by the Ovaherero Traditional Authority, OTA) and Dr Hoze Riruako (elected by &quot;a splinter group within the OTA&quot; on 5 February 2023). Meanwhile, Chief Vipuira Kapuuo from Ovitoto is acting in the position since Rukoro&#x27;s death.

The genealogy of the Paramount Chiefs of the Herero is:
* Vekuii Rukoro (2014-2021) In June 2014, when Riruako died, the chairman of the Chiefs Council, Tumbee Tjombe, who was deputized by Vipuira Kapuuo, became the acting Paramount Chief. In July of the same year, Tjombe also died, and a senior traditional councilor, Tjipene Keja, was elected in August 2014 by the Chief&#x27;s Council to serve as the acting Paramount Chief. Acting Paramount Chief Keja convened a senate meeting in September 2014 at Ehungiro, to elect the substantive Paramount Chief, and Advocate Vekuii Rukoro emerged as the sole candidate.
* Kuaima Riruako (1978–2014) In March 1978, after the assassination of Kapuuo, the chairperson of the Chiefs&#x27; Council, Senior Headman Gerson Hoveka became the acting Paramount Chief. A senate meeting was convened in the same year where Kuaima Riruako was elected, as the substantive Paramount Chief.
* Clemens Kapuuo (1970–1978) Due to the advanced age of Kutako, in 1960 Clemence Kapuuo, who was the secretary of the Chiefs Council, was elected as deputy Paramount Chief to take the mantle in the eventuality that Kutako passes on. In 1970, two days following Kutako&#x27;s death, Kapuuo assumed the position of a substantive Paramount Chief.
* Hosea Kutako (1917–1970) Following the Herero Wars from 1904 to 1908, Paramount Chief Samuel Maharero fled to Bechuanaland (now Botswana). This created a leadership vacuum amongst the Ovaherero, more so when the Ovaherero were incarcerated into the concentration camps. When the Ovaherero were released from the concentration camps in 1915, an election was held in 1916/17 among the clan leaders and their councillors to choose between two candidates, Hosea Kutako and Kaevaka Kamaheke, for the position of Acting Paramount Chief. Hosea Kutako emerged victorious, and was later confirmed as Paramount Chief in 1920.
* Samuel Maharero (1890–1917) When Paramount Chief Maharero died in 1890, his son Samuel Maharero assumed the position in 1892 with the aid of the German Administrative Governor Theodor Leutwein.
* Maharero ka Tjamuaha (1861–1890) With Tjamuaha death in 1861, hostilities started between the Nama people and the Herero. This made it necessary for the clans to unite as a group. That is how, on 15 June 1863 at Otjizingue (now Otjimbingwe), Maharero was elected as the commander-in-chief of all Herero clans. Later Maharero was elected the first Paramount Chief of the Herero people.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===
In the 15th century, the Herero migrated to what is now Namibia from the east and established themselves as herdsmen. In the beginning of the 19th century, the Nama from South Africa, who already possessed some firearms, entered the land and were followed, in turn, by white merchants and German missionaries. At first, the Nama began displacing the Herero, leading to bitter warfare between the two groups, which lasted the greater part of the 19th century. Later the two peoples entered into a period of cultural exchange.

===German South West Africa===

During the late 18th century, the first Europeans began entering to permanently settle the land. Primarily in Damaraland, German settlers acquired land from the Herero in order to establish farms. In 1883, the merchant Franz Adolf Eduard Lüderitz entered into a contract with the native elders. The exchange later became the basis of German colonial rule. The territory became a German colony under the name of German South West Africa.

Soon after, conflicts between the German colonists and the Herero herdsmen began. Controversies frequently arose because of disputes about access to land and water, but also the legal discrimination against the native population by the white immigrants.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, imperialism and colonialism in Africa peaked, affecting especially the Hereros and the Namas. European powers were seeking trade routes and railways, as well as more colonies. Germany officially claimed their stake in a South African colony in 1884, calling it German South West Africa until it was taken over in 1915. The first German colonists arrived in 1892, and conflict with the indigenous Herero and Nama people began. As in many cases of colonization, the indigenous people were not treated fairly.

Between 1893 and 1903, the Herero and Nama peoples&#x27; land and cattle were progressively being taken by German colonial settlers. The Herero and Nama resisted expropriation over the years. In 1903, the Herero people learnt that they were to be placed in reservations, leaving more room for colonialists to own land and prosper. The Herero, 1904, and Nama, 1905, began a great rebellion that lasted until 1907, ending with the near destruction of the Herero people. &quot;The war against the Herero and Nama was the first in which German imperialism resorted to methods of genocide...&quot; Roughly 80,000 Herero lived in German South West Africa at the beginning of Germany&#x27;s colonial rule over the area, while after their revolt was defeated, they numbered approximately 15,000. In a period of four years, approximately 65,000 Herero people were killed.

Samuel Maharero, the Paramount Chief of the Herero, led his people in a large-scale uprising on January 12, 1904, against the Germans. The Herero, surprising the Germans with their uprising, had initial success.

German General Lothar von Trotha took over as leader in May 1904. In August 1904, he devised a plan to annihilate the Herero nation. The plan was to surround the area where the Herero were, leaving but one route for them to escape, into the desert. The Herero battled the Germans, and the losses were minor. It was when the majority had escaped through the only passage made available by the Germans, and had been systematically prevented from approaching watering holes, that starvation began to take its toll. It was then that the Herero uprising changed from war, to genocide. Lothar von Trotha called the conflict a &quot;race war&quot;. He declared in the German press that &quot;no war may be conducted humanely against non-humans&quot; and issued an &quot;annihilation order&quot;:
&quot;... The Herero are no longer German subjects. They have murdered and stolen, they have cut off the ears, noses, and other body parts of wounded soldiers, now out of cowardice they no longer want to fight. I tell the people: Anyone who delivers one captain will receive 1,000 marks, whoever delivers Samuel Maharero will receive 5,000 marks. The Herero people must, however, leave the land. If the populace does not do this, I will force them with the &quot;Groot Rohr&quot; [cannon]. Within the German borders every Herero, with or without a gun, with or without cattle, will be shot. I will no longer accept women and children, I will drive them back to their people or I will have them shot at.&quot;

On the 100th anniversary of the genocide, German Minister for Economic Development and Cooperation Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul commemorated the dead on site and apologised for the crimes on behalf of all Germans. Hereros and Namas demanded financial reparations; however, in 2004 there was only minor media attention in Germany on this matter.

==Culture==
The Herero are traditionally cattle-herding pastoralists, thus cattle is the mainstay of their economy. Historically cattle raids occurred between Herero clans, but Hereroland (Ehi rOvaherero) belongs to all the Ovaherero and has no fixed boundaries.

The Herero have a double descent system. A person traces their heritage through their mother&#x27;s lineage, or (plural: ), and one gains clan leadership from their father&#x27;s lineage, or (plural: ). In the 1920s, Kurt Falk recorded in the &quot;Archiv für Menschenkunde&quot; that the Ovahimba retained a &quot;medicine-man&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot;. He wrote, &quot;When I asked him if he was married, he winked at me slyly and the other natives laughed heartily and declared to me subsequently that he does not love women, but only men. He nonetheless enjoyed no low status in his tribe.&quot;
The Holy Fire okuruuo (&quot;OtjikaTjamuaha&quot;) of the Herero is located at Okahandja. During immigration, the fire was doused and quickly relit. From 1923 to 2011, it was situated at the &quot;Red Flag Commando&quot;. On Herero Day 2011, a group around Paramount Chief Kuaima Riruako claimed that this fire was facing eastwards for the past 88 years, while it should be facing towards the sunset. They removed it and placed it at an undisclosed location, a move that has stirred controversy among the Ovaherero community.

===Dress===

Despite sharing a language and pastoral traditions, the Herero are not a homogeneous people. Traditional leather garments are worn by northwestern groups, such as the Himba, Kuvale, and Tjimba, who also conserve pre-colonial traditions in other aspects: for example, they do not buy bedding, but rather sleep in bedding made of cow skin. The Kaokoland Herero and those in Angola have remained isolated and are still pastoral nomads, practicing limited horticulture.

However, the main Herero group in central Namibia (sometimes called Herero proper) was heavily influenced by Western culture during the colonial period, creating a whole new identity. The missionaries considered the shape of the traditional headdress &quot;Ekori&quot;, which symbolized the horns of cows (the main source of wealth of the people), as a symbol of the devil and rejected it. The dress of the Herero proper, and their southern counterparts the Mbanderu, incorporates and appropriates the styles of clothing worn by their German colonizers. Though the attire was initially forced upon the Herero, it now operates as a new tradition and a point of pride.

During the 1904-07 war, Herero warriors would steal and wear the uniforms of German soldiers they had killed, believing that this transferred the dead soldiers&#x27; power to them. Today, on ceremonial occasions, Herero men wear military-style garb, including peaked caps, berets, epaulettes, aiguillettes and gaiters, &quot;to honour the fallen ancestors and to keep the memories alive.&quot;

Herero women adopted the floor-length gowns worn by German missionaries in the late 19th century, but now make them in vivid colors and prints. Married and older Herero women wear the dresses, locally known as &quot;ohorokova&quot;, every day, while younger and unmarried women wear them mainly for special occasions. Ohorokova dresses are high-necked and have voluminous skirts lavishly gathered from a high waist or below the bust, incorporating multiple petticoats and up to ten metres of fabric. The long sleeves display sculptural volume: puffed from the shoulders or frilled at the wrists. Coordinating neckerchiefs are knotted around the neck. For everyday wear, dresses are ingeniously patchworked together from smaller pieces of fabric, which may be salvaged from older garments. Dresses made from a single material are reserved for special occasions.

The most distinctive feature of Herero women&#x27;s dress is their horizontal horned headdress, the &quot;otjikaiva&quot;, which is a symbol of respect, worn to pay homage to the cows that have historically sustained the Herero. The headdresses can be formed from rolled-up newspaper covered in fabric. They are made to match or coordinate with dresses, and decorative brooches and pins attached to the centre front.
This dress style continues to evolve. In urban Windhoek, fashion designers and models are updating Herero dress for modern, younger wearers, including glamorous sheer and embellished fabrics. &quot;Change is difficult, I understand, but people need to get used to the change,&quot; says designer McBright Kavari. &quot;I&#x27;m happy to be a part of the change, to be winning souls of people and making people happy when they are wearing the Herero dress.&quot; Kavari has won the Best Herero Dress competition three times in a row, but has been criticised for raising the hem of the garment to the knee.

===Language===

The Herero language (Otjiherero) is the main unifying link among the Herero peoples. It is a Bantu language, part of the Niger–Congo family. Within the Otjiherero umbrella, there are many dialects, including Oluthimba or Otjizemba—which is the most common dialect in Angola—Otjihimba, and Otjikuvale. These differ mainly in phonology, and are largely mutually intelligible, though Kuvale, Zemba, and Hakaona have been classified as separate languages. Standard Herero is used in the Namibian media and is taught in schools throughout the country.

==Religion==
Herero people believe in Okuruuo (holy fire), which is a link to their ancestors to speak to Ndjambi on their behalf. Modern-day Herero are mostly Christians, primarily Catholic, Lutheran, and Born-again Christian.

==Domestic animals==
The Herero make a living out of rearing domestic animals.

===Cattle===

Cattle are the most valued domestic animals in the Herero culture, therefore cattle herding is the most significant and substantial activity for the Herero people. In the Herero culture the cattle herding and cattle trading activities are only conducted by males while females are responsible for milking cows, household chores, harvesting small field crops and taking care of the young children. As women are responsible for milking cows, they are also responsible for preparing the delicious sour milk called &quot;Omaere&quot;. Although males are responsible for the cattle trading activities the females do most of the trading such as bartering for other goods.

====Cultural impact====
The Herero people take pride in their cattle, hence the culture of Herero requires women to wear their iconic fabric hats shaped like cow horns. They believe that the more cattle one has, the richer one is, making cattle a symbol of wealth. In celebrations such as marriages, cattle is normally eaten, whereas religious or ancestral veneration ceremonies involve the sacrifice of cows or other animals.

===Goats and sheep===
Goats and sheep are kept for their meat and milk. Goatskin is manufactured into child carriers and to create household ornaments. Goat dung, meanwhile, is considered medicinal; it is normally used to treat chickenpox.

===Horses and donkeys===
Horse and donkeys are common means of transport for the Herero. In cases of herding or searching for lost domestic animals, the Herero engage horses to carry out these activities.

Some Herero people are believed to consume donkey meat.

===Dogs and chickens===
In the Herero culture, dogs are used by men for both hunting and herding. The Herero people used to hunt to acquire meat, hide, and horns that are bartered for goods such as sugar, tea, and tobacco.

==Herero in fiction==

* A group of Herero living in Germany who were inducted into the German military during the Second World War play a major part in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. The genocide under von Trotha plays a major role in another novel by the same author, &quot;V.&quot;.
* German author Uwe Timm&#x27;s novel &quot;Morenga&quot;, set in German southwest Africa, includes several Herero characters.
* A Portuguese-Herero &quot;mestiço&quot; protagonist is featured in Guy Saville&#x27;s novel &quot;The Afrika Reich&quot;. The fictional story takes place in a 1952 Africa largely conquered by the Nazis who came away from World War II politically and economically empowered and relatively unopposed.
* In the historical novel &quot;Mama Namibia&quot; by Mari Serebrov, two perspectives of the 1904 genocide in German Southwest Africa are shown. The first is that of Jahohora, a 12-year-old Herero girl who survives alone in the veld for two years after her family is killed by German soldiers. The second is that of Kov, a Jewish doctor who volunteered to serve in the German military to prove his patriotism. As he witnesses the atrocities of the genocide, he rethinks his loyalty to the Fatherland.
* The Treatment of the Herero by German colonists is the subject of the 2012 play &quot;We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1884–1915&quot; by Jackie Sibblies Drury.

<doc id="979272" wikidata="Q284549" url="?curid=979272" title="Sodium metabisulfite">
<text>Sodium metabisulfite or sodium pyrosulfite (IUPAC spelling; Br. E. sodium metabisulphite or sodium pyrosulphite) is an inorganic compound of chemical formula Na2S2O5. The substance is sometimes referred to as disodium metabisulfite. It is used as a disinfectant, antioxidant, and preservative agent. When dissolved in water it forms sodium bisulfite.

==Preparation==

Sodium metabisulfite can be prepared by treating a solution of sodium hydroxide with sulfur dioxide. When conducted in warm water, Na2SO3 initially precipitates as a yellow solid. With more SO2, the solid dissolves to give the disulfite, which crystallises upon cooling. 
:SO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO3 + H2O
:SO2 + Na2SO3 → Na2S2O5
which yields a residue of colourless solid Na2S2O5.

==Chemical structure==
The anion metabisulfite consists of an SO2 group linked to an SO3 group, with the negative charge more localised on the SO3 end. The S–S bond length is 2.22 Å, and the &quot;thionate&quot; and &quot;thionite&quot; S–O distances are 1.46 and 1.50 Å, respectively.

==Reactivity==

Upon dissolution in water, bisulfite is generated:
:Na2S2O5 + H2O → 2 Na+ + 2 HSO3−

== Uses ==
Sodium and potassium metabisulfite have many major and niche uses. It is widely used for preserving food and beverages.
*Sodium metabisulfite is added as an excipient to medications which contain adrenaline (epinephrine), in order to prevent the oxidation of adrenaline. For example, it is added to combination drug formulations which contain a local anaesthetic and adrenaline, and to the formulation in epinephrine autoinjectors, such as the EpiPen. This lengthens the shelf life of the formulation, although the sodium metabisulfite reacts with adrenaline, causing it to degrade and form epinephrine sulfonate.
*In combination with sodium hydrosulfite it is used as a rust-stain remover
*It is used in photography.
*Concentrated sodium metabisulfite can be used to remove tree stumps. Some brands contain 98% sodium metabisulfite, and cause degradation of lignin in the stumps, facilitating removal.
*It is also used as an excipient in some tablets, such as paracetamol. 
*A very important health related aspect of this substance is that it can be added to a blood smear in a test for sickle cell anaemia (and other similar forms of haemoglobin mutation). The substance causes defunct cells to sickle (through a complex polymerisation) hence confirming disease.
*It is used as a bleaching agent in the production of coconut cream.
*It (or liquid SO2) is commonly used as an antimicrobial and antioxidant in winemaking; bottled wine indicates its use with the label &quot;Contains Sulfites&quot; in the US.
*It is used as a reducing agent to break sulfide bonds in shrunken items of clothing made of natural fibres, thus allowing the garment to go back to its original shape after washing.
*It is used as an SO2 source (mixed with air or oxygen) for the destruction of cyanide in commercial gold cyanidation processes.
*It is used as an SO2 source (mixed with air or oxygen) for the precipitation of elemental gold in chloroauric (aqua regia) solutions.
*It is used in the water treatment industry to quench residual chlorine.
*It is used in tint etching iron-based metal samples for microstructural analysis.
*It is used as a fungicide for anti-microbe and mould prevention during shipping of consumer goods such as shoes and clothing. Plastic stickers and packaging (such as Micro-Pak™) containing the anhydrous, sodium metabisulfite solid active ingredient are added prior to shipping. The devices absorb moisture from the atmosphere during shipping and release low levels of sulfur dioxide.
*It is used for preserving fruit during shipping.
*It is used as a solvent in the extraction of starch from tubers, fruit, and cereal crops.
*It is used as a pickling agent to treat high pressure reverse osmosis and nanofiltration water desalination membranes for extended storage periods between uses.
*It is used to create a bisulfite adduct from ketones to aid in separation of the ketone product. The usage of metabisulfite versus the sulfite is also more entropically favourable.

== Safety ==
Sodium metabisulfite, despite not being flammable, decomposes in 150 °C of heat releasing toxic gasses when decomposed. It is corrosive when dissolved in water. Some people who are sulfite sensitive may experience an allergic reaction to sodium meta bisulfite, sometimes severe, resulting in labeling requirements for food safety. In 2024, it was named ‘allergen of the year 2024’ by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.

Wieczorek-Zeul (pronounced &quot;VEE‐choreck TSOIL&quot;) began her career as a teacher 1965–1974 at Friedrich Ebert School and 1977–1978 at Georg Büchner School in Rüsselsheim am Main, and subsequently served as Chairwoman of the European Coordination Bureau of International Youth Organizations from 1977 to 1979.

==Political career==

===Early beginnings===
Wieczorek-Zeul is a prominent figure of the Social Democrats&#x27; left wing and is often called &quot;Red Heidi&quot;. From 1974 to 1977, she was the first woman to chair the Jusos (Young Socialists), the youth organisation of the SPD. In this capacity, she represented the party&#x27;s then 350,000 members who were under 35. During her time as Juso chief, she drew headlines in 1975 by calling for limit of $2,000 a month on personal income.

From 1977 to 1979, she was President of the European Coordination Bureau of International Youth Organisation (a precursor to the modern European Youth Forum).

===Member of the European Parliament, 1979–1987===
Wieczorek-Zeul was elected Member of the European Parliament in the 1979 European elections, the first European elections to be held and also the first international election in history. During her time in Parliament, she was part of the Socialist Group.

Between 1979 and 1984, Wieczorek-Zeul served as vice-chairwoman of the Committee on External Economic Relations. From 1984 to 1987, she was a member of the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights. In addition to her committee assignments, she was a member of the Parliament’s delegation for relations with the Gulf States.

===Member of the German Bundestag, 1987–2013===
Wieczorek-Zeul first became a member of the Bundestag in the 1987 West German elections, where she joined the Committee on European Affairs. In this capacity, she served as the Social Democrat’s European policy spokeswoman.

After the resignation of party leader Björn Engholm in 1993, she stood for the Social Democrats&#x27; candidacy for the chancellor&#x27;s office, but lost to Rudolf Scharping. Scharping won 40% of all votes cast by the party members, Schröder 33% and Wieczorek-Zeul 27%. It was the first time the party members were asked to elect the new party leader directly. From 1993 to 2005, Wieczorek-Zeul served as deputy chairwoman of the SPD, under the leadership of successive chairmen Rudolf Scharping (1993–1995), Oskar Lafontaine (1995–1999), Gerhard Schröder (1999–2004) and Franz Müntefering (2004–2005).

From 2009 to 2013, Wieczorek-Zeul served on the Bundestag’s Committee on Foreign Affairs and as spokesperson of the SPD parliamentary group on the Subcommittee on the United Nations, International Organizations and Globalization.

===Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development, 1998–2009===

First term

When Gerhard Schröder (SPD) became Chancellor following the 1998 elections, Wieczorek-Zeul was appointed Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the time, her appointment was seen as underlining the importance attached to the issue by the Social Democrat/Green government.

In her capacity as minister, Wieczorek-Zeul served as Member of the Broadcasting Board of &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;; as Member of Board of Supervisory Directors of KfW; and as Member of the Board of Governors of the World Bank. She also participated in the preparations for the 25th G8 summit in 1999 and the 33rd G8 summit in 2007, both of which were hosted by Germany. In her first years in office, she worked merged the &#x27;Deutsche Stiftung für internationale Entwicklung (DSE)&#x27; and the &#x27;Carl-Duisberg-Gesellschaft (CDG)&#x27; to create InWEnt, an institution with worldwide operations in the field of bilateral development cooperation and international cooperation, with a focus on capacity building.

During a meeting at Utstein Abbey on the west coast of Norway in 1999, Wieczorek-Zeul co-founded (along with fellow development ministers Eveline Herfkens, Clare Short and Hilde Frafjord Johnson) the Utstein Group, a partnership of donor countries working to make the UN development system more effective.

In an effort to make it easier for antiwar critics to back Schröder’s decision to send German Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in 2001, Wieczorek-Zeul and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer announced a 256 million marks ($115 million) humanitarian-aid package for Afghan refugees. In October 2001, she joined Schröder on a state visit to Pakistan for meetings with President Pervez Musharraf, where they revived economic assistance to the country in return for its support for the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism and in light of incoming refugee flows from Afghanistan. In 2004, she co-hosted an international donors&#x27; conference on Afghanistan in Berlin, during which Afghanistan received more than $8 billion in pledges for the years 2005 to 2007. By 2007, she called extension for the international armed forces in the country.

In February 2003, Wieczorek-Zeul was one out of three cabinet members taking part in a march against the Iraq War in Berlin.

On 16 August 2004, at the 100th anniversary of the start of the Herero and Namaqua Genocide, Wieczorek-Zeul, on behalf of the German government, officially apologized for the first time and expressed grief about the genocide, declaring, &quot;We Germans accept our historic and moral responsibility and the guilt incurred by Germans at that time.&quot; In addition, she admitted that the massacres were equivalent to genocide. She ruled out paying special compensation, but promised continued economic aid for Namibia.

Wieczorek-Zeul represented the German government at the funeral services for former Prime Minister of Japan Keizō Obuchi on 8 June 2000 and (alongside Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer) for Prime Minister of Serbia Zoran Đinđić on 16 March 2003.

Second term

Wieczorek-Zeul kept her office after Schröder&#x27;s defeat in the 2005 elections and served in the first government Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2005 until 2009.

Wieczorek-Zeul initiated the EU&#x27;s target of increasing its official development assistance (ODA) from 0.51 percent by 2010 to 0.7 percent of the GDP by 2015. During her time in office, German ODA increased regularly and reached 13.9 billion US$ in disbursements in 2008, taking it to 0.38 percent of GNI.

In October 2007, Wieczorek-Zeul joined Merkel on her first official trip to Africa – including stops in Ethiopia, Liberia and South Africa –, during which they met with Nelson Mandela and Graça Machel, John Kufuor and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, among others. She also visited Kenya&#x27;s sprawling slum at Mathare 4A, Kasarani District and virtually pitied Mathare 4A primary school, which had been invaded and harassed by squatters. Today, the old school has been replaced by a new Heidemarie (formally, Mathare 4A) Primary School, courtesy of the German Government through KfW Entwicklungsbank and the government of Kenya.

On 26 January 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul and Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel chaired the conference which led to the founding of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Under her leadership, Germany joined Austria and Switzerland in July 2009 in canceling €450 million ($630 million) in state export-loan guarantees for Turkey’s Ilısu Dam because Turkish plans to resettle towns and safeguard cultural treasures were not sufficient to meet World Bank standards.

Wieczorek-Zeul also served on the Executive Board of the Socialist International (SI).

Role in international organizations

After Merkel formally launched the World Bank Group’s three-year Gender Action Plan in February 2007, Wieczorek-Zeul served as honorary co-chair (alongside Danny Leipziger) of the High Level Advisory Council on Women&#x27;s Economic Empowerment and as Official Champion of the World Bank Group Gender Action Plan. Amid a 2007 leadership crisis at the Bank, Wieczorek-Zeul was a leading figure in the downfall of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the organization. At the time, Germany’s role was central partly because it held the EU presidency and also chaired the bank’s 24-nation Executive Board. Wolfowitz was later replaced by Robert Zoellick.

Alongside Chancellor Merkel, Wieczorek-Zeul co-hosted the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria replenishment conference in Berlin in September 2007. During the conference, donor countries promised nearly $10 billion to the Fund for 2008–2010.

In 2008, Wieczorek-Zeul served as Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the International Conference on Financing for Development in Doha, Qatar. Between 2008 and 2009, she was part of a High-Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, which had been launched to help strengthen health systems in the 49 poorest countries in the world and was chaired by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Robert Zoellick.

Also between 2008 and 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul served as member of the Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, which was chaired by author and Nobel Laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz. The commission had the aim of proposing necessary reforms in the world financial system that would prevent another event like the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

==Political positions==

===Global health===
In 2001, Wieczorek-Zeul called for 39 pharmaceutical firms – including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and Boehringer Ingelheim – to abandon their legal challenge to a South African law designed to lower the price of patent-protected HIV and AIDS medicines.

In March 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul criticized statements made by Pope Benedict XVI which claimed that condoms promote AIDS. when in fact they help prevent AIDS. In a joint statement with Health Minister Ulla Schmidt, she criticized the pope&#x27;s remarks and underlined the importance of condom use in developing nations.

In September 2009, Wieczorek-Zeul announced the German government’s pledge of an additional $130 million (€100 million) to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) for 2009 to 2013.

===Relations with Israel===
In 2006, Wieczorek-Zeul voiced criticism against Israel&#x27;s attacks on civilian infrastructure in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, calling it &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; In response, Charlotte Knobloch, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, demanded her resignation.

===Relations with Tibet===
In May 2008, Wieczorek-Zeul was the only minister of Chancellor Merkel’s government who agreed to meet with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, during a five-day visit to Germany. This was against the wishes of Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the leader of the Social Democrats, Kurt Beck, who had both said that no senior party leaders would meet with him. The visit took place eight months after a historic meeting between the Dalai Lama and Merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between China and Germany.

<doc id="979276" wikidata="Q528347" url="?curid=979276" title="Johnny Moss">
<text>Johnny Moss (May 14, 1907 – December 16, 1995) was a gambler and professional poker player. He was the first winner of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, at the time a cash game event in which he was awarded the title by the vote of his peers in 1970. He also twice won the current tournament format of the WSOP Main Event in 1971 and 1974. He was one of the charter inductees into the Poker Hall of Fame in 1979.

==Early years==
Moss was born on May 14, 1907, in Marshall, Texas and grew up in Dallas, Texas, which was where he learned how to gamble as a young boy. A group of cheaters taught him how to cheat in games, but Moss put this knowledge to good use. As a teenager, he was hired by a local saloon to watch over games and make sure they were played fairly. While he was keeping games safe from cheaters, he was learning the strategy behind playing poker.

==Gambling career==

Two years later, Moss became a rounder and traveled the country looking for gambling action. In the 1950s, Moss moved to Odessa, Texas to be a part of the oil boom and gambling action. Moss and his fellow gamblers were part of one of the biggest poker games in Texas for many years.

===Heads-up marathon with Nick The Greek===
In 1949, Moss played with Nick the Greek in a five-month-long &quot;heads up&quot; poker marathon set up by mob boss Benny Binion, winning between $2 and $4 million. At the conclusion of the game, Nick the Greek uttered what has become one of the most famous poker quotes ever: &quot;Mr. Moss, I have to let you go.&quot; This game is often cited as the inspiration behind the WSOP. This game became the foundation for Al Alvarez&#x27;s book &quot;The Biggest Game in Town&quot; and is one of the best known stories in poker. Despite being one of the best-known poker stories, claims have been made that the game never took place. According to author Steve Fischer, there were no stories or reports of this tournament until six years after Nick&#x27;s death. Binion never spoke of the game even when providing a detailed history of Las Vegas and avoided answering questions about the game by saying, &quot;Well, my memory ain&#x27;t what it used to be.&quot; While Nick the Greek was often covered by the national media, there are no news reports in any local or national source. Fischer says that nearly every version of the story is virtually identical to the version first told by Moss beginning &quot;circa&quot; 1971. The story is consistently said to have taken place in 1949 at the Horseshoe Casino, a casino that did not exist for another year and a half. Fischer also points out that during the time that Binion supposedly set up the game, he was fighting off a request from Texas to have him extradited. Because of his past, Binion lost his license to run a gambling establishment in 1948 and did not regain it until April 13, 1950. He was not granted a license to open the Horseshoe Casino until December 5, 1952. Fischer believes that the notion of Binion sponsoring a poker game, in front of a window, of a casino that had not opened, while fighting extradition is &quot;absurd.&quot;

In reaction to a 2017 pokernews.com article on the topic, Jack Binion, at the time 80 years old, attempted to clarify. To address the heart of the matter first, Binion explained that Johnny Moss and Nick Dandolos &quot;did&quot; play a poker match in 1949, although it was not at the Horseshoe at all. Nor was it the months-long spectacle open to spectators many have suggested the match to have been.

&quot;It took place at the Flamingo,&quot; Binion explained. Also, it was &quot;not in public.&quot; This, he noted, was a quote from Dandolos himself.

Meanwhile, a few years later there was another poker game involving Moss, this time at the Horseshoe.

&quot;There was a big game at the Horseshoe in the early &#x27;50s,&quot; Binion explained, &quot;but Nick didn&#x27;t participate.&quot; The game featured &quot;multiple players&quot; including Moss, who came and went as the game continued around the clock. Unlike the game at the Flamingo in 1949, the later one &quot;was held in public.&quot;

The confusion, Binion surmised, likely stemmed from Moss having participated in both games. However, there was never one between him and Dandolos at the Horseshoe, and the pair never did have a high-stakes heads-up battle in public. Binion also clarified that the inspiration for the WSOP was the previously held Texas Gamblers Reunion and not any Moss/Dandolos match.

===World Series of Poker===

Moss won the 1970, 1971, and 1974 World Series of Poker Main Events. For the 1970 Main Event, Moss was actually elected champion by his peers and received a silver cup as his prize. A (possibly apocryphal) story about that election which has appeared in print several times has every one of the seven players voting for himself as the best player, and that it was only when the players were asked to vote for the &quot;second&quot; best player that Moss emerged. He played at every WSOP from 1970 through 1995, and during his career, he won nine WSOP bracelets. Moss had at least a share of the lifetime WSOP bracelet lead up until the 2005 World Series of Poker, which is where Johnny Chan became the first player to win a tenth career bracelet.

==== World Series of Poker bracelets ====

*In 1970, Moss was voted champion by his peers and was awarded a silver cup.

**Moss set the record for the oldest bracelet winner in WSOP history, which still stands as of the end of the 2017 World Series of Poker.

==Personal life and legacy==
Moss&#x27;s wife was Virgie, who was from West Texas.

One of Moss&#x27;s strategies for tournament poker was survival in the early stages. As the tournament goes on and blinds increase, his strategy was to test opponents with aggression and bigger pots.

Moss outlined his strategies in a slim 1950 book, &quot;How to Win at Poker&quot; The publisher&#x27;s foreword demurs that there is any such person as &quot;John Moss,&quot; stating that the name hides the identity of &quot;a very astute midwest poker player.&quot; Further biographical details confirm that the author is indeed Moss.

Fellow professional Doyle Brunson put Moss on his Mount Rushmore of poker players, along with Puggy Pearson, Sailor Roberts, and Chip Reese.

An authorized autobiography on Moss, which is called &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;, was written by Don Jenkins.

<doc id="979287" wikidata="Q8146024" url="?curid=979287" title="Euromyth">
<text>A euromyth is an exaggerated or invented story about the European Union (EU) and the activities of its institutions, such as purportedly nonsensical EU legislation.

Conversely, the same term has been applied by Eurosceptics to purportedly misleading or exaggerated claims by the European Commission, and some assert that the term (in the former sense) is falsely applied to true stories.

Debate as to whether a particular claim is true sometimes continues long after the original story appeared. On occasions, Euromyths may arise when the actions of a different European organisation, such as the Council of Europe, are erroneously attributed to the EU.

In 2000, the British government announced a policy of publicly rebutting such myths and accused journalists of failing in their mission to inform.
Accusations of distorted or untruthful reporting are most commonly directed at conservative and Eurosceptic sections of the British media. Stories can present the European civil service as drafting rules that &quot;defy common sense&quot;. Examples cited as Euromyths include stories about rules banning mince pies, prawn cocktail crisps, curved bananas and mushy peas. Others include a story that English fish and chips shops would be forced to use Latin names for their fish (&quot;The Sun&quot;, 5 September 2001), quoted in that double-decker buses would be banned (&quot;The Times&quot;, 9 April 1998), that barmaids would have to cover up their cleavage.

In some cases, Euromyth stories have been traced to deliberate attempts by lobbyists to influence actions by the European bureaucracy, such as the level of customs duties for particular products. EU officials have also claimed that many such stories result from unclear or misunderstood information on complicated policies, and are claimed to have seized on minor errors in stories as evidence that they are entirely fictional.

==Examples==

===British sausage as an &quot;Emulsified High Fat Offal Tube&quot;===
A 1984 episode of the satirical television programme &quot;Yes Minister&quot; included a plotline in which the Commission would require the renaming of the British sausage as an &quot;emulsified high fat offal tube&quot; on account of it not containing enough meat. Although Jim Hacker, the government minister responsible for its implementation, managed to get British sausages exempt, he informed the press of the requirement in order to boost his standing in his party&#x27;s leadership contest. The &quot;eurosausage&quot; story is used as an amusing but fictional example of a Euromyth.

=== Straight bananas ===

The alleged ban on curved bananas is a long-standing, famous and stereotypical claim that is used in headlines to typify the Euromyth. With other issues of acceptable quality and standards, the regulation specifies minimum dimensions and states that bananas shall be free from deformation or abnormal curvature. The provisions relating to shape apply fully only to bananas sold as &quot;Extra&quot; class; slight defects of shape (but not size) are permitted in &quot;Class I&quot; and &quot;Class II&quot; bananas. A proposal banning straight bananas and other misshapen fruits was brought before the European Parliament in 2008 and defeated.

On 29 July 2008, the European Commission held a preliminary vote towards repealing certain regulations relating to other fruit and vegetables but not bananas. According to the Commission&#x27;s press release, &quot;In this era of high prices and growing demand, it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them [...] It shouldn&#x27;t be the EU&#x27;s job to regulate these things. It is far better to leave it to market operators&quot;. Some Eurosceptic sources have claimed this to be an admission that the original regulations did indeed ban undersized or misshapen fruit and vegetables.

On 25 March 2010, a BBC article stated that there were EU shape standardisation regulations in force on &quot;apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes and tomatoes&quot; and &quot;Marketing standards for 26 types of produce had been scrapped in November 2008, following information that a fifth of produce had been rejected by shops across the EU for failing to meet the requirements&quot;.

<doc id="979290" wikidata="Q170711" url="?curid=979290" title="Palapye">
<text>Palapye is a growing town in Botswana, situated about halfway between Francistown and Gaborone ( from Francistown and from Gaborone). Over the years its position has made it a convenient stopover on one of Southern Africa&#x27;s principal north–south rail and road routes.

Located here is the Morupule Colliery, which supplies Morupule Power Station, Botswana&#x27;s principal domestic source of electricity. The power station has undertaken an expansion project to increase its generation capacity in an effort to meet the country&#x27;s increasing demand for electricity. Construction began in 2010. , Morupule A plant produces 132 MW of electricity, while Morupule B produces 600 MW.

In 1997 Palapye was said to be the fastest-growing village in Africa, and was expected to expand its population from 30,000 to 180,000.

==History==
The Bamangwato people, under Kgosi Khama III, are widely believed to be the first people to have settled near present-day Palapye. Their capital was the settlement of Phalatswe, also called Old Palapye, and was situated at the western end of the Tswapong Hills. Palapye was originally spelled as Phalatswe, which meant the place for impalas.

It existed up to 1902, and the ruins of its church, built in 1892, are still to be seen a few kilometres from Palapye&#x27;s town centre. Chief Khama contributed some 3,000 pounds to its construction and took a keen interest in church affairs. The Bamangwato people&#x27;s houses were initially clustered around the church, but finding its vicinity too rocky, they moved from Gaborone and away.

The name Palapye, formerly rendered as Palachwe or Palapye, refers to the Impala antilope.

==Geography==
Palapye is situated nearly north of the Tropic of Capricorn, by the Lotsane River, towards the central-eastern edge of Botswana.
===Climate===
Summer months are from mid-September to mid-April. Summers are very hot in Palapye, with daytime temperatures reaching up to 40 °C. Thunderstorms are plentiful in the summer. Rainfall levels reach usually a minimum of 300 mm annually. Winters in Palapye are mild and dry.

==Demographics==
Palapye&#x27;s population is believed to be bordering the 80,000 mark, however, this is not an official figure, with many quarters arguing that the actual number is much higher or lower. According to 2022 2022 Population and Housing Census preliminary results, Palapye has registered 3.3% population growth rate from 2011 it was 37,256 and in 2022 is 52,398, Christianity is the main religious belief amongst Palapye citizens. However, there is considerable population of Muslim and Hindu believers in the town.

==Infrastructure and developments==
The Palapye Water Affairs currently provides the town with an abundant supply of water. The works is located a few kilometres outside the town. The Affairs provides Serowe with water, through a new pipe network since 2008.
Due to current blackouts across the country, resulting from South Africa&#x27;s refusal to supply electricity to Botswana, construction has been halted for many projects. However, they have resumed, the most important project being the expansion of the Morupule Power Station. The Morupule Expansion Project 1, with an estimated budget of P1.5 billion, is expected to produce 3.8 million tonnes of coal.

Plans for a new hospital, similar to the newly constructed Serowe Hospital, have also been proposed. A new police station has been completed in 2012. It is located along the A1 Highway in the old industrial area.

From being a mere stop-over, Palapye is rapidly developing to one of Botswana&#x27;s main financial, residential, industrial and educational hubs. New malls and educational institutions continue to mushroom gradually in Palapye. The town&#x27;s physical size has more than doubled since the 1990s.

Palapye also has a professional recording studio, called Ruff Riddims, built in early 2009. It is the first of its kind in Palapye.

==Sport==
The main sport played in Palapye is football, with many people also playing softball and volleyball. Sports are usually played at school grounds, which have adequate facilities and fields. Palapye has currently six known soccer teams, Palapye All Stars, Morupule Wanderers, FC Palapye, Palapye United and Palapye Swallows and Motlakase Power Dynamos. However, due to there being no stadium in the town, the three teams which usually played at Premier and First Division league usually play their matches elsewhere, although occasionally some games are played Palapye Swallows and PU Grounds. While in those leagues they play their matches in Orapa, Francistown, Sua, Maun or Selibe Phikwe. Both teams are not well known teams, gathering only a very small handful of supporters.

==Education==
Lotsane Senior Secondary School is one of the main government schools in Palapye. It accommodates learners from Forms 4 to 5. It is one of the very few boarding schools in the area and publishes a school newsletter called &quot;Lotsane&quot;.Other government schools in Palapye include Mabogo JSS, Palapye JSS and Mmaphula JSS. Popular private institutions in the town are; Kgaswe High School and Royal Professional College (which also offers tertiary level programmes). Also, there is a vocational institution that existed for over fifteen years in the town; Palapye Technical College (PATECO), formerly Palapye Vocational Technical College (VTC).

===University===

Since the year 2000, rumours circulated of a university to be built in Palapye. After numerous delays and extensive research, a project was finally accepted in 2004. BIUST (Botswana International University of Science and Technology) began construction of its campus in December 2009. The construction of the first phase of the university was expected to cost, close to P450 million. It was completed in late 2012, with the first students enrolled in August 2012. These first students, initial attended school in Oodi at Oodi College of Applied Arts and Technology whilst awaiting completion of the BIUST campus. The university was intended to help ease the burden on the University of Botswana, in the country&#x27;s capital, Gaborone. The University of Botswana was struggling to meet the demand for an increased number of students. The BIUST Campus is situated on a site on the Tswapong Hills, south east of Palapye near the site of Palapye Water Affairs.

There is also a proposed plan by the University of Botswana to expand its Faculty of Medicine and locate it in Palapye.

==Transport==
===Road===
Palapye lies on the main A1 Highway, which connects Botswana&#x27;s two major cities, Gaborone and Francistown. There is a secondary road that leads to Serowe, and later, Orapa and Lethlakane.

===Rail===
The national railway, which connects all major towns and cities all over Botswana to each other, also passes through Palapye. The rail track through Palapye links the town to Gaborone and Francistown. Coal that is mined from other regions in Botswana, such as Selebi-Phikwe, is sent by rail to Palapye. A proposed rail link to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe has been touted to operate, but such plans are still to be considered by the government.

In 2008, proposals were made to build a new Trans-Kalahari Railway to a port in Namibia, but this is expected to begin construction in 2025.

===Air===
Palapye Airport is a small airfield located just outside the town.

An International Airport, that will be located on the Palapye-Serowe road, is another development that is being considered. If plans do go ahead for the proposed Palapye International Airport, it will be the country&#x27;s fifth international airport, after Sir Seretse Khama International Airport in Gaborone, Francistown Airport, Maun Airport and Kasane Airport, easing the increased traffic that is currently being experienced at the present airports. However, such plans have been put on halt due to the current renovations and expansion at Gaborone Airport and a newly renovated Francistown Airport.

==Tourist attractions==
There are several well-known tourist attractions close to Palapye. Khama Rhino Sanctuary, outside of neighbouring Serowe, is probably the best known and is some from Palapye. Here, there are endangered black and white rhino.

The Tswapong Hills also have many areas of historical significance and well as the Moremi Gorge. This is an area of great beauty as it has a permanent water source.

<text>A polymorphic engine (sometimes called mutation engine or mutating engine) is a software component that uses polymorphic code to alter the payload while preserving the same functionality.
Polymorphic engines are used almost exclusively in malware, with the purpose of being harder for antivirus software to detect. They do so either by encrypting or obfuscating the malware payload.
One common deployment is a file binder that weaves malware into normal files, such as office documents. Since this type of malware is usually polymorphic, it is also known as a &quot;polymorphic packer&quot;.

The engine of the Virut botnet is an example of a polymorphic engine.

<doc id="979298" wikidata="Q2460827" url="?curid=979298" title="Nick Dandolos">
<text>Nikolaos Andreas Dandolos ( ; April 27, 1883 – December 25, 1966), commonly known as Nick the Greek, was a Greek professional gambler and high roller.

== Early life ==

Dandolos was the son of wealthy parents. He attended the Greek Evangelical College and earned a degree in philosophy. When he was 18 years old, his grandfather sent him to the United States with an allowance of $150 per week. Although Dandolos settled in Chicago he eventually moved to Montreal where he began gambling on horse races.

Dandolos was known throughout his life for winning and losing large sums of money. After winning over $500,000 on horse racing, he moved back to Chicago where he lost it all on card and dice games. He quickly became a master of these games, however, and became a prime attraction at casinos when he would play in them.

== Poker and gambling ==

From January 1949 to May 1949, Dandolos played a two-person &quot;heads up&quot; poker match against poker legend Johnny Moss where the two played virtually every variation of the game that existed at the time. The game, set up by Benny Binion as a tourist attraction, is widely credited as being the inspiration for the modern day World Series of Poker.

At the end of this five-month poker marathon, down an estimated $2–4 million, Dandolos uttered what has become one of the most famous poker quotes ever: &quot;Mr. Moss, I have to let you go.&quot;

One urban legend claims that Dandolos once had the opportunity to escort Albert Einstein around Las Vegas. Thinking that his gambling friends may not be familiar with him, Dandolos allegedly introduced Einstein as &quot;Little Al from Princeton&quot; and stated that he &quot;controlled a lot of the numbers action around Jersey.&quot; According to Dandolos&#x27;s own testimony in &quot;Gambling Secrets of Nick the Greek&quot;, just before the end of World War II, he got a call from a friend at the US State Department. The caller said that there was someone who was looking for a poker game on a weekend in Manhattan. Dandolos reminded his friend that gambling is illegal in New York, but his friend said that he would see to it that no law enforcement would get involved. At the game, according to Dandolos, he introduced Albert Einstein as &quot;Little Al from Jersey.&quot;

Another urban legend has him winning one million dollars against a Texan. In the early hours of the morning, Dandolos felt tired and called an end to the game. The Texan accused him of chickening out while the going was good. Dandolos then called for a new deck of cards, shuffled them and asked the Texan if he wanted to cut the cards (high card wins) one time, for double or quit. The Texan declined and they went home.

Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman also met Dandolos, according to the autobiographical &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;. Dandolos explained how he won big not by playing the tables, but by knowing the odds at the tables and betting against others who have superstitious beliefs about the outcome. He then relied on his reputation to bet against others.

In Eliot Asinof&#x27;s &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, the author attributes this gambling wisdom to Dandolos: &quot;Never bet on anything that can talk.&quot;

== Later life ==

Near the end of his life, Dandolos was near-broke and playing $5 limit draw poker games in Gardena, California. When asked by a fellow player how he could once play for millions and now be playing for such small stakes, Dandolos supposedly replied, &quot;Hey, it&#x27;s action, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

=== Death ===

He died on Christmas Day in 1966. He was a charter inductee of the Poker Hall of Fame in 1979.

== Legacy ==
It&#x27;s estimated that he won and lost over $500 million in his lifetime. He himself claimed that he went from rags to riches over 73 times. He donated over $20 million to education and charity.

A book by Ted Thackrey was published in 1968 titled &quot;Gambling Secrets of Nick the Greek&quot;.

A novel about Dandolos&#x27; life was written by Harry Mark Petrakis in 1978 titled &quot;Nick the Greek&quot;.

A song about Dandolos titled &quot;The Great Dandolos&quot; was included in 2014 &quot;Vigilante&quot;, a record by a Greek band called Planet of Zeus.

==In popular culture==

In the Damon Runyon short story, &quot;Romance in the Roaring Forties&quot;, Dandolos is mentioned by name, as a guest at the Prohibition-era New York wedding of Miss Billy Perry. Other guests are Waldo Winchester (a thinly-disguised Walter Winchell), Skeets Boliver, Feet Samuels, and Good Time Charley Bernstein, showing Dandolos as part of the louche guys-and-dolls culture of Broadway in the Roaring Twenties.

He also appears in Runyon&#x27;s short story &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;, playing at Nathan Detroit&#x27;s floating crap game in New York. The unnamed narrator has been dragged into the game by a gangster, and notes that it is more than somewhat full of very tough guys indeed, there with some of the towns highest rollers:

A brief appearance is made by Dandolos at a party in Runyon&#x27;s short story &quot;Madame La Gimp&quot;, where he impersonates Heywood Broun.

In &quot;Shotgun&quot;, the fifth episode in the fourth season of American crime drama television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, Walter White gets called &quot;Nick the Greek&quot; by his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, as the latter thought that the former won a lot of money by playing blackjack with a special strategy.

<doc id="979303" wikidata="Q2784317" url="?curid=979303" title="Yaoguai">
<text>Yaoguai () represent a broad and diverse class of ambiguous creatures in Chinese folklore and mythology defined by the possession of supernatural powers and by having attributes that partake of the quality of the weird, the strange or the unnatural. They are especially associated with transformation and enchantment. They often dwell in remote areas or on the fringes of civilization where they produce all manner of unexplainable phenomena and mischief. They often have predatory or malevolent tendencies.

Yaoguai vary considerably from one another in appearance and powers, and depending on particular individual or type, as being capable of shapeshifting, creating illusions, hypnosis, controlling minds, causing disease, clairvoyance, and draining the life force of mortals. 

While yaoguai are not evil in the sense Western demons are, they are usually weird and dangerous, tending to exert a baleful influence on mankind.In more superstitious times, confusion and bewilderment, strange and unexplainable disease, eerie sights and strange sounds, and cases of unexplained murders and missing persons were attributed to them, hence the folk saying: &quot;出反常必有妖&quot;, which simply means &quot;extraordinary occurrences are due to the yao [guai]&quot;.

Yaoguai are popular staples of modern Chinese fiction, appearing in books, movies and comics. The have also begun to appear in video games.

== Relation to Japanese yokai ==
Japanese &quot;yokai&quot; is the Japanese transliteration or pronunciation of the Chinese term &quot;yaoguai&quot; and involves similarly strange creatures, with both languages using the same Chinese characters to describe them.

== Comparison to Western demons ==
A popular translation for them in Western texts is simply &quot;demon&quot;, but this label can be very misleading, demons in the religious sense are termed &quot;mo&quot; () rather than &quot;yao&quot; (). Other translations include &quot;fiend&quot;, &quot;monster&quot;, &quot;goblin&quot;, &quot;evil spirit&quot; or &quot;bogeyman&quot;. These creatures blur the boundaries between the natural and the unnatural, the human and the non-human, and their appearance in tales is often related to political portents or as a reflection of the social and cosmopolitical order.

Yaoguai is often translated as &quot;demon&quot; in English, but unlike the European concept of demons, a term heavily laden with moral and theological implications, the yaoguai are simply a category of creatures with supernatural (or preternatural) abilities and may be amoral rather than immoral, capricious rather than inherently wicked. As described in literature, many of them are capable of falling in love with mortals, repenting, and of exhibiting the full range of human emotions, desires and values.

== Psychological underpinnings ==
In the folkloric tradition, their existence derives partly from the general fear of the unknown or the unknowable. General anxiety over social and political undercurrents, as well as psychological escapism may have provided the impetus for the literary tradition. The popular imagining of the yaoguai may also have received further stimulus from the activities of suppressed fox-spirit cults and other heterodox religious sects in China, from which their association with sorcery derives, as well as from the beliefs of minority tribes. 

== Distinction between yao guai and other supernatural beings in Chinese folklore ==
See also: List of Supernatural Beings in Chinese Folklore, Chinese mythology 

Gui (鬼), Guai (怪) , Yao (妖), Mo (魔) and Xie (邪)

Chinese texts and beliefs abound with descriptions of the strange and supernatural, and do not always use consistent terminology. The word &quot;妖&quot; &quot;yao&quot; itself carries strong connotations of supernatural power, usually of the kind that runs contrary to the prescribed order of nature or heaven, and &quot;妖术&quot; (lit. &quot;yao technique&quot;) means sorcery.

In Chinese texts, specific yao 妖 are sometimes referred to as 鬼 (gui, spectre or ghost), 怪 (guai, strange monster), 魔 (mo, demon close to the Western sense) or 邪 (xie, spiritually deviant or morally corrupt being). Despite the overlapping connotations and senses and their somewhat interchangeable use, these words have different core meanings and commonly refer to creatures that are not yao 妖. The narrow sense of each word refers to different kinds of beings that can be distinguished, usually as follows: 

* Gui (鬼) more properly refers to the spirits of the dead , although it can also refer to specters and daemons such as the yao 妖 generally. 
* Guai (怪) means any strange event, object (animate or inanimate) or person (&quot;奇异的事物或人&quot;) while guaiwu (怪物) means &quot;strange thing&quot; (&quot;奇异的东西&quot;). Monsters without supernatural powers (hence not yao 妖) may be also referred to as guai 怪 or guaiwu 怪物.
* Mo (魔) means demon in the religious sense - i.e. the sense that resembles devils and demons in the Western tradition. It also refers to fallen deities, immortals and even yao 妖 who have become extremely wicked.
* Xie (邪) carries the connotation of spiritual deviance, heterodoxy, or moral corruption and can even be used to refer to specific deities, as in 邪神, or corrupting devils 邪魔. Sometimes, used to described the yao 妖 in limited contexts. 
* The phrase &quot;yao mo gui guai&quot; &quot;妖魔鬼怪&quot; means all varieties of supernatural and strange beings but can be used as a metaphor to refer to all kinds of bad people.

A yao (妖, pinyin: yāo) is an eldritch and potentially predatory creature with uncanny properties, possessing supernatural powers such as shapeshifting, dwelling in remote wildernesses or at the fringes of civilization, and occasionally intruding into human civilization. It tends towards malevolence and generally has a harmful influence on humankind. They can be of either gender, but &quot;femme fatales&quot; are prominent in the literature. In folklore, their characteristic attributes are strangeness or otherworldliness, seductiveness, and an association with erratic behavior, bewilderment, and with disaster or misfortune. Whatever could not be readily understood by the population and that frightened them was generally regarded as &quot;妖&quot;.

&quot;《孔丛子·执节》“若中山之谷，妖怪之事，非所谓天祥也&quot;&quot;

&quot;If (while one) in the midst of the mountain valleys, yaoguai (are found) acting, (then) this is not auspicious.&quot; 

In their capricious tendencies and powers, they have some resemblance to the &quot;fae&quot; of Irish legend or the fairies of European lore. However, unlike the fae, the &quot;妖&quot; often possess the nature of a specific kind of animal or a plant (a vixen, a snake, a butterfly, or a tree or a flower), which may have been their original form. They are capable of assuming human, or near-human form, and of wielding either innate supernatural powers or abilities associated with Taoist cultivation.

The existence of these creatures or phenomena associated with them is generally an ill-omen and is described arising due to natural fluctuations in yin and yang, or to human activity which disrupts the moral or normative order.

===Typical powers===

Possession of supernatural power defines the yaoguai, distinguishing them from other monsters. Descriptions of the abilities of these beings vary considerably. Typical powers ascribed to them include shapeshifting, the manufacture of illusions, mind control, clairvoyance, the possession of human beings, and the control over natural forces.

For example, nine-tailed foxes are said to be clairvoyant beings able to poison others through sorcery and to take possession of others. In Yue Jun&#x27;s tale &quot;Hu Hao Hao&quot;, a &quot;fox spirit&quot; compels, through sorcery, a respectable couple to engage in a sexual threesome with it. Baigujing, a &quot;white skeleton essence&quot;, is described as an adept shapeshifter, taking on the forms of multiple people in an attempt to deceive her opponents. Others are capable of control over elemental forces, as when Bai Suzhen, a &quot;white snake&quot; &quot;fairy&quot; unleashes a supernatural flood against a temple.

===Origin===

Older references to the 妖 regard them as strange phenomena arising due to aberrations or anomalies in qi (the breath, energy or material force) pervading the natural world, or else from the passive absorption of universal energies of yin and yang over a long period of time. They may also have developed into their current state from engaging in the deliberate cultivation of supernatural power. Finally, they may also result due to disturbances to the moral and cosmic order. 

=== Disturbances to the moral and cosmic order ===
According to the classic text the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, &quot;when people abandon constancy then this causes the yao to emerge&quot; (&quot;人弃常则妖兴&quot;). In traditional Chinese thought, natural phenomena and human wellbeing and flourishing are correlated to moral conduct. The operative principle can be moral or natural - either Heavenly retribution or the philosophical concept of &quot;gan-ying&quot; or stimulus-response (also known as &quot;sympathetic resonance&quot;). The latter is a broad connective principle according to which &quot;like-begets-like&quot;, as when kindness begets kindness, thorns grow where armies are located, and where the musical analogy of resonating strings is often used.

* Black Calamity, a kind of injurious wind and vapor demon or group of such demons whose presence indicated the displeasure of Heaven, a disturbance to the moral and social order, and the need for repentance.

=== Born from anomalous or aberrant qi or energy ===
Some yaoguai arise spontaneously in nature due to anomalous or aberrant qi or energy. Examples include:
* Chimei (魑魅), a type of malevolent wilderness demon of the mountains and forests, are said to be born from aberrant qi (breath or energy) (&quot;&quot;魑魅 , 山林异气所生 , 为人害&quot;)&quot;

* Wangliang (魍魎), wilderness demons associated with rocks and trees (&quot;&quot;木石之怪曰夔 , 魍魎&quot;)&quot;

* Wangxiang (罔象&quot;) are wilderness demons that are born of water (&quot;&quot;水之怪曰龍 , 罔象&quot;)&quot;
=== Absorptions of cosmic energy over a long time ===
In Wang Chong&#x27;s 1st century text the &quot;Balanced Discussions&quot;, things such as animals, plants, and rocks are said to be endowed a human-like essence and capacities as a result of immense age (&quot;物之老者，其精为人&quot;).

* The Penghou tree demon, associated with the element wood and with camphor trees, is said to be formed over the course of long years in remote mountain forests, developing into a human-headed dog with no tail. 
* Lady White Bone or Baigujing was once the exposed skeleton of a maiden who, having absorbed the energies of the sun and moon over a long time, transformed into a shape-shifting daemon.

=== Deliberate cultivation ===

* Bai Suzhen was a serpent who through the cultivation of magical power, attained to human form. 
* Huli Jing are said to acquire their powers through both deliberate practice and immense age. Daji was a thousand-year-old fox spirit.

==Classical types and examples==
See also: Shenmo (&quot;Gods and Demons&quot;) literature, Zhiguai (&quot;Records of the Strange&quot;) Literature

Yaoguai are often the antagonists in both the Shen-Mo 神魔 (lit. &quot;Gods and demons fiction&quot;) genre and the Zhi-Guai 志怪 (lit. Zhiguai xiaoshuo|&quot;Strange tales&quot;) genre of literature.

In more superstitious times, they were also frequently believed to the culprits of strange occurrences and mysterious accidents, unexplained deaths and other ghastly phenomena.

Classical types in Chinese mythology, literature, and folklore include:

* Black Calamity (黑气): A roving black fog or vapor that inflicts injuries to persons and damage to property wherever it goes. A dog-like or serpentine being, or multiple such beings, can also be seen within the vapor. This demon or group of demons cannot be thwarted through normal weapons and ordinary means. Its presence indicates heaven&#x27;s displeasure and necessitates the need for repentance on the part of the emperor and the governing bureaucracy. 
* Fox Demons (狐妖): A recurring being in Chinese folk belief and literature. Said to be able to assume human form, and to have the supernatural ability to poison and inflict disease, to know things at a distance, to bewilder, and to derange. It is also able to take possession of human beings. In literature, it appears in Yue Jun&#x27;s Hu Hao Hao, where it compels a couple to engage in a forbidden sex act, and as Daji in Fengshenyanyi, where it leads the Shang King astray. The idea of a fox spirit appears to have been drawn in part from the activities of proscribed fox-spirit cults.
* Tiger Demons (虎妖): A recurring being in Chinese &quot;zhiguai&quot; (志怪) genre of literature, and also often blamed for actual missing persons cases in ancient China. Men were sometimes accused of being ravening tigers in human form and killed either by lynch mobs or being delivered up to magistrates to be put to death with state sanction. Sometimes these men had themselves confessed, likely under torture, to consuming other human beings.
* Wolf Demons (狼妖): Occurs sporadically in tales, but less frequently than fox spirits and tiger demons. Some Chinese writers supposed that the ancient Huns, Turks and Mongols were capable of transforming into wolves at leisure. A tale relates the discovery Wang Han from Taiyuan, whose father was Han Chinese and mother was a Hunnish woman adept at hunting. As his mother aged, she became unable to maintain her human form and eventually was discovered to be a wolf, escaping into the wilderness. Other tales relate of werewolves during a famine in the Ming dynasty.
* Snake Demons (蛇妖): Appears as an instrument of divine punishment but sometimes persecutes even the worthy. Occasionally appears as a seducer, shapeshifting into human form to gratify its lusts. Also said to be able to cause diseases, manifesting as horrific skin sores, through supernatural power. 
* Penghou (彭侯): A murderous tree demon that develops over the course of long years, taking the form of a tailless dog with a human head. It can be found in deep mountain forests and will attempt to kill passing travelers. It is associated with the essence of the wood element and with camphor trees. Additionally, it can be killed, boiled and eaten. 
* Chimei (魑魅): a kind of wilderness demon born of aberrant qi or strange energy in mountains and forests. It is malevolent and harmful to humans. Etymology suggests the ability to seduce or enthrall. 
* Wangliang (魍魎): a kind of wilderness demon associated with rivers and marshes, or else with apparitions between rocks and trees, or else a brain-eating sprite, and alternatively a plague-causing being, sometimes appearing in the form of a three-year old child with long hair. It can waylay and kill unwary travelers.

Specific characters from literature and folklore include:
* Bai Suzhen: a snake demoness that had managed to cultivate a human form, and who falls in love with a man named Xu Xian. Their love is repudiated by a monk, and she is ultimately trapped and sealed beneath a pagoda.
* Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord: a demon in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, whose true form is a centipede and whose eyes radiant brilliant light. He assumes the form of a Taoist priest and is attended to by seven spider demons.
* Sun Wukong, sometimes called a &quot;stone monkey demon&quot;, who grows powerful enough to challenge the entire Taoist pantheon
* Spider Demons: Seven sisters whose true form is that of a spider, and who are able to shoot webs from their navels. They assist the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.
* Lady White Bones (colloquially &quot;Baigujing&quot;): a shapeshifting demoness whose true form is a white skeleton, and who desires to eat the flesh of a holy man in order to obtain immortality.
* Niumowang: literally, &quot;bull demon king&quot;
* Daji: the thousand-year-old &quot;fox spirit&quot; in &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; who seduces the last king of Shang in order to precipitate the fall of his kingdom. 
* Pipa Jing and Jiutou Zhiji Jing in &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;, a magical pipa and a nine-headed pheasant who accompany Daji in her mission.
* &quot;Painted skin demon&quot;, featured in the Pu Song Ling&#x27;s The Painted Skin, a ghastly green ghoul with serrated teeth wearing a mask of human skin.

=== Taoist folklore ===
In Taoist folklore, &quot;yaoguai&quot; come from &quot;an imbalance in the&quot; Tao and &quot;any combination of [atypical] powers, including mind control, shapeshifting and the ability to create illusions.&quot;

== Typology ==

=== Shapeshifters causing supernatural afflictions ===
Folkloric belief and literature are replete with tales of shapeshifting &quot;daemons&quot; with the power to assume human form, to afflict with poison and disease, to bewilder, and to enthrall and seduce. The original form of these shapeshifters can vary widely, and include the fox, the tiger, the wolf, and the snake, amongst others. These creatures are often denominated by appending the character 妖 to their essential nature or original form. Accordingly, a fox demon may be denominated a 狐妖, a tiger demon as 虎妖, so on and so forth.

=== Predatory beings ===
Yaoguai are often depicted as injurious or predatory beings in Chinese folklore and literature who seek to consume or to drain the life force of living beings. The purpose in consuming human beings is often to obtain immortality or achieve godlike power, but sometimes is attributed to simple hunger. They may also cohabit with human beings, either as a prelude to consuming them, or in order to satisfy their lust.

Many employ sexual seduction as a tactic. Some belong to the &quot;femme fatale&quot; category of antagonists - assuming the form of beautiful women. Others masquerade as Taoist priests and or Buddhist monks in order to gain the trust of their victims. One example is the tale of the Painted Skin &quot;demon&quot; from Pu Song Ling, a green-skinned demon who wears a mask of human skin. Another example is Baigujing, the white-skeleton spirit, who adopts various disguises an attempt to consume the flesh of a holy man to obtain immortality. The Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord is a centipede who assumes the form of an elderly Taoist priest.

Yet others, like the wangliang, the tiger demon, and the wolf demon, are simply opportunistic ambush predators who rely on stealth and speed in order to satisfy their insatiable hunger. The Wangliang is an apparition that appears in the mountains and marshes that accosts travelers and that has a taste for human brains, relying on its stealthiness and speed to successfully kill its prey. The wolf demon and tiger demon are ravening beings roaming over wide areas to consume large numbers of people, assuming human form to evade detection.

=== Creatures with spiritual cultivation ===
In Chinese folklore, supernatural power and immortality can be attained by ordinary mortals and even animals through personal cultivation, often Taoist in nature. This cultivation usually involves some kind of meditative, spiritual, or hygienic practices, the consumption of certain foods, the absorption of certain natural energies, and mental and physical exercises. Through long perseverance in such practices, animals, plants and even inorganic matter such as rocks and musical instruments may gain supernatural power, immense wisdom, or human form through years of cultivation. The acquisition of sentience and supernatural power is called &quot;成精 (Chengjing)&quot;. A few take their cultivation even further, achieving immortal &quot;Xian&quot; (仙) status.

This category or type of Yao often appears in classic stories such as &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, &quot;Legend of the White Snake&quot;, &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. It is also alluded to in the works of the secular and naturalistic philosopher Wang Chong, who denied the existence of an afterlife and of ghosts, but claimed objects could acquire strange powers due to immense age.

=== Demoted gods ===
In the Chinese classical novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, some gods were banished to the mortal world and became Yaoguai because they violated the laws of heaven. The most representative ones are Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing. In addition, in the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; in the heavenly court, some immortals decide to privately descend on their own accord. Many of them are waiters and mounts around the gods, such as the Golden and Silver Horned Kings of the Taishang Laojun, Yellow Robe Demon, which was originally Kui Mulang, Maitreya Bodhisattva&#x27;s Yellow Brows Great King, Manjushri&#x27;s Azure Lion and so on. These end up becoming yaoguai.

== Literature ==

=== Shenmo (lit. &quot;gods and demons&quot;) genre of literature or mythic literature ===
See also: Shenmo (&quot;Gods and Demons&quot;) literature
Investiture of the Gods

In the literary text &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot;, the fox-sprite Daji is sent on a mission by the goddess Nuwa, to corrupt the last king of the Shang and to instigate the fall of his dynasty, as punishment for the latter composing a ribald poem. She is accompanied and aided by two other yaoguai - Pipa Jing, a magical instrument who has taken on the form of a maiden, and Jiutou Zhiji Jing, a nine-headed pheasant who has also acquired human form.

Journey to the West

In &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, many demons seek immortality through the abduction and consumption of a holy man (in this case, Tang Sanzang). This includes a baigujing, who was originally the exposed white skeleton of a maiden that upon absorbing the energies of the sun and moon over long course, transforms into a &quot;yaojing&quot; with shapeshifting powers. 

Baigujing yearns to consume the flesh of a holy man in order to obtain immortality. Other &quot;yao&quot; were fallen pets or mounts of deities, who, having been expelled from heaven, proceed to make a nuisance of themselves on earth. The text also describes &quot;yaoguai&quot; kings (&quot;mówáng&quot;) that command a number of lesser demon minions.

Notably, Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, uses this term often to insult his adversaries. However, Wukong himself is also referred to as a demon not long after his birth by the narrator of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; and by his adversaries during his conflict with Heaven.

=== Zhiguai (lit. &quot;strange tales&quot;) genre of literature ===
See also: Shenmo (&quot;Gods and Demons&quot;) literature

Yaoguai are the antagonists in a genre of literature known as zhiguai literature. Although they were produced principally for entertainment, it is worth noting that the appearance of anomalies in this genre literature is often associated with sociopolitical portents and a reflection of the current state of the cosmopolitical order, and that themes of dissatisfaction with the human condition resonate in the texts and lives of authors.

===Hu Hao Hao (lit. &quot;what the fox loves to indulge in&quot;)===

Repressed sexuality is often a theme in such literature. In Yue Jun&#x27;s collection &quot;Hu Hao Hao&quot;, a couple is forced to engage in a threesome with a fox spirit against their will, and are powerless to resist the yaoguai. Yue Jun however, publicly disclaimed any didactic purpose in his writing, saying that these tales were not to be taken too seriously, implying they were written for the purposes of entertainment.
&quot;Painted Skin&quot;
Another theme is the ambivalent nature of beauty, which can mask great evil. This theme was the driving force behind Pu Song Ling&#x27;s tale the &quot;Painted Skin&quot;, as the author himself noted in a postscript:

&quot;How foolish men are, to see nothing but beauty in what is clearly evil! And how benighted to dismiss as absurd what is clearly well-intended! It is folly such as this that obliges the lady Chen to steel herself to eat another man&#x27;s phlegm, when her husband has fallen prey to lust. Heaven&#x27;s Way has its inexorable justice, but some mortals remain foolish and never see the light!&quot;

==Etymology and disambiguation==
===Etymology===

Yaoguai (妖怪) is a compound word consisting of two Chinese characters often translated as &quot;monster&quot;&quot;, fiend&quot;&quot;, bogeyman,&quot; or &quot;demon. 

Analyzing the compound word into the two separate words:

* 妖 (yāo) is a word which can mean eldritch, seductive, or sinister and beguiling, or a being with such characteristics, or strange, weird and supernatural. 
* 怪 (guài) means &quot;strange&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; when used as an adjective, and any &quot;monster&quot; or &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;unusual creature&quot; as a standalone noun. 

While both of the words 妖 and 怪 signify and connote strangeness, but 妖 carries the additional connotation of seduction or supernatural enthrallment, whereas 怪 signifies a strange monster.

Terms like yaogui (妖鬼; yāoguǐ, &#x27;strange ghost&#x27;), yaomo (妖魔; yāomó, &#x27;daemon&#x27;), yaojing (妖精; yāojīng, often translated as &quot;sprite&quot; or &quot;faerie&quot;), and yaopo (妖婆; yaopo, &quot;hag&quot; or &quot;witch&quot;) are either types of Yaoguai (妖怪) or related beings. 

The Japanese term yokai is simply the Japanese transliteration or pronunciation of the 妖怪 yāoguài, and involves similarly strange creatures.

====Classical usages====

Classical usages of 妖 refer to preternatural phenomena and freakish occurrences where explanation fell outside the limited understanding of observers. These include:

* freakish vegetation (&quot;草妖&quot;), 
* eerie sounds (&quot;鼓妖&quot;), 
* the unnatural onset of fog and darkness (&quot;夜妖&quot;), 
* a sudden loss in verbal fluency or inability to express oneself (&quot;诗妖&quot;)
* sudden outbreaks of confused and erratic action, or transgressive behaviour (&quot;胡作非为&quot;)

There is also a classical saying: &quot;when affairs go awry, there must have been a yāo (acting)&quot; (&quot;事出反必有妖&quot;).

====Later usages====

In later terminology, &quot;yāo&quot; refers to natural objects (animals, plants or rocks) which have acquired sentience (lit. spiritual awareness), the ability to assume human or near-human forms, supernatural or magical powers, as well as the ability to cultivate so as to achieve immortality or transcendence.

===Disambiguation===

The terms yao 妖, gui 鬼, mo 魔 and guai 怪 are sometimes used interchangeably in the same text for the same creature, since these tales focus on producing entertaining or thrilling narratives rather than linguistic precision. This is true even though the creature satisfies the classical definition of a Yao 妖. 

However, in the strict sense, Yao (妖) are usually seen as distinct creatures from &quot;ghosts and spectres&quot; (鬼, pinyin: gui), &quot;demons and devils&quot; (魔, pinyin: mo), &quot;monsters and aberrations&quot; 怪 (pinyin: guai). The differences may be thus explained: 

Narrowly speaking, &quot;gui (鬼)&quot; are the spirits of the deceased, whereas &quot;mo 魔&quot; are either demons in the religious sense, or fallen immortals that have succumbed to evil or who have elected to take a forbidden path for whatever reason. Meanwhile, &quot;guai (怪)&quot; on a standalone basis maintains a broad original meaning and can refer to any strange creature.

Ultimately the yaoguai (妖怪) are not demons in the religious or the traditional western sense; they are neither archfiends nor fallen angels, neither the inveterate foes of mankind&#x27;s salvation nor are they hardened rebels against the divine principle. They are often capable of sympathy, love, repentance, and even remorse, and of forming families with human beings. Instead, the word 魔 is used to refer to demons when translating Buddhist or Christian or other religious texts. 

==In popular culture==
Yaoguai feature liberally in modern popular culture, including cinema of the xianxia (lit. &quot;immortal hero&quot;) genre and in comic books about cultivators.

===Modern adaptations in Chinese cinema and culture===
* In the 1987 HK film entitled A Chinese Ghost Story a &quot;yaoguai i&quot;n the form of a &quot;tree demon&quot; was the main antagonist. The &quot;tree demon&quot; was able to command the spirits of the dead to do its bidding, and one of the ghosts falls in love and saves the main protagonist, Nie Huaiqing.
* In the 1990 HK film entitled A Chinese Ghost Story II a yaoguai in the form of a &quot;centipede demon&quot; with magical powers masquerades as a Buddhist monk to consume the essence of the ministers of the royal court. 
* In the 2017 movie &quot;Wish Upon&quot;, a Yaoguai is the spirit of the music box, which grants seven wishes but kills someone close to the owner every time a wish is granted. If the seventh wish is granted, the Yaoguai will claim the soul of the owner.
* Yaojing and Yaoguai appear in popular TV series produced in China, such as &quot;Love and Redemption&quot;, &quot;Three Lives&quot;, &quot;Three Loves&quot;, &quot;Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms&quot;, and &quot;Ashes of Love&quot;. Aside from the typical fox spirits who appear in these creatures, other examples of yao* include animals, plants, and inanimate objects. All three of these series are based on Chinese e-novels in the Chinese Fantasy genre. In this genre, various types of yao* are distinguished by whether they have celestial or demonic spiritual roots, but characters with either root may be good, evil, or neutral.
** In any case, the creatures called &quot;yao*&quot; in the story will basically not be tolerated by human society or the world governed by gods. It is already unwritten that they are arrested, sanctioned, eradicated, or forced into society by humans or gods.
* The video game &quot;Amazing Cultivation Simulator&quot; contains 12 different races of yaoguai that the player may choose to be members of their colony.
* The Taiwanese black metal band Chthonic has a drummer who wears a metal mask of a black demon mouth.
* The video game Black Myth: Wukong rooted in Journey to the West shows a wide variety of yaoguai inspired by Chinese traditional mythology.
Japanese adaptations

* The Yaoguai&#x27;s Yaomo alias was used in &quot;AdventureQuest Worlds&quot; during its 2014 Akiba&#x27;s New Year celebration on Yokai Island. It is depicted as a horned half-demon half-horse creature (with its build being similar to a centaur) with additional eyes on its chest and parts of the horse body. It was responsible for corrupting Akiba&#x27;s Jingshen Forest causing the Qilin Senlin-Ma (who was the guardian of the Jingshen Forest) to enlist the player for help. The players were able to defeat the Yaomo.

===Western adaptations===
* The &quot;Fallout&quot; series features mutated bears identified as Yao Guai. These creatures roam many parts of post-War America, appearing in &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, the &quot;&quot; DLC &quot;Honest Hearts&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, and &quot;Fallout 76&quot;. They attack both the player and various non-player characters. In &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, one of the in-game radio stations broadcasts an occasional public service announcement reminding listeners &quot;don&#x27;t feed the Yao Guai&quot;. In &quot;Fallout&quot; lore, the Yao Guai were named by descendants of Chinese internment camp prisoners.
* In the &quot;Dark Aether&quot; (&quot;Zombies&quot;) storyline of the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot;, the QBZ-83 assault rifle can be upgraded (&quot;pack-a-punched&quot;), giving the gun the name &quot;yaoguai&quot;.
* In the DLC &quot;Nightmare in North Point&quot; of the video game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, players fight demonic creatures called &quot;Yaoguai&quot;.
* The American fantasy television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; featured a creature called a Yaoguai in the second-season episode &quot;The Outsider&quot;. Here, it was depicted as a large lion-like creature with a mane of fire. Maleficent transformed Prince Phillip into a Yaoguai until it was undone by Belle.
* An episode of the television series &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; features the Yaoguai as a demon who is attracted to aggression and gunpowder from a gun.
* The mobile game &quot;Gems of War&quot; features a legendary troop called Yao Guai.
* In the 2023 TV series &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;, based on the 2006 graphic novel, the main antagonist is Niu Mowang.

<text>In astrodynamics, orbital station-keeping is keeping a spacecraft at a fixed distance from another spacecraft or celestial body. It requires a series of orbital maneuvers made with thruster burns to keep the active craft in the same orbit as its target. For many low Earth orbit satellites, the effects of non-Keplerian forces, i.e. the deviations of the gravitational force of the Earth from that of a homogeneous sphere, gravitational forces from Sun/Moon, solar radiation pressure and air drag, must be counteracted.
For spacecraft in a halo orbit around a Lagrange point, station-keeping is even more fundamental, as such an orbit is unstable; without an active control with thruster burns, the smallest deviation in position or velocity would result in the spacecraft leaving orbit completely.

==Perturbations==
The deviation of Earth&#x27;s gravity field from that of a homogeneous sphere and gravitational forces from the Sun and Moon will in general perturb the orbital plane. For a Sun-synchronous orbit, the precession of the orbital plane caused by the oblateness of the Earth is a desirable feature that is part of mission design but the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon is undesirable. For geostationary spacecraft, the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon must be counteracted by a rather large expense of fuel, as the inclination should be kept sufficiently small for the spacecraft to be tracked by non-steerable antennae.

For spacecraft in a low orbit, the effects of atmospheric drag must often be compensated for, often to avoid re-entry; for missions requiring the orbit to be accurately synchronized with the Earth’s rotation, this is necessary to prevent a shortening of the orbital period.

Solar radiation pressure will in general perturb the eccentricity (i.e. the eccentricity vector); see Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft). For some missions, this must be actively counter-acted with maneuvers. For geostationary spacecraft, the eccentricity must be kept sufficiently small for a spacecraft to be tracked with a non-steerable antenna. Also for Earth observation spacecraft for which a very repetitive orbit with a fixed ground track is desirable, the eccentricity vector should be kept as fixed as possible. A large part of this compensation can be done by using a frozen orbit design, but often thrusters are needed for fine control maneuvers.

==Low Earth orbit==

For spacecraft in a very low orbit, the atmospheric drag is sufficiently strong to cause a re-entry before the intended end of mission if orbit raising maneuvers are not executed from time to time.

An example of this is the International Space Station (ISS), which has an operational altitude above Earth&#x27;s surface of between 400 and 430 km (250-270 mi). Due to atmospheric drag the space station is constantly losing orbital energy. In order to compensate for this loss, which would eventually lead to a re-entry of the station, it has to be reboosted to a higher orbit from time to time. The chosen orbital altitude is a trade-off between the average thrust needed to counter-act the air drag and the impulse needed to send payloads and people to the station. 

GOCE which orbited at 255 km (later reduced to 235 km) used ion thrusters to provide up to 20 mN of thrust to compensate for the drag on its frontal area of about 1 m2.

==Earth observation spacecraft==

For Earth observation spacecraft typically operated in an altitude above the Earth surface of about 700 – 800 km the air-drag is very faint and a re-entry due to air-drag is not a concern. But if the orbital period should be synchronous with the Earth&#x27;s rotation to maintain a fixed ground track, the faint air-drag at this high altitude must also be counter-acted by orbit raising maneuvers in the form of thruster burns tangential to the orbit. These maneuvers will be very small, typically in the order of a few mm/s of delta-v. If a frozen orbit design is used these very small orbit raising maneuvers are sufficient to also control the eccentricity vector.

To maintain a fixed ground track it is also necessary to make out-of-plane maneuvers to compensate for the inclination change caused by Sun/Moon gravitation. These are executed as thruster burns orthogonal to the orbital plane. For Sun-synchronous spacecraft having a constant geometry relative to the Sun, the inclination change due to the solar gravitation is particularly large; a delta-v in the order of 1–2 m/s per year can be needed to keep the inclination constant. 

== Geostationary orbit ==
For geostationary spacecraft, thruster burns orthogonal to the orbital plane must be executed to compensate for the effect of the lunar/solar gravitation that perturbs the orbit pole with typically 0.85 degrees per year. The delta-v needed to compensate for this perturbation keeping the inclination to the equatorial plane amounts to in the order 45 m/s per year. This part of the GEO station-keeping is called North-South control.

The East-West control is the control of the orbital period and the eccentricity vector performed by making thruster burns tangential to the orbit. These burns are then designed to keep the orbital period perfectly synchronous with the Earth rotation and to keep the eccentricity sufficiently small. Perturbation of the orbital period results from the imperfect rotational symmetry of the Earth relative the North/South axis, sometimes called the ellipticity of the Earth equator. The eccentricity (i.e. the eccentricity vector) is perturbed by the solar radiation pressure. The fuel needed for this East-West control is much less than what is needed for the North-South control.

To extend the life-time of geostationary spacecraft with little fuel left one sometimes discontinues the North-South control only continuing with the East-West control. As seen from an observer on the rotating Earth the spacecraft will then move North-South with a period of 24 hours. When this North-South movement gets too large a steerable antenna is needed to track the spacecraft. An example of this is Artemis.

To save weight, it is crucial for GEO satellites to have the most fuel-efficient propulsion system. Almost all modern satellites are therefore employing a high specific impulse system like plasma or ion thrusters.

== Lagrange points ==

Orbits of spacecraft are also possible around Lagrange points—also referred to as libration points—five equilibrium points that exist in relation to two larger solar system bodies. For example, there are five of these points in the Sun-Earth system, five in the Earth-Moon system, and so on. Spacecraft may orbit around these points with a minimum of propellant required for station-keeping purposes. Two orbits that have been used for such purposes include halo and Lissajous orbits.

One important Lagrange point is Earth-Sun , and three heliophysics missions have been orbiting L1 since approximately 2000. Station-keeping propellant use can be quite low, facilitating missions that can potentially last decades should other spacecraft systems remain operational. The three spacecraft—Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Global Geoscience WIND satellite—each have annual station-keeping propellant requirements of approximately 1 m/s or less.
Earth-Sun —approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth in the anti-sun direction—is another important Lagrange point, and the ESA Herschel space observatory operated there in a Lissajous orbit during 2009–2013, at which time it ran out of coolant for the space telescope. Small station-keeping orbital maneuvers were executed approximately monthly to maintain the spacecraft in the station-keeping orbit.

The James Webb Space Telescope will use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around the Earth-Sun L2, which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime: it is being designed to carry enough for ten years. However, the precision of trajectory following launch by an Ariane 5 is credited with potentially doubling the lifetime of the telescope by leaving more hydrazine propellant on-board than expected.

The CAPSTONE orbiter and the planned Lunar Gateway is stationed along a 9:2 synodically resonant Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) around the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point.

<doc id="979324" wikidata="Q4664085" url="?curid=979324" title="Abbey of the Genesee">
<text>The Abbey of the Genesee is a community of more than two dozen contemplative monks located near Piffard in the town of York, New York. They are a member of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, commonly known as the Trappists. They were founded from the Abbey of Gethsemani in Bardstown, Kentucky in 1951. The Abbey of the Genesee is well known for its production of &quot;Monks&#x27; Bread&quot; which is baked by the monks and sold commercially, providing an income stream to support the monastic community.

==Monks&#x27; Bread==
A significant part of the monks&#x27; labor includes baking a brand of bread called Monks&#x27; Bread which is sold at the Abbey store and distributed to regional supermarkets. The sale of the bread helps support the abbey and its inhabitants. The bread was originally made by one of the monks, Brother Sylvester, for the monastic community and its guests. Over time, demand for loaves from outsiders gradually led to the development of the current commercial operation.

The bread is baked several times each week in the early hours of the morning. For that reason the monks go to bed around seven at night in order to rise about two in the morning. For reasons of security and hygiene, it is not possible to observe the baking process except through slides and photographs.

Several varieties of bread are baked, including white, whole wheat, rye, and raisin, along with a number of other products such as gourmet coffee, jams and fruitcakes.

== Visitors ==
The abbey chapel is open from 3:30 am to 7:30 pm. The abbey store is open from 10:00am to 4:00pm on certain days. Casual visitors are able to enter only a restricted part of the abbey. The abbey is open to serious individual guests and small groups who wish to make a retreat and avail themselves of the counseling of the monks. A small fee is charged to cover expenses.

== Literature ==
In 1974, the Dutch priest and writer Henri Nouwen was allowed to live with the community of monks as a temporary member for seven months. This is rather unusual, because while the Trappists do accept retreatants for some days, it is usually not possible to become a &quot;temporary monk&quot; as Nouwen did. The permission was granted particularly due to Nouwen&#x27;s close friendship with Abbot John Eudes.

After his retreat, Nouwen&#x27;s diary was published in 1976 under the title &quot;The Genesee Diary - Report from a Trappist Monastery&quot;. This book is now deemed one of the fundamental works about Trappist spirituality and contemplative life in general. It is also widely recommended to be read by prospective monks during their vocational discernment.

<text>BBC Radio Ulster is a Northern Irish national radio station owned and operated by BBC Northern Ireland, a division of the BBC. It was established on New Year&#x27;s Day 1975, replacing what had been an opt-out of BBC Radio 4.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 462,000 with a listening share of 16.2% as of March 2024.

==Overview==

It is the most widely listened to radio station in Northern Ireland, with a diverse range of programmes, including news, talk, features, music and sport. In the Q3 2021 RAJAR survey, the station had 517,000 weekly listeners, with total weekly listening hours of 5.5 million, beating its main local rivals (Cool FM, Downtown Radio, Downtown Country, U105, and Q Radio) on both of these metrics and, logically therefore, average weekly hours per listener (10.64). When taken together, the Bauer-owned stations (both Downtown stations and Cool FM) had higher total audience and listening hours per week, but lower average weekly hours per listener. The station had 135,000 more weekly listeners than its equivalent in Wales, BBC Radio Wales, despite serving a RAJAR population 1.1 million smaller. The station had the highest percentage reach and listening share, per corresponding survey area, of any BBC local, nations or national radio station, at 34% and 19.9% respectively.

It is broadcast from BBC Northern Ireland&#x27;s Broadcasting House in Belfast. News bulletins are broadcast usually on the hour seven days a week from 6:30 am until midnight (on weekdays), from 6:45 am until midnight (on Saturdays) and from 7:00 am to midnight (on weekends, Christmas holidays, and Bank Holidays). It is available on 92-95 FM, DAB and Freeview in Northern Ireland and across the UK on BBC Sounds and satellite/cable television. It is also available in Ireland via BBC Sounds, Virgin Media, on smart speakers or on FM in counties bordering Northern Ireland. The station was available on medium wave on 1341 kHz and 873 kHz until 6 May 2021.

An opt-out of the station exists in Derry, BBC Radio Foyle, carrying alternative programming and news between 8:00am and 4:00pm weekdays. The station is also broadcast on DAB Digital Radio, digital television and on the Internet. During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Ulster simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live programming.

==Funding==
The BBC reported in the Annual Report for 2017/18 that Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle operated on a budget of £17.6 million with a 38% reach of the population and that the cost per hour of output was 5.8p.

<doc id="979332" wikidata="Q698855" url="?curid=979332" title="Carpathian Germans">
<text>Carpathian Germans (, or &quot;felvidéki németek&quot;, , , ) are a group of ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe. The term was coined by the historian Raimund Friederich Kaindl (1866–1930), originally generally referring to the German-speaking population of the area around the Carpathian Mountains: the Cisleithanian (Austrian) crown lands of Galicia and Bukovina, as well as the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy (including Szepes County), and the northwestern (Maramuresch) region of Romania. Since the First World War, only the Germans of Slovakia (the Slovak Germans or &quot;Slowakeideutsche&quot;, including the Zipser Germans) and those of Carpathian Ruthenia in Ukraine have commonly been called &quot;Carpathian Germans&quot;.

== Kingdom of Hungary ==

Germans settled in the northern territory of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (then called Upper Hungary, today mostly Slovakia) from the 12th to the 15th centuries (&quot;see Ostsiedlung&quot;), mostly after the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe. There had probably already been some isolated settlers in the area of Pressburg (Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava). The Germans were usually attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in older Slavic market and mining settlements. Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Slovakia were almost exclusively composed of Germans.

The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Pressburg and some language islands in Szepes County (Hungarian: &quot;Szepesség&quot;; German: &quot;Zips&quot;; Latin: &quot;Scepusium&quot;, today Spiš region in Slovakia) and the Hauerland regions. The settlers in the Szepes County were known as &quot;Zipser Sachsen&quot; (Zipser Saxons, Hungarian: &quot;cipszerek&quot;). Within Carpathian Ruthenia, they initially settled around Taracköz (German: &quot;Theresiental&quot;, today Teresva in Ukraine) and Munkács (German: &quot;Munkatsch&quot;, today Mukachevo in Ukraine).

The Carpathian Germans, like the Slovaks, were subjected to policies of Magyarization in the latter half of the 19th and the early the 20th century. Furthermore, many Carpathian Germans voluntarily magyarized their names to climb the social and economic ladder.

On 28 October 1918, the National Council of Carpathian Germans in Késmárk (German: &quot;Käsmark&quot;, today Kežmarok, Slovakia) declared their loyalty to the Kingdom of Hungary, but a Slovak group declared it to be part of Czechoslovakia two days later.

==First Czechoslovak Republic==
During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), Carpathian Germans had a specific political party, the Zipser German Party (1920–1938), led by Andor Nitsch, who was elected from 1925 to 1935 on a common Hungarian-German list for parliamentary elections. In 1929, the more nationalist-oriented Carpathian German Party (KdP) was formed in Bratislava, which later made a common list at the 1935 parliamentary elections with the Sudeten German Party; Konrad Henlein became its leader in 1937, with Franz Karmasin as deputy. In 1935, both parties obtained a seat in both parliamentary assemblies. In 1939, the KdP was renamed the German Party, with Franz Karmasin as führer, who had become in October 1938 state secretary for German Affairs in the Slovak Republic (1939–1945), led by Tiso.

The status of the Slovak Republic as a client state of Nazi Germany during World War II made life difficult for Carpathian Germans after the war. Nearly all remaining Germans had fled or were evacuated by the German authorities before the end of the war. Most Germans from Spiš were evacuated to Germany or the Sudetenland before the arrival of the Red Army. The evacuation was mostly the initiative of Adalbert Wanhoff and prepared the diocese of the German Evangelical Church between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945. The Germans from Bratislava were evacuated in January and February 1945 after long delays, and those of the Hauerland fled at the end of March 1945. The Red Army reached Bratislava on 4 April 1945.

== After World War II ==
After the war, one third of the evacuated or fugitive Germans returned to Slovakia. However on 18–19 June 1945, in the Přerov incident in Czechoslovakia, 71 men, 120 women and 74 children (265 Germans) who were Carpathian Germans from Dobšiná were murdered while they were passing through Horní Moštěnice, near Přerov railway station. After being taken out of the train by Czechoslovak soldiers, they were marched outside the city to a hill &quot;Švédské šance&quot;, where they were forced to dig their own graves and then were shot. The massacre did not become publicly known until the fall of the communist regime in 1989.

On 2 August 1945, Carpathian Germans lost the rights of citizenship, by Beneš decree no. 33, and they were interned in camps such as in Bratislava-Petržalka, Nováky, and in Krickerhau Handlová. In 1946 and 1947, about 33,000 people were expelled from Slovakia under the Potsdam Agreement, and around 20,000 persons were allowed or forced to remain in Slovakia because they were able, on petition, to use the &quot;Slovakisation&quot; process, which meant that they declared themselves as Slovaks and either changed their names to Slovak equivalents or simply Slovakized them, and others were simply forced to remain because their skills were needed. Out of approximately 128,000 Germans in Slovakia in 1938, only some 20,000 (15.6% of the prewar total) remained by 1947. The citizenship rules of the Beneš decrees were revoked in 1948 but not the expropriations.

== Today ==


According to national censuses, there were 6,108 (0.11%) Germans in Slovakia in 2007, 5,405 in 2001, 5,414 in 1991 and 2,918 in 1980. A Carpathian German Homeland Association has been created to maintain traditions, and since 2005, there is also a museum of culture of Carpathian Germans in Bratislava. There are two German-language media that are assisted financially by the Slovak government: &quot;Karpatenblatt&quot; (monthly) and &quot;IKEJA news&quot; (Internet). There is also minority broadcasting in German on the Slovak radio. After the war, their countrymen, now living in Germany and Austria, founded cultural associations as well. There is also a Carpathian German Landsmannschaft of North America.

Amongst prominent member ethnic Germans in postwar Slovakia is Rudolf Schuster, the country&#x27;s second president (1999–2004). Others e.g.
* Vladimír Weiss, a name shared by three generations of Slovak footballers
* Peter Sagan, Slovak international champion of bicycle race,
* Branislav Gröhling, Slovak minister of education
* Karol Šmidke, president of the Presidium of the Slovak National Council

=== Language ===

The isolation of the German from countries in which German has been standardised (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) has caused many obscure German dialects to continue to exist in Slovakia, but many are in danger of extinction.

In the Upper and Lower Zips regions (and later in Romania), the Zipser Germans spoke Zipserisch. A community of speakers remains in Hopgarten and speaks a distinctive dialect, &quot;Outzäpsersch&quot; (German: Altzipserisch, literally &quot;Old Zipserish&quot;). In Dobsina, they spoke what they called &quot;Dobschauisch&quot; or &quot;Topschauisch&quot;. In Metzenseifen (Medzev), they spoke Mantak, but only a few dozen people speak it today. The German schools were closed after World War II in all former German-speaking towns, and children were forced to learn Slovak. German was not to be used in the workplace or even publicly on the street.

== Historical demographics ==

The German minority in Slovakia has more or less always constantly been decreasing since the late 19th century onwards, according to the official Slovak national censuses. After 1947, their numbers gradually shrank even more in the wake of the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II.

== Outside Slovakia ==

The Carpathian and other German groups in Romania are currently represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (DFDR/FDGR). Carpathian/Zipser Germans are mostly to be found in Maramuresch (across the Rodna Mountains and within Maramureș County more specifically), Bukovina, and elsewhere sparsely throughout Transylvania. In general, in Maramureș, the Zipsers were colonised in mining areas.

The same applies for Bukovina, where Zipsers were also miners and lumberjacks. For example, in southern Bukovina (i.e. present-day Suceava County in northeastern Romania), several former Zipser German rural settlements include Iacobeni (), Cârlibaba (), and Fundu Moldovei ().

The Carpathian/Zipser Germans&#x27; settlements are located towards the Carpathian Mountains, westward in Bukovina and Suceava County. There were mostly mining communities. Today, sparse German communities still live in Bukovina/Suceava County, both Zipsers and Bukovina Germans, but their numbers are drastically dwindling.

In Maramureș, Vișeu de Sus () is still home to a small community of Zipser Germans (according to the 2011 Romanian census) who are also politically represented in the town&#x27;s council by one councillor stemming from the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (DFDR/FDGR).

<doc id="979334" wikidata="Q2336758" url="?curid=979334" title="Greenlight">
<text>In the context of the film and television industries, to greenlight is to give permission to proceed with a project. It specifically refers to formally approving its production finance and committing to this financing, thereby allowing the project to proceed from the development phase to pre-production and principal photography. The power to greenlight a project is generally reserved to those in a project or financial management role within an organization. The process of taking a project from pitch to green light formed the basis of a successful reality TV show titled &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;. The term is a reference to the green traffic signal, indicating &quot;go ahead&quot;. 

At the Big Five major film studios in the United States and the mini-majors, greenlight power is generally exercised by committees of the studios&#x27; high-level executives. However, the studio president, chairman, or chief executive is usually the person who makes the final judgment call. For the largest film budgets involving several hundred million U.S. dollars, the chief executive officer or chief operating officer of the studio&#x27;s parent media conglomerate may hold final greenlight authority. In practical terms, greenlight power in the 21st century at major film studios means the power to commit the studio to spending about US$100 million, on average, for a feature-length motion picture designated for wide release for the North American market. Historically, this power was exclusively held by white male executives in Hollywood, though the status quo has slowly begun to change since the turn of the 21st century. UCLA reported in 2020 that senior management teams at Hollywood film studios were 93 percent white and 80 percent male.

Studio executives weigh many factors when deciding whether to greenlight films, of which a few include: the film already has a bankable star or director attached; the film has a &quot;built-in audience&quot; because it is related to an existing media franchise; the story resonates with a wide audience, evokes passionate emotions, or causes viewers to lean forward in eager anticipation of whatever happens next; the hero is likable and relatable; the film can be marketed to all four quadrants; and the film can be distributed widely through multiple windows and into multiple international markets.

<doc id="979343" wikidata="Q281085" url="?curid=979343" title="Hey Ya!">
<text>&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; is a song by American hip hop duo Outkast, performed by its member André 3000, who wrote and produced the song. Along with &quot;The Way You Move&quot;, recorded by Outkast&#x27;s other member Big Boi, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was released by Arista Records as the second single from the duo&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;, on September 9, 2003. The track became a commercial success, reaching number one in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Norway, and Sweden. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; received critical acclaim upon release, and is consistently ranked as one of the greatest songs of the 2000s. The song was ranked number 10 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2021 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
André 3000 wrote &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; in 2000 and began work on recording it in December 2002 at Stankonia Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. He used an acoustic guitar for accompaniment, inspired by bands such as the Ramones, Buzzcocks, the Hives, and the Smiths.

André recorded the introduction, the first verse, the hook, and the vocals around the same time, using several dozen takes. He returned to work on the song several evenings later, with session musician Kevin Kendricks performing the bassline on the synthesizer. Months later, André 3000 worked with Pete Novak at the Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles. They experimented with various sound effects, including singing through a vocoder, and did 30 to 40 takes for each line.

==Composition==
&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; is a song in G major. Each cadential six-measure phrase is constructed using a change of meter on the fourth measure (creating a song with 22 quarter note beats per phrase) and uses a I–IV–V–VI chord progression. G major and C major chords are played for one and two measures, respectively. André 3000 then uses a deceptive cadence after a measure of the dominant D major chord, leading into two measures of an E major chord (against a G note in the melody implying E minor). The song moves at a tempo of 159 beats per minute, and André&#x27;s vocal range spans more than an octave and a half, from B3 to G5.

The song opens with three pick-up beats as André 3000 counts &quot;one, two, three, oh&quot; (with the &quot;oh&quot; on beat 1) and then leads into the first verse. The lyrics begin to describe the protagonist&#x27;s concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. He wonders if they are staying together just &quot;for tradition&quot;, as in the lines &quot;But does she really wanna [mess around] / But can&#x27;t stand to see me / Walk out the door?&quot; André 3000 commented, &quot;I think it&#x27;s more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world&#x27;s expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of how men and women relate to each other in the 2000s&quot;. The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line &quot;Hey ya!&quot; repeated eight times, accompanied by a synthesizer performing the bassline.

During the second verse, the protagonist gets cold feet and wonders what the purpose of continuing the relationship is, pondering the question, &quot;If they say nothing is forever...then what makes love the exception?&quot; After repeating the chorus, the song leads into a call and response section. André 3000 jokes, &quot;What&#x27;s cooler than being cool?&quot;, and the &quot;fellas&#x27;&quot; response, an overdubbed version of his vocals, is &quot;Ice cold&quot;, a reference to one of André Benjamin&#x27;s stage names. He then calls to the &quot;ladies&quot;, whose response is overdubbed from vocals by Rabeka Tuinei, who was an assistant to the audio engineer.

The song&#x27;s breakdown coined the phrase &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, a reference to a technique used by some photographers to &#x27;allegedly&#x27; expedite drying of damp instant film photos taken with film made by the Polaroid Corporation. It is an ongoing urban myth that shaking photos taken by the instant camera, dried faster. The breakdown also namechecks singer Beyoncé and actress Lucy Liu, in a turn of phrase alluding to the song &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which was performed by Destiny&#x27;s Child for the 2000 film adaptation of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, in which Liu starred. Though the line &quot;now all Beyoncés and Lucy Lius&quot; is meant to mean &quot;now all the independent women&quot;, André 3000 says he included the lyric because the music video for &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; was playing on his TV as he wrote &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;. The song closes by repeating the chorus and then gradually fading out.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the track as &quot;brilliantly rousing&quot; and &quot;spazzy with electrifying multiplicity&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; highlighted it as the catchiest song on the double album, and &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; identified it as one of the best songs in OutKast&#x27;s history. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; topped the 2003 Pazz &amp; Jop list, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau, with 322 mentions, beating runner-up Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; by 119. It was listed at number 15 on &quot;Blender&quot;″s 2005 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included it in its collection of &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;.

The song&#x27;s unusual arrangement drew comparisons to artists from a variety of genres. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; referred to it as the apex of the album and added that it successfully mixed Flaming Lips-style instrumentation with the energy of Prince&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;. Marcello Carlin of &quot;Uncut&quot; described the song as &quot;Andre going power pop with overtones of early-&#x27;80s electro; The Knack meet side one of The The&#x27;s &quot;Soul Mining&quot;.&quot;

Subsequently, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave it the number two slot in its &quot;The Top 100 Singles of 2000–2004&quot; feature in January 2005, bested only by OutKast&#x27;s own &quot;B.O.B.&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; described it as a mix of soul music by Ike Turner and new wave music by Devo and later as an &quot;electro/folk-rock/funk/power pop/hip-hop/neo-soul/kitchen sink rave-up&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared André 3000&#x27;s vocals to those of &quot;an indie-rock Little Richard&quot; and the backing arrangement to the Beatles&#x27; 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, later ranking it at number 182 in their list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and ranking it at number four on their 2011 list of the &quot;100 Best Songs of the Aughts&quot;.

&quot;New York&quot; also likened it to the Beatles and found it to be one of the best singles of 2003. AllMusic described it as an &quot;incandescent&quot; mix of electro, funk, and soul music. &quot;NME&quot; likened trying to classify the song as &quot;akin to trying to lasso water&quot; and described it as &quot;a monumental barney between the Camberwick Green brass band, a cruise-ship cabaret act, a cartoon gospel choir and a sucker MC hiccuping ″&quot;Shake it like a Polaroid pic-chaaaa!&quot;″ backed up by the cast of an amateur production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Sort of.&quot; In 2011, they placed it at number three on its list of the &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. In 2013, the sports website Grantland.com named it the best song of the millennium after a March-Madness style bracket of 64 songs. The music video of the same name was likewise well received by critics, who regarded it as a contemporary piece of post-industrial performance art. In 2014, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song at number 18 on their list of the 500 greatest songs of all time, and in 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number 10 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Commercial performance and impact==
&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was successful in North America, first charting on the week ending October 18, 2003, at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, three weeks after &quot;The Way You Move&quot; debuted; which was at number 25 at the time. It topped the Hot 100 for nine weeks, from December 13, 2003, to February 7, 2004. The digital sales topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Digital Tracks for 17 consecutive weeks. The song&#x27;s time at number one bridged two eras, ending Casey Kasem&#x27;s second tenure as host of &quot;American Top 40&quot; and beginning Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s tenure as host. The song performed well in urban contemporary markets, topping the Rhythmic Top 40 chart and reaching number nine on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks. It was also successful in mainstream music, topping the Top 40 Mainstream and Top 40 Tracks and reaching number 13 on the Adult Top 40. The song also crossed over to modern rock radio, and peaked at number 16 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart in December 2003. In 2004, Andre 3000 performed the song at The 2004 &quot;Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards&quot; and the song won the award for Favorite Song. Later in the year, the song appeared on the compilation album &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 16.&quot; It also appeared on the album &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! Number 1&#x27;s&quot; in 2006 as well as the &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Party Hits!&quot; album in 2007.

&quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was the first song on Apple&#x27;s iTunes to reach one million downloads and in September 2005, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the single platinum for shipping one million copies. At the 46th Grammy Awards, the song won Best Urban/Alternative Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year, but lost to Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Clocks&quot;.

The song also performed well in Europe. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number six on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three after 12 weeks, remaining on the chart for a total of 21 weeks. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; topped the Norwegian singles chart for seven weeks, and it reached the top in Sweden for the first week of 2004. It performed well across the continent, reaching the top ten in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; debuted at number 17 on Australia&#x27;s ARIA Singles Chart, and later topped the chart for two consecutive weeks. The song remained on the chart for 16 weeks and was certified 11× platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The song charted at number 61 for the 2003 end of year chart and was listed at number 15 on the 2004 chart and number five on the 2004 urban chart. It was also successful in New Zealand, reaching number two and staying on the RIANZ Singles Chart for 23 weeks.

The lyric &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, along with the song&#x27;s commercial success, helped to temporarily revitalize the Polaroid Corporation, which had declared bankruptcy in 2001. Because modern Polaroid film is sealed behind a clear plastic window, casually waving the picture has no effect on the film&#x27;s development. Vigorously shaking the film may actually distort the image by causing the film to separate prematurely and creating blobs in the final image. Nevertheless, Polaroid sought to capitalize on the allusion, hiring Ryan Berger of the Euro RSCG advertising agency. Polaroid sponsored parties for OutKast at which Euro RSCG distributed Polaroid cameras. OutKast also made a deal to hold Polaroid cameras during some of its performances. While Polaroid did not release sales figures, its public image, which was in decline with the growing popularity of digital cameras, was bolstered by the song. However, despite the welcome exposure, Polaroid eventually discontinued the sale of original Polaroid cameras and film, and again declared bankruptcy in 2008.

The song was used as the namesake of Pocoloco’s Stand ability in Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, part seven, “Steel Ball Run,” which debuted in 2004.

===Background===
The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Bryan Barber, is conceptually similar to the video for former Beatle&#x27;s Paul McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Coming Up&quot;, but is also based on the Beatles&#x27; landmark appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on February 9, 1964. However, it sets the action in London. The beginning and end of the video blend with those of &quot;The Way You Move&quot; so that the two can be watched in either order, and a &quot;The Way You Move/Hey Ya!&quot; video combining both clips with a bridging sequence was released on the &quot;OutKast: The Videos&quot; DVD.

After listening to the song, Barber was inspired to create a video around the Beatles&#x27; appearance on Sullivan&#x27;s show based on the song&#x27;s musical structure, but André 3000 had never seen this footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 and came up with the idea of reversing the British Invasion, by having the American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed using motion control photography in two days in August 2003 on a sound stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California. The cast included more than 100 women. Each of André 3000&#x27;s parts was shot several times from different angles, and he performed the song 23 times during the course of filming. Because releasing &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; as a single was a last-minute decision, André did not have time to choreograph the parts, and all of the dancing was improvised. Ice Cold 3000&#x27;s sequences were the first filmed, resulting in the character&#x27;s energetic performance, and Johnny Vulture&#x27;s were the last, so André, exhausted from the previous takes, sat on a stool for those sequences.

===Synopsis===

In the video, André 3000 plays all eight members of the fictional band The Love Below: keyboardist Benjamin André, bassist Possum Aloysius Jenkins, vocalist André &quot;Ice Cold&quot; 3000, drummer Dookie Blossom Gain III, three backing vocalists the Love Haters, and guitarist Johnny Vulture.

The video opens with the band&#x27;s manager Antwan (Big Boi) talking to Ice Cold and Dookie backstage. Meanwhile, the television presenter, portrayed by Ryan Phillippe (another version featured an energetic Phillippe), tries to calm a crowd of screaming girls on a show being broadcast live in black-and-white. Afterwards, he introduces the band and they start performing. While the girls in the audience scream loudly, one girl is carried off by security after rushing the stage, and another faints. A family is shown dancing to the broadcast at home. When Ice Cold instructs listeners to &quot;shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot;, some of the girls begin taking pictures and shaking them. Ice Cold dances with one of the girls on stage, and the video closes with several friends of the band watching and discussing the performance.

===Performance===
The video debuted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on September 5, 2003, at number 10. It topped the countdown for 19 days and retired at number eight on November 24, having spent 50 days on the program. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, the video won four awards for Video of the Year, Best Hip-Hop Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Art Direction. It was also nominated for Best Direction but lost to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;99 Problems&quot;. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; was nominated for Best Short Form Music Video at the 46th Grammy Awards, but it lost to Johnny Cash&#x27;s cover of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Hurt&quot;. In Canada, the video topped MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; for the week beginning January 30, 2004, and it won the award for Best International Video by a group at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards. In 2006, Stylus Magazine listed it at number 72 on its &quot;Top 100 Music Videos of All Time&quot;, comparing André 3000&#x27;s dancing to James Brown&#x27;s performances in the early 1970s.

==Release history==
==Cover versions==
The rock influences of &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; have allowed many other artists to release cover versions of the song. In 2006, Mat Weddle, frontman of the unsigned folk band Obadiah Parker, performed an acoustic cover of the song at a local open mic night, and a friend of his posted a video of the performance on YouTube, which quickly became virally popular online. Inspired by slowcore band Red House Painters, Weddle&#x27;s version moves at a much slower tempo backed by a rhythmic guitar strum and converts the breakdown into a &quot;staccato chime&quot;. The cover received international airplay and spawned many other acoustic versions.

An acoustic cover of the song, sung by Sam Lloyd in his role as Ted Buckland appeared in the 2009 episode of Scrubs titled My Soul On Fire, Part 2. In 2015, Postmodern Jukebox released a Scott Bradlee arrangement of &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; with a big band tempo and 1960s feel. Featuring Sara Niemietz on lead vocals, their version was featured in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Time&quot; magazine online, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

British alternative metal band Sleep Token released a cover in 2018 as a single. This version saw lead singer Vessel accompanied solely by piano and only included the first two verses and the chorus.

<doc id="979357" wikidata="Q5536774" url="?curid=979357" title="George Bartholomew (inventor)">
<text>George Bartholomew was an American inventor who is credited with the invention of concrete pavement. In 1886, Bartholomew moved to Bellefontaine, Ohio, after having learned about cement production. Bartholomew found a good source of limestone and clay in the area; from this, he hoped to create an artificial stone for paving. Bartholomew founded the Buckeye Portland Cement Company and set about developing a new cement for pavement.

In 1891, the Bellefontaine city council approved the use of Bartholomew&#x27;s invention for paving a test strip on Main Street outside the Logan County courthouse. This experiment proved successful, and the council approved the pavement of Court Avenue. A section of Court Avenue remains paved today with Bartholomew&#x27;s formula, celebrated as the first concrete paved street in America.

Bartholomew was honored for his invention at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois in 1893. His award was titled, &quot;First Place for Engineering Technology Advancement in Paving Materials.&quot; This award lent credibility to Bartholomew&#x27;s technique, and it was quickly adopted throughout the United States and internationally.

<doc id="979363" wikidata="Q441032" url="?curid=979363" title="Monika Beňová">
<text>Monika Beňová (born 15 August 1968) is a Slovak politician who has been a member of the European Parliament since 2004. She is a member of the centre-left Direction-Social Democracy party SMER-SD. SMER-SD is a member of the Party of European Socialists. She presently serves on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. At the same time she serves as a Quaestor of the European Parliament and therefore she is a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Bureau. In present she has opposite views as her mother party - Smer, for example on European Union, NATO, LGBTQ rights in Slovakia, conflict in Ukraine and so on.

She was recruited into politics in 1999, being one of the founding members of the Smer-SD party. Since then she has served in the National Council of the Slovak Republic as well as the European Parliament. She is known for her progressivism and left-wing views.

== Early life and education ==
Born Monika Beňová on 15 August 1968 in Bratislava, she attended upper secondary school at the Gymnazium Vazovova in Bratislava. In 2000, she enrolled in the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations at the Matej Bel University in Banská Bystrica. She graduated in 2005, with a master&#x27;s degree in international relations. She was awarded eastern Europe degree PhDr. in 2007.

== Early career ==
Before starting her political career, she directed several companies between 1992-1999, among them several stores. In early she was made director of a new private radio station in Bratislava named &quot;Radio Koliba&quot;, owned by her future-husband Fedor Flasik. The radio station was criticized at the time for having a pro-government agenda, as well trying to squeeze politically neutral competitors out of the market by overbidding and overspending them.

== Political career ==
In 1998, she was first approached with the idea of starting a political party by future prime minister Robert Fico, her future-husband Fedor Flasik and Frantisek Határ. As a result of these discussions, she co-founded and subsequently became vice-chairwoman of the new social-democratic party Direction-Social Democracy (Smer-SD), with Fico as leader.

Alongside others such as Fico, Robert Kalinak and Pavol Paska she was a part of the new generation of politicians hand-picked to start a new left-wing political party where the leadership would be without ties to the former communist regime nor post-communist corruption scandals, the so-called &quot;clean hands&quot; strategy. She was re-elected during the 2003 party congress.

Having been elected to the National Council of the Slovak Republic on 15 October 2002, she got involved in the Committee for European Integration, which she directed. After that she took part in the Joint Parliamentary Committee between the European Parliament and the Slovakian one. She was observer at the European Parliament from 2003 to 2004.

=== The European Parliament ===

In the European Parliament Elections of 2004, she became a member of the European Parliament. She was re-elected in the European Parliament Elections of 2009, receiving the most personal preference votes of any candidate in Slovakia. In the European Parliament, she was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the vice-chairwoman of the Delegation for Relations with Israel.

Ranked as one of the most active members of parliament, Flašíková-Beňová asked 19 written questions in 2014. Almost all of those questions were delivered on February 12 and covered a wide range of topics, including the bee shortage in the EU, the origin of meat in the EU, demonstrations in Egypt, changes to the law on Ukraine, new rules for tobacco products, energy poverty and rising electricity bills.
As for parliamentary speeches, Flašíková-Beňová mostly submits them in written form. Most recently she spoke, for instance, on the sound level of motor vehicles, rice imports from Bangladesh, in-vitro diagnostic medical devices, imports of timber and on vulnerable groups in Syria. During the 2009-2014 term, Flašíková-Beňová delivered one report as a rapporteur, on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union (2010–2011), in November 2012. She was re-elected to a third consecutive term in the 2014 European election.

Following the 2019 elections, Beňová became a quaestor of the European Parliament. Her role as quaestor made her part of the Parliament’s leadership under Presidents David Sassoli (2019–2022) and Roberta Metsola (since 2022).

=== Bid for mayorship of Bratislava ===
In 2006 Beňová was Smer-SD&#x27;s official candidate for the mayorship of Bratislava, but eventually lost out to the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) candidate Andrej Ďurkovský. In April 2013 she was nominated as the official candidate to run for the governorship of Bratislava Region. Prime Minister and Smer-SD chairman Robert Fico opined that Flašíková-Beňová would win, calling her a strong personality that would turn Bratislava Region upside down. In the end, Pavol Frešo, backed by Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKÚ), Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), Most-Híd, Party of Hungarian Community (SMK), Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), Civic Conservative Party (OKS) and Green Party, collected 74.2 percent of the vote and defeated Flašíková-Beňová who picked 25.8 percent.

== Personal life ==
Monika Flašíková-Beňová has been married twice. Her first husband died in 2004, and she married her second, businessman Fedor Flašík, on 20 May 2006. They divorced in 2017.

She subsequently amended her last name back to Monika Beňová. She has one son, named Martin, from her first marriage and one daughter, named Lea.

<text>Australia&#x27;s Federation Guard (AFG) is a tri-service ceremonial unit made up of members from the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force. Formed in 2000 for the centenary celebrations of Federation of Australia, it is the first purely ceremonial unit in the history of the Australian armed forces, and has since represented Australia in various roles both at home and around the world, including providing the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace in 2000.Since its inception AFG has supported many notable events;
The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoos held in Australia 2005, 2010 and 2019. 
The ANZAC commemorations in Western Europe 2014 to 2018. The Queen Elizabeth II Silver and Platinum Jubilee&#x27;s in the UK.
The Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Funeral in the UK 2022. The King Charles III Coronation in the UK 2023.

==Composition==

The posting strength of AFG varies, although the unit&#x27;s authorised strength is around 170 personnel of all ranks. A Royal Guard consists of 32 members from each service, one left marker, one right marker, two flag bearers and one parade officer. The Navy contingent of the Guard always appears on the left hand side of a parade, with Army in the centre and RAAF on the right. This reflects the seniority of the services.

Every member enlists into a specific trade in either the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army or Royal Australian Air Force, but puts those services on hold for the duration of their tenure of 2–3 years in AFG. Although formed initially for the celebrations of the centenary, the standard of the Guard was such that it was kept on as a showcase for the ceremonial capabilities of the Australian Defence Force, serving in various public duties capacities. Those task range from domestic to international Royal Guards, Half Guards, Credential Guards, Stair Guards, Catafalque parties, Military Funerals, Military parades and Precision Drill Team displays.

For administrative purposes the unit is divided into four sub-units, a headquarters element and three mixed service &quot;divisions&quot;. Each division is commanded by an officer from a different service.The Guard Commanding Officer is on a rotation of the services. Whilst the Guard Sergeant Major is Australian Army,

==Roles==
Although it is primarily a ceremonial guard unit, equipped with the L1A1 SLR, the Guard also provides gun salutes. These salutes can be performed anywhere, although for practical reasons are usually only utilised in the Canberra district. Depending on the situation personnel from all three services, operate up to six guns, with four to six personnel servicing each gun under the command of personnel from the Royal Australian Artillery.

AFG also contains a Drum Corps. Made up from volunteers from all three services posted to the unit, Drum Corps members participate in additional training with the majority having no previous musical experience with percussion instruments. Drum Corps members perform their drumming duties in addition to their traditional Guard duties and will often support the Precision Drill Team in their training and performances.

In 2000, AFG provided the Queen&#x27;s Guard at Buckingham Palace. In performing this duty, AFG was responsible not only for providing the first naval sentries (although the Royal Marines have in the past provided the guard, the Royal Navy have not), but also the first women to serve. The Guard alternated with the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, with each service providing a detachment on each day.

==Precision Drill Team==

Within AFG is a smaller group who form the Precision Drill Team (PDT). The PDT travel all over Australia performing for events like Careers Expos, charity functions and sporting events. The drills performed by the PDT are a combination of over 300 specific movements without any words of command being given to the Guardsmen. The Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen that make up the PDT require a high level of skill, concentration and teamwork which is perfected through many hours of practice.

==Uniforms==

Members of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force posted to the unit perform their ceremonial duties in the standard ceremonial uniforms of their service as the variance between trades is minimal. A notable addition to the uniform is the white &quot;airman&#x27;s belt&quot; worn by all other ranks.

For members of the Australian Army uniforms vary significantly between corps with embellishments differing between silver, gold and black. All corps have unique hat badges with some corps having individual unit hat badges, for example the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. The Guard is considered a &quot;non-corps posting&quot; by the Australian Army and wears &quot;non-corps&quot; generic army embellishments for the sake of uniformity. These generic embellishments consist of miniature Rising Sun badges worn in place of corps badges on the hat and collars, complemented by gold jacket buttons and rank insignia. A generic tri-service colour patch is worn by all Army members of the AFG as the unit colour patch.

A number of submissions have been made in relation to approving an official unit badge that would be worn on the hats of serving members but at this stage, none have been approved. However, an approved unit badge has been adopted by the unit and features the ADF tri-service crest in silver against a gold federation star.

==Musical support==
The Guard has the Australian Defence Force&#x27;s only dedicated drum corps. However, the Guard does not have its own band. The majority of musical support for ceremonial duties within the Canberra region is provided by the Band of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. When performing in other parts of Australia, other Defence bands such as the Royal Australian Navy Band, the Australian Army Band Corps or the Royal Australian Air Force Band are tasked for musical support.
