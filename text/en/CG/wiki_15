<doc id="977906" wikidata="Q576920" url="?curid=977906" title="International Conference on Population and Development">
<text>The United Nations coordinated an International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, on 5–13 September 1994. Its resulting Programme of Action is the steering document for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, infant mortality, birth control, family planning, the education of women, and protection for women from unsafe abortion services.

== Context and history ==
The first World Population Conference, organised by the League of Nations and Margaret Sanger, had been held at the Salle Central in Geneva, Switzerland from 29 August to 3 September 1927.

The first World Population Conference sponsored by the United Nations was held in 1954 in Rome, a second in 1965 in Belgrade, a third in 1974 in Bucharest, a fourth in 1984 in Mexico City.

== Advocacy and criticism ==
The conference received considerable media attention due to disputes regarding the assertion of reproductive rights. The Holy See and several predominantly Islamic nations were staunch critics, and U.S. President Bill Clinton received considerable criticism from conservatives for his participation, considering the fact that President Ronald Reagan did not attend or fund the previous conference held in Mexico City in 1984. The official spokesman for the Holy See was archbishop Renato Martino.

===Abortion===
During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term &#x27;reproductive health&#x27; in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference.
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the council&#x27;s commitment to promoting &#x27;reproductive health&#x27; did not include the promotion of abortion. 

Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

&quot;The term &#x27;reproductive health&#x27; was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of &#x27;reproductive health&#x27; to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.&quot;

With regard to the US, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the US delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:

&quot;Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.&quot;

Some years later, the position of the US Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by US Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that:
&quot;nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion&quot;. She added: &quot;There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition&quot;.

== Goals ==
According to the official ICPD release, the conference delegates achieved consensus on the following four qualitative and quantitative goals:
# Universal education: Universal primary education in all countries by 2015. Urge countries to provide wider access to women for secondary and higher-level education as well as vocational and technical training.
# Reduction of infant and child mortality: Countries should strive to reduce infant and under-5 child mortality rates by one-third or to 50–70 deaths per 1000 by the year 2000. By 2015 all countries should aim to achieve a rate below 35 per 1,000 live births and an under-five mortality rate below 45 per 1,000.
# Reduction of maternal mortality: A reduction by the 1990 levels by 2000 and of that by 2015. Disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups should be narrowed.
# Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning: Family-planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, and delivery should be made available. Active discouragement of female genital mutilation (FGM).

==Participants==
* National Black Women&#x27;s Reproductive Justice Agenda (1994)

== Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 ==
The 2019 Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 was held in Nairobi in November. It marks the 25th year of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). The government of Kenya, Denmark and UNFPA are co-convening the summit. It is a platform for all interested in the pursuit of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) which includes duty bearers, civil society organisations (CSOs), private sector organisation, women group, youth networks, faith base organisation etc. to discuss and agree on the actions to complete the ICPD Programme of Action.

<doc id="977909" wikidata="Q2602636" url="?curid=977909" title="Mohinder Amarnath">
<text>Mohinder Amarnath Bhardwaj (born 24 September 1950) is a former Indian cricketer and cricket analyst. He is the son of Lala Amarnath, the first post-independence captain of India. Mohinder was the vice captain of the Indian team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, where he was the player of the final. He was also a part of the Indian squad which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket.

Mohinder is commonly mentioned by players and cricket pundits as the best Indian batsman against express pace. In 2009, he received the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour Indian board can bestow on a former player.

==Early life==
Mohinder was born on 24 September 1950 in Patiala as the second eldest son of Lala Amarnath and Kailash Kumari. His elder brother, Surinder is a former international cricketer while his younger brother Rajinder is a former first-class cricketer. He also has two sisters, Kamala and Dolly. 

==Education==
Mohinder Amarnath did his schooling at MB High School Mandir Marg Delhi. He went to SGTB Khalsa College, Delhi University for his graduation.

==Career==
Mohinder made his debut against Australia at Chennai in December 1969,
as a quick-bowling all rounder. At his peak he was a top order batsman who mainly played at No. 3 for India, and was both an attacking and defensive batsmen who reinvented himself several times over the course of his career. He was also handy with the ball, bowling swingers and cutters with great skill and control. He had a unique run-up where he slowed down as he reached the bowling crease. Behind his seemingly lethargic demeanor were nerves of steel.

Mohinder Amarnath played 69 Tests scoring 4,378 runs at a batting average of 42.50, with 11 hundreds and 24 fifties, and claimed 32 wickets at a bowling average of 55.68 apiece. In 85 One Day Internationals, he scored 1,924 runs at an average of 30.53 and a highest score of 102 n.o. and claimed 46 wickets at 42.84 apiece.

==Accolades==

Fiery fast bowlers Imran Khan of Pakistan and Malcolm Marshall of West Indies have praised his batsmanship, courage and ability to endure and master pain. In 1982–83 Mohinder played 11 Test matches against Pakistan (5) and the West Indies (6) and scored over 1000 runs in the two series.

In his book &quot;Idols&quot;, Indian legend and compatriot Sunil Gavaskar described Mohinder Amarnath as the finest batsman in the world.

Mohinder made his first test century at Perth at the WACA (the fastest and bounciest wicket in the world) batting against Jeff Thomson. He followed this test century with another 10 more against top class fast bowling.

Imran Khan regarded Mohinder so highly that in his book &quot;All Round View&quot; he went on record to say that in the 1982–83 season, Mohinder was quite simply the best batsman in the world. Imran further went on to state that Mohinder should have played non-stop for India right from his debut in 1969 to the time he retired. (After his debut series in 1969, he had to wait until 1975 to make it into the team).

==1982–83 series in Pakistan==

This series saw Imran Khan at his lethal best, supported by the canny Sarfraz Nawaz. In match after match India crumbled against the fiery pace of Pakistan, losing the Second, third and fourth tests 3–0 . Imran Khan who took 40 wickets in the series was jointly awarded &quot;Man of the Series&quot; with Mohinder Amarnath. The catastrophic series for India hastened the end of the career of master batsman Gundappa Viswanath. Mohinder Amarnath was the sole saving grace for the Indian batting line-up for the series as a whole. (An aside – Sunil Gavaskar carried his bat in one innings of the series. Sunil Gavaskar scored 434 runs ).

==1983 World Cup Performance==

Mohinder Amarnath is noted for his performance in the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He was awarded &quot;Man of the Match&quot; in the final and semi-final, playing a star role in leading India to their first ever One Day International title and first World Cup win.

In the semi-final against England his accurate seam bowling fetched him the top-order wickets of David Gower and Mike Gatting. He gave away only 27 runs in his 12 overs, for an average of a miserly 2.25 an over, the lowest among all Indian bowlers. Returning to bat, he scored 46 runs to give India a solid foundation. He was named the Man of the Match.

In the final, India batted first against the West Indies which arguably boasted the world&#x27;s best bowling attack comprising Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Joel Garner. India did not fare well, with the entire team being dismissed for a paltry score of 183 in 54.4 overs, well short of the allotted 60 overs. Amarnath&#x27;s calm and composed batting against West Indian fast bowling gave the Indian innings some much needed stability. He occupied the crease for the longest period (80 balls) and scored 26 runs. Though normally in limited over matches a long stint at the crease is not necessarily a good thing, given that India did not last the entire 60 overs Amarnath&#x27;s innings gave the batsmen at the other end the opportunity to score. Krishnamachari Srikkanth top-scored with 38 runs, followed by Sandeep Patil (27 runs). After the poor batting performance India&#x27;s chances were deemed almost non-existent. However, the Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions, conducive for swing bowling perfectly to bowl out the West Indies for just 140, thus winning the finals by 43 runs. Amarnath and Madan Lal were the joint highest wicket takers with 3 wickets each. As he had been in the semi-final, Amarnath was once again the most economical bowler, conceding only 12 runs in his 7 overs for an average of 1.71 per over. Again, just like the semi-final, Amarnath was declared the Man of the Match. Amarnath also had the distinction of bagging the match winning wicket. As the vice-captain of the team, he held the World Cup aloft in a famous photograph along with his captain and friend, Indian cricketing legend Kapil Dev.

==Trials and tribulations==

Except for the period 1982–83, Mohinder never held a steady place in the Indian Test side and would frequently get dropped. Mohinder is known as the &quot;Comeback Man of Indian Cricket&quot;. During his two decades at the top, he was dropped from the Indian side on several occasions and each time he fought his way back with sterling performances, playing excellent domestic cricket and making it hard for the national selectors to ignore him.

He was well known for his batting technique, temperament and skill. He even experimented with a side-on batting stance, where one foot was placed at an angle to the crease, giving the body had a more open stance with a better view of the bowler.

==Character and Courage==

Amarnath was noted for his personality, courage and determination. West Indian cricketing great Vivian Richards called him &quot;one of the nicest men to have ever played the game&quot; and former Australian Test opening batsman David Boon said &quot;Concede didn&#x27;t seem to be in his vocabulary&quot;.

Gideon Haigh writing in The Age says: &quot;In an era replete with fast bowling and unrestricted in use of the bouncer, he never stopped hooking – despite many incentives to do so. He received a hairline fracture of the skull from Richard Hadlee, was knocked unconscious by Imran Khan, had teeth knocked out by Malcolm Marshall and was hit in the jaw so painfully by Jeff Thomson in Perth that he could eat only ice cream for lunch. &#x27;What separated Jimmy from the others,&#x27; Michael Holding said, &#x27;was his great ability to withstand pain . . . A fast bowler knows when a batsman is in pain. But Jimmy would stand up and continue.&#x27; &quot;.

In the Bridgetown Test during India&#x27;s tour of the West Indies in 1982–83, Amarnath had to retire for stitches after being hit on the head. On returning to the game, he faced one of history&#x27;s most lethal fast bowlers Michael Holding. It was a given that Holding would try to intimidate Amarnath by bowling a bouncer, and indeed he did so. While most would expect that a batsman in such a situation would do the prudent thing and duck, instead Amarnath stood his ground and hooked the ball to the boundary. However the West Indies bowling attack comprising Malcolm Marshall at his best, Michael Holding, Winston Davis and Wayne Daniel would wreak their most lethal vengeance upon Amarnath during their 1983/84 tour of India by restricting him to only 1 run in six innings, during which Holding scalped Amarnath three times for a duck. Amarnath had scores of 0,0,0,1,0,0 and was hence dropped just months after his career-high success at the 1983 World Cup.

He played an important role in famous chase in Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1976 tour. He made 85 in the second innings taking India to the brink of historic win.

Amarnath was noted for his conflicts with the Indian cricketing political establishment, famously having called the selectors a &quot;bunch of jokers&quot;. This often resulted in his exclusion from the Indian team also.

==Trivia==

Mohinder had some unique dismissals. He is the only Indian who has been dismissed on handling the ball. He was dismissed on 9 February 1986 also making him the first one to be dismissed for handling the ball in One-Day Internationals. He is also the only Indian to be dismissed for obstructing the field in One-Day Internationals. He has also been dismissed &#x27;hit wicket&#x27;.

He is the only International Cricketer in the world to be given out both for handling the ball and obstructing the field in his career

He displayed the unique superstition of carrying a red handkerchief visibly in his trouser pocket while batting.

==Cricket Coaching==
Mohinder Amarnath presented a popular weekly cricket coaching TV programme in the late 80s/early 90s. The program went by the name of &#x27;Cricket with Mohinder Amarnath&#x27;. It featured technique presentation and discussion with guest speakers who were mostly Indian national team members at the time. It had a decent following among the youth of that time who were hooked to Cricket especially after Reliance Cup was held in India in 1987, given that the program was available on the national channel Doordarshan thus taking cricket to the masses. The title song of this program &#x27;Khel hi hain hamara jeevan...&#x27; was very catchy. Young Sachin Tendulkar, a 15 years old, was interviewed by Amarnath for the program. Sachin was playing wonderfully in the domestic leagues, and was showing enormous potential. After a year, he was inducted into the Indian team for the Pakistan tour.

==Personal life==
Mohinder Amarnath is married to Inderjit Amarnath, and they have one daughter.

==In popular culture==
The 2021 Hindi film &quot;83&quot;, based on India&#x27;s 1983 World Cup victory, features Saqib Saleem as Amarnath, and Amarnath himself as his father, Lala. Amarnath had played the role of a cricket coach in the 2016 film &quot;Dishoom&quot;, in which he co-starred Saleem.

<doc id="977912" wikidata="Q3526364" url="?curid=977912" title="Derek Underwood">
<text>Derek Leslie Underwood (8 June 1945 – 15 April 2024) was an English international cricketer. In retirement he became president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2008.

Through much of his career, Underwood was regarded as one of the best bowlers in Test cricket. Although classified as a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, Underwood bowled at around medium pace. He was often unplayable on seaming English wickets, particularly sticky wickets, earning his nickname &#x27;Deadly&#x27;.

Underwood was a first-class bowler from his teens and took his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th first-class wicket in 1971, aged only 25. Only George Lohmann and Wilfred Rhodes had secured a thousand wickets at an earlier age. His England career ended when he went on the rebel tour to South Africa, finishing his Test career with 297 wickets.

On 16 July 2009, Underwood was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==Early life and county career==
Underwood was born in Bromley Maternity Hospital, the second son of Leslie Frank Underwood and Evelyn Annie Wells. His early days were spent watching his father, a right-arm medium pace bowler, play for Farnborough Cricket Club, where elder brother Keith also played. Underwood was educated at Beckenham and Penge Grammar School for Boys and in 1961 he took all ten wickets for the school&#x27;s first XI, of which his brother was the captain, against Bromley Grammar School.

Underwood played county cricket for Kent, making his first-class debut against Yorkshire aged 17 in 1963. He became the youngest player to take 100 County Championship wickets in a debut season. He went on to take 100 wickets in a season a further nine times. His batting was less accomplished, averaging barely over ten runs per innings in 676 matches. He remained at Kent for 24 years, the whole of his first-class career.

Underwood made his only first-class century for Kent against Sussex in 1984 aged 39, having batted as a nightwatchman.

==Test career==
Underwood took the last four Australian wickets in 27 balls in the final half an hour at the end of the fifth Test in 1968, after a heavy thunderstorm on the fifth day had all but ended the match, to square an Ashes series that Australia were winning 1–0. He was named in 1969 as one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year. Underwood also toured Australia in 1970–71, dismissing Terry Jenner to win the seventh Test at Sydney, and regain the Ashes.

According to the retrospective ICC Test bowler rankings, Underwood was ranked number 1 in the world from September 1969 to August 1973. He reached a peak rating of 907 after his 12-wicket haul against New Zealand in the 1971 series. He was England&#x27;s leading wicket taker with spin.

Underwood was noted for his consistent accuracy, and his inswinging arm ball was particularly noted for dismissing batsmen leg before wicket. Keith Dunstan wrote that he was &quot;inclined to wear a hole in the pitch by dropping the ball on the same spot ...&quot;.

Underwood used to say that bowling was a &quot;low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there&#x27;s a mistake&quot;, and sooner or later every batsman would make a mistake.

==World Series Cricket and rebel South African tour==
Underwood was one of six England cricketers (the others being John Snow, Alan Knott, Dennis Amiss, Bob Woolmer and Tony Greig), to feature in Kerry Packer&#x27;s World Series Cricket in the late 1970s.

He also went on the rebel tour South Africa in 1981–82, bringing his England career to an end as it was in defiance of the sporting ban against the apartheid state. For this he and the other rebels were banned from international cricket for three years.

==Later career==
Underwood was almost unplayable on damp wickets, but on dry tracks he would often push the ball through a little quicker and flatter, not wanting to risk being hit over his head, which he always hated. 

At the age of 39, he scored his first and only first-class century (111), in his 591st first-class match in July 1984. It was played at Hastings, a favourite bowling haunt for Underwood who, having gone in to bat as nightwatchman, finally reached the hundred mark in his 618th first-class innings. The cricket writer Colin Bateman noted, &quot;there was no more popular century that summer&quot;.

Underwood retired from cricket in 1987, at the age of 42, having taken 2,465 wickets at a little over 20 apiece.

==Recognition==
Underwood was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1981 New Year Honours for services to cricket.

In 1997, he became patron of the Primary Club, and in 2008 it was announced that he would serve as president of MCC for the following year.

In a &quot;Wisden&quot; article in 2004, he was selected as a member of England&#x27;s greatest post-war XI.

Underwood was appointed an honorary fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.

==Personal life==
Underwood married Dawn Sullivan in October 1973 and they had two daughters.

Underwood became a consultant for ClubTurf Cricket Limited, joining his brother Keith who had become managing director. 

On 15 April 2024, Underwood died from complications of dementia at the age of 78. Richard Thompson, chair of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said that &quot;Underwood will be remembered as one of the finest spin bowlers this country has ever produced, and his remarkable record is testament to his enduring skill.&quot;

<doc id="977913" wikidata="Q7258300" url="?curid=977913" title="Puddle (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Puddle is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in February 1952.

Since 1936, Escher&#x27;s work had become primarily focused on paradoxes, tessellation and other abstract visual concepts. This print, however, is a realistic depiction of a simple image that portrays two perspectives at once. It depicts an unpaved road with a large pool of water in the middle of it at twilight. Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon overhead. The road is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks. Escher has thus captured three elements: the water, sky and earth.

<text>Bruce Victor Beaver (14 February 1928 – 17 February 2004) was an Australian poet and novelist.

==Biography==
Beaver was born in Manly, New South Wales. He was educated at the Manly Public School and at the Sydney Boys&#x27; High School. He worked at a number of jobs, as a cow farmer, in radio, as a wages clerk, a surveyor&#x27;s labourer, fruit-picker, proof-reader and journalist, before deciding to write full-time. From 1958 to 1962, he lived in New Zealand and Norfolk Island.

In 1961 Beaver&#x27;s first book of poetry was published. He wrote his first poem in response to the dropping of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima, and continued to write even while working as a labourer. Thanks to his marriage, he was able to become a full-time writer. Even though he suffered from bipolar disorder, Beaver was able to continue writing until close to his death in 2004.

When asked to list their favourite books, Dorothy Porter named Bruce Beaver and is quoted as saying:

<text>Gravitation (also known as Gravity) is a mixed media work by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher completed in June 1952. It was first printed as a black-and-white lithograph and then coloured by hand in watercolour.

It depicts a nonconvex regular polyhedron known as the small stellated dodecahedron. Each facet of the figure has a trapezoidal doorway. Out of these doorways protrude the heads and legs of twelve turtles without shells, who are using the object as a common shell. The turtles are in six coloured pairs (red, orange, yellow, magenta, green and indigo) with each turtle directly opposite its counterpart.

<doc id="977921" wikidata="Q501174" url="?curid=977921" title="Dayparting">
<text>In broadcast programming, dayparting is the practice of dividing the broadcast day into several parts, in which a different type of radio programming or television show appropriate for that time period is aired. Television programs are most often geared toward a particular demography, and what the target audience typically engages in at that time.

==North America==
===On radio===
Nielsen Audio (known as Arbitron until it merged with Nielsen Holdings in 2013), the leading audience measurement service in the United States, divides a weekday into five dayparts: morning drive time (6:00–10:00 a.m.), midday (10:00 a.m.–3:00 p.m.), afternoon drive (3:00–7:00 p.m.), evenings (7:00 p.m.–midnight) and overnight (midnight–6:00 a.m.).

In radio broadcasting through most of the 1990s, dayparting was also used for censorship purposes. Many songs that were deemed unsuitable for young listeners were played only during the late evening or overnight hours, when children were presumably asleep. Even today, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) dictates less stringent decency requirements for programming aired between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. local time.

The drive time dayparts coincide with rush hour; these dayparts are traditionally the most listened-to portions of the schedule, since these are the times when most people are in their cars, where vehicle audio remain nearly ubiquitous. Most stations (both talk and music) air local programming in one or both drive time slots. The midday, or &quot;at work&quot; slot, has in recent years become particularly prone to voice-tracking, as large station ownership groups cut costs and use supposedly local DJs at multiple stations (often in different time zones). Music stations often are careful not to repeat songs during the midday shift, as they generally have a captive audience, and will often use &quot;9 to 5 No Repeat Workdays&quot; and all-request or specialty lunch hours to lure listeners and air a broader variety of music. Evenings are a popular time for syndicated programs, while overnights are generally automated, either with or without a voice-tracked DJ, though there are a few niche programs that target special audiences in the overnight and early morning hours (&quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot; and The &quot;National Farm Report&quot;, among them). On weekends, music stations often air syndicated programming, without regard to time slots (though Saturday nights often remain live with either local or syndicated hosts, especially on oldies and country music stations, to take requests) and talk stations air niche network shows or brokered programming. Religious programming often airs on Sunday mornings.

In talk radio, where voice tracking is impossible and syndicated content is live and national, these lines blur somewhat. &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; aired in a time slot that is in midday in all time zones, but other than that and overnight shows such as &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, a show that airs in a slot corresponding to afternoon drive time in the Pacific Time Zone (for instance, &quot;The Lars Larson Show&quot;) would fall into a less-listened-to evening time slot on the East Coast. Similarly, a show that airs during early midday on the East Coast (such as the &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot;) would be aired during the morning drive time period on the West Coast, and may not live up to the expectations of listeners expecting local, informative content. The general solution for this problem is to broadcast delay programming to fit schedules, though another problem develops where West Coast listeners are unable to interact with those programs unless they stream them live from a station east of them, or they have a live video simulcast via a television channel or streaming services.

===On television===
In the United States, dayparting is by far the most common among the Big Three television networks (ABC, NBC and CBS), all three of which continue to produce programming for a wide array of audiences (a programming strategy known as full-service radio). This is also generally true of other countries where the major terrestrial broadcasters have more general audiences.

Cable and satellite channels, most of which cater to smaller niche audiences, generally use much simpler programming strategies: infomercials in the morning, rerun (often in block programming or marathon format) in the daytime, and feature programming in prime time, replayed in late night (though this structure varies, some channels may opt not to lease out certain time periods to infomercials and program overnight and morning time periods with entertainment programs instead). United States cable news outlets typically program a network-style morning show, rolling news coverage in the daytime with opinion programming or long-form documentaries at night; ESPN follows a similar format, but with sporting events in prime time, while its opinion programs air primarily on sister outlet ESPN2. Stations such as MTV, BET and VH1 that feature music programming may devote their morning and/or midday blocks to music videos. Children&#x27;s channels such as Disney Channel and Nickelodeon generally air programs for preschool children during the early morning hours in the form of blocks such as Nick Jr. and Disney Junior, PBS carries a similar lineup called PBS Kids, while broadcast networks carry syndicated content; some air older programs (such as reruns of classic cartoons such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; on Cartoon Network) at midday while children are at school, while programs for older school-age children and high school-aged teenagers air in the late afternoon slot. During prime time, programs that are generally aimed at the entire family (such as movies, which Disney Channel often airs) are common. Cartoon Network switches from children&#x27;s programming content later in the evening to carry adult-oriented live-action/animation block Adult Swim, which runs through late night.

====Daytime====
On television, like on radio, the day is divided into similar dayparts, although the times have been blurred somewhat. In general, breakfast television programs air between 7:00 and 10:00 a.m.; on television network, these are usually long-form news programs featuring entertainment, light fare and features aimed toward women. Until the 1970s or so, children&#x27;s programs such as &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; aired in this time slot (since that time, however, the school day has started earlier, making such programs less viable).

After breakfast comes daytime television, which targets college students, older retirees and the ever-shrinking base of stay-at-home moms and housewives; the soap opera, tabloid talk show, court show and (much more rarely since the 1990s) the game show are popular genres in this daypart. In the United States and Canada, a local midday news broadcasting also airs during the noon hour on most stations as well (this is not always the case; some stations may schedule their midday newscasts up to one hour earlier). PBS and other noncommercial public broadcasting networks generally broadcast educational programs aimed at children, especially toddlers and preschool children (such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) throughout the early and later part of the daytime slot, while some show other alternative programs such as cooking programs during the midday period. Cable and satellite television networks generally broadcast an occasional movie during the daytime slot or acquired programs during prime time.

The later part of the daytime slot can sometimes be targeted at children ages 7–12 and teenagers ages 13–16 when they come home from school. The U.S. networks Fox and The WB had children&#x27;s program blocks during the mid-1990s into the early 2000s, and even prior to that, CBS&#x27;s &quot;Match Game&quot; exploited this audience to set ratings records in the 1970s. PBS traditionally broadcasts educational children&#x27;s programs until approximately 5:00 p.m. in most areas, some PBS stations broadcast children&#x27;s programs until 6:00 p.m., and some even until 7:00 p.m..

From 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. (in the United States, this can sometimes be as early as 4:00 p.m.), newscasts are usually shown on most television stations. Local news is usually coupled with a half-hour network newscast and possibly a syndicated news program. Unlike morning news shows, these are more generally targeted programs and feature more hard news stories (network evening newscasts, unlike their local counterparts, tend to limit weather and sports coverage unless it is a notable news story). In the United States, stations affiliated with minor networks, or those that have no network affiliation at all, usually air syndicated sitcom reruns or continue daytime programming during this daypart. Following the news, prime time begins with what is usually referred to as the &quot;fringe time&quot; or &quot;access period&quot; (so named after the Prime Time Access Rule, former legislation in the United States which previously &quot;required&quot; networks to not show network-supplied programming in that hour). In the United States (and Canada, to a certain extent), two game shows, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; have dominated this time slot since the 1980s, and they usually compete with syndicated entertainment newspaper magazines (such as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;) and syndicated reruns of popular primetime programming like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. Additional local newscasts have become increasingly popular in this time slot.

====Evening====
Prime time is the highest-profile television daypart, from 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., depending on the network and time zone. The highest rated programs on television often air during prime time, and almost all scripted programming (except soap operas, game shows, and more recently, sketch comedy shows) air during the prime time slots. Occasionally, especially during the 1980s and in the 2000s, programs that were &quot;daytime oriented&quot; sometimes enter the prime time daypart, such as the popular nighttime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; and the game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. Usually the main reason for the high profile of prime time television is due to the fact that many people who come home from work and school tend to watch television rather than engage in any other activity.

In North America, Friday nights are often considered to be the &quot;Friday night death slot&quot;, due to the concept that many shows scheduled on or moved to Friday nights would not last long before cancellation due to low ratings. Some shows have achieved success on Fridays even with the notion of the &quot;death slot&quot; (examples include CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot;, programs within the now-defunct TGIF lineup, and more recently &quot;Shark Tank&quot;, both aired on ABC in the U.S.). Other &quot;death slots&quot; include Saturday nights, the 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m. weekday time slots (at least during the 1980s; both time slots have since been abandoned by all networks and given to local news or syndication), and the time slot or slots immediately opposite popular shows such as &quot;American Idol&quot; or the Super Bowl (see also &quot;Super Bowl counterprogramming&quot;). The phenomenon of fewer viewers on Friday and Saturday is in part because most people (particularly the younger viewers that advertisers often seek) are usually not home to watch television on Friday and Saturday nights as they participate in leisure activities on those days, and as a result, programs that air during this time usually receive low ratings. However, some cable channels aimed at children, teenagers or preadolescence audiences (such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel) have experienced success with original programs that they commonly air in the perceived Friday and Saturday night death slots; Nickelodeon in particular, has aired first-run teen programs during Saturday prime time since 1992 with the creation of the SNICK block (later renamed TeenNick from 2004 to 2009), as well as ABC&#x27;s &quot;TGIF&quot; block from the 1980s and &#x27;90s.

Following prime time, late-local news often air, followed by late night television programs. Late-night shows are predominantly targeted toward younger male audiences (college students and people who suffer from insomnia are also a large audience for late night programs) and feature a common format of a male host delivering a stand-up comedy routine (known as a monologue) centered around current events, followed by several guests and a house band&#x27;s performance.

====Overnight====
After the late night shows, programming varies; this time slot between approximately 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. is known as overnight (or the &quot;graveyard slot&quot; due to the extremely low numbers of viewers). This daypart is the only portion of the day not monitored or reported on by Nielsen in the U.S. in most circumstances, although many stations still consider this a viable programming daypart and actively sell breaks. Some stations may sign-on and sign-off for the night (though this has become less common since the 1980s), air infomercial, or air news or reruns of other programming. It is also often used as a timeslot to &quot;burn off&quot; (air programming the station is required to run) shows the station is contractually obligated to run but is not concerned with viewership, often after an announced cancellation or poor ratings performance. This daypart can also be used to air programming intended to be recorded via DVR and watched later (&quot;time shifting&quot;), or a spot to air programming preempted from another daypart due to breaking news, live sports, or other program interruptions. Many stations run rebroadcasts of local late news broadcasts at 2:00 a.m., with visual disclaimers that indicate the programming is pre-recorded. In many areas, PBS member stations may also air encores of children&#x27;s programs on a digital subchannel at this time.

In some countries, programming aimed at adult audiences may also air during the late night hours, such as softcore pornography. In the United States, a handful of cable television channels such as Cinemax and AXS TV have used this practice, but this is forbidden on American broadcast television. An exception to this is if the broadcast signal is encrypted; this allowed pay television that transmitted over broadcast television in the 1970s and 1980s such as ONTV to air pornographic films at night. Until the end of the 1990s (for example BBC One by November 1997) most TV stations around the world would sign-off between around midnight and 3am local time, and showed a test card until the sign-on in the morning. Most often at the main public stations (like BBC1 in Britain) showed the national anthem before closing down.

====Weekends====
Weekends have a slightly different setup than weekdays. On Saturdays, morning shows share time with the saturday-morning cartoon, where the networks usually fulfill federally mandated regulations requiring the airing of educational or children&#x27;s shows (such as regulations on children&#x27;s television programming in the United States, where at least three hours of this programming must air weekly across all television stations; although most of the children&#x27;s programs have increasingly become more live action in nature than animated). Sunday mornings, often known as a graveyard slot (particularly very early on Sunday morning) feature more morning shows, public affairs designed for very small audiences, additional infomercials, religious broadcasting, and a series of influential political and news analysis/interview programs known as the Sunday morning talk show.

Weekend afternoons (both Saturday and Sunday) often feature different sporting events to varying degrees. During the fall, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC in the United States all broadcast football (all four networks air college football and NFL football), the NBA airs on ABC, college basketball airs on CBS, Fox and ABC during the winter and spring, while the NHL airs on ABC during this time period. Golf (on NBC And CBS), auto racing (NBC and Fox for NASCAR, though NBC sometimes airs IndyCar racing) and baseball (Fox) occur during the summer; in addition, sports anthology series such as the &quot;CBS Sports Spectacular&quot;, Canada&#x27;s &quot;CBC Sports Saturday&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; broadcast a broad variety of sports with a smaller following. Most stations also find time when sports are not airing to air large blocks of infomercials and some syndicated programs during this time slot. Cable networks and some broadcast stations frequently air feature films during weekend afternoons.

In North America, not many new programs air on Saturday nights, with the focus more on movies, reruns and sports. This is largely due to the increasing status of Saturday prime time as a &quot;death slot&quot;, which led most American broadcast networks to abandon first-run scripted fare on that night by the mid-2000s. In Canada, CBC Television has historically aired Saturday night NHL ice hockey nationally under the title &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, dating back to the early days of radio. Other Canadian networks use the Saturday night slot to meet Canadian content quotas (a practice colloquially known as the &quot;Canadian content&quot;). The U.S.-based Fox network established a permanent sports block on Saturday night in 2012, carrying a range of sports including Pac-12 Conference Fox College Football, Major League Baseball on Fox, NASCAR on Fox and the Fox UFC on a periodic basis with reruns airing when sports events are not scheduled (this block displaced Fox&#x27;s reality series &quot;Cops&quot; from its time slot of over two decades); ABC carries Saturday Night Football during the fall, then switches to a mix of NBA on ABC, movies, news magazines and prime time reruns for the rest of the year.

In the U.S., late night programming on Saturday features one prominent sketch comedy show, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, while other stations carry syndicated reruns. Sunday evening is generally treated as a regular weeknight, with popular prime time programs airing. In the United States and Canada, prime time network programs start one hour earlier on Sunday evenings (6:00 or 7:00 p.m., depending on the time zone) than on Monday through Saturdays, an exception to the since-repealed Prime Time Access Rule as part of a 1975 revision that allowed networks to program the time slot on Sundays. No network programming currently airs in the Sunday late night slot.

==United Kingdom==
Weekdays on the major British channels generally consist of breakfast programming (on BBC One, ITV and Channel 5) or comedy programmes (on Channel 4), followed by game shows, soap operas and lifestyle programmes during the day. Channel 4 has also had consistent success with late-afternoon game shows; &quot;Countdown&quot;, airing daily since the network&#x27;s launch, has been one of the network&#x27;s most popular programs.

In the UK, Saturday night prime time is usually devoted to entertainment programming such as reality talent shows such as &quot;The X Factor&quot; or &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on ITV and &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; on the BBC or drama programmes such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; on the BBC. Unlike other regions, such as the United States and Canada, some programs aired during Saturday primetime in the UK achieve strong viewership levels. ITV and BBC both have long-running traditions of broadcasting a flagship television show on Sunday evenings. Examples include &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Poldark.&quot; In recent years, long-running classic dramas have been increasingly broadcast during primetime, often more than 1 time per week. Primetime generally starts and finishes earlier (6pm to 10pm starting times). Primetime&#x27;s two main slots are the 8pm and 9pm shows, whilst 7pm and 6pm shows are often popular shows and 10pm showings being for shows of a more adult nature, though not necessarily explicit. Adult shows such as explicit and horror programs are usually shown on second channels (ITV2 and BBC Two) as soon as Ofcom allows, rather than in the small hours like in some countries. There are also many channels largely dedicated to replaying now-axed popular shows from the past, such as &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, &quot;The Bill&quot;, &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; and &#x27;classic&#x27; &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

==Australia==
In Australia, dayparting is not as complex. The breakfast television slot is generally seen as 6:00 to 9:00 a.m., although two of the three major networks have begun morning news programmes at 5:00 a.m. since 2010. Morning television follows which often involves a &#x27;light news/talk&#x27; show, sometimes featuring advertorial. The daytime television slot adjoins the morning slot, lasting from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Various repeated shows and movies are often aired, along with imported programs such as &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

The early fringe occurs in the late afternoon/early evening, from 4:00 to 7:30 p.m., with children&#x27;s programming having been shown in the early part of the time period until 2012, as well as afternoon and evening news and public affairs shows at 4:00, 5:00, 6:00 and 6:30 p.m., depending on the channel. Locally produced game shows such as &quot;The Chase Australia&quot; and &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; air at 5:00 p.m. across two channels. At 7:00 p.m., one channel airs public affairs Program&quot; A Current Affair&quot;, while another airs an Australian soap, &quot;Home and Away&quot;, and the third airs a light news/talk show.

Primetime is officially, in terms of ratings figure designations, from 6:00 p.m. until midnight, however the peak audiences are between 6:00 and 10:30 p.m. Primetime programming is advertised as starting from 7:30 p.m., with more family-friendly programs airing during this time, until classification restrictions allow for racier content from 8:30 p.m. There is a small audience drop off at 9:30 p.m., and a significant audience drop off after 10:30 p.m., with not much promotion given to programmes airing after this time. Late local news programmes only air on one of the three networks. As a result, the late fringe occurs from 10:30 p.m. to around 12:30 a.m., depending on the programme which precedes it.

Overnight occurs anywhere from midnight to 5:00 a.m., and features mostly reruns, home shopping advertorials and religious programs. From around 4:00 a.m. until local news resumes, the three networks air the three U.S. breakfast shows (&quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;) in a condensed format with continuity meant for American local television stations removed (the U.S. &quot;Today&quot; show is retitled &quot;NBC Today&quot; in Australia, to avoid confusion with the Today, which airs on a different network than the U.S. show).

===Daily variations===
There are some variations to dayparting based on the day. The highest ratings are achieved in primetime on Sunday to Thursday, although the early fringe holds lifestyle shows before the news instead of game shows. Friday and Saturday primetime, much like the U.S., has lower audience numbers due to the fact that younger audiences are not at home watching television, though this varies depending on the country. Friday nights feature live Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL) matches, as well as less popular series or movies, although lifestyle series &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; has pulled in high ratings on Friday nights, airing before live sport events. Saturday nights are dedicated to either family movies or programming for older audiences, such as movies or series such as &quot;Heartbeat&quot; or &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;; AFL also airs on Saturday nights.

Friday and Saturday nights are almost the only times when programming differs between states, due to the differing popularity of sports interstate. AFL is only broadcast live in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, while the NRL is only shown in the other states (Queensland, Northern Territory, New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory) live.

Weekend daytime is also very different; with the exception of sport and weekend breakfast programs, there are no regular programs.

<text>Relativity is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in December 1953. The first version of this work was a woodcut made earlier that same year.

It depicts a world in which the normal laws of gravity do not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining. There are windows and doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings. All of the figures are dressed in identical attire and have featureless bulb-shaped heads. Identical characters such as these can be found in many other Escher works. 

In the world of &quot;Relativity&quot;, there are three sources of gravity, each being orthogonal to the two others. Each inhabitant lives in one of the gravity wells, where normal physical laws apply. There are sixteen characters, spread between each gravity source, six in one and five in each of the other two. The apparent confusion of the lithograph print comes from the fact that the three gravity sources are depicted in the same space.

The structure has seven stairways, and each stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity sources. This creates interesting phenomena, such as in the top stairway, where two inhabitants use the same stairway in the same direction and on the same side, but each using a different face of each step; thus, one descends the stairway as the other climbs it, even while moving in the same direction nearly side by side. In the other stairways, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing normally.

Each of the three parks belongs to one of the gravity wells. All but one of the doors seem to lead to basements below the parks. Though metaphysically possible, such basements are unusual and add to the surreal effect of the picture.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Relativity&quot; is one of Escher&#x27;s most popular works, and has been used in a variety of ways.

<text>Convex and Concave is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in March 1955.

It depicts an ornate architectural structure with many stairs, pillars and other shapes. The relative aspects of the objects in the image are distorted in such a way that many of the structure&#x27;s features can be seen as both convex shapes and concave impressions. This is a very good example of Escher&#x27;s mastery in creating illusions of &quot;impossible architecture.&quot; The windows, roads, stairs and other shapes can be perceived as opening out in seemingly impossible ways and positions. Even the image on the flag is of reversible cubes. One can view these features as concave by viewing the image upside-down.

All additional elements and decoration on the left are consistent with a viewpoint from above, while those on the right with a viewpoint from below: hiding half the image makes it very easy to switch between convex and concave.

<text>Brad Andrew Williams (born 20 November 1974) is an Australian former cricketer, who played Tests and ODIs.

==Domestic career==
He is a right arm fast bowler who made his first-class debut for Victoria in the 1994–95 season as a nineteen-year-old.

Williams moved to Western Australia for the 1999–2000 season after struggling to hold down a regular spot in the Victorian team. On the bouncy WACA pitch in Perth he went on to his most successful domestic season, capturing 50 first-class wickets, leading to his national debut the following year.

After taking five first class wickets for the Warriors at a bowling average of 57 in the first three matches of the 2005–06 season, he was dropped for the fourth game of the season against the Tasmanian Tigers, and he reacted by storming out of the training session and withdrawing himself for the team to play the Tigers in an ING Cup one-day match. That was viewed by the Western Australian Cricket Association as a breach of his playing contract, and Williams was suspended for the remainder of the season. When Western Australia announced their squad for the 2006/07 season he was the notable omission, ostensibly ending his cricket career.

==International career==
At the time he had raw speed and was widely tipped as a future star for the national team, although his debut for Australia didn&#x27;t come until a One Day International match against New Zealand in January 2001.

Williams had to wait until October 2003 for his Test debut but he struggled to hold down a regular spot in the national team, due in part to limited opportunity.

== Career highlights ==
* Williams&#x27; best Test batting score of 10 not out was made against India, Melbourne, 2003–2004
* His best Test bowling figures of 4 for 53 came against India, Melbourne, 2003–2004
* Williams&#x27; best ODI batting score of 13 not out was made against New Zealand, Melbourne, 2001–2002
* His best ODI bowling figures of 5 for 22 came against Zimbabwe, Sydney, 2003–2004

<doc id="977933" wikidata="Q2732224" url="?curid=977933" title="Shane Watson">
<text>Shane Robert Watson (born 17 June 1981) is an Australian cricket coach, commentator and former cricketer who played for and occasionally captained the Australian national cricket team between 2002 and 2016. He was an all-rounder who played as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He was ranked as the world&#x27;s No. 1 all-rounder in Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) for 150 weeks, including an all-time record of 120 consecutive weeks from 13 October 2011 to 30 January 2014. He began playing during the Australian team&#x27;s golden era in the early 2000s, and was the last player from this era to retire. In his time playing for Australia, Watson was part of their winning squad in the Cricket World Cup two times in 2007, and 2015 along with the ICC Champions Trophy twice in 2006 and 2009, with Watson named as the player of the match in the final on both occasions, as he scored the winning run in the 2006 tournament, with the winning six in the 2009 tournament.

Watson also played Twenty20 cricket for a number of leagues around the world, including the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was named the player of the tournament in the IPL twice (in 2008 and 2013) and won the tournament twice (in 2008 and 2018). He continued to play in Twenty20 leagues after his retirement from international cricket in 2016, and retired from all forms of cricket in 2020.

==Early life and career==
Watson was raised in Ipswich, Queensland. For his education he attended St Marys Primary School and Ipswich Grammar School. He began playing cricket at an early age and represented Queensland Primary Schools in an interstate championship in Darwin in 1993. He began playing club cricket in Ipswich for the local Brothers club, then played Brisbane Grade Cricket for Eastern Suburbs. He represented the state at both under-17s level (in 1996/97) and under-19s level (in 1997/98, 1998/99, and 1999/00), and ultimately represented Australia in the 2000 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

Watson was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 2000. Before 2000, players who were part of the academy were required to play cricket in their home states in the following year, but a rule change that year made Watson a free agent, and he chose to move to Hobart, Tasmania where he was guaranteed an immediate place in the Tasmanian state team. He played for Tasmania in the second half of the 2000–01 Sheffield Shield season, making his way up the order from batting at number 7 on debut to batting at number 4 at season&#x27;s end. In half a season he scored 309 runs at an average of 51.50, including his maiden first-class century in his fifth match, and took 11 wickets at an average of 26.27. At the end of the season he signed a three-year contract with Tasmania.

==International career==
===2002–2009===
Watson was first selected for the Australian team in early 2002, being selected to tour South Africa with the Test team. He had topped the Pura Cup wicket-taking charts for Tasmania, as well as had steady middle-order batting performances. On the tour, he played a tour match against the South Africa A side, where he scored a quickfire century off of 96 deliveries and took three wickets. Watson also made his ODI debut on tour, replacing Steve Waugh, who was sacked after the team failed to make the finals of the 2001–02 VB Series.

Watson continued as a regular member of the ODI team in place of Waugh despite public support for Waugh to return to the ODI team. He stayed in the team until the start of 2003, when he suffered three stress fractures in his back, meaning he missed the 2003 Cricket World Cup. When he returned to cricket from his injury, he was only able to bat, not bowl, while his recovery finished.

Watson was contracted with Hampshire to play county cricket in 2004. He signed as a replacement player, as Hampshire knew that their two international players (Shane Warne and Michael Clarke) would be unavailable for part of the season while they played for Australia. In April 2004, Watson also switched teams in domestic cricket, moving back to his home state to play for Queensland.

In January 2005, Watson made his test debut in the third Test of Australia&#x27;s home series against Pakistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Watson was played as Australia&#x27;s fifth bowler, giving them the ability to play three fast bowlers (including Watson) and two spin bowlers (instead of the usual one) on a dry pitch that was expected to be conducive to spin bowling.

Watson was part of Australia&#x27;s ODI squad in their 2005 tour of England. While on the tour, the Australian team spent a night in Lumley Castle in County Durham. The castle is believed to be haunted, and Watson was &quot;spooked out&quot; by his room so fled and spent the night sleeping on the floor in teammate Brett Lee&#x27;s room instead. Australian selectors included Watson as the fifth bowler and all rounder in all Test matches following the 2005 Ashes series. Watson played against the ICC World XI in the role, but he dislocated his shoulder in just his second Test in that designated role against the West Indies, after diving to field a ball. Watson was again replaced by Symonds and was unable to represent Australia for the remainder of the summer.
This changed when Watson opened the batting for Australia at the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, alongside wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, instead of Simon Katich. After failing in the first two matches against the West Indies and England, Watson made a 50 in Australia&#x27;s victory over India, which sealed their place in the semi-finals, he then took 2 wickets and scored 57 not out in the finals to seal the win. In the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy held in South Africa, Watson again played a prominent role, making two consecutive 100s against England and New Zealand in semi-final and final, helping Australia to defend their title.

Watson was named in the squad for the 2006–07 Ashes series against England. However, he came off the ground in a one-day domestic game the week before the first Test with a suspected hamstring tear, which ruled him out for the first three Tests.

Watson had expected to be fit for the Boxing Day Test, however, another injury setback in a match for Queensland ruled Watson out for the rest of the Ashes series. Watson eventually returned in February to the ODI side, replacing Cameron White in the all rounder position, However he again broke down with injury during the 29th match of 2007 Cricket World Cup and missed two matches of the Super 8&#x27;s before returning in fine style scoring an unbeaten 65 off 32 balls against New Zealand. Injury again struck Watson in the early stages of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 as he missed most of the tournament due to hamstring strain. He was then out of action for the 2007–08 Australian season.

After Symonds was omitted from the Australian team for disciplinary reasons, Watson took the all rounder&#x27;s position for the tour of India in late 2008, batting at No. 6. During the Third Test in Delhi, he was involved in a series of confrontations with Indian opener Gautam Gambhir, who scored a double century and reached his century by lofting Watson over wide long-on for six.

After returning to Australia, Symonds was recalled to the Test team and both all rounders played in the First Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. As the pitch was a green, rain-affected moist surface expected to favour seamers, spinner Jason Krejza was dropped to accommodate two seam bowling all rounders. After the match, which Australia won, Watson was dropped as spinner Nathan Hauritz was included and Symonds retained. At the end of the year, Watson suffered a stress fracture of the back. Watson returned to international duty in the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, scoring a century.
He returned to the Australian Test side for the 3rd Ashes Test match at Edgbaston on 30 July 2009 as an opener. In a rain interrupted match he made 62 and 53 batting alongside Simon Katich. He scored his second highest Test score of 96 against the West Indies in the Second Test in Adelaide in December 2009. He and Katich put on a century stand and he had reached 96 at stumps, only to inside edge his first ball of the next morning onto his stumps while attempting to hit a boundary to reach his century. In the Third Test, he made 89 in another century stand with Katich. In the second innings, he removed opposition captain Chris Gayle and then charged towards him, screaming in celebration directly in front of him. This earned him a fine from the match referee.

In the First Test against Pakistan, he made 93 runs on Boxing Day and featured in his third century stand in as many matches with Katich, but was run out after a mix-up with Katich in which both players ended up running towards the same end, again falling short of his debut Test hundred. On Day four, Watson finally made his first Test hundred, which came in interesting style, by hitting the ball hard to the fielder at point who put the catch down. When Ponting declared, he remained not out on 120. Watson was awarded man of the match on 30 December for his role in Australia&#x27;s Test victory.

In the second innings of the Second Test at the SCG, Watson fell short of another century, dismissed for 97. During this Test, the Australian Cricket Media Association presented Watson with Australian Cricketer of the Year Award.

===2010–2014===
In the first test of Australia&#x27;s 2010 tour of India, Watson opened his account with his second test century – an attritional 126 runs off 338 balls on a slow, low Mohali pitch. The innings capped an excellent start to the tour, as he also scored a century in each innings of the warm-up match, albeit at a much brisker pace. He topscored again in the second innings with a run-a-ball 56, which proved vital in setting a competitive target as Australia&#x27;s middle order again collapsed in spectacular fashion following his dismissal.

During this period as an opener, he had the highest Australian Test batting average (50.40) for 2 calendar years (2009–2010).

On 30 March 2011, Watson was named test and ODI vice-captain. On 11 April 2011 he made 185 not out off 96 balls against Bangladesh. Watson made several records in this match, which include most sixes, highest score by an Australian batsman, fastest 150, most runs from boundaries, highest individual score while chasing in an ODI and highest score in the second innings of an ODI match, dethroning MS Dhoni&#x27;s 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 (he held this record until it was broken by Fakhar Zaman in April 2021).

During 2010–2013, he won a series of Australian &quot;Player of the Year&quot; awards, including the Allan Border Medal in 2010 and 2011.

Before the start of 2012 ICC World Twenty20, there were no expectations on Australia as it was ranked only 10th in the world. After two stages of the tournament, Australia were placed at sixth, moving up four places and became one of the favourites to win the tournament. This is the only time a team&#x27;s place in the rankings has changed so drastically in a short time, due to four straight wins against top-ranked teams. Much of this success was due to an in-form Shane Watson.

In the first match against Ireland at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Watson opened the bowling and took 3–26 (the wickets of opener-captain William Porterfield, keeper-batsman Niall O&#x27;Brien and all-rounder Kevin O&#x27;Brien); he then scored 51 from 30 balls to help his side win the match in 15.1 overs. He was subsequently named as Man of the Match. In the next match against the West Indies he again opened the bowling and batting, taking 2–29 from 4 overs (the wickets of Chris Gayle &amp; Kieron Pollard). He then scored 41 not out from 24 balls to win the Man of the Match award as his side won by 17 runs (by the Duckworth-Lewis method). Against India, he was used as second change bowler and took 3–34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of Yuvraj Singh and opener Irfan Pathan in the 11th over. He also dismissed Suresh Raina in the last over. He followed it up with 72 from 42 balls (7 sixes and 2 fours) making a mockery of the target 141. Against South Africa he took 2–29 (the wickets of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers), following it up with 70 from 47 balls to win his fourth consecutive Man of the Match award. At the completion of the group stages and Super Eight stages, Watson had the most runs, wickets and sixes. His dominance with both bat and ball made him the unanimous choice of the experts to be named Player of the Tournament.

Watson was part of Australia&#x27;s team in their 2013 Test series in India. Australia suffered heavy defeats in the first two Test matches. After the second match, coach Mickey Arthur requested that the players each give an individual presentation on the team&#x27;s failures and where they could improve. Watson and three other players (Mitchell Johnson, James Pattinson, and Usman Khawaja) failed to do so. As a result, the team management (including Arthur and captain Michael Clarke, who was a team selector at the time) decided not to consider the four players for selection in the third Test match. Watson and his then-pregnant wife left India and returned home to Australia for the birth of their child, a contingency that had been in place before he was dropped. Watson returned to India for the final match of the series, and stood in as the team&#x27;s captain because Clarke had a back injury. Australia lost the match and ultimately lost the series 4–0, with Watson&#x27;s poor batting in particular letting the team down.

Following the series in India, Australia played back-to-back Ashes series in the 2013 English summer and the 2013–14 Australian summer. Watson played in both series, batting at number 3.

===2015–2016===

Shane Watson was named as one of the members of Australia&#x27;s 15-man World Cup squad on 11 January 2015. He played in all but one of Australia&#x27;s World Cup matches, as Australia went on to win the tournament. Watson had a disappointing start to his World Cup campaign, dismissed for a first ball duck in Australia&#x27;s first match of the tournament against England, and dismissed for 23 against New Zealand in a losing effort. As a result of his poor form, Watson was dropped for Australia&#x27;s match against Afghanistan, and was replaced by James Faulkner. However, he was reinstated for Australia&#x27;s next match against Sri Lanka, scoring 67 off 41 balls, and taking 1/71 off 7 overs as Australia prevailed by 64 runs. In Australia&#x27;s final group stage match, against Scotland, Watson scored 24 runs from 23 balls and took 1/18 off three overs as Australia defeated Scotland by 7 wickets and qualified for the knockout stage. In Australia&#x27;s quarter final match against Pakistan, Watson was on the receiving end of a bowling spell from Wahab Riaz which received praise from numerous cricketers. After being dropped by Rahat Ali at square leg at 4 runs, Watson went on to score 64 not out from 66 balls as Australia recorded a 6 wicket victory with 97 balls to spare. Watson played in Australia&#x27;s 95 run semi-final victory over India, scoring 28 runs from 30 balls. Watson played in the 2015 Cricket World Cup Final, scoring 2 not out as Australia prevailed over New Zealand by 7 wickets, winning their fifth Cricket World Cup as a result.

Watson was part of Australia&#x27;s squad for their 2015 tour of England, which included the 2015 Ashes series. He played in the first Test match of the Ashes in Cardiff, but he failed to take any wickets with the ball or score many runs with the bat. He was dropped from the team for the rest of the series. In the following ODI series against England, Watson suffered a calf injury which ruled him out of the rest of the tour. After this injury, Watson decided to retire from Test cricket with the hope of continuing to play in the two shorter formats.

On 31 January 2016, Watson was named T20I captain and became one of the few Australians to captain in all formats, he opened the innings after a long gap and scored 124*, which made several records, including becoming the first Australian batsman to score a century in all three formats of the game.

Watson played for Australia in the 2016 World Twenty20 in March 2016 in India. Partway through the tournament, on 24 March, 14 years to the day since his international debut for Australia, Watson announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the tournament. Watson was the last remaining Australian player from Australia&#x27;s dominant era in the early 2000s (having made his debut before Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath retired in 2007, usually seen as the end of Australia&#x27;s dominant era). He played his final match in Australia&#x27;s loss to India in their final group match, which knocked them out of the tournament.

==T20 franchise cricket==
===Indian Premier League===
Watson played for Rajasthan Royals in seven of the first eight seasons of the Indian Premier League, signing for the side for the inaugural IPL season in 2008. He was the Player of the Tournament during the season, but missed the second season whilst on international duty. In 2013 he scored his first Twenty20 century playing against Chennai Super Kings, scoring 101 runs from 61 balls, hitting six fours and six sixes. He again won the Player of the Tournament in 2013. He captained the side in 2014 and was the highest-paid overseas player.

In 2016, Rajasthan were suspended from the competition for two years. Watson was forced to enter the IPL auction for the first time since 2008, and was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for AU$1.96 million, the most of any Australian player. He captained the side for some matches during the 2017 season but was signed by Chennai Super Kings for the following season. He scored his third and fourth IPL centuries during the 2018 season, and remained with the side in 2019.

Watson was Chennai&#x27;s leading run-scorer in 2019 with 398 runs across 17 matches. Chennai reached the 2019 IPL final. After the Mumbai Indians batted first and scored 149, Watson top-scored for Chennai with 80 runs off 59 balls. His innings took the match into the final over, but he was run out and Chennai finished their innings on 148 runs, losing the final by a single run. Following the match, Watson&#x27;s teammate Harbhajan Singh posted a photograph taken during the match on Instagram. The photograph showed Watson&#x27;s pant leg soaked with blood, and Singh wrote in the image&#x27;s caption that &quot;[Watson] got 6 stitches after the game ... got injured while diving but continue [sic] to bat without telling anyone&quot;.

Watson played his final IPL season in 2020 for Chennai. On 2 November 2020, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Ahead of IPL 2022, Watson joined Delhi Capitals as assistant coach of the franchise.

===Other leagues===
Watson signed with Australian Big Bash League franchise Sydney Thunder in 2015 and was a member of the team that won the BBL that season. He was the captain of the team. He played for the side until the end of the 2018/19 season. In the 2018–19 BBL season, Watson scored his maiden BBL century against the Brisbane Heat. In doing so, he became the first Australian player to score a century in the BBL, the IPL, and in T20I cricket.

In 2016 Watson was announced as one of the icon players for the first season of the Pakistan Super League. He played for Islamabad United initially, moving to Quetta Gladiators in subsequent seasons. Quetta Gladiators appointed Shane Watson as the Head Coach for the PSL 9 Season. The same year he was a marquee player in the Caribbean Premier League, playing in the league for two seasons.

==Statistics and achievements==
Watson was one of the most successful all-rounders in the history of international cricket, particularly in limited overs matches. At the end of his international career in 2016, he was one of only seven cricketers to have scored 10,000 runs and taken 250 wickets in international cricket.

In ODI cricket, Watson was ranked as the No. 1 all-rounder in the world in 2011, and reached a career-high as the No. 3 batter in the world. As part of the Australian team, he won the Cricket World Cup twice (in 2007 and 2015) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (in 2006 and 2009), winning the player-of-the-match award in the tournament final both times.

In T20I cricket he was ranked as the No. 1 all-rounder in the world for two years, and also peaked as the No. 1 batter in the world. He never won the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup with Australia, but he was named the player of the tournament in the 2012 tournament, when he had the most runs and second-most wickets of all players at the tournament.

===International centuries===
Watson scored 14 centuries in international cricket: four in Test matches, nine in ODIs and one in a Twenty20 International. When he scored his maiden Twenty20 International century in 2016, he became the 10th player in history to score a century in all three formats, and the first Australian to achieve the feat.



===Awards===
Across all three formats of international cricket (Test, ODI, and T20I), Watson has been named the Player of the Match on 29 occasions and the Player of the Series on 7 occasions. The majority of these awards came in One Day International cricket, where he won 17 Player of the Match awards and 4 Player of the Series awards.

Cricket Australia holds an annual awards ceremony called the Australian Cricket Awards, where they honour the best cricketers in the country over the previous year. The most prestigious of these awards is the Allan Border Medal, which is awarded to &quot;the most outstanding Australian male cricketer of the season&quot;. Watson has won the Allan Border Medal twice, and has won several other awards at the Australian Cricket Awards:

*Allan Border Medal: 2010, 2011
*Test Player of the Year: 2011
*Men&#x27;s ODI Player of the Year: 2010, 2011, 2012
*Men&#x27;s T20I Player of the Year: 2012, 2013, 2017
*Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year: 2002
*ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team of the Year: 2010, 2011, 2012

===Records===
During his international career, Watson set several records with his performances as both a batsman and a bowler.

* In an ODI against Bangladesh in April 2011, Watson scored 185 runs off of 96 deliveries. In this innings, Watson hit 15 sixes (at the time the most of any ODI innings, and as of January 2023 still the 6th-most of any ODI innings) and scored 150 runs from boundaries alone (at the time the most of any ODI innings, and as of January 2023 still the 4th-most of any ODI innings).
* In a Test match against South Africa in November 2011, Watson took bowling figures of 5/17 from 5 overs. Taking a wicket every 6 balls, as of January 2023 this is the 8th-best bowling strike rate of any Test innings with 4 or more wickets taken.
* In a Twenty20 International against India in January 2016, Watson scored 124 runs from 71 deliveries. At the time, this was the second-highest score in any Twenty20 International (it remains the 10th-highest as of January 2023) and the highest score by a captain (it remains the 3rd-highest as of January 2023). Australia ultimately lost this match by 7 wickets, and as of January 2023 this remains the highest score by a player in a losing side. At the time this was also the longest innings in a Twenty20 International by number of balls faced (as of January 2023 it is the 4th-longest).

==Personal life==

<doc id="977934" wikidata="Q3107510" url="?curid=977934" title="Shaun Tait">
<text>Shaun Tait (born 22 February 1983) is a former Australian professional cricketer who was appointed as the bowling coach of the Pakistan national cricket team in February 2022. He played as a right arm fast bowler and represented Australia in all three forms of cricket, but had most success in One Day Internationals, in which he was a member of Australia&#x27;s undefeated team at the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and Twenty20 cricket. Tait won four different awards throughout his career including the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year in 2004. He is considered one of the fastest bowlers of all time. 

Tait retired from Test cricket in 2009, and later from One Day Internationals in March 2011, to concentrate on playing T20 cricket. In March 2017, Tait announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.

==Bowling style==
Tait&#x27;s delivery action was a sling style reminiscent of former Australian fast bowler Jeff Thomson&#x27;s action. Dubbed &quot;The Wild Thing&quot;, during his career Tait was considered one of the fastest bowlers in the world, regularly bowling at speeds up to 155 km/h. During a Twenty20 international match in February 2010 Tait bowled a ball measured at 160.7 km/h, the fastest ball ever recorded in Australia. Tait has often been described as &quot;erratic&quot; and is capable of bowling many extras, although his unpredictability can be a positive factor in dismissing batsmen. Tait has also been criticised as being &quot;expensive.&quot;

After a Twenty20 match against New Zealand on 11 December 2007, in which Tait troubled the batsmen and took 2/22, New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and coach John Bracewell publicly raised doubts over the legality of Tait&#x27;s bowling action. Tait labelled the comments as a &quot;disgrace&quot; and added that he would be willing to undergo tests to prove his action was legal.

==Early career==
Tait played for South Australia throughout his first-class career, also playing for Australia A and, in 2004, for Durham County Cricket Club in England. He took almost 200 first-class wickets after making his first-class debut at the age of 19 against Western Australia in December 2002 at Adelaide Oval. He only bowled in one innings on debut, taking three wickets for the cost of 77 runs (3/77) from 22.2 overs. Tait played five matches during his first season, taking 20 wickets at a bowling average of 22.55 runs per wicket. He made his List A debut in February 2003 and as a result of his strong first season, was awarded a place at the Australian Cricket Academy alongside players such as Ben Hilfenhaus and Luke Ronchi.

Tait was South Australia&#x27;s leading wicket taker, and the second leading wicket taker overall in the 2003–04 ING Cup with 18 wickets at an average of 19.61. The highlight of his season was his record-breaking haul of 8/43 against Tasmania on 9 January 2004. These were the best figures by an Australian in List A cricket, and the eighth-best List A figures of all time. He was selected in the Australia A team to take on the touring India side. He took 3/85 in the Indians&#x27; first innings. He once again had a strong Sheffield Shield season, taking 30 wickets at an average of 28.33
 and he was awarded the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year award.

In July 2004, Tait was signed by Durham County Cricket Club for the second half of the English County Championship season. His first match was against a Somerset side captained by fellow Australian Ricky Ponting, although he did not take a wicket and bowled 21 no balls in his 12 overs. Tait only played one more first-class match for Durham before returning to Australia.

Tait was awarded his first Cricket Australia central-contract for the 2004–05 season, being included ahead of Queensland fast bowler Andy Bichel. Tait repaid the selectors&#x27; faith in him by having his best season to date; he took 65 first-class wickets at an average of 20.16, surpassing Clarrie Grimmett&#x27;s record for most wickets in a season for a South Australian bowler.

After missing the opening half of the 2005–06 domestic season with an injury to his right shoulder, sustained on the Ashes tour, Tait struggled on his return, taking only 14 wickets at 38.35 in the four matches in which he was able to play. Despite this, he was still named as part of the Australia A squad to play in the 2006 Top End Series. A strong season in 2006–07, taking 29 wickets at 27.10, saw him win the Lord Hampden Trophy for South Australia&#x27;s player of the season.

An elbow injury kept Tait out for the opening parts of the 2007–08 Sheffield Shield season, however, upon recovery, a match against Queensland at the Brisbane Cricket Ground saw him take his first 10-wicket haul. He took 3/69 in the first innings and 7/29 in the second, his best first-class figures.

==International debut==
Tait was named in Australia&#x27;s Test squad to tour Sri Lanka in 2004 as a replacement for the injured Brett Lee, although he did not play in a Test on the tour. After an impressive domestic summer, in April 2005 he was named in Australia&#x27;s squad to tour England for the 2005 Ashes series and made his Test match debut against England on 25 August 2005 at Trent Bridge in the fourth match of the series. Some suggested that Tait should have played in the first Test of the series, but an injury to Glenn McGrath and the poor form of Jason Gillespie gave Tait his chance later in the series. Tait bowled 24 overs and took 3/97 in his first innings, the best figures of any Australian fast bowler in the match. While he went wicketless in the second innings, he held his spot to play in the final Test of the Ashes series at The Oval, taking 1/61 in the first innings and 1/28 in the second.

A shoulder injury ahead of the Super Series against the ICC World XI, saw Tait ruled out of playing and despite calls from Jason Gillespie and Ian Chappell for his inclusion in the side for the 2006–07 Ashes series in Australia, he did not get a place in the team with the selectors opting for Stuart Clark.

Tait made his One Day International debut in February 2007 against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series. Later that month, he was selected as a part of Australia&#x27;s squad to take on New Zealand for the 2006–07 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in New Zealand. Tait was selected for the final two games of the series, taking two wickets as New Zealand chased down scores of over 300 twice and whitewashed a strong Australian team.

Tait was selected in Australia&#x27;s 15-man squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies. Although he was not expected to play a major role in the Australian side, an injury to Brett Lee meant that a relatively inexperienced Tait assumed Lee&#x27;s mantle as the spearhead of the bowling attack. Despite the added pressure, Tait performed to much acclaim in the World Cup, finishing the tournament as the equal second leading wicket-taker with 23 wickets at an average of 20.30. This included a Player of the Match performance against England in which he claimed 3/41, and taking 4/39 against a strong South African team in the semi-final. He went wicketless in a rain affected final against Sri Lanka, but Australia won the tournament in what was described as the &quot;most dominant campaign&quot; by a team in World Cup history.
Tait was selected in the 13-man squad for Sri Lanka&#x27;s tour of Australia in November 2007, however his ongoing elbow injury forced him out, being replaced by Ben Hilfenhaus. Having returned to fitness in December, he once again earned a spot in the Australian squad, this time for the series against India. While there was some suggestion that Australia might use Tait in a four pronged pace-attack as early as the first Test, spinner Brad Hogg was selected over Tait for the first two Tests. Tait was eventually chosen in place of Hogg for the third Test, with the WACA wicket expected to suit his fast bowling. He went wicketless; his claims to &quot;bowl over&quot; the Indian team had backfired and he announced that he would take an indefinite break from cricket after the match.

==Sabbatical==
In January 2008, Tait announced that he would take an indefinite break from cricket, citing being physically and emotionally exhausted. He stated, &quot;A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear mind and a chance for my body to rest and recover.&quot; In March he said he was &quot;feeling normal again&quot; and was aiming for a comeback at the start of the 2008–09 season. He was awarded a central-contract for the season.

In February 2009, the Rajasthan Royals of the Indian Premier League bought Tait, although he later withdrew from the tournament following an injury. In May 2009 Cricket Australia announced that Tait would not have his contract renewed for the 2009–10 season. Tait described this as &quot;a kick in the teeth&quot;. Following the withdrawal of Andrew Symonds&#x27; contract after he was sent back from Britain before the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Tait was given a replacement contract.

==2010 to retirement==
In 2009, Tait gave up first-class cricket indefinitely to focus on the shorter forms of the game. He played in Australia&#x27;s one-day squad in 2010 and rejoined the Australian one-day squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, playing in seven games and taking 11 wickets before the side lost to India in the quarter-finals. Following Australia&#x27;s exit from the tournament, Tait announced his retirement from 50-over cricket, stating that he intended to focus on playing Twenty20 cricket.

He played in the Indian Premier League for Rajasthan between 2010 and 2013, in the Australian Big Bash League for Melbourne Renegades, Adelaide Strikers and Hobart Hurricanes, in the United Kingdom for Glamorgan and Essex County Cricket Clubs and for sides in a number of other leagues around the world until his retirement from cricket in 2017. During the 2015–16 Big Bash season, he bowled an economical spell of 3/16 for Hobart and was recalled to the national team for the T20 International series against India, but missed selection for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after failing to take a wicket in the two matches he played. Tait announced his retirement from playing in March 2017 due to a chronic elbow injury.

== Coaching ==

In August 2021 Tait was appointed as a bowling consultant to the Afghanistan national cricket team. At the end of the same year he resigned from the post and in February 2022 was appointed as the bowling coach of the Pakistan national cricket team for 12 months.

==Career best performances==
==Personal life==
In August 2013, Tait became engaged to Indian model and entrepreneur Mashoom Singha. They were married in June 2014 in Mumbai. In March 2017, Tait announced that he had become an overseas citizen of India.

<text>Nathan Wade Bracken (born 12 September 1977) is a former Australian cricketer. A tall left-arm fast-medium bowler, Bracken is capable of swinging the ball both ways. He has represented Australia in all forms of the game. Bracken represented New South Wales in Australian domestic cricket, Eastern Suburbs in Sydney Grade Cricket and also appeared for English County team Gloucestershire in 2004. On 28 January 2011 he announced his retirement from the game due to a chronic knee injury. On 9 February 2012 it was reported that he sued Cricket Australia over the latter&#x27;s alleged incompetency in managing his knee injury. With his time representing Australia, Bracken won multiple ICC titles with the team: the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy.

==Early and personal life==

Nathan Bracken was born in Penrith, New South Wales to parents Gordon and Robin. He spent his childhood living in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales, attending Faulconbridge Primary and Springwood High School. He currently resides on the Central Coast of New South Wales and is married to Haley Bracken with whom he has 2 children. He is also studying for an undergraduate degree in communications. Bracken contested the Australian House of Representatives seat of Dobell as an independent against sitting member Craig Thomson at the 2013 federal election and received an 8.2 percent primary vote.

==Domestic career==

===First-class cricket===

After a stint at the Australian Cricket Academy in 1997, Bracken made his first-class debut for New South Wales against Queensland on 27 October 1998 at Manuka Oval, Canberra. New South Wales were beaten by an innings and Bracken finished with figures of 0/86 off 41 overs. He played 5 more first-class matches in the 1998–99 season and finished with 11 wickets at a respectable average of 30.36. The 1999–00 season saw Bracken only play one match, however the 2000–01 season was one of great success for Bracken. He finished the season as New South Wales second leading wicket-taker behind Stuart MacGill with 29 wickets at 23.72. As a result of his outstanding season he was rewarded with a place in the Australian squad for the 2001 Ashes tour, a Cricket Australia contract and won the 2001 Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year award.

After recovering from a shoulder injury he sustained on the 2001 Ashes tour, Bracken played 8 matches for New South Wales in the 2001–02 season. He had a successful season once again, claiming 24 wickets at 31.79 and finishing behind Stuart Clark as the second leading wicket taker for New South Wales. 2002–03 was a season that saw Bracken struggle as he only took 16 wickets in 6 matches at a rather expensive 36.62. 2003–04 saw Bracken make his Test debut and as a result, he appeared less frequently for New South Wales. Despite this, he still performed well in the 4 matches he participated in, taking 16 wickets at 24.75. Following this season, Bracken was signed by Gloucestershire to play in the English first-class competition as a replacement for Mike Smith. Bracken only played 2 matches for the club, however he was quite successful and took 5 wickets at 21.20 with best figures of 2/12 coming against Lancashire.

2004–05 was Bracken&#x27;s best season for New South Wales to date. He played in all 11 matches and took 43 wickets at an average of 18.79. The season contained a number of memorable performances by Bracken including a phenomenal spell of 7/4 off 7 overs to help dismiss South Australia for a mere 29 runs at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 2004. The figures were Bracken&#x27;s best ever at the time, and are amongst the most impressive figures seen in Australian domestic cricket history. He also played an enormous part in New South Wales&#x27; thrilling 1 wicket win in the final against Queensland, winning Man of the Match. Bracken claimed 6/27 in 13.2 overs to help bowl out Queensland for 102 in their first innings and took an important 2/54 in their second innings. To add to this, Bracken scored an invaluable 11* to guide his team home to their target of 183 after New South Wales were 9/161, still needing 22 for victory. 2005–06 saw a return to the Test team for Bracken and as a result, fewer matches for New South Wales. Bracken still performed strongly in his few games, taking 13 wickets at 17.53. After only playing 2 matches in the 2006–07 season, the Blues enjoyed Bracken&#x27;s services in their Pura Cup winning 2007–08 season as he appeared in the final and took 22 wickets at 21.22 during the season.

===List A cricket===
Bracken made his List A debut for New South Wales against the now defunct Canberra Comets on 31 October 1998 at Manuka Oval, Canberra. New South Wales won the match and Bracken was rather economical taking 0/19 off his 5 overs. After a Man of the Match performance against Queensland in the semi-final of the Mercantile Mutual Cup, Bracken was selected in the New South Wales team to meet Victoria in the final in only his 5th List A game. Bracken was economical, taking 0/28 off his 10 overs however New South Wales still lost the final by 39 runs.

After only playing one match in the 1999–00 season, the 2000–01 season proved to be a successful one for Bracken as he made his One Day International debut and helped New South Wales to win the Mercantile Mutual Cup. Bracken took 11 wickets at an average of 25.00, including figures of 2/43 in the final against Western Australia. He continued his good form into the 2001–02 season, helping New South Wales claim their second consecutive One Day title, this time over Queensland. Bracken took 18 wickets at 21.88 during the season, which included his best List A performance to date, as he took 5/38 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 2002–03 was another successful season for both Bracken and New South Wales, as the Blues recorded their third consecutive domestic One Day title and Bracken claimed 15 scalps at 23.66. Bracken was once again a leading performer in the final, taking 2/35 off his 10 overs as New South Wales cruised to a 7 wicket win.

After three seasons of success, Bracken struggled for New South Wales in both the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons taking 3 wickets at 76.33 and 7 wickets at 44.71 respectively. International commitments left Bracken out of the side for a large majority of the 2005–06 One Day season, however he performed well in his limited appearances, claiming 5 wickets at 21.60. Once again, Bracken&#x27;s international duties kept him out of a large majority of the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons and he took 3 wickets at 54.33 and 5 wickets at 37.80 respectively.

==International career==

===Test cricket===

Bracken made his Test debut for Australia on 4 December 2003 against India in the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as a replacement for the injured Glenn McGrath. In a drawn Test, Bracken had a respectable debut Test claiming 1/90 off 26 overs in the first innings and 2/12 off 4 overs in the second. Despite this, Bracken was dropped for Western Australian paceman Brad Williams for the Second Test at Adelaide. The selectors chose Bracken ahead of Andrew Bichel for the final two Tests and in a drawn series that saw most bowlers struggle, he finished with 6 wickets at 58.50.

Due to the strength of fast bowling in Australia, Bracken was kept out of the Test team for nearly 2 years until he was selected in the Australian side for the 1st Test of the 2005–06 Frank Worrell Trophy against the West Indies in Brisbane. It was in this match that Bracken recorded both his best Test batting and bowling performances to date. In Australia&#x27;s first innings he struck 37 off 51 balls and in the West Indians&#x27; second innings, Bracken claimed figures of 4/48 off 16 overs including the wickets of Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Despite this good all-round performance, leg spinner Stuart MacGill was favoured by the selectors for the remaining Tests in the series. In December 2005, Bracken played the 1st Test against South Africa at the WACA Ground before once again being dropped in favour of Stuart MacGill.

Bracken has not played another Test since then due to the rise of Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson however in February 2008 he claimed that he was still eager to claim a spot in the Test team. Bracken is considered unlucky by many for his lack of Test starts given his one-day form – leading to comparisons with Michael Bevan.

=== One Day cricket ===
Bracken made his debut for Australia on 11 January 2001 against the West Indies. Although putting in respectable performances with the ball, he could not manage an assured place in the side due to both injuries and the strength of the Australian team. However, after Jason Gillespie was dropped from the national side, Bracken returned for the 2005 ICC Super Series against the World XI. This began the start of a sustained run in the national team and rise of Bracken as an international cricketer.

In the record-breaking fifth ODI during Australia&#x27;s Tour of South Africa in 2006, Bracken achieved his maiden 5 wicket haul, taking 5–67 off 10 overs. He was the only bowler in the match to concede less than 7 runs an over. From the third ODI of that tour until the 5th match of the Commonwealth Bank series in 2007, Bracken went on a 17 match streak of taking at least a wicket a game. His consistency was rewarded with a place in the 2007 World Cup winning team and took 16 wickets during the campaign.

On 8 February 2008, Bracken achieved his best ever international figures taking 5–47 against Sri Lanka in Sydney. On 8 July Bracken displaced Daniel Vettori as the no. 1 ranked ODI bowler in the world following the series against the West Indies. He was also named in the ICC World ODI team of the year in 2008 and awarded Australia&#x27;s ODI player of the year at the 2009 Allan Border Medal ceremony. Bracken played his last ODI on 17 September 2009 after succumbing to a knee injury and being ruled out of the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. This would be his last appearance in Australian colours as the selectors moved on towards younger players. Bracken later announced he would quit from all forms of international cricket on 29 January 2011.

He finished with 174 ODI wickets at an average of 24.36 and proved to be a vital member of the Australian One Day International side during his career. With a combination of accuracy, swing and cutters, Bracken established himself as one of the most effective limited overs bowlers in the world.

<doc id="977941" wikidata="Q6541009" url="?curid=977941" title="Liberation News Service">
<text>Liberation News Service (LNS) was a New Left, anti-war underground press news agency that distributed news bulletins and photographs to hundreds of subscribing underground, alternative and radical newspapers from 1967 to 1981. Considered the &quot;Associated Press&quot; for the underground press, at its zenith the LNS served more than 500 papers. Founded in Washington, D.C., it operated out of New York City for most of its existence.

== Overview ==
Liberation News Service distributed news to a wide range of audiences, including African Americans, factory workers, women, ethnic minorities, and high school students; and institutions like bookstores, libraries, community centers, and prisons. One of LNS&#x27; mandates was documenting contemporary social movements, including worker strikes in Ohio, miners&#x27; rights movements, and the Attica Prison riot. LNS went beyond domestic news, covering international events in Africa, the Dominican Republic, and Latin America. It offered extensive reporting on the Vietnam War, including the lives of people in both North and South Vietnam. LNS provides scoops on important stories, covering topics like torture in Vietnam and political corruption in San Diego before other major news outlets.

According to former LNS staffers Thorne Dreyer and Victoria Smith, the Liberation News Service &quot;was an attempt at a new kind of journalism — developing a more personalistic style of reporting, questioning bourgeois conceptions of &#x27;objectivity&#x27; and reevaluating established notions about the nature of news...&quot; They pointed out that LNS &quot;provided coverage of events to which most papers would have otherwise had no access, and... put these events into a context, helping new papers in their attempts to develop a political analysis... In many places, where few radicals exist and journalistic experience is lacking, papers have been made possible primarily because LNS copy has been available to supplement scarce local material.&quot; 

The total combined circulation of the LNS-member papers was estimated to be in the millions.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
Liberation News Service was founded in August 1967 by Ray Mungo and Marshall Bloom after they were separated from the United States Student Press Association and its Collegiate Press Service. Operating out of a townhouse at 3 Thomas Circle which they shared with the &quot;Washington Free Press&quot;, the LNS soon released its inaugural mimeographed news packet. 

With support from private donors and assistance from the nearby Institute for Policy Studies, they were soon joined by other young journalists, including Allen Young, Marty Jezer, and photographer David Fenton, sending out packets of articles and photographs on a twice-weekly schedule to underground newspapers across the U.S. and abroad.

=== Expansion ===
During this time the writings of Thorne Webb Dreyer — co-founder of the Austin, Texas, underground paper &quot;The Rag&quot; — were widely distributed, appearing regularly in dozens of periodicals. Dreyer&#x27;s coverage of the October 21, 1967, March on the Pentagon – with its massive acts of civil disobedience – was distributed by LNS and published around the world. The night before the march, Bloom, Mungo, and the other staffers convened a chaotic meeting in a Washington loft with underground press editors from around the country who were in town to cover the event; but they failed to reach an agreement to create a democratic structure in which LNS would be owned and run by its member papers. 

Operating on their own with a volunteer staff of 12, Bloom and Mungo moved forward with ambitious plans for the expansion of LNS. In December 1967 they opened an international Telex line to Oxford, England; and later that winter LNS merged with the Student Communications Network (SCN), based in Berkeley, California, which had its own nationwide Telex network with terminals in Berkeley, Los Angeles, New York, Ann Arbor, Ames, Iowa, Chicago, and Philadelphia, leased from Western Union. The Student Communications Network was a project of the University Christian Movement, a liberal Protestant church organization described as &quot;mostly concerned with political and social issues rather than Christian evangelization.&quot;

=== Opening of the New York office ===
By February 1968, LNS was becoming the hub for alternative journalism in the United States, supplying the growing movement media with interpretive coverage of current events and reports on movement activities and the Sixties counterculture. There were 150 underground papers and 90 college papers subscribing to LNS, with most subscribers paying (or at least being billed) $180 a year. 

LNS took over the former SCN office in New York, which had just been opened by former Columbia University graduate student George Cavalletto and others in a converted Chinese restaurant on Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights. Walking by, Steve Diamond saw a brand new Telex machine sitting in an otherwise empty storefront and a sign seeking volunteers, and attended a meeting shortly afterward at which the New York staff was formed. 

Around this time, &quot;Rag&quot; co-founder Thorne Dreyer left Austin to help build LNS&#x27; editorial collective in New York City. 

Two months after it opened, the New York office became a central focus for LNS activity during the Columbia University student uprising in April 1968, as a continual stream of bulletins going out over the Telex kept underground papers and radio stations across the country up-to-the-minute on the latest developments in the Columbia student strike. To young radicals across the country, it seemed as if the revolution had come.

=== Moving the headquarters to New York ===
Recognizing that New York was where the action was and running short on funds, Bloom and Mungo decided to relocate the national headquarters from the expensive townhouse office in D.C. to the large storefront space in New York, which Cavalletto was renting for only $200 a month. Bringing Allen Young, Harvey Wasserman, Verandah Porche, and some of the other Washington staff with them, along with Sheila Ryan of the &quot;Washington Free Press&quot;, they moved into the New York office. 

A culture clash soon developed, however, between the headquarters staff and the already existing local staff in New York, which had been originally recruited by the Student Communications Network, and who had been running their own affairs up to that point. Over the summer the staff divided into warring cliques polarized between Bloom and Mungo, who controlled the board of directors, and Cavalletto, who held the lease on the office and was paying the rent. The Bloom/Mungo group was repeatedly outvoted in staff votes by the locals, who outnumbered them; only Steve Diamond of the New York group sided with the outsiders.

=== Montague farm fight ===
In August 1968, the fight over control of the organization came to a head. In the wake of a successful fundraising event, Bloom, Mungo, and Diamond surreptitiously took the $6,000 cash that had been raised, and used it to make the down payment on a farm in Montague, Massachusetts which was to be the new headquarters of LNS. 

An angry posse followed them from the New York office to the farm to recover the funds and a tense six-hour standoff ended with Bloom writing a check to Cavalletto, but after the New York group left, Bloom filed kidnapping charges against 13 people, including Cavalletto, Ryan, Dreyer, and Victoria Smith. The charges were later dismissed. 

For the next six months LNS subscribers received rival news packets from LNS-Montague and LNS-New York, but the Montague group was understaffed, underfunded, and isolated on a remote (and cold) country farm. Only the New York headquarters group survived the split, with Young becoming a recognized leader.

Bloom committed suicide the following year. A pro-Montague account of the split appears in Mungo&#x27;s book &quot;Famous Long Ago: My Life and Hard Times with the Liberation News Service&quot;.

=== Reformation as a collective ===
The New York staff continued publication from the Claremont Avenue basement storefront, with the organization run as a collective.

The subscriber base grew to over 500 papers, and a high school underground press service, run by local high school students, was added. Allen Young estimates that something like 200 staffers worked at LNS over the years, &quot;usually with 8-20 full-time participants or staff at any one time.&quot;

In 1969 LNS published a long essay co-authored by Thorne Dreyer and Victoria Smith, titled &quot;The Movement and the New Media,&quot; which was considered to be the first serious journalistic portrait of the increasingly powerful underground press phenomenon. Dreyer also wrote extensively about the growing repression of underground papers throughout the country.

=== Funding crisis ===
Much of LNS&#x27; funding came from liberal Protestant church organizations such as the aforementioned University Christian Movement. In 1970, however, the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security subpoenaed LNS&#x27;s financial records and leaked details about their church funding to a right-wing Midwestern columnist. A conservative newsletter then amplified the story, sparking outrage among some churchgoers in New York, who feared their donations were being used to fund &quot;pro-Mao, pro-Castro pornography.&quot; By 1971, facing this backlash, the churches cut off all funding to LNS. 

As a result of this funding crisis, the well-known journalists and activists I.F. Stone, Jack Newfield, Nat Hentoff, and William M. Kunstler wrote a letter of support for LNS that was published in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. In an appeal for funds, the signers praised the investigative work of LNS, noting that it had &quot;grown from a mimeoed sheet distributed to ten newspapers to a printed 20-page packet of articles and graphics mailed to nearly 800 subscribers twice a week.&quot;

=== Decline and dissolution ===
By the middle of the 1970s, with the end of the Vietnam War and the decline of the New Left, LNS began to dwindle along with the rapidly disappearing underground press. In 1976, operations moved downtown to a loft on West 17th Street. Reduced to serving only 150 newspapers, the LNS collective decided to close operations in August 1981.

== New Liberation News Service ==
In 1990, &quot;LNS was restarted as New Liberation News Service with Ray Mungo&#x27;s blessing by a group of younger radical journalists led by Jason Pramas... They ... publish[ed] NLNS from their offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts,&quot; from 1990 to 1993.

== Archives ==
LNS records are archived variously in the Contemporary Culture Collection of Temple University Libraries, the Archive of Social Change of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Library, Interference Archive, and the Archives &amp; Special Collections at Amherst College; its photographs are archived at New York University&#x27;s Tamiment Library.

<doc id="977958" wikidata="Q7700555" url="?curid=977958" title="Tenonitis">
<text>Tenonitis is a rare eye disease that is represented by inflammation of Tenon&#x27;s capsule. Tenon&#x27;s capsule, also known as the fascial sheath of the eyeball, is a structure surrounding the eyeball, and when it becomes inflamed it may cause issues in regards to vision. Also known as orbital tenonitis, tenonitis is associated with the SLC26A3 gene. The inflammation of the Tenon capsule resulting from heightened blood flow may also affect the lacrimal gland and the extraocular muscles. 
== Signs and Symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms depend on the severity of the case with tenonitis. In mild cases it may just be an uncomfortable sensation in the eye socket. In extreme cases it may cause permanent blindness or eye removal is needed.

* Swelling 
* Intraocular pressure 
* Blindness 

== Causes ==
There are no specific causes of this disease. With this being so rare not enough research has been allocated to pinpoint a specific cause of this disease. The main thing that we know about this disease is that the inflammation of the Tenon capsule may be related to macular retinal edema and intraocular pressure quantitative trait locus.

== Mechanism ==
With the lack of research and understanding about this specific disease it is hard to come up with a mechanism that outlines how this arises in the body. Although we cannot pinpoint specifically how it occurs, there are some findings that may help us get to that point in the future. A gene that is associated with orbital tenonitis is the SLC26A3 gene. This gene mediates chloride and bicarbonate exchange and additionally transports sulfate and other anions at the apical membrane, part of the plasma membrane of enterocytes. It is also known that related phenotypes are &quot;Increased shRNA abundance (Z-score &gt; 2).&quot; 

== Diagnosis ==
Tenonitis can be identified and diagnosed a few different ways. Tenon&#x27;s capsule may have inflammation from a disease called idiopathic orbital inflammation syndrome. There is no history of trauma or adjacent focus of infection with this disease. In order to diagnose tenonitis some type of imaging is needed, such as a CT or MRI. The imaging is used to capture the inflammation and to spot any possible chance of infection. For chronic diseases a biopsy may be needed to determine an underlying condition that may be causing the recurring inflammation.

== Treatment ==
The main course of treatment for this specific disease would be to surgically excise the capsule. There is no info that implies the inflammation of this capsule will go down over time so the known course of action would be to have it surgically removed in order to relieve discomfort and to prevent further irritation to this area.

== Prognosis ==
Although this may not be a lethal disease, it will progressively get worse over time. Depending on the severity of the disease, this may have months of progression. When going past 3 months of having issues, the main course of action would be to surgically relieve the pain or total excision of the affected area.

== Epidemiology ==
This disease has no specific population it targets more. With the information that is provided by previous research, this is a typically universal disease that can affect any population.

== Research Directions ==
Currently there haven&#x27;t been many studies conducted in regards to Tenon&#x27;s capsule. In one study the objective was to see the efficacy of excision of the capsule by way of trabeculectomy alone, and also combined with partial tenonectomy. There is further research needed to be done to determine the cause of this specific disease, what happens during the progression of it, and treatment plans that need to be put in place.

<doc id="977969" wikidata="Q2672046" url="?curid=977969" title="Square Root Day">
<text>Square Root Day is an unofficial holiday celebrated on days when both the day of the month and the month are the square root of the last two digits of the year. For example, the last Square Root Day was April 4, 2016 (4/4/16), and the next Square Root Day will be May 5, 2025 (5/5/25). The final Square Root Day of the century will occur on September 9, 2081. Square Root Days fall upon the same nine dates each century.

Ron Gordon, a Redwood City, California high school teacher, created the first Square Root Day for September 9, 1981 (9/9/81). Gordon remains the holiday&#x27;s publicist, sending news releases to world media outlets. Gordon&#x27;s daughter set up a Facebook group where people can share how they were celebrating the day.

One suggested way of celebrating the holiday is by eating radishes or other root vegetables cut into shapes with square cross sections (thus creating a &quot;square root&quot;).

== Full list ==
Square Root Day occurs on the following dates each century:

*1/1/01
*2/2/04
*3/3/09
*4/4/16
*5/5/25
*6/6/36
*7/7/49

<text>David Adam Segal (born 1979/1980) is an American politician, activist, and writer who was a Democratic member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, representing District 2 (East Providence and Providence) from 2007 until January 2011. Prior to that, he served as Minority Leader of the Providence City Council from 2003 until 2007, elected at the age of 22 as the first and only member of the Green Party ever elected in Rhode Island. Segal was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in the state&#x27;s 1st congressional district on September 14, 2010. He serves as the executive director of the online organizing group Demand Progress.

==Early life and education==
Segal was born in Washington, D.C. He graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Columbia University in 2001. He has served as a fellow at Yale Law School&#x27;s Information Society Project and at Stanford Law School&#x27;s Center for Internet and Society.

==Political career==
Segal&#x27;s political career began in 2002, following his work as activist in support of a living-wage ordinance and a civilian review board to review accusations of police abuse. Segal ran as a Green for the Providence City Council and was elected to the Providence City Council, representing Ward One, with approximately 38% of the vote in a four-way general election.

Segal was chairman and founder of the federal political action committee Greens for Impact which helped steer the Green Party to endorse David Cobb rather than Ralph Nader, and ran a national media and direct-mail campaign in 2004, encouraging Greens and progressives in swing states to fight the re-election of George W. Bush by voting for John Kerry, and promoting electoral reform.

Following a party switch to the Democratic Party, Segal won the party primary election for state representative in Rhode Island House District 2 with 68.5 percent of the vote on September 12, 2006. Segal faced no partisan opposition on the November 7, 2006, state general election. Segal was re-elected in 2008, again winning 68.4% of the Democratic primary vote.

During his tenure in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, Segal was a member of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee as well as the Judiciary Committee. He previously served on the Corporations Committee. He has sponsored and overseen the passage of legislation promoting renewable energy and public transit, reform of the criminal justice system, progressive taxation, maintenance of social services, equitable school funding, and more. He was secretary of the House of Representatives&#x27; progressive caucus during the 2009-2010 sessions. &quot;The Providence Phoenix&quot; declared him &quot;The Hippest Guy in State Government&quot;.

===Congressional campaigns===
====2010====
Segal ran for Congress in the 2010 elections for Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district, for the seat held by Patrick J. Kennedy, who did not seek re-election. Segal lost in the four-way September 14, 2010, Democratic Party primary to David Cicilline, garnering over 20% of the vote.

====2022====
Segal ran for the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in the 2022 election, for the seat being vacated by James Langevin, coming in second place out of six candidates in the Democratic primary.

==Activism==
As the executive director of the online organizing, policy, and lobbying group Demand Progress, Segal has advocated to defeat SOPA, curtail mass surveillance, protect net neutrality, confront corporate monopoly power, reduce militarism, and promote other progressive causes. Segal is a co-editor of a book about the organizing that led to the defeat of SOPA, published by O/R Books, called &quot;Hacking Politics&quot;.

<doc id="977972" wikidata="Q3500274" url="?curid=977972" title="Street Songs">
<text>Street Songs is the fifth studio album by American musician Rick James, released in April 1981 on Gordy Records. It contained two of James&#x27;s biggest hits: the singles &quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Super Freak&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Give It to Me Baby&quot;, the lead single from the album, became James&#x27;s second number one single on the R&amp;B chart, spending five weeks at the top spot. The next single, &quot;Super Freak&quot;, was an even bigger hit, reaching number 16 on the Billboard Top 100.

A Deluxe Edition was released in 2001 containing an additional 17 mixes and live versions of the album tracks. Although the song &quot;Fire and Desire&quot; (a duet he performed with singer Teena Marie) was not originally released as a single, the song itself received much airplay on R&amp;B radio stations and has since become a classic hit. James and Marie would reunite to perform the song at the 2004 BET Awards 5 weeks before James&#x27; death.

==Reception==
The album became an immediate success upon its release, eventually reaching number three on the US Pop chart—James&#x27;s highest-charting album during his career—and spending twenty weeks at number one on the US R&amp;B chart. The album was certified platinum in the US in July 1981. By 1983, the album had sold nearly 4 million copies worldwide. At the 1982 Grammys, James was nominated for Best Male Rhythm and Blues Vocal Performance for the album while being the first African American male artist to be nominated in the Best Male Rock Vocal Performance category for the song &quot;Super Freak&quot;.

<text>The East Hawaii Cultural Center (EHCC) is an art gallery, community theater, and cultural center in downtown Hilo, Hawaii. EHCC features regular art exhibitions with free or suggested donation entry to the general public. Founded by an umbrella group of local arts organizations, the Center is housed in a historic former police station facing Kalakaua Park.

==Building history==
The building was listed as site 79000752 on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1979.

The two-story structure is built from reinforced concrete with wooden interiors.
It is located at 141 Kalakaua Street, coordinates .
The area had been used for civic buildings since about 1817, with the park across the street created by King David Kalākaua in 1877. In February 1969 the court was moved to a new state office building, and in 1975 the police department moved to a larger building, leaving it vacant.

==Cultural Council==
The East Hawaii Cultural Council was founded in 1967, and leased the building which was planned for demolition.

<doc id="977983" wikidata="Q5074271" url="?curid=977983" title="Charge qubit">
<text>In quantum computing, a charge qubit (also known as Cooper-pair box) is a qubit whose basis states are charge states (i.e. states which represent the presence or absence of excess Cooper pairs in the island). In superconducting quantum computing, a charge qubit is formed by a tiny superconducting island coupled by a Josephson junction (or practically, superconducting tunnel junction) to a superconducting reservoir (see figure). The state of the qubit is determined by the number of Cooper pairs that have tunneled across the junction. In contrast with the charge state of an atomic or molecular ion, the charge states of such an &quot;island&quot; involve a macroscopic number of conduction electrons of the island. The quantum superposition of charge states can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage &quot;U&quot; that controls the chemical potential of the island. The charge qubit is typically read-out by electrostatically coupling the island to an extremely sensitive electrometer such as the radio-frequency single-electron transistor.

Typical &quot;T&quot;2 coherence times for a charge qubit are on the order of 1–2 μs. Recent work has shown &quot;T&quot;2 times approaching 100 μs using a type of charge qubit known as a transmon inside a three-dimensional superconducting cavity. Understanding the limits of &quot;T&quot;2 is an active area of research in the field of superconducting quantum computing.

== Fabrication ==
Charge qubits are fabricated using techniques similar to those used for microelectronics. The devices are usually made on silicon or sapphire wafers using electron beam lithography (different from phase qubit, which uses photolithography) and metallic thin film evaporation processes. To create Josephson junctions, a technique known as shadow evaporation is normally used; this involves evaporating the source metal alternately at two angles through the lithography defined mask in the electron beam resist. This results in two overlapping layers of the superconducting metal, in between which a thin layer of insulator (normally aluminum oxide) is deposited.

== Hamiltonian ==
If the Josephson junction has a junction capacitance formula_1, and the gate capacitor formula_2, then the charging (Coulomb) energy of one Cooper pair is:

:formula_3

If formula_4 denotes the number of excess Cooper pairs in the island (i.e. its net charge is formula_5), then the Hamiltonian is:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is a control parameter known as effective offset charge (formula_8 is the gate voltage), and formula_9 the Josephson energy of the tunneling junction.

At low temperature and low gate voltage, one can limit the analysis to only the lowest formula_10 and formula_11 states, and therefore obtain a two-level quantum system (a.k.a. qubit).

Note that some recent papers adopt a different notation, and define the charging energy as that of one electron:

:formula_12

and then the corresponding Hamiltonian is:

:formula_13

== Benefits ==
To-date, the realizations of qubits that have had the most success are ion traps and NMR, with Shor&#x27;s algorithm even being implemented using NMR. However, it is hard to see these two methods being scaled to the hundreds, thousands, or millions of qubits necessary to create a quantum computer. Solid-state representations of qubits are much more easily scalable, but they themselves have their own problem: decoherence. Superconductors, however, have the advantage of being more easily scaled, and they are more coherent than normal solid-state systems.

== Experimental progresses ==
The implementation of Superconducting charge qubits have been progressing quickly since 1996. Design was theoretically described in 1997 by Shnirman, while the evidence of quantum coherence of the charge in a Cooper pair box was published in February 1997 by Vincent Bouchiat et al. In 1999, coherent oscillations in the charge Qubit were first observed by Nakamura et al. Manipulation of the quantum states and full realization of the charge qubit was observed 2 years later. In 2007, a more advanced device known as Transmon showing enhanced coherence times due to its reduced sensitivity to charge noise was developed at Yale University by Robert J. Schoelkopf, Michel Devoret, Steven M. Girvin and their colleagues .

<text>Alan William Napier-Clavering (7 January 1903 – 8 August 1988), better known as Alan Napier, was an English actor. After a decade in West End theatre, he had a long film career in Britain and later on in Hollywood. Napier is best remembered for portraying Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler in the 1960s live-action &quot;Batman&quot; television series.

==Early life and career==
Alan William Napier-Clavering was born on 7 January 1903 in Birmingham to Claude Gerald Napier-Clavering, managing director of the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, and Millicent Mary, daughter of politician William Kenrick. He had two older siblings, Mark (born 1898) and Mary Helen- &quot;Molly&quot;- (born 1900). The Napier-Clavering family were landed gentry- the senior line owning Axwell Park near Gateshead until 1920- and descended from Francis Napier, 8th Lord Napier.

Napier was a first cousin-once removed of Neville Chamberlain, Britain&#x27;s prime minister from 1937 to 1940. He was educated at Packwood Haugh School and, after leaving Clifton College, he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1925.

Napier was engaged by the Oxford Players, where he worked with the likes of John Gielgud and Robert Morley. As Napier recalled, his &quot;ridiculously tall&quot; height almost cost him his position immediately after he secured it. J. B. Fagan had dismissed Tyrone Guthrie because he was too tall for most parts. Napier was interviewed (and accepted) as Guthrie&#x27;s replacement while sitting down. Fagan realized that Napier was even taller than Guthrie when he stood up, but honoured his commitment. Napier performed for ten years (1929–1939) on the West End stage. Napier described himself as having a particular affinity for the work of George Bernard Shaw, and in 1937 appeared in a London revival of &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; supervised by Shaw himself.

Napier made his American stage debut as the romantic lead opposite Gladys George in &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot;. Though his film career had begun in Britain in the 1930s, he had very little success before the cameras until he joined the British expatriate community in Hollywood in 1941. There he spent time with such people as James Whale, a fellow ex-Oxford Player. He appeared in such films as &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942), &quot;Cat People&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944). In &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), he played the ethically questionable psychiatrist who is hired to declare Bernadette mentally ill. He also played the vicious Earl of Warwick in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948). He performed in two Shakespearean films: the Orson Welles &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1948), in which he played a priest that Welles added to the story, who spoke lines originally uttered by other characters, and MGM&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), as Cicero. He appeared as Mr. Rutland in the Hitchcock movie &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964).

In 1949, Napier made an appearance on the short-lived television anthology series &quot;Your Show Time&quot; as Sherlock Holmes, in an adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;. In the 1950s, he appeared on TV in four episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and guest starred on Dale Robertson&#x27;s NBC western series &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;. He had a recurring role as General Steele on the 1962–1963 situation comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Charlie!&quot;

==&quot;Batman&quot;==
In 1965, Napier was the first to be cast in the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s faithful butler Alfred, a role he played until the series&#x27; cancellation in 1968. I had never read comics before [I was hired for &quot;Batman&quot;]. My agent rang up and said, &#x27;I think you are going to play on &quot;Batman,&quot;&#x27; I said &#x27;What is &quot;Batman&quot;?&#x27; He said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you read the comics?&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, never.&#x27; He said, &#x27;I think you are going to be Batman&#x27;s butler.&#x27; I said, &#x27;How do I know I want to be Batman&#x27;s butler?&#x27; It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard of. He said, &#x27;It may be worth over $100,000.&#x27; So I said I was Batman&#x27;s butler.

==Later life and career==
Napier&#x27;s career extended into the 1980s with roles on television, including the miniseries &quot;QB VII&quot;, &quot;The Bastard&quot;, and &quot;Centennial&quot;, and the drama &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;. He retired in 1981, aged 78.

In early 1988, Napier appeared on the late-night talk show &quot;The Late Show&quot; as part of a reunion of the surviving cast of &quot;Batman&quot;, despite being in a wheelchair. His co-star Yvonne Craig described the reunion show as overbooked, and when host Ross Shafer finally turned his attention to Napier, it was only to ask him a silly question, then cut him off abruptly as he was telling a story, much to Napier&#x27;s annoyance. Napier did not participate in the subsequent cast reunion held before his death.

==Family==
Napier was twice married. His second wife, Aileen Dickens Hawksley, was a great-granddaughter of novelist Charles Dickens. Hawksley&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage, actress Jennifer Raine, was the mother of former child actor Brian Forster, best known as &quot;Chris Partridge&quot; on the 1970s television show &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;.

==Death==
Napier suffered a stroke in 1987, was hospitalized from June 1988, and was gravely ill for several days before his death of natural causes on 8 August 1988, in the Berkeley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica, California. He was 85 years old.

==Autobiography==

In the early 1970s, Napier wrote a three-volume autobiography which was not published at the time because, as he joked, &quot;I haven&#x27;t committed a major crime and I&#x27;m not known to have slept with any famous actresses.&quot; In 2015, McFarland Press published the book under the title &quot;Not Just Batman&#x27;s Butler&quot;, with Napier&#x27;s original text annotated and updated by James Bigwood.

<text>George Engel (April 15, 1836November 11, 1887) was a labor union activist executed after the Haymarket riot, along with Albert Parsons, August Spies, and Adolph Fischer.

==Early life==
Engel was born to an impoverished family with three other children. His father, Konrad, a mason and bricklayer, died when he was one year old. His mother died when he was 12, leaving him an orphan. He lived for a short time with a foster family, but at the age of 14 was forced to look for work. He was apprenticed to a shoemaker, but was unable to afford the dues.

He travelled to Frankfurt and finally found work as a painter&#x27;s apprentice. He travelled around Germany working, and in 1868 opened a business of his own. He married the same year, but found that the economic conditions in Germany made survival difficult, and so decided to follow his boyhood dream of emigrating to the United States. He left Germany in 1872, arriving first in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in January 1873, where he worked in a sugar refinery. In 1874, he left Philadelphia and moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he later, in 1876, opened his own toyshop.

==Activism==

Working at a factory, Engel first became acquainted with socialism when one of his coworkers took him to a meeting of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. He soon joined. In 1878, a crackdown on socialist organizations led to the dissolution of the IWA, but Engel was instrumental in forming another organization, the Socialistic Labor Party of North America, and finally, in 1882 he joined the new International Working People&#x27;s Association.

==Haymarket Square==
On May 3, 1886, after hearing about the massacre at the McCormick Plant earlier that day, he attended a meeting at Grief&#x27;s Hall. This meeting, later dubbed by prosecutors the &quot;Monday Night Conspiracy&quot;, was used to prove that there was a conspiracy in the bombing at the Haymarket. A witness claimed that Engel had arranged a plan to storm and/or dynamite police stations and shoot policemen should trouble occur. Engel claims it was a meeting only &quot;in which it was proposed to give aid to any strikers if the police or the Pinkertons should attack said strikers.&quot;

The following night, May 4, as the bombing took place, Engel was not in Haymarket Square, but was at home playing cards. Nevertheless, he was arrested the next day and charged with conspiracy in the bombings. At 50, he was the oldest of the defendants to stand trial. He was convicted and was sentenced to be hanged. After hearing in 1887 that several letters had been written from Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab to Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby, Engel wrote his own letter asking the governor not to consider any clemency, stating that: &quot;not being conscious of any guilt, the powers that be may murder me, but they cannot legally punish me. I protest against a commutation of my sentence and demand either liberty or death.&quot; [emphasis in original]
==Death==
Engel was hanged with three others of the condemned on November 11, 1887. His last words were &quot;Hurrah for anarchy!&quot; His execution during the Haymarket affair helped result in the date chosen for International Workers&#x27; Day.

Engel was buried, in a plot marked since 1893 by the &quot;Haymarket Martyrs Monument&quot;, in the Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois.

<text>Adolph Fischer (1858 – November 11, 1887) was an anarchist and labor union activist tried and executed after the Haymarket Riot.

==Early life==

Adolph Fischer immigrated to the United States in 1873 at the age of 15. He became an apprentice compositor in a printing shop in Little Rock, Arkansas. Later, in 1879, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he joined the German Typographical Union and in 1881, married Johanna Pfauntz (they had three children – one daughter and two sons). Adolph and his wife moved in 1881 to Nashville, Tennessee, where he worked for his brother as a compositor for &quot;Anzeiger des Südens&quot;, a journal for German immigrants.

In 1883, he moved his family to Chicago, where he became a compositor at the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, a pro-labor newspaper run by August Spies and Michael Schwab. It was around then that he also joined the International Working People&#x27;s Association and the Lehr und Wehr Verein, a radical offshoot which was formed to teach workers to defend themselves.

==Haymarket Riot==

=== Pre-riot ===
After the riot at the McCormick Reaper Plant on May 3, 1886, Fischer attended a meeting at Greif&#x27;s Hall, on Lake Street, to formulate a response. This was the infamous &quot;Monday Night Conspiracy&quot; which prosecution used to prove foreknowledge of the bombing the following day. Also in attendance were George Engel and Godfried Waller, who chaired the meeting and who later testified for the state in return for immunity (Waller was also arrested after the bombing).

The meeting concluded with a plan for a meeting the following night in the Haymarket. Fischer was charged with printing handbills to announce the meeting. The first handbills, which were printed in English and German, contained the line &quot;Workingmen, arm yourselves and appear in full force.&quot; Spies, who had been invited to speak at the meeting refused unless this line was removed, so Fischer prepared another circular without the offending line.

=== Riot ===
Fischer attended the Haymarket meeting the following night and listened to speeches by Spies, Albert Parsons, and Samuel Fielden. Towards the end of Fielden&#x27;s speech, he went to a local saloon, Zepf&#x27;s Hall, which is where he was when the bomb and resulting riot occurred. After the commotion, he went home. He was arrested the following day. According to police he had in his possession at the time of his arrest, a loaded revolver, a sharpened file and a fulminating cap, used to detonate bombs.

===Trial===
The evidence presented against Fischer at trial consisted mainly of his role in the Monday Night Conspiracy and his role in printing the Haymarket circulars. His membership in the Lehr und Wehr Verein was also highlighted. Waller testified that Fischer had been the one who proposed the Haymarket meeting (Fischer claimed it was Waller) and that they should be ready to attack the police should there be any trouble. He also testified that Fischer had given him a bomb the year previously, which he stated used against the police. Another witness claimed that Fischer was standing with the bomb thrower at the time of the bombing.

Fischer was convicted with the rest of the eight and, except for one who were given prison sentences, was sentenced to death by hanging.

After two of his fellow defendants wrote to Illinois governor, Richard James Oglesby, Fischer pointedly refused to ask for clemency. He was hanged on November 11, 1887, along with Spies, Parsons and George Engel. His last words were, &quot;Hurrah for anarchy! This is the happiest moment of my life!&quot;

He and most of the other Haymarket martyrs are buried at the &quot;Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument&quot; in Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

=== Post-riot family life ===
After Adolph&#x27;s death, his wife Johanna and children returned to the St. Louis area, living near her brother Rudolph Pfountz in Maplewood, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

<text>Datura wrightii, commonly known as sacred datura, is a poisonous perennial plant species and ornamental flower of the family Solanaceae native to the Southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is sometimes used as a hallucinogen due to its psychoactive alkaloids. &quot;D. wrightii&quot; is classified as an anticholinergic deliriant.

==Taxonomy==
German botanist Eduard August von Regel described the species in 1859 from material collected in Texas by botanist Charles Wright, and named it after him. The correct spelling since is with one &quot;i&quot;, per ICN article 60C.2.

The scientific name has frequently been given as &quot;Datura meteloides&quot; Dunal, but this name is actually a synonym of &quot;D. innoxia&quot; Mill., a Mexican plant with a narrower flower having 10 rather than five &quot;teeth&quot; at the rim.

Common names in the US include &quot;sacred thorn-apple&quot; or &quot;hairy thornapple&quot;, and sometimes &quot;western Jimson weed&quot; because of its resemblance to &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; due to both species having toothed leaves. Anglophone settlers in California often called it &quot;Indian whiskey&quot; because of its ritual intoxicating use by many tribes; the name &quot;sacred datura&quot; has the same origin. Other common names include &quot;Indian apple&quot;, &quot;California jimson weed&quot; and &quot;nightshade&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Solanum&quot;). The Tongva call it &quot;manit&quot; and the Chumash &quot;momoy&quot;. In Mexico, people call this and similar species &quot;tolguacha&quot;. or &quot;toloache&quot;.

==Description==
It is a vigorous herbaceous perennial that grows 30 cm to 1.5 m tall and wide. The leaves are broad and rounded at the base, tapering to a point, often with wavy margins. The flowers are the most striking feature, being sweetly fragrant white trumpets up to long, sometimes tinted purple, especially at the margin. Five narrow points are spaced symmetrically around the rim. The plants often can be seen as a ground vine in habit, growing close to the ground and spreading in a very exposed environment with full direct sunlight (cleared roadside). &quot;D. wrightii&quot;, blooms from April through October. In clear weather, flowers open in the morning and evening and close during the heat of the day (depending on water availability); in cloudy weather, they may open earlier and last longer.

The seeds are borne in a spiny, globular capsule 3 to 4 cm in diameter, which opens when fully ripe.
In Europe &quot;D. wrightii&quot; has often been confused with &quot;Datura innoxia&quot; as both are hairy with hanging spined fruits. They can be differentiated by the hairs on the stems and stalks, which for &quot;D. wrightii&quot; are densely appressed (visually and in photos this makes the stems look near-uniformly dull) and for &quot;D. innoxia&quot; projecting (making the stems dull at the edges and brighter, greener or shiny along the centre where the hairs project toward the eye). The flowers of &quot;D. wrightii&quot; are larger (14-26 cm) and have 5 cusps, with stigmas above the anthers often exserted, vs. &quot;D. innoxia&quot; smaller (12-16 cm) with often 10 cusps and stigmas below the anthers. and NSW Key

==Distribution and habitat== 
&quot;Datura wrightii&quot; is found in northern Mexico and the adjoining southwestern U. S. states, as far north as Eastern Washington, in open / disturbed land and along roadsides with well-drained (sandy) soils. However it is perhaps most naturally abundant in the region of Southern California. It is also commonly planted as an ornamental, especially in xeriscapes due to its ruderal characteristics.

===Invasive status===
In Australia, it has been recorded as a garden escapee in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.

==Toxicity==

All parts of &quot;Datura&quot; plants contain dangerous levels of anticholinergic tropane alkaloids and may be fatal if ingested by humans, livestock, or pets. In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell or cultivate &quot;Datura&quot; plants. Unlike other types of datura, the roots are considered the most potent and alkaloid-rich part of this species.

==Uses==
===Medicinal===
Among the Zuni people, the powdered root is given as an anesthetic and a narcotic for surgery. They also apply a poultice of root and flower meal applied to wounds to promote healing. The Zuni used &quot;Datura&quot; as a way to render patients unconscious while broken bones were set.

===Religious===
Southern California has been the site of various toloache (datura) based religions. &quot;Datura wrightii&quot; is sacred to some Native Americans and has been used in ceremonies and rites of passage by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother gave him a preparation of &quot;momoy&quot; to drink. This was supposed to be a spiritual challenge to the boy to help him develop the spiritual well-being required to become a man. Not all of the boys survived. The Zuni people also use the plant for ceremonial, magical, and divinatory purposes. The root pieces are chewed by a robbery victim to determine the identity of the thief. The powdered root is also used by rain priests in a number of ways to ensure fruitful rains.

===Recreational===
&quot;Datura wrightii&quot; has also been used to induce hallucination for recreational purposes. Internal use of the plant material can induce auditory and visual hallucinations similar to those of &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;, with the active compounds being concentrated in the seed capsules and roots; concentrations vary widely between samples, and onset is slow. This makes dosage estimation difficult and adds further risk to the administration of material that already has potentially lethal side effects. Scopolamine is the primary active molecule; it is related to atropine, with a similar, largely anticholinergic activity. Effects may include dry mouth, hyperthermia, profuse sweating, decreased sweating, impairment, drowsiness, restlessness, lethargy, illusions, changes in visual perception, delirium, psychosis and anterograde amnesia - along with the afore-mentioned hallucinations and sensory distortions. These compounds also induce a profound mydriasis and suppress eye saccades, resulting in considerable degradation of visual acuity, often to the point of functional blindness. This may persist, to a reduced degree, for days. The combined effect may result in a panic state in the user, a particularly dangerous situation in someone temporarily deprived of useful vision; users are prone to serious accidental injury. Scopolamine induces respiratory depression at hallucinogenic doses. The combination of anesthesia (in the hospital) and &quot;Datura&quot; is usually fatal due to combined respiratory depression. Seizures as well as fevers as high as have been reported.

==In popular culture==
The American artist Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe (1887–1986) painted &quot;jimson weed&quot; several times. She was fond of the flowers, which grew wild around her New Mexico house. These paintings of the exotic white pinwheel blooms, hugely magnified, are among her most familiar works. In 2014 one such painting sold for $44 million, a record price for a female artist&#x27;s work. Given the location of O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s residence in the New Mexico desert, it is likely that she saw &#x27;western&#x27; jimson weed.

The plant is an element of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s 1971 roman à clef novel, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream&quot;. In part 2, chapter 5 of the book, a jimsonweed experience is recounted by the character Dr. Gonzo as described here: &quot;Last Christmas somebody gave me a whole Jimson weed – the root must have weighed two pounds; enough for a year – but I ate the whole goddamn thing in about twenty minutes... Luckily, I vomited most of it right back up. But even so, I went blind for three days. Christ I couldn&#x27;t even walk! My whole body turned to wax. I was such a mess that they had to haul me back to the ranch house in a wheelbarrow... they said I was trying to talk, but I sounded like a raccoon.&quot; Due to the fact that Dr. Gonzo presumably lived in Los Angeles, California during this time, this encounter was likely also with the &quot;western jimsonweed&quot; species as well. It could have also been &quot;Datura innoxia&quot;, but since the author has passed, we may never know which he intended.

<text>Robert Douglas Bullock (July 10, 1929 – June 18, 1999) was an American attorney and Democratic politician from Texas, whose career spanned four decades. His service culminated in his term as the 38th lieutenant governor of Texas from January 15, 1991, to January 19, 1999, during the term of Governor Ann Richards and the first term of Governor George W. Bush. Bullock is among the last Democrats to win and/or hold statewide office in Texas.

==Early life==
Robert Douglas Bullock was born in Hillsboro in Hill County on July 10, 1929, to Ruth Mitchell and Thomas Austin Bullock, a Hillsboro city engineer and manager. Bullock graduated from Hillsboro High School in 1947 and attended Hill College, a junior college, in 1949. He served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War from 1951 to 1954.

Bullock graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor of Arts. He also graduated from Baylor University with a law degree in 1958.

==Political career==
After Bullock began his career in public service as a member of the Texas House of Representatives, he resigned in October 1959 to practice law and later served as general counsel of the Texas Automobile Dealers Association. He returned to public life when he was appointed Secretary of State of Texas, the state&#x27;s chief elections and records officer, by Governor Preston Smith. Bullock soon left the post to prepare for a statewide race for state comptroller in the 1974 Democratic primary. He served for four consecutive four-year terms. He was one of the last Democrats to win a statewide election in Texas.

==Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts==

In 1973, Bullock first sought the Democratic nomination for Comptroller of Public Accounts. The octogenarian incumbent, Robert S. Calvert, soon withdrew from the contest when he gauged Bullock&#x27;s strength. In November 1974, Bullock won the general election, defeating Republican Nick Rowe, a former Vietnam War prisoner of war. Bullock garnered 1,099,559 votes (71.61%) to Rowe&#x27;s 419,657 votes (27.33%).

Once sworn in as comptroller in January 1975, Bullock promised to modernize the office. During his sixteen years in office, Bullock pledged fair but aggressive audits. He made statewide headlines with a long series of &quot;raids&quot; on businesses that had collected state taxes from customers for many years but had not turned them in to the state. Bullock had pledged to secure these owed taxes; the officials collecting them were known as &quot;Bullock&#x27;s Raiders&quot;. As an outgrowth of his tax collecting efforts, that term entered the Texas government lexicon.

Bullock was also the first elected state official to adopt an equal opportunity employment program, a policy that Calvert had opposed. Also, Bullock was among the first elected officials to use computer technology in state government to cut costs and improve productivity. He was the winner of numerous national awards for his management skills, including the &quot;Leon Rothenberg Taxpayer Service Award&quot;. As comptroller, Bullock&#x27;s frequent and increasingly accurate forecasts on state finances allowed the legislature to budget more accurately. He also developed a &quot;Taxpayers Bill of Rights&quot; to guarantee fairness, courtesy and common sense.

Bullock was re-elected in 1978 virtually unopposed, garnering 1,288,320 votes (100.00%) since nobody bothered to run against him. In 1982 he defeated Republican Mike Richards, garnering 1,791,650 votes (58.02%) to Richards&#x27; 1,245,328 votes (40.33%). In 1986 Bullock had no Republican opponent; he defeated Libertarian George Meeks, garnering 2,416,658 votes (90.02%) to Meeks&#x27; 267,872 votes (9.98%).

Although Bullock refused to seek the governorship during the 1980s, he set eyes on the lieutenant governorship when on June 1, 1987, longtime incumbent William P. &quot;Bill&quot; Hobby Jr. of Houston announced that he would not seek a sixth term. Bullock quickly announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor in September 1987.

==Lieutenant Governorship==

In 1990, Bullock was elected Lieutenant Governor, having defeated the 39-year-old Republican nominee, businessman Robert Mosbacher Jr., of Houston, the son of the sitting United States Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher. Bullock received 2,002,360 votes (51.69 percent) to Mosbacher&#x27;s 1,741,893 votes (44.97 percent); he took office on January 15, 1991, as Democrat Ann W. Richards became the state&#x27;s second female governor. In 1994, Bullock was easily elected to a second four-year term over Republican Harold &quot;Tex&quot; Lezar; Bullock received 2,631,843 votes (61.48 percent) to Lezar&#x27;s 1,648,848 votes (38.52 percent). Bullock was inaugurated for his second term on January 17, 1995, while Republican George W. Bush was sworn in as Texas&#x27;s 46th governor, having unseated Ann Richards. Bullock did not seek election to a third term in 1998; he was succeeded by Republican Agriculture Commissioner (and later Governor) Rick Perry on January 19, 1999.

Serving as Texas&#x27;s 38th lieutenant governor, Bullock favored a hands-on management style that resulted in numerous achievements as the presiding officer of the Texas Senate. Bullock overhauled the ethics laws during his first term in an effort to restore public confidence in state government. He created the Texas Performance Review for the state comptroller to analyze spending at state agencies and recommended cost-saving alternatives. He helped consolidate all environmental agencies into one department in an effort to better serve Texans and protecting the state&#x27;s natural resources. As the state&#x27;s second-highest elected statewide officeholder, Bullock aggressively pushed through a constitutional amendment requiring voter approval before a state personal income tax could be enacted and requiring the money be earmarked for education, if voters approve the tax. He led efforts to modernize the Texas tax system and worked on state problems in tort reform, health and juvenile justice. Bullock was instrumental in finding a legislative solution to get Texas out of federal court lawsuits involving prisons and mental health. He was a leader in legislative efforts to revamp the state&#x27;s educational funding system and ushered through a law that created the state&#x27;s first comprehensive water conservation and management plan. As lieutenant governor, he professed a nonpartisan approach to lawmaking, often telling members of the Texas Senate to leave their politics at the door.

Bullock and Bush got along well, in part because Bullock got to lead an increasingly Republican legislature to agree to key laws and policies and, &quot;when they passed, Bullock and House Speaker Pete Laney allowed Bush to claim some credit.&quot; Bullock unofficially endorsed Republican Governor Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign even before it got off the ground.

At a November 8, 2006, post-election press conference, a reporter from the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, who had covered Bush&#x27;s tenure as governor, asked Bush if he thought then U.S. House Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi resembled Bullock. The President replied that the reporter&#x27;s question was an inside joke. The question was a thinly-veiled reference to the close working relationship between Bush and Bullock; the reporter apparently was asking whether Bush would be capable of forging a similar bipartisan relationship with the members of the new Democratic legislative majority in the U.S. Congress.

Bullock was renowned for his blunt and sometimes politically incorrect speaking style, but also for his trademark closing line &quot;God bless Texas&quot;. A lover of Texas history, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Texas State History Museum, located just to the north of the State Capitol in Austin. Opened to the public on April 21, 2001 (San Jacinto Day) after Bullock&#x27;s death, it was named in his honor. The second-floor lobby of the museum features a seven-foot-tall bronze statue of Bullock holding a giant gavel, next to a gallery of items and a video from his career in politics.

His political papers are housed in the Baylor Collection of Political Materials.

==Personal life==


Bullock&#x27;s adult life was marred by alcoholism and divorce; he had a total of five marriages, although at least one of them was a repeat. He stopped drinking in 1981 and remained active with Alcoholics Anonymous for the remainder of his life.

He married Amelia J. Hooks of Itasca in 1950 and divorced in 1978. He married Jan Felts Teague of Austin in 1985. He had two children from his first marriage, Lindy Bullock Ward and Robert Douglas &quot;Bobby&quot; Bullock Jr. He also had another daughter from his second marriage, Kimberly Teague.

==Death==
Bullock died at his home in Austin of cancer on June 18, 1999, and is interred there at the Texas State Cemetery.

==Honors==
Texas State Highway Loop 20 in Laredo is named the Bob Bullock Loop in his honor. The Laredo Energy Arena is located just off the Bob Bullock Loop. The Texas State History Museum, located a few blocks north of the Capitol Building in Austin, is named to honor Bullock&#x27;s efforts in the establishment of the facility.

<text>William Clay Ford Sr. (March 14, 1925 – March 9, 2014) was an American businessman who was on the boards of Ford Motor Company and the Edison Institute. Ford owned the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 until his death. He was the youngest child of Edsel Ford and was the last surviving grandchild of Henry Ford.

==Early life and education==
Ford was born on March 14, 1925, in Detroit to Edsel Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay.

He graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, in 1943 and received a Bachelor of Science in economics from Yale University in 1949; he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, captain of the soccer and tennis teams, an honorable mention all American selection in soccer senior year, and winner of seven varsity letters as a collegiate athlete. Ford also served in the U.S. Navy Air Corps during World War II.

==Personal life==
Following the war, Ford married Martha Parke Firestone, the granddaughter of Harvey Firestone and Idabelle Smith Firestone, on June 21, 1947, at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Akron, Ohio. William first met Martha at a lunch in New York City arranged and attended by both of their mothers, according to the biography &quot;The Fords&quot;. Martha then was a Vassar student who had the college nickname &quot;Stoney.&quot; He was a naval cadet at St. Mary&#x27;s U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School from 1943 to 1945. By that time both families had acquired considerable wealth, and the matchup between the grandchildren of two empire-builders was reported by numerous news outlets. The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; called the Firestone-Ford nuptials &quot;the biggest society wedding in Akron&#x27;s history&quot; and &quot;the biggest show Akron has seen in years&quot; in numerous articles chronicling the event. The couple received gifts from F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover, media publisher John S. Knight, and Mina Miller Edison.

The couple had four children: Martha Parke Morse (b. 1948), Sheila Firestone Ford Hamp (b. 1951), William Clay Ford Jr. (b. 1957), and Elizabeth Hudson Ford Kontulis (b. 1961). As of 2018, his son William was the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Motor Company. He had previously been the chief executive officer and Chief Operating Officer of Ford. Their children Martha, Sheila, and William are Vice Chairmen of the Detroit Lions, while Sheila was announced to take over as principal owner and chairwoman in June 2020.

==Professional career==
After graduating from Yale, Ford worked for the Ford Motor Company, and briefly led the Continental Division. The Continental Division, however, was short-lived and merged with the Lincoln Motor Company shortly before Ford&#x27;s public stock offering. Ford redesigned the Lincoln Continental, a vehicle his father created; in 1955, the Continental Mark II was released. Only two pictures adorned his office wall, his father&#x27;s Continental and his updated Mark II.

In 1948, a year after Henry Ford&#x27;s death, Ford was appointed to Ford Motor Company&#x27;s board of directors. Ford was chairman of the board at the Henry Ford Museum, from 1951 to 1983. He was also involved in other historic properties, on the boards of the Wayside Inn and Seaboard Properties, which managed the Dearborn Inn and Botsford Inn. On April 10, 1952, an iron ore-hauling ship, the , was named in his honor.

He was Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Design Committee chairman for 32 years, from 1957 to 1989. He was on the board of directors for 57 years, retiring on May 12, 2005, including being chairman of the Finance Committee. His son, William Clay Ford Jr., was Ford Motor Company&#x27;s CEO at the time.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, Ford was the 371st richest person in the United States in 2013, with an approximate net worth of $1.4 billion. He reportedly owned in Ford Motor Company: 6.7 million shares of Class B stock and 26.3 million common shares; making him the largest single shareholder. In 2000 the company restructured and paid out a $10 billion special dividend. According to an article from 2000, incidental to a repurchase of outstanding shares: &quot;The Ford family holds all 71 million shares of the company&#x27;s Class B stock, along with a small number of the company&#x27;s 1.1 billion common shares. Under rules designed to preserve family control and drafted when the company went public in 1956, the family holds 40 percent of the voting power at the company as long as it continues to own at least 60.7 million shares of the Class B stock – even though the Class B shares make up only 6 percent of the company&#x27;s overall equity... Why does this exist? The Ford family owns all 70+ million shares of the Class B stock. It is a way for them to ensure they keep control of the company no matter how much stock they have to issue to avoid bankruptcy. Some argue that dual class structures are inherently unfair because you are decoupling ownership from voting power.&quot;

==Sports ownership==
A minority of the Detroit Lions since 1956 and team president since 1961, Ford took advantage of a power struggle between Edwin J. Anderson and D. Lyle Fife to acquire total control of the franchise by buying out the other 144 shareholders for $4.5 million, equivalent to $ million in . The Lions&#x27; board of directors approved the transaction on November 22, 1963. During Ford&#x27;s ownership, he hired sixteen head coaches while the team won 41 percent of their regular-season games, made the playoffs ten times and never appeared in the Super Bowl. 

Ford was known for his unwavering loyalty to certain players and individuals. From 1967 until 1989, Ford had Russ Thomas as general manager of the team that saw them win no postseason games in his tenure before he retired. The Lions won a playoff game in the 1992 postseason, the first and only postseason win under Ford Sr. When Ford Sr approached player-turned-broadcaster Matt Millen about becoming team CEO and de facto general manager in the spring of 2000, Millen initially responded by saying he wasn&#x27;t qualified before Ford responded &quot;You&#x27;re smart. You&#x27;ll figure it out.&quot; He rejected the offer only to accept when offered the position again the following year. The team went 31-84 from 2001 until Week 3 of the 2008 season before Millen was fired (that year, the Lions would lose every game of the season). The decision to fire him only occurred when Ford&#x27;s son came out in the media to publicly state that he would change general managers if he could do so. At the time of his death, he had the second-longest tenure among current owners next to Ralph Wilson. Ford was honored with a patch for the 2014 season. Three years later, the team went through a uniform re-design that saw Ford&#x27;s initials placed on the left sleeve of the jersey that stayed on until the 2024 season.

Ford also served as chairman of the short-lived Detroit Cougars (1967–1968), a professional soccer team, which played in the USA and NASL leagues.

==Death==
Ford died of pneumonia, five days before his 89th birthday, at his home in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, on March 9, 2014. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit, near his parents and elder brother, Benson.

<text>In broadcast engineering, a remote broadcast (usually just called a remote or a live remote, or in news parlance, a live shot) is broadcasting done from a location away from a formal television or radio studio and is considered an electronic field production (EFP). A remote pickup unit (RPU) is usually used to transmit the audio and/or video back to the broadcast station, where it joins the normal airchain. Other methods include satellite trucks, production trucks and even regular telephone lines if necessary.

==History==
The first airing of a remote broadcast came in 1924, when Loew&#x27;s Theater publicist and WHN (New York City) station manager Nils Granlund leased telegraph lines from Western Union to provide the first link in what became called cabaret broadcasting.&quot; By early 1925, Granlund had established remote lines between WHN and more than thirty New York City jazz nightclubs, including the Silver Slipper, The Parody Club, the Cotton Club, the Strand Roof, and Club Moritz. These big band remotes would become a staple of the old-time radio era, lasting well into the 1950s.

Nils T. Granlund cited the 1925 WHN airing of Senator James J. Walker&#x27;s announcement of his New York City mayoral candidacy through a remote broadcast from the New York Press Club as the first such remote link for a political forum.

In Latin America on 27 October 1920, Dr Sussini made the first remote transmission in Argentina from the theatre El Coliseo in Buenos Aires. In Mexico on 27 September 1921, Adolfo Gomez Fernandez made a transmission from the Teatro Ideal, Mexico DF

The very first live remote broadcast to the nation was by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1938 when Frank Willis reported on the Moose River Gold Mine disaster in Nova Scotia http://archives.cbc.ca/economy_business/natural_resources/clips/3860/

On 11 June 1955, NBC, The National Broadcasting Company, provided the 1st live remote broadcast to the nation from Niagara Falls, New York.

==Radio==
In radio, remotes are often used for special events, such as concerts or sporting events, where either the entire event or advertisements for the event are broadcast on location. The cost of personnel and equipment is usually paid for by the host at each performance. However, if the event is recurring, such as a weekly broadcast from a nightclub, then dedicated lines are usually installed by the local telephone company in order to save on costs. With low range radio stations, and at events with no telephone lines, several radio stations will call into the studio request line with a cell phone and microphone setup. From there, another DJ in the studio will put them on-location live on the air via the studio request line. Some stations use this method when doing live broadcasts in areas where the signal is weak.

Originally, analog audio broadcasts were sent through telephone hybrids, which, although low quality, were found to be acceptable for voice broadcasts. Later, frequency extenders were developed that used additional lines, shifting higher treble audio frequencies down on one end and back up on the other, providing a reasonable reproduction of the original sound. Currently, digital lines, such as ISDN or DSL, are used to send compressed digital audio back to the studio. In addition, modern remote pickup units have become extremely portable and can transmit single-channel monophonic FM-quality audio over regular telephone lines using built-in modems and advanced compression algorithms (MPEG-4, etc.). See POTS codec.

==Television==
In TV, live television remotes are an almost daily part of television news broadcasts in the U.S. As a part of electronic news gathering (ENG), remotes are meant to bring the audience to the scene of the action.

To get to the scene quickly, a live remote may be done from a helicopter.

Live television remotes may often be used in a manner similar to radio remotes (and vice versa) as well.

<text>The British Rail Class 47 or Brush Type 4 is a class of diesel-electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction. A total of 512 Class 47s were built at Brush&#x27;s Falcon Works in Loughborough and at British Railways&#x27; Crewe Works between 1962 and 1968, which made them the most numerous class of British mainline diesel locomotive.

They were fitted with the Sulzer 12LDA28C twin-bank twelve-cylinder unit producing though this was later derated to to improve reliabilityand have been used on both passenger and freight trains on Britain&#x27;s railways for over 55 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of traction, a significant number are still in use, both on the mainline and on heritage railways.

, 76 locomotives still exist as Class 47s, including 32 which have been preserved. 31 locomotives, including six which are preserved, retain mainline running certificates. A further 33 locomotives were converted to Class 57s between 1998 and 2004.

==Origins==

The Class 47 history began in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the British Transport Commission (BTC) to remove steam locomotives from British Rail by a target date of 1968. It therefore required a large build of Type 4 but with an axle load of no more than . The BTC was not convinced that the future of diesel traction lay down the hydraulic transmission path of the Western Region, and concentrated on diesel-electric designs.

Initially, the BTC invited tenders to build 100 locomotives to the new specification. The following responses were received:

*A consortium of the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, Associated Electrical Industries and Sulzer offered a production version of their D0260 &quot;Lion&quot; prototype under construction at the time, with both steam and electric heating
*Brush Traction offered three options; a production version of their twin-engined D0280 &quot;Falcon&quot; prototype under construction, or a single engine design using either a Sulzer engine or the English Electric 16CSVT, including steam heating with an option for electric heating
*English Electric offered a design based on the eventual DP2 prototype
*North British Locomotive Company offered a Sulzer-powered design with steam and electric heating

Of these bids, the BRCW/AEI/Sulzer bid was the preferred option, but before the prototypes could be assessed, the need to build a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount, and the BTC decided on a new approach: it decided to cancel the final order of twenty Class 46 locomotives and invite bids for twenty locomotives of the new Type 4 specification using the Brush electrical equipment intended for the cancelled order. Brush won the contract.

This initial build of 20 locomotives (Nos. D1500 to D1519) were mechanically different from the remainder of the type, using Westinghouse-supplied brake systems, and would be withdrawn earlier than the rest of the class which used Metcalfe-Oerlikon brakes.

Based on the success of these initial 20 locomotives an order for 270 was made, which was later revised upwards a number of times to reach the final total of 512. 310 locomotives were constructed by Brush in Loughborough, and the remaining 202 at BR&#x27;s Crewe Works. Five locomotives, Nos. D1702 to D1706, were fitted with a Sulzer V12 12LVA24 power unit and classified as Class 48s; the experiment was not deemed a success, and they were later converted to standard 47s.

===Orders===
The locomotives were ordered in 6 batches as follows:
* D1500–D1519, 28 February 1961.
* D1520–D1681, 1 January 1962.
* D1682–D1706, 4 September 1962.
* D1707–D1781, 28 September 1962.
* D1782–D1861, 22 July 1963.
* D1862–D1999 &amp; D1100–D1111, 24 March 1964.

==In service==
The first 500 locomotives were numbered sequentially from D1500 to D1999, with the remaining twelve being numbered from D1100 to D1111. The locomotives went to work on passenger and freight duties on all regions of British Rail. Large numbers went to replace steam locomotives, especially on express passenger duties.

The locomotives, bar a batch of 81 built for freight duties, were all fitted with steam heating boilers for train heat duties. The initial batch of twenty, plus D1960 and D1961, were also fitted with electric train heating (ETH). With this type of heating becoming standard, a further large number of locomotives were later fitted with this equipment.

In the mid-1960s, it was decided to de-rate the engine output of the fleet from to , significantly improving reliability by reducing stresses on the power plant, whilst not causing a noticeable reduction in performance.

==Sub-classes==
In the early 1970s, the fleet was renumbered into the 47xxx series to conform with the computerised TOPS systems. This enabled a number of easily recognisable sub-classes to be created, depending on the differing equipment fitted. The original series were based on train heating capability and were as follows;
* Class 47/0: Locomotives with steam heating equipment.
* Class 47/3: Locomotives with no train heating.
* Class 47/4: Locomotives with dual or electric train heating.

However, this numbering system was later disrupted as locomotives were fitted with extra equipment and were renumbered into other sub-classes. For an overview of the renumbering see the List of British Rail Class 47 locomotives. This section summarises the main sub-classes that were created.

===Class 47/0===

Originally numbered D1520–1781, D1837–74, D1901–59, D1962–99 and D1100 (later given TOPS numbers from 47001 to 47298), these locomotives were the &quot;basic&quot; Class 47 with steam heating equipment fitted. In the 1970s and 1980s, with steam heating of trains gradually being phased out, all locomotives fitted with the equipment gradually had their steam heating boilers removed. Some were fitted with ETH and became 47/4s, whilst the others remained with no train heating capability and were therefore used mainly on freight work. In the 1990s, the class designation 47/2 was applied to some class 47/0s and class 47/3s after they were fitted with multiple working equipment. The locomotives involved also had their vacuum braking systems removed or isolated, leaving them air braked only. This was mainly a paper exercise, however, and the locomotives were not renumbered; in this article they are included in Class 47/0.
===Class 47/3===
Originally numbered D1782–1836 and D1875–1900 (later given TOPS numbers from 47301 to 47381), this sub-class was originally built with no train heating equipment and therefore remained as freight locomotives almost exclusively for their working lives. They were all fitted with slow speed control for working MGR coal trains (as were a number of Class 47/0s). However, during the summer months when train heat was not required, 47/3s could regularly be found hauling the extra trains that the holiday season brought. The sub-type remained stable until withdrawals started, although an &quot;extra&quot; 47/3, 47300, was created in 1992 when 47468 had its train heating equipment removed and was renumbered. This was a direct replacement for collision damaged 47343. Also, 47364 was renumbered to 47981 in 1993 for use on RTC test trains.
===Class 47/4===

The designation for standard locomotives fitted with ETH and therefore used for passenger, mail and parcels use. The original batch of twenty locomotives (D1500–D1519) were built with dual steam and electric train heating, the electric heating being tapped from the locomotive&#x27;s DC generator. However, no more were constructed in this way until 1967 when the final two Brush-built locomotives, D1960 and D1961, were fitted with a new type of electric heat system using an AC alternator. Approximately 112 more locomotives had been fitted with this system by the time TOPS renumbering occurred (some of which retained the steam heat facility following ETH fitment whilst others had it removed at that time), and shortly afterwards the sub-class had settled down to 154 locomotives, numbered 47401–47547 and 47549–47555. Later, further Class 47/0s were converted to Class 47/4s and renumbered into the series from 47556 onwards, which eventually reached 47665.
===Class 47/6 and Class 47/9===

After being severely damaged in a derailment near Peterborough in 1974, locomotive 47046 was selected to be a testbed for the projected Class 56, and was fitted with a 16-cylinder Ruston 16RK3CT engine rated at for assessment purposes. To identify it as unique, it was renumbered 47601 (at the time the number range for Class 47s only extended as far as 47555). Later, in 1979, it was used again for the Class 58 project, fitted with a 12-cylinder Ruston engine (this time of ), and renumbered 47901. It continued with this non-standard engine fitted until its withdrawal in 1990.
===Class 47/7===

In the late 1970s, BR authorities identified a need to replace the ageing trains operating the Glasgow to Edinburgh shuttle services, in order to increase speed and reliability. The trains were operated by pairs of Class 27s, one at each end of this train. It was decided to convert twelve 47/4s to operate the service in push-pull mode. The locomotives would be known as Class 47/7 and would be fitted with TDM push-pull equipment and long-range fuel tanks, and be maintained to operate at . The conversions began in 1979 and the service was operated completely by them from 1980. In 1985, the push-pull service spread to Glasgow-Aberdeen services, and a further four locomotives were converted. The sub-class therefore comprised 47701 to 47716, though a further locomotive, 47717, was converted in 1988 after the fire-damaged 47713 was withdrawn.
===Class 47/7b and 47/7c===

In the 1990s, further 47/4s were converted with long-range fuel tanks and equipment to allow them to work with a type of rolling stock known as propelling control vehicles-PCV, which utilised RCH (Railway Clearing House) cables to allow the PCV driver to signal to the driver on the locomotive to apply power and operate the brakes - neither these locomotives nor the PCVs were equipped with TDM push-pull equipment. They were also numbered into the 47/7 series, from 47721 onwards. With dwindling passenger work for them, a number of 47/8s, already fitted with the extra fuel tanks, were also renumbered into this series.

Two locomotives, 47798 &quot;Prince William&quot; and 47799 &quot;Prince Henry&quot;, were dedicated for use on the Royal Train, and were designated as Class 47/7c. The two locomotives were replaced by a pair of Class 67 locomotives in 2004, and were subsequently withdrawn for preservation.
===Class 47/4 (extended range)===

The last of the original 47/4 conversions, from 47650 to 47665, were fitted with extra fuel tanks, giving them an extended range. Four earlier Class 47/4s were also converted. In 1989 it was decided to make these locomotives easily recognisable and so they were renumbered into their own series from 47801 to 47820. At the same time, further locomotives were fitted with extra fuel tanks and renumbered; the series eventually reached 47854. After the privatisation of British Rail, the locomotives in the 47/8 number range were mainly used by Virgin CrossCountry on cross-country work until the introduction of Class 220 &quot;Voyager&quot; trains. These duties have kept them maintained in serviceable condition, allowing them to remain operational longer than the majority of their classmates. As a consequence most of them received relatively recent overhauls. The locomotives in this number range are officially Class 47/4s under the TOPS system.

==Decline==
By 1986, only five of the original 512 locomotives had been withdrawn from service, all because of serious accident damage. However, with work for the class declining due to the introduction of new rolling stock and spare parts becoming difficult to source, some inroads started being made.

The first locomotives to be targeted were the non-standard pilot batch of 20, now numbered 47401-47420. Three locomotives were withdrawn as life-expired in February 1986 and the remainder of the batch that had not recently been overhauled followed in the next two years. All 20 were withdrawn by 1992.

Meanwhile, BR drew up a &#x27;hit-list&#x27; of locomotives for early withdrawal, mainly including those with non-standard electrical equipment, known as &quot;series parallel&quot; locomotives. In the outset, withdrawals were slow, mainly due to the surplus of spare parts and new flows of freight traffic which required extra locomotives; only 61 locomotives had been withdrawn by the end of 1992. However, with the introduction of new locomotives, the rate of withdrawal quickly rose, with 86 more 47s reaching the end of their lives in the next three years. With most of the non-standard locomotives withdrawn, the reduction of the fleet again proceeded more slowly. The privatisation of British Rail also resulted in new independent rail companies needing available traction until they could order new locomotives. From 1996 to 2006, an average of around fifteen locomotives per year were taken out of service.

During the decline in passenger work a number of locomotives were painted in &quot;celebrity&quot; colours, depicting various liveries that the type had carried during its history. This continued a tradition of painting 47s in unusual liveries, which dates back to 1977, when Stratford depot in East London painted two locomotives with huge Union Flags to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Fleet summary==

Mainline registered locomotives . This table does not include 47375, which was exported to Hungary in 2015. West Coast Railways is currently the largest operator of the type, though they began scrapping their stored locomotives in January 2023.

==Preservation==
There are 31 Class 47 locomotives in the ownership of preservationists and private railways.

==Class 57==
Thirty-three locomotives were rebuilt with EMD engines and re-classified as Class 57s. Freightliner took 12, Virgin Trains 16 and First Great Western five. Today these are owned by Direct Rail Services (17), Great Western Railway (4), Rail Operations Group (4), and West Coast Railways (8, including the prototype passenger engine 57 601).

==Accidents==
* 11 January 1965: D1734 was severely damaged after the freight train it was hauling ran out of control near Shrewsbury, eventually demolishing a signal box. It was withdrawn two months later, becoming the first Class 47 withdrawn after a working life of only eight months. Withdrawn in March 1965, it was cut up in April.
* 17 December 1965: D1671 &quot;THOR&quot; was derailed near Bridgend whilst hauling a train of empty coaches. Shortly afterwards, a freight train collided heavily with the wreckage, killing the driver and second man of this locomotive. D1671 was withdrawn in April 1966; its nameplates were salvaged, and transferred to No. D1677; and D1671 was cut up in June 1966.
* 8 April 1969: D1908 was badly damaged when, while hauling a freight train at Monmore Green, it was struck head-on by a passenger train that had passed a signal at danger. D1908 caught fire after the accident and became the third Class 47 withdrawn. The driver of the freight train and the passenger train driver were killed. Withdrawn in August 1969, it was cut up in October.
* 13 March 1971: D1562 was wrecked after severe fire damage at Haughley Junction while the locomotive was hauling a Liverpool Street to Norwich express. It was withdrawn in June 1971 and cut up in September.
* 11 June 1972: D1630 was involved in the Eltham Well Hall rail crash in which six people were killed. The locomotive was repaired, but much later in its life when numbered 47849, it was withdrawn from the Class 57 rebuilding programme after damage was discovered which was thought to have dated back to the accident.
* 25 August 1974: 47236 was hauling a passenger train that passed a signal at danger and was derailed at . Eighteen people were injured.
* 16 March 1976: 47274 collided with a lorry that had fallen from a bridge onto the line near Eastriggs. The drivers of both the train and the lorry were killed.
* 5 September 1977: 47402 was hauling a mail train when it was in a head-on collision with a diesel multiple unit at Farnley Junction, Leeds, West Yorkshire due to a signalling fault. Both drivers were killed and fifteen were injured.
* 22 October 1979: 47208 suffered severe damage in a fatal accident at Invergowrie in Scotland. It was hauling a Glasgow to Aberdeen service which collided with a local train which had stopped in front. The locomotive was withdrawn in January 1980 and cut up in April.
* 8 December 1981: 47409 was hauling a York to Liverpool express which derailed north of . Whilst the locomotive stayed upright, all the carriages derailed and carriages six and seven rolled down a steep bank. This resulted in 24 people requiring hospitalisation with nine of those being serious. One man later died of his injuries. The cause of the derailment was found to be a crack in one of the rails of the Up Normanton line.
* 9 December 1983: 47299 (formerly 47216) was involved in a serious accident at Wrawby Junction in Lincolnshire, when whilst hauling an oil train, the locomotive collided with a local train resulting in the death of a passenger. It later emerged that the locomotive&#x27;s renumbering was allegedly due to a warning given to BR by a clairvoyant who claimed to have foreseen a serious accident involving a locomotive numbered &quot;47216&quot;.
* 30 July 1984: 47707 &quot;Holyrood&quot; was propelling the 17:30 express from Edinburgh to Glasgow from the rear, when the train collided with a cow near Polmont and was derailed, resulting in 13 deaths. The accident raised serious concerns about the safety of push-pull operation where the locomotive was at the rear of the train.
* 20 December 1984: Summit Tunnel fire: Locomotive 47125 was hauling a freight train of petrol tankers which derailed and caught fire in Summit Tunnel, on the Lancashire/West Yorkshire border.
* 18 January 1986: 47111 was run into by a Class 104 diesel multiple unit which had a brake failure and had passed three signals at danger at . Forty-four people were injured.
* 9 March 1986: 47334 was one of two light engines that were hit head-on by a passenger train at Chinley, Derbyshire due to a signalman&#x27;s error. One person was killed. Lack of training and a power cut were contributory factors.
* 20 February 1987: 47089 &quot;Amazon&quot; was hauling a freight train that ran away and was derailed by trap points at North Junction, Chinley, Derbyshire. Another train ran into the wreckage and was derailed.
* 24 March 1987: 47202 was hauling a freight train that overran signals and was in a head-on collision with a passenger train (hauled by 33 032) at Frome North Junction, Somerset. Fifteen people were injured, some seriously.

==Miscellany==
In 1976, 47155 was moved to West Thurrock power station for use as a stationary generator while problems with one of the plant&#x27;s auxiliary generators were investigated. The locomotive was removed from its bogies and mounted on a heavy timber frame.

== Model railways ==
In 1976 Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 47 in OO gauge. 
Lima produced a range of Class 47 models in OO gauge. In 2009, Italian manufacturer ViTrains introduced their OO gauge model of the Class 47 in three liveries. In 2013, a BR Blue version of D1662 &quot;Isambard Kingdom Brunel&quot; was commissioned by Modelzone, based on Bachmann&#x27;s OO gauge model. The production run was a limited edition of 512 models.

In 2009, Bachmann released a British N gauge version of 47404 &quot;Hadrian&quot; in BR Blue. In 2010, Bachmann issued a British N gauge model of 47474 &quot;Sir Rowland Hill&quot; in Parcels Sector red and grey livery.

==Gallery of liveries==
==Cuba==
Between 1963 and 1966, ten locomotives similar to the British Rail Class 47 were supplied to Ferrocarriles de Cuba (Cuban National Railways). Although built by Brush, they were publicly stated to be supplied by Clayton Equipment Company.

<text>The Signia by Hilton San Jose is a postmodern high-rise hotel at 170 South Market Street in San Jose, California, located on the Plaza de César Chávez in Downtown San Jose. Constructed in 1987 as the Fairmont San Jose, it reopened as a Hilton hotel in 2022. The former south tower of the hotel is now a student residence for San Jose State University, Spartan Village on the Paseo.

==Description==
The hotel is a 22-story tower designed in postmodern style by Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum with Nishkian Menninger as structural engineers, with 500 rooms and 42 suites. It includes 65,000 square feet of meeting space, including a large ballroom. There is a fitness center and a rooftop swimming pool and deck with a specially designed windscreen to create a microclimate designed to be acceptable for sunbathing and swimming. 

==History==

The hotel stands on the site of San Jose&#x27;s first Chinese enclave, the Market Street Chinatown, which existed from 1866 until its destruction by arson in 1887. A plaque on the hotel&#x27;s exterior commemorates the racist attack. The hotel was planned in the 1980s as part of an urban renewal project funded by the Redevelopment Agency of San Jose, which also included the Silicon Valley Financial Center and Circle of Palms Plaza; it was developed by The Swig Company. Construction led to a hasty salvage excavation of artifacts from the former Chinatown.

The hotel opened on October 5, 1987 as the Fairmont San Jose, part of the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts chain. It was purchased in 1996 by Light Tower Associates, led by developer Lewis Wolff. In 2002, a 13-story, 264-room annex opened. Designed by Gensler and Associates and Moore Ruble Yudell Architects, This second tower was built on the site of the historic Hotel Montgomery, which was moved to the south and restored; it is now the Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown hotel. In January 2018, the Fairmont San Jose was sold to SJ SC Holdings, an investment group led by Eagle Canyon Capital.

On March 5, 2021, FMT SJ LLC, the then owner, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, closing the hotel while it sought a new management partner and extended the existing mortgage debt. The owner stated that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy had been less than 7%, and the hotel had lost at least $18 million in 2020 and was projected to lose at least another $20 million in 2021.

The hotel reopened in April 2022 as Signia by Hilton San Jose, a Hilton property with 805 rooms. The owners subsequently downsized, vacating the south tower annex and selling it in 2023 to Throckmorton Partners, a developer. That tower was converted the following year into a residence for San Jose State University students, Spartan Village on the Paseo, which opened in August 2024. The university is leasing the building for 25 months and will then purchase it.

On October 31, 2024, workers at the Signia ratified new labor contracts. This occurred in the aftermath of a three day strike which took place at the Signia over the 2024 Labor Day weekend in September.

<text>This is a comparison of both historical and current web browsers based on developer, engine, platform(s), releases, license, and cost.

==General information==
Basic general information about the browsers. Browsers listed on a light purple background are discontinued. Platforms with a yellow background have limited support.



==Operating system support==
Browsers are compiled to run on certain operating systems, without emulation.

This list is not exhaustive, but rather reflects the most common OSes today (e.g. Netscape Navigator was also developed for OS/2 at a time when macOS 10 did not exist) but does not include the growing appliance segment (for example, the Opera web browser has gained a leading role for use in mobile phones, smartphones, the Nintendo DS and Wii, and Personal Digital Assistants, and is also used in some smart TVs).
Both the web browser and OS means most recent version, example: Windows 11 with Internet Explorer 11.

==Browser features==
Information about what common browser features are implemented natively (without third-party add-ons).

==Accessibility features==
Information about what common accessibility features are implemented natively (without third-party add-ons). Browsers that do not support pop-ups have no need for pop-up blocking abilities, so that field is marked as N/A.

==Accessibility features (continued)==
Information about what common accessibility features are implemented natively (without third-party add-ons).

==Web technology support==
Information about what web standards, and technologies the browsers support, except for JavaScript. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the browsers or extensions that provide such functionality.

==Plugins and syndicated content support==
Information about what web standards, and technologies the browsers support. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the browsers or extensions that provide such functionality.

==JavaScript support==
Information about what JavaScript technologies the browsers support. Note that although XPath is used by XSLT, it is only considered here if it can be accessed using JavaScript. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the browsers or extensions that provide such functionality, e.g., Babel.

<doc id="978056" wikidata="Q644459" url="?curid=978056" title="Vought">
<text>Vought was the name of several related American aerospace firms. These have included, in the past, Lewis and Vought Corporation, Chance Vought, Vought-Sikorsky, LTV Aerospace (part of Ling-Temco-Vought), Vought Aircraft Companies, and Vought Aircraft Industries.

The first incarnation of Vought was established by Chance M. Vought and Birdseye Lewis in 1917. In 1928, it was acquired by United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, which a few years later became United Aircraft Corporation; this was the first of many reorganizations and buyouts. During the 1920s and 1930s, Vought Aircraft and Chance Vought specialized in carrier-based aircraft for the United States Navy, by far its biggest customer. Chance Vought produced thousands of planes during World War II, including the F4U Corsair.

Vought became independent again in 1954, and was purchased by Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) in 1961. The company designed and produced a variety of planes and missiles throughout the Cold War. Vought was sold from LTV and owned in various degrees by the Carlyle Group and Northrop Grumman in the early 1990s. It was then fully bought by Carlyle, renamed Vought Aircraft Industries, with headquarters in Dallas, Texas. In June 2010, the Carlyle Group sold Vought to the Triumph Group.

==History==

===Chance Vought years 1917–1928===

In 1917, the Lewis and Vought Corporation was founded by Lewis, an early aviator, and Vought, a former chief engineer of the Wright Company. They sought to take advantage of the growing field of military and civilian aviation after World War I. Operations began in Astoria, New York; in 1919, they moved to Long Island City, New York. After Lewis retired in 1922, it was renamed the Chance Vought Corporation.

Vought made history in 1922 when the Vought VE-7 trainer made the first takeoff from the deck of the USS &quot;Langley&quot;, the first American aircraft carrier. Later came the VE-11 naval fighter and the Vought O2U Corsair, the first of the Corsair aircraft.

In 1928, the company was acquired by the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, but stayed its own separate division among the lines of Pratt &amp; Whitney and Boeing. Vought died from sepsis in 1930, having seen his company produce a variety of fighters, trainers, flying boats, and surveillance aircraft for the United States Navy and the United States Army Air Service.

=== 1930s–1960===

Despite the Great Depression, Vought continued to design and manufacture aircraft at a growing pace. Soon after Chance Vought&#x27;s death in 1930, the company moved its operations to East Hartford, Connecticut. Under the Air Mail Act of 1934, United Aircraft and Transportation Corp. was forced by law to divide its businesses, resulting in Boeing Aircraft, United Airlines, and the United Aircraft Corp, of which Vought was a part. In 1939, United Aircraft moved Vought to Stratford, Connecticut, where it merged with the Sikorsky division to become Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft.

Chief engineer Rex Beisel began in 1938 to develop the XF4U, recognized by its distinctive inverted gull wings. After its first flight, in 1940, thousands of F4U Corsairs were produced for the Navy and Marines in World War II. By the end of its production in 1952, Vought, Goodyear, and Brewster had all produced the Corsair fighters. Vought was reestablished as a separate division in United Aircraft in 1942.

In postwar 1949, Vought moved operations to the former North American Aviation &quot;B&quot; plant in Dallas, Texas. The move was pushed by the Navy, who believed that having both of its main aircraft suppliers on the East Coast was an unnecessary risk. Vought moved 27 million pounds of equipment and 1,300 employees in 14 months, a record-breaking industrial move at the time.

In 1954, the company separated from United Aircraft and became the independent Chance Vought Aircraft Inc.

Vought began making its F-8 Crusader for the Navy in 1957; it was one of the Navy&#x27;s first supersonic fighters and its last all-gun fighter. The same basic design was later heavily revised and shortened to produce Vought&#x27;s A-7 Corsair II, a carrier-borne close-air-support and attack plane. Entering service in 1965, the Corsair II was heavily engaged in a close support and strike missions during the Vietnam War, beginning in 1967. The A-7 also participated in the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983; a punitive raid on Syrian missile sites in 1983; reprisal raids against Libya during Operation El Dorado Canyon in 1986; strikes against Iranian coastal platforms and naval forces during Operation Praying Mantis in 1988; support of the 1989 invasion of Panama; and throughout operations during Desert Storm in 1991. The A-7A, A-7B, A-7C and A-7E served with the US Navy while the A-7D was purchased by the US Air Force and Air National Guard. Two-seat models known as TA-7C/Es served with the U.S. Navy while the US Air Force purchased the TA-7K. The A-7 served in limited numbers with three foreign air forces, including Greece (A-7H/TA-7H), Portugal (A-7P/TA-7P) and Thailand (ex-USN A-7E/TA-7E).

===LTV acquisition 1960–1990===


IN 1962, Vought was bought by James Ling, who formed a conglomerate dubbed Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV). Vought Aeronautics and Vought Missiles and Space continued to develop and produce for the Air Force and Navy under the umbrella of LTV Aerospace.

The first of two decades of reorganizations began in 1972 with the creation of Vought Systems by the merging of the Vought Missiles and Space and Aeronautics divisions. All of LTV Aerospace was renamed the Vought Corporation in 1976, but by 1983 the Vought company was again split along aeronautic and missile lines under LTV Aerospace and Defense.

By the early 1980s, LTV was struggling, and Vought laid off many employees. 

In 1992, LTV sold Vought to Northrop and the Carlyle Group, each owning roughly half of the company. It sold the missile division to the Loral Corporation, part of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control.

===1990s to present===

Northrop Grumman, the successor to Northrop and Grumman, bought the Carlyle Group&#x27;s Vought interest for $130 million in 1994. 

In 2000, Carlyle Group established Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. It is primarily an aerostructures subcontractor. Vought is heavily involved in the Boeing 747, Boeing 787 aircraft as well as supplying parts for the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II and the V-22 Osprey. In July 2003, the Aerostructures Corp., owned by the Carlyle Group and based in Nashville, Tennessee, merged with Vought. Vought&#x27;s Nashville site supplies wing components for Airbus A319, A320, A330, and A340.

Boeing announced in July 2009 that it had agreed to acquire the North Charleston, South Carolina, facility of Vought Aircraft Industries, where Vought builds sections 47 and 48 of the aft fuselage for Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliner. Boeing agreed to pay $580 million for the facility.

In June 2010, the Carlyle Group sold Vought to the Triumph Group, an aerospace component manufacturer. The Vought acquisitions now operate as Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division. The Dallas/Grand Prairie facility was closed; operations moved to a new facility in Red Oak, Texas.

<doc id="978060" wikidata="Q3730937" url="?curid=978060" title="Ling-Temco-Vought">
<text>Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) was a large American conglomerate which existed from 1961 to 2001. At its peak, it was involved in aerospace, airlines, electronics, steel manufacturing, sporting goods, meat packing, car rentals, and pharmaceuticals, among other businesses. 

It began in 1947 as Ling Electric Company, later named Ling-Temco-Vought, followed by LTV Corporation and eventually LTV Steel until its end in 2001.

==History==

===Ling Electric Company===
In 1947, entrepreneur James Ling founded an electrical-contracting business, Ling Electric Company, in Dallas, Texas. He lived in the rear of the shop. After incorporating and taking the company public in 1955, Ling found innovative ways to market the stock, including selling door-to-door and from a booth at the State Fair of Texas.

===Ling-Temco-Vought===
In 1956, Ling bought L.M. Electronics, and in 1959, added Altec Electronics, a maker of stereo systems and speakers. In 1960, Ling merged the company with Temco Aircraft, best known for its missile work. In 1961, using additional funding from insurance businessman Troy Post and Texas oil baron David Harold Byrd, they acquired Chance Vought aerospace in a hostile takeover. The new company became Ling-Temco-Vought.

With low interest rates allowing the company to borrow huge sums, Ling built one of the major 1960s conglomerates. As long as the target company&#x27;s earnings exceeded the interest on the loan (or corporate bond), or the company&#x27;s price/earnings ratio was less than that of Ling-Temco-Vought&#x27;s stock, the conglomerate became more profitable overall. Given the fairly unsophisticated stock research of the era, the company appeared to be growing without bound, and its share price rose. 

In 1964, Ling turned Ling-Temco-Vought into a holding company and established three public companies as subsidiaries, LTV Aerospace, LTV Ling Altec, and LTV Electrosystems. LTV Aerospace received assets for Vought and a large part of Temco Aircraft. LTV Ling Altec contained Altec Electronics and other properties, and the rest went to LTV Electrosystems. The intention was to make the sum of the parts appear to be worth more than the whole. Ling used this technique to raise capital and buy more companies. Portions of LTV Electrosystems were later spun off to E-Systems, then part of Raytheon IIS, and since 2002, part of L-3 Communications-Integrated Systems (L-3/IS).

====Acquisitions====
In 1965, Ling added the wire and cable company Okonite. In 1967, they took over Wilson and Company, which was twice the size of Ling-Temco-Vought. Wilson was a diverse company involved in meat packing, sporting goods, and pharmaceuticals. Wilson&#x27;s president Roscoe Haynie was not aware of the takeover scheme until two weeks before the takeover was complete. Ling later split Wilson into three parts (meat packing, sporting goods (Wilson Sporting Goods), and pharmaceuticals (Wilson Pharmaceutical and Chemical), and spun them off into separate companies traded on the American Stock Exchange.

In 1968, Ling-Temco-Vought added Greatamerica Corporation, Troy Post&#x27;s holding company for Braniff International Airways and National Car Rental, and J &amp; L Steel. In addition, it acquired resorts in Acapulco and Guerrero, Mexico, and Steamboat Springs, Colorado. By 1969, LTV had purchased 33 companies, employed 29,000 workers, and offered 15,000 separate products and services, and was one of the 40 biggest industrial corporations.

====Conglomerate and antitrust problems====
Ling-Temco-Vought had a combined sales of $3.6 billion in 1969 ($ today), but investors found that the conglomerates were not growing any faster than the individual companies had before they were bought out. Share prices plummeted, sparking a bear market, and a general feeling arose that conglomerates were to blame for the market woes. An antitrust lawsuit was filed that year. 

Eventually, the board of directors demoted James Ling in 1970, and he left the company, to be replaced by former Ling-Temco-Vought executive Paul Thayer.

===LTV Corporation===
As part of a 1971 antitrust settlement, the company sold its Braniff and Okonite components, and Thayer changed the company name from Ling-Temco-Vought to LTV Corporation. Thayer was succeeded by former Xerox executive Raymond Hay.

====First bankruptcy====
In July 1986, LTV Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. With $6.14 billion ($ today) in total assets and $4.59 billion in debt, it was the largest bankruptcy in US history to that point.

The company went into a series of divestitures, most notably the entire LTV Aerospace division; the aerospace component retained the legacy Vought name as the independent Vought Corporation, while the missile component later became part of Loral Corporation and later became the Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control division. After the 1984 merger of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company subsidiary with Republic Steel Corporation, the company continued to exist primarily as a steel producer, renaming itself LTV Steel, and moved its headquarters to Cleveland, Ohio, in 1993.

LTV did not leave Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection until June 28, 1993, in what was described in 1999 as one of the longest and most complicated bankruptcies in US history.

In 1999, LTV acquired Pittsburgh-based Copperweld Corporation from Imétal S.A. of France.

====Second bankruptcy====
LTV Steel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, on December 29, 2000. The company subsequently dissolved on December 18, 2001. Its assets were acquired in February 2002 by Wilbur Ross and merged with Weirton Steel to form the International Steel Group.

Some of the railroad subsidiaries – Chicago Short Line Railway, Cuyahoga Valley Railway, and River Terminal Railway – went to ISG Railways, while the Ohio Central Railroad System acquired Aliquippa and Southern Railroad and Mahoning Valley Railway. The former Monongahela Connecting Railroad is now operated by the Allegheny Valley Railroad.

In 2002, Lombard Metals Corp, located in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, purchased all the outside inventory totaling 224,000,000 lb of steel from 58 locations throughout the country.

==Headquarters buildings==
A new office building was built at 1600 Pacific Avenue in downtown Dallas to house the operations of LTV, as well as a bank and other offices. The building opened in 1964. After LTV departed its offices there in the 1980s, the building went to other owners and various tenants before being repurposed in 2015 with a Hilton Garden Inn hotel on the building&#x27;s lower floors, while the upper floors were made into residential apartments. With reference to the building&#x27;s history and previous tenants, the apartments were dubbed the LTV Tower Apartments. The building&#x27;s new owners used the letters of the name to create a promotional tagline for the property: &quot;Love The View&quot;.

LTV spent its later years in Dallas in a new complex, LTV Center, which opened in 1985 at 2001 Ross Avenue. After LTV departed its headquarters for Cleveland, the building was renamed the Trammell Crow Tower; it is now Trammell Crow Center.

<text>A church bell is a bell in a Christian church building designed to be heard outside the building. It can be a single bell, or part of a set of bells. Their main function is to call worshippers to the church for a service of worship, but are also rung on special occasions such as a wedding, or a funeral service. In certain Christian traditions, such as Catholicism and Lutheranism, church bells signify to people both inside and outside of the church that a particular part of the service (such as the recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer or consecration of Holy Communion) has been reached. The ringing of church bells thrice a day occurs in congregations of certain Christian denominations as a call to prayer, reminding the faithful to pray the Lord&#x27;s Prayer or the Angelus Domini. 

The traditional European church bell &quot;(see cutaway drawing)&quot; used in Christian churches worldwide consists of a cup-shaped metal resonator with a pivoted clapper hanging inside which strikes the sides when the bell is swung. It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious building, so the sound can reach a wide area. Such bells are either fixed in position (&quot;hung dead&quot;) or hung from a pivoted beam (the &quot;headstock&quot;) so they can swing to and fro. A rope hangs from a lever or wheel attached to the headstock, and when the bell ringer pulls on the rope the bell swings back and forth and the clapper hits the inside, sounding the bell. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by a rope which pulls the internal clapper against the bell.

A church may have a single bell, or a collection of bells which are tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung randomly by swinging through a small arc, or swung through a full circle to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing.

Before modern communications, church bells were a common way to call the community together for all purposes, both sacred and secular. In some Christian traditions bell ringing was believed to drive out demons.

==Uses and traditions==
===Call to prayer===

Oriental Orthodox Christians, such as Copts and Indians, use a breviary such as the Agpeya and Shehimo to pray the canonical hours seven times a day while facing in the eastward direction; church bells are tolled, especially in monasteries, to mark these seven fixed prayer times.

In Christianity, some churches ring their church bells from belltowers three times a day, at 9 am, noon and 3 pm to summon the Christian faithful to recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer; the injunction to pray the Lord&#x27;s prayer thrice daily was given in &quot;Didache&quot; 8, 2 f., which, in turn, was influenced by the Jewish practice of praying thrice daily found in the Old Testament, specifically in , which suggests &quot;morning and evening plus at noon&quot;, and , in which the prophet Daniel prays thrice a day. The early Christians thus came to pray the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at 9 am, noon and 3 pm.
Many Catholic Christian churches ring their bells thrice a day, at 6 am, noon, and 6 pm to call the faithful to recite the Angelus, a prayer recited in honour of the Incarnation of God.

Some Protestant Christian Churches ring church bells during the congregational recitation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, after the sermon, in order to alert those who are unable to be present to &quot;unite themselves in spirit with the congregation&quot;.

In many historic Christian Churches, church bells are also rung on All Hallows&#x27; Eve, as well as during the processions of Candlemas and Palm Sunday; the only time of the Christian Year when church bells are not rung include Maundy Thursday through the Easter Vigil. The Christian tradition of the ringing of church bells from a belltower is analogous to the Islamic tradition of the adhan from a minaret.

===Call to worship===
Most Christian denominations ring church bells to call the faithful to worship, signalling the start of a Mass or service of worship. 

In the United Kingdom predominantly in the Anglican church, there is a strong tradition of change ringing on full-circle tower bells for about half an hour before a service. This originated from the early 17th century when bell ringers found that swinging a bell through a large arc gave more control over the time between successive strikes of the clapper. This culminated in ringing bells through a full circle, which let ringers easily produce different striking sequences; known as &quot;changes&quot;.

===Exorcism of demons===
In Christianity, the ringing of church bells is traditionally believed to drive out demons and other unclean spirits. Inscriptions on church bells relating to this purpose of church bells, as well as the purpose of serving as a call to prayer and worship, were customary, for example &quot;the sound of this bell vanquishes tempests, repels demons, and summons men&quot;. Some churches have several bells with the justification that &quot;the more bells a church had, the more loudly they rang, and the greater the distance over which they could be heard, the less likely it was that evil forces would trouble the parish.&quot;

===Funeral and memorial ringing===
The ringing of a church bell in the English tradition to announce a death is called a death knell. The pattern of striking depended on the person who had died; for example in the counties of Kent and Surrey in England it was customary to ring three times three strokes for a man and three times two for a woman, with a varying usage for children. The age of the deceased was then rung out. In small settlements this could effectively identify who had just died.

There were three occasions surrounding a death when bells could be rung. There was the &quot;Passing Bell&quot; to warn of impending death, the second the Death Knell to announce the death, and the last was the &quot;Lych Bell&quot;, or &quot;Corpse Bell&quot; which was rung at the funeral as the procession approached the church. This latter is known today as the Funeral toll.

A more modern tradition where there are full-circle bells is to use &quot;half-muffles&quot; when sounding one bell as a tolled bell, or all the bells in change-ringing. This means a leather muffle is placed on the clapper of each bell so that there is a loud &quot;open&quot; strike followed by a muffled strike, which has a very sonorous and mournful effect. The tradition in the United Kingdom is that bells are only fully muffled for the death of a sovereign. A slight variant on this rule occurred in 2015 when the bones of Richard III of England were interred in Leicester Cathedral 532 years after his death.

===Sanctus bells===

The term &quot;Sanctus bell&quot; traditionally referred to a bell suspended in a bell-cot at the apex of the nave roof, over the chancel arch, or hung in the church tower, in medieval churches. This bell has been rung at the singing of the Sanctus and again at the elevation of the consecrated elements, to indicate to those not present in the building that the moment of consecration had been reached. The practice and the term remain in common use in many Traditional Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches.

Within the body of a church the function of a sanctus bell can also be performed by a small hand bell or set of such bells (called altar bells) rung shortly before the consecration of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ and again when the consecrated elements are shown to the people. Sacring rings or &quot;Gloria wheels&quot; are commonly used in Catholic churches in Spain and its former colonies for this purpose.

===Orthodox Church===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church there is a long and complex history of bell ringing, with particular bells being rung in particular ways to signify different parts of the divine services, Funeral tolls, etc. This custom is particularly sophisticated in the Russian Orthodox Church. Russian bells are usually stationary, and are sounded by pulling on a rope that is attached to the clapper so that it will strike the inside of the bell.

===Victory Celebration===

The noon church bell tolling in Europe has a specific historical significance that has its roots in the Siege of Belgrade by the Ottomans in 1456. Initially, the bell ringing was intended as a call to prayer for the victory of the defenders of Belgrade. However, because in many European countries the news of victory arrived before the order for prayer, the ringing of the church bells was believed to be in celebration of the victory. As a result, the significance of noon bell ringing is now a commemoration of John Hunyadi&#x27;s victory against the Turks.

===Other uses===
====Clock chimes====
Some churches have a clock chime which uses a turret clock to broadcast the time by striking the hours and sometimes the quarters. A well-known musical striking pattern is the Westminster Quarters. This is only done when the bells are stationary, and the clock mechanism actuates hammers striking on the outside of the sound-bows of the bells. In the cases of bells which are normally swung for other ringing, there is a manual lock-out mechanism which prevents the hammers from operating whilst the bells are being rung.

====Warning====
In World War II in Great Britain, all church bells were silenced, to ring only to inform of an invasion by enemy troops. However this ban was lifted temporarily in 1942 by order of Winston Churchill. Starting with Easter Sunday, April 25, 1943, the Control of Noise (Defence) (No. 2) Order, 1943, allowed that church bells could be rung to summon worshippers to church on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day. On May 27, 1943, all restrictions were removed.

In the 2021 German floods it was reported that church bells were rung to warn inhabitants of coming floods. In Beyenburg in Wuppertal the last friar of Steinhaus Abbey rang the storm bells after other systems failed. Some church bells are being used in England for similar purposes.

==Design and ringing technique==


Christian church bells have the form of a cup-shaped cast metal resonator with a flared thickened rim, and a pivoted &quot;clapper&quot; hanging from its centre inside. It is usually mounted high in a bell tower on top of the church, so it can be heard by the surrounding community. The bell is suspended from a headstock which can swing on bearings. A rope is tied to a wheel or lever on the headstock, and hangs down to the bell ringer. To ring the bell, the ringer pulls on the rope, swinging the bell. The motion causes the clapper to strike the inside of the bell rim as it swings, thereby sounding the bell. Some bells have full-circle wheels, which is used to swing the bell through a larger arc, such as in the United Kingdom where full- circle ringing is practised.

Bells which are not swung are &quot;chimed&quot;, which means they are struck by an external hammer, or by a rope attached to the internal clapper, which is the tradition in Russia.

==Blessing of bells==

In some churches, bells are often blessed before they are hung.

In the Roman Catholic Church the name &quot;Baptism of Bells&quot; has been given to the ceremonial blessing of church bells, at least in France, since the eleventh century. It is derived from the washing of the bell with holy water by the bishop, before he anoints it with the &quot;oil of the infirm&quot; without and with chrism within; a fuming censer is placed under it and the bishop prays that these sacramentals of the Church may, at the sound of the bell, put the demons to flight, protect from storms, and call the faithful to prayer.

==History==
Before the introduction of church bells into the Christian Church, different methods were used to call the worshippers: playing trumpets, hitting semantrons (wooden planks), shouting, or using a courier. In AD 604, Pope Sabinian officially sanctioned the usage of bells. These &quot;tintinnabula&quot; were made from forged metal and did not have large dimensions. Larger bells were made at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century by casting metal originating from Campania. The bells consequently took the name of &quot;campana&quot; and &quot;nola&quot; from the eponymous city in the region. This would explain the attribution of the origin of church bells to Paulinus of Nola in AD 400. By the early Middle Ages, church bells became common in Europe. They were first common in northern Europe, reflecting Celtic influence, especially that of Irish missionaries. Before the use of church bells, Greek monasteries would ring a flat metal plate (see &quot;semantron&quot;) to announce services. The &quot;signa&quot; and &quot;campanae&quot; used to announce services before Irish influence may have been flat plates like the &quot;semantron&quot; rather than bells. The oldest surviving circle of bells in Great Britain is housed in St Lawrence Church, Ipswich.

==In literature==
The evocative sound of church bells has inspired many writers, both in poetry and prose. One example is an early poem by the English poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon entitled simply, She returned to the subject towards the end of her life in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839 with , a poetical illustration to a picture by J. Franklin. &quot;How Soft the Music of those Village Bells.&quot;

== Controversies about noise ==

The sound of church bells is capable of causing noise that interrupts or prevents people from sleeping. A 2013 study from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich found that &quot;an estimated 2.5-3.5 percent of the population in the Canton of Zurich experiences at least one additional awakening per night due to church bell noise.&quot; It concluded that &quot;the number of awakenings could be reduced by more than 99 percent by, for example, suspending church bell ringing between midnight and 06 h in the morning&quot;, or by &quot;about 75 percent (...) by reducing the sound-pressure levels of bells by 5 dB.&quot;

In the Netherlands there have been lawsuits about church bell noise pollution experienced by nearby residents. The complaints are usually, but not always, raised by new local residents (or tourists who spend the night in the neighbourhood) who are not used to the noise at night or during the day.

<text>Candace Beebe Pert (June 26, 1946 – September 12, 2013) was an American neuroscientist and pharmacologist who discovered the opioid receptor, the cellular binding site for endorphins in the brain.

==Early life and education==
She was born on June 26, 1946, in Manhattan, New York City.

She completed her undergraduate studies in biology, &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1970 from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.

==Academic career==
In 1974, Candace Pert earned a Ph.D. in pharmacology from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she worked in the laboratory of Solomon Snyder and discovered the brain&#x27;s opiate receptor. 

Pert conducted a National Institutes of Health Postdoctoral Fellowship with the Department of Pharmacology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from 1974 to 1975. She conducted research at the National Institute of Mental Health from 1975 to 1987.

In 1983, she became the Chief of the Section on Brain Biochemistry of the Clinical Neuroscience Branch, the only female chief at NIMH.

She left to found and direct a private biotech laboratory in 1987.

Pert was a research professor in the department of physiology and biophysics at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

In her latter years, she was with RAPID Pharmaceuticals.

In 1997 she published her book &quot;Molecules of Emotion.&quot;

She appeared as one of the experts in Bill Moyers 1993 PBS video production, &quot;Healing and the Mind&quot;, and in the 2004 film &quot;What the #$*! Do We Know!?&quot;.

She died on September 12, 2013, in Potomac, Maryland.

===Peptides work===
Pert published over 250 scientific articles on peptides and their receptors and the role of these neuropeptides in the immune system.

She held a number of patents for modified peptides in the treatment of psoriasis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, stroke and head trauma.

One of her modified peptides, Peptide T, had been considered for the treatment of AIDS and neuroAIDS. A placebo-controlled, three-site, 200+ patient NIH-funded clinical trial which was principally concerned with possible neurocognitive improvements, was conducted between 1990 and 1995. It was found that the effect of Peptide T was not significantly different from that of placebo on the primary end points of the study - various aspects of brain function. However, Peptide T was associated with improved performance (memory and learning) in the subgroup of patients with more severe cognitive impairment.
A long-delayed analysis of antiviral effects from the NIH study showed peripheral viral load (combined plasma and serum) was significantly reduced in the DAPTA-treated group.
An eleven-person study of Peptide T effects on cellular viral load showed reductions in infected monocyte reservoir to undetectable levels in most of the patients.
Pert was developing orally active peptide anti-inflammatory treatments for pain and Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and studies for treatment of HIV persistent viral reservoirs.

==Lecturing and media==
Pert lectured worldwide on peptide and other subjects, including her theories on emotions and mind-body communication.

Her popular book, &quot;Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel&quot;, (Scribner, 1997) expounded on her research and theories.

She was featured in &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine (December 2001) as one of Washington&#x27;s fifty &quot;Best and Brightest&quot; individuals.

The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; profiled Pert in 2004:

As a mere graduate student, in 1972 Candace Pert discovered the brain’s opiate receptor – the cellular site where the body’s painkillers and &quot;bliss-makers&quot;, the endorphins – bond with cells to weave their magic.

Pert&#x27;s discovery led to a revolution in neuroscience, helping open the door to the &quot;information-based&quot; model of the brain which is now replacing the old &quot;structuralist&quot; model...

&quot;Molecules of Emotion&quot; begins as an eye-opener into the intellectual warfare of modern scientific discovery – the gamesmanship, the sly purloining of others&#x27; results – but also into the round-the-clock work, the exhilaration of a shared breakthrough, and the slow, painful rise of women in the scientific professions.

The book concludes with the author integrating the science she pioneered with the holistic &quot;energy medicines&quot; which work on the same principles – till now without scientific rationales.
Pert&#x27;s experimental drug Peptide T is referenced as an alternative HIV/AIDS treatment in the 2013 film &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;.

===Event appearances===
* Pert was honored by the New York Open Center on November 7, 2006, for her &quot;leadership across the bridge between science and heart.&quot;
* Pert received the first time award of the Theophrastus Paracelsus Foundation in Holistic Medicine for her pioneering work in the area of psychoneuroimmunology (St Gallen, Switzerland) on April 12, 2008.

===Other appearances===
In 2004, Pert was an interview partner in the documentary film &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; where she appeared several times. She also appeared in the 2009 Louise Hay movie &quot;You Can Heal Your Life&quot;.

<doc id="978073" wikidata="Q4017859" url="?curid=978073" title="Walt Dropo">
<text>Walter Dropo (, &quot;Valter Dropo&quot;; January 30, 1923 – December 17, 2010), nicknamed &quot;Moose&quot;, was an American college basketball standout and a professional baseball first baseman. During a 13-year career in Major League Baseball, he played for the Boston Red Sox (1949–1952), Detroit Tigers (1952–1954), Chicago White Sox (1955–1958), Cincinnati Redlegs (1958–1959) and Baltimore Orioles (1959–1961).

==Youth==
Dropo&#x27;s Serbian parents emigrated from Trebinje, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now part of Bosnia and Herzegovina), to start a new life. His father, Sava, worked at the local textile mill while also running their Connecticut family farm. Walter was raised in Moosup, Connecticut, where he played sandlot baseball with his brothers Milton and George, and attended Plainfield High School in the Central Village district of Plainfield, Connecticut, before attending the University of Connecticut.

==College career==
While at the University of Connecticut Dropo played for the football, basketball and baseball teams. His college career was interrupted by World War II, and he served three years in the Army, including combat in Europe. Dropo left UConn as the school&#x27;s all-time leading scorer in basketball. Dropo was drafted in the first round of the 1947 BAA Draft by the Providence Steamrollers with the fourth overall pick. Dropo was also drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 9th round of the 1946 NFL draft.

==Professional career==
Listed at 6&#x27;5&quot;, 220 lb (100 kg), Walter turned down offers from the Bears and the Providence Steamrollers, in order to sign with the Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1947. He debuted on April 19, 1949, and in 11 games batted .146 (6-for-41). Before that, he played first base briefly for the Red Sox farm team the Birmingham, Ala. Barons of the Southern Association double-A League.

In 1950, Dropo led the league in RBIs (144) and total bases (326), while batting .322 and hitting 34 home runs, (second only to Al Rosen 37). In addition, his .583 slugging percentage and 70 extra base hits were second only to the .585 – 75 of Joe DiMaggio, and his .961 OPS finished third in the league, after Larry Doby (.986) and DiMaggio (.979). His efforts that season led to his only All-Star appearance. Dropo won the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1950, becoming the first Red Sox player to receive the award. In winning the award, he beat future Hall of Famer Whitey Ford, who finished second in balloting. Furthermore, Dropo finished sixth in the American League Most Valuable Player award.

In 1951, Dropo fractured his right wrist and never had another season the equal of his 1950 campaign. After another one-plus season, he was traded to Detroit on June 3, 1952. After being traded, he collected 12 consecutive hits to tie the MLB record. Included in the streak was a 5-for-5 game against the Yankees (July 14) and a 4-for-4 performance in the first game of a doubleheader against Washington (July 15). In the second game, he went 4-for-5, hitting on his first three at bats and popping out on his fourth at bat on the 7th inning, matching an American League record of 15 hits in four games. In that season, he hit a combined 29 home runs and 97 RBIs, but would never again hit over 19 homers (1955) or bat over .281 (1954).

In a 13-season career, Dropo batted .270 (1,113-for-4,124) with 152 home runs, 704 RBIs, 478 runs, 168 doubles, 22 triples and five stolen bases in 1,288 games. Defensively, in 1,174 games as a first baseman, he compiled a .992 fielding percentage.

==Later life and death==
After baseball, Dropo worked in insurance, investment brokering, the Dropo family fireworks business, and in real estate development. He was long active in University of Connecticut alumni affairs, and his family established the university&#x27;s first fully endowed scholarship.

Dropo died of natural causes on December 17, 2010, at the age of 87.
His funeral service was held at the Serbian Orthodox Church he helped found at 41 Alewife Brook Parkway, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was laid to rest at Evergreen Cemetery in Plainfield, Connecticut.

<text>A handbell is a bell designed to be rung by hand. To ring a handbell, a ringer grasps the bell by its slightly flexible handle – traditionally made of leather, but often now made of plastic – and moves the arm to make the hinged clapper strike the inside of the bell. An individual handbell can be used simply as a signal to catch people&#x27;s attention or summon them together, but handbells are also often heard in tuned sets.

==History==
Handheld bells have a long history. Credit for the development of the modern hand bell, or &quot;handbell&quot;, is accorded to brothers Robert and William Cor in Aldbourne, Wiltshire, England, between 1696 and 1724. The Cor brothers originally made latten bells for hame boxes, but for reasons unknown they began tuning their bells more finely to have an accurate fundamental tone and fitted them with hinged clappers that moved only in one plane. A foundry in Loughborough, Leicestershire, that originated in the 14th century became John Taylor &amp; Co in 1784.

Originally, tuned sets of handbells, such as the ones made by the Cor brothers, were used by change ringers to rehearse outside their towers. Tower bell ringers&#x27; enthusiasm for practising the complicated algorithms of change ringing can easily exceed the neighbours&#x27; patience, so in the days before modern sound control handbells offered them a way to continue ringing without causing annoyance. It was also more pleasant for the ringers to learn and practise in the warmth of the local pub rather than in a cold tower in winter. The handbell sets used by change ringers had the same number of bells as in the towers – generally six to twelve, tuned to a diatonic scale.

Handbells were first taken to the United States from England by Margaret Shurcliff in 1902. She was presented with a set of 10 handbells in London by Arthur Hughes, the general manager of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, after completing two separate two-and-a-half-hour change ringing peals in one day.

==Terminology==

The bells used in American handbell choirs are almost always English handbells. &quot;English handbells&quot; is a reference to a specific type of handbells, not to the country of origin. While some American handbell choirs do use bells made in England, the majority play bells made either by Malmark Bellcraftsmen or by Schulmerich, both based in Pennsylvania.

In the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between &quot;American handbells&quot; and &quot;English handbells&quot;; English handbells are traditional, with leather clapper heads and handles (such as the bells Whitechapel makes), while American handbells use modern materials, such as plastic and rubber, to produce the same effect (such as those produced by Malmark and Schulmerich). In America, however, they are all called English handbells.

==Characteristics==
The two major defining characteristics of English handbells are their clappers and ability to produce overtones. The clapper on an English handbell is on a hinge and moves back and forth in a single direction, unlike a school bell in which the clapper swings freely in any direction. It also has a spring that holds the clapper away from the casting after the strike to allow the bell to ring freely. Furthermore, the shaft of the clapper is rigid, such that the bell may be held with its mouth facing upward. The overtones on an English handbell are a 12th (an octave and a perfect fifth) above the fundamental, while Dutch handbells – such as Petit &amp; Fritsen – focus on the overtone a minor 10th (an octave and a minor third) or a major 10th (an octave and a major third) above the fundamental.

Handbells can weigh as little as or upwards of .

==Performance==

A handbell choir or ensemble (in the United States) or handbell team (in England) is a group that rings recognizable music with melodies and harmony, as opposed to the mathematical permutations used in change ringing. The bells generally include all notes of the chromatic scale within the range of the set. While a smaller group uses only 25 bells (two octaves, G4–G6), the sets are often larger, ranging up to an eight-octave set (97 bells, C1–C9). The bells are typically arranged chromatically on foam-covered tables; these tables protect the bronze surface of the bell, as well as keep the bells from rolling when placed on their sides. Unlike an orchestra or choir in which each musician is responsible for one line of the texture, a handbell ensemble acts as one instrument, with each musician responsible for particular notes, sounding their assigned bells whenever those notes appear in the music.

==Music==
Handbell choirs generally ring music composed or arranged specifically for handbells because of their highly resonant sound, the limited note range of a set, and the unique pitch-by-pitch division of the staff among the ringers.

There are several major publishers providing printed handbell music such as the Hope Publishing Company, The Lorenz Corporation and Alfred Music as well as free sites from individual composers and arrangers. Costs associated with handbell music typically result from shipping (many scores are only published in hard-copy) and dissemination; as most scores do not permit duplication and must be purchased individually for each ringer.

The coordination of the ringers requires a different approach than other ensembles. All the ringers read from a score. This score is similar to a piano score, but with an additional convention: The C above middle C and all notes below are always written in the bass clef, and the D above middle C and all notes above are always written in the treble clef. (This formatting is not always the convention for solo and small-ensemble music.) Handbells are a transposing instrument, meaning that they &quot;speak&quot; an octave higher than written (this is to help keep the notes centered on the staff), so a middle C bell is actually a C5 or &quot;tenor high C&quot;. (For simplicity, the bell would still always be referred to as middle C or C5). However some newer handbell music published today specifies to play an octave lower than written (meaning middle C sounds as C4 like on the piano) if the composer wants a bit more of a vocal character out of the handbells, or if the handbells are being used to accompany vocal choirs in order to not overpower the singers.

Due to handbells&#x27; relative rarity outside of the confines of church services—although less so now than in the 1980s and early 1990s—the majority of pieces last approximately four minutes. A few composers and arrangers write longer and more intricate works; generally these pieces use handbells in combination with other instruments.

==Ringing techniques==
To ring a handbell, the ringer moves it in such a way that the clapper strikes the inside surface of the bell, usually holding it against their shoulder, bell upwards, and then swinging the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting. The tone of the bell will continue to resonate, decaying naturally until it stops completely or the ringer stops it by damping the bell with a hand or on the body or a padded surface.

Handbell techniques have changed very much over the years. Donald Allured, founding director of Westminster Concert Bell Choir, is credited with fully realizing an American off-the-table style of ringing that includes many non-ringing sound effects including stopped techniques such as plucking the clapper with the bell on the table. He is also credited for promoting precise damping or stopping of the sound by touching the bell to a soft surface, in the service of more musical results.

===Multiple-bell techniques===
Normal ringing technique only allows a ringer to ring two bells at a time, one in each hand. Depending on the number of bells needed for a particular piece and the number of ringers, it may be necessary for each ringer to ring more than two bells at a time or in short succession (four-in-hand) There are also many techniques that change the sound of the bell as it is rung.

====Four bells====

There are two main ways of ringing two handbells with one hand: four-in-hand and Shelley.

In the four-in-hand technique, the ringer hold two bells in one hand with the clappers at right angles to each other. This allows the ringer to either move the hand normally (&quot;ring&quot; – primary bell) or ring knuckles-first (&quot;knock&quot; – secondary bell) to ring two bells independently with the same hand (for a total of four bells when ringing with both hands). The two bells can also be played simultaneously by holding the wrist at a 45° angle. In large ensembles, four-in-hand is typically used to ring multiple positions or pick up accidentals.

Shelley ringing is similar, except that the clappers are each orientated in the same direction, so that the two bells normally ring simultaneously with one movement. Shelley is typically used to ring notes in octaves, but can also be used to ring two notes separately by striking the primary bell sideways and the secondary bell forward in an action like tapping the fingers.

As to the relative merits of the two techniques, some believe that Shelley ringing is rendered obsolete when four-in-hand is perfected, while others believe that the motion of the clappers in the same plane makes certain techniques more feasible, particularly shaking, martellato and vibrato.

====Six bells====
There are several ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). One way is to pick two bells up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one&#x27;s little and ring fingers (a &#x27;triple Shelley&#x27;). All three bells ring together when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is to pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing them to play three notes in two hands.
Another method, called interlocked six-in-hand, can be set up by interlocking the handles of two bells so that the clappers move in the same direction (similar to the Shelley technique), rotating a third bell, and inserting it between the other two.

====Weaving====
Weaving is the technique of playing a succession of bells by changing which bell is in each hand as required. This is used by bass and solo or small-ensemble ringers. The large size and weight of bass bells makes four-in-hand ringing impractical and impossible, and often a solo or small-ensemble ringer will need to move up and down a range of bells, possibly sharing them with others. This technique means more than two bells can be rung in short succession, using the table to damp and free the hand to pick up the next bell. If the ringing sequence requires bells to be rung in tonal order, this technique often results in a weaving pattern as the ringer must often reach across their body for the next bell.
Weaving can also be used in combination with the four-in-hand in a technique called &quot;traveling four-in-hand&quot;. By combining the ability to hold two bells in each hand with the ability to quickly drop and pick up the secondary bell of a four-in-hand, a ringer has quick access to several bells.

===Other techniques===

There are other ways to play music besides traditional ringing. Other techniques include plucking, shaking (or trilling), table damping (or martellato), and malleting bells (on the table or suspended).

&quot;Echo&quot; technique adds a brief pulse of increased volume to a sustained note. This is accomplished by gently touching the rim of a vibrating bell to the table.

&quot;Gyro&quot; is a technique that involves holding the bell in a vertical position, then rotating it clockwise or counterclockwise slowly to create a small vibrating sound; this can also be done horizontally to push the sound outwards.

&quot;Malleting&quot; involves using one of several types of rubber, plastic, or yarn-wrapped mallet to strike the casting of the bell. This can create a staccato tone when the casting is pressed into padding, a normal tone when the bell is suspended, or even a drum-roll effect when multiple mallets are used or multiple hits on the bell are played. Suspended malleting can be employed to create a bell tree which allows many bells to be played by one ringer.

&quot;Martellato,&quot; also known as a table damp, creates a staccato tone and is accomplished by striking the bell into the foam in such a way that the clapper strikes the casting immediately after the bell strikes the foam. A variation called a &quot;Mart Lift&quot; is accomplished by lifting the bell off the table very soon after the clapper strikes. This creates a staccato tone followed by a softened sounding of the bell.

&quot;Plucking&quot; is accomplished by using the thumb and forefinger to force the clapper head into the casting while the bell is on the table with the handle toward the ringer, producing a staccato tone.

&quot;Shaking&quot; is accomplished by rapidly ringing the bell back and forth so the clapper strikes the front and back of the casting in quick succession. This creates a continuous sound, as opposed to normal ringing in which the tone decays rapidly after sounding. Because of their size, bass bells are rarely shaken. A suspended mallet roll is usually played if a shaking sound is desired on a bass bell.

The &quot;singing bell&quot; technique creates a sustained pitch similar to the sound a wineglass makes as its rim is rubbed with a wet fingertip and is accomplished in much the same way. A short wooden dowel is touched to the outside of the rim of a handbell which is being held in the other hand. The dowel is then used to rub the rim in a circular motion. The Singing Bell technique is adapted from the &quot;Singing Bowl&quot; tradition of Tibet.

A &quot;tower swing&quot; is when the bell is rung and then swung down and a bit behind the ringer and back up to the normal position. This creates an &quot;echo&quot; effect. The mouth of the bell must rotate around to create the sound change that resembles a tower bell. Usually this is done over a period of three or four beats.

&quot;Thumb damp&quot; provides a staccato sound similar to plucking or malleting on the table. This is often described as a &quot;tinkling&quot; sound. The bell is rung with a thumb and/or several fingers touching the outside below the rim; this damps the sound immediately after the bell is rung. This technique can often be easier than plucking or malleting with smaller bells.

==Notation==
There are a number of abbreviations and notations used exclusively or almost exclusively in handbell music:
*LV (&quot;laissez vibrer&quot; or &quot;let vibrate&quot;, similar to a piano&#x27;s sustain pedal)
*R (&quot;ring&quot;, regular ringing or meaning to end the LV)
*SK (&quot;shake&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; shaking the bell continuously during the duration of the note)
*TD (&quot;thumb damp&quot;, ringing the bell with a thumb on the casting to create a staccato note)
*PL (&quot;pluck&quot;, which means to throw down the clapper while the bell lies on the table)
*▼ (&quot;martellato&quot;, to strike bell against padding of the table, pushing the casting firmly against padding as to quickly dampen sound)
*SW (&quot;swing&quot;, to play the bell in a normal position, swing it down to the waist, then bring it back up)
*BD (&quot;brush damp&quot;, brushing the rim of the bell against the ringer&#x27;s chest to cause a quick diminuendo) and 
*↑ or (&quot;echo&quot;, ringing the bell and then touching it very briefly to the table, creating an echo effect).
*⨥ (&quot;mallet with handbell on table&quot;, to use mallets to strike the casting of the bell on the table, creating a staccato effect).
*+ (&quot;mallet on suspended handbell&quot;, to hold the bell upright and strike the casting with a mallet, creating the same sound as a normal ring albeit a softer strike).

==Handbell tree==

Handbells can be played as a handbell tree where the handles are interlaced within each other, allowing multiple bells to be played with mallets to obtain an undamped sound. This performance technique was invented by Louise Frier in the 1980s. It was further developed by Barbara Brocker who developed a standardized bell layout. It is used by many soloists. The notational symbol used for Handbell Tree features a series of interlocking diagonal lines, one for each handbell. The pitch is placed at the lowest point of each diagonal line.

<text>The classical TV series Young Person&#x27;s Guide to the Orchestra was created by orchestra conductor Leonard Bernstein, in 1960. Bernstein created the show for the purpose of exposing young viewers, mainly school-aged children, not just to European classical music, but to various kinds of orchestral instruments as well. It was a weekly show on CBS between 1958 and 1972. Then PBS picked up the show in 1972.

<doc id="978088" wikidata="Q2962831" url="?curid=978088" title="Cheshire Lines Committee">
<text>The Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) was formed in the 1860s and became the second-largest joint railway in Great Britain. The committee, which was often styled the Cheshire Lines Railway, operated of track in the then counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The railway did not become part of the &quot;Big Four&quot; during the implementation of the 1923 grouping, surviving independently with its own management until the railways were nationalised at the beginning of 1948. The railway served Liverpool, Manchester, Stockport, Warrington, Widnes, Northwich, Winsford, Knutsford, Chester and Southport with connections to many other railways.

==Formation==
The Cheshire Lines Committee evolved in the late 1850s from the close working together of two railways, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) and the Great Northern Railway (GNR); this was in their desire to break the near monopoly on rail traffic held by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in the Southern Lancashire and Northern Cheshire areas. The CLC operated in an area which included the rapidly growing major cities of Manchester and Liverpool, the developing Lancashire coal fields and the growth of the Mersey&#x27;s seaborne trade.

In 1857, the GNR and MS&amp;LR arranged to work closer together. The MS&amp;LR had just come out of an unhappy alliance with the LNWR and the GNR was motivated by the opportunity to gain access to Manchester, via the MS&amp;LR route from Retford. A joint MS&amp;LR/GNR service between Manchester London Road and London Kings Cross was provided and the arrangements were formalised by Parliament in the Great Northern and Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Traffic Arrangements Act 1858 (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. cxiii).

Relations between the LNWR and MS&amp;LR companies were never strong, but they deteriorated in 1859 when the MS&amp;LR supported several new railways in the Manchester area; two of which, the Cheshire Midland (incorporated 14 June 1860) and the Stockport and Woodley Junction (incorporated 15 May 1860) were to form part of the initial CLC.

In 1860, the MS&amp;LR was interested in three additional bills that would extend its influence towards Liverpool and Chester; they were the Garston &amp; Liverpool (incorporated 17 May 1861), the Stockport, Timperley &amp; Altrincham Junction (incorporated 17 May 1861) and the West Cheshire (incorporated 11 July 1861). Unfortunately, the MS&amp;LR was unable to fund the building of these railways by itself.

The shortage of funds led to a variety of negotiations, including the potential of a merger with the GNR, but eventually an agreement was reached on 11 June 1862 between the MS&amp;LR and the GNR. The arrangement was for the establishment of a joint committee to regulate and work traffic on four of the railways already authorised but not yet open. The lines were:
*Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway opened 12 January 1863.
*Cheshire Midland Railway opened in two stages in May 1862 and January 1863.
*Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway opened in December 1865.
*West Cheshire Railway opened on 1 September 1869.

Each company was to provide an equal amount of capital and four representatives to the joint management committee. This arrangement was confirmed by the Great Northern Railway (Cheshire Lines) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. cxlvii); this was the first official use of &quot;Cheshire Lines&quot; and at the time it was entirely appropriate as the majority of the lines involved were in Cheshire. This act had not, however, formally set up a separate legal body, providing instead for the two companies to manage and work the four railways through their existing structures.

In 1861, the two partners, MS&amp;LR &amp; GNR, had been authorised by the Garston and Liverpool Railway Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. xxxv) to construct the Garston and Liverpool Railway which made an end-on connection with the St Helens Canal and Railway Company at . This line opened on 1 June 1864 and ran for to a terminus at Liverpool Brunswick. This terminus station was only in use from 1864 to 1874, when it was superseded by Liverpool Central, but it did have an extended life as a goods station. The act included a short () line to connect a goods station, Wavertree Road (later Wavertree and Edge Hill), to the LNWR at Edge Hill and running powers from there to Garston.

Included within this act were running powers between Garston Dock and Timperley Junction using the lines of the LNWR through Widnes, Warrington and Lymm. and then the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&amp;AR) through to Manchester. The jointly administered lines at this time were known as &quot;The Liverpool, Garston &amp; Cheshire Railways&quot;.

Liverpool Brunswick station was inconveniently situated near the Southern docks, a good distance from the city centre. This necessitated the railway to transport passengers and their goods by omnibus into the city centre. To rectify this, the partners applied to build an extension railway and this resulted in the building of a difficult line, mainly in tunnels, to a new , with powers granted by the Liverpool Central Station Railway Act 1864 (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. ccxc).

The Midland Railway (MR) secured a route into Manchester city centre in 1862 and they began to look at options to secure traffic to the west of Manchester and particularly into Liverpool. This led to their associating with the MS&amp;LR and GNR and their partnership working of the lines mentioned above.

These lines were brought together under the direct joint ownership of the MS&amp;LR and GNR by the Cheshire Lines Transfer Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxxvii). They were:
*Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway;
*Cheshire Midland Railway;
*Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway;
*West Cheshire Railway;
*Garston and Liverpool Railway; and
*The Liverpool Central Station Railway.
The act additionally gave powers for the MR to join as an equal partner, which it did in 1866.
The MS&amp;LR&#x27;s and Branch Railway was transferred to the CLC by the (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cccli). This left a small section () of track between Apethorne Junction and Woodley Junction that still belonged to the Sheffield and Midland Joint Railway, with the CLC having running powers.
The Cheshire Lines Committee was finally authorised, by the (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. ccvii), as a fully independent organisation with a board formed from three directors from each of the parent companies.
==Manchester to Liverpool==
In 1864, Mr Edward Watkin, the MS&amp;LR&#x27;s chairman, proposed a more direct railway from Manchester to connect with the Garston and Liverpool Railway; this was mainly on the grounds that the existing arrangements for &quot;running powers&quot; on LNWR lines were inadequate. He had a point, as the lines were being used by three companies and had several curves that needed careful, and therefore slow, negotiation; there were 95 level-crossings and 60 or more signals in each direction.

This proposal was made in the name of the MS&amp;LR only, but Mr Watkin solicited support from the other CLC partners as it was in their interest, because of a competing potential alliance between the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) and the Great Eastern Railway (GER). This proposal led to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Extension to Liverpool) Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccclxxviii); this act was subsequently amended by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (New Lines) Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxcii) which altered the route slightly.

The result was two lines:
*one from Cornbrook, near Old Trafford in Manchester, where a connection was made with the MSJ&amp;AR to a junction with CLC (former Garston and Liverpool Railway) line near Cressington;
*the second from a junction with the first line at Glazebrook to a new junction, Skelton junction, with the CLC (former Stockport, Timperley &amp; Altrincham Junction Railway) near Timperley.

The other alteration to the route, promulgated under the 1866 act, was as the result of Warrington residents agitating to have the railway come closer to the town centre. The 1865 plan had Warrington station positioned to the north on the &quot;straight route&quot;, halfway between and stations in a direct line; this would have been about further from the town. A loop was constructed into the town and and goods yard was constructed on it. The loop and station opened in 1873; the direct route, otherwise known as the &quot;Warrington avoiding line&quot;, was not opened until 1883. In 1897 an impressive two-storey brick goods warehouse was built in the goods yard, superseding an earlier smaller structure.
A further MS&amp;LR act, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (Liverpool Extension) Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cxci), then formally transferred these lines into the CLC.

The direct line to Liverpool Brunswick was opened in 1873 and, from then, the CLC used this more direct route between Manchester London Road and . The route was further improved when Liverpool Central station opened on 1 March 1874, bringing trains into the city centre. The station was situated on Ranelagh Street on the edge of the city centre and was a much grander station of three stories with a large arched roof and six platform faces. At the same time as Central opened, Brunswick closed to passenger traffic; it became a goods station and a much larger warehouse was built around the original station building. The building was so large, about , it was long enough to write the owners names in full &quot;Great Northern, Manchester Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire and Midland Railways&quot;.

In 1879, a connection was made from the direct line to the expanding town of Widnes; the Widnes loop line ran from a junction between and to the south, through and back to join the direct line at . The line was jointly owned by the MS&amp;LR and the MR; the CLC ran a passenger service on the line. The loop line closed in 1964.

The building of the Manchester Ship Canal resulted in two diversions of the line in order to cross the canal at a high level on fixed bridges. The first was at Irlam where a diversion was constructed to the south of the original line and a new was constructed, both the old route and the diversion were operational from 9 January 1893 to 27 March 1893 when the original route closed. The second diversion was between and where both intermediate stations, and , were rebuilt on raised lines either side of the ship canal. Both routes were operational from 27 February 1893 to 29 May 1893 when the original route closed.

==Extension to Chester==
The Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway Company had been incorporated in 1865 to construct railways from Mouldsworth
to Mickle Trafford and onto , with a junction at Mickle Trafford connecting to the Birkenhead Railway.

This was a natural extension of the CLC network and indeed authorised, albeit by a different company, what the West Cheshire Railway had applied, and failed, to do in 1861. It brought access to the county town of Chester, an important tourist centre and gateway to North Wales to the expanding network. The Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway Company was transferred into the CLC on 10 August 1866 by the Cheshire Lines Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cccli).
Construction work did not start straight away, being delayed by contractual negotiations until 1871. The route was of double track with 23 bridges. There were intermediate stations at and . The railways, but not the junction with the Birkenhead Railway, opened for goods traffic on 2 November 1874 and for passengers on 1 May 1875. The junction at Mickle Trafford was made in 1875 to enable traffic between the CLC and but it was not used due to a dispute. The CLC ran five trains in each direction daily between which was a MSJ&amp;AR station and .

==Improvements in Manchester==
The direct route to Liverpool, and into Liverpool Central station from 1874, allowed an increased density of service with sixteen trains in each direction. These trains left Manchester London Road using the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&amp;AR) as far as Cornbrook, then crossing onto the CLC direct line. It was recognised early on that the additional services were going to cause congestion at the Manchester end of the line; at this time, London Road station had been expanded and effectively divided into several stations. The main station was split in half: one half for the LNWR and the other for the MS&amp;LR, which it shared with the Midland Railway. The third section of the station was the MSJ&amp;AR platform area, adjacent to the main station; these platforms were used as the terminus for passenger services, but the lines also provided a through connection for freight from Lancashire to Yorkshire.
Initially, the CLC obtained powers, in the (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. lvii), to build a new line long from Cornbrook into Manchester, &quot;with all proper stations, approaches, works and conveniences connected therewith,&quot; terminating on the southern side of Windmill Street.

This brought the CLC right into Manchester city centre and a temporary station, Manchester Free Trade Hall station, was opened on 9 July 1877. This station was a modest affair, with two platforms and two intermediate tracks, but it enabled the CLC to introduce an improved hourly express service to Liverpool taking 45 minutes which attracted passengers.
Even before the temporary Free Trade Hall station opened, the CLC had been authorised by the (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. xci) to build a permanent station; this station, which was opened on 1 July 1880, was immediately adjacent to Free Trade Hall station with its frontage on Windmill Street. This station had two storeys, goods below and passengers above; it had eight platforms, later increased to nine, six of which were covered by an impressive single span roof, the other two were protected by an awning on the side of the shed. Most of the station facilities, including the booking office and waiting rooms, were of wooden construction, being intended for temporary use but they lasted until the station&#x27;s eventual closure in 1969.

When Central opened in 1880, the Free Trade Hall station closed to passengers and was converted to a goods station; it had another warehouse added in 1882.

The Great Northern Railway (GNR) opened a goods warehouse adjacent to the former Free Trade Hall station, between it and Deansgate; the warehouse and its connecting line opened in 1898. The GNR worked goods trains into it from Colwick, using running powers over the Midland from Codnor Park Junction.

==Midlands connection==
The Manchester South District Railway (MSDR) was originally promoted by a group of local landowners, supported by the Midland Railway (MR), to provide a local railway between Manchester and Alderley. It was incorporated by the Manchester South District Railway Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. ccxxii), but nothing done by 1875 when the MR proposed that the section north of Stockport should become part of the CLC, thereby providing MR with access to Central.

At about the same time, in 1875, the construction of Manchester Free Trade Hall station was taking place; the authorisation for the permanent Manchester Central station had been obtained and the MS&amp;LR gave notice to the Midland to quit using Manchester London Road station within three years because of the congestion, as the Midland was a partner in the CLC it was natural for them to try to gain access to the new Central.

In 1876, with nothing much happening on the MSDR and the Midland Railway becoming increasing anxious to find station facilities in Manchester, the Midland proposed that the MSDR became a joint railway to be known as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies Committee (MS&amp;LR &amp; MR). A condition of the joint railway was equal funding of the capital to build the line; the MS&amp;LR was not forthcoming with their share and the Midland then petitioned for the undertaking to be transferred to its sole ownership, which was accepted. The Act also provided powers for the GNR to share in the enterprise, in which case the line would have transferred to the CLC; this option was not exercised, so it remained a Midland Railway line. The line from Heaton Mersey Junction to Throstle Nest Junction (later Throstle Nest East Junction), on the CLC near Cornbrook, opened on 1 January 1880. The Midland set up local services from Free Trade Hall to of 14 passenger trains each way, plus a daily goods train from Wellington Road goods; there were intermediate stations at , Withington, and . On 1 August 1880, MR switched its services from London Road to Manchester Central. When the MR was established at Central, they had 26 departures: the 14 South District local trains; and 12 trains for Derby, Nottingham, Leicester and London.

In 1891, the section from Throstle Nest Junction to Chorlton Junction (the junction with the MS&amp;LR line to Fairfield on the London Road to Guide Bridge route) was transferred to the CLC.

==Expansion on Merseyside==
Completion of the direct Manchester to Liverpool line, and the connections to it from Timperley and on to the Midland Railway, provided the partners with access to Liverpool without going through Manchester. The only connection the CLC had with the dock complex on the Mersey was at Brunswick, at the very southern end of the docks. Despite improvements made during the 1870s and 1880s and connections with adjacent docks from 1884, the CLC was not able to compete with other railways in the area for the large freight market. Both the LNWR and the L&amp;YR had better connections to the docks, both in terms of quantity and the quality of which docks they connected to.
To improve this situation, the CLC acquired of land at Huskisson in north Liverpool. To access this site, several lines were authorised by the (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. clxix). These lines, known locally as the North Liverpool Extension Line, were:
* Halewood to Aintree: facilitated by a north bound triangular junction from the Liverpool Extension Railway between Halewood and Hunts Cross stations to a junction with the East Lancashire section of the L&amp;YR at Aintree. The inside of these junctions provided space for an extensive array of goods sidings.
* Fazakerley to Walton-on-the-Hill and Huskisson: facilitated by a westbound triangular junction from the Halewood to Aintree line above. The inside of these junctions also provided space for another extensive array of goods sidings.
The lines were opened to Aintree Junction and Walton-on-the-Hill on 1 December 1879, with stations at , , , and . The section to Huskisson and station, for both passenger and goods trains, opened on 1 June 1880. A passenger service was provided from Liverpool Central to Walton-on-the-Hill, but it proved unpopular and thereafter most services terminated at Gateacre. When Huskisson opened, it too was provided with a passenger service that was even less popular: it was withdrawn on 1 May 1885 and the station closed. The line became known as the Liverpool Loop Line.

Huskisson goods facility became a large complex of warehouses and sidings, including cranes, stablings, cattle pens for up to 2,000 cattle, cotton and grain stores, offices and a turntable. There was a timber yard in Victoria Road and a lairage for a further 1,200 cattle in Foster Street, to cope with the cattle traffic from Ireland; much of which was on its way to Stanley cattle market near Knotty Ash station. A short () connection was made from Huskisson to Victoria Yard Goods (owned by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board) and Sandon and Canada Goods railway station (owned by the Midland Railway) in 1882.
The junction with the L&amp;YR was to the north of a further station, which opened on 13 July 1880 (becoming Aintree on 1884). This connection at Aintree provided an additional route onto the CLC for Midland Railway traffic, which had access from the north via Colne and Preston.

The Midland Railway made a connection at Fazakerley to its Langton Dock Branch and goods station in 1885.

The CLC established goods depots over the Mersey in Birkenhead; they opened depot on 1 July 1871 to the south of the docks and the East &amp; West Float depot at Duke Street in November 1892 to the north. Neither depot was connected to CLC lines, but were accessed from Helsby over the Birkenhead Railway.

The Mersey Railway completes a link from its former terminus at to a new station at Liverpool Central (low-level) on 11 January 1892. The railway did not connect to the CLC lines, but ran to an underground station accessed via steps from the upper station concourse.

==Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway==

An extension was connected to the North Liverpool Extension Line at Aintree in 1884; this line ran to . The line was independent but was operated by the CLC.
==Management==



CLC chief offices were originally at 45 Oldhall Street, Liverpool but were transferred in June 1865 to Alexandra Buildings, 19 James Street, Liverpool. They moved to Liverpool Central station when it opened in 1874.

In 1863, the CLC management committee was made up of four representatives each from its founding companies, which were the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) and the Great Northern Railway (GNR). The management committee (still at this time just MS&amp;LR and GNR) became direct owners and operators of railways, by the Cheshire Lines Transfer Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. cccxxvii). The Cheshire Lines Transfer Act 1865 allowed for the Midland Railway to become equal partners in the committee and they took up these powers in 1866; the Cheshire Lines Committee was now finally authorised as a fully independent organisation by the Cheshire Lines Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. ccvii). Now that the CLC had three parent companies, the management was divided by three with each partner having three places.

The committee first met at Manchester on 5 November 1863, where William English was appointed manager; his tenure lasted until 1882. He was succeeded on 1 October 1882 by David Meldrum, who unfortunately died in office in January 1904. In the interim, the committee was managed by Harry Blundell, the Engineer-in-Chief, and Robert Charlton, the Outdoor Superintendent. James Pinion took over in May 1904 and remained manager until 1910, although with reduced responsibilities in his last year before retirement. There followed another interim period, with Charlton and Blundell and the Indoor Assistant, William Oates, running the committee until a new manager, John Edward Charnley, was appointed in August 1911. He had the difficult job of managing the committee through World War I and the 1923 grouping where most railways were &quot;grouped&quot; into one of the &quot;Big Four&quot;.

Charnley was the manager from 1911 to 1922 when he became secretary and manager for three years until he was succeeded, on his death, by his assistant, William Howard Oates in February 1925. Oates also died in office after only a year and was followed by Alfred Percy Ross, who combined the manager&#x27;s role with that of Chief Engineer for a few years until July 1929. Sidney Burgoyne followed as manager in that December; he had come from the LNER and he returned there in 1932. The committee&#x27;s last manager also came from the LNER; Gerald Leedham was designated &quot;Acting Manager&quot; from January 1933 until 1936, when he became &quot;Secretary and Manager&quot; until the committee was nationalised at the end of 1947.
==Grouping==
The Railways Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5. c. 55) grouped most of Britain&#x27;s railways into one of the &quot;Big Four&quot;; however, a number of joint lines remained outside the Big Four and continued to be operated jointly by the successor companies. These included the Cheshire Lines Committee and it remained independent with its own management. Its management was still made up of nine directors, three from each parent company, and these companies had been grouped. The Midland was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), while the GNR and MS&amp;LR (by then the Great Central Railway) became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). This meant the CLC now had six directors from the LNER and three from the LMS.

The CLC continued under this management arrangement through the Second World War until the railways were nationalised under the Transport Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 49) at the beginning of 1948.

==Stock==
Although, in all other respects, the CLC was a complete railway, it did not own any locomotives. Its motive power was provided by the parent companies which, in practice, was the MS&amp;LR, as it had a comparatively close locomotive works at Gorton in east Manchester. The MS&amp;LR charged the CLC a mileage charge for each locomotive hire, depending on whether it was being used for passenger trains or freight. The directors of the other companies argued from the beginning that the CLC should have its own locomotives, as the hire charge was too high; this led to a reduction in the charge but not by enough to satisfy the GNR and MR directors. Eventually, the issue went to arbitration. Arbitration concluded that there was no viable alternative and the MS&amp;LR (later the GCR/LNER) would provide locomotives for CLC needs, albeit at a slightly reduced rate. The other companies would provide their own locomotives for their own through trains.

On the other hand, facilities for locomotives, the engine sheds, were provided by the CLC. Some of these provided facilities for all of the partners, others just for the MS&amp;LR. They were:


The CLC&#x27;s only contribution to motive power was the introduction of four Sentinel-Cammell steam railcars that were introduced in 1929; they worked all over the network until were withdrawn in 1941 and scrapped in 1944.

At the company&#x27;s formation, a small number of coaches were provided by the MS&amp;LR and MR jointly. However, an early management meeting recommended that the company have its own carriage stock and, from 1865, four-wheeled carriages were obtained from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd and the Railway Carriage Co. of Oldbury. As new lines opened, more carriages were acquired from the same places, the MS&amp;LR and the Ashbury Railway Carriage &amp; Iron Co.

Six-wheeled carriages were introduced when Manchester Central station opened in 1880 and the company then started to use bogie coaches; some of these lasting into the 1930s. Twelve-wheel bogie coaches were introduced from 1881 and were still being made in 1900; all of these coaches had varying mixtures of first, second and third class up until 1892, when second-class was abolished. Coaches were fitted with vacuum braking from about 1887 and some attempts were made with electric lighting about the same time; electric lighting did not become generally adopted until after 1900, the 1890s had to manage with oil gas.

At first, all CLC coaching stock was of MS&amp;LR design, but from 1900 all three owning railways supplied coaches of their respective designs. In 1904, the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company supplied some eight-wheel bogie coaches to the CLC designed by John G. Robinson of the GCR. These were of three types – thirds, third brakes, and lavatory composites. The livery was green, lined in yellow, with the lettering &quot;CLC&quot; at waist level. The last GCR-designed coaches built for the CLC, also designed by Robinson but this time built by the CGR at Dukinfield, were for the Liverpool-Manchester expresses, and consisted of nine five-coach trains.

The CLC had a total of 407 coaches in 1902 and 580 in 1923. New articulated stock was introduced in 1937, designed by Nigel Gresley and with a teak finish, for the Liverpool to Manchester service; they were in two trains each of four twins. The number of coaches seems to have been rationalised by 1938, with only a total of 284 coaches.

Similarly, the CLC had its own fleet of wagons, which were painted a pale lead grey for the bodywork, with black running gear and white lettering. There were 4,419 freight vehicles and 91 service vehicles at the end of 1922. In 1929, it was decided that all CLC wagons, other than brake vans and service stock, should be shared between the LMS, which would receive one-third of the wagon fleet, and the LNER, which would receive two-thirds. The transfers took place at the start of 1930, and the LNER was apportioned a total of 2740 wagons, of which: 1936 were open wagons; 551 were covered goods vans; 108 were bolster wagons; 104 cattle trucks; 27 refrigerator or meat vans; and 14 specially-constructed vehicles. The LNER supplied the CLC with some new brake vans, and these were painted in CLC livery, and lettered &quot;CL&quot;.

The CLC also owned some road vehicles – at the end of 1922, there were 90 lorries and 9 buses.

==Legacy==
The CLC routes between Liverpool and Manchester and between Manchester and Chester via Northwich survive. Several CLC stations remain in their original form and are listed buildings, such as , and . The CLC warehouse at Warrington is also a listed building, and has been converted to apartments.

Liverpool Central high-level has been demolished with local services on the former CLC line, operated by Merseyrail, running through an underground station on the same site. Main line services run to and from Liverpool Lime Street. Manchester Central closed on 4 May 1969 and is now the Manchester Central Convention Complex.

<text>A wallpaper or background (also known as a desktop background, desktop picture or desktop image on computers) is a digital image (photo, drawing etc.) used as a decorative background of a graphical user interface on the screen of a computer, smartphone or other electronic device. On a computer, wallpapers are generally used on the desktop, while on a mobile phone they serve as the background for the &quot;home screen&quot;. Though most devices include a default background image, modern devices usually allow users to manually change the background image.

The term &quot;wallpaper&quot; was used in Microsoft Windows before Windows XP (In Windows XP and later, it is called the &quot;desktop background&quot;). Meanwhile, macOS refers to it as &quot;desktop picture&quot;. On older systems that allowed small repeated patterns to be set as background images, the term desktop pattern was used.

==History==
The X Window System was one of the earliest systems to include support for an arbitrary image as wallpaper via the xsetroot program, which at least as early as the X10R3 release in 1985 could tile the screen with any solid color or any binary-image X BitMap file. In 1989, a free software program called was released that allowed an arbitrary color GIF image to be used as wallpaper, and in the same year the free xloadimage program was released which could display a variety of image formats (including color images in Sun Rasterfile format) as the desktop background. Subsequently, a number of programs were released that added wallpaper support for additional image formats and other features, such as the xpmroot program (released in 1993 as part of fvwm) and the xv software (released in 1994).

The original Macintosh operating system only allowed a selection of 8×8-pixel binary-image tiled patterns; the ability to use small color patterns was added in System 5 in 1987. Mac OS 8 in 1997 was the first Macintosh version to include built-in support for using arbitrary images as desktop pictures, rather than small repeating patterns.

Windows 3.0 in 1990 was the first version of Microsoft Windows to feature support for wallpaper customization, and used the term &quot;wallpaper&quot; for this feature. Although Windows 3.0 only came with 7 small patterns (2 black-and-white and 5 16-color), the user could supply other images in the BMP file format with up to 8-bit color (although the system was theoretically capable of handling 24-bit color images, it did so by dithering them to an 8-bit palette) to provide similar wallpaper features otherwise lacking in those systems. A wallpaper feature was added in a beta release of OS/2 2.0 in 1991.

Due to the widespread use of personal computers, some wallpapers have become immensely recognizable and gained iconic cultural status. &quot;Bliss&quot;, the default wallpaper of Windows XP, has become the most viewed photograph of the 2000s.
==Animated backgrounds==

Animated backgrounds (sometimes referred to as &quot;live backgrounds&quot; or &quot;dynamic backgrounds&quot;) refers to wallpapers which feature a moving image or a 2D / 3D scene as an operating system background rather than a static image, it may also refer to wallpapers being cycled in a playlist, often with certain transition effects. Some operating systems, such as Android, provide native support for animated wallpapers.

=== Microsoft Windows ===

* Active Desktop, which is included in Windows 95 OSR 2.5 through Windows XP, allows web apps to run as desktop background and deliver live contents. Animation is one of the possibilities.
* In the Ultimate edition of Windows Vista, Windows DreamScene allows videos of any supported format (including animated GIFs) as wallpapers.
* Starting with Windows 7, the OS can cycle through pictures from a folder at regular intervals. While the OS no longer supports animated backgrounds, it enables third-party software to fill that gap. This degree of extensibility is unique to Windows.

=== Android ===

Live wallpapers have been introduced in Android 2.0 Eclair to provide native support for animated wallpapers. From a technical point of view, live wallpapers are software applications that provide a moving background image and may allow for user interaction or utilize other hardware and software features within the device (accelerometer, GPS, network access, etc.).

=== macOS and iOS ===

macOS has built-in support, via the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver panel in its System Preferences/Settings, for cycling through a folder collection of images on a timed interval or when logging in or waking from sleep. Since macOS Mojave, the user can also select a &quot;Dynamic Desktop&quot; that automatically updates to visually match the time of the day.

Additionally, macOS has the native ability to run a screen saver on the desktop; in this configuration, the screen saver appears beneath the desktop icons in place of the system wallpaper. However, macOS does not feature a built-in interface to do this; it must be done through Terminal commands or various third-party applications.

Dynamically animated backgrounds have also been introduced in iOS 7 and later versions, however they are restricted to the ones provided by Apple. Jailbroken iOS devices can download other dynamic backgrounds.

=== Linux distros ===
Linux distributions usually provides their own original backgrounds. For example:

* Debian puts many alternative backgrounds under the codice_1 directory.
* GNOME 2 can be set to cycle through pictures from a folder at regular intervals, similarly to Windows 7.
* MATE provides various wallpapers, usually in the codice_2 directory.
* KDE version 4 and later provide various dynamic wallpapers, including a slideshow, and other options provided by plugins, such as fractals and Earth map.
* Enlightenment v17 supports image sequences, animated and interactive desktop backgrounds in its default configuration.

<text>Gundaharius or Gundahar (died 437), better known by his legendary names Gunther () or Gunnar (), was a historical King of the Burgundians in the early 5th century. Gundahar is attested as ruling his people shortly after they crossed the Rhine into Roman Gaul. He was involved in the campaigns of the failed Roman usurper Jovinus before the latter&#x27;s defeat, after which he was settled on the left bank of the Rhine as a Roman ally. In 436, Gundahar launched an attack from his kingdom on the Roman province of Belgica Prima. He was defeated by the Roman general Flavius Aetius, who destroyed Gundahar&#x27;s kingdom with the help of Hunnish mercenaries the following year, resulting in Gundahar&#x27;s death.

The historical Gundahar&#x27;s death became the basis for a tradition in Germanic heroic legend in which the legendary Gunther met his death at the court of Attila the Hun (Etzel/Atli). The character also became attached to other legends: most notably he is associated with Siegfried/Sigurd and Brunhild, and is implicated in Sigurd&#x27;s murder. He also appears as an adversary in the legend of Walter of Aquitaine. It is generally assumed that Gunther&#x27;s involvement in these other legends, in which he plays a secondary or antagonistic role, is a later development. Gunther&#x27;s importance in the story of the destruction of the Burgundians also waned with time.

Gunther appears as a legendary character in Latin, Middle High German, Old Norse, and Old English texts, as well as in various pictorial depictions from Scandinavia. Most significantly, he plays a role in the German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, the medieval Latin &quot;Waltharius&quot;, and the Old Norse &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. He also plays an important role in Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic Ring cycle, which is based on the medieval legends of Sigurd.

== Etymology ==
The first element of Gunther&#x27;s name is Proto-Germanic &quot;*gunþ-&quot;, meaning war or conflict. The second element is Proto-Germanic &quot;*-hari&quot;, meaning army.

The name of the historical Gundahar is attested in the primary sources as Latin &quot;Gundaharius&quot; or &quot;Gundicharius&quot; and Greek &quot;Γυντιάριος&quot; (&quot;Gyntiarios&quot;). Medieval Latin gives the name of the legendary figure as &quot;Guntharius&quot;, while Anglo-Saxon has &quot;Gūðhere&quot;, Old Norse has &quot;Gunnarr&quot;, and Middle High German has &quot;Gunther&quot;.

== Historical Gundahar ==
Gundahar is the first king of Burgundy to be historically attested. It is unclear if he ruled alone or if he may have ruled together with brothers, as occurs in the heroic tradition; the title &quot;φύλαρχος&quot; (&quot;phylarchos&quot;) given to him by Olympiodorus of Thebes may suggest he was not the sole ruler. In Prosper of Aquitaine he is identified as &quot;rex&quot; (king).

A majority of the Burgundians crossed the Rhine in 406/407, together with numerous other Germanic tribes. Their king Gundahar is first attested in 411 as cooperating with Goar, king of the Alans, to proclaim Jovinus as a new emperor in the province Germania Inferior on the lower Rhine. He is attested as being involved in Jovinus&#x27;s campaigns in southern Gaul. Following Jovinus&#x27;s defeat in 413, the Roman &quot;magister militum&quot; Constantius settled the Burgundians on the left bank of the Rhine as Roman &quot;foederati&quot;. Based on the later heroic tradition, many scholars identify their area of settlement as around Worms, though some scholars have argued in favor of other locations.

In the 430s, the Burgundians came under increasing pressure from the Huns; likely as a reaction to this Gundahar attacked the Roman province Belgica Prima (based around Trier) in 435. The Burgundians were defeated by the Roman general Flavius Aetius, who nevertheless confirmed Gundahar and his people&#x27;s rights to their kingdom. However, the next year (436) Aetius, accompanied by Hunnish mercenaries, attacked and destroyed the Burgundian kingdom. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, Gundahar and the majority of his people found their deaths in Aetius&#x27;s attack.

Aetius resettled the survivors of the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom in Savoy on the upper Rhone. The memory of Gundahar and his downfall was likely preserved by these survivors, as well as by observers from neighboring Germanic tribes.

The late fifth-/early-sixth century &quot;Lex Burgundionum&quot;, produced by the Burgundian king Gundobad at the Burgundians&#x27; new kingdom, mentions four older Burgundian kings: Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, and Gundahar. It makes no mention of any familial relationship between the kings, however. In the heroic tradition, Gibica (Gibeche/Gjúki) appears as Gundahar&#x27;s father, while Gundomar (Guthorm/Gernot) and Gislaharius (Giselher) appear as his brothers and co-kings.

== Anglo-Saxon traditions ==
=== &quot;Waldere&quot; ===
In the fragmentary Old English poem &quot;Waldere&quot; (c. 1000), the Old English attestation of the story of Walter of Aquitaine (see Waltharius under Continental traditions), Guðhere (Gunther) is preparing to attack Waldere (Walter). He refuses the gifts that Walther offers him to make peace and is portrayed as boastful. It appears that Guðhere wishes to take the gold that Waldere has with him.

=== &quot;Widsith&quot; ===
The narrator of the Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot; reports that he was given a ring by Guðhere when he visited the Burgundians (&quot;Burgendas&quot;).

== Continental traditions ==
=== &quot;Waltharius&quot; ===
The &quot;Waltharius&quot; is a Latin epic that reworks the legend of Walter of Aquitaine; it is conventionally dated to around 1000, but some scholars argue that it was produced in the Carolingian period.

In &quot;Waltharius&quot;, Gunther (as &quot;Guntharius&quot;) appears as a king of the Franks with his capital at Worms. At the beginning of the poem, Gunther&#x27;s father Gibeche (&quot;Gibico&quot;) has sent his vassal Hagen (&quot;Hageno&quot;) to the Huns as a hostage because Gunther is still too young. Hagen later flees back to Gibeche&#x27;s kingdom. When Walter and his love Hiltgunt flee the Huns, taking much treasure, they enter into Gunther&#x27;s kingdom by crossing the Rhine by Worms. They sell the ferryman fish they had brought with them in exchange for passage, and the ferryman brings these fish, which do not live in the area, to the king. Hagen tells Gunther that this must be Walter, and Gunther declares that now he can reclaim the gold that his father had paid to Attila in tribute. Although Hagen advises against it, the king sets out with some warriors to apprehend Walter and Hiltgunt. When Gunther finds the pair, he demands that Walter give him Hiltgunt and the gold. Walter refuses and kills Gunther&#x27;s warriors as they attack, despite Gunther&#x27;s encouragements. Finally, only Gunther and Hagen are left alive; they allow Walter to leave, then attack him from behind. Walter cuts off Gunther&#x27;s leg, but Hagen saves the king&#x27;s life when Walter wishes to kill him. After both Hagen and Walter have maimed each other, the fighting stops and Hiltgunt tends the warriors&#x27; wounds. The warriors then part in friendship.

The story presents a contrast to Gunther&#x27;s destruction in that he is attracted by the Huns&#x27; gold rather than the other way around. Like Gunther&#x27;s role in the death of Siegfried, his role in the legend of Walter places him in a negative light.

=== &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; ===
Gunther&#x27;s story next appears in writing in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; from c. 1200. In it, Gunther is the king of the Burgundians with a capital at Worms. He is the son of King Dancrat and Queen Ute and rules together with his royal brothers Giselher and Gernot, and his sister is named Kriemhild. When Siegfried comes to Worms to woo Kriemhild, he first challenges Gunther as king before the situation is resolved peacefully. Gunther subsequently relies on Siegfried to defeat his enemies the Saxons and Danes. Eventually, Gunther offers to allow Siegfried to marry Kriemhild if Siegfried first helps him woo the queen of Iceland, Brunhild. Brunhild has set various martial and physical challenges that any suitor must accomplish, or else she will kill him. Siegfried uses his cloak of invisibility (&quot;Tarnkappe&quot;) to allow Gunther to accomplish each challenge, and Brunhild is forced to marry Gunther. She refuses, however, to sleep with Gunther on her wedding night, tying him up and hanging him from a hook. Gunther again enlists Siegfried&#x27;s help, who takes Gunther&#x27;s shape and overpowers Brunhild so that Gunther can then sleep with her.

Some time later, Kriemhild and Brunhild quarrel, and Kriemhild tells Brunhild that Siegfried and not Gunther took her virginity. Brunhild complains to Gunther, who causes Siegfried to publicly swear that this is not true. Brunhild and Gunther&#x27;s vassal Hagen, however, are not satisfied, and convince Gunther to have Siegfried murdered while on a hunt. Hagen kills Siegfried, taking possession of his sword Balmung, and later arranges to steal the hoard of the Nibelungs that rightfully belongs to Kriemhild as Siegfried&#x27;s widow. After some time, Kriemhild is persuaded to be reconciled with Gunther, but not with Hagen. After she has been married to King Etzel (Attila) of the Huns, she invites her brothers to visit, plotting revenge. Gunther accepts this invitation despite Hagen&#x27;s warning, and the Burgundians trek from Worms to Etzelburg (Buda). Gunther can be said to play a secondary role to Hagen in the conclusion of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. When fighting begins, Gunther fights bravely. When only he and Hagen are left alive, Dietrich von Bern defeats and captures the two after his offers to surrender are rejected. Told by Hagen that he will only reveal the location of the hoard of the Nibelungs once Gunther is dead, Kriemhild has her brother beheaded.

=== &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; ===
Although the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot; (c. 1250) is written in Old Norse, the majority of the material is translated from German (particularly Low German) oral tales, as well as possibly some from German written sources such as the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Therefore, it is included here.

Gunnar (Gunther) is a king of the Niflungs who live in northern Germany at &quot;Niflungaland&quot;, with a capital at Verniza (Worms). He is the son of King Aldrian and Queen Oda and brother of Grimhild (Kriemhild), Gernoz (Gernot), and Gisler (Giselher), and half-brother of Högni (Hagen). In another version of the saga, his father is Irung.

Gunnar first appears when he takes part in the expedition of twelve heroes to Bertangenland organized by Thidrek (Dietrich von Bern). He loses in combat against one of King Isung&#x27;s sons, but is freed once Thidrek defeats Sigurd (Siegfried). Thidrek and Sigurd then accompany Gunnar back to his court, and Sigurd marries Gunnar&#x27;s sister Grimhild. Sigurd suggests that Gunnar should marry Brunhild, and Gunnar agrees. Although Brunhild is initially reluctant, saying Sigurd had promised to marry her, she eventually agrees. However, she refuses to sleep with Gunnar and overpowers him with her immense strength when he tries to. Gunnar then tells Sigurd to take Gunnar&#x27;s shape and deflower Brunhild for him. This takes away Brunhild&#x27;s strength; after this, Brunhild is brought back to Gunnar&#x27;s court.

After some time conflict erupts between Brunhild and Grimhild over their respective statuses at court. The quarrel causes Grimhild to reveal to Brunhild that Sigurd took her virginity, not Gunnar. When Gunnar hears of this, he and Högni decide to kill Sigurd. Högni then kills Sigurd on a hunt, and Gunnar and he place the corpse in Grimhild&#x27;s bed. Later, Grimhild is married to Atli (Attila), and she invites her brothers to visit her and her new husband&#x27;s court at Susat (Soest). She intends to kill them, while Atli desires the hoard they had taken from Sigurd. Gunnar agrees to come despite Högni&#x27;s warnings. As in the &quot;Nibeungenlied&quot;, Gunnar plays a secondary role to Högni in the action at Atli&#x27;s court. Once fighting breaks out at the Hunnish court, Gunnar is taken captive. Grimhild tells Atli to throw him into a tower full of snakes, where he dies.

The author of the saga has made a number of changes to create a more or less coherent story out of the many oral and possibly written sources that he used to create the saga. The author mentions alternative Scandinavian versions of many of these same tales, and appears to have changed some details to match the stories known by his Scandinavian audience. The saga&#x27;s version of the downfall of the Burgundians represents a unique mix of elements known from the Norse and continental traditions. Some elements that are closer to the Norse version may reflect genuine Low German traditions: a &quot;snake tower&quot; (&quot;Schlangenturm&quot;) is attested as having existed in Soest until the end of the eighteenth century.

== Scandinavian traditions and attestations ==
=== &quot;The Poetic Edda&quot; ===
The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, a collection of heroic and mythological Nordic poems, appears to have been compiled around 1270 in Iceland, and assembles mythological and heroic songs of various ages. As elsewhere in the Scandinavian tradition, Gunnar is the son of Gjuki and the brother of Gudrun and Högni. Depending on the poem Guthorm is either his full brother, step-brother, or half-brother. A sister Gullrönd also appears in one poem.

Generally, none of the poems in the collection is thought to be older than 900 and some appear to have been written in the thirteenth century. It is also possible that apparently old poems have been written in an archaicizing style and that apparently recent poems are reworkings of older material, so that reliable dating is impossible.

==== &quot;Grípisspá&quot; ====
In &quot;Grípisspá&quot;, a prophecy that Sigurd receives about his future life and deeds, Sigurd learns of his future marriage to Gudrun and his role taking Gunnar&#x27;s place in his wooing of Brunhild, followed by his murder.

The poem is probably not very old.

==== &quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot; ====
&quot;Brot af Sigurðarkviðu&quot; is only preserved fragmentarily: the surviving part of the poem tells the story of Sigurd&#x27;s murder. The fragment opens with Högni questioning Gunnar&#x27;s decision to have Sigurd murdered, believing that Brunhild&#x27;s claim that Sigurd slept with her might be false. Soon after the murder occurs, Gunnar shows himself to be deeply concerned about the future, while Brunhild admits that she lied to have Sigurd killed. Gunnar plays only a supporting role in the surviving portion of the poem, with Brunhild and Gudrun being the more important characters.

==== &quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; ====
&quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; retells the story of Sigurd&#x27;s life from his arrival at Gunnar&#x27;s court to his murder. On account of its content, which dwells on psychological motivation, and its style, this poem is generally not thought to be very old.

Sigurd and Gunnar become friends when Sigurd comes to Gunnar&#x27;s court, and Sigurd aids Gunnar in his wooing of Brunhild. Sigurd marries Gudrun, but Brunhild desires him for herself. In her jealousy, she threatens to leave Gunnar if he does not have Sigurd murdered. Gunnar and Högni decide that the death of Sigurd is not as bad as losing the queen, so they have their brother Guthorm murder him in his bed. Brunhild laughs loudly when she hears Gudrun&#x27;s wailing, and Gunnar insults her and makes accusations against her when he hears her laugh. Brunhild tells him that she never wanted to marry him, but was forced to by her brother Atli. She then kills herself in spite of Gunnar&#x27;s attempts to change her mind.

==== &quot;Dráp Niflunga&quot; ====
The &quot;Dráp Niflunga&quot; is a short prose section connecting the death of Sigurd to the following poems about the Burgundians (Niflungs) and Atli (Attila). Atli, who is Brunhild&#x27;s brother, blames Gunnar for Brunhild&#x27;s death, and in order to placate him Gunnar marries Gudrun to Atli. Gunnar desires to marry Brunhild and Atli&#x27;s sister Oddrun, but Atli refuses, so Gunnar and Oddrun become lovers. Some time later, Atli invites Gunnar and Högni to visit him, and they go despite a warning from Gudrun. Gunnar and Högni are taken prisoner, and Gunnar is thrown into a snake pit: he puts the snakes to sleep with his harp, but in the end one bites him in the liver, and he dies.

==== &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot; ====
In &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;, Atli&#x27;s sister Oddrun narrates the story of her love for Gunnar. She tells how Atli refused to marry her to Gunnar after her sister Brunhild&#x27;s death. She and Gunnar nevertheless begin an affair, sleeping together until one day they are discovered. In anger, Atli then murders Gunnar and Högni, throwing Gunnar into a snake pit. Oddrun says that she tries to help Gunnar escape the snake pit, but by the time she got there he was already dead, as her mother had turned into a snake and bitten him.

Oddrun appears to be a late addition to the legend, perhaps created so that the poet could &quot;tell the story of the fall of the Nibelungs from a different point of view.&quot; She also provides an additional reason for enmity between Gunnar and Atli besides Atli&#x27;s lust for treasure in Gunnar&#x27;s role as Oddrun&#x27;s lover.

==== &quot;Atlakviða&quot; ====
In &quot;Atlakviða&quot;, Atli invites Högni and Gunnar to his hall, claiming to wish to offer them great riches, but actually intending to kill them. Gunnar decides to come although Gudrun has sent them a warning. They cross through Myrkviðr (mirkwood) on their way to Atli&#x27;s court. Once they arrive, Atli captures Gunnar and Högni. He demands Gunnar&#x27;s hoard of gold, but Gunnar says he will not tell Atli until Högni is dead. Atli then kills Högni and brings his heart to Gunnar, who laughs and says now only he knows the secret of the hoard&#x27;s location. He refuses to tell Atli, so Atli has him thrown into a snake pit. Gunnar plays his harp there until he is bitten by a snake and dies.

&quot;Atlakviða&quot; is commonly supposed to be one of the oldest poems in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, possibly dating from the ninth century. The poem is particularly notable in that Sigurd is not mentioned at all. The presence of the forest Myrkviðr and the timelessness of the story show the poem to have moved into the realm of myth rather than historical legend. Alternatively, Myrkviðr could refer to the Ore Mountains, which are called &quot;Miriquidui&quot; by the historian Thietmar of Merseburg in the eleventh century.

==== &quot;Atlamál hin groenlenzku&quot; ====
&quot;Atlamál hin groenlenzku&quot; tells the same story as &quot;Atlakviða&quot; with several important differences. When Gunnar receives Atli&#x27;s invitation, he and Högni shrug off the warning sent by Gudrun. They then ignore the runes read by Högni&#x27;s wife Kostbera telling them not to go, and an ominous dream by Gunnar&#x27;s wife Glaumvör. When they arrive at Atli&#x27;s court, Atli&#x27;s messenger, who has accompanied them, announces that they must die. Gunnar and Högni kill him. Gudrun attempts to negotiate between the two sides but is unsuccessful; she fights with her brothers until they are captured. Atli then has Gunnar and Högni killed in order to spite Gudrun. Gunnar is thrown into a snake pit, where he plays the harp with his toes as his hands are bound. He is bitten and dies.

=== &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; ===
The &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; tells a longer prose version of Gunther&#x27;s life and deeds. It follows the plot given in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; fairly closely, although there is no indication that the author knew the other text. The author appears to have been working in Norway and to have known the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot; (c. 1250), a translation of continental Germanic traditions into Old Norse (see Þiðrekssaga above). Therefore the &quot;Völsunga Saga&quot; is dated to sometime in the second half of the thirteenth century.

Gunnar is portrayed as the son of Gjúki and Grimhild and brother of Högni, Gudrun, and Guthorm. After Sigurd&#x27;s arrival at the Burgundian court, Gunnar is encouraged by Grimhild to marry Brynhild. Brynhild, however, refuses to marry any man but the one who can ride through a wall of flame. Gunnar is unable to do this, and so Sigurd takes his shape and performs the action for him. Brynhild is thus forced to marry Gunnar. Some time later, Gudrun and Brynhild quarrel about whether Sigurd or Gunnar has the highest rank at the court. Gudrun then reveals the deception to Brynhild, who demands vengeance from Gunnar. He is unable to change her mind, and she demands that he kill Sigurd. Gunnar and Högni decide that their younger brother Guthorm, who has not sworn any oaths to Sigurd, should perform the murder. They feed him with wolf meat to make him more ferocious, then send him to kill Sigurd in his bed. After the murder, Brynhild commits suicide and prophesies Gunnar&#x27;s fate.

In order to be reconciled to Brynhild&#x27;s brother Atli for her death, Gunnar arranges for Sigurd&#x27;s widow, his sister Gudrun, to marry Atli. He also seeks to marry Atli&#x27;s other sister Oddrun, but Atli refuses and the two begin an affair. Gunnar instead marries the woman Glaumvör. After some time, desiring to avenge his sister and to gain Gunnar&#x27;s treasure, Atli invites Gunnar and Högni to his court, intending to kill them. Gunnar is suspicious and Gudrun has tried to warn them not to come, but once he and Högni are drunk, Atli&#x27;s messenger convinces them to accept the invitation. In spite of the warnings of their wives, Gunnar and Högni set out for Atli&#x27;s court. Once they arrive the messenger reveals that it is a trap, and they kill him. Atli demands the treasure that Gunnar took for Sigurd, and when Gunnar refuses, they begin to fight. Eventually, Gunnar and Högni are captured. Gunnar says he will not tell Atli where the hoard is unless he sees Högni&#x27;s heart. When he is finally shown the heart, Gunnar laughs and says that now only he knows where the hoard is and he will never tell. Atli then orders Gunnar thrown into a snake pit, where he plays the harp with his toes as his hands are bound. In the end, the snakes kill him.

=== Pictorial depictions ===

Gunnar&#x27;s death in the snake pit is well attested in pictorial depictions. Not all images of a man in a snake pit can be identified as Gunnar: the image appears to predate the story of Gunnar&#x27;s death. Although only images that also depict a harp can be securely identified as depicting Gunnar, Aðalheiður Guðmundsdóttir argues that the presence of a harp appears to have originally been a variant of the story of Gunnar&#x27;s death, and that images that do not depict a harp can therefore also depict Gunnar.

Only one potential depiction is located outside of Scandinavia, on the Isle of Man: the Kirk Andreas cross (c. 1000) shows a bound figure surrounded by snakes who has been identified as Gunnar. An alternative interpretation is that the figure is meant to represent Loki.

The earliest depiction that has been relatively securely identified as Gunnar is the picture stone Södermanland 40, from Västerljung, Sweden. Guðmundsdóttir argues that the presence of several Sigurd stones nearby make an identification of the bound figure on the stone with Gunnar very likely.

Gunnar can be securely identified on a number of church portals and baptismal fonts in Norway or areas formerly under Norwegian control in Sweden (see the Norum font), with the earliest dating to the twelfth-century and most dating to around 1200 or later. In all of these images, Gunnar is shown with a harp. The presence of Gunnar&#x27;s death in Christian religious contexts shows that a Christian interpretation was common: his death was seen as typologically related to the story of Daniel in the lions&#x27; den.

Seven additional images from Norway, Sweden, and the island of Gotland have been proposed to depict Gunnar in the snake pit, but without a harp: these images date from between the ninth and the eleventh centuries, and thus predate the secure attestations considerably. The earliest of these proposed identifications are the carvings on the cart found with the ninth-century Oseberg Ship burial. This identification is very controversial. Guðmundsdóttir suggests that the picture stone Klinte Hunninge I from Gotland (ninth/tenth century) may depict a version of the story of Oddrun&#x27;s aid to Gunnar, as it shows an unidentified female figure by the snake pit. She argues in favor of identifying the figure in the snake pit in all of these images with Gunnar, noting their apparent shared iconography. Guðmundsdóttir nevertheless dismisses a number of other proposed images of Gunnar, on the grounds that they are not clear.

== Wagnerian mythology ==
Here Gunther is ruler of the Gibichungs, son of Gibich and Grimhilde. Hagen is his half-brother, his father being the villainous dwarf Alberich. Hagen convinces Gunther and Gutrune to respectively wed Brunhilde and Siegfried, using a love potion on Siegfried to make him forget Brunhilde. After Hagen murders Siegfried, he and Gunther argue over the ring and Hagen kills Gunther.

<text>Theodore Crawford Cassidy (July 31, 1932 – January 16, 1979) was an American actor. He tended to play unusual characters in offbeat or science-fiction works, such as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and he played Lurch on &quot;The Addams Family&quot; TV series of the mid-1960s. He also narrated the intro sequence for the 1977 live-action &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; TV series and provided the growls &amp; roars for the Hulk for the series&#x27;s first 2 seasons before his untimely passing, with actor Charles Napier providing the title character&#x27;s vocals for the remainder of the series.

==Early life==
Cassidy was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Elwood Lewis Cassidy and Emily Cassidy (nee Crawford), of Irish ancestry, and raised in Philippi, West Virginia. In his youth, he was academically gifted and attended third grade at age six. During his freshman year of high school, at age 11, he was on the football and basketball teams.

After graduating from high school, Cassidy attended West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon, where he was a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. He transferred to Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, where he played college basketball for the Hatters and was active in the student government.

==Career==
Cassidy graduated from Stetson University with a BA degree. He began his broadcast career at WCOA in Pensacola during the summer of 1958 and through the fall of 1959. He then moved on to work as a DJ on WFAA in Dallas. He was an accomplished musician and moonlighted playing an organ for patrons of a Luby&#x27;s Cafeteria in Dallas&#x27; Lochwood Shopping Center. He &quot;was right in the middle of the excitement&quot; on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated and was among the first to interview eyewitnesses W. E. Newman Jr. and Gayle Newman.

===Television===

Cassidy&#x27;s height gave him an advantage in auditioning for unusual character roles. His best-known role is Lurch on &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, in which he feigned playing the harpsichord (although he was in fact an accomplished organist). With a separate contract he also played the character named Thing, though associate producer Jack Voglin took on the role in scenes involving both characters. Though the character of Lurch was originally intended to be mute, Cassidy&#x27;s ad-libbed &quot;You rang?&quot; in response to the butler call was an immediate hit. It became his signature line, and he was given more lines. Several episodes were written to feature Lurch.

Cassidy reprised the role of Lurch in later appearances. In the &quot;Batman&quot; episode &quot;The Penguin&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1966), he appears during the heroes&#x27; familiar climbing scene up the side of a building, as a tenant who is playing the &quot;Addams Family&quot; theme on a harpsichord prior to sticking his head out of the window and speaking to Batman and Robin. He voiced Lurch in an episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; (1972), and in the 1973 animated series adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. He again reprised Lurch in the TV film&quot; Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot; (1977).

According to Thomas &quot;Duke &quot; Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, Cassidy also had a small role opposite George Peppard in one episode of the TV movie series &quot;Banacek&quot;. Cassidy played a worker in an auto scrapyard who attempted to kill Banacek because the investigator traced him as part of the plot to steal a rare and valuable book. In addition to &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Cassidy found steady work in a variety of other television shows. He had a prominent role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; as Injun Joe, the enemy of Tom Sawyer and Huck. In the 1967 &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Napoleon&#x27;s Tomb Affair&quot;, Cassidy played a henchman, Edgar, who kidnaps, tortures, and repeatedly tries to kill Napoleon and Illya.

Cassidy also provided the voices of the more aggressive version of Balok in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; and the Gorn in the episode &quot;Arena&quot;, and played the part of the android Ruk in the episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;. Cassidy did more work with &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry in the early 1970s, playing Isaiah in the postapocalyptic drama pilots &quot;Genesis II&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot;. In the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; episode &quot;The Thief from Outer Space&quot;, he played the Slave to the alien Thief (Malachi Throne), who threatens the Robinsons.

In &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; episode &quot;The Dahlia Feud&quot; from 1967, he played Mr. Ted, a large, muscular gardener who plants dahlias for Mrs. Drysdale. In 1968, Cassidy appeared on &quot;Mannix&quot; in the episode &quot;To Kill a Writer&quot; as Felipe Montoya, on &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; in &quot;The Scrimshaw Ivory Chart&quot; as a pirate named Gentle Sam, and in two episodes of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; as the master of Jeannie&#x27;s devious sister in the episode &quot;Genie, Genie, Who&#x27;s Got the Genie?&quot;, and Jeannie&#x27;s cousin in the episode &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Feed the Astronauts&quot;.

In the two-part &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; episode &quot;The Return of Bigfoot&quot; (1976), Cassidy provided the body and vocal effects of Bigfoot (the role was originally played by professional wrestler André the Giant in a previous two-parter). Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode &quot;Bigfoot V&quot;.

Cassidy also starred in &quot;Bonanza&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Decision in Los Robles&quot; in 1970.

===Other film and TV work===
Concurrent with his appearances on &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the Hanna-Barbera Studios, culminating in the role of Frankenstein Jr., in &quot;Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles&quot; series, and even reprising Lurch on several occasions for Hanna-Barbera productions (most notably for the &quot;Addams Family&quot; animated series in 1973–74). He was the voice of &quot;Meteor Man&quot; in &quot;Birdman and the Galaxy Trio&quot;, as well as the hero in the Chuck Menville pixillated short film &quot;Blaze Glory&quot;, in which his already-deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound. Cassidy also voiced Ben Grimm (&quot;The Thing&quot;) in &quot;The New Fantastic Four&quot;. Cassidy went on to perform the roars and growls for Godzilla in the 1979 cartoon series that Hanna-Barbera co-produced with Toho, and was also the voice of Montaro in the &quot;Jana of the Jungle&quot; segments that accompanied &quot;Godzilla&quot; during its first network run. His voice was the basis for the sinister voice of Black Manta, as well as Brainiac and several others on &quot;Super Friends&quot;. Cassidy was the original voice of Moltar and Metallus on &quot;Space Ghost&quot; from 1966 to 1968. Cassidy&#x27;s final role was as King Thun of the Lion Men in the television animated feature film &quot;Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All&quot;. That particular role was originally recorded shortly before Cassidy&#x27;s death in 1979, until the decision was made to use the footage for a television series, &quot;The New Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;. As such, Cassidy&#x27;s death necessitated his role being recast for the series with Allan Melvin. After the series&#x27; conclusion, the original feature film and soundtrack were reassembled using Cassidy&#x27;s performance and broadcast in prime time in 1982. In live-action productions for the TV series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, he provided narration of the title sequence, and the Hulk&#x27;s growls and roars. In deleted scenes from the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; TV pilot movie, &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot;, Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the Cylon Imperious Leader, before actor Patrick Macnee was contracted to voice the character.

Other film work includes &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969), &quot;The Limit&quot; (1972), &quot;Banacek&quot; (1972),&quot;Charcoal Black&quot; (1972), &quot;The Slams&quot; (1973), &quot;Thunder County&quot; (1974), &quot;Poor Pretty Eddie&quot; (1975), &quot;Harry and Walter Go to New York&quot; (1976), &quot;The Last Remake of Beau Geste&quot; (1977) and &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot; (1978). Alongside Michael Werner, he co-wrote the screenplay of 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Harrad Experiment&quot;, in which he made a brief appearance. During that time, he also worked with Noel Marshall, the executive producer of &quot;Harrad Experiment&quot;, on the adventure-comedy film &quot;Roar&quot; (released two years after his death).

In 1965, he released a single on Capitol Records with &quot;The Lurch&quot;, written by Gary S. Paxton, and &quot;Wesley&quot;, written by Cliffie Stone and Scott Turner. He introduced the dance and performed the song &quot;The Lurch&quot; on September 11, 1965, on &quot;Shivaree!&quot; and performed it again on Halloween of the same year on &quot;Shindig!&quot;

==Height==
Contrary to urban legend, Ted Cassidy did not suffer from acromegaly, an endocrine disorder in which there is an overproduction of growth hormone from the pituitary gland that causes excessive bone growth in certain parts of the body. This has been debunked by his son, Sean Cassidy, on the &quot;Son of Lurch&quot; interview on Youtube. Ted Cassidy was just tall (he was 6 foot 8 inches tall), as is his son, Sean, who is 6 foot 7 inches tall.

==Death==
Cassidy underwent surgery at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles to have a benign tumor removed from his heart. Complications arose several days later while he was recuperating at home. He was readmitted to the same hospital, where he died on January 16, 1979, at the age of 46. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in the backyard of his home in Woodland Hills.

<text>The Colorado River dispute is a long-running dispute between the United States and Mexico over water rights to the Colorado River.

==Background== 
In 1884, the International Boundary and Water Commission was founded between Mexico and the United States as an entity to, among other things, oversee the flow of water from the United States to Mexico. The IBaWC negotiated the 1944 United States-Mexico Treaty for Utilization of Water of the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana rivers and allotted to Mexico a guaranteed annual quantity of water from these sources. However the treaty did not define the quality of the water. This became a problem with rapid development in the southern United States in the late 1950s, when the United States began diverting significant amounts of water from the Colorado River for the newly developed areas. Mexico protested and entered into negotiations with the United States. In 1974 an international agreement resulted in interpreting the 1944 treaty as guaranteeing Mexico the same quality of water as that being used in the United States.

==Legislation==
*1922- The Colorado River Compact was signed by the seven states part of the Colorado River Basin. Its goal was to allocate the water in two parts, an Upper Division and Lower Division. The Compact was amended in 2007 to preserve the water in the event of shortages.
*1973 - The Endangered Species Act was passed to protect endangered species.
* 1974 - The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act was passed to deal with salinity and water quality.
* 1992 - The Grand Canyon Protection Act was passed to recognize the recreational value of the Colorado River to Grand Canyon National Park.

==California water agencies agreement 2003==
In 2003, the water agencies of Southern California agreed to Quantification Settlement Agreement which would move millions of gallons from the river, which was originally used by desert farmers and divert it towards the fast-growing city of San Diego.

==Plans to end the river dispute 2003==
In 2003, four Southern California water agencies, that had failed to reach a key Colorado River water-sharing pact, were studying a proposal that addressed the deal&#x27;s main stumbling blocks. Government aides, including Gray Davis, proposed that the state Department of Water Resources explore a billion-dollar plan to shrink the size of the Salton Sea and restore it to health. If the plan was feasible, farm runoff, that would otherwise have flowed into the sea, could be desalinated and sent to San Diego County. He also proposed that farmers would pay a $1 surcharge for every acre-foot of Colorado River water they use over the next 35 years. Urban users, who use less river water, would pay a $3 fee per acre-foot. The millions generated would cover the cost of new wetland habitats as well as air quality and Salton Sea mitigation associated with the water transfer to San Diego.

<text>The Marine Air Terminal (also known as Terminal A) is an airport terminal at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York City, United States. Its main building, designed in the Art Deco style by William Delano of the firm Delano &amp; Aldrich, opened in 1940. The terminal was built to handle Pan Am&#x27;s fleet of flying boats, the Boeing 314 Clippers, which landed on the nearby Bowery Bay. Technological advances after World War II made the Clippers obsolete, and the Marine Air Terminal was renovated in 1946 to serve conventional planes. the terminal is used by Spirit Airlines for flights to various destinations around the U.S.

The Marine Air Terminal was LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s original terminal for overseas flights. It was highly popular in the 1940s, when LaGuardia was the only major airport in the U.S. which offered regular flights to Europe. Traffic dropped drastically after the larger Idlewild Airport opened in 1948, and Clippers stopped serving the terminal in 1952. The terminal then served as the airport&#x27;s general aviation terminal for more than three decades, except for a short period in the 1950s, when it was used by Northeast Airlines. The Pan Am Shuttle service started operating from Marine Air Terminal in 1986. Delta Air Lines took over the service in 1991, operating Delta Shuttle flights from the terminal until 2017, after which it was used by various carriers. The terminal has been renovated multiple times throughout its history.

The main terminal building consists of a two-story circular core with a projecting entrance pavilion and a pair of two-story wings. The brick facade is painted buff, with black details, and contains a frieze that depicts flying fish. The three-story rectangular entrance pavilion contains a canopy and a set of doors leading to the terminal&#x27;s main rotunda. The rotunda contains marble floors and walls, as well as the &quot;Flight&quot; mural by James Brooks. Both the interior and the exterior of the main building were designated as New York City landmarks in 1980, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In addition, there was a hangar for seaplanes next to the main building, which has been converted into a garage for snow-removal vehicles.

==History==
Following Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s transatlantic flight in 1927, commercial air travel in the United States increased during the 1930s. New York City was in dire need of a new airport by 1934, after Fiorello H. La Guardia was elected mayor. Angered that a flight on which he was a passenger landed in Newark, New Jersey, even though his ticket said &quot;New York&quot;, LaGuardia pushed New Yorkers to support the construction of an airport in New York City itself. The city did have a public airport, Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, but it was further from Midtown Manhattan than Newark Airport was. After commencing several studies on the feasibility of a new airport in New York City, the La Guardia administration decided to redevelop the existing North Beach Airport in Queens. The city government leased North Beach Airport in 1934.

=== Development ===
La Guardia&#x27;s administration presented plans for a renovation of North Beach Airport (now LaGuardia Airport) in August 1937. The plans included a terminal for seaplanes along Bowery Bay, on the western side of the airport, as well as a terminal for land planes along Flushing Bay, on the eastern side. The seaplane terminal, to be known as the Marine Air Terminal, was to contain four hangars, an administrative building, and a machine shop. The administrative building was to be a circular brick-and-steel edifice measuring tall and about across. A baggage check, customs and immigration offices, an air traffic control tower, and various other offices would be centered around a main waiting room, and there would be access ramps for seaplane passengers. The seaplane and land-plane terminals, both designed by the firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich, would operate independently of each other. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) would provide federal funding for the project.

U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt approved plans for the airport on September 3, 1937, and La Guardia participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the airport six days later. The airport was originally projected to cost $15 million and be completed in time for the opening of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. By July 1938, the WPA employed 7,800 workers on the project, and workers were expanding the airport site through land reclamation. The number of workers had increased to 11,500 by that November, and the cost had increased to $29 million. Prior to the opening of the seaplane terminal, in early 1939, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that flying boats from England, France, Germany, and the United States would be using the terminal. The terminal had been planned with two seaplane hangars, but only one hangar was built at the time; that hangar was nearly complete by April 1939.

The expanded North Beach Airport opened on October 15, 1939, and was officially renamed the New York Municipal Airport–LaGuardia Field later that year. Covering with nearly of runways, the airport cost $40 million, making it the largest and most expensive in the world at that time. The seaplane terminal comprised $7.5 million of this cost, and the hangar alone cost $2 million. The land-plane section of the airport opened for commercial flights on December 2, 1939, but the completion of the marine terminal was delayed until March 1940. This was in part because construction in Bowery Bay had prevented seaplanes from landing there. Seaplanes instead traveled to bases in Port Washington, New York, and in Baltimore, Maryland.

=== Pan Am use ===
At a hearing before the Civil Aeronautics Board in April 1939, Pan American Airways indicated that it planned to use North Beach Airport as the main U.S. terminal for the transatlantic flights of its Boeing 314 Clippers. Under this plan, Clippers would fly to Baltimore if there was bad weather in New York City. Pan Am leased the Marine Air Terminal from the New York City government the following month. Pan Am also allowed foreign airlines to use the terminal, including Imperial Airways, Air France, and KLM.

==== Opening and early years ====
The Marine Air Terminal officially opened on March 31, 1940, when a Clipper carrying ten crew members, nine passengers, and over 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) of mail departed from the terminal. This flight landed in Lisbon, Portugal, 18 hours and 35 minutes later, setting a record for an eastbound transatlantic Clipper flight. The first flying boat to arrive at the Marine Air Terminal arrived from Bermuda on April 1, 1940. At the time, the terminal served three transatlantic trips per week. A brochure distributed on the terminal&#x27;s opening day proclaimed it as &quot;an enduring terminal linking the air routes of the old world with those of the new&quot;. Originally, members of the public were allowed to visit the Marine Air Terminal&#x27;s observation deck, which became a popular place to observe seaplane and airplane landings. The deck was closed for security reasons during World War II.

In July 1940, American Export Airlines and city officials began discussing the possibility of constructing a second seaplane hangar next to the Marine Air Terminal. American Export wanted to operate a transatlantic passenger route from LaGuardia Airport, but Pan Am did not have any more space in its existing hangar. The New York City Planning Commission approved the proposed hangar in April 1941, allocating $389,000 to the project. LaGuardia attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the second hangar on August 4, 1941, and work on the hangar began that December. James Brooks completed his &quot;Flight&quot; mural inside the main terminal building in September 1942. The following year, in April 1943, an expansion to the original Pan Am hangar was completed. By then, the Marine Air Terminal had more than one transatlantic trip per day. American Export&#x27;s new hangar opened in July 1943, and the terminal&#x27;s observation deck reopened in June 1945.

A &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; article in 1942 noted that Clipper flights came from as far as &quot;Capetown, Lisbon, New Zealand, the Orient, Alaska and other remote places&quot;. During the Second World War, many soldiers would fly to Europe and Africa from the terminal, and political figures such as U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and British prime minister Winston Churchill also flew from the terminal. Even so, the Marine Air Terminal lasted as a seaplane terminal for less than a decade. When the terminal opened, seaplanes were generally more technologically advanced than traditional land planes; the earliest four-engine aircraft, capable of flying long distances, had been seaplanes. However, they were also more prone to disruption, particularly during the winter months and in poor tidal conditions, when they could not operate. Land planes were not affected by these issues, and land-plane technology was also improving quickly. With the outbreak of World War II, new four-engine land planes were being developed, making these seaplanes obsolete. Pan Am stopped operating the 314s into the terminal in June 1945 but continued to operate other service into the terminal.

==== Use as international terminal ====
By the mid-1940s, the small capacity of LaGuardia Airport could not handle the increasing demand for international flights. Despite the obsolescence of seaplanes, LaGuardia Airport was the only major airport in the U.S. which offered regular flights to Europe. To address increasing congestion at the Marine Air Terminal, the city government and representatives of several airlines agreed in June 1946 to spend $50,000 on upgrading the customs facilities at the terminal. Although the terminal had begun to serve land planes, it could only fit one plane at a time, and passengers frequently had to wait three to four hours before passing through customs. The &quot;Daily Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the rotunda often saw as much traffic as a subway station during rush hours, with up to ten overseas flights trying to land nearly simultaneously at the busiest times. The Marine Air Terminal served 14 airlines; the overcrowded conditions had prompted one airline owner to purchase an old ferryboat and moor it next to the Marine Air Terminal.

The improvements included the addition of a covered walkway, three gates for arriving passengers, and two gates for departing passengers. After the terminal reopened on November 7, 1946, it was renamed the International Air Terminal, serving all of LaGuardia&#x27;s transatlantic flights. Meanwhile, Idlewild (now JFK) Airport was being built in southern Queens to accommodate international and transcontinental flights. The Port of New York Authority took over operation of LaGuardia and Idlewild airports in June 1947. That September, Port Authority officials suggested extending one of LaGuardia&#x27;s runways by infilling an unused plot of land next to the International Air Terminal. The terminal served 314,000 passengers a year in 1948, many more than it had been built to accommodate.

Air traffic at the terminal started to decline after Idlewild opened in 1948. The terminal was renamed the Overseas Terminal in August 1949 because passengers frequently confused it with Idlewild, which was formally known as New York International Airport. In the years after Idlewild opened, most transatlantic flights at the Overseas Terminal were moved over to Idlewild. The terminal had become empty most of the time, and Pan Am, American Overseas Airlines, and Trans World Airlines were the only airlines still operating international flights from the terminal. Pan Am relocated most of its operations from the terminal in early 1951, and the last transatlantic flight from the Overseas Terminal departed on April 28, 1951. Afterward, only flights to Bermuda continued to operate out of Marine Air Terminal. These flights lasted for less than a year, and service from the Overseas Terminal ceased in February 1952. Around that time, the &quot;Flight&quot; mural in the terminal was painted over for reasons unknown even to James Brooks, the mural&#x27;s own artist. Brooks did not learn that the mural had been painted over until after the fact.

=== 1950s to 1970s ===

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the terminal was &quot;quickly forgotten&quot; after Clipper service stopped. The terminal was used mostly by private planes, non-scheduled flights, and military transports for high-ranking government officials. U.S. presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy sometimes used the terminal when they landed at LaGuardia Airport. The terminal also contained the offices of flight simulation company FlightSafety, founded in 1951 by Albert Lee Ueltschi. The Port Authority announced its plans to renovate most of LaGuardia Airport in 1957, but Marine Air Terminal was excluded from these plans.

The terminal reopened for commercial aviation on June 27, 1957, when Northeast Airlines leased the terminal for its shuttle services between New York and Boston. Private, non-scheduled, and military flights continued to use the terminal. That October, Northeast relocated Boston flights to LaGuardia&#x27;s domestic terminal and started using the Marine Air Terminal for its flights to Florida. The swap took place because Gate 11 at the domestic terminal was too small for the four-engine DC-6Bs that were used on the Florida flights. Pan Am moved some of its remaining equipment from the Marine Air Terminal to Idlewild in 1958. By then, the Marine Air Terminal was no longer an important part of LaGuardia&#x27;s operation; only five percent of the airport&#x27;s 5.4 million passengers in 1959 came through the terminal. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the terminal in 1960 as having &quot;an air of decay and desolation&quot;, with a dirty skylight, broken equipment, peeling paint, and almost no passengers.

In 1964, American Hydrofoils agreed to operate a shuttle hydrofoil service from the Marine Air Terminal to East 25th Street and Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan. After the Federal Aviation Administration banned non-scheduled airlines from operating regular flights and selling tickets in the 1960s, the Marine Air Terminal sat nearly empty for several years. The Butler Aviation Company, which managed LaGuardia&#x27;s general aviation operations, had divided the walkway adjoining the terminal into a waiting room and an office, and there was a pilots&#x27; lounge next to the walkway. Butler leased the terminal and spent $200,000 to renovate the eastern portion of the main building. Following the renovation, the Marine Air Terminal reopened in October 1966 as a general aviation terminal. At the time, there were 400 daily general aviation flights at LaGuardia, about half of the airport&#x27;s daily air traffic. The terminal was then known as Butler Marine Air Terminal. The main building&#x27;s rotunda was repainted in the 1960s and was again supposed to be repainted in the 1970s.

Aviation historian Geoffrey Arend advocated for the restoration of the &quot;Flight&quot; mural in the main building&#x27;s rotunda starting in 1976. A reporter for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote in 1979 that some of the main building&#x27;s original Art Deco details remained, mainly on the exterior. That February, philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller and magazine publisher DeWitt Wallace agreed to partially fund the restoration of the &quot;Flight&quot; mural, which was projected to cost $75,000. Alan M. Farancz restored the mural, and it was rededicated on September 19, 1980. During that time, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered protecting the terminal as an official New York City landmark Arend supported the designation, but the Port Authority expressed opposition because such a designation would severely restrict what the agency could do with the terminal. The LPC designated the main building&#x27;s facade and a portion of its interior as landmarks in late 1980, citing it as &quot;the only active terminal in the United States dating from the first generation of passenger air travel&quot;. The main building was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1982.

===Shuttle use===

==== Pan Am Shuttle ====
Pan Am announced its Pan Am Shuttle service from New York to Boston and Washington in 1986, having purchased the rights to New York Air&#x27;s shuttle service. The airline initially planned to operate from two gates at the main terminal, but these gates were too small to fit the Boeing 727 and Airbus A300 fleet on the route, so Pan Am built new gates at the Marine Air Terminal. Construction of these gates began at the end of August 1986. Pan Am spent $23 million to build a prefabricated structure next to the main building. The structure was completed in 41 days, as Pan Am was contractually obligated to begin shuttle flights by October 1986. Local politicians and preservationists were irate at the changes. Days before the renovations were to be completed, several politicians attempted to halt the project, claiming that the Port Authority had illegally modified the portion of the terminal that had been designated as a landmark. Port Authority executives said they were only renovating a portion of the building that was not protected by the landmark designation. Rocco Manniello, who operated a small Italian restaurant at the rear of the main building, renovated his restaurant during this time.

Pan Am Shuttle flights started operating from the Marine Air Terminal on October 1, 1986. The terminal was relatively remote, being about from the other buildings at LaGuardia Airport. Taxicabs had to take a circuitous route to access the terminal, and taxi drivers were hesitant to pick up passengers at the terminal, prompting Pan Am to sponsor giveaways for taxi drivers who drove there. As a result, the shuttle was initially unable to compete with Eastern Air Lines, which carried the majority of passengers who flew between New York and Boston. To attract passengers, Pan Am started operating a ferry line between Wall Street and the terminal in August 1987 and added an intermediate stop at the East 34th Street Ferry Landing to the route in July 1988. This improved ridership to the point that Pan Am Shuttle was one of the airline&#x27;s only profitable routes. Pan Am also opened a club for business flyers within the terminal. Nonetheless, by 1990, Pan Am sought to sell the shuttle.

==== Delta Shuttle ====
Delta Air Lines acquired the Pan Am Shuttle from Pan Am in 1991 and started operating the Delta Shuttle from the Marine Air Terminal using Boeing 727-200s. Delta also inherited the ferry route to Manhattan, which was unprofitable despite receiving large subsidies from Delta. By 1995, the Port Authority was considering restoring the facade and interior of the terminal&#x27;s main building. Architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle was hired to restore the terminal building to its original design, including light fixtures, canopies, and signage, at a cost of $600,000. A bust of Fiorello La Guardia was relocated from the airport&#x27;s main terminal to the Marine Air Terminal in 1997. Harbor Shuttle, which operated ferry service from the Marine Air Terminal to Manhattan, was sold in 1998 to NY Waterway, which discontinued the service in 2000. The Port Authority unsuccessfully attempted to revive the ferry service in subsequent years.

Delta started renovating the terminal in early 1998 at a cost of $7.5 million. The Marine Air Terminal formally reopened in November 1999 with a new business center and concession stands. At the time, 80 percent of passengers at the terminal were business travelers, and about 6,000 of the airport&#x27;s 65,000 daily passengers used the terminal. Following this renovation, most passengers were diverted past the main terminal building. The Port Authority spent about $6.5 million to restore the terminal in 2004, ahead of the 65th anniversary of the airport&#x27;s first commercial flight. As part of the project, all of the tiles in the main building&#x27;s frieze were removed for restoration. LaGuardia&#x27;s general manager at the time called it the &quot;crown jewel of the airport&quot;. Delta added a business center to the terminal in 2006. The Port Authority voted to install vehicular bollards in front of the terminal in 2007 due to security concerns following the September 11 attacks.

In 2009, it was announced as part of a slot-swap transaction that Delta Air Lines would relocate to LaGuardia&#x27;s Central Terminal, while US Airways would start operating its US Airways Shuttle out of the Marine Air Terminal. The swap would have allowed Delta to operate hourly flights between LaGuardia and O&#x27;Hare International Airport. The proposed swap between US Airways and Delta never took place. Delta Shuttle continued to operate from the Marine Air Terminal until December 8, 2017. Meanwhile, in 2010, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission introduced a pilot program that allowed Delta Shuttle passengers to share a taxicab between the Marine Air Terminal and Manhattan, but this program was unpopular.

==== LaGuardia redevelopment ====

In 2015, New York governor Andrew Cuomo and vice president Joe Biden announced a $4 billion plan to rebuild most of LaGuardia&#x27;s terminals as one contiguous building. The Marine Air Terminal was preserved as part of the plan because it was an official landmark. On December 9, 2017, as part of the LaGuardia redevelopment, Delta Air Lines ceased shuttle operations out of the Marine Air Terminal, moving back to Terminal C. Alaska Airlines and JetBlue relocated their operations from Terminal B to the Marine Air Terminal. Alaska Airlines ended all service from LaGuardia Airport on October 27, 2018. JetBlue used the Marine Air Terminal for flights to Boston, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. The airline renovated the terminal as part of a project completed in early 2019.

On April 28, 2021, Spirit Airlines started service from the Marine Air Terminal for its flights to Fort Lauderdale, although the airline&#x27;s other destinations were still located in Terminal C. Spirit moved its remaining LaGuardia services to the Marine Air Terminal the following March. JetBlue moved all operations to Terminal B on July 9, 2022, after having previously split its operations between Terminal B and the Marine Air Terminal. In mid-2023, JetBlue announced that, if its merger with Spirit was permitted to go through, it would sell Spirit&#x27;s six gates and 22 landing slots at the Marine Air Terminal to Frontier Group Holdings during 2024. The JetBlue–Spirit merger did not go through. Frontier Airlines relocated to Terminal B in April 2024, leaving Spirit as the only airline at the Marine Air Terminal.

== Main building ==
The Marine Air Terminal, also known as Terminal A, is at the western end of LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York City, along the southern shore of Bowery Bay. The terminal was designed in the Art Deco style by William Delano of the firm Delano &amp; Aldrich. It is LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s only remaining structure from the 1940s; the other buildings from that era had also been designed in the Art Deco style.

Landside access to the main terminal building is via Marine Terminal Road, which ends at a turnaround directly in front of the building. This turnaround is served by the buses, as well as the LaGuardia Airport shuttle bus. Originally, the terminal was accessed by 85th Street, a boulevard planted with hedges. Parking lot P10 is located next to the terminal.

=== Exterior ===

The terminal&#x27;s main building is a circular two-story structure flanked by a pair of one-story wings facing northwest and northeast toward Bowery Bay. The main building is approached by a triple-height rectangular pavilion facing south. The entrance pavilion and the rear wings were all intended as access points into the central core, which housed the primary functions of the terminal. The brick facade was originally painted buff with black details but, by the 1980s, had been repainted beige with brown details. The buff and black color scheme has since been restored. A horizontal band runs across the facade between the first and second stories. The terminal&#x27;s windows are largely oriented horizontally, rather than vertically as in other Art Deco structures; this may be attributed to the fact that the terminal was completed later than other Art Deco buildings and is also relatively short.

The circular core measures across. It contains a setback above the ground story, which makes it appear as though it is designed in a wedding-cake style. There are dark brick window frames on the ground and second stories, which surround groups of tripartite windows. Faceted brick panels are placed between each group of windows, and there were originally grilles over the windows themselves. A cornice of stainless steel, as well as a parapet and a rooftop balcony, run above the ground story. The rooftop balcony originally contained two observation decks. In addition, the second story is topped by a terracotta frieze, which depicts yellow flying fish against a background of light and dark blue waves. The frieze contains 2,200 individual tiles. A similar motif was also used on several of Delano and Aldrich&#x27;s other structures. There is an attic with a facade of stainless steel panels, as well as a control tower at the rear of the attic.
The three-story rectangular entrance pavilion is flanked by two shorter sections. The entrance, at the center of this pavilion, consists of a doorway with four stainless steel doors, which are topped by transom panels depicting a pair of winged globes. A curving stainless-steel canopy extends in front of these doors, and a double-height window is placed above the canopy. The double-height window and the doorway are the same width and are both surrounded by a band of dark bricks. Steel mullions divide the window into a grid measuring four panes across and five panes high. The shorter sections of the pavilion contain small windows at ground level. The terracotta frieze around the circular core also runs atop the shorter sections of the entrance.

The rear wings measure across. They are similar in design to the circular core. Passengers boarded seaplanes from the northwest wing and arrived through the northeast wing. There was a copper canopy above the walkway leading to the northeast wing. A corridor, flanked by waiting rooms, extended from the northeast wing to a landing float in Bowery Bay. Originally, flying boats and other seaplanes typically taxied to the landing float, where they were pulled by a small motor boat to allow passengers to disembark into the terminal. Marine aircraft could approach the terminal via six operating channels in the bay, each measuring . The modern Terminal A leads to gates A1 through A6.

=== Interior ===
The four stainless-steel doors at the main entrance pavilion lead to a foyer with four doors of identical design, topped by transom panels depicting winged globes. Past the foyer are staircases with stainless-steel railings, as well as another set of five stainless-steel doors. These lead into a two-story rotunda with a skylight at the third story. The staircase around the rotunda could be seen from outside.

The rotunda contains light-gray marble floors with a circular geometric pattern at the center of the floor. The rotunda contains wooden benches, the ends of which contain stainless-steel arms that depict propeller blades. The lower section of the wall is made of dark-green marble. This wall is divided into 14 bays, which contain ticketing offices, stores, and other functions. These bays are arranged into groups of four or five, with each group being separated by the doors to the west, east, and south. A band of stainless steel runs above the wall at the ground story, separating it from the &quot;Flight&quot; mural on the upper section of the wall. The rotunda&#x27;s ceiling steps upward from the perimeter of the room to the skylight at the center.

On the second story, surrounding the rotunda, were various offices for the terminal&#x27;s staff, including radio technicians, communications workers, and meteorologists. In addition, there were turnstiles on the second and third stories for members of the public who wanted to observe the Clippers. The main building&#x27;s control tower contained radio equipment for monitoring seaplane landings and takeoffs in Bowery Bay.

==== Mural ====

Inside the rotunda hangs &quot;Flight,&quot; a mural measuring tall and long. Completed by James Brooks in 1942, &quot;Flight&quot; depicts the history of man&#x27;s involvement with flight. It was the largest mural created as part of the Great Depression-era Works Progress Administration (WPA). The mural is roughly divided into two sections. The first section depicts early history of aviation, including prehistoric humans&#x27; inability to fly; the Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun and got burned; and the flight-related inventions of Leonardo da Vinci. The second section depicts the modern history of aviation, starting with the Wright brothers&#x27; test flights and ending with modern transatlantic flights. The mural hangs on the upper section of the wall, just below the ceiling.

&quot;Flight&quot; was completely painted over in 1952. It is unknown why this was done; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said it may have been due to anti-communist sentiment, but LaGuardia operations chief Anthony Cycovek said the rotunda had begun to look dingy when the mural was painted over. The mural was only rediscovered in 1973, after Cycovek mentioned it to a Port of New York Authority executive who had heard of the National Fine Arts Inventory Project, a program dedicated to finding lost works of government-commissioned art. In the late 1970s, Geoffrey Arend, an aviation historian and author of &quot;Great Airports: LaGuardia&quot;, mounted a campaign to restore the mural to its original splendor. The mural was rededicated on September 18, 1980. Grace Glueck of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the most egregious case of mural censorship&quot; of a WPA mural in New York City. By 2022, &quot;Flight&quot; had been restored again as part of the LaGuardia redevelopment.

== Seaplane hangar ==
When LaGuardia Airport was built in the 1930s, two seaplane hangars adjacent to the main building were planned. Initially, only one hangar was built. The hangar had five sides and resembled a half-octagon from above. The north and south sides of the hangar each measured wide; the northwest and southwest sides were each wide; and the west side was wide. The hangar had four openings through which seaplanes and flying boats could enter. These openings measured high. In addition, the roof of the hangar measured high and was held up by trusses extending from a central pillar. A tunnel connected the hangar to the main building.

Next to the hangar were ramps with floodlights, as well as taxiways illuminated by lamps. There were also 18 large gasoline tanks next to the hangar, each with a capacity of . Whenever the Clippers needed maintenance, they could be pulled out of the water, moved onto a set of tracks, and towed to the hangar. The tracks were made of concrete and could accommodate aircraft weighing up to , or about five times as heavy as an empty Boeing 314.

After the Clippers stopped serving the Marine Air Terminal, the hangar was used to store maintenance vehicles, as well as for LaGuardia Airport&#x27;s executive offices. , the hangar still exists and is known as Hangar 7. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey uses the structure as a garage for the airport&#x27;s snow-removal vehicles. The roof of the hangar contains &quot;Spirit of Flight&quot;, a sculpture of a bird whose wingspan measures wide. The sculpture was formerly placed atop the roof of LaGuardia&#x27;s Domestic Terminal, which was razed in 1963.

<text>Great Camp Sagamore is one of several historic Great Camps located in the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York State.

==History==
Great Camp Sagamore was constructed by William West Durant on Sagamore Lake between 1895 and 1897. Prior to Sagamore, William Durant had constructed Camp Pine Knot (purchased by Collis P. Huntington and now the Huntington Memorial Outdoor Education Center ) on nearby Raquette Lake and Camp Uncas (once owned by J. P. Morgan) on Lake Mohegan. All three camps are still in use today.

The camp is arranged in two complexes a half-mile apart, the Upper, or worker&#x27;s complex, and the Lower, or guest complex. The guests would not have frequented the worker&#x27;s complex, as the buildings at the Upper complex are much more utilitarian than those in the Guest complex, and without the embellishment of the buildings designed for entertaining. Sagamore served as a sylvan setting in which the richest families in America could relax, party, and get a feeling of returning to nature. All of this, however, was accomplished without leaving the comforts of civilization behind.

In 1901 Durant was forced to sell Sagamore because a lawsuit by his sister over his mismanagement of their mother&#x27;s estate had pushed him to the edge of bankruptcy. It was purchased by Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, who expanded and improved the property to include flush toilets, a sewer system and hot and cold running water. He later added a hydroelectric plant and an outdoor bowling alley with an ingenious system for retrieving the balls. Other amenities included a tennis court, a croquet lawn, a 100,000 gallon reservoir, and a working farm. Vanderbilt died in 1915, a victim of the Lusitania sinking, leaving Sagamore to his widow Margaret Emerson, an avid sportswoman who continued to occupy the camp seasonally for many years.

Mrs. Emerson transferred the property to Syracuse University, which operated a conference center at the site until the State of New York offered to buy it. Acquisition by the State as part of the Forest Preserve would have required demolition of the historic buildings, because of the &quot;Forever Wild&quot; provision of the New York State Constitution. To avert this, the Preservation League of New York State arranged with the State to take title, transferring the property with deed restrictions to a not-for-profit institution that would provide suitable occupancy. Great Camp Sagamore has continued to function as an education institution dedicated to the preservation of the National Historic Landmark.

A portion of Sagamore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. A boundary increase for additional area was included in a multiple property submission for listing in 1986. The camp was designated as a National Historic Landmark on 16 May 2000.
The historic camp is now run by Sagamore Institute of the Adirondacks, Inc. and is open to the public by guided tour, as well as offering accommodations and educational programming May through October.

<doc id="978124" wikidata="Q1984412" url="?curid=978124" title="Ngāti Maniapoto">
<text>Ngāti Maniapoto is an iwi (tribe) based in the Waikato-Waitomo region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is part of the Tainui confederation, the members of which trace their whakapapa (genealogy) back to people who arrived in New Zealand on the waka (canoe) Tainui. The 2018 New Zealand census reports show an estimated population of 45,930 people who affiliated with Maniapoto, making it the 9th most-populous iwi in New Zealand.

==History==

Ngāti Maniapoto trace their lineage to their eponymous ancestor Maniapoto, an 11th generation descendant of the people who arrived on the &quot;Tainui&quot; waka and settled at the Kawhia Harbour. His father Rereahu led the Tainui expansion to the interior of the Waikato region, and Maniapoto settled in the southern Waikato area. Maniapoto&#x27;s older brother Te Ihinga-a-rangi settled at Maungatautari, forming the Ngāti Hauā and Ngāti Korokī Kahukura iwi.

==Hapū and marae==

There are many marae (area in front of a wharenui) in the Ngāti Maniapoto area, one of the notable ones being Te Tokanga Nui A Noho at Te Kuiti (the narrowing) in King Country. This whare was given to Ngāti Maniapoto by Te Kooti, a Rongowhakaata guerilla fighter who lived in the region for the period while on the run from colonial forces which undertook searches for him during the New Zealand Wars. Of equal significance but less publicly known is Tiroa Pā where the last Io whare wānanga (traditional study centre) was held in a specially crafted whare called Te Whetu Marama o Hinawa at Te Miringa Te Kakara. The other whare wānanga was near present-day Piopio and was called Kahuwera. It stood on the hill of the same name and commanded a panoramic view of the Mokau River valley across the Maraetaua block.

===Ngāti Te Kanawa===

Ngāti Te Kanawa is an iwi based in Taumarunui and one of the forty main hapū of the Ngāti Maniapoto confederation, which came into existence around 1860. They trace their whakapapa to the tupuna (ancestor) Te Kanawa, who was the great-great-great grandson of the tupuna Maniapoto and comes off Uruhina (child of Rungaterangi and Pareraukawa). The families who carry the name Te Kanawa today have a direct male blood line whakapapa to the tupuna Te Kanawa, also known as Te Kanawa Pango.

<text>Praze an Beeble (), sometimes shortened to Praze, is a village in Cornwall, Great Britain. It lies between the nearby towns of Camborne (2.5 miles) and Helston (7 miles) in the civil parish of Crowan.

The name Praze an Beeble was first recorded in 1697 and means the meadow of the pipe/conduit. The pipe can still be seen in the well at SW 6385 3571 opposite the entrance to the Praze medical centre. Contrary to popular belief, the village is not named after the watercourse through the village, which is called the Praze Stream, and was never historically known as the Beeble. Indeed, the upper part of it was the &quot;Cargenwyn Stream&quot; according to the Camborne Water Co. in 1866. It eventually joins the Red River north of Nancemellin near Gwithian. The Red River in Cornish is &quot;Dowr Koner&quot;.

Early development in the village was focused around the cross-roads, alongside which there was an inn, a smithy and two coaching houses. The buildings which housed the smithy, two cottages and the inn still remain and are Grade II listed. The settlement appears to have developed as planned, a landlord-controlled, estate village for Clowance, to supply services and housing for the mining industry in the area and also to provide housing for agricultural workers. Its main period of growth until the 20th century was between 1809 and 1840. In this part of the 19th century the rows of cottages lining the road leading north to Camborne were built. In 1897 Polsue described it as &quot;a respectable, compact, and well-built village&quot;. Although the population of the village fell between 1881 and 1931 it has subsequently increased. Some building took place south of the village centre between 1906 and 1946, but the majority of modern development has been to the east of the original planned estate village.

Praze has grown to become the largest village in Crowan parish.

==Facilities==

As of September 2004, a good number of facilities (for a village of its size in the region) remained, including a fish and chip shop, bakery, village shop &amp; Post Office, St Aubyn&#x27;s Arms public house, and medical practice. The local school is located just outside the village to the east, although it is associated by name with the neighbouring village Crowan.

From 1887 to 1962 the village had its own railway station on the Helston Railway.

Recent developments in the village have all centred on the ongoing works in Fore Street, including plans to alter street furniture and manage traffic, redeveloping the disused police house at the top of Fore Street, updating the Playing Field donated by Mr G Sims of Little 
Trefewha to the village in memory of his late wife and children&#x27;s play area. The Playing field is home to Praze Cricket Club.
The holiday resort of Clowance estate is just outside the village, offering leisure and dining.

==Annual events==
Every July locals and visitors enjoy the Praze Fair, which involves a parade of local residents and pupils from Crowan School, and a local marching band, and is preceded by a week-long visit from a touring funfair. Also in the summer is the annual Farmers&#x27; Ball, when the village&#x27;s youth congregate in a marquee on the football field to drink and dance.

<text>The Journal of Irreproducible Results is a magazine of science humor. It was established in Israel in 1955 by virologist Alexander Kohn and physicist Harry J. Lipkin, who wanted a humor magazine about science, for scientists. It contains a mix of jokes, satire of scientific practice, science cartoons, and discussion of funny but real research.

It has passed through several hands and as of 2015 is published in San Mateo, California.

==History ==
Alexander Kohn and Harry J. Lipkin founded &quot;The Journal of Irreproducible Results&quot; in 1955 in Ness Ziona, Israel. Kohn remained editor until 1989. Lipkin remained an editor until volume 16, number 1, August 1967, when Kohn became Editor-in-Chief, and Lipkin became one of the associate editors.

Medical researcher George H. Scherr was the publisher from 1964 to 1989, after which &quot;JIR&quot; was published by Blackwell Scientific Publications. Under Blackwell, James A. Krosschell was editor and publisher starting with volume 35, number 1, 1990, and remained publisher throughout the Blackwell ownership. Marc Abrahams was editor from 1991, to the next-to-last Blackwell issue in 1994, when he left to form the rival &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot; (&quot;AIR&quot;) and create the Ig Nobel Prize. The final Blackwell issue, volume 39, number 3, was edited by Leslie A. Gaffney.

In 1994, Blackwell returned &quot;JIR&quot; to George Scherr, who was publisher and editor until 2003, during which time he pursued a number of legal complaints against Abrahams and &quot;AIR&quot;, even as the journal&#x27;s publication became erratic.

&quot;JIR&quot; received attention from American military intelligence when a copy of one of their articles was found among other papers in an abandoned terrorist headquarters in Kabul. The article was a highly unrealistic and farcical explanation of how to build a nuclear weapon that an unwitting Al Qaida member had filed away. Nonetheless, the discovery prompted a short-lived official investigation.

Astronomer Norman Sperling, an assistant editor at &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine, became editor and publisher of the journal in 2004, with promises to rejuvenate it.

<doc id="978149" wikidata="Q572695" url="?curid=978149" title="Eisenmenger syndrome">
<text>Eisenmenger syndrome or Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome is defined as the process in which a long-standing left-to-right cardiac shunt caused by a congenital heart defect (typically by a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, or less commonly, patent ductus arteriosus) causes pulmonary hypertension and eventual reversal of the shunt into a cyanotic right-to-left shunt. Because of the advent of fetal screening with echocardiography early in life, the incidence of heart defects progressing to Eisenmenger syndrome has decreased.

Eisenmenger syndrome in a pregnant mother can cause serious complications, though successful delivery has been reported. Maternal mortality ranges from 30% to 60%, and may be attributed to fainting spells, blood clots forming in the veins and traveling to distant sites, hypovolemia, coughing up blood or preeclampsia. Most deaths occur either during or within the first weeks after delivery. Pregnant women with Eisenmenger syndrome should be hospitalized after the 20th week of pregnancy, or earlier if clinical deterioration occurs.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome include the following:
* Cyanosis (a blue tinge to the skin resulting from lack of oxygen)
* High red blood cell count
* Swollen or clubbed fingertips (clubbing)
* Fainting (also known as syncope)
* Heart failure
* Abnormal heart rhythms
* Bleeding disorders
* Coughing up blood
* Iron deficiency
* Infections (endocarditis and pneumonia)
* Kidney problems
* Stroke
* Gout (rarely) due to increased uric acid resorption and production with impaired excretion
* Gallstones
One of the most severe and common complications of Eisenmenger syndrome is cardiac arrhythmia, especially supraventricular arrhythmias. Approximately 40% of patients diagnosed with Eisenmenger syndrome were also found to have these arrhythmias during routine ECG screenings. These arrhythmias have worse prognosis in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, compared to the general population, and can be a source of sudden cardiac death.

==Causes==
A number of congenital heart defects can cause Eisenmenger syndrome, including atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and more complex types of acyanotic heart disease.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome is typically conducted via transthoracic echocardiography, which facilitates the identification and evaluation of shunts, anatomical defects, and ventricular function. Following diagnosis, or in some cases of inconclusive diagnosis, a cardiac catheter may be used to both confirm the diagnosis and to assess the patient&#x27;s pulmonary arterial pressure, an important predictive value for prognosis and treatment.

==Treatment==
If the inciting defect in the heart is identified &quot;before&quot; it causes significant pulmonary hypertension, it can normally be repaired through surgery, preventing the disease. After pulmonary hypertension is sufficient to reverse the blood flow through the defect, however, the maladaptation is considered irreversible, and a heart–lung transplant or a lung transplant with repair of the heart is the only curative option.
Transplantation is the final therapeutic option and only for patients with poor prognosis and quality of life. Timing and appropriateness of transplantation remain difficult decisions. 5-year and 10-year survival ranges between 70% and 80%, 50% and 70%, 30% and 50%, respectively. Since the average life expectancy of patients after lung transplantation is as low as 30% at 5 years, patients with &quot;reasonable functional status&quot; related to Eisenmenger syndrome have &quot;improved survival with conservative medical care&quot; compared with transplantation.

Various medicines and therapies for pulmonary hypertension are under investigation for treatment of the symptoms.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are important for many patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, as evidence suggests that arrhythmia-induced sudden cardiac death may be the leading cause of death among patients with the disease. These therapies generally aim to restore and maintain sinus rhythm, but the specific interventions chosen will depend on the nature of the patient&#x27;s arrhythmia.

==Etymology==
Eisenmenger syndrome was named by Paul Wood after Victor Eisenmenger, who first described the condition in 1897.

<text>Dead Man&#x27;s Hand is a first-person shooter game developed by Human Head Studios and published by Atari. It was released in North America for Xbox and Microsoft Windows in March 2004. The game takes place in the American frontier.

==Story==
El Tejon was a member of the notorious &quot;Nine&quot; who was betrayed because he did not join the gang to murder women and children, but to be famous and rich and seeking a chance to make a name for himself, as a gunslinger. The Leader of the Nine shoots him and leaves him for dead. However General San Juan Jacinto Blanco found El Tejon and threw him in a jail cell to rot. But Tejon&#x27;s cellmate Iago is the leader of a revolution that will free both Iago and Tejon to exact vengeance on those who betrayed them.

==Plot==

1890s Mexicos

Tejon is a young gunslinger who joins the gang The Nine. While he enjoys robbing banks and trains, he is not as bloodthirsty as his associates, this eventually leads to a fallout. His leader- Tennessee Vic shoots him in cold blood.

After Tejon is left for dead by Tennessee Vic, he is found by the corrupt General Blanco who leaves him to rot in a prison. Tejon&#x27;s cellmate is the leader of the resistance fighting the general. His men come to free him and Tejon.

Tejon&#x27;s first trip is to Sanchez. He was the drunk of the group but also known to find hideouts for the group. After gunning down Sanchez and his men. He is approached by his former lover who hears about it and seeks to aid in his quest. He refuses saying it is personal and dangerous.

Flat Iron is Tejon&#x27;s next target. Flat Iron is a renegade Comanche whose skilled with knives. He is a much more formidable opponent, on the account of his speed and sharp knives. After confronting Flat Iron, Tejon kills him.

In between missions, Tejon hunts down a criminal known simply as BlackJack- an overweight drunk- who’s a crack shot with a rifle.

Tejon then confronts “Numbers”. Numbers was the banker of the group. He was also seen as cowardly and easily pushed around. Numbers heard about Sanchez and prepares. Tejon also kills him with ease. Along the way Tejon, picks up bounties who are either helpful to find the nine or extra money.

He goes to the lumber mill owned by Big Guns Grissom, the strongman of the Nine. What he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in brute force. He proves to be a more tough opponent as he is capable of throwing axes with accuracy. Tejon confronts him and blows up what is left of his mill.

Next on the list is Father Zeke, a jacklegged preacher who hustles his congregations to help build his lavish lifestyle. He often quotes scripture when taunting his enemies. His signature weapon is whiskey bombs. Tejon confronts him in one of his churches, after he kills Zeke, he goes to his house and destroys it.

Remembering that his cellmate Iago needs his help, Tejon goes back to Mexico to fight General Blanco. While he is battling the general, he rallies to the remaining rebels and defeats him once and for all.

He then returns to the trail of the Nine. He is seeking a well known gambler, whose name is Kendall. Kendall has local connections and uses them to hide. Tejon kills the sons of the local madam who knows where Kendall is. He then confronts the Madam himself. After killing her, he is able to clear a path to his own friend. Kendall is the smooth talker and ladies man of the Nine. Known to be a quick draw when needed. He too is a much harder opponent to kill as he is crafty and shrewd. Tejon finds him and kills him at his saloon.

Tejon is once again confronted by his lover, he agrees to let her help after they find themselves hunted by now Senator Vic’s corrupted marshal corps.

With not many enemies left- he begins to hunt for the Twins- two identical twins who can read each other’s mind. He travels to find their lumber mill and kills them both.

Vic now has prepared for Tejon’s arrival, he has a trained fitted with mercenaries and marshals to stop Tejon. When he guns his way through, Vic admits he never wanted to kill Tejon because he viewed him as a son, but Tejon refuses, as Vic attemperà to flee, Tejon blows up the tracks and the train crashes, both men survive. What’s left of Vic’s bodyguards try to kill Tejon but he dispatches them once and for all. Vic now left defenseless is killed- Tejon and his lover both ride off in the sunset, with his revenge now gone full circle.

==Gameplay==
The game is somewhat unusual in that between levels, the player plays poker for extra health and ammunition. The character is armed with four default weapons; a knife, a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. Other weapons that can be found are TNT and Whisky bombs. The player can shoot objects such as whisky bottles, cans and enemies to score legend points, thus filling up the &quot;trick shot&quot; meter that lets the character use the secondary mode of firing which varies depending on the current weapon. The combat in the game also makes use of the game&#x27;s physics engine, with the player being able to trigger physics based traps such as shooting a rock and causing it to fall onto an enemy below - kills obtained this way are rewarded with extra points and a greater increase in the &quot;trick shot&quot; meter.

==Development==
The game was originally set to release in Fall 2003.

==Reception==
&quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Hand &quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the Xbox version was ported for release as part of the Xbox World Collection on September 2, 2004, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of two sevens, one six, and one seven for a total of 27 out of 40.

&quot;Playboy&quot; gave the Xbox version an early review, over three months before it was released Stateside, and stated, &quot;A unique scoring system lets you unlock killer trick shots - if ya ain&#x27;t a coward that is.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; gave the game four stars out of five and stated, &quot;The Wild West theme lends itself well to the FPS treatment, and the primitive weaponry brings an almost liberating freedom to the gameplay. Given the game&#x27;s fairly tame content, its 16+ age rating seems harsh.&quot; However, &quot;Maxim&quot; gave it three stars out of five, saying, &quot;The concept and play consistently deal a royal flush, [but] just ignore the choppy visuals, which can irritate like a pesky infection picked up at Miss Kitty&#x27;s Cat House.&quot;

<text>The British Rail Class 86 is a class of electric locomotives built during the 1960s. Developed as a &#x27;standard&#x27; electric locomotive from earlier prototype models, one hundred of these locomotives were built from 1965 to 1966 to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line (WCML) from London Euston to Birmingham, , Liverpool, Manchester and later Glasgow and . Introduction of the class enabled the replacement of many steam locomotives, which were finally withdrawn by British Rail in 1968.

Under the earlier BR classification system, the type was given the designation AL6 (meaning the sixth design of AC locomotive) and locomotives were numbered E3101–E3200. In 1968, this was changed to &quot;Class 86&quot; when British Rail introduced the TOPS classification system.

The class was built to haul passenger and freight trains alike on the West Coast Main Line; however, some members of the class also saw use on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML) between and , after the remainder of the line north of Colchester was electrified in the mid-1980s. The type has had a generally long and successful career, with some members of the class seeing main line service lives in the UK of up to 55 years. Most regular passenger duties of the class came to end on both the WCML and the GEML in the early-to-mid-2000s, after a career of up to 40 years. Some members of the class remained in use for charter work and for freight work with Freightliner until 2021. A number of the class were exported to Bulgaria and Hungary and remain in use. , three Class 86s remain preserved in usable condition in the UK; all are in private ownership.

==Development and construction==
The class was developed as a result of experience with the earlier prototype classes 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85; these had been produced by different manufacturers in the early days of the WCML electrification, as test-beds for locomotive development.

The AL6 featured design elements pioneered on the earlier classes, such as the general construction of the bodies and bogies, and control systems. However, some design features were unique, such as the squarer front ends (as opposed to the raked back noses of the earlier designs), the lack of a second pantograph and the cooling fans, which were redesigned to produce less noise than the earlier locos. A major departure from the designs of the earlier prototype locomotives came in the use of axle-hung, rather than frame mounted traction motors; this feature would later prove very problematic for the class.

The order for 100 locomotives was placed in 1963; it was split between two manufacturers, with the English Electric Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows building 60 locomotives and British Rail Doncaster Works producing 40. The Doncaster and Newton-built locomotives were not identical; the Newton-built versions had a power output of , whilst the Doncaster-built examples were rated at , due to a different design of traction motor.

==British Rail service==
The class was introduced officially into service in August 1965; the entire fleet was delivered within 24 months of that date. In the early years, the locomotives became notorious for rough riding, and causing track damage, being fitted with axle-hung traction motors in place of the bogie-frame-mounted motors of the earlier designs; this additional unsprung mass was causing damage at speeds in excess of . In 1969, E3173 was fitted experimentally with the large helical &#x27;flexicoil&#x27; springs. Trials carried out under the direction of the British Rail Research Division proved successful and the modification was applied gradually in phases to the whole fleet.

As a result, the first batch of Class 86s were modified with improved suspension and, from 1971 onwards, locomotives were renumbered progressively into two subclasses; 86/0 (numbers 86001–86048), which remained in as-built condition, and had their maximum speed reduced from to and which were generally restricted to use on freight and slower passenger services, and subclass 86/2 (86204–86252), which were fitted with the improved suspension and retained the 100 mph maximum speed. Within a short time, a further batch was modified to the new specification and renumbered accordingly; 86040–86048 became 86253–86261.

In 1970, locomotive E3173 was also fitted experimentally with a streamlined nose cone made from fibreglass; this was to assist BR&#x27;s research into aerodynamics and high-speed running for their new Advanced Passenger Train and High Speed Train, which were under development. The locomotive was tested on the WCML in the area; it reportedly reached speeds of , which made it the first BR locomotive to beat Mallard&#x27;s speed record. The record was not publicised however, as BR did not want the event to overshadow their new trains. 

At the same time, three Class 86s were converted into test-bed locomotives for development of the Class 87; they were numbered initially to 86201–86203, refitted with BP9 bogies but were renumbered quickly to a new 86/1 subclass; 86101–86103. These locomotives were capable of running. The most obvious visual difference between the classes is that the Class 86 has a windscreen with three windows, whereas the Class 87 only has two; likewise, the Class 86 was fitted with headcode boxes (later plated over) while the Class 87 was built without them.

By the late-1970s, there was a need for more locomotives capable of operating at 100 mph. To achieve this, nineteen 86/0s were modified by the use of SAB resilient wheels, a new design of wheel in two sections separated by a rubber bearing, which allowed their top speed to be raised. The converted locos (86011–86029) were renumbered into the 86/3 series (86311–86329). As the SAB wheels were found to be insufficient for preventing track damage, in 1984 BR decided to refit all of their remaining 86/0 and 86/3 locos with flexicoil suspension, and by the mid-1980s all of the modified 86/0s and 86/3s were renumbered again as 86/4s, allowing a standardised fleet capable of 100 mph running.

Further electrification of the Great Eastern Main Line in the 1980s beyond to Harwich, and saw the class employed on passenger trains from to these locations; Ipswich was energised in 1985 and Norwich in 1987. Class 86s would operate inter-city passenger services to Norwich and boat trains to Harwich until 2005, when they were replaced fully by Class 90s. In addition, many of the freightliner trains to Felixstowe were also hauled as far as Ipswich by Class 86 locomotives working in multiple. The West Anglia Main Line from Liverpool Street to was also electrified at the same time and Class 86s hauled services on this route from 1987 until 1989.

A later development saw Class 86/2 and 86/4 locomotives fitted with time-division multiplexing to enable them to operate push-pull passenger trains. The main benefit of this was the requirement for fewer locomotives; for example, a second locomotive would otherwise have to join at the other end of the train after arrival at terminal stations to lead the train&#x27;s onward journey. 52 Driving Van Trailers were manufactured and introduced to the WCML in 1988 to enable push-pull trains; Driving Brake Standard Opens were transferred later from Scotland to the GEML to work with their Class 86/2s. The 86/4s were already fitted with an older multiple-working system and this was gradually phased out after TDM was fitted across the fleet.
Sectorisation of British Rail in the late 1980s, saw the fleet split up again; the 86/2s were dedicated to the InterCity sector for use on express passenger trains, whilst the majority of the 86/4 subclass were dedicated to freight and parcels traffic. As a result, many had their electric train heating isolated and were re-geared to a lower maximum speed of , these were usually operated in pairs on long-distance freight services. These locomotives were reclassified as a new subclass 86/6. Eight Class 86/2 locomotives were also dedicated to freight work and were reclassified as Class 86/5, being renumbered into the range 86501–86508. However, the InterCity sector of BR decided that it wanted these locomotives back, so they were soon renumbered back to Class 86/2s. For a period of one year starting on 10 May 1992, six Class 86/6s were returned to Parcels use. These were renumbered back to class 86/4, as follows: 86405, 86411, 86414, 86415, 86428 and 86431. All six remained in Railfreight&#x27;s Triple Grey livery.

The late 1980s also saw the introduction of many new liveries. The class had previously worn rail blue when built with cast lion-and-wheel emblems, but this was replaced by the standard BR Blue livery from 1967 with a cast-metal double arrow symbol. The first new livery was introduced by the InterCity sector in 1984 with the unveiling of an &#x27;InterCity Executive&#x27; livery, with dark grey upper body, tan lower body separated by red and white stripes, with wrap around yellow cabsides and yellow cab roofs.
InterCity undertook a rebranding of &quot;InterCity Swallow&quot; livery in 1987 on InterCity 125s, Class 90s and Class 91s, which were in the final stages of construction. Class 86/4s were still used on a mixed traffic basis on InterCity express trains, parcels, Speedlink and Freightliner traffic, so a modernised version of InterCity livery was used, commonly known as &#x27;Mainline&#x27; livery. The red and white stripes and tan bands covered the whole bodyside, and the roof was dark grey. The whole of the ends were painted yellow, although some were repainted dark grey around the front windows.
It wasn&#x27;t until 1990 that the first Class 86 received InterCity Swallow livery, when a full sector ownership was established.
The Railfreight sector introduced its new two tone grey livery in 1987, initially without sub-sector logos due to shared operations on Speedlink and Freightliner duties. Four Class 86s received Railfreight General logos from June 1988, but all Class 86/6 locomotives carried Railfreight Distribution livery beginning in January 1990. Finally, the parcels sector introduced a new red and grey livery with repaints from July 1990 to July 1991, which was replaced with Rail Express Systems livery applied between December 1991 to February 1995.

==Former operators==
In the mid-1990s, British Rail was privatised and the Class 86 fleet was divided among several operators. These are dealt with separately below.

===Anglia Railways/One===
Anglia Railways was one of three passenger franchises to inherit the class. A fleet of 15 locomotives were inherited, which were used to exclusively haul London Liverpool Street- inter-city services. The locomotives were used in push-pull mode with Mk 2E and Mk 2F coaching stock and a Driving Brake Standard Open, which removed the need for the locomotive to swap ends at the termini. Generally, the locomotive was at the south, or London, end of a formation, with the DBSO at the north, or country, end of the trainthis was to aid simple switchover of locomotives close to their home depot, Norwich Crown Point.

In 1998, Anglia Railways introduced a new livery of turquoise, with a central white stripe. The first locomotive to be treated was no. 86223 &quot;Norwich Union&quot;, followed quickly by no. 86218 &quot;NHS 50&quot;. Over the next few years the whole fleet was treated as they received works overhauls at Springburn Works, Glasgow.
Over the years, several of the Anglia fleet were withdrawn following mishaps. For example, nos. 86220, 86221 and 86237, were withdrawn in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively, following transformer failures. Another machine, no. 86252, was written off in 2002 after catching fire near Colchester on 1 December 2001 whilst no. 86257 was withdrawn in 2003 due to its general bad condition. These locomotives were replaced by locomotives made redundant from Virgin CrossCountry (nos. 86234/242) or West Coast (nos. 86209/260) franchises. Another locomotive, no. 86227, was reinstated to traffic in 2002 after being stored for many years. It was repainted in a variation of Anglia&#x27;s livery, with a large Union Flag painted on the side and named &quot;Golden Jubilee&quot; to commemorate Elizabeth II&#x27;s 50th anniversary of her reign.

The first major changes to the fleet occurred in late 2002, when Anglia started to hire Class 90 locomotives from Freightliner. This was because, at the time, the Class 86 fleet was suffering from reliability problems. In late 2003, Anglia swapped to using English Welsh &amp; Scottish owned Class 90 locomotives, hiring up to five at any one time. Consequently, the use of the Class 86 fleet was decreased, which subsequently allowed reliability to improve.

In early 2004, two locomotives suffered from serious transformer failures. One locomotive, no. 86246, was subsequently repaired, but the other, no. 86237, was withdrawn and later scrapped. This prompted the suggestion that the Anglia Class 86 fleet be replaced by the 15 Class 90 locomotives from Virgin Trains, which were soon to be made redundant by the introduction of new Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; units.
On 1 April 2004, the Anglia Railways franchise ended and the franchise was merged with the other operators in East Anglia to form the new Greater Anglia franchise operated by One. With this came the news that the Class 86 fleet would progressively be replaced by Class 90 locomotives, cascaded from Virgin Trains. The first day of the new franchise saw two Class 90 locomotives unveiled in the new franchisee&#x27;s &#x27;One&#x27; livery. However, despite this announcement, one Class 86 locomotive, no. 86235, was authorised a complete overhaul. As such, this locomotive became the last to receive classified repairs.

For the first few months of the new franchise, all of the Class 86 fleet was retained, to insure against reliability issues with the new Class 90 locomotives. However, in October 2004, the fleet was reduced to just six examples, these being nos. 86218/232/234/235/246/260. The rest were withdrawn, but three (nos. 86217/223/250) were subsequently sold to Fragonset Railways. By December, the fleet stood at just two operational locomotives, these being nos. 86235 &quot;Crown Point&quot; and 86246 &quot;Royal Anglian Regiment&quot;. These were the last two locomotives to receive classified repairs and consequently were the most reliable, in theory at least.

It was originally planned to withdraw these final two locomotives on 31 December 2004. However, all did not go to plan, as the replacement Class 90 locomotives did not prove to be as reliable as hoped. Therefore, two locomotives were reprieved until at least March 2005. A final twist saw no. 86232 repaired, replacing no. 86246, which had again suffered from a serious failure. A third locomotive, no. 86234, was also repaired and briefly returned to traffic in April 2005, but was later stored again after failing. The last two locomotives (nos. 86232/235) saw occasional use when insufficient Class 90 locomotives were available. By mid-2005, no. 86232 was out of use and no. 86235 was operational but not used. The final use of the class came on 17 September 2005, when no. 86235 was used on several Norwich-London return trips to mark its retirement from service. This brought an end to 40 years of Class 86-hauled passenger trains.

===Colas Rail===
86701 joined the Colas Rail fleet and was painted into the Colas Rail yellow and orange livery in October 2012. This, however, was short lived, as it was withdrawn from mainline use in January 2013. In 2015, it was used for contractual work at Ilford depot. In March 2016, it was transferred to Europhoenix, where it was subsequently exported to Bulgaria for further use.

===Caledonian Sleeper===
On 31 March 2015, the new Caledonian Sleeper contract started, following takeover of the contract from DB Schenker. In February 2015, 86101 was repainted into the new Caledonian Blue livery. From 31 March 2015, 86101 was used to convey the empty sleeper coaching stock between London Euston and Wembley Intercity Depot, as well as between Glasgow Central and Polmadie TRSMD, along with 87002. After a lengthy refurbishment, 86401 joined the Caledonian Sleeper fleet on 8 August 2015. In October 2019, the Class 86s were withdrawn, primarily due to coupler incompatibility, and returned to the AC Locomotive Group.

===English, Welsh &amp; Scottish Railway===

English Welsh &amp; Scottish inherited a small fleet of 15 locomotives when it bought the Rail Express Systems parcels business. The locomotives were employed on mail trains from London King&#x27;s Cross to and Birmingham to Glasgow. One of the locomotives, no. 86239 &quot;LS Lowry&quot;, was destroyed in an accident at Stafford in 1996.

EWS soon diversified the use of its fleet, hiring its locomotives to charter train operators and also to Virgin Trains, to supplement their unreliable fleet. Three locomotives (nos. 86261/401/426) were repainted into EWS&#x27;s red and gold livery.

The rundown of the fleet started in 2001, when the locomotives were replaced on charter and mail trains by Class 67 or Class 90 locomotives. They saw continued use with Virgin Trains, however, but were gradually withdrawn as new Class 390 Pendolino units entered service, reducing the need for hired locomotives. By the end of their working careers, most of the EWS locomotives were in an appalling state and suffered from numerous failures. The final locomotives, nos. 86210/401/424 were withdrawn from traffic in late 2002.

Following withdrawal from traffic, two locomotives (nos. 86426/430) were subsequently reinstated and hired to Freightliner, on a long-term contract. This was due to a Class 90 locomotive, no. 90150, being written off due to fire damage, resulting in a shortage of electric traction. The two locomotives were repainted into Freightliner&#x27;s racing green livery and employed on intermodal traffic, with the rest of Freightliner&#x27;s Class 86 fleet. The contract ended in mid-2004, following deliveries of new Class 66 locomotives, meaning that the two electric locomotives were surplus to requirements and they were withdrawn from traffic.

In late 2003, with the exception of the two locomotives on hire to Freightliner, EWS advertised all of its remaining locomotives for sale. Most were subsequently sold for scrap, but one locomotive (no. 86401) was preserved (later hired in and used by GB Railfreight on the Caledonian Sleeper contract), whilst two others (nos. 86210/424) were sold for further use with Network Rail and reclassified class 86/9. The former Freightliner pair were sold to C F Booth in late 2005.

===FM Rail===
FM Rail (previously Fragonset Railways) briefly leased several locomotives from HSBC Rail. These locomotives were previously used by Anglia Railways (86217/223/250), Virgin Cross-Country (86231/251) and Virgin West Coast (86229/233). One locomotive, ex-Virgin 86212, was hauled to East Ham Depot in London to be used for carriage power duties for the new Blue Pullman train. However, it did not operate services on the mainline.

FM Rail entered administration in December 2006, without having returned any of their Class 86 locomotives to traffic and they were returned to the lease company.
===Freightliner===

Freightliner inherited a large fleet of thirty Class 86/6 freight-dedicated locomotives, most of which had previously been operated by Railfreight Distribution, but some came from Rail Express Systems. The fleet therefore consisted of locomotives in many different obsolete liveries so, from 1995, Freightliner started to apply its newly introduced livery. This was based on the previous Trainload two-tone grey, with the addition of Freightliner red triangle logo.

The Freightliner fleet were originally employed on intermodal traffic along the northern half of the WCML from Crewe to Coatbridge (near Glasgow). The steep gradients along this route meant that trains were hauled by pairs of locomotives working in multiple. The class also worked services south from Crewe to Tilbury and Ipswich (for onwards movement to Felixstowe by diesel locomotive), and some services to Trafford Park in Manchester. The class have occasionally been used on the East Coast Main Line, particularly when services are diverted due to engineering works.

In 1998, following the introduction of the rebuilt Class 57 diesel locomotives, Freightliner introduced a new livery of racing green with yellow cabsides. The first Class 86 to appear in this livery was no. 86631, which was hurriedly repainted for display at an open day at Toton. The majority of the fleet have slowly been treated over the years, such that by the end of 2004, only a handful remained in the original two-tone grey livery.

In 2000, locomotive no. 86608 was experimentally regeared to allow it to work trains single-handedly. It was reclassified as Class 86/5 and renumbered to 86501. This was the second time this classification and number had been used. The first occasion being former 86/2s dedicated to freight work in the late 1980s (86258 having previously held the 86501 number). Despite the apparent success of 86501&#x27;s conversion, no further locomotives have been similar regeared. In mid-2004, the locomotive suffered fire damage, but was subsequently repaired and returned to service. 86501 again suffered fire damage in August 2008 near Bletchley. It was subsequently repaired in December 2008 and returned to service again shortly after.

Due to a locomotive shortage in 2002, two further locomotives, nos. 86426/430, were hired from English Welsh &amp; Scottish, which had just withdrawn its last examples. Since the hire contract was long-term, both locomotives were repainted in Freightliner green livery. They were used in a common pool with the rest of the fleet. By 2004, the need for the extra locomotives was reduced, so both were returned to EWS and subsequently withdrawn.

Two other locomotives, nos. 86101/102, formerly used by Virgin Trains, were also briefly hired by Freightliner in 2001/2002. Neither of these locomotives were repainted and they both retained obsolete InterCity livery. Due to their non-standard nature, both locomotives had been withdrawn by early 2002.

Following the withdrawal of the Anglia Railways, Virgin Trains and EWS fleets, Freightliner became the last operator of the class. In January 2005, it had an operational fleet of twenty-two locomotives, with several more in warm-storage (capable of being returned to traffic). In the last few years, however, several locomotives have been withdrawn from service, mainly due to the influx of new Class 66 diesel locomotives; in addition, two locomotives (nos. 86611/631) were written off following the Norton Bridge rail crash and another three (nos. 86615/620/621) have been withdrawn following fire damage and subsequently scrapped. In addition, Freightliner&#x27;s Class 90 fleet, which were previously hired to passenger operators Virgin Trains and Anglia Railways, have now all returned to the company, thus reducing the requirement for the Class 86 fleet. However, Freightliner retained a core fleet of sixteen locomotives, with two locomotives (nos. 86622/637) repainted into Freightliner Powerhaul livery.

By early 2021, the fleet was down to just two locomotives, and these final two were withdrawn from service in March, replaced by ex-Greater Anglia Class 90s.

In July and August 2023, all 16 Freightliner Class 86/6s were purchased by Express Services, Bulgaria and exported.

===Hull Trains===

The open-access passenger operator Hull Trains obtained the use of 86101 (one of the preserved Class 86 locomotives), between January and April 2008, to provide cover in the short term for its badly damaged Class 222 &quot;Pioneer&quot; DMU. The locomotive, together with a rake of Mark 3 coaches, was introduced to public services between London and Doncaster on 11 January 2008, following several months of tests and training, and ran until 20 April 2008 when Class 180 &quot;Adelante&quot; DMUs were introduced to the service.

===Vintage Trains===
In 2008, privately owned and preserved 86259 was returned to service on the main line, regaining the name of its owner &quot;Les Ross&quot;. It was operated on occasional charters by Vintage Trains from their base at Tyseley and, from 2011, was based at Willesden and available for ad-hoc charters. By August 2011, it had covered 5.7 million miles in service. It is currently cleared for operation at up to .

===Virgin Trains===
The Virgin Rail Group operated two franchises: CrossCountry and InterCity West Coast.

====CrossCountry====
Virgin CrossCountry inherited a fleet of 19 locomotives. These were employed on various services, such as Birmingham New Street to Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool, Edinburgh or . Other services continued south to Birmingham International, whilst others originated from Preston. At Birmingham New Street and Preston, in particular, it was common for the Class 86 locomotive to be removed and replaced with a Class 47 diesel locomotive, before the service continued south to destinations such as Bristol, , , , and .

From 1998 onwards, locomotives began to be outshopped in the new Virgin Trains red and black livery. However, a few locomotives retained the old InterCity livery.

In mid-2001, Virgin CrossCountry started to introduce new Class 220 &quot;Voyager&quot; and Class 221 &quot;Super-Voyager&quot; units. These new trains enabled Virgin to start to retire its older traction. Several of the early withdrawals were transferred to other operators, such as nos. 86234 and 86242 to Anglia Railways. However, the majority of locomotives were retained in service until September 2002, when virtually the entire fleet was withdrawn en masse. Prior to this, Virgin had specially repainted no. 86253 in InterCity livery to commemorate its final few months in traffic. The final CrossCountry operated service was actually operated by no. 86233, from the West-Coast fleet, which had been repainted in original electric blue livery a few weeks earlier.

Since withdrawal from traffic, several locomotives have been scrapped at Immingham Railfreight Terminal. A few locomotives were sold to other operators for further use, such as no. 86253 to Network Rail and nos. 86231/251 to Fragonset Railways. One locomotive, no. 86249, was retained by Virgin until late-2004, as a driver-training locomotive at Polmadie depot in Glasgow.

====West Coast====

Virgin Trains West Coast inherited a small fleet of thirteen locomotives which were employed on West Coast Main Line express trains from London Euston to Birmingham, , Manchester, , Carlisle and . By 2001, the fleet had been cut to nine locomotives, with 86209 being transferred to Anglia Railways and three more (nos. 86101/102/213) withdrawn from traffic.

In 1998, no. 86229 became the first of the class to be repainted in Virgin&#x27;s red and black livery. By 2001, all except one locomotive had been repainted in this livery.

The West Coast fleet contained several &#x27;celebrity&#x27; locomotives, including no. 86245 &quot;Caledonian&quot;, which was repainted into a variant of the Virgin livery using Caledonian Railway blue in place of the standard red, to celebrate the company&#x27;s 150th Anniversary. In 2002, no. 86233 was specially repainted into original electric blue to commemorate the last few months in traffic for the fleet. One locomotive, no. 86228, also retained in the old InterCity livery.

In mid-2003, the rundown of the fleet started as new Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; electrical multiple units entered service. The final three locomotives (nos. 86229/233/247) were removed from traffic in September 2003. The final service being operated by electric blue locomotive no. 86233. Several of the fleet were later transferred to other operators, including Anglia Railways (no. 86260) and Fragonset Railways (nos. 86212/229/233). One former West Coast locomotive (no. 86259) has been preserved.

===Network Rail===
In 2004, Network Rail acquired three locomotives (nos. 86210/253/424), of which the first two were converted to mobile load-bank testing locomotives, with the third used for spares. The two operational locomotives were reclassified as Class 86/9 and renumbered as 86901/902. They were formerly based at Rugby, but were moved and stored at Derby and carried the Network Rail all-over yellow livery. Their primary use was to test the overhead line supply of electrified lines by simulating various loads. Both locomotives were capable of running under their own power for positioning purposes, but could not haul any significant loads. Therefore, when being used to test the overhead supply, they had to be hauled by a diesel locomotive.

As of 8 January 2014, they were removed from service and extracted from Derby by low-loader and taken to Long Marston. 86901 was subsequently taken to Sandbach Car and Commercial Dismantlers, where it was broken up, whilst 86902 suffered the same fate at CF Booth&#x27;s scrapyard in Rotherham. 86424, the erstwhile source of spares, was exported to Hungary, where it is used as a source of spares for the Class 86s that were purchased by Floyd Zrt for freight usage. 86424 was returned to service with Floyd in late 2018, due to Floyd&#x27;s need for an additional Class 86.

==Current operators==
===Bulgaria export===

The first Class 86 to be exported to Bulgaria was 86233 in October 2012. It served as a spares donor for Bulmarket previously exported Class 87s, numbers 87009, 87017, 87023 and 87025. In March 2016, Bulmarket purchased an additional six Class 86 locomotives with the intent of operating them alongside their Class 87 locos. By the end of 2017 they had a fully operational fleet of six locos, renumbered into the 85xxx range:

85001 (ex-86701), 85002 (ex-86702), 85003 (ex-86213), 85004 (ex-86235), 85005 (ex-86231) and 85006 (ex-86234).

During July and August 2023, all sixteen Freightliner Class 86/6s were purchased by Express Services and exported to Bulgaria.

===Hungary export===

In 2008, Europhoenix completed a deal to purchase the remaining Class 86/2 fleet from HSBC Rail Leasing, numbering 23 locomotives, with the intention of overhauling some of them for use in Europe and the UK. 86248 and 86250 were sold to Hungarian private open access freight operator Floyd Zrt and were delivered in February and May 2009, becoming Hungarian Class 450. As of 2020, Floyd Zrt owns nine Class 86 locomotives.

===Locomotive Services===
Following their replacement on the Caledonian Sleeper trains, one of the two class 86s owned by AC Locomotive Group, 86101 &quot;Sir William A Stanier FRS&quot;, was sold to Locomotive Services Limited in November 2019 along with Class 87 no. 87002. 86101 was then repainted from its Caledonian blue livery into InterCity Swallow livery, as were 87002, 90001 and 90002.

===West Coast Railways===

Privately owned class 86, no. 86259, was transferred over from operating with Vintage Trains in around 2012 and is presently used by West Coast Railways hauling excursion trains from London. These have, so far, included the popular &quot;Cumbrian Mountain Express&quot; excursion trains and, in recent times, its first-ever visit to Blackpool along the newly electrified line to Blackpool North while working the &quot;Pennine Blackpool Express&quot;.

In February 2020, West Coast Railway acquired its first Class 86, no. 86401 &quot;Mons Meg&quot;, which had previously been owned by AC Locomotive Group and used on the Caledonian Sleeper services from London to Scotland. Following the replacement of the sleeper&#x27;s Mark 2 and Mark 3 coaches with new Mark 5 coaches, 86401 was taken off lease.

==Preservation==

Currently three locomotives have been preserved, with examples from both manufacturers:

* The first locomotive to be preserved was 86401, which was named &quot;Hertfordshire Rail Tours&quot; at the time. This locomotive was operated by EWS until 2002, when it was one of their three final machines to be withdrawn from traffic. Prior to that, it was the only locomotive of its class to be painted in Network SouthEast livery and was named &quot;Northampton Town&quot;. In this guise, it was used on London Liverpool Street-Cambridge and London Euston-Northampton passenger trains. In 2004, 86401 was preserved by the AC Locomotive Group, which also owns examples of Classes 81-85, based at Barrow Hill Engine Shed. 86401 was deployed initially in the reserve fleet of operational shunting/depot service locomotives at Willesden TMD. In February 2015, 86401 moved to Leicester depot, where it underwent renovation work; modifications included the fitting of GSM-R and OTMR, the recommissioning of the time-division multiplexing system and attention to the components and bodywork. On 12 May 2015, it was moved to Brush Traction where it was repainted into Caledonian Blue livery and renamed &quot;Mons Meg&quot;; it was used subsequently on Serco&#x27;s Caledonian Sleeper contract. The locomotive was purchased by West Coast Railways in February 2020 and is now based at Carnforth MPD; it hauled a small number of railtours in 2022.

* 86101 was preserved by the AC Locomotive Group in August 2005. It was stored initially at MoD Ashchurch, but was restored to working condition at Barrow Hill. On 15 March 2007, it undertook its first test run; it then hauled the Carlisle-Crewe and return legs of &quot;The Ynys Mon Express&quot; railtour to Holyhead on 24 March 2007. In December 2014, after a few years in storage, 86101 made its initial main-line run to and from Willesden TMD. In 2015, 86101 was selected as one of the locomotives to support the new Caledonian Sleeper Services. In February 2015, it was taken to Brush Traction where it was painted into Caledonian Blue livery. From March 2015 to September 2019, it was used to convey empty coaching stock for the Caledonian sleepers between London Euston and Wembley InterCity depot, as well as between Glasgow Central and Polmadie TRSMD, alongside 87002. 86101 was sold subsequently to Locomotive Services Limited in November 2019, along with 87002, and was painted into InterCity Swallow livery; it currently hauls excursions.

* 86259 has been preserved, initially at Tyseley Locomotive Works and, as of late 2017, stabled at Rugby station. It is owned by Les Ross, after whom the locomotive was named. The locomotive is maintained in full operational condition, wearing its initial Electric Blue scheme. The engine also wears different nameplates; on one side, it carries the nameplate &quot;Les Ross&quot; and, on the other, it has the nameplate &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. It also has its original number &quot;E3137&quot; at one end and &quot;86259&quot; at the other. It hauls the &quot;Cumbrian Mountain Express&quot; excursions several times each year, in conjunction with Railway Touring Company.

A further locomotive, 86213, was preserved initially by the AC Locomotive Group, but has since been sold to Bulmarket and exported to Bulgaria.

Three cab sections have been saved from scrapped locomotives. Two cabs from 86247 were saved by the South Wales Cab Preservation Group and one cab from 86902 was saved by a private owner. One cab from 86247 has since been sold to a private owner and is on display at Crewe Heritage Centre.

==Fleet details==

N.B. All locomotives numbered 86253–86261, 863xx, 864xx and 866xx were previously numbered in the 860xx series.

==Accidents==
Over the years, several Class 86 locomotives have been involved in accidents. The most serious of these was the Watford Junction rail crash on 23 January 1975, between Bushey and Watford Junction, when no. 86209 collided head-on with Class 83 no. 83003. The Class 86 was seriously damaged after falling down an embankment, coming to rest in a field (now the site of the Colne Valley Retail Park). It was eventually recovered, several weeks later, by road. Surprisingly, given the seriousness of the incident, it was authorised for repairs and later returned to service.

Also, on 6 June 1975, nos. 86006 and 86242 were involved in the Nuneaton rail crash. The accident happened when the 23:30 sleeper from London Euston to Glasgow derailed after entering a temporary speed restriction at too high a speed, resulting in the loss of six lives. Both locomotives were later repaired. 

Another serious accident was the Colwich rail crash on 19 September 1986, when nos. 86211 and 86429 were involved in a head-on collision. Both locomotives were written off and subsequently scrapped at Crewe Works over the following year.

On 8 March 1996, a Travelling Post Office train hauled by no. 86239 collided with the rear of a freight train at Stafford, writing-off the locomotive and killing two of the Royal Mail employees on board the train, John Thomson and Tommy Poynts.

On 16 October 2003, the Norton Bridge rail crash saw an intermodal train, hauled by nos. 86631 and 86611, collide with the rear of another stationary freight train. The force of the impact broke the leading locomotive in half, although the driver survived. 86631 was written off due to severe damage, while 86611 became a source of spares for Freightliner.

==Model railways==
In 1981, Hornby Railways launched its first version of the Class 86 in OO gauge in BR Blue, as 86219 &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Further examples, in a variety of liveries, have since been released. The Hornby model has since been superseded by a model from Heljan, which was introduced in 2010. However, this latter model had its faults and a retooled version depicting Classes 86/4 and 86/6 was announced in 2019. Further Class 86/2 models 
will then join the Heljan range in 2023.

In British N gauge, a model was made briefly by Lima as E3185 in Electric Blue livery; however, this model was too short and has not been available new for many years. A more accurate model is made by Dapol and is available in a variety of liveries. The Dapol model was introduced in 2010.

<doc id="978171" wikidata="Q1799932" url="?curid=978171" title="Ramrod">
<text>A ramrod (or scouring stick) is a metal or wooden device used with muzzleloading firearms to push the projectile up against the propellant (mainly blackpowder). The ramrod was used with weapons such as muskets and cannons and was usually held in a notch underneath the barrel. 

==Use in firearms==
Bullets that did not fit snugly in the barrel were often secured in place by a wad of paper or cloth, but either way, ramming was necessary to place the bullet securely at the rear of the barrel. Ramming was also needed to tamp the powder so that it would explode properly instead of fizzle (this was a leading cause of misfires).

In some pistols from the 17th century, the ramrod is folded up in a small compartment at the end of the pommel.

The ramrod could also be fitted with tools for various tasks such as cleaning the weapon, or retrieving a stuck bullet.

== Caplock revolvers ==
Cap and ball revolvers were loaded a bit like muzzleloaders—powder was poured into each chamber of the cylinder from the muzzle end, and a bullet was then squeezed in. Such handguns usually had a ramming mechanism built into the frame. The user pulled a lever underneath the barrel of the pistol, which pushed a rammer into the aligned chamber.

Caplock revolvers mostly had mechanical devices with ramrods mounted on the frame of the revolver, which rammed the ball into the chamber of the cylinder by pulling a lever that was connected to the ramrod in various ways (by hinge, screw or lever). These mechanisms are called rammers or loading-levers. The most popular rammers used in caplock revolvers were the Colt, Adams and Kerr systems.

=== Colt&#x27;s rammer ===

Colt&#x27;s rammer, patented by Samuel Colt about 1839, is a straight lever hinged under the barrel, with a triangular plate on its back end. The back corner of the triangle is hinged under the barrel, while the bottom corner is hinged to a short ramrod below and behind it. Pulling the lever down pushes the rod into the lowest chamber of the cylinder. This system was used on Colt revolvers from 1839 until 1873, when the Colt Peacemaker with metallic cartridges was introduced, as well as on Remington and Webley revolvers.

=== Adams rammer ===
Adams rammer, patented by Robert Adams in 1853, a straight or slightly downward-curving lever mounted on the left or right side of the frame with a screw at the front end and resting under the cylinder on the side of the stock when not in use. The lever pivots around a pin at the front end (on the frame of the revolver in front of and below the cylinder), and has a short ramrod in the middle, facing down in a fixed position. To use, the lever must be manually rotated down and forward for 270°, until the lever is in front of the cylinder and the rod enters one of the chambers, pressing the ball in. This mechanism was used on older Adams revolvers (on the left side of the revolver) and Webley Longspur revolvers (on the right side of the revolver).

=== Kerr&#x27;s rammer ===

Kerr rammer, patented by James Kerr in 1855, a bent lever (bent downwards at a right or obtuse angle, with a short ramrod on the lower arm) which pivots about a pin on the front of the revolver frame in front of the cylinder and rests on the left side of the barrel when not in use. The lever must be turned up 90° to push the rod into the chamber. This mechanism was used in the Beaumont-Adams and Tranter revolvers, as well as the newer Adams and Webley Longspur revolvers.

== Artillery ==
Naval artillery began as muzzle-loading cannon and these too required ramming. Large muzzle loading guns continued into the 1880s, using wooden staffs worked by several sailors as ramrods. Manual ramming was replaced with hydraulic powered ramming with trials on from 1874.

==Other uses==
 indicates the term is also a used to describe a trail or ranch foreman, particularly one on cattle drives. It is also used as a verb to describe spurring or forcing a thing, such as a piece of legislation, forward. Similar to v. “spearhead”.

<text>Nasmyth is a lunar impact crater located near the southwestern limb of the Moon. It is attached to the southeast rim of the flooded crater Wargentin, and the southern half is overlain by the larger Phocylides.

The rim of Nasmyth is worn and impacted in several locations by craterlets, most notably Nasmyth D which lies across the north rim. The floor has been flooded by lava flows in the past, making the surface relatively flat and the rim low. There is no central peak within the crater, but the floor is impacted by some small craterlets.

Nasmyth lies to the northwest of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nasmyth.

<text>The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is a regional planning agency incorporating various local governments in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. It encompasses nine counties surrounding the San Francisco Bay. Those counties are Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. It has the ability to establish housing and transportation goals for cities to minimize urban sprawl by requiring that housing be zoned for near new workplace construction. It deals with land use, housing, environmental quality, and economic development. Non-profit organizations as well as governmental organizations can be members. All nine counties and 101 cities within the Bay Area are voluntary members of ABAG.

As an advisory organization, ABAG has limited statutory authority. It is governed by its General Assembly, which consists of an elected official (delegate) from each city and county which is a member of the organization. The General Assembly determines policy, adopts the annual budget and work program, and reviews policy actions taken or proposed by the organization&#x27;s Executive Board. A majority of city and county votes are required for action.

The organization is associated with such agencies and projects as the San Francisco Bay Trail and the San Francisco Estuary Partnership.

ABAG works with other regional agencies, including the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), Bay Area Air Quality Management District, and San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, to promote sustainable development by working in partnership with city and county governments to establish both Priority Development Areas and Priority Conservation Areas. These local actions will, in turn, help achieve a more efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable region.

==History==
ABAG was formed in 1961. In 1970, it issued its Regional Plan, 1970-1990, the Bay Area&#x27;s first comprehensive regional plan. The document outlined a regional open space plan, regional information systems and technology support, criminal justice and training, water policy and waste collection, and earthquake hazards and planning.

ABAG, along with the MTC, worked together to develop and implement Plan Bay Area in 2013 as a transportation and land-use/housing strategy through 2040.

<text>Phocylides is a lunar impact crater located near the southwest rim of the Moon. It overlays the south rim of the crater Nasmyth to the north. To the northwest is the unusual plateau formation of Wargentin. Eastward is the merged formation Schiller, and in the southwest lies Pingré.

The outer wall of Phocylides is worn and eroded, especially along the western edge. The northern edge of the rim is notched and irregular, with a rise of ground joining the south rim of Wargentin. The crater Phocylides F lies across the southern rim. The floor of Phocylides is flooded and relatively smooth, with a few small craterlets and no central peak. The most notable impact on the floor is a crater near the northeast rim.

Phocylides lies to the northwest of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Phocylides.

<text>The national flag of India, colloquially called &quot;Tiraṅgā&quot; (the tricolour), is a horizontal rectangular tricolour flag, the colours being of India saffron, white and India green; with the , a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Union of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term &quot;tricolour&quot; almost always refers to the Indian national flag.

The current Indian flag was designed by Badruddin Tyabji based on the &quot;&quot; flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress adopted by Mahatma Gandhi after making significant modifications to the design proposed by Pingali Venkayya. This flag included the &quot;charkha&quot; which was replaced with the &quot;chakra&quot; in 1947 by Tyabji.

Before the amendment of the flag code in 2021, the flag was by law only to be made of &quot;&quot;; a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, which allocates it to regional groups. As of 2023, there are four units in India that are licensed to manufacture the flag.

Usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.

== History ==
=== Pre-independence movement ===
A number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian independence movement by the rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag, whose design was based on western heraldic standards, was similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and South Africa; its red field included the Union Jack in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed &quot;Indianness&quot;, Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.

In the early twentieth century, around the coronation of Edward VII, a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the realm was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or &quot;Gau Mata&quot; (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India&#x27;s Muslim population.

=== Early tricolour development ===
In Europe, in 1579, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, which established the independence of the Dutch Republic from the Spanish Empire, newly formed Netherlands adopted the first tricolour in the world, known as Prinsenvlag, an orange-white-blue flag. This flag symbolised independence. During the French Revolution, in 1790, Le Tricolore, a blue, white and red flag was adopted to symbolise republicanism (overthrow of monarchy). The flag of the Netherlands inspired the flag of France, which in turn inspired many further tricolour flags in countries around the world. Every country took to its own choice of colors to be represented in their tricolours.

The partition of Bengal (1905) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country.

The &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; flag, part of the nationalist Swadeshi movement, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.

Around the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906. Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.

In 1909, Lord Ampthill, former Governor of the Madras Presidency, wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; of London in the run-up to Empire Day pointing out that there existed &quot;no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province... Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire.&quot;
In 1916, Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.

In the early 1920s, national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the League of Nations wanted to use an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.

=== Gandhi&#x27;s activism ===

In April 1921, Mahatma Gandhi wrote in his journal &quot;Young India&quot; about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the &quot;charkha&quot; or spinning wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.

On 13 April 1923, during a procession by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, on the first of May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the &quot;Flag Satyagraha&quot;, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The &quot;satyagraha&quot;, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the &quot;Swarajists&quot;, called it inconsequential.

Finally, at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July 1923, at the insistence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu, Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed. The flag movement was managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people. By the end of the movement, over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India. &quot;The Bombay Chronicle&quot; reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers, students, merchants, labourers and &quot;national servants&quot;. While Muslim participation was moderate, the movement enthused women, who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement.

While the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi&#x27;s writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.

Detractors of the flag movement, including Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag as a symbol of national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use of the flag, and based on directives from London, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag. The &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.

=== Final adoption ===
A few months before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed. To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C. Rajagopalachari, K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members.

On 14 July 1947, the committee recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones. The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot; from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the &quot;chakra&quot; was chosen as it was representative of &quot;dharma&quot; and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.

The flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka Chakra in blue in the centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously. It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.

=== Specifications ===
According to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2. All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized. The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly spaced spokes.

The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the flag code, but in section 4.3.1 of &quot;IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag&quot;, there is a chart that describes specific sizes of the flag and the chakra (reproduced alongside).

=== Construction Sheets ===
=== Colours ===
Both the Flag code and IS1 call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue. Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of navy blue, from &quot;IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag&quot; as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C. The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803–1973.

The values given in the table correspond to CIE 1931 colour space. Approximate RGB values for use may be taken to be: India saffron #FF671F, white #FFFFFF, India green #046A38, navy blue #06038D. Pantone values closest to this are 165 C, White, 2258 C and 2735 C.

== Symbolism ==

The current Indian flag with Ashok Chakra was designed by Badruddin Tyabji in 1947. Gandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The precursor to current flag , The swaraj flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi&#x27;s goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing, between a red stripe for Hindus and a green stripe for Muslims. The design was then modified to replace red with saffron and to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities (as well to symbolise peace between the communities) and provide a background for the spinning wheel. However, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, the three bands were later reassigned new meanings: courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.

A few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947, the specially constituted Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities. A modified version of the &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the spinning wheel was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law. The philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later became India&#x27;s first vice president and second president, clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:

== Protocol ==
Display and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code – India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honor Act, 1971. Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.

Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water or be used as a drapery in any form. The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.

The flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.

The original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated, and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.

At the end of the appeals process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal&#x27;s favour, asking the Government of India to consider the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.

The original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms, costumes and other clothing. In July 2005, the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage. The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments, and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases, handkerchiefs or other dress material.

Disposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.

=== Display ===

The rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other, and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.

Whenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers&#x27; left), as this is the position of authority. So, when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker&#x27;s right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.
The flag, when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.
The privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President, the Vice President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.

The flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President, the Vice President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.

When the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag, and to the right (observer&#x27;s left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.

When the Indian flag is displayed with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India should be in the middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag&#x27;s breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.

=== Half-mast ===
The flag should be flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. The decision to do so lies with the president of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.

The flag is flown half-mast nationwide on the death of the president, vice president or prime minister. It is flown half-mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Union Ministers. On deaths of governors, lieutenant governors and chief ministers, the flag is flown at half-mast in the respective states and union territories.

The Indian flag cannot be flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), Gandhi Jayanti (2 October), or state formation anniversaries, except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast when the body is moved from the building.

Observances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half-mast.

On occasions of state, military, central para-military forces funerals, the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre.

=== Manufacturing process ===

The design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton. The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008. Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law.

In 1951, after India became a republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) brought out the first official specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 to conform to the metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968. The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.

Until 2021, khadi, a hand-spun cloth, was the only material allowed to be used for the flag, and flying a flag made of any other material was punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine (although this was rarely enforced). Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill. The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre, four threads per stitch, and one square foot should weigh exactly .

The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of northern Karnataka. , there are four BIS flag production and supply units; namely Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha based in Hubli, Khadi Dyers &amp; Printers (also known as Kore Gramodyog Kendra) based in Borivali, KDP Enterprises based in Vasai, and the Madhya Bharat Khadi Sangh based in Gwalior. The unit in Gwalior in particular has a laboratory for testing the standard of the Khadi cloth used for making the flags.

Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines.
 The hand-woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at Garag, a small village in the Dharwad district. A Centre was established at Garag in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk Kshetriya Seva Sangh and obtained the centre&#x27;s licence to make flags.

Once woven, the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, the material, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.

In December 2021 the Government of India amended the flag code to allow machine manufacturing of flags as well as the use of alternative materials including polyester, non-khadi cotton or silk.

<text>Nöggerath is a relatively small lunar impact crater in the southwest section of the Moon. It is located to the northwest of Phocylides, and is pointed toward by the northern elongation of Schiller. Nöggerath is a relatively unremarkable crater, with a smooth floor and a rim that is only slightly eroded and impacted at the southern edge.

Nöggerath lies north of the Schiller-Zucchius Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nöggerath.

<text> is the provisional designation of an object seen orbiting Saturn just beyond the outer strand of the F ring on June 21, 2004. It was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Science Team in images taken by the Cassini–Huygens probe on June 21, 2004 and announced on September 9, 2004.
Despite later attempts to recover it, it has not been reliably sighted since. Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15, 2004 failed to recover the object. The sequence should have been easily capable of detecting a moon of similar size, suggesting it to simply be a transient clump. An approximate linkage could be made of S/2004 S 3 to S/2004 S 4, and matched to two other detected clumps on other dates, but considering its non-detection in November, their relation is probably coincidental.

Another object, , was sighted nearby 5 hours later, but this time just &quot;inside&quot; the F Ring. Because of the differing localisation the second object was given a fresh designation, although their interpretation as a single object on a F-ring crossing orbit is also possible. Such an object might also be orbiting at a slightly different inclination to the F ring, thereby not actually passing through the ring material despite being seen both radially inward and outward of it.

If a solid object after all, would be 3–5 km in diameter based on brightness, and might be a shepherd satellite for the outer edge of Saturn&#x27;s F ring.

<text>Rocky road ice cream is a chocolate-flavored ice cream. Though there are variations from the original flavor, it traditionally comprises chocolate ice cream, nuts, and whole or diced marshmallows. 

== History ==
According to one source, the flavor was created in March 1929 by William Dreyer in Oakland, California when he cut up walnuts and marshmallows with his wife&#x27;s sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream in a manner that reflected how his partner Joseph Edy&#x27;s chocolate candy creation incorporated walnuts and marshmallow pieces. Later, the walnuts would be replaced by pieces of toasted almond. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dreyer and Edy gave the flavor its current name &quot;to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression.&quot; Alternatively, Fentons Creamery in Oakland claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road-style ice cream flavor invented by his friend, Fentons&#x27; George Farren, who blended his own Rocky Road-style candy bar into ice cream; however, Dreyer substituted almonds for walnuts.

The original Rocky Road ice cream used chocolate ice cream with no chocolate chip pieces. By blending numerous ingredients such as chocolate ice cream, nuts, and marshmallows, the rocky road flavor was one of the first types to mix in the materials together. This style was developed by Dreyer&#x27;s lead chemical engineer and dairy chef Noah Holladay and proved difficult to produce due to the nature of freezing and preserving various mixed ingredients. Over the years after the inception of the flavor, many companies would try to imitate or mix in other ingredients such as various nuts, fruits, and toppings, but the original combination proved to be the most popular. Some variations, such as the Breyers brand version, contain a “marshmallow swirl” as opposed to regular marshmallows.

<text>Don Máximo Macapobre was a 19th-century Philippines leader and activist, one of the founders of New Hinulawan (1863–1869), now part of Toledo, Cebu, in the Philippines. Little is known about his life except for stories handed down to his scions still living in Bato. His nickname was Kapitan Imok. He often denounced the abuses of the &quot;guardia civil&quot; (the police) and the oppression brought upon by tax collectors. He defied the Spanish Empire authorities by refusing to be drafted in the military service.

==Early life==
He was born in Valencia, Carcar, Cebu as Máximo Tanudtanod. Imok&#x27;s father was Amadeo. Concerned for the safety of his son, he sneaked Imok to Bato. To hide their identities, they changed their family name from Tanudtanod to Macapobre. In Bato, Imok settled for good and married a beautiful lass, a certain lady named Sumilhig, with whom he begot eight children, namely: Ángel, Victorina, Potenciana, Regino, María, Severino, Baldomero, and the other one whose name are lost to history.

As a resident of Bato (formerly known as Batohanon) and having a family of his own, Captain Imok, as he was now called by the people of his barangay (district) showed his concern for the welfare of his community and for the quality of life for his people.

He was an ordinary man, Imok possessed an extraordinary desire to provide for his family a green pasture which served as his inspiration to work hard. He was able to own and operate an &quot;intosan&quot; - the old system of milling sugar cane to produce sugar which was constructed in sitio Tipoo, Bato. The sugar was then sold in Hinulawan, the old name of Toledo.

In Hinulawan, he was invited to a council composed of other leaders in the area, to establish the new town. The new town and its present location is called Toledo upon suggestion of the &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; of Cebu whose place of origin was Toledo, Spain.

<doc id="978266" wikidata="Q5600920" url="?curid=978266" title="Greater trochanter">
<text>The greater trochanter of the femur is a large, irregular, quadrilateral eminence and a part of the skeletal system.

It is directed lateral and medially and slightly posterior. In the adult it is about 2–4 cm lower than the femoral head. Because the pelvic outlet in the female is larger than in the male, there is a greater distance between the greater trochanters in the female.

It has two surfaces and four borders. It is a traction epiphysis.

== Surfaces ==

The &quot;lateral surface&quot;, quadrilateral in form, is broad, rough, convex, and marked by a diagonal impression, which extends from the postero-superior to the antero-inferior angle, and serves for the insertion of the tendon of the gluteus medius.

Above the impression is a triangular surface, sometimes rough for part of the tendon of the same muscle, sometimes smooth for the interposition of a bursa between the tendon and the bone. Below and behind the diagonal impression is a smooth triangular surface, over which the tendon of the gluteus maximus lies, a bursa being interposed.

The &quot;medial surface&quot;, of much less extent than the lateral, presents at its base a deep depression, the trochanteric fossa (digital fossa), for the insertion of the tendon of the obturator externus, and above and in front of this an impression for the insertion of the obturator internus and superior and inferior gemellus muscles.

== Borders ==

The &quot;superior border&quot; is free; it is thick and irregular, and marked near the center by an impression for the insertion of the piriformis.

The &quot;inferior border&quot; corresponds to the line of junction of the base of the trochanter with the lateral surface of the body; it is marked by a rough, prominent, slightly curved ridge, which gives origin to the upper part of the vastus lateralis.

The &quot;anterior border&quot; is prominent and somewhat irregular; it affords insertion at its lateral part to the gluteus minimus.

The &quot;posterior border&quot; is very prominent and appears as a free, rounded edge, which bounds the back part of the trochanteric fossa.

Birmingham was born in Liverpool, United Kingdom, but grew up in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia, having moved to the country with his parents in 1970. Birmingham received his higher education at St Edmund&#x27;s College in Ipswich and at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Birmingham&#x27;s only stint of full-time employment was as a researcher at the Australian Department of Defence but he has worked for the television program &quot;A Current Affair&quot;.

==Career==
Birmingham returned to Queensland to study law but he did not complete his legal studies, choosing instead to pursue a career as an author. Birmingham has a degree in international relations and currently lives in Brisbane.

===Writing===
Birmingham was first published in &quot;Semper Floreat&quot;, the student newspaper at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, writing a series of stories featuring a fictional character named Commander Harrison Biscuit. His first paid published work appeared in a student magazine at the University of Queensland. He won a young writers award for the Independent, which was edited by Brian Toohey and wrote a number of articles for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Australian &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines.

In 1994, Birmingham released his sharehouse living memoir &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot;, which has since been turned into a play, film, and a graphic novel. The sequel is &quot;The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco&quot; (Duffy and Snellgrove, 1997), the theatrical version of which was written and produced by 36 unemployed actors. In 2011 it was the longest running stage play in Australian history. In 2014, three Brisbane filmmakers sought funds to make a film version via crowdfunding.

His other works include &quot;The Search for Savage Henry&quot;, a crime novel featuring the character Harrison Biscuit, &quot;How To Be A Man&quot;, a semi-humorous guide to contemporary Australian masculinity and &quot;Off One&#x27;s Tits&quot;, a collection of essays and articles previously published elsewhere. He also spent four years researching the history of Sydney for &quot;Leviathan: the unauthorised biography of Sydney&quot; (Random House, 1999, ). It won Australia&#x27;s National Prize For Non-Fiction in 2002. In 2010, the Sydney Theatre Company created a play based upon the non-fiction book &quot;Leviathan&quot; that focus on the dark side of the evolution of the city of Sydney.

He has also written two small pocket books &quot;The Felafel Guide to Getting Wasted&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Felafel Guide to Sex&quot; (2002) which feature advice Birmingham has received over the years regarding those two subjects. He also wrote the nonfiction book &quot;Dopeland : taking the high road through Australia&#x27;s marijuana culture&quot; (2003).

Birmingham has written two &quot;Quarterly Essays&quot; (Black Inc. an imprint of Schwartz Publishing Pty Ltd) &quot;Appeasing Jakarta: Australia&#x27;s Complicity in the East Timor Tragedy&quot; and &quot;A Time for War: Australia as a Military Power&quot;. He is also a regular contributor to &quot;The Monthly&quot;, an Australian national magazine of politics, society and the arts.

In September 2006, Birmingham wrote a piece in &quot;The Australian&quot; lambasting Germaine Greer for an article she had written in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about Steve Irwin shortly after his death. He described Greer&#x27;s comments as &quot;a poisonous discharge of bile&quot;. Portions of Birmingham&#x27;s article were later quoted in the Parliament of New South Wales.

In 2015, Birmingham parted ways with the traditional tradebook publishing business by becoming his own publisher after his Australian publisher&#x27;s decision to release his Dave Hooper series several months prior to the release of the same books in the much larger North American and European markets instead of the near simultaneous global release that was used for the release his previous works. The result of his Australian publisher&#x27;s poor business decision resulted in dismal sales in those larger book markets caused by the demand being filled through pirated electronic editions due to lack of availability through normal channels such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. Using the new publishing model, Birmingham has published three Stalin&#x27;s Hammer novellas plus a new novel called &quot;A Girl in Time&quot;.

===&quot;Axis of Time&quot;===
In 2004 he published the alternative history &quot;Weapons of Choice&quot;, the first in the Axis of Time trilogy, a series of Tom Clancy-like techno-thrillers. Many writers from those genres appear as minor characters. It was published by Del Rey Books in the United States, and by Pan Macmillan in Australia.

The series tells of a multinational peacekeeping force from the early 21st century being taken back in time to 1942, where its presence completely changes the course of World War II. In August 2005, the second book, &quot;Designated Targets&quot; was published in Australia. Publication in the United States followed in October 2005.

The third and final full-length novel in the trilogy, &quot;Final Impact&quot;, was released in Australia in early August 2006, and was released in the United States in January 2007. The ABC reported in 2006 that there were two new Birmoverse books in the works, one set shortly after the end of the war, and another in the alternative 1980s, said to feature a dashing young RAF pilot: Richard Branson. One of these books was originally set to be released in Australia in 2008, but Birmingham instead wrote &quot;Without Warning&quot;.

In 2013 the series got a new lease on live with the novella Stalin&#x27;s Hammer: Rome. This was followed in 2016 by Stalin&#x27;s Hammer: Cairo and Paris. The three novela&#x27;s were published in print as Stalin&#x27;s Hammer: The Complete Sequence a year later. 
The storyline takes the reader to an alternate 1954, ten years after the ending of the first series.

In 2023 &quot;World War 3.1&quot; saw the light of day. Continuing the story from Stalin&#x27;s Hammer, it describes the start of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe.

===&quot;Disappearance&quot; series===
&quot;Without Warning&quot;, the first book in a new universe, was released in Australia in September 2008. The novel is a thought experiment, set on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. It deals with the disappearance of the bulk of the United States&#x27; population as the result of a large energy field that becomes known as &quot;The Wave&quot;. &quot;Without Warning&quot; deals with the international consequences of the disappearance of the world&#x27;s only super power on the eve of war. It was released in the United States on 3 February 2009. A second novel, titled &quot;After America&quot;, was released on 1 July 2010 in Australia and 17 August 2010 in the United States.
The third book in the series, &quot;Angels of Vengeance&quot;, was released on 1 November 2011 in Australia and was released in April 2012 in the United States.

===&quot;The Cruel Stars&quot; trilogy===
A space opera series. The first book, &quot;The Cruel Stars&quot;, was published in 2019. The second, &quot;The Shattered Skies&quot;, was published in 2022. The third book in the trilogy, &quot;The Forever Dead&quot;, was originally scheduled for a 2024 publication, but it appears that its release has been delayed again.

==Literary significance and reception==
Kirkus Reviews gave a very positive review for &quot;The Cruel Stars&quot; and called it &quot;Frenetic action viewed in a black fun-house mirror&quot; for its narrative that &quot;canters along at a good clip, dashing off insane cannibals, exploding warships, detached heads, and cartwheeling body parts, with occasional transfusions of dark comic relief.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;FanFiAd&quot; was &quot;kind of stuck for words at how much I enjoyed this one&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;Book Page&quot; wrote &quot;A good space opera can be many things. It can be funny or deeply philosophical. It can be touching, and it can be gory. John Birmingham’s latest novel, &quot;The Cruel Stars&quot;, balances all of those things, making readers laugh out loud even as it pulls them through an intergalactic battle for the soul of humanity.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;At Boundary&#x27;s Edge&quot; compared this work to Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ryanverse.

A reviewer for Space.com wrote about &quot;The Shattered Skies&quot; calling the book &quot;military sci-fi at its finest&quot;. Writing for &quot;FanFiAddict&quot;, its reviewer called &quot;The Cruel Stars&quot; series utterly fantastic and wrote &quot;Birmingham really finds new ways to keep the plot fresh and explore different, strange scenarios despite the crew being on a ship in the void that is space.&quot; Another reviewer wrote that the book has &quot;absorbing conflicts with high stakes and believable antagonists, complex characters with rich relationships and effective emotional depth, and Birmingham’s magnificent world building&quot; while avoiding the flaws in the first book of the series.

==Awards==
&quot;Designated Targets&quot; was a finalist for the 2005 Aurealis Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

&quot;The Shattered Skies&quot; was nominated for a Dragon Award for the 2022 Best Military Science Fiction or Fantasy Novel.

<doc id="978280" wikidata="Q2979364" url="?curid=978280" title="Clinton Walker">
<text>Clinton Walker is an Australian writer, best known for his works on popular music. He wrote the books &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (1994; a biography of Bon Scott), &quot;Buried Country&quot; (2000), &quot;History is Made at Night&quot; (2012), and others. He has also written on other subjects, in books such as &quot;Football Life&quot; (1998) and &quot;Golden Miles&quot; (2005), and has worked as a journalist.

==Early life==
Born in Bendigo, Victoria, in 1957, Walker dropped out of art school in Brisbane in the late 70s to start a punk fanzine with Andrew McMillan and to write for student newspapers.

==Career==
In 1978, Walker moved to Melbourne, where he worked on-air for 3RRR, and with Bruce Milne on the fanzine &quot;Pulp&quot; and wrote for the fledgling &quot;Roadrunner&quot; magazine.

Moving on to Sydney in 1980, he commenced a career as a freelance journalist, and for many years he wrote for numerous magazines and newspapers, including &quot;RAM&quot; and Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, as well as &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;New Woman&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, and &quot;Juice&quot;.

===Books===
Walker published his first book, &quot;Inner City Sound&quot;, in 1981. It documented the emergence of independent Australian punk/post-punk music and quickly fell out of print but was re-released in 2005 in an expanded, updated edition, along with an accompanying CD anthology.

In 1984, after a couple of years in London, Walker returned to Australia and published his second book, &quot;The Next Thing&quot;.

Walker&#x27;s third book, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, was a biography of Bon Scott (1994).

Walker then published (1996) and &quot;Football Life&quot; (1998). &quot;Stranded&quot; was republished in 2021 by the Visible Spectrum in a new updated global edition. Des Cowley in his review in &quot;Rhythms Magazine&quot; said: &quot;Reading &quot;Stranded&quot; today with a quarter-century’s hindsight, it’s easy to see that Walker mostly got things right. And if he stumbled now and again, it’s still the case he was streaks ahead of the pack.&quot; &quot;Football Life&quot; was similarly a personal history but covered minor-league Australian Rules culture.

Walker&#x27;s sixth book, &quot;Buried Country&quot;, a history of Aboriginal country music, was published in 2000, along with an accompanying documentary film and CD soundtrack album. A new updated edition of the book was released in 2015 along with a rebooted version of the CD called &quot;Buried Country 1.5&quot;, which received further critical praise. A live stageshow adaptation premiered in 2016 and toured for several years in the festival circuit. In 2018, Australian singer-songwriter Darren Hanlon, in conjunction with Mississippi Records in the US, produced a vinyl iteration of the &quot;Buried Country&quot; compilation that included new tracks.

In 2005, Walker’s seventh book, &quot;Golden Miles: Sex, Speed and the Australian Muscle Car&quot;, was published, expanding on an article he published in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in 2002. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the book&#x27;s design and called Walker &quot;our best chronicler of Australian grassroots culture&quot;. It was re-released in 2009 in an expanded and updated edition by Wakefield Press.

In 2012, Walker published &quot;History is Made at Night&quot; about the Australian live music circuit. In 2013 he published his ninth book, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, about the ill-starred Australian speed ace from the 1920s, Norman &#x27;Wizard&#x27; Smith, as well as co-producing the CD &quot;Silver Roads&quot;, an anthology of Australian country-rock from the 1970s.

&quot;Deadly Woman Blues&quot;, a graphic history of black women in Australian music, was released in 2018 by a division of academic publisher UNSW Press. Each of 99 biographical entries was accompanied by a hand-drawn illustration by Walker. The book immediately garnered a few glowing reviews. There was an angry backlash from four of the artists who expressed their displeasure at being included without being spoken to, and citing factual inaccuracies. This led to social media outrage in which Walker was criticized as a racist, misogynist, colonialist privileged white male. The book was withdrawn from sale, with the publisher promising to pulp any unsold copies and never to reprint it. Walker admitted to mistakes and apologised, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to obscure what I was doing, I didn&#x27;t take all the appropriate steps. I&#x27;ve been involved in underclass music forever, and in some ways, this is no different, but in other ways, it is very different&quot;.

In 2021, Walker released two books, including a new edition of &quot;Stranded&quot; and a new work, &quot;Suburban Songbook&quot;. &quot;Suburban Songbook: Writing Hits in post-war/pre-Countdown Australia&quot; is a critical history of the early evolution of rock/pop songwriting in Australia.

Walker&#x27;s twelfth book &quot;The Soundtrack from Saturday Night Fever&quot; was published in 2023 as part of Bloomsbury&#x27;s 33 1/3 series of short books on albums.

==Legacy==
Frederator Studios has persisted in the tradition of surfacing new talent, characters, and series in several ways, with &quot;The Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; being the first to present short cartoons recently produced by independent filmmakers around the world. This tradition has continued online with their Channel Frederator network, the world&#x27;s largest animation network, with over 3000 members who produce and program their own YouTube animation channels. Some of the most notable entries include &quot;To a Man with a Big Nose&quot;, &quot;Bathtime in Clerkenwell&quot;, &quot;Kiwi!&quot;, &quot;Kenya&quot; and &quot;Magical Trevor&quot;, the &quot;Ape Escape&quot; trilogy of shorts, &quot;The Naive from Loli Land&quot;, &quot;Charlie &amp; Chunk&quot;, &quot;The Mouschist&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bert&quot;, &quot;Engrish Bwudd&quot;, &quot;Skippy&quot;, &quot;Monster on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Pigly&quot;, &quot;Libraryhead&quot;, &quot;Over the Moon&quot;, &quot;Feb-18-05&quot;, &quot;Timmy&#x27;s Lessons In Nature&quot;, &quot;Farm Force&quot;, &quot;Late Night Comedy&quot;, &quot;Zoologic&quot;, &quot;Maestro&quot;, &quot;Zoya the Zebra&quot;, &quot;PGi-13&quot;, &quot;The Tale of How&quot;, &quot;Loco Melones&quot;, &quot;Rockfish&quot;, &quot;Super Scout&quot; and &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;. Certain shorts featured here were produced by Nelvana, and those were also shown on YTV&#x27;s &quot;Funpak&quot;, such as &quot;The Not-So-Superheroic Adventures of Sidekick&quot;, which spawned &quot;Sidekick&quot;. 

&quot;To a Man with a Big Nose&quot; was selected for the 2006 Fargo Film Festival in addition to being a Nicktoons Film Festival entry, &quot;Bathtime in Clerkenwell&quot; won three awards in 2004 including one category from Sundance, &quot;Kiwi!&quot; and both weebl&#x27;s &quot;Kenya&quot; and &quot;Magical Trevor&quot; were considered major internet memes at that time, &quot;The Mouschist&quot; was created by &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot; creator John R. Dilworth, the &quot;Ape Escape&quot; trilogy of shorts promoted the game series exclusively for Sony&#x27;s own PlayStation 2 at the time (and had eventually aired its own series on Nicktoons five years later), and the four were precursor shorts—&quot;Super Scout&quot;, &quot;The Naive from Loli Land&quot;, &quot;Hero: 108&quot; and &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;—would eventually become precursor to Nickelodeon&#x27;s own &quot;The Mighty B!&quot; and Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Regular Show&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as the latter&#x27;s failed pilot of the same name. &quot;Nicktoons Film Festival&quot; (or &quot;Nicktoons Network Animation Festival&quot;) Grand Jury judges included Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;), John Kricfalusi (creator of &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;), voice actor Patrick Warburton, Bill Plympton (filmmaker behind &quot;Your Face&quot; and &quot;Guard Dog&quot;), veteran Disney animator Eric Goldberg, Mike Judge (creator of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;), David X. Cohen (writer, producer and showrunner for &quot;Futurama&quot;), Don Hertzfeldt (of &quot;Rejected&quot; fame), Chris Prynoski (founder of Titmouse, Inc.), Seth MacFarlane (creator of &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;American Dad!&quot;), comedian and actor Marlon Wayans (in promotion for &quot;Thugaboo&quot; also on Nicktoons Network) and Steve Oedekerk (creator of &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; and &quot;Barnyard&quot;). Eric Fogel, who created &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; and &quot;Glenn Martin DDS&quot; for MTV and Nick at Nite, respectively, also created &quot;Charlie &amp; Chunk&quot; exclusively for the show.

Simultaneously, Frederator has produced 250 original short cartoon films with several cartoon shorts &quot;incubators,&quot; including (as of 2016): &quot;What A Cartoon!&quot; (Cartoon Network, 1995), &quot;Oh Yeah! Cartoons&quot; (Nickelodeon, 1998), &quot;The Meth Minute 39&quot; (Channel Frederator, 2008), &quot;Random! Cartoons&quot; (Nickelodeon/Nicktoons, 2008), &quot;Too Cool! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2012), and &quot;GO! Cartoons&quot; (Cartoon Hangover, 2016). These laboratories have spun off notable series like: &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;Cow &amp; Chicken&quot;, &quot;Courage the Cowardly Dog&quot;, &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot; (which was the basis for Fox&#x27;s own &quot;Family Guy&quot;), &quot;Kenny and the Chimp&quot; (which was the basis for &quot;&quot;), &quot;Grim &amp; Evil&quot; (which was split into &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot; and &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;), &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Teenage Robot&quot;, &quot;ChalkZone&quot;, &quot;Nite Fite&quot;, &quot;Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum&quot;, &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, &quot;Rocket Dog&quot;, and &quot;Bee and PuppyCat&quot;.

<text>Robb Stark, also known by his epithet The Young Wolf, is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its HBO television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, where he is portrayed by Richard Madden.

Introduced in &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Robb is the eldest son and heir of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and Lady Catelyn Stark. He subsequently appeared in Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (2000). After his father is executed on the order of King Joffrey Baratheon, Robb is crowned King in the North by his bannermen and wages a war against the Iron Throne. Robb&#x27;s subsequent betrayal and murder at an event known as the Red Wedding shocked both book readers and television audiences alike.

== Character ==
=== Description ===
At the beginning of &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Robb is 14 years of age (increased to 17 in the TV series). As the oldest legitimate son of Eddard Stark and his wife Catelyn, Robb is raised as the heir to the ancient House Stark of Winterfell, which holds dominion over the North, one of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Trained by Winterfell&#x27;s master-at-arms Ser Rodrik Cassel, Robb is a talented rider, swordsman, and lancer. He has five siblings: younger sisters Sansa and Arya, younger brothers Bran and Rickon, and a bastard half-brother Jon Snow. He is also a close friend to Eddard&#x27;s ward Theon Greyjoy. Robb is accompanied by his direwolf, Grey Wind. Like most of his siblings, Robb favors his mother&#x27;s House Tully features over that of House Stark. He is strong and fast with a stocky build, blue eyes and thick auburn hair.

=== Development, overview and reception===
James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; describes Robb as less eager to seek retaliation than his father Eddard but as more pragmatic. Poniewozik&#x27;s overview of the television version of Robb focuses on his role as a foil for Eddard:

Robb has risen to take his father&#x27;s place, as a lord of Winterfell and as a focal character in the show. We never saw what kind of warrior Ned was in the field, but in King&#x27;s Landing, he fought a straight-ahead battle, telegraphing his moves, and died for it. Robb, seeing the Lannisters&#x27; numbers, shows himself capable of feints and deceptions—albeit at the cost of 2,000 men and the guilt of having sent them on a suicide mission.

In the third novel, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, Robb is assassinated in an event called the Red Wedding, which was inspired by the Black Dinner and Glencoe Massacre from Scottish history. George Martin has said that he decided to kill Robb Stark because he wished to keep the story difficult to predict: &quot;I killed Ned because everybody thinks he&#x27;s the hero ... The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.&quot;

In their 2015 book, &quot;Game of Thrones and Business&quot;, Tim Phillips and Rebecca Claire agree: 
Richard Madden has received positive reviews for his role as Robb Stark in the TV series.

== Storylines ==
=== Novels ===
Robb is not a point of view (POV) character in the novels and is mostly a background character. His actions are mainly witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his brother Bran and mother Catelyn, as well as via memories of Jon Snow and Theon Greyjoy.

==== &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; ====
When his father departs for King&#x27;s Landing to serve as the Hand of the King for Robert Baratheon, Robb becomes acting Lord of Winterfell. Following his father&#x27;s arrest for presumed treason, he calls his banners and marches south with an assembled Northern army in attempt to free his father. Additionally, Robb seeks to relieve the besieged Riverlands, dominion of House Tully, which have fallen under attack by forces of House Lannister after his mother imprisoned Lord Tyrion Lannister for the suspected attempted murder of Bran Stark. 

To secure safe passage at the vital crossing of The Twins, Robb consents to marrying one of Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s daughters or granddaughters as negotiated by his mother. After crossing the river, he surprises and destroys the Lannister army besieging Riverrun, capturing Ser Jaime Lannister during the Battle of Whispering Wood. Upon hearing of his father&#x27;s execution on the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon, Robb is crowned the King in the North and King of the Trident by his bannermen.

==== &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; ====
Robb continues to win crushing victories against Lord Tywin Lannister&#x27;s armies, and earns the nickname &quot;The Young Wolf&quot; for his ferocity in battle. With the War of the Five Kings raging, he sends his mother to negotiate an alliance with King Renly Baratheon, but Renly is assassinated by his brother, King Stannis Baratheon with blood magic from the priestess Melisandre. Robb invades the Westerlands in order to strategically assist Stannis&#x27; campaign against the Iron Throne. He also sends Theon Greyjoy to Pyke to broker an alliance with Theon&#x27;s father Lord Balon Greyjoy, ruler of the Iron Islands. However, Balon declares himself king and decides to invade the North instead. Theon betrays Robb, seizing Winterfell by surprise. Theon is believed to have murdered Robb&#x27;s youngest siblings Bran and Rickon, though in reality they have escaped and gone into hiding.

==== &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; ====
During an assault in the Westerlands, Robb is wounded and learns of the apparent deaths of his brothers at the hands of his closest friend. Falling ill due to mourning and injury, he is cared for by Lady Jeyne Westerling and takes her maidenhood. To preserve Jeyne&#x27;s honor, Robb marries her, rescinding his previous marriage arrangement with House Frey, causing them to desert his army.

Following King Stannis&#x27; defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, Robb withdraws from the Westerlands and returns to Riverrun to attend the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. Robb learns that his mother has secretly released Jaime Lannister as an exchange for her daughter Sansa, who remains a hostage in King&#x27;s Landing. This leads to the mutiny of Lord Rickard Karstark, whose two sons were slain by Jaime, forcing Robb to execute Rickard and subsequently lose House Karstark&#x27;s support. With his army dwindling, Robb tries to repair the alliance with the Freys by bargaining his uncle Edmure Tully to marry Lady Roslin Frey. The Freys demand that Robb personally attend the wedding at The Twins as an apology.

Robb learns that King Balon Greyjoy has died and he decides to lead his army to retake the North immediately after the wedding is complete. He soon learns that his sister Sansa has been forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister. To prevent the Lannisters from claiming Winterfell through Sansa&#x27;s child by Tyrion, Robb, against the opposition of his mother, disinherits Sansa and signs a decree legitimizing his bastard half-brother Jon Snow as his heir if he happens to die with no children, and requests the Night&#x27;s Watch release Jon from service. Robb then entrusts the decree to Lord Galbart Glover and Lady Maege Mormont, sending them to make contact with Lord Howland Reed so that he can launch a coordinated attack to recapture the strategically crucial Moat Cailin.

At The Twins, the Northern convoy, who are treated with bread and salt (thus promised guest rights and safety), are betrayed and massacred by House Frey and House Bolton during the wedding feast in an event orchestrated by Tywin Lannister, the Red Wedding. Robb is shot by crossbow bolts multiple times, and then personally murdered by his chief vassal Lord Roose Bolton, who has secretly defected in exchange for House Bolton gaining dominion over the North from House Stark. After his death, the Freys mutilate Robb&#x27;s body by sewing the head of his dead direwolf Grey Wind onto his decapitated corpse. His mother, as well as his entire army (save for the Boltons and Freys, a few soldiers who managed to escape), are also murdered.

=== Television adaptation ===
Robb Stark is portrayed by Richard Madden in the television adaption of the series. There are some slight differences between Robb&#x27;s TV portrayal and the book version. Robb&#x27;s age is changed from age 14 to age 17 at the start of the series. Instead of marrying Jeyne Westerling, he marries a healer from Volantis named Talisa Maegyr. Robb is not a POV character in the books, but he is given a much larger role in the TV series.

James Poniewozik comments in &quot;TIME&quot;, on Madden&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Pointy End&quot;: &quot;both the script and Richard Madden show in deft, quick strokes how the crisis focuses him. (This is another case where having a live actor does a better job of showing a transition that seemed more abrupt in the book.)&quot;

Madden said that he learned that the character would be killed off early on but otherwise read the books season by season, focusing primarily on the scripts: &quot;I&#x27;m, as an actor, forced to bend the path I put Robb on and change it and keep the surprises coming. Hopefully, I managed to do that.&quot;

==== Season 1 ====
Robb is the eldest son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn. When King Robert Baratheon summons Eddard to King&#x27;s Landing to serve as Hand of the King, Robb becomes acting Lord of Winterfell. After his father is arrested for apparent treason, Robb summons the Northern bannermen and assembles an army of 20,000 in an effort to rescue his father and aid the Riverlands, which have come under attack by the armies of House Lannister. Catelyn brokers an alliance between the North and House Frey when Robb consents to marrying one of Lord Walder Frey&#x27;s daughters, allowing the Stark army to strategically cross the river at the Twins and launch a surprise engagement against the Lannisters, successfully capturing Ser Jaime Lannister in the process. After the death of King Robert and the execution of Eddard Stark on the orders of King Joffrey Baratheon, a bastard born of incest between Jaime and Cersei Lannister, the Northern and Riverland lords declare their independence from the Iron Throne and proclaim Robb as the King in the North.

==== Season 2 ====
Robb proves to be a skillful military commander and he wins a succession of battles against Lord Tywin Lannister&#x27;s forces, earning him the nickname &quot;The Young Wolf&quot;. He sends his closest friend, Lord Theon Greyjoy, to the Iron Islands to broker an alliance with Lord Balon Greyjoy, Theon&#x27;s father. In exchange for Greyjoy support and the use of their naval fleet, Robb intends to recognize the Iron Islands&#x27; independence. Robb also sends his mother to parlay with Renly Baratheon, who has declared himself king and has amassed an army of 100,000. However, Stannis Baratheon, having also declared himself king via the lawful line of succession, prepares to engage Renly. Catelyn is successful in brokering an alliance with Renly, but he is assassinated by Stannis&#x27; using blood magic. Theon fails to convince his father to ally with Robb, and instead Balon declares himself a king and launches an invasion of the North. Theon decides to capture Winterfell to earn his father&#x27;s favor. Robb offers amnesty to the Ironborn invaders on the condition that they hand over Theon. Robb soon meets and falls in love with Talisa Maegyr, a foreign healer from Volantis.

Stannis assaults King&#x27;s Landing at the Battle of Blackwater Bay and is defeated when Tywin, joined by the armies of House Tyrell via a newly brokered alliance, arrives and stops the city from being sacked. While Robb travels to the Crag to negotiate a surrender, Jaime escapes and kills the son of Lord Rickard Karstark before he is recaptured. Catelyn stops Rickard from killing Jaime but discontent within the Stark army begins to grow. Additionally, despite his mother&#x27;s protest, Robb breaks his engagement with the Freys and marries Talisa. As a result, the Freys abandon the Stark army.

==== Season 3 ====
Believing Jaime to be her only chance of seeing her daughters again, Catelyn frees him and commands Brienne of Tarth to bring him to King&#x27;s Landing in exchange for Sansa Stark. Furious, Robb has his mother imprisoned. He leads his army to capture Harrenhal, but finds that hundreds of his imprisoned bannermen have been slaughtered. Upon learning of the death of his grandfather, Lord Hoster Tully, Robb returns to Riverrun for the funeral. Robb&#x27;s uncle and the new Lord of Riverrun, Edmure Tully, is scolded by Robb for previously disobeying a command when he attacked Ser Gregor Clegane&#x27;s forces. While at Riverrun, Robb executes Rickard Karstark after he murders two teenage Lannister squires. As a result, the Karstarks abandon his army. In order to regain an alliance with the Freys and bolster his army, Robb arranges for the reluctant Edmure to marry one of Walder Frey&#x27;s daughters. With the advisement of his mother, Robb prepares to invade Casterly Rock, the domain of House Lannister.

At the Twins, Walder Frey provides guest right to Robb, his family and bannermen. The wedding commences but Walder betrays Robb in an event secretly orchestrated by Tywin Lannister, Walder, and Lord Roose Bolton. Talisa, pregnant with Robb&#x27;s child, is stabbed in the stomach and killed. Robb&#x27;s entire army (save for the Boltons and Freys), are murdered. Robb himself is shot with multiple crossbow bolts, taunted by Walder, and subsequently executed by Roose with a knife to the heart. Catelyn kills Walder&#x27;s wife but she too is executed when her throat is slit. Robb&#x27;s corpse is decapitated and his direwolf Grey Wind&#x27;s head is sewn on in its place, and the corpse is then paraded around as the Stark forces are slaughtered. Robb&#x27;s great-uncle, Ser Brynden Tully escapes, but Edmure is held captive and Walder becomes Lord of Riverrun. Roose once again swears fealty to the Iron Throne and is granted the title of the Warden of the North. This event comes to be known as the Red Wedding.

==== Legacy ====
House Lannister strips House Stark of all lands and titles after Robb&#x27;s failed rebellion against the Iron Throne. The Boltons recapture Winterfell from Theon, expel the Ironborn from the North, and begin to rule with an iron fist. Sansa is forced to marry Roose&#x27;s legitimized bastard, Lord Ramsay Bolton. Tywin and Roose are later both killed by their own sons. The remnants of Robb&#x27;s army, now led by Brynden Tully, recapture Riverrun and hold it until Jaime Lannister retakes it and Brynden is killed. Years later, Arya Stark returns to Westeros, murders Walder Frey and his sons, and poisons all of his male descendants, ultimately exterminating House Frey. Sansa escapes from the Boltons and she and Jon Snow successfully destroy House Bolton and retake Winterfell. Jon is crowned the King in the North, restoring Stark rule in the process. With the arrival of Queen Daenerys Targaryen, Jon declares fealty and becomes Warden of the North. However, following her death and Jon&#x27;s banishment, the North is given permission by the newly appointed King Bran Stark to regain its independence, and the Northern lords declare Sansa the Queen in the North.

==In other media==
In his article &quot;The War in Westeros and Just War Theory&quot;, Richard H. Corrigan uses Robb to illustrate the concepts of just cause and right intention in the decision to go to war: &quot;Robb is not only fighting this war to ensure that his fellow Northerners have a just king [Robb&#x27;s cause]. He is also doing it to avenge his father, Ned, and to recover his sisters Arya and Sansa [Robb&#x27;s intention].&quot; Corrigan speculates that Robb may be suffering from cognitive dissonance and says that, ethically, once Robb has achieved his cause, he is obligated to cease fighting even if he has not yet avenged his family.

Robb&#x27;s decision to renege on his promise to marry one of Walder Frey&#x27;s daughters features heavily in the fifth chapter of Tim Phillips and Rebecca Clare&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones and Business&quot;, &quot;Keep Your Word: Robb Stark discovers too late the dangers of broken promises in business deals.&quot;

<doc id="978322" wikidata="Q3343470" url="?curid=978322" title="Noranda Mines">
<text>Noranda Inc. was a mining and metallurgy company originally from Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada. It was listed on the TSX under the symbol NRD.LV. After eventually acquiring a large interest in rival mining company Falconbridge, it merged with that company in 2005. The combined company continued under the name Falconbridge Limited, ending the Noranda name. Only one year later in 2006 Falconbridge was acquired by the Swiss-based mining company Xstrata. On 2 May 2013 ownership of Xstrata was fully acquired by mining behemoth Glencore.

==History and operations==

Noranda was incorporated in 1922 as Noranda Mines under the leadership of James Y. Murdoch to exploit the Horne deposit, discovered by Edmond Henry Horne on mineral claims he staked in 1920 near Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. Extraction of copper began on 17 December 1927. Although extraction was originally predicted to last for only three years, additional reserves (the gigantic &quot;Giant H Orebody&quot;) were quickly discovered; the mine would form the backbone of Noranda&#x27;s operations until reserves were exhausted in 1976.

Beginning in 1930, Noranda diversified by acquiring holdings in the forestry, oil, manufacturing, and automotive industries. In 1931, the company opened the CCR refinery in Montréal-Est, which processes all the copper produced by the Horne Smelter.

Noranda gained its first international property in 1938 with the purchase of the Empresa Minera de Nicaragua gold mine in Nicaragua.

The company gained a large interest in Kerr Addison Gold Mines in 1945.

In 1955 it opened the Gaspé Copper Mines, and in 1963 Canadian Electrolytic Zinc (CEZ), in which Noranda held a large stake, began production.

In 1967, Noranda divested itself at $80 per share of its holdings in Denison Mines, which it had purchased in 1964 for $12 to $18 per share. A sum of $80mn was devoted to Potash mines in Saskatchewan, while $50mn purchased a 51% stake in the Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation earlier that year, as well as an investment in Pacific Coast Company, an aluminum products manufacturer based in Cleveland, Ohio.

Following the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, Noranda reclaimed its 49% share in its subsidiary Chile Canadian Mines. The company then invested $600,000 of new capital in its Chilean mines, the first major mining investment after the coup, securing the right to the Andacollo copper reserves in northern Chile in 1976. The year 1973 also saw the company expand into aluminum with the opening of an aluminum smelter in New Madrid, Missouri, and the oil business with the formation of Canadian Hunter.

Asset management companies Brascan and Caisse de Dépôt gained effective control of Noranda with a $1 billion CAD investment in 1981.

In 1984 Noranda Mines changed its name to Noranda Inc., as a reflection of its wide diversification. Also in 1984, the company became a large player in the electronics scrap and recycling business by purchasing Micro Metallics Corp.

In 1995 Noranda gained full control of Brunswick Mining and Smelting, a zinc mine and smelting company in New Brunswick; they opened a battery recycling facility one year later. Also in 1995 Noranda entered Latin America with the purchase of a 25% stake in the Refimet smelter outside of Antofagasta, Chile. Noranda obtained 100% control in 1998 and ownership of that site aided later expansion into Latin America.

Noranda announced that it would divest itself from all industries unrelated to mining and metals in 1997, and completed the transition the following year, removing itself from the forestry and oil and gas industries.

In August 2000, Noranda was the top miner in Canada.

The company gained a 34% stake in the huge Antamina copper-zinc mine in Peru, which opened in 2001.

In 2002 Noranda opened a large aluminum foil plant in Tennessee.

It expanded its recycling business with the opening of an electronic hardware recycling facility in Brampton, Ontario in 2003.

Noranda expanded its aluminum business in 2004 by gaining a 50% interest in the Gramercy alumina refinery in Louisiana and associated Jamaican bauxite deposits.

By 2005, the company had operations in 18 countries.

===Two mergers===
Noranda had bought 19.9% of rival mining company Falconbridge in 1988, which was raised to a 58.4% stake in 2002.

In 2004 China Minmetals was interested in buying Noranda, and completed negotiations with the Noranda board in October 2004 with a sale price of $6.7 billion, which caused the Canadian federal government to review its foreign investment policy. Bruce Flatt and Brascan favoured the Chinese offer.

Frustrated by the Canadian government, Noranda proposed a merger with Falconbridge in January 2005. In June 2005 Noranda and Falconbridge completed their merger, with Noranda essentially purchasing Falconbridge outright. However, the combined company continued under the name Falconbridge Limited, ending the Noranda name as a large mining company. Brascan saw its stake in the new company reduced to 20%, and in August 2005 they sold their share to Xstrata.

Less than a year after completing its merger with Falconbridge, the new company was fully acquired by Xstrata. The Noranda name continues for companies with Noranda Aluminum, which was the spun off by Xstrata, and the Noranda Income Fund which is a large zinc refinery in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec.

==Scotland and Wales==
Noranda Mines also operated in the UK in the early 70&#x27;s with active exploration programs in Scotland and north Wales. The exploration program consisted of soil and stream sampling and limited Induced Polarisation and fluxgate magnetometer surveys. These programs were sufficiently advanced to give rise to drilling programs in Snowdonia (Hafod y llan) either side of the Watkin path, and also in Wester Ross just outside Locharron. Copper mineralisation was encountered in the Welsh drilling program but essentially nothing in Wester Ross.
Drilling in Snowdonia was with a hand portable x-ray rig capable of reaching approximately 100 ft and in Wester Ross with a Boyles Bros. rotary rig drilling to approximately 1000 ft.

<doc id="978335" wikidata="Q290112" url="?curid=978335" title="T. J. Cloutier">
<text>Thomas James &quot;T. J.&quot; Cloutier (born October 13, 1939) is a professional poker player from Richardson, Texas. He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2006. Cloutier was also briefly a professional football player in the Canadian Football League.

==Early years==
Cloutier was born in Albany, California, and attended the University of California, Berkeley on an athletic scholarship for football and baseball and played in the 1959 Rose Bowl. He later dropped out of college because of family financial hardship.

Cloutier was drafted into the United States Army. After the Army, he played football in the Canadian Football League for the Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes, but an injury cut his career short.

After his football career ended, Cloutier started a food company, but it was not successful, so following the end of his first marriage, he moved to Texas to work on oil rigs. On his off days, he began to play poker, and quit his job after realizing that he was winning more money playing poker than working. He started playing poker when he was a caddy at a golf course and played poker after the rounds.

In addition to poker, Cloutier is well known for his high-stakes craps sessions.

==Poker career==
===World Series of Poker===
Cloutier specializes in playing tournament poker, especially no-limit and pot limit hold&#x27;em. He is the only person in the history of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) to have won events in three types of Omaha played at the World Series — Pot Limit High, Limit High, and Limit 8-or-Better High-low split. Cloutier has won a total of six WSOP bracelets in his career, in addition to many other titles in various kinds of poker games.

He has placed four times in the top five in the Main Event of the World Series of Poker, including two second-place finishes, in 1985, losing to Bill Smith, and 2000, losing to Chris Ferguson. Cloutier also finished in fifth place in 1988, won by Johnny Chan, and in third place in 1998, won by Scotty Nguyen.

In 2009, Cloutier was one of numerous players turned away from the Main Event, as registration was capped on that particular day. He did admit it was own fault for not signing up earlier and not looking for special treatment.

===WSOP bracelets===
In January 2010, The Plano Pawn Shop auctioned off Cloutier&#x27;s 2005 bracelet on eBay for $4,006.

===World Poker Tour===
Cloutier also plays in World Poker Tour (WPT) events, where his highest finish is third in the 2003 Legends of Poker event, won by fellow professional Mel Judah. He has also been featured in the Ultimate Poker Challenge, the National Heads-Up Poker Championship, Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament and Poker Royale: Battle of the Ages.

As of 2024, his total live tournament winnings exceed $10,500,000.

==Poker writings==
Cloutier is the co-author (with Tom McEvoy) of four books on poker:
* &quot;Championship Tournament Practice Hands&quot;
* &quot;Championship Holdem&quot;
* &quot;Championship Omaha&quot;
* &quot;Championship No-Limit and Pot Limit Hold&#x27;em&quot;.

He has also written &quot;How To Win The Championship: Hold&#x27;em Strategies For The Final Table&quot;, a book covering tournament strategy with an emphasis on the final few tables.

Cloutier formerly wrote for &quot;Card Player&quot; magazine.

==Media==
* He features in the computer game &quot;World Class Poker with T.J. Cloutier&quot;.
* He appears in the &quot;Prince of Poker&quot; episode of the History Channel series &quot;Breaking Vegas&quot;.

<text>Dr. Cayetano Coll y Toste (November 30, 1850 – November 19, 1930), was a Puerto Rican historian and writer, who served as Official Historian of Puerto Rico from 1913 until his death in 1930. He was the founder and editor of the fourteen volumes of the “Historical Bulletin of Puerto Rico.” He was the patriarch of a prominent family of Puerto Rican educators, politicians and writers.

==Early years==
Coll y Toste was born in the city of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education. In 1863, he entered the Jesuits&#x27; Seminary College in San Juan from where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Philosophy in 1868. In 1872, Coll y Toste went to Barcelona, Spain and enrolled in the &quot;School of Medicine&quot; of the University of Barcelona. From here he graduated as a &quot;Doctor in Medicine and Surgery&quot; in 1872. During his stay in Spain, he was able to study historical documents relating to Puerto Rico which he later found to be useful to him.

==Historian==
In 1874, Coll y Toste returned to the island where he set up his own medical practice in Arecibo. In 1891, he was named director of the Catholic Hospital of Arecibo. In his free time, he developed both a love of and an interest in literature. Not only did he become interested in investigating the history of Puerto Rico, but, he also took an active interest in the island&#x27;s politics and was the founder and director of a publication called &quot;El Ramillete&quot;. He also collaborated with the &quot;Revista Puertorriqueña&quot; (Puerto Rican Review), &quot;La Semana Politica&quot; (Political Weekly) and &quot;Plumas Amigas&quot; (Pen Pals).

==Political activity==

In 1897, a year before the Spanish–American War, Coll y Toste was Sub-Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce and was named Regional Governor of Northern Puerto Rico by the Spanish Crown. After the war, Coll y Toste was named Civil Secretary and in 1900 Commissioner of the Interior by General Davis the military governor appointed by the United States. He held the position of Secretary of the Government and he also became a delegate to Puerto Rico&#x27;s House of Representatives. In 1913 Coll y Toste was named Official Historian of Puerto Rico, preceded by Salvador Brau. Among Coll y Toste&#x27;s other civil positions were the Presidency of the Puerto Rican Historical Academy and of the Ateneo Puertorriqueño.

==Written works==
Among his many written works are:
* &quot;El Boletin Historico de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Historical Bulletin of Puerto Rico&quot;)
* &quot;Cronicas de Arecibo&quot; (Arecibo Annals)
* &quot;Leyendas y Tradiciones Puertorriqueñas&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rican Legends and Traditions&quot;)

His research into the history of Puerto Rico gave people an insight into the island from the time of the Taínos up until 1927. One of his works, &quot;The Indo-Antillean Vocabulary&quot;, is valuable in understanding the way of life of the Taínos. His works are required reading in Puerto Rican high schools and universities.

==Later years==

Coll y Toste was married to Adela, daughter of José Cuchí y Arnau former mayor of Arecibo. Together they had six children, among them José Coll y Cuchí, who founded the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, who was a President of Puerto Rico House of Representatives.

Spain bestowed upon Coll y Toste the title of &quot;Comendador de la Real Orden Americana de Isabel la Catolica&quot; (Knight of the American Royal Order of Isabel the Catholic) and the Government of Venezuela honored Coll y Toste with the title of &quot;Caballero de la Orden de Bolivar&quot; (Knight of the Order of Bolivar). Cayetano Coll y Toste died on November 19, 1930, in the City of Madrid. His granddaughter, Isabel Cuchí Coll, who was an author and the director of the &quot;Sociedad de Autores Puertorriqueños&quot; (Society of Puerto Rican Authors), published his work &quot;Historia de la esclavitud en Puerto Rico (información y documentos)&quot; (History of Slavery in Puerto Rico (documents and information)) in 1972.

==Family==
Coll y Toste was also the patriarch of a Puerto Rican family of educators, politicians and writers. Besides his granddaughter, Isabel Cuchí Coll, both Coll y Toste&#x27;s sons were politicians. José Coll y Cuchí was the founder of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, was a President of Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Another grand daughter, Edna Coll, was an educator and author. She was one of the founders of the Academy of Fine Arts in Puerto Rico, and his grandson, Cayetano Coll y Pujol was a prominent attorney and judge in Puerto Rico. His great-grandson, (Edna&#x27;s son), Jose &quot;Fufi&quot; Santori Coll was a former BSN basketball player, coach and television sportscaster. Another great-grandson, Eduardo Morales Coll was also President of the Ateneo, President of the Institute of Puerto Rican Literature, Academic of the Puerto Rican Academy of the Spanish Language and also an Academic of the Puerto Rican Academy of Arts and Sciences and a University professor of Law, History of Puerto Rico and of Cultural Anthropology.

==Legacy==
Puerto Rico has honored his memory by naming many public buildings and an avenue after him. The government named the public Arecibo regional hospital &quot;Hospital Regional Cayetano Coll y Toste&quot;.

<text>Roger Quarles Mills (March 30, 1832September 2, 1911) was an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician who represented Texas in the United States House of Representatives from 1873 to 1892 and the United States Senate from 1892 to 1899. He served as an officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

As the leading Democrat on the influential United States House Committee on Ways and Means during the first Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison administrations, Mills advocated for trade liberalization. Despite his efforts, he did not succeed in passing significant tariff reduction legislation. Additionally, he was unable to block the enactment of the McKinley Tariff of 1890 after Republicans gained control of the House on a pro-tariff platform. Mills also ran for Speaker after Democrats regained control of the House in 1891 but was defeated by Charles F. Crisp.

==Early life==
Born in Todd County, Kentucky, Mills attended common schools before relocating to Texas in 1849. There, he pursued legal studies, passed the bar exam, and commenced his law practice in Corsicana at the age of 20, following an exception made by the Texas legislature to the usual age requirement. He served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 1859 until 1860. Mills then enlisted in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. Throughout the conflict, he participated in various engagements, including serving as a private in the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek. Later, as a colonel, he commanded the 10th Texas Infantry Regiment at Arkansas Post, Chickamauga (where he led the brigade of Gen. James Deshler during part of the battle), Missionary Ridge and the Atlanta Campaign.

==U.S. Representative==
He was then elected as a Democrat to the US House of Representatives and served from 1873 to 1892. In 1891, Mills was a candidate in the Democratic caucus for Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, but he was defeated by Charles F. Crisp (1845–1896) of Georgia.

During the 1880s, amidst rising Prohibition sentiment in Texas, Mills refused to make any political concessions. In one speech, he reportedly declared, &quot;If lightning were to strike all the drunkards, there would not be a live Prohibition party in Texas.&quot; (Mills claimed to have been misquoted and that he had said &quot;there would not be many [members of the party] left.&quot;) Elsewhere, he was said to have vowed, &quot;A good sluice of pine top whiskey would improve the morals of the Dallas [Prohibition] convention and the average Prohibitionist.&quot; (Mills again offered a correction, denying he had used the words &quot;average Prohibitionist.&quot;).

Mills quickly regained recognition as one of the ablest, albeit hottest-tempered, debaters on the Democratic side of the House. He was commonly agreed to be a man &quot;possessed of the demon of work.&quot; The reporter Frank G. Carpenter described him as true as steel and unpretentious in dress: &quot;He is tall, straight and big chested,&quot; he wrote in 1888. &quot;The distance between the top button of his high vest and the small of his back is longer than the width of the shoulders of the ordinary man, and he has a biceps which, if put into training, would knock down an ox. He is a fighter, too, and goes into this Congressional struggle with a brain trained to warfare... He is a successful man, and one who inspires confidence.&quot;

===Chairmanship of the Committee on Ways and Means===
Mills had made the tariff his special study and long been recognized as one of the leading authorities on the Democratic side. After the defeat of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman William Morrison in the 1886 election, Mills became the next chair of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means when the 50th Congress met. His selection, according to Ida Tarbell, a historian on the tariff, &quot;was a red rag to the high protectionists, for Mr. Mills was an out-and-out free trader.&quot; Debate over the tariff issue had been thrust upon the United States by President Grover Cleveland in his annual December message to Congress on December 6, 1887. He requested for Congress to pass a drastic reduction of the tariff on many manufactured goods to promote trade and reduce the cost of living for ordinary citizens. Indeed, Chairman Mills, using the Walker Tariff of 1846 as a guideline, had been drafting a bill since September 1887 that would address several of the proposals included by Cleveland in his December message. As it turned out, most of Mills&#x27;s work went for naught, as he later explained: &quot;When I got to work with my brethren on the bill I found that it would not go, and I had to abandon my ad valorem tariff bill. The schoolmaster had not been sufficiently around, to bring our people back to the Democratic principle of taxation as to value.&quot; The bill became known as the &quot;Mills Tariff Bill of 1888.&quot; The Mills Bill was reported out of the Ways and Means Committee in April 1888.

The bill provided for a reduction of the duties on sugar, earthenware, glassware, plate glass, woolen goods and other articles; the substitution of ad valorem for specific duties in many cases; and the placing of lumber (of certain kinds), hemp, wool, flax, borax, tin plates, salt and other articles on the free list. The bill looked likely to split the Democratic Party. Just two years previously, the high tariff wing of the Democratic Party had been able to muster 35 votes in the House. However, the Mills Bill had now become so highly partisan that when the bill was passed by the Democratic House on July 21, 1888, only four Democratic representatives voted against it. The high-tariff wing of the Democratic Party had largely been wiped out by the passage of the Mills Bill of 1888.

Although the Mills Bill passed the House, the Republican Senate amended it heavily, and it never passed into law. Instead, it became the chief issue in the 1888 presidential election. Critics warned that American manufacturers could not compete against the flood of manufactured goods from Britain, and campaign crowds marched the streets chanting, &quot;No! no! no Free Trade!&quot; (However, the bill was not anything close to being a free-trade measure but offered an average reduction of only seven percent, and many items were left untouched.) &quot;If Mills of Texas does not shut down, many other mills will have to,&quot; a California newspaper warned. In the 1888 election, Republican Benjamin Harrison, a strong high-tariff supporter lost the popular vote nationwide to Cleveland, but Harrison managed to narrowly win both swing states of New York and Indiana and so won the presidency in the Electoral College-based, largely by the tariff issue.

===1891 speakership candidacy===
Mills was known to have aspirations to be speaker after the retirement of John G. Carlisle. In late 1891, with the House returning to Democratic control, the Texas representative put himself in the running against Representative Charles Crisp from Georgia. Before the caucus met, Mills had 120 votes pledged to him, and if all of them had kept their word, he would have won, but only 105 did so on the final, thirtieth, ballot, against Crisp&#x27;s 119. The reason, apparently, was that Mills refused to make deals.

Some two dozen members wanted a guarantee of specific committee assignments in return for their support, but Mills would have none of it. Reportedly, Representative William Springer of Illinois, who was also contending to be speaker, offered to drop out if Mills would appoint him chair of Ways and Means and was told gruffly to put his offer in writing. As a result, the night before the caucus voted, Springer withdrew on Crisp&#x27;s behalf, and Crisp made him chairman of Ways and Means, subsequently. To Representative Tom Johnson of Cleveland, one of Mills&#x27;s most earnest backers, the Texas representative&#x27;s conduct looked like political insanity. &quot;I wish you wouldn&#x27;t be a fool,&quot; he burst out; &quot;give me two chairmanships and ask me no questions and I will elect you on the next ballot.&quot; He got only a shake of the head in reply.

The regularity with which Mills lost his temper made many of his party friends worry that he lacked the self-control necessary to be speaker. The party&#x27;s job would be hard enough without what one newspaper called Mills&#x27;s &quot;tempestuous style.&quot; His selection would have signaled that the Democratic Party&#x27;s main agenda would be lowering the tariff drastically. Crisp was much less associated with tariff reform than with the coinage of free silver, which, to most Southern Democrats, was the top issue by late 1891. Among the Silver Democrats, it did not help Mills to have former President Cleveland&#x27;s backing or, among those favoring the presidential nomination of Cleveland&#x27;s rival, Senator David Bennett Hill of New York, that Hill threw his weight behind Crisp&#x27;s candidacy, too.

Mills took badly to his rejection, issuing a letter that was quickly made public that the Democratic Party had been hurt more than he by his rejection as well as threatening that &quot;a large element that has been voting with us [would] abandon us&quot; in the coming election unless those who had defeated him were met with rebuke by their party.

==US Senator==
Mills was elected to the US Senate from Texas in 1892 to fill the vacant seat of John H. Reagan and continued to serve in that post until 1899.

In 1893, when President Grover Cleveland sought repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, Mills gave loyal support. Silver coinage was popular with both parties in Texas, and Democrats in particular felt that Mills had betrayed them. His action probably cost him re-election in 1898.

Other friends also noticed a change in him. His old colleague and co-worker in tariff reform, former Representative William L. Wilson of West Virginia, wrote in his diary in 1896, &quot;Poor Mills, how he seems to have gone to pieces since the time when he was leading the tariff reform forces in the House, and a welcome and strong speaker on that great issue all over the country. Today he made one of the most extreme and wild jingo speeches in the Senate on the Cuban question that has marked the whole debate. Not less erratic has been his course for two years past on the financial question.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
He died in Corsicana, Texas. Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, was named after him.

<text>Bowen is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the southwest of the Montes Haemus, on the edge of a small lunar mare named the Lacus Doloris. It was named after American astronomer Ira S. Bowen. It is distinguished only by having a relatively flat floor, rather than being bowl-shaped like most small craters. Bowen was previously designated Manilius A. The crater Manilius is located to the south, at the opposite shore of the Lacus.
